Those in the middle-income quintiles have seen their wealth grow by more than lower and higher incomes because as these quintiles contain the highest percentage of young families they are more likely to be entering the housing market and buying a first home (and also taking advantage of low interest rates). It all makes for a complicated picture, and a tough job for the government to explain. Over the past five years, middle- and low-income Australia has actually done quite well compared with the rest, but given the comparison with the pre-GFC years and the changes in wealth, the tough thing will be convincing the electorate that a relatively good performance deserves absolute reward at the ballot box.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's factories are boosting their output sharply amid signs that the pickup in the economy is spreading to the recession-battered manufacturing sector. After falling in April and May, an across-the-board expansion led by the transport sector \u2013 including a buoyant automotive industry \u2013 saw production rise by 1.9% in June. The increase was welcomed by employers' groups, who hope the Bank of England will help cement industry's fledgling recovery by committing on Wednesday to an extended period of low interest rates. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: \"After the disappointing figures we saw in May, this is positive news for the economy.\" He added: \"But we mustn't become complacent. The level of UK output is more than 3% below its pre-recession peak in 2008, and the manufacturing sector still faces major challenges over the months ahead. The government must do more to refocus its priorities towards policies that will enable businesses to drive the recovery.\" Mark Carney, the new governor of the Bank of England, will on Wednesday outline Threadneedle Street's attitude to providing forward guidance to the financial markets about the future path of borrowing costs. The expectation in the City is that even after the upbeat figures of recent weeks, interest rates will not rise until 2015 at the earliest. Tuesday's data from the Office for National Statistics showed that in the three months to June \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend than the June figures alone \u2013 factory output was up by 0.7%. The month-on-month improvement for June was 1.9%. Industrial production, which includes North Sea output and the domestic energy sector as well as manufacturing, grew by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2013 following a 1.1% jump in June. The ONS figures prompted the National Institute for Economic and Social Research to raise its quarterly growth forecast for the UK economy from 0.6% in the three months to June to 0.7% in the quarter ending in July. The thinktank said the increase was helping to mop up some of the spare capacity in the economy generated by the deep recession of 2008-09, a downturn that was particularly severe on manufacturing. Factory production dropped by 15% between the start of 2008 and the end of 2009 \u2013 double the rate of decline suffered by the economy overall \u2013 and after a slight recovery in 2010, manufacturing then entered a double-dip recession that has left output still more than 10% below its previous peak. Despite official GDP estimates of 0.6% growth in the second quarter, the level of GDP is 3.3% lower than it was in the first quarter of 2008. NIESR said: \"Consumer spending growth has underpinned the recent gains in economic momentum, in spite of the continued decline of real consumer wages. Our monthly GDP estimates are consistent with this pattern continuing in the three months ending in July 2013.\" The ONS said manufacturing output was now at its highest level since 2012, and said transport equipment \u2013 where production grew by more than 5% \u2013 was the standout sector in June. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: \"Manufacturing output surged in June with the strongest pace of increase since the end of 2010. In contrast to the significant sector divergence we've seen in the data in recent years all parts of manufacturing posted gains with chemicals, electrical equipment and transport showing particular strength over the past three months. The production data gives further weight to the view that manufacturing activity will continue to gain pace, becoming a more important contributor to growth in the year ahead.\" Nida Ali, economic adviser to the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club, said car production was one of the highlights in a broad recovery for manufacturers. She said: \"The preliminary GDP figures had suggested a solid increase in manufacturing output in June, but a monthly rise of 1.9% still came as a big upside surprise. The broad-based nature of the manufacturing pickup paints a positive picture, but there are some obvious sector hotspots. The healthy increase in car production supports the strong data on new car registrations, as well as suggesting evidence of export success. \"The manufacturing outlook has perked up considerably in recent months. On top of growth in the second quarter, survey data points to a further expansion in the third quarter and there are increasing signs that the recovery is broadening out from the consumer sector into exports and investment. Although this is encouraging, the manufacturing sector took a real battering during the crisis, so there is still a long way to go before pre-crisis levels will be restored.\"",

      "bodyText": "Bakery chain Greggs said it would take two to three years to turn the business around as it issued another profits warning and said sales had been hit by the heatwave. Shares in the group fell 7% as it said the hot weather curbed Britons' appetite for warm pasties, driving a 3.2% fall in like-for-like sales over the five weeks to 3 August, with a \u00a32m impact on profits. The group is also taking a \u00a31m hit on reorganisation costs, meaning profits will be \u00a33m lower than expected. Its chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said he had completed a strategic review of the business and would focus on adapting its product ranges to best take advantage of the \u00a36bn \"food on the go\" market. He said a new pizza range had quickly become one of the bestselling lines, and other product upgrades were in the pipeline. \"Greggs is a much loved brand and we are confident we can leverage our heritage,\" said Whiteside, who joined from Punch Taverns in February. \"We will spend the next two to three years reshaping the business as we build the platform for long term sustainable profit growth.\" Greggs is stalling its store opening programme and will instead focus on relocations and refitting existing shops. It refurbished 90 shops in the first half of 2013, and expects to have completed a total of to 240 refits by the end of the year. The company abandoned plans to build a second savoury factory in the East Midlands, as well as its Greggs Moment coffee shops which it had been trialling since 2011. It is not extending its agreement to stock Greggs products in Iceland stores. The group warned in April that full-year profits were likely to below market expectations, blaming the cold weather, tough competition and \"promiscuous\" shoppers for an unexpected fall in sales of sausage rolls and sandwiches. Sahill Shan, analyst at N+1Singer, said: \"While further downgrades are disappointing, the underlying like-for-like trend and the strategic update should be viewed as a basis from which a recovery thesis has good scope to emerge.\" The interim dividend was left unchanged from the first half last year at 6p a share.",

      "bodyText": "Bigger is no longer better \u2013 at least for supermarkets. After more than two decades of opening ever larger stores, shopping habits are changing fast and supermarket bosses are having to hastily rethink their business model. They are chopping back the size of their largest stores as shoppers start to buy less, but more frequently and locally, and as traditional retailers face increasing competition from the internet. Next week shoppers will get an idea of what might be in store for them when Tesco reopens its Watford hypermarket, with a whole array of new ideas designed to pull in families for more than just the weekly shop. The Watford Extra shop, initially opened in 1988, will feature the first Giraffe restaurant outlet inside a Tesco \u2013 the grocer bought the chain in March for \u00a349m \u2013 along with a nail salon and a \"community space\" for local groups to use. There will also be a branch of Harris &amp; Hoole, the coffee shop chain backed by the grocer and a Euphorium artisan bakery. At the vast Stockton-on-Tees branch Tesco is installing a soft-play zone and a gym which will offer pilates classes. In Coventry Tesco is testing out a new carvery restaurant called Decks that will serve up roast dinners for \u00a35.50. Sports Direct outlets could also soon be springing up inside Tesco stores: the grocer is in talks to rent space to the sportswear chain. It has already the sliced nearly 40% off one hypermarket in the Czech Republic by renting the space to Sports Direct and C&amp;A. The move increased the number of visitors by 25% and trading profits rose by \u00a30.5m. Tesco's UK boss Chris Bush told The Grocer magazine last week: \"In the past, large hypermarkets were popular because they offered a massive range of products and people liked being able to buy everything under one roof \u2013 it made life easier. The internet has changed all that \u2013 people don't even need to leave their homes to go shopping and more people are using convenience stores for regular top-up shops. So we need to give them good reasons to come to our larger stores.\" His view of superstores now is not one where shoppers wheel their trolleys down aisles filled entirely with giant bottles of Coke or electrical goods but as destinations where \"customers can have a meal or coffee with their friends and family, browse for clothes and get their hair done. They can go to yoga classes or attend cookery classes in a space available for the local community to use.\" Tesco called an end to the supermarket \"space race\" a year ago, saying it was ditching its long-term plan of opening ever larger stores across the country. It is also hacking back the size of up to 50 of its biggest UK supermarkets. A further 20 stores in central Europe, some of which are as big as 14,000 sq metres (150,000 sq ft), also face a prune. Philip Clarke, Tesco's chief executive says that the company is unlikely to open any more stores over 7,500 sq metres in future, and all its existing stores over that size are likely to change markedly. Industry insiders have said it was probably a mistake for any supermarket to open stores over 5,500-6,500 sq metres \u2013 suggesting the pruning job could be bigger than Clarke is so far ready to admit. Tesco is the first to admit that it needs to take drastic action to slim down its massive shops. But there are at least 137 other UK supermarkets over 5,500 sq metres, on top of the 238 Tesco owns in the UK, suggesting others may have to follow suit in future. \"This could be just the beginning,\" says Dave McCarthy, retail analyst at Investec. \"I think there will be a lot more over time.\" The large store is not just a UK phenomenon. Retailers such as Walmart in the US and Carrefour in Europe are all trying to work out how to prevent their giant stores becoming white elephants. Once the bright shiny face of the future, shoppers have fallen out of love with huge supermarkets. With the dawn of the internet, it's more convenient, and often cheaper, to buy large non-food items such as TVs and sofas from home. Rising petrol prices mean that driving to out of town stores is more expensive and those trying to watch their budget are choosing to shop more frequently, and more locally, rather than risk the temptations on offer at a hypermarket. Meanwhile, buying groceries online is increasingly attractive, particularly now it's possible to pick them up at a convenient time via click-and-collect services. While there is mounting concern about the decline of the UK's town centres, out-of-town stores have been witnessing a much bigger drop in visitor numbers. In the early months of this year, according to the British Retail Consortium/Springboard footfall monitor, the number of out-of-town shoppers fell 4.3%, compared to a 2.9% drop on the high street. With fewer visitors, large stores can seem dreary and cavernous. As Tesco's chief executive Phil Clarke told analysts: \"The worst thing is going into a store which is short on customers and big on space.\" What's more, huge stores are just no longer cost effective. Tesco and its rivals earn little profit from selling electronics, CDs or DVDs, while the space needed to display them needs heating, lighting and staff. Asda boss Andy Clarke has said he wants to work with well-known local independent outlets, such as butchers and bakers, to create more life and colour in stores. The US-owned chain already has branches of McDonald's and Disney concessions in some stores and plans to do more such ventures. Asda has also tried letting community groups use spare space for dance lessons and scout groups and even hosted a driving test centre and provided rooms for midwives and police officers. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, says: \"It is premature to say that hypermarkets are dead but they are having to evolve to remain relevant. In five years time they will look very different.\"",

A further 20 stores in central Europe, some of which are as big as 14,000 sq metres (150,000 sq ft), also face a prune.</p> <p>Philip Clarke, Tesco's chief executive says that the company is unlikely to open any more stores over 7,500 sq metres in future, and all its existing stores over that size are likely to change markedly. Industry insiders have said it was probably a mistake for any supermarket to open stores over 5,500-6,500 sq metres \u2013 suggesting the pruning job could be bigger than Clarke is so far ready to admit.</p> <p>Tesco is the first to admit that it needs to take drastic action to slim down its massive shops. But there are at least 137 other UK supermarkets over 5,500 sq metres, on top of the 238 Tesco owns in the UK, suggesting others may have to follow suit in future.</p> <p>\"This could be just the beginning,\" says Dave McCarthy, retail analyst at Investec. \"I think there will be a lot more over time.\"</p> <p>The large store is not just a UK phenomenon. Retailers such as Walmart in the US and Carrefour in Europe are all trying to work out how to prevent their giant stores becoming white elephants.</p> <p>Once the bright shiny face of the future, shoppers have fallen out of love with huge supermarkets. With the dawn of the internet, it's more convenient, and often cheaper, to buy large non-food items such as TVs and sofas from home.</p> <p>Rising petrol prices mean that driving to out of town stores is more expensive and those trying to watch their budget are choosing to shop more frequently, and more locally, rather than risk the temptations on offer at a hypermarket. Meanwhile, buying groceries online is increasingly attractive, particularly now it's possible to pick them up at a convenient time via click-and-collect services.</p> <p>While there is mounting concern about the decline of the UK's town centres, out-of-town stores have been witnessing a much bigger drop in visitor numbers. In the early months of this year, according to the British Retail Consortium/Springboard footfall monitor, the number of out-of-town shoppers fell 4.3%, compared to a 2.9% drop on the high street.</p> <p>With fewer visitors, large stores can seem dreary and cavernous. As Tesco's chief executive Phil Clarke told analysts: \"The worst thing is going into a store which is short on customers and big on space.\"</p> <p>What's more, huge stores are just no longer cost effective. Tesco and its rivals earn little profit from selling electronics, CDs or DVDs, while the space needed to display them needs heating, lighting and staff.</p> <p>Asda boss Andy Clarke has said he wants to work with well-known local independent outlets, such as butchers and bakers, to create more life and colour in stores. The US-owned chain already has branches of McDonald's and Disney concessions in some stores and plans to do more such ventures.</p> <p>Asda has also tried letting community groups use spare space for dance lessons and scout groups and even hosted a driving test centre and provided rooms for midwives and police officers.</p> <p>Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, says: \"It is premature to say that hypermarkets are dead but they are having to evolve to remain relevant.

      "bodyText": "And that's all for the day. Back tomorrow, when the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report and historic 'forward guidance' will probably dominate the morning (see 4.30pm) A reminder of the main events today: \u2022 Italy's recession has lasted for a record-breaking eight quarters, with the news that GDP shrank by another 0.2% in April to June. The data underlines the scale of the slump in Southern Europe, but was less than analysts expected \u2013 offering hope that the downturn is easing. Details and reaction from 10.03am \u2022 The UK economy appears to be strengthening. The NIESR thinktank predicted this afternoon that Britain's GDP grew by 0.7% in the last three months (see 3.14pm). \u2022 Several pieces of economic data also suggested that the UK recovery was gathering pace, including a rise in industrial production, increased car sales, and higher house prices. See 12.16pm for a round-up. \u2022 However, with living standards falling, opposition MPs and the TUC argued that many households are failing to feel the benefits. See 12.41pm \u2022 The IMF has warned Germany that isn't immune to the problems in the rest of the eurozone (see 5.23pm).... although its factory orders did jump in June (see 11.20am) \u2022 In Greece, tourism may be picking up (see 2.23pm).... but deflation remains an issue (see 11.11am). See you tomorrow. Until then, thanks and goodnight. GW The International Monetary Fund has warned Germany this evening that the problems in the eurozone will drag on its economic growth this year, and urged it to avoid too much austerity. In its latest assessment of the German economy, the IMF stated: The outlook for the remainder of 2013 and next year is heavily dependent on a gradual recovery in the rest of the euro area and a sustained reduction in uncertainty. Consumption is expected to continue to expand robustly this year given favorable labor market conditions and wage agreements. Exports to the euro area are expected to recover only gradually. Uncertainty is expected to continue to have an amplifying impact on investment through the end of the year and assumed to diminish subsequently. Growth for 2013 as a whole is thus projected at around 0.3 percent, reflecting still below potential growth in the second half of the year. Growth in 2014 is projected to return to potential. And with a general election looming next month, the IMF went on to list a series of ways in which the German economy could be unseated. Risks included: \u2022 Should the alleviation of euro area uncertainty and a gradual recovery in the region fail to materialize, German growth would remain below potential for longer. \u2022 A rise in financial stress in the euro area could interact with already weak regional demand and uncertainty and amplify inward spillovers. \u2022 Weaker global growth prospects could compound these risks. \u2022An extended period of low growth could also reduce the economy\u2019s potential. The full report is online here. And here's the press release. Despite today's upbeat data, Europe's stock markets have closed in the red. While on Wall Street, shares are down despite the US trade gap shrinking in June (details here). Here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 15 points at 6604, -0.23% \u2022 German DAX: down 105 points at 8296, -1.26% \u2022 French CAC: down 18 points at 4032, -0.46% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 31 points at 8529, -0.37% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 74 points at 16683, -0.44% And in New York, the Dow Jones index is down 97 points at 6604, - 0.6%. With trading volumes low, it appears that many investors are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the autumn. Peter Garnry, equity strategist at Saxo, predicts that markets could push higher in the remaining months of 2013: Even though the S&amp;P 500 is up some 26 percent since November history tells us that since World War II that stocks often continue to rise - that\u2019s what we call the momentum effect, and that could kill every bear in the market, because when crowds of retail investors enter the market it carries equity evaluations higher. That is why despite the steep rise in US equities we could move higher in the next couple of months. City economists are preparing for tomorrow's big event - the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report. Governor Mark Carney is expected to use the occasion to begin a new era of monetary policy by explicitly giving 'forward guidance' , outlining how the Bank sees the economic situation and the conditions under which borrowing costs could rise . That guidance will probably pin future interest rate levels to economic indicators such as the jobless rate. But there's much excitement over what Carney, who only took over at the start of July, has in store. Dr Neil Bentley, deputy director-general at the CBI, reckons the new policy could help the UK economic recovery: Forward Guidance could provide a welcome injection of certainty around interest rates for businesses and consumers. As evidence of an improvement in the economy continues to build, additional clarity around monetary policy could give the boost needed to get back up to a sustainable level of growth. Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics believes that, despite the encouraging economic news in recent days, the Bank will still announce that rates will stay low until UK unemployment has fallen to a certain point. She told Sky News that Carney will want to ensure people don't expect interest rates to rise as the UK economy recovers. The Bank is also planning an 'unprecedented' briefing for City economists after the event, according to Barclays Capital. Forward guidance is in vogue, with the European Central Bank saying last month that its rates will stay low for as long as inflation remains subdued. Faisal Islam, Channel 4's economics editor, has tweeted some links to useful academic papers about the subject:bank Calling all readers in Greece (and anyone heading there this month). Guardian Witness are looking for photos and stories of how the Greek financial crisis is hurting people this summer.

Britain's economy has picked up pace with growth of 0.7% over the last three months, according to the latest prediction from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR's forecast, released at 3pm, shows a small acceleration from the 0.6% officially recorded in the second quarter of 2013 (April-June). The thinktank believes that growth was slightly stronger in the May-July period, adding: These estimates suggest a narrowing of the UK\u2019s large negative output gap. Consumer spending growth has underpinned the recent gains in economic momentum, in spite of the continued decline of real consumer wages. NIESR also updated its graph comparing the last five years to previous recessions and recoveries - it highlights that Britain's economy is still below its pre-crisis peak, almost five years on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers which sparked a global downturn. Europe may feel calm today, but that's just the prelude to another dramatic autumn. Or so claims Mohamed el-Erian, the chief executive of bond-trading giant Pimco, who believes the eurozone crisis is merely on hold this summer, not fixed. He points to the lack of progress on structural reforms, unemployment levels, limited growth in the eurozone (ongoing recessions in many countries, indeed) and signs of slowdown overseas, concluding: Let us hope that European policymakers return well rested from their August break. They will need all the energy and dedication they can muster to pivot quickly from Europe's forced normality to a more durable strategy for recovery, or at least to stop drivers of renewed prosperity from slipping farther away before they can be harnessed. More here:, via Project Syndicate: Eurozone crisis is just on hold for the summer Greece is pinning its hopes on a bumper tourism season this summer, so ministers should be pleased to hear reports that visits to the country are up. Greek newspaper Kathimerini is reporting that the number of tourists arriving in Greece rose by 11.7% in July. Crete's Hania airport was notably busier, with a 14.4% rise in visitors last month. Russian visitors lead the way, apparently: On Zakynthos the rate of arrivals from Russia was up by 147.9% in July compared to last year\u2019s figures, while on Rhodes the figure stood at 57.5%. More here: International travelers flocking to Greece, data shows The Athens government has now cut the VAT levied on food sales, from 23% to just 13%, in a effort to lure tourists to the country and then get them spending in bars and restaurants: Italian government debt has risen in value today, as traders welcomed today's GDP data (which only showed half as large a drop in output as expected). Signs that the political situation is calming down helped to push the country's borrowing costs to their lowest level in two months. The risk of Silvio Berlusconi pulling the plug on Italy's coalition has declined, helping demand for Italian debt, explained Sunrise Brokers strategist Gianluca Ziglio: The political risk has been moved down the road...and that creates a space in which BTPs [Italian bonds] benefit from the relative calm in the market. And the data that has come out from the euro zone in general has been quite positive. And that's knocked 6 basis points off the yield on Italian 10-year bonds, to 4.23%, a level last seen since the first week of June. Deutsche Bank economist Marco Stringa is encouraged by the news that Italian GDP only fell by 0.2% in the last quarter, commenting: Summer data can be volatile and there is political risk in Italy but the picture for the economy still definitely looks more positive than four weeks ago. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, rounds up today's volley of UK economic data: Hopes that Britain has finally emerged from its post-recession doldrums received a triple boost with news of surging factory output, higher car sales and rising activity in the housing market. Fresh signs that the economy may achieve the \"escape velocity\" sought by Mark Carney, the new governor of the Bank of England was provided by data covering industrial output and the two biggest ticket items of consumer spending. The Office for National Statistics said an across the board increase saw manufacturing production grow by 1.9% in June following declines in both April and May. Over the three months to July \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend \u2013 UK factory output was up 0.7%. Industrial production, which includes North Sea oil production and output from the domestic energy sector, was up 0.6% over the same period. Here's the full story: Triple boost for UK economy as data shows signs of recovery Banking expert Frances Coppola is also resisting celebrating June's revival in industrial production. As I flagged up at 12.16pm, we've been here before. She explains: Production is actually significantly below where it was in the same quarter a year ago. The \"good news\" is only an improvement in one month's figures. But in fact it's much worse than that. This chart [see also 9.46am]see the ONS's release shows how far UK industrial production has fallen since the financial crisis More from Frances here: One swallow The other reason to be cautious about the UK economic recovery is that many ordinary households are not yet seeing the benefits. Certainly, that's the message from opposition MPs today, with the Labour party reporting that real wages have been falling for the last 36 months. Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said this morning: David Cameron will go down in history as a disastrous Prime Minister for people\u2019s living standards. He is totally out of touch, his economic policies have failed and the result is working families are massively out of pocket. By 2015, official forecasts show working people will have lost an average of \u00a36,660 under five years of the Tories. Yet millionaires have got a huge tax cut from this Government. Wages aren't keeping pace with UK inflation either. Incomes are rising at around 1% year-on-year, while the consumer prices index rose by 2.9% in June. And the TUC's Duncan Weldon has blogged about how hopes of business investment driving an export-led recovery in Britain have faltered. He writes: What has happened instead is almost three years of stagnation followed by a consumer-led recovery. Consumer spending is rising faster than consumer income with a falling household savings ratio making up the difference. In effect we are seeing a very different kind of recovery to the one the government intended and almost three years later than they expected. More here: Was the Government\u2019s macroeconomic policy right after all? Never the less, chancellor George Osborne must be cheered by signs that growth is picking up, on top of the 0.6% rise in UK GDP in Q2 2013 (which was reported 12 days ago) As I type, over in Westminster Sky News's political correspondent Joey Jones is predicting that autumn could be \"quite tricky\" for Labour leader Ed Miliband... So far today we've seen four separate signals that Britain's economy may be picking up pace. 1) Industrial production rose by 1.1% in June (details at 9.46am) 2) House prices rising 4.6% year-on year (details at 8.50am and over here) 3) Sales figures showing British retailers enjoyed their best July in six years (details here) 4) UK car sales jumped by 12.7% on an annual basis in July, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which is the 17th monthly rise in a row. SMMt also hiked its forecasts for sales in 2013 to 2.216 million units, 8.4% more than in 2012. There are reasons to be cautious, though. As reader Ike Onkker flagged up over Twitter, the industrial production data does not, yet, show a clear upward trend. Here's a reminder of the data, which also shows how the 2010 recovery fizzled out... Looking back at Italy...sovereign bond expert Dr Nick Spiro has warned that the 0.2% drop in GDP reported this morning (10.03am onwards) is a \"salutary reminder' that the eurozone's third-largest economy is suffering a protracted recession. Spiro commented: Italy's economy is no longer in freefall, but it continues to contract, dragged down by a collapse in domestic demand, a severe credit crunch and the adverse effects of a tax-driven fiscal consolidation programme. The best that can be said about Italy's moribund economy is that it is stabilising and showing signs of a recovery of sorts. Quote via fastFT. Bang on cue, ratings agency Fitch has predicted the UK's Help To Buy scheme (providing assistance to home purchaser) will probably mean bigger profit margins for the UK's banks and building firms, push up prices (which are already rising), and could leave the UK government facing \"higher contingent liabilities\". However, it's not clear that Help to Buy will actually lead to more homes being built. As Fitch puts it: For house builders the main benefit from the second phase of the scheme will come from rising house prices, rather than increased volumes. This is because selling a house for more than originally expected has no additional associated costs and therefore generates pure profit, whereas increasing volumes also increases variable costs. Terrific.... More here: UK Help-to-Buy Scheme May Aid Banks, Builders Margins Back in the UK, my colleague Hilary Osborne has written about this morning's rise in house prices (as flagged up at 8.50am) 'Sixth consecutive monthly rise' for house prices Strong data from Germany's factories -- which have reported a 3.8% surge in new orders in June, smashing forecasts of a 1% increase. The figures included a 10% jump in orders within the eurozone, while sales outside of the single currency block rose by just 0.9% during the month. But that doesn't mean the whole German industrial sector had a great month. The German Economy Ministry flagged up that most of the increase was due to sales of expensive items (such as aeroplanes): And orders for consumer durable goods fell by 0.2%, with foreign demand down by 2%. Greece has slipped further into deflation last month, with the latest inflation measure show that prices fell again for the fifth month in a row. The consumer prices index fell by 0.7% on an annual basis in July, following a 0.4% decline in June. Greece's CPI has now been falling since April, when it entered deflation for the first time in 45 years. Greek unemployment is at record levels, wages are being squeezed hard and bank deposits are falling, With citizens struggling to spend, shops must be slashing prices in response. Prices shrank by 1.7% in July compared with June, according to Elstat. Clothing and footware prices shrank by 13% month-on-month, it reported (details here). The euro jumped at 10am BST, on the news that the Italian economy shrank by less than feared in Q2. And here's some early comment via twitter, from the BBC's Gavin Hewitt and political analyst Alberto Nardelli: Italy's economy has suffered some sharp falls in output since the recession began in the summer of 2011.The 0.2% decline in GDP between April in June is the second smallest quarterly decline over the last two years, as this table of GDP on a quarterly basis shows: That's from ISTAT's press release (pdf). Here's Reuters early take on the news that Italy's recession has now lasted for two full years: Italy's economy shrank by less than expected in the second quarter, adding to recent signs that the country's longest post war recession is bottoming out but marking the eighth consecutive quarter of contraction. Gross domestic product fell 0.2% following a 0.6% in the first three months, and dropped 2.0% on an annual basis, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported on Tuesday. A Reuters survey of analysts had pointed to a second quarter fall of 0.4%, down 2.2% annually. ISTAT gave no numerical breakdown of GDP components with its preliminary estimate, saying only that activity had contracted in all the main sectors of activity: industry, services and agriculture.It said so called \"acquired growth\" at the end of the second quarter stood at -1.7 percent. This means that if GDP posts a flat quarterly reading in the final two quarters of 2013, over the whole year it will be down 1.7 percent from the previous year. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that Italian GDP would shrink by 1.8% during 2013. The important question, though, is whether it bounces back in 2014. If today's 0.2% decline means the recession is bottoming out, next year could be a little brighter... BREAKING: The Italian recession has set a new record, but the downturn has eased in the last three months. ISTAT, the Italian statistics body, reported that GDP fell by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2013. That's better than the 0.6% decline which Italy suffered in the first three months of 2013. This means that the Italian economy has shrunk for eight straight quarters, the longest contraction since records began in 1970. Italian GDP is 2.0% lower than a year ago, showing the pain suffered by the country in the last year. Details and reaction to follow Victoria Clarke of Investec says this morning's rise in UK industrial output shows that the recovery may be more 'broad-based' than we thought. She explained (via Reuters): The PMIs in the manufacturing sector have been in expansionary territory since April and what we're seeing today is that that is now coming through to official measures of production which is good news and points towards the UK's recovery being a bit more broad-based - certainly moving away from a recovery that looked to be more services-dominated than anything else. For the Q2 GDP figures it looks as if there's no headline revision so this is more interesting in terms of what it means for broader UK recovery momentum than anything else. Britain's industrial sector posted much stronger growth than expected in June, in the latest sign that the UK economic recovery is gathering pace. Data just released by the Office for National Statistics showed that industrial production rose by 1.1% during June alone, beating forecasts of a 0.6% rise. Manufacturing posted a blockbuster performance, up by 1.9% during the month. On a year-on-year basis, industrial production was 1.2% higher than June 2012, and manufacturing output gained 2%. City economists hailed the news, which comes hot on the heels of the strongest growth in the services sector since the end of 2006. You can see the full data here. Encouragingly, every sector of UK manufacturing posted growth in June - the first time in 21 years. The ONS also reported that production output rose by 0.6% between Q1 2013 and Q2 2013, while manufacturing rose by 0.7%. This graph shows how the long-awaited recovery in the industrial sector may have begun: Proof that Italy's labour market is in a serious mess -- home furnishings store IKEA advertised 200 vacancies in Pisa and received more than 28,000 applications. IKEA was swamped with demand from people keen to work at its new store in Pisa, and is now sifting through the pile of CVs that landed in its HR department. Italy's headline unemployment rate is now 12% - or 39% for young people. As Gai\u00e0 Paradiso, a 25-year-old student, put it: IKEA is a multinational company and can provide work benefits...competition is strong and it is very hard to find something that specifically matches your profile, so everyone applies for the same company. Here's the full story: More than 28,000 Italians apply for 200 Ikea jobs This isn't the first time IKEA has been deluged from applications from willing workers in Southern Europe. In July 2012, it tried to fill 380 vacancies at a new store near Barcelona. More than 55,000 people applied.... Back in the eurozone, and Greece is digesting the surprising news the economic crisis has hit the radio and TV stations owned by the country\u2019s once powerful KKE communist party. After leading the way in protests against austerity measures demanded in return for loans from the EU and IMF, the party has announced it will shut down the broadcaster (as our regular readers flagged up in yesterday afternoon's blog). Here's Helena Smith, our Greece correspondent, with the full story: Even the KKE has had to bow to the inevitable: cost-cutting in the modern age. Taking a leaf out of the hated handbook of its neo-liberal enemies, the communist party has caused shock and awe announcing the sale of its 902 radio and television stations to an, as yet, unnamed private investor. The transfer is expected to be concluded by the end of August. All 48 staff will be laid off with immediate effect. For the remainder of the month, the party-funded channel will play music and cultural shows. \u201cThroughout the four years of the economic crisis the radio-television company, and through their work, employees, \u2026 have applied huge efforts to ensure the station could endure the economic difficulties,\u201d the party said in a rambling press release that acknowledged it would be criticized for the move. \u201cDespite all the efforts and the support of the KKE, the worsening of the station\u2019s economic situation has not been possible to avoid.\u201d What was of utmost importance, it insisted, was \u201cfulfilling the obligations of the station to its workers and insurance funds.\u201d The decision ends two decades of the broadcaster being on air. The nearly 100-year-old daily, Rizospastis, the party\u2019s mouthpiece [motto: \u201cproletarians of the world unite\u201d\u2019] now becomes the KKE\u2019s only official medium although 902 will continue to have a presence on line. The communist party has spearheaded opposition against the \u201cbarbaric measures\u201d meted out by successive governments since the eruption of the euro zone crisis in Athens in late 2009. More than any other political force, the KKE has protested vehemently against public sector job cuts denouncing them, at a time of record unemployment in Greece, as the cruellest of measures so far. Tellingly, it was 902 that rushed to the aid of the state-run channel, ERT, rebroadcasting pirate programs aired by ERT employees when prime minister Antonis Samaras ordered the station to be shut down overnight. In that case, ERT\u2019s nearly 2,700 staff occupied the company\u2019s headquarters in Athens. How workers at 902 will react still remains unclear. Employees were told in no uncertain terms this week that short of accepting a \u201ca haircut\u201d on their salaries (rumoured at around 40%) they would not be able to retain jobs in the party (the majority will be moved on to two other business enterprises owned by the KKE). Support for the communist party, once one of the wealthiest organisations in Greece, has dwindled dramatically since the crisis began. But four years of battling neo-liberal policies have, it seems, also paid off: the comrades in arms have learned how to mimic their enemy well. Just in -- industrial output data from Italy, which shows that factory production rose slightly in June, but remains much weaker than in the summer of 2012. Industrial output rose by 0.3% month-on-month in June, following a 0.1% rise in May. On an unadjusted annual basis, output was more than 5% lower than a year ago - a hefty fall. But if you adjust for differences in working patterns this year, the decline narrows to 2.1%. Analysts had expected a bigger fall, of -3.3% to -3.5%. Italy may be shrinking, but UK house prices are rocketing upwards. Today's Halifax house price survey show that the cost of a home jumped by 4.6% on an annual basis in the three months to July, which is the biggest year-on-year rise since August 2010. Prices picked up by 0.9% in July alone, meaning the average house prices reached \u00a3169,624 in July. Halifax's chief economist Martin Ellis said that recent signs of improvement in the UK economy had boosted consumer confidence, luring more people onto the housing ladder. If you're selling up, you might also like to thank George Osborne for his Help to Buy bubble-inflater scheme. If you're trying to buy.. well, fingers crossed that it works out for you... In the City, bakery chain Greggs has hit shareholders with a profit warning. It appears some shoppers have shunned its delicacies as they basked in the deliciously warm weather instead. Greggs shares are down almost 9% after it cut its earnings forecast for the year, and said: Trading in the first five weeks of the second half to 3 August has been impacted by the heat-wave with like-for-like sales falling by 3.2 per cent compared with the same period last year. It's understandable that demand for sausage rolls and steak slices dipped during a sweltering July. But, as IG's Brenda Kelly reminds me, this is Greggs' second profits warning of 2013 - in April it blamed the snow.... This classic Calvin and Hobbes cartoon may apply..... Encouraging news for Ireland this morning -- its service sector posted its biggest jump in activity in six years. Data released by Markit showed the Irish Services Purchasing Managers Index jumped to 57.6 in July, from 54.9 in June. That shows that growth picked up pace (the PMI is based on interviews with firms across the country). Further evidence that many economies performed well in July -- yesterday's liveblog was peppered with improved PMIs from the UK, the eurozone and the US. Overnight, the Reserve Bank of Australia became the latest central bank to ease monetary policy, by cutting interest rates to 2.5% The quarter-point cut brings headline borrowing costs in Australia down to their lowest in over 50 years. My colleague Greg Jericho covered the action here: Interest rates cut to 2.5% by Reserve Bank - live blog As he pointed out, this still leaves Australian rates much higher than the eurozone or UK, where they're at record lows of 0.5%. The Italian growth (or non-growth) figure are the main eurozone economic event of the morning, in under two hours time. Here's what else is coming up too: \u2022 UK industrial production data for June - 9.30am BST \u2022 Italian GDP data - 10am BST (11am CEST) \u2022 German factory orders for June (11am \u2022 Latest estimate of UK GDP from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research - 3pm BST Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Italy is in focus this morning, with the release of second-quarter GDP figures that will show how its economy fared between April and June. Analysts predict that the Italian economy shrank by 0.4%, which extend its recession into eight quarters. It's already the longest slump since records began in 1970. On a more positive note, that would be an improvement on the 0.6% decline in Q1 2013. The data is released as Italy remains engrossed by the future of Silvio Berlusconi, and the impact his tax fraud conviction, jail term and public office ban will have on the country's coalition government. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets warns, the Silvio Show is a damaging distraction for prime minister Enrico Letta. With a debt to GDP ratio rising to 130% of GDP and unemployment at 12.1%, the Italian economy desperately needs the government to continue its economic reform program, or run the risk of losing being on the receiving end of another ratings downgrade and risking the current stability in the bond markets. Unfortunately Italian PM Letta is not being helped by the media circus surrounding the Berlusconi trial and verdict, which is preventing him from pushing on with a reform program. The fragility of the coalition remains the biggest obstacle to the next steps in this particular economic story. I'll be tracking all the news through the day....",

Photograph: YORGOS KARAHALIS/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Back in the eurozone, and Greece is digesting the surprising news the economic crisis has hit the radio and TV stations owned by the country\u2019s once powerful KKE communist party.</strong></p> <p>After leading the way in protests against austerity measures demanded in return for loans from the EU and IMF, the party has announced it will shut down the broadcaster (as our regular readers flagged up in yesterday afternoon's blog).</p> <p>Here's <strong>Helena Smith</strong>, our Greece correspondent, with the full story:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even the KKE has had to bow to the inevitable: cost-cutting in the modern age. Taking a leaf out of the hated handbook of its neo-liberal enemies, the communist party has caused shock and awe announcing the sale of its 902 radio and television stations to an, as yet, unnamed private investor. The transfer is expected to be concluded by the end of August. All 48 staff will be laid off with immediate effect. For the remainder of the month, the party-funded channel will play music and cultural shows.</p> <p>\u201cThroughout the four years of the economic crisis the radio-television company, and through their work, employees, \u2026 have applied huge efforts to ensure the station could endure the economic difficulties,\u201d the party said in a rambling press release that acknowledged it would be criticized for the move. \u201cDespite all the efforts and the support of the KKE, the worsening of the station\u2019s economic situation has not been possible to avoid.\u201d What was of utmost importance, it insisted, was \u201cfulfilling the obligations of the station to its workers and insurance funds.\u201d</p> <p>The decision ends two decades of the broadcaster being on air. The nearly 100-year-old daily, Rizospastis, the party\u2019s mouthpiece [motto: \u201cproletarians of the world unite\u201d\u2019] now becomes the KKE\u2019s only official medium although 902 will continue to have a presence on line.</p> <p>The communist party has spearheaded opposition against the \u201cbarbaric measures\u201d meted out by successive governments since the eruption of the euro zone crisis in Athens in late 2009. More than any other political force, the KKE has protested vehemently against public sector job cuts denouncing them, at a time of record unemployment in Greece, as the cruellest of measures so far.</p> <p>Tellingly, it was 902 that rushed to the aid of the state-run channel, ERT, rebroadcasting pirate programs aired by ERT employees when prime minister Antonis Samaras ordered the station to be shut down overnight.</p> <p>In that case, ERT\u2019s nearly 2,700 staff occupied the company\u2019s headquarters in Athens. How workers at 902 will react still remains unclear. Employees were told in no uncertain terms this week that short of accepting a \u201ca haircut\u201d on their salaries (rumoured at around 40%) they would not be able to retain jobs in the party (the majority will be moved on to two other business enterprises owned by the KKE).</p> <p>Support for the communist party, once one of the wealthiest organisations in Greece, has dwindled dramatically since the crisis began. But four years of battling neo-liberal policies have, it seems, also paid off: the comrades in arms have learned how to mimic their enemy well.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-06T09:53:58.997Z\">at 10.53am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5200adb7e4b089ae4c3594f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-06T08:09:28.784Z\">9.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Italian industrial production data</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just in -- industrial output data from Italy, which shows that factory production rose slightly in June, but remains much weaker than in the summer of 2012.</strong></p> <p>Industrial output rose by 0.3% month-on-month in June, following a 0.1% rise in May.</p> <p>On an unadjusted annual basis, output was more than 5% lower than a year ago - a hefty fall.

      "body": "<p>August is traditionally Europe's holiday month, with many government officials taking several weeks off. In the process, important initiatives are put on hold until the \"great return\" at the beginning of September.</p> <p>This year, there is another reason why Europe has pressed the pause button for August. With a looming election in Germany, few wish to undermine Chancellor Angela Merkel's likely victory. After all, Germany is central to Europe's wellbeing, and Merkel's steady hand has allowed the continent to overcome a series of challenges over the last few years. As a result, many are eager to postpone any controversial policy decisions rather than rock the German political boat.</p> <p>Some of the recent economic news has seemed to justify this approach. At the end of July, the widely watched indicator of European manufacturing activity crossed the threshold signalling expansion for only the second time in 23 months.</p> <p>Adding to the sense of comforting normality, several European officials have taken to the airwaves with optimistic pronouncements. Whereas the euro and the eurozone were \"under threat just nine months ago\", the European council president, Herman Van Rompuy, recently declared, \"this isn't the case anymore.\"</p> <p>All of this has underpinned a much-welcome calm in financial markets. Sovereign interest-rate spreads have been well-behaved, the euro has strengthened, and equity markets have risen robustly.</p> <p>Yet no one should be fooled. This summer's sense of normality is neither natural nor necessarily tenable in the long term. It is the result of temporary and \u2013 if Europe is not attentive \u2013 potentially reversible factors. If officials do not return quickly to addressing economic challenges in a more comprehensive manner, the current calm may give way to renewed turmoil.</p> <p>The task for Europe is not just a matter of restarting and completing the economic and political initiatives, whether regional or domestic, that have been put on hold until after the German election. In fact, these top-down decisions, while admittedly complex and certainly consequential, may be the least of Europe's challenges.</p> <p>Europe must also counter and reverse micro-level challenges that are becoming more deeply embedded in its economic and financial structure. Each day that passes complicates the design and implementation of lasting solutions to four problems in particular.</p> <p>First, joblessness continues to spread. The overall unemployment rate (12%) has yet to peak, led by an alarming lack of jobs among the young (24% joblessness in the eurozone as a whole, with highs of 59% in Greece and 56% in Spain).</p> <p>Second, adjustment fatigue is widespread and becoming more acute. Long-struggling European citizens \u2013 especially the long-term unemployed \u2013 have yet to gain any sustained benefit from the austerity measures to which they have been subjected. And the result is not just general disappointment and worrisome social unrest. In the last few weeks, political stability in Greece and Portugal has been threatened as governments struggle with declining credibility and a rising popular backlash.</p> <p>Third, bailout fatigue is apparent. Citizens in the stronger European economies are increasingly unwilling to provide financial support to their struggling neighbours; and their elected representatives will find it hard to ignore growing resentment of repeated diversion of national tax revenues, which has yielded only disappointing outcomes. Meanwhile, high levels of past exposure and weakening creditor coordination are undermining the availability of external funding, including from the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>Finally, little oxygen is flowing to the private sector. While Europe has succeeded in stabilising its sovereign-bond markets, financial intermediation for small and medium-size enterprises remains highly disrupted. With most credit pipelines already partly blocked, the shortage of corporate credit will become more severe as regulators finally force banks to embark on a proper mobilisation of prudential capital and shrink balance sheets to less risky levels.</p> <p>All of this adds up to a sad reality for Europe. Despite hopeful blips in an economic indicator here and there, too many countries lack both immediate growth and longer-term growth engines. As a result, debt overhangs will remain problematic. Owners of private capital that could be allocated to productive investment will remain hesitant. And societies will continue to lack the jobs and capital investment that are essential for durable prosperity and general wellbeing.</p> <p>Europe's external environment is not helping, either. On the demand side, the ongoing economic slowdown in China is starting to affect companies' orders and revenues, adding to the challenges stemming from the persistently sluggish US economy. Meanwhile, the euro's recent appreciation (particularly against the Japanese yen) limits Europe's ability to compensate for anaemic global demand by capturing greater market share.</p> <p>These developments point to a much larger phenomenon: because of delayed awareness of the complex challenges (and the related slow and partial policy responses) facing much of the west, the low-equilibrium growth pattern that has prevailed in recent years (what has been called the \"new normal\") is becoming less stable. And Europe is a leading indicator of this.</p> <p>In essence, Europe (and the west more generally) owes its recent tranquillity to a series of experimental measures by central banks to offset the troubling combination of too little demand to generate sufficient job creation, inadequate structural reforms to revamp growth engines, debt overhangs that undermine productive investment and insufficient policy co-ordination. Consequently, the resulting surface calm masks still-worrisome economic and financial fundamentals.</p> <p>Let us hope that European policymakers return well rested from their August break. They will need all the energy and dedication they can muster to pivot quickly from Europe's forced normality to a more durable strategy for recovery, or at least to stop drivers of renewed prosperity from slipping farther away before they can be harnessed.</p>",

As a result, many are eager to postpone any controversial policy decisions rather than rock the German political boat. Some of the recent economic news has seemed to justify this approach. At the end of July, the widely watched indicator of European manufacturing activity crossed the threshold signalling expansion for only the second time in 23 months. Adding to the sense of comforting normality, several European officials have taken to the airwaves with optimistic pronouncements. Whereas the euro and the eurozone were \"under threat just nine months ago\", the European council president, Herman Van Rompuy, recently declared, \"this isn't the case anymore.\" All of this has underpinned a much-welcome calm in financial markets. Sovereign interest-rate spreads have been well-behaved, the euro has strengthened, and equity markets have risen robustly. Yet no one should be fooled. This summer's sense of normality is neither natural nor necessarily tenable in the long term. It is the result of temporary and \u2013 if Europe is not attentive \u2013 potentially reversible factors. If officials do not return quickly to addressing economic challenges in a more comprehensive manner, the current calm may give way to renewed turmoil. The task for Europe is not just a matter of restarting and completing the economic and political initiatives, whether regional or domestic, that have been put on hold until after the German election. In fact, these top-down decisions, while admittedly complex and certainly consequential, may be the least of Europe's challenges. Europe must also counter and reverse micro-level challenges that are becoming more deeply embedded in its economic and financial structure. Each day that passes complicates the design and implementation of lasting solutions to four problems in particular. First, joblessness continues to spread. The overall unemployment rate (12%) has yet to peak, led by an alarming lack of jobs among the young (24% joblessness in the eurozone as a whole, with highs of 59% in Greece and 56% in Spain). Second, adjustment fatigue is widespread and becoming more acute. Long-struggling European citizens \u2013 especially the long-term unemployed \u2013 have yet to gain any sustained benefit from the austerity measures to which they have been subjected. And the result is not just general disappointment and worrisome social unrest. In the last few weeks, political stability in Greece and Portugal has been threatened as governments struggle with declining credibility and a rising popular backlash. Third, bailout fatigue is apparent. Citizens in the stronger European economies are increasingly unwilling to provide financial support to their struggling neighbours; and their elected representatives will find it hard to ignore growing resentment of repeated diversion of national tax revenues, which has yielded only disappointing outcomes. Meanwhile, high levels of past exposure and weakening creditor coordination are undermining the availability of external funding, including from the International Monetary Fund. Finally, little oxygen is flowing to the private sector. While Europe has succeeded in stabilising its sovereign-bond markets, financial intermediation for small and medium-size enterprises remains highly disrupted. With most credit pipelines already partly blocked, the shortage of corporate credit will become more severe as regulators finally force banks to embark on a proper mobilisation of prudential capital and shrink balance sheets to less risky levels. All of this adds up to a sad reality for Europe. Despite hopeful blips in an economic indicator here and there, too many countries lack both immediate growth and longer-term growth engines. As a result, debt overhangs will remain problematic. Owners of private capital that could be allocated to productive investment will remain hesitant. And societies will continue to lack the jobs and capital investment that are essential for durable prosperity and general wellbeing. Europe's external environment is not helping, either. On the demand side, the ongoing economic slowdown in China is starting to affect companies' orders and revenues, adding to the challenges stemming from the persistently sluggish US economy. Meanwhile, the euro's recent appreciation (particularly against the Japanese yen) limits Europe's ability to compensate for anaemic global demand by capturing greater market share. These developments point to a much larger phenomenon: because of delayed awareness of the complex challenges (and the related slow and partial policy responses) facing much of the west, the low-equilibrium growth pattern that has prevailed in recent years (what has been called the \"new normal\") is becoming less stable. And Europe is a leading indicator of this. In essence, Europe (and the west more generally) owes its recent tranquillity to a series of experimental measures by central banks to offset the troubling combination of too little demand to generate sufficient job creation, inadequate structural reforms to revamp growth engines, debt overhangs that undermine productive investment and insufficient policy co-ordination. Consequently, the resulting surface calm masks still-worrisome economic and financial fundamentals. Let us hope that European policymakers return well rested from their August break. They will need all the energy and dedication they can muster to pivot quickly from Europe's forced normality to a more durable strategy for recovery, or at least to stop drivers of renewed prosperity from slipping farther away before they can be harnessed.",

The bank, which is UK based but makes the vast majority of its earnings in Asia, said South Korea continued to be its most difficult market, adding there would be \"no quick fix\". It has been hit by writedowns on bad consumer loans in the country, taken as a result of a government-sponsored scheme to help people out of debt. \"The banking industry as a whole is having an extremely challenging time [in South Korea], given a slowing economy and the impact of multiple policy and regulatory interventions,\" said the bank's chief executive, Peter Sands. Standard Chartered, which bought Korea First Bank in 2005, said it was considering the sale of some of its non-core businesses in the country as well as focusing on reducing costs, simplifying its operating structure and improving the balance sheet. Group pre-tax profit for first half of 2013 fell to $3.32bn from $3.94bn in the same period last year. Sands said the bank was reviewing all options in response to the EU's proposed cap on bankers' bonuses, but would not be drawn on what they might be. HSBC said on Monday it was considering raising salaries to counter the potentially damaging impact a cap might have on its business. The current proposal is to cap bonuses from January at 100% of salary, or 200% with special approval from shareholders. Sands said Standard Chartered's first half performance had been resilient, despite the fall in profits, and that the group benefited from a diverse range of markets and products. He added a flare up of the eurozone crisis and market jitters over a potential easing of monetary stimulus in the US were among the risks to the yearly outlook, but said the bank had started the second half \"with good momentum\". \"Whilst we are clearly not tracking to a double-digit income performance for 2013 \u2013 and will not compromise our standards to achieve this \u2013 we are still expecting to grow our business at a good rate this year, and remain confident in the potential of our strategy and in the growth of our markets,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a bit of a recap: \u2022 As expected the RBA cut the rates to 2.5%, as low as official rates have been since before Elvis joined the Army. \u2022 NAB, Bank of Queensland, Commonwealth Bank have quickly come out and said they will pass on rate in full. This gets mortgage rates down to 43 year lows. \u2022 The RBA\u2019s statement was relatively positive (as positive as a central bank gets when economic growth is below trend). They indicate that there is scope for cutting rate further, but the general sense is we won\u2019t see that happen till November (on Melbourne Cup Day). I shall sign off now. Thanks for everyone for reading and commenting. The Commonwealth Bank has also announced it will pass on the rate cut in full. Treasurer Chris Bowen now speaking: He starts with the John Howard\u2019s old \u201crecord lows\u201d line, and then points out the difference between now and November 2007. For the record - the average mortgage rate was 8.55% (now 5.95%) The average term deposit rate was 6.75% (the last month it was 3.90%). Chris Bowen is now onto standard political argy bargy - cuts to the bone and so forth. The issue with interest rates cuts is that when rates get down to this low, you have to wonder just what impact they will have. Is there really anyone out there who was thinking of buying a house, but was thing, \u201cNah I\u2019ll wait till they get lower than they have been in the past 43 years?\u201d If you weren\u2019t going to buy a house at 6.2%, chances are you probably won\u2019t at 5.95%, so it\u2019s not like this will supercharge the economy. It will however give people more money to save/spend (so long as they don\u2019t like many do, just keep paying the same amount each month). I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much point in going lower, and instead perhaps looking at ways to get banks lowering rates to businesses. The issue of course is not just mortgage rates. The big sticking point has been small business loan and overdraft rates. Currently, the non-secured overdraft rate for small businesses is 9.20%. The rate did go down the full amount with the last rate cut, so here\u2019s hoping banks pass on the full amount to businesses as well. Their rate of 9.20% is not that far below the 10.45% it was in December 2007, despite the cash rate being 4.25 percentage points lower. The problem is the GFC meant banks became much more risk averse - and small businesses are riskier than home loans. This is one of the reason why the drop in the cash rate hasn\u2019t had the same impact on investment in the economy as you would normally expect. It\u2019s pretty clear every bank will pass on the cuts in full. To not do so would be to give their competition a pretty pointless advantage. The ANZ of course waits until Friday to make its decision, so those holding a mortgage with them will have to wait. OK, here\u2019s a bit of a nerdy graph - the average mortgage rates going all the way back to February 1959. The current average rate of 5.95% was beaten for eight months during the GFC in 2009. That was a real emergency period. But outside such an unusual period (and nothing the RBA says in its statement suggests they think we are in an \u201cemergency\u201d) the last time they were this low was March 1970 when they were 5.88% The lowest rates have ever got is 5.0%, all the way back in 1963-64 and in 1959-60. One of the statements Joe Hockey has been making recently about interest rates is that the average of mortgage rates under the Howard government is lower than they have been under the ALP since December 2007. Well the average of mortgage rates under John Howard was 7.26%. With this latest cut (and assuming all other banks follow the NAB and cut by the full 25 basis points), the average rate under the Rudd and Gillard governments is now 7.27%. It might be time to end these silly arguments of who has the lowest interest rates. The market seems to have taken the RBA\u2019s statement as being positive. The dollar \u201cjumped\u201d from US$0.8924 to US$0.8965. So OK, not the biggest of all jumps, but nearly half a cent. Although it is worth bearing in mind that dealers on the foreign exchange market do get a bit jumpy (some serious caffeine intake I think). When the last inflation figures came out, the first reaction on the market was for the dollar to go up, because there was an instant belief they meant the RBA would not cut rates. Clearly that didn\u2019t happen. And now for the RBA\u2019s conclusion: The Board has previously noted that the inflation outlook could provide some scope to ease policy further, should that be required to support demand. At today's meeting, and taking account of recent information on prices and activity, the Board judged that a further decline in the cash rate was appropriate. The Board will continue to assess the outlook and adjust policy as needed to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the inflation target over time. This is pretty neutral - but there does appear to be the suggestion that they could go lower if they were of a mind. Other than briefly during the GFC, the last time mortgage rates were that low was in March 1970. Stephen Koukoulas, the Managing Director of Market Economics, a macroeconomic advisory firm Advisor to Dun &amp; Bradstreet tweets: Now the RBA turns to the housing market and the exchange rate: The easing in monetary policy over the past 18 months has supported interest-sensitive spending and asset values, and further effects can be expected over time. The pace of borrowing has remained relatively subdued, though recently there are signs of increased demand for finance by households. The Australian dollar has depreciated by around 15 per cent since early April, although it remains at a high level. It is possible that the exchange rate will depreciate further over time, which would help to foster a rebalancing of growth in the economy. The only difference between these two paragraphs and what was written in July is that in June the depreciation of the dollar was 10%. The RBA seriously loves using cut and paste. Good comment from below the line. The RBA\u2019s view of the domestic economy is much as it was last month: In Australia, the economy has been growing a bit below trend over the past year. This is expected to continue in the near term as the economy adjusts to lower levels of mining investment. The unemployment rate has edged higher. Recent data confirm that inflation has been consistent with the medium-term target. With growth in labour costs moderating, this is expected to remain the case over the next one to two years, even with the effects of the recent depreciation of the exchange rate. And once again the RBA has failed to note any wages breakout. The lack of wage inflation is one of the biggest failures of those critics of the current Industrial Relations legislation. OK so why did they do it, let\u2019s have a look at the statement by the Governor. Firstly they note: Recent information is consistent with global growth running a bit below average this year, with reasonable prospects of a pick-up next year. Commodity prices have declined but, overall, remain at high levels by historical standards. Inflation has moderated over recent months in a number of countries. A pretty dour start to things but no change really from last time. Indeed most of the statement is word for word the same as last time - even though last time they kept rates steady Well for an average mortgage of $300,000 it\u2019s a saving of around $46 a month, for a mortgage of $400,000 the saving is about $62 a month - if your bank passes on the full cut. They did last time, and there really isn\u2019t a lot of reason why they wouldn\u2019t do so again. Their funding costs haven\u2019t risen significantly, and they have been lowering the rate offered for deposits. The average six month term deposit for deposits over $10,000 has fallen since April from 3.80% to 3.15% And the Reserve Bank has now made it official - the cash rate has been cut by 25 basis points to 2.50%. Righto, here we go... If the RBA does keep rates on hold, it will be very interesting to see how they justify it. The market generally doesn\u2019t like being wrong.. Our interest rates are at record lows, but we\u2019re not alone on that score, and we\u2019re certainly not the lowest. The official Fed rate in the US is 0.13% and it has been at that level since December 2008 (now that really is a sign your economy is struggling). Japan\u2019s official rate is even lower - 0.10%, but this is actually above the 0.05% rate they had for two years until it was raised in April this year. The UK and coincidentally the Euro area have rates at 0.50%, while Canada has rates at 1.0% The Labor Party The problem for the Government is that the economy is certainly not booming. The Economic Statement released last Friday by the Treasurer, predicts the unemployment rate to reach 6.25% in 2014-15. Now mortgage holders might like low interest rates, but they also like having a job, and it\u2019s tough to sell the line that things are going ok, when your own figures predict they will get worse. The reason the RBA can lower rates is because as Treasurer Wayne Swan did actually cut spending. In 2012-13 he cut Government spending from $371 bn in 2011-12 to $367.3 bn. That was the first time in over 40 years that a government has spent less in a year than it did in the previous one. This policy effectively meant the RBA had to do all the heavy lifting to try and stimulate the economy. That we are now likely to hit 2.5% shows just how much lifting they have had to do. That the unemployment rate is predicted to get to 6.25% makes you wonder whether perhaps cutting spending so dramatically was a good way to go about helping the economy. The other problem is that for much of the past five years Mr Hockey has suggested the government's debt and deficit have been putting upward pressure on interest rate. In September 2010, for example, he noted: The likelihood of interest rates rising is back on the agenda, following explicit warnings from the Reserve Bank that it is considering the need for tighter monetary policy. The Coalition has consistently warned that the Labor Government\u2019s heavy borrowing and build up of debt will put upward pressure on interest rates. The RBA did increase rates two months later to 4.75%, but that was as high as they went. Since November 2011 they have only been falling. The Liberal Party now has to reconcile the old line of debt and waste being bad because it leads to higher interest rates with the current one of debt and waste being bad because it leads to interest rates being cut. The Liberal Party Remember when low interest rates were what every political party promised? Now it seems that is no longer such a great thing. The Liberal Party, long-time champions of the \u201cInterest rate will always be lower...\u201d line, now have tried to change the issue to one that suggests interest rate cuts are a sign of a poor economy. This morning on the ABC\u2019s AM, Joe Hockey said And lower interest rates are always good when you have a trend or above trend growth, not falling growth as occurs under Labor. You would want to have rising employment, falling unemployment - not the reverse, which is rising unemployment as is now the case under Labor. The problem for Mr Hockey is that the last time there was an interest rate cut under the Howard Government was December 2001. From that time till November 2007 the cash rate rose from 4.25% to 6.75%. The RBA always keeps a close eye on the state of consumer spending - on retail and housing. Then on Monday, the Retail Sales figures showed retail spending had grown by an anaemic 0.1% in June. As noted here last month, spending on restaurants and take-away food remains the only growth area, while spending in departmental stores and clothing and retails stores has actually declined in the past year. The annual rise of all retail spending of just 2.1% is the lowest since August 2011. This morning the most recent housing price data saw the average of housing price in the capital cities rise 5.1% in the past year. It has been steadily increasing for the past six months, so if the RBA does cut rates today, it is likely to be the last cut for a while. Finally, last week the latest \u201cProducer Price Index\u201d figures, which measure the rise in the cost of good used for production, showed that domestic production prices had grown by a mere 1.5% in the past year. This made it six quarters in a row of less than 2% growth \u2013 the longest such stretch since the ABS began measuring the costs in 1998. So with inflation at the low end, or even below its target band, the RBA has little excuse not to cut rates. First we need to remember the RBA\u2019s job is not just to worry about inflation but also employment and \u201ceconomic prosperity\u201d. And with the unemployment rate at 5.7% the only way the RBA can assist with that aim is to cut rates. But importantly inflation is under control: The CPI figures of last month gave the RBA plenty of room. While the annual price rise of the goods and series bought and sold within Australia (ie not imports) rose to 4.3%, this includes a big jump last year due the introduction of the carbon price, and is expected to fall next quarter. Similarly the overall CPI figure of 2.4% while in the middle of the RBA\u2019s inflation target band of 2%-3% could possibly fall below 2% in the next quarter once the carbon price bounce has washed out. At 2:30 pm today the Reserve Bank is expected to cut the official cash rate from 2.75% to 2.50%. Not only will this be the lowest official interest rate for over 50 years, it will be the first time that interest rates have been cut during an election campaign. In 1990 and 2001 interest rates were cut in the week prior to the election being called \u2013 in the case of the 1990 election it was the day before. To get an idea of just how the state of the economy has changed since 1990, it\u2019s worth remembering that back in February 1990 the official rate was cut from 17.0% to 16.5%. This time the debate is over what the cut means to the economy - Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott suggest it means the Government has lost control of the economy; Kevin Rudd and Chris Bowen meanwhile argue it shows they have the policy setting in place to give the Reserve Bank room to cut rates and ease the cost of living. The market has priced in a rate cut of 25 basis points today as a 100% certainty.",
