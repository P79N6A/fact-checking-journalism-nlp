      "bodyText": "A major oil and gas conference in central London was blockaded by a protest against a top industry award given to the head of ExxonMobil, the oil company that is reported to have funded climate change denial. Protesters blocked the entrance on Tuesday evening by glueing themselves to the doors at the Oil and Money conference at the Dorchester on Park Lane, which brings together the most senior executives in the industry. Signs on their backs read \u201cClimate change is nothing to celebrate\u201d and \u201cYou can ignore the science but you can\u2019t ignore us\u201d. The target of the direct action was Rex Tillerson, recipient of the Petroleum Executive of the Year Award at the conference and the chair and CEO of Exxon, the world\u2019s biggest oil company. Financial records and correspondence emerged in July that show the firm funnelled more than \u00a31.5m to US politicians and lobby groups that deny climate change and block efforts to tackle it \u2013 despite having formerly committed not to. Greenpeace estimates that ExxonMobil have spent almost \u00a320m funding researchers and thinktanks that promote misinformation on climate change. Since the revelations, Exxon has said it acknowledges the risks of climate change and has ceased to fund groups that promote denial. Lorna Buky-Webster, from campaign group Divest London, which organised the protest, said: \u201cWe\u2019re here to show the oil industry that there they have nothing to celebrate. \u201cWhen they should be putting their heads together to tackle the biggest threat to human civilisation that has ever existed, instead they are giving awards to people who have been sitting on knowledge about climate change and aggressively funding denialism.\u201d Tillerson was chosen for the award by industry peers for his \u201chighly successful leadership of ExxonMobil, where he has further enhanced the company\u2019s widely respected reputation for strong operational performance, financial discipline, project execution and technological innovation,\u201d according to Thomas Wallin, vice president of research company Energy Intelligence, which convened the conference in co-operation with the New York Times.",

If you have the chance to issue a trading statement while a bidder is in the wings, normal style says you should throw a punch or two. Shout about your own attractions; remind investors of the wonderful returns they\u2019ve enjoyed for many years; and generally try to massage higher the definition of an attractive offer. SAB\u2019s chief executive, Alan Clark, speaking eight days before Anheuser-Busch InBev must put up or shut up, paid only lip service to the convention. SAB\u2019s organic revenues rose 6% in the second quarter, much better than in the first quarter, but Clark\u2019s commentary was distinctly sober. \u201cWe have a strong business with exceptional long-term prospects \u2026 and an unmatched footprint in the growing beer markets of the world,\u201d he said. All true, but the tone was flat: there was no line, for example, about the bidder timing its move opportunistically as the strong dollar whacks SAB\u2019s actual revenues. A softly-softly approach is understandable, of course, since this is not a typical bid situation. The two shareholders who matter most \u2013 Altria, the cigarette firm with a 27% stake, and the Santo Domingo family from Colombia with 14% \u2013 sit on SAB\u2019s board and are quite capable of forming their own opinion of the company\u2019s worth. If the pair agree to sell to AB InBev, there won\u2019t be a real contest. But it is also true that an independent chairman \u2013 in this case, Jan du Plessis \u2013 should not merely echo the views of his big shareholders. Soon the cards will have to be revealed. If Du Plessis thinks SAB is worth at least \u00a345 a share, he should speak up, even if Altria and the Santo Domingos would be willing to take less. And, frankly, \u00a345 is a low hurdle. Six months ago, SAB\u2019s shares had cleared \u00a337. It\u2019s true that emerging markets have lost some of their fizz since then, but surrendering for a mere 20% top-up on March\u2019s level would be a feeble way for SAB to depart the London market. It\u2019s a tough gig, but it\u2019s time for Du Plessis to display some independent muscle. O\u2019Leary takes fresh swipe at Google Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s unlikely reincarnation as a champion of consumers\u2019 rights is proceeding swimmingly and, in his latest battle with Google, we should cheer for the Ryanair boss. O\u2019Leary argues the US search engine should clamp down on sites that dress up in Ryanair\u2019s clothes in an attempt to hoodwink consumers. He\u2019s right. The current offender is eDreams, an outfit that pays Google to appear at the top of search results. Its masquerade is shameless, down to the colour and design of its website. While it is true that you can book a Ryanair flight through eDreams, it is not the site that 99.9% of people, at a conservative guess, are looking for when they use Google\u2019s service. Ryanair still gets the custom from those who book through eDreams but, inevitably, the punters will end up paying more by involving a third party. Google must know this and yet the company seems happy to tolerate the underhand tactics. Just stop it. Johnson v Sorrell in clash of the titans \u201cThere are some gigantic self-appointed sequoias that pay themselves 780 times the salary of the little shrublets they employ,\u201d declared Boris Johnson in an arresting passage on executive pay in his conference speech. Nice line, but who could he be referring to? It must be WPP\u2019s adman-in-chief Sir Martin Sorrell, where the ratio fits the calculations of the High Pay Centre. Sorrell is also a vocal champion of a third runway at Heathrow, which the London mayor opposes. That may be a coincidence, but probably isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s hope Sorrell returns fire because this personal rivalry promises entertainment.",

While it is true that you can book a Ryanair flight through eDreams, it is not the site that 99.9% of people, at a conservative guess, are looking for when they use Google\u2019s service.</p> <p>Ryanair still gets the custom from those who book through eDreams but, inevitably, the punters will end up paying more by involving a third party. Google must know this and yet the company seems happy to tolerate the underhand tactics. Just stop it.</p> <h2>Johnson v Sorrell in clash of the titans</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d92f88bb494fce2a1046c629f2e2932ad4aed1aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d92f88bb494fce2a1046c629f2e2932ad4aed1aa/0_82_4310_2589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayor of London Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boxing clever: mayor of London Boris Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are some gigantic self-appointed sequoias that pay themselves 780 times the salary of the little shrublets they employ,\u201d declared Boris Johnson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/06/boris-johnson-sir-martin-sorrell-corporate-pay-gap-conservative-conference\">in an arresting passage on executive pay in his conference speech</a>.

The shares closed down 3.7% as the New York Post reported that SABMiller, whose brands include Peroni, Bullmers, Coors and Grolsch, was \u201cleaning towards fighting\u201d the expected offer. Anheuser-Busch Inbev, whose brands include Budweiser, Stella Artois, Corona and Beck\u2019s, has until 14 October to table a formal bid. SABMiller brought forward a trading statement to highlight improved revenue growth as the bid deadline approached. It said trade had picked up in the three months to 30 September as it sold more lager in Africa and Latin America. Revenue minus excise duties and similar taxes rose 6% in the second quarter; growth in the first half of the year had been 4%. However, reported revenue including currency swings fell 9% as currencies in its main markets, such as South Africa, weakened against the US dollar. The world\u2019s second-largest brewer said it published its trading update early to provide information as soon as possible during AB InBev\u2019s offer period. The company said the figures showed it had a strong future with or without a merger, in a move apparently designed to put pressure on the Belgium-based firm. AB InBev proposed paying slightly more than \u00a340 a share for SABMiller last week but was turned down, Bloomberg News reported. SABMiller was reportedly asking for about \u00a345 a share, valuing the company at \u00a373bn and meaning the deal would be the biggest takeover of a UK company. SABMiller declined to comment on Bloomberg\u2019s report. The company announced in September that it had been approached by AB InBev about a takeover to create a company worth about \u00a3180bn that would produce a third of the world\u2019s beer. The 14 October deadline can only be extended if SABMiller asks the takeover panel. SABMiller\u2019s trading statement had been scheduled for the day after the deadline. Alan Clark, SABMiller\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cGrowth accelerated in the second quarter of the year, underpinned by our unmatched footprint in the growing beer markets of the world.

Sales in the 13 weeks to 3 October at Greggs stores open at least a year rose 4.9%, Greggs said in a trading update. Sales growth was slower than the 5.2% rate a year earlier but the baker said it was slightly better than its own forecast. The company, whose fans include the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, said changing products through the day plus its value deals had attracted customers in the third quarter of the year. It also said the chain\u2019s improved own-label drinks with no added sugar were proving popular. Greggs has been refurbishing stores and revamping its products to include healthier options as well as the sausage rolls and other baked goods for which it is best known. It has pushed coffee sales and opened stores early to sell breakfast items such as free-range omelettes and porridge. Additions to the menu for autumn include chicken curry soup and peri peri chicken flatbread. It has launched products for Halloween such as a bat biscuit and a spooky ring bun. The Newcastle-based company said: \u201cMarket conditions remain favourable with low-cost pressures and a stronger consumer environment. We expect this to continue through to the end of the year after which increases to wage rates will drive greater inflationary pressure. \u201cWe expect to deliver good growth for the year, slightly ahead of our previous expectations, and further progress against our strategic plan.\u201d The trading update is the latest positive statement from Greggs, whose shares rose 5% to \u00a311.30. The group is exploiting low inflation for its ingredient costs and rising wages improving consumer confidence. The baker increased its full-year profit guidance for the second time in three months in July. Greggs said it paid its staff more than the current minimum wage of \u00a36.70 an hour for those aged over 21 and that it would stay competitive in the market. The government has announced a new \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 an hour for people aged over 25 from April. Greggs has opened 65 shops this year, including 35 franchises based mainly in \u201ctransport locations\u201d such as petrol station forecourts. It closed 47 shops while refitting 158, giving it 1,668 stores.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our update on the latest developments at Volkswagen, by Graham Ruddick: The new chief executive of Volkswagen has warned the carmaker\u2019s staff that the fallout from the diesel emissions scandal \u201cwon\u2019t be painless\u201d and that the company needs to make \u201cmassive savings\u201d as it faces the prospect of a multibillion-euro bill. Matthias M\u00fcller told a gathering of 20,000 workers at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg that \u201cevery euro that stays in the company helps us\u201d. The comments underline the pressure on VW\u2019s finances for the first time since the carmaker revealed two and a half weeks ago that it had installed defeat devices to cheat official emissions tests. The company has since admitted that it fitted up to 11m vehicles worldwide with the rogue software and has put aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to meet the cost of recalling the cars and fixing them so they meet environmental standards. However, it also faces a fine of up to $18bn (\u00a311.9bn) from US regulators as well as legal claims from customers and shareholders. \u201cIt [the \u20ac6.5bn] includes the estimated cost to fix the affected vehicles. But it won\u2019t be enough,\u201d M\u00fcller said. \u201cWe must prepare for significant penalties, and many could take the events as an opportunity to claim damages against Volkswagen. {Indeed Societe Generale has said the company\u2019s liabilities could total \u20ac32bn.] Here\u2019s our full story: And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Investors have shrugged off the IMF\u2019s latest cut to its global growth forecasts, concentrating instead on the prospect for central banks to continue supporting the global economy and the world\u2019s stock markets. Friday\u2019s poor US jobs numbers continue to convince traders that the Federal Reserve is now less likely to raise interest rates this year. On top of that there are hopes for further stimulus measures from China and the European Central Bank. Meanwhile energy shares have been lifted by a jump in the oil price after the US cut its output forecasts and suggested that production from non-Opec members was stalling. Opec itself said the organisation and non-members should work together to reduce the global oversupply of oil. So Brent crude has climbed 4.5% to $51.5, its highest level since the end of August. As for stock markets, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 27.24 points or 0.43% higher at 6426.16 Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.9% at 9902.83 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.95% better at 4660.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.92% to 22,182.65 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.32% at 10,103.3 In Greece the Athens market was 0.54% higher at 670.69 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently flat, up just 3.5 points. Here\u2019s an interesting chart from the IMF\u2019s world economic outlook, spotted by RBS: A downturn in emerging markets in September led global economic growth lower, according to a new survey. The JPMorgan Global PMI, compiled by Markit, fell from 53.9 in August to 52.8 in September, its weakest for nine months and signalling a rate of worldwide GDP growth of just 2% per annum. Markit said: The divergence between developed and emerging markets widened to the greatest on record over the third quarter. At 49.0 in September, the emerging market PMI fell to its lowest since March 2009, indicating a deterioration in business conditions across manufacturing and services for the third time in the past four months. The developed world PMI meanwhile also fell but, at 54.0 (down from 55.1 in August), remained in expansion territory. The developed world PMI is signalling a 1.5% annual GDP expansion, while the emerging market equivalent is broadly consistent with 3% growth. The emerging market downturn was led by manufacturing, where the PMI has signalled contraction for five successive months, with the rate of decline accelerating in September. However, services also slipped into contraction, suggesting the industrial malaise is spreading to other parts of the emerging market economies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has continued its recent buoyant mood, adding more than 70 points or 0.4% in early trading. European markets, which have been having an uncertain day up until now, are also in positive territory. The FTSE 100 is currently 0.6% higher while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1%. Meanwhile oil continues to climb, with Brent crude now 2.5% better at $50.51 a barrel. Talk that producers might work together to deal with the issue of oversupply had already lifted crude out of the doldrums, and it has now been helped by the US Energy Information Administration forecasting that US crude output would fall between now and mid-2016. The EIA also raised its 2016 forecast for world oil demand by 100,000 barrels a day to 1.41m. Ahead of its annual meeting, the International Monetary Fund has cut its global growth forecasts for 2015: [The IMF] is warning that the weak recovery in the west risks turning into near stagnation after cutting its global economic growth forecast for the fourth successive year. In its half-yearly update on the health of the world economy, the Washington-based fund predicted expansion of 3.1% in 2015, 0.2 points lower than it was expecting three months ago and the weakest performance since the trough of the downturn in 2009. \u201cSix years after the world economy emerged from its broadest and deepest postwar recession, a return to robust and synchronised global expansion remains elusive,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor... The IMF\u2019s world economic outlook (WEO) predicted the US would have the strongest growth of the leading G7 industrial nations in both 2015 and 2016, at 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively. Britain is expected to be the second-fastest growing G7 nation, although output growth is predicted to slow from 2.5% to 2.2%. None of the other G7 countries \u2013 Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada \u2013 is predicted to post growth as high as 2% in either 2015 or 2016. Full story here: And here is Larry\u2019s analysis: Spain was warned about its budget submission after the Eurogroup meeting on Monday, but it appears the warning will not be adopted by the European Commission: Oil prices have reversed their earlier losses, with Brent crude now up 1% at $49.79 a barrel, after Opec said it saw the market improving due to higher demand and a drop in supply from non-members. Oil prices have been under pressure amid falling demand amid weak economic growth, and increased production leading to a supply glut. But Opec\u2019s general secretary Abdullah al-Badri told reporters at an industry conference in London that the market was improving, although it could take two years to rebalance, according to Reuters. Opec has been firm in not cutting production to prop up prices, instead concentrating on protecting its market share. He told the conference there was an overhang of 200m barrels, and Opec members and non-Opec members alike should work together to address the issue. With falling investment from oil companies, he expected prices to rise in the next few months. Russia and Saudi Arabia have already held talks on the oil market last week and plan to continue consulting each other. Global stock markets have been volatile in recent weeks, largely on concerns about a slowdown in China and the knock on effect on commodity prices. But the risks from China are less than many imagine, according to Capital Economics. The research company\u2019s Andrew Kenningham said: Although China\u2019s growth has slowed sharply in recent years, we do not expect a \u201chard landing\u201d. What\u2019s more, even if we turn out to be wrong, some emerging economies would be hit hard by a slump in China, but the impact on advanced economies should generally be modest. GDP growth in China has already slowed from double-digit levels before 2008 to around 5% this year, according to our in-house estimates. However, it has been relatively stable over the past six months, when a slump in its equity market has triggered falls in global asset prices. Looking ahead, we think China will regain some momentum, helped by the policy support now in the pipeline. If China\u2019s economy weakens much further, global growth would also slow. Growth of 2% rather than 6% in China would directly reduce world GDP growth by nearly one percentage point. Along with the knock-on effects elsewhere, global growth could fall from around 31\u20442% to just over 2% for a year or two. Industrial metal producers such as Australia and Chile could be hard hit. But the impact on the major advanced economies, including the US and euro-zone, would be much smaller. Finally, there would be some offsetting advantages for the rest of the world from slower growth in China. Most importantly, although any further fall in commodity prices would hurt commodity producers, it should be a net positive for the world as a whole. Overall, therefore, while a slump in China would clearly dampen global growth, it would not be the catastrophe that many fear. The European parliament has approved plans to speed up a \u20ac35bn funding programme for Greece earmarked in the EU\u2019s 2014-2020 budget. Commenting on today\u2019s vote in favour, the European Commission said: The aim is to allow Greece to make full use of EU funds and inject liquidity into the Greek economy. Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president for the euro and social dialogue, said: I welcome today\u2019s vote in the European Parliament giving its green light to frontloading existing EU funds for investment in growth-enhancing projects in Greece.... It should be seen in a wider context of the reform process undertaken in Greece. Timely and effective implementation of reforms to modernise Greek public administration and the economy \u2013 as agreed under the new stability support programme \u2013 is crucial to regain financial stability and, consequently, ensure economic growth and job creation. America\u2019s trade gap has hit a five-month high, in another sign that global economic growth may be weakening. US imports rose by 1.2% in August, fuelled by a 3% increased in purchases from China. But exports shrank by 2%, to their lowest point since October 2012. That indicates weakness in key markets such as emerging nations and Europe. It could also reflect the impact of the stronger US dollar, which has gained against other currencies. This drove the US Trade Deficit up to $48.33bn in August, up from $41.81bn a year ago. The VW scandal hasn\u2019t hurt the UK auto industry yet - car sales hit an all-time high in September, according to new data today. Petrol-powered cars saw the strongest demand; suggesting some consumers might be more wary about diesel now. Workers at Volkswagen have been warned to expect painful changes as the German carmaker tackles the emissions scandal. New CEO Matthias M\u00fcller told staff that non-essential investments will be delayed or abandoned as it wrestles with the crisis. M\u00fcller told today\u2019s meeting in Wolfsburg that: \u201cTechnical solutions to the problems are within view. However, the business and financial consequences are not yet clear\u201d. \u201cTherefore we are putting all planned investments under review. What is not urgently needed will be scrapped or delayed\u201d. \u201cAnd therefore we will adjust our efficiency programme. I will be very open: this won\u2019t be painless.\u201d Muller\u2019s warning came after works council boss Bernd Osterloh predicted that bonus payments to workers are now at risk too. Our Katie Allen confirms that Britain\u2019s directors do not march on an empty stomach, or an environmentally friendly one.... Update: IoD delegates have now plonked themselves outside in the sun -- making a nice photo for visiting tourists. Delegates at the Institute of Directors\u2019 conference are tucking into their legendary lunchboxes -- a chance to refuel after a morning discussing weighty topics like Europe and migration. There\u2019s an astonishing amount of packaging on display too -- here\u2019s a photo of just one box: Perhaps Britain\u2019s new tax on plastic bags should be extended? \u00a310 per plastic lid might cover it.... Here\u2019s a couple of photos of Volkswagen staff arriving in Wolfsburg, where they were briefed on the emissions crisis today: Brewing firm SABMiller has turned down an \u2018informal offer\u2019 from rival Anheuser-Busch InBev, according to a Bloomberg newsflash. That\u2019s sent SAB\u2019s shares down 3%, to the bottom of the FTSE 100 (budge up, Glencore!). This come three weeks after AB INBev, which brews Stella Artois and Budweiser, approached SAB, whose brands including Grolsch and Peroni. Any deal would be huge, creating a new company worth perhaps $250bn (\u00a3160bn). AB InBev has just a week to make a firm bid or walk away, so it\u2019s not Last Orders in this story, yet. The works council boss at Volkswagen, Bernd Osterloh, has told staff that the company will have to review all its investments following the emissions crisis. He also predicted that their pay packets will suffer too. Osterloh gave the warning at today\u2019s staff meeting in Wolfsburg (see earlier post) Reuters has the story: All investments at Volkswagen will be placed under review, the carmaker\u2019s top labour representative said on Tuesday, as the embattled German group grapples with the fallout of its diesel emissions scandal. \u201cWe will need to call into question with great resolve everything that is not economical,\u201d Bernd Osterloh, head of VW\u2019s works council told more than 20,000 workers at a staff gathering in Wolfsburg, Germany. The scandal is not yet having consequences for jobs at VW, which employs 60,000 people at its main factory, but will impact earnings at the core autos division as well as bonus payments to workers, Osterloh said. Volkswagen has revealed that it sold eight million cars with defective emissions testing software across Europe. It made the admission in a letter to German MPs, dated last Friday. That\u2019s the bulk of the 11 million cars affected, including almost 500,000 in the US. We already know that 1.2m cars sold in the UK contained software to beat emission tests, plus 2.8m in Germany. Looks like Lord Lawson got the last blow in: They\u2019re still arguing... Back at the IoD conference, Nigel Lawson and Peter Mandelson are having a brisk exchange of views over Britain\u2019s membership of the EU (Lord M is pro, Lord L is con). Katie Allen is impartial, and tweeting the key points from the Albert Hall: Mining shares are leading the fallers in London this morning. The 1.8% drop in German factory orders in August isn\u2019t helping the mood. Investors are concerned that falling demand from emerging markets could increase the raw materials glut, which has already driven commodity price down to multi-year lows. The Institute of Directors\u2019 chief is also rebuking UK politicians for playing the migrants card: Over at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, business leaders are gathering for the annual Institute of Directors convention. The 2,000 or so delegates will be hearing first from IoD head Simon Walker. As we reported this morning, Walker will use his speech to warn prime minister David Cameron that waiting till 2017 to hold the referendum on EU membership risks turning it into a confidence vote in the government. He wants the referendum brought forward to 2016. Walker will tell the audience that: \u201cBy 2017 this government will have implemented spending cuts that, while necessary, will not be popular. The third year of an election cycle is a difficult time for any administration. There is a real possibility that a 2017 referendum would be a short-term judgment on the government: a chance to whack the political elite.\u201d Next up, just after 10am is a debate on Britain\u2019s EU membership between former Labour business secretary Lord Mandelson and former chancellor Lord Lawson, who last week announced he will lead a Conservative party campaign to leave the EU. Also making an appearance, is chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, Antonio Horta-Osorio, just a day after chancellor George Osborne announced the sale of the taxpayers\u2019 remaining stake in the bailed out bank. The bank boss is talking on a panel under the banner \u201cThe future of banking: How to win back trust in a changing world.\u201d Alongside its trailing of Walker\u2019s EU referendum thoughts, the IoD is also using its convention to adds its thoughts to the never-ending UK productivity puzzle debate. Policymakers are looking at the puzzle all wrong, according to the business group\u2019s new report, Balancing UK Productivity and Agility. It wants more focus on \u201cagility\u201d to ensure \u201cnew ideas and technologies spread throughout the economy as quickly as possible\u201d. It warns factors that have driven productivity gains in the past, such as large firms realising economies of scale and developing deep specialisations in certain areas, are no longer relevant for the UK and \u201cit would be foolish to try to recreate them\u201d. IoD chief economist James Sproule explains: \u201cIn pursuing the nirvana of steadily-rising productivity, one has to bear in mind how our economy is changing, how people choose to work, and what future economic success will look like. We need to ask if too close a focus on productivity numbers without considering wider factors could pose a long-term risk to the economy and prosperity.\u201d His report echoes scepticism over how much can be gleaned from current productivity data and what many economists see as a narrow focus on mere output per hour measures. Back in the UK, house prices dipped by 0.9% last month, according to mortgage lender Halifax. But that\u2019s little relief to those hoping to get a house (or buy a bigger one. Prices are up around 8.9% year-on-year. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, they\u2019ve been gaining since the start of 2013. Interesting.... Jonathan Portes, one of the UK\u2019s better known economists, has left his post as director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank. There doesn\u2019t appear to be an official announcement, but NIESR has updated its website to show that Dame Frances Cairncross is now \u2018interim director\u2019. Portes (who\u2019s staying at NIESR as a research fellow until April) is known for using his statistical nous to fact-checking erroneous claims in the papers, especially over the impact of fiscal policy on poorer households. But he also raised hackles among right wingers for his comments on austerity; they claimed loudly that Portes (once PM Gordon Brown\u2019s chief economist) was too partisan for an independent thinktank: Those spats culminated in an epic row with historian Niall Ferguson over an article in the Financial Times, which spawned an 16-page adjudication - and no clear winner (although the FT cleared itself of any failings, of course) Over in Wolfsburg, thousands of Volkswagen employees are meeting at company HQ to hear from their new CEO. Matthias M\u00fcller will brief staff on the ongoing emissions scandal, as Volkswagen strives to find a solution after selling millions of vehicles containing \u2018defeat devices\u2019 to fool emissions tests. M\u00fcller was appointed as CEO less than two weeks ago, after Martin Winterkorn stepped down following the revelations that VW engines contained illicit software to hide how much noxious gases they produced. It emerged last night that the probe into the VW scandal centres on two top engineers. Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi\u2019s chief engineer, and Wolfgang Hatz, developer of Porsche\u2019s Formula One and Le Mans racing engines, were among the engineers suspended last week, according to the WSJ. European stock markets are being dragged down by the news that German factory orders slid in August. The main indices are all in the red in early trading, with Germany\u2019s DAX shedding almost 0.5%. Investors may also be anxious about the eurozone, after Brussels warned Spain last night that i\u2019s 2016 budget isn\u2019t good enough, and needs more spending cuts. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: A huge miss in German factory orders (complete with a downward revision for last month\u2019s figure) seems to have taken the edge off of the Eurozone, following a Eurogroup meeting yesterday that hinted at more trouble for the currency union going forwards. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici warned that Spain will miss its headline targets in 2015 and 2016, providing yet another bearish note from the country that already includes a 21 month low manufacturing figure, a 9 month low services PMI, a separatist victory in Catalonia AND an impending general election in September. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s early take on the decline in German factory orders: German factory orders dropped for the second consecutive month in August, led by a drop in demand from countries outside the eurozone and lower demand at home. The Economy Ministry said Tuesday that orders were down 1.8% in seasonally adjusted terms compared with the previous month. That followed a 2.2% drop in July. Orders from other countries in the euro area were up 2.5%, following a smaller gain in July. However, demand from inside Germany was off 2.6% percent and orders from outside the eurozone dropped 3.7%. The Economy Ministry noted that demand from countries beyond the euro area appears to be \u201cless reliable at present.\u201d Germany has Europe\u2019s biggest economy and is one of the world\u2019s biggest exporters. This chart confirms that German industrial orders have tailed off in the last couple of months, after a decent start to the year. The red line shows the total (or Insgesamt), while the blue line shows domestic orders (Inland) and the yellow line shows overseas orders (Ausland). German factory orders fell unexpectedly in August, fuelling fears that Europe\u2019s largest economy is being hit by slowing global growth. Industrial orders slid by 1.8%, according to the economy ministry, dashing expectations of a 0.5% rise. The decline was mainly due to falling demand from outside the eurozone, according to the ministry (which also attribute some of the decline to holidays). Orders from non-euro countries slid by 3.7%, while domestic orders shrank by 2.6%. This is before the Volkswagen emissions scandal struck, hurting confidence in German industry. July\u2019s industrial orders has been revised down too, from -1.4% to -2.2%; again, driven by a decline in overseas demand. It\u2019s a worrying sign, suggesting ripples from the emerging market slowdown are now lapping against the eurozone. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a relaxed mood in the markets this morning, as investors become increasingly convinced that central banks won\u2019t be able to tighten monetary policy anytime soon. European stock markets are expected to inch higher after the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 304 points overnight. Last Friday\u2019s disappointing US jobs report has probably helped to kick the first American interest rate rise into 2016. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The weaker than expected US jobs report significantly reduces the chance of a rate hike this year from the Federal Reserve. Europe and China could also be on the verge of adding stimulus with deflation and low growth possibly enough motivation for the respective central banks to intervene before the end of 2015. Over in Japan, the Nikkei has closed 1% higher, as traders in Tokyo anticipate more stimulus from their own central bank. Also coming up.... The bosses of Britain\u2019s top companies will be gathering at the Institute of Director\u2019s annual bash in London. They\u2019ll be discussing Europe and the refugee crisis (among other topics). Six former City brokers are going on trial over allegation that they rigged the benchmark Libor interest rate. And in the City, we\u2019ll be looking at results from budget airline easyJet and pastry purveyor Greggs.....",

But the risks from China are less than many imagine</strong>, according to Capital Economics. The research company\u2019s Andrew Kenningham said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Although China\u2019s growth has slowed sharply in recent years, we do not expect a \u201chard landing\u201d. What\u2019s more, even if we turn out to be wrong, some emerging economies would be hit hard by a slump in China, but the impact on advanced economies should generally be modest.</p> <p>GDP growth in China has already slowed from double-digit levels before 2008 to around 5% this year, according to our in-house estimates. However, it has been relatively stable over the past six months, when a slump in its equity market has triggered falls in global asset prices. Looking ahead, we think China will regain some momentum, helped by the policy support now in the pipeline.</p> <p>If China\u2019s economy weakens much further, global growth would also slow. Growth of 2% rather than 6% in China would directly reduce world GDP growth by nearly one percentage point. Along with the knock-on effects elsewhere, global growth could fall from around 31\u20442% to just over 2% for a year or two. Industrial metal producers such as Australia and Chile could be hard hit. But the impact on the major advanced economies, including the US and euro-zone, would be much smaller.</p> <p>Finally, there would be some offsetting advantages for the rest of the world from slower growth in China. Most importantly, although any further fall in commodity prices would hurt commodity producers, it should be a net positive for the world as a whole. Overall, therefore, while a slump in China would clearly dampen global growth, it would not be the catastrophe that many fear.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20bbea815dd402f1f682bc840259c51d430e7975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20bbea815dd402f1f682bc840259c51d430e7975/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"China\u2019s economy has been slowing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China\u2019s economy has been slowing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Woo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5613c3a4e4b00c8af064d153\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-06T12:58:37.689Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The European parliament has <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20151002IPR95316/html/Greece-Parliament-backs-urgent-frontloading-of-%E2%82%AC35-billion-in-EU-funding\">approved plans to speed up a \u20ac35bn funding programme for Greece</a> earmarked in the EU\u2019s 2014-2020 budget.</strong></p> <p>Commenting on today\u2019s vote in favour, the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-15-5779_en.htm\"><strong>European Commission said</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The aim is to allow Greece to make full use of EU funds and inject liquidity into the Greek economy. </p> </blockquote> <p>Valdis Dombrovskis, vice-president for the euro and social dialogue, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>I welcome today\u2019s vote in the European Parliament giving its green light to frontloading existing EU funds for investment in growth-enhancing projects in Greece....

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has called on Google to take action to protect customers from booking flights with the airline at inflated prices on websites that it claims are masquerading as its own. In a turn of events that would have appeared unlikely a few years back, the no-frills carrier will champion consumers over what it believes is misleading advertising on Google. Ryanair says screenscraper websites, in particular eDreams, are duping customers into booking flights through them by paying Google to appear at the top of its Ryanair searches, and using a URL that includes the name Ryanair. The eDreams website livery, in blue two-tone, can be said to resemble the airline\u2019s official site. Customers are offered lower fares than are available on Ryanair, although customer service and booking fees eventually inflate the price above that offered by Ryanair. Furthermore, as the airline does not hold the booking details, it cannot reach the passengers to inform them of disruption or prompt them to check in online. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, called on Google to change its practices. He said: \u201cCustomers end up paying more and with complications down the line, it\u2019s overall a bad experience, and we think Google can do better than that. \u201cWe get the booking, so it\u2019s not materially damaging our business, but it is causing our customers problems. This will have to come to an end. Ryanair used to be the bad guys. But while Google are taking money from them for advertising, Google has a responsibility. They talk the talk on trust and transparency but now\u2019s the time to walk the walk.\u201d The airline has had several legal tussles with screenscraper websites across Europe. A German court recently ruled that eDreams should desist from using a subdomain that implied it had an official partnership with Ryanair. Jacobs said the \u201clookalike URL and branding\u201d was misleading and customers would normally end up paying at least \u20ac13-\u20ac20 (\u00a310-\u00a315) more than the originally advertised fare once charges and fees were added. Ryanair is not the only airline to have complained about eDreams. In 2013, easyJet reported the site to the Office of Fair Trading, the UK Civil Aviation Authority and the consumer group Which? for breaching consumer laws, claiming that up to a million people had paid over the odds for its fares. Based in Spain, eDreams is an online travel company that bought out Opodo and Go Voyages before floating in 2013. A spokesperson for eDreams said it was entitled to sell Ryanair tickets and to use Google\u2019s AdWords to promote its flight booking services, adding: \u201cRyanair has been trying, without success, to prevent online travel agencies selling its tickets for the last ten years, and they are now invoking new, ill-founded grievances.\u201d Google had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.",

The eDreams website livery, in blue two-tone, can be said to resemble the airline\u2019s official site. </p> <p>Customers are offered lower fares than are available on Ryanair, although customer service and booking fees eventually inflate the price above that offered by Ryanair. Furthermore, as the airline does not hold the booking details, it cannot reach the passengers to inform them of disruption or prompt them to check in online.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/30/ryanair-being-nice-fewer-rules-less-hassle-more-profit\">Fewer rules, less hassle, more profit \u2013 how being nice paid off at Ryanair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, called on Google to change its practices.

This will have to come to an end. Ryanair used to be the bad guys. But while Google are taking money from them for advertising, Google has a responsibility. They talk the talk on trust and transparency but now\u2019s the time to walk the walk.\u201d</p> <p>The airline has had several <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/27/ryanair-takes-aim-at-price-comparison-websites\">legal tussles with screenscraper websites</a> across Europe. A German court recently ruled that eDreams should desist from using a subdomain that implied it had an official partnership with Ryanair.</p> <p>Jacobs said the \u201clookalike URL and branding\u201d was misleading and customers would normally end up paying at least \u20ac13-\u20ac20 (\u00a310-\u00a315) more than the originally advertised fare once charges and fees were added. </p> <p>Ryanair is not the only airline to have complained about eDreams.

      "bodyText": "Private industry was in a rage while privacy groups were elated on Tuesday over a new ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) affirming European citizens\u2019 right to privacy from American tech companies. On Tuesday, the European court ruled in favor of Max Schrems, an Austrian graduate student who asked that EU\u2019s data protection commissioner bar Facebook from transmitting his personal data to the US on the grounds that many tech firms had cooperated with the National Security Agency. Transmission of personal data had previously been covered by a \u201csafe harbor\u201d agreement between Europe and the US that allowed tech firms to share the data with explicit consent from their customers. Businesses that operate in Europe must now make sure they are compliant with the EU\u2019s own laws before they subject their customers\u2019 personal information to laxer restrictions in the US, the court said. The advertising industry was not pleased. \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the European Court of Justice jeopardizes thousands of businesses across the Atlantic,\u201d said Mike Zaneis, executive vice-president of public policy and general counsel for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, who called the overturned provision \u201can efficient means to comply with EU privacy law\u201d. \u201cThe weakening of the Safe Harbor agreement limits European consumers\u2019 access to valuable digital services and impedes trade and innovation,\u201d said Zaneis. \u201cWe urge the US and EU to agree on new rules for the transatlantic transfer of data, taking into account the CJEU\u2019s judgment.\u201d Evan Greer, campaign director for internet activist group Fight for the Future, said: \u201cThe ECJ has confirmed what the vast majority of internet users already know: large US-based tech companies have been deeply complicit in mass government surveillance, and have traded their users\u2019 most basic rights for a cozy relationship with the US government. While the discussion around NSA spying has far too often focused only on the rights of US citizens, the ECJ ruling is a reminder that freedom from indiscriminate surveillance is a basic human right that should be protected for everyone, regardless of where they live.\u201d Tech giants such as Facebook, Apple and Google have long planned for a loss and are likely to fall back on their own user agreements to allow them to transmit data overseas or use their own legal status within Europe to circumnavigate the ruling. \u201cFacebook, like many thousands of European companies, relies on a number of the methods prescribed by EU law to legally transfer data to the US from Europe, aside from Safe Harbor. \u201cIt is imperative that EU and US governments ensure that they continue to provide reliable methods for lawful data transfers and resolve any issues relating to national security,\u201d said a Facebook spokesperson. The judgement is likely to be \u201cgood news for lawyers\u201d for years to come, said one tech executive, and likely to disproportionately hit smaller tech companies. James Kinsella, a former Microsoft exec who runs European privacy law compliance company Zettabox, said flatly that the new regulation would not stifle trade. \u201cIt will require that companies doing business in Europe understand where they are putting their customers\u2019 data. To say it will stifle is like saying, \u2018requiring seatbelts in cars stifled car sales.\u2019 No, it didn\u2019t. It made cars safe; it made auto travel a more reliable form of transportation. It made the car an even more desirable and dependable form of transportation. So, too, with cloud services. At the moment, companies are putting their \u2018passengers/customers\u2019 data in the back seat without a seat belt.\u201d Kinsella also saw at least one area of industry that would benefit immediately from the ruling: European cloud storage. \u201cIt will help boost the cloud services business here, in Europe, which will be a good thing for everyone, because it will generate more competition and require that all providers consider new rules (like the GDPR) that will make ALL data safer for everyone.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The new chief executive of Volkswagen has warned the carmaker\u2019s staff that the fallout from the diesel emissions scandal \u201cwon\u2019t be painless\u201d and that the company needs to make \u201cmassive savings\u201d as it faces the prospect of a multibillion-euro bill. Matthias M\u00fcller told a gathering of 20,000 workers at VW\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg that \u201cevery euro that stays in the company helps us\u201d. The comments underline the pressure on VW\u2019s finances for the first time since the carmaker revealed two and a half weeks ago that it had installed defeat devices to cheat official emissions tests. The company has since admitted that it fitted up to 11m vehicles worldwide with the rogue software and has put aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to meet the cost of recalling the cars and fixing them so they meet environmental standards. However, it also faces a fine of up to $18bn (\u00a311.9bn) from US regulators as well as legal claims from customers and shareholders. \u201cIt [the \u20ac6.5bn] includes the estimated cost to fix the affected vehicles. But it won\u2019t be enough,\u201d M\u00fcller said. \u201cWe must prepare for significant penalties, and many could take the events as an opportunity to claim damages against Volkswagen. \u201cThat is why we have initiated a further critical review of all planned investments. Anything that is not absolutely necessary will be cancelled or postponed, and it is why we will be intensifying the efficiency programme. To be perfectly frank: this will not be a painless process.\u201d M\u00fcller refused to rule out the prospect of job cuts at VW, which employs 600,000 staff. \u201cAs for jobs at Volkswagen: we still do not know today what impact the crisis will have,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will fight to keep it as small as possible, and we will do everything in order to keep employees in the company. \u201cWe must make massive savings to manage the consequences of this crisis. At the same time, though, we cannot afford to economise on the future.\u201d M\u00fcller said the commercial and financial consequences were \u201cnot yet foreseeable\u201d but added: \u201cOne thing is certain: the burden will be big. Potentially very big.\u201d VW has been set a deadline of Wednesday by German authorities to outline its plan to fix the 11m affected vehicles. The company has already set up websites where motorists can check if their vehicle needs to be recalled. Bernd Osterloh, head of VW\u2019s works council and a key member of the supervisory board, told workers that the carmaker had to face the crisis with \u201cgreat resolve\u201d. He said: \u201cWe will need to call into question with great resolve everything that is not economical.\u201d Shares in the company have fallen by 40% since the crisis began, wiping \u20ac30bn off the value of VW, the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of cars and commercial vehicles. However, M\u00fcller insisted that VW can recover from the scandal. \u201cWe can and we will overcome this crisis, because Volkswagen is a group with a strong foundation, and above all because we have the best automobile team anyone could wish for,\u201d he said. \u201cOur most important task will therefore be to win back the trust we have lost \u2013 with our customers, partners, investors and the general public.\u201d New figures from the UK, where almost 1.2m vehicles are affected, suggest that the crisis has not yet hurt sales of VW or diesel cars. New car registrations in September rose by 8.6% year-on-year, with sale of VW cars up 4% and Audi, which is owned by VW, up 11%. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: \u201cIt is too early to draw conclusions [from the VW scandal], but customer demand for diesel remained strong, accounting for one in two cars registered.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund is warning that the weak recovery in the west risks turning into near stagnation after cutting its global economic growth forecast for the fourth successive year. In its half-yearly update on the health of the world economy, the Washington-based fund predicted expansion of 3.1% in 2015, 0.2 points lower than it was expecting three months ago and the weakest performance since the trough of the downturn in 2009. \u201cSix years after the world economy emerged from its broadest and deepest postwar recession, a return to robust and synchronised global expansion remains elusive,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor. \u201cDespite considerable differences in country-specific outlooks, the new forecasts mark down expected near-term growth rates marginally, but nearly across the board. Moreover, downside risks to the world economy appear more pronounced than they did just a few months ago.\u201d The IMF\u2019s world economic outlook (WEO) predicted the US would have the strongest growth of the leading G7 industrial nations in both 2015 and 2016, at 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively. Britain is expected to be the second-fastest growing G7 nation, although output growth is predicted to slow from 2.5% to 2.2%. None of the other G7 countries \u2013 Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada \u2013 is predicted to post growth as high as 2% in either 2015 or 2016. \u201cRecovery is most advanced in the US and the UK, where monetary policy looks likely to tighten soon, but is more tentative in the euro area and Japan,\u201d Obstfeld said. The WEO accepted that the IMF has been consistently over-optimistic in its predictions for the global economy. \u201cGrowth has fallen short of forecasts over the past four years,\u201d it said, noting that on average the IMF had over-estimated expansion by one percentage point a year. \u201cThe main medium-term risk for advanced economies is a further decline of already-low growth into near stagnation, particularly if global demand falters further as prospects weaken for emerging market and developing economies,\u201d the WEO said. \u201cIn this context, persistently below-target inflation could become more entrenched.\u201d Growth in the advanced countries of the west is forecast to pick up slightly, from 1.8% in 2014 to 2% in 2015. But this has been more than offset by a slowdown in the rest of the world, where growth is expected to fall from 4.6% to 4%. \u201cGlobal growth remains moderate \u2013 and once again more so than predicted a few months ago.\u201d The IMF said the stronger advanced economies \u2013 the US and the UK \u2013 were likely to be the first to raise interest rates, with the first increase predicted in late 2015 for the US and in 2016 for the UK. \u201cThe process of normalising monetary policy in the United States and the United Kingdom is assumed to proceed smoothly, without large and protracted increases in financial market volatility or sharp movements in long-term interest rates.\u201d Following the share price falls in financial markets in August, the IMF said it was important that emerging market countries were prepared for a rise in US borrowing costs. Leading western countries that still had spare capacity following the recession of 2008-09 should continue to provide stimulus, through a combination of ultra-low interest rates, the money creation process known as quantitative easing, and public spending on capital projects. It said that \u201cthe case for infrastructure investment seems compelling at a time of very low long-term interest rates. Investment is one way to enhance potential growth, but targeted structural reforms can also play an important positive role.\u201d Emerging market economies such as China were the main source of growth in the immediate aftermath of the 2008-09 slump, but the IMF said the outlook was weakening, with growth projected to decline from 4.6% in 2014 to 4% in 2015 \u2013 the fifth annual decline in a row. China\u2019s growth is expected to match earlier IMF forecasts but recessions in Brazil and Russia are now on course to be worse than previously estimated. The WEO listed a number of potential risks \u2013 financial market turmoil; lower potential output; a hard landing in China; the impact of lower commodity prices on commodity-exporting nations; a strengthening of the US dollar; geo-political unrest; and secular stagnation. \u201cThe distribution of risks to global growth remains tilted to the downside,\u201d it said. Oil prices are projected to increase gradually, from an average of $52 a barrel in 2015 to about $55 a barrel in 2017. In contrast, non-fuel commodity prices are expected to stabilise at lower levels after recent declines in both food and metal prices.\u201d Lower oil prices are expected to result in inflation in advanced countries declining from 1.4% in 2014 to 0.3% in 2015.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund is worried. That\u2019s not just because it has shaved its growth forecast for 2015 for the second time in six months. It is not even that the world economy is expected this year to post its weakest performance since it completely stalled in 2009. Rather, it is because the global economy continues to under-perform. Every year, economists at the fund predict that recovery is about to move up a gear, and every year they are disappointed. The IMF has over-estimated global growth by one percentage point a year on average for the past four years. That\u2019s a chunky forecasting error, especially in the light of all the factors that should have been boosting activity \u2013 interest rates at all-but zero, oodles of money creation through quantitative easing programmes and, more recently, tumbling oil prices. As a result, the fund is now doing some head-scratching in order to determine whether this persistently weaker than predicted performance is a temporary phenomenon caused by a particularly deep recession or something more permanent. It starts by analysing the factors that might be causing slower growth. The recent sluggish productivity record suggests that long-run potential output growth \u2013 the rate at which economies expand over many decades \u2013 has slowed. Persistently low investment helps explains why labour productivity and wage growth have been so modest. The fund\u2019s world economic outlook states: \u201cLow aggregate demand is one factor that discourages investment. Slow expected potential growth itself dampens demand, further limiting investment, in a vicious circle. Ageing populations further restrain investment in a number of countries; in some others, institutional shortcomings or political instability are deterrents.\u201d This, though, doesn\u2019t really get to the bottom of whether the slowdown is permanent or not. Some economists, such as the former US Treasury secretary, Larry Summers, think that it is and warn that advanced economies are heading for what he calls \u201csecular stagnation\u201d. Others think the damage caused to the financial system by the crisis means it will take longer than usual for economies to return to their long-term trend. This debate is explored by the fund. \u201cSome economic historians advance the idea that the postwar global growth experience largely reflects diminishing returns along the extensive margin of technological innovation, punctuated temporarily by the entry of China and the former nations of the Soviet Union into the global market economy and by the information and communications revolution.\u201d In other words, the technological advances that brought rapid growth in the 30 years after the second world war are now exhausted. Robert Gordon, the US economist, has argued that recent technological innovations are not as growth-rich as those that arrived at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. The counter-argument is that the new waves of technology \u2013 from robotics to bioengineering \u2013 will be just as important as those in the past, but that it is taking time for the benefits to be felt. This is essentially the theory of long-run economic cycles lasting 50 or 60 years, first identified by the Soviet economist Nikolai Kondratiev. As the IMF notes, it can take time for these advances to become fully commercially exploited and to show up in national output. It took until the 1950s, when President Eisenhower built the interstate highway network, for the US to exploit the internal combustion engine, even though the first cars were on the roads by the end of the 19th century. Seen in this context, four years of weaker than expected global growth is neither here nor there.",

      "bodyText": "The Conservative leadership once advocated powering 21st-century Britain with a green industrial revolution based on the smart, internet-linked, decentralised technologies being invested in by Silicon Valley, China, and others. Now, unified in majority government, they seem intent on the reverse: exploiting shale gas, building new nuclear facilities, and actively undermining clean-energy competition. It is the new Labour leader who offers the vision of a renewable-powered UK economy today, one maximally efficient and optimally wired, allowing avoidance of both shale and new nuclear. Which vision should the business community be backing? As a pioneer in the renewables industries, my view might be discountable. Less so, I submit, the evidence in balance sheets, or the concerns of the Bank of England. Nearly a year of low oil prices has been a disaster for drillers of oil and gas in American shale. Their costs of production are mostly far above sales prices, notwithstanding innovative improvements in the cost-efficiency of fracking. They have only been able to keep going because of Wall Street\u2019s willingness to shovel mountains of debt in their direction: nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars of it to date, mostly junk rated. Eight drillers have already gone bankrupt and it can be expected many more will not survive the review by banks of credit lines coming up in October. Analysts speak of imminent carnage [WSJ; subscription]. The US shale boom is heading for bust. There is a whiff of subprime in the spectacle. On top of this collapsing economic model pile environmental woes. Recent studies suggest worrying rates of methane leakage from US shale operations. The inventor of the monitoring device routinely used by the industry warns that a fault in his invention means historical estimates of leakage are severely understated. Gas may not be better than coal, in greenhouse terms, after all. In the face of this emerging news, the Obama administration has announced a crackdown on methane leakage, and new emissions targets for the power sector fast-tracking renewables ahead of gas. Meanwhile, the case for nuclear is beset with economic and safety problems. The size of the cheques the chancellor is prepared to write for outsourcing new nuclear to French and now Chinese interests has already landed one court case from Europe on his desk. Austria is aghast at both the inexplicable enormity of the subsidies and the UK retreat from EU renewables targets. With the Paris climate summit looming, it is far from alone. More legal challenges can be expected on the Treasury doormat. On top of this, a dire safety flaw has emerged in the French reactor that is the intended forerunner of new British nuclear stations. High carbon content discovered in the pressure vessel steel, weakening it beyond regulatory acceptability, is a problem so potent that it poses an existential threat to the project, and potentially to the industry itself. The French have yet to reveal either the cause of the fault or the additional cost to a project already billions over budget and years behind schedule. Meanwhile, the green industrial revolution continues to unfold fast elsewhere in the world, amid plunging costs. Renewables have provided more new electricity generation capacity globally than fossil fuels and nuclear combined in each of the last two years. Apple plans to be mass producing solar-charged electric vehicles less than five years from now. Goodness knows what information-based energy innovations are in the pipeline at Google. Both companies have invested more than $1bn in renewables to date. Ikea is now selling solar roofs alongside wardrobes. UBS calculates that within five years homes fully powered by a solar roof, a battery bank, and an electric vehicle will offer consumers a 7% annual rate of return on an investment paying back fully in six to eight years without a subsidy in sight. Meanwhile, both the nuclear and shale industries openly admit they cannot add to UK electricity supply for at least 10 years, and will require multiple billions in giveaways to have a chance of limping to that point. To go with this field of icebergs the Treasury has elected to steam through, the governor of the Bank of England this week added another. In a speech and a BBC interview, Mark Carney described climate change as the biggest future threat to economies, concluded that the majority of fossil fuel reserves must be deemed unburnable, and voiced concerns about the risk of stranded assets destabilising markets. It is imperative that investors be provided with information that allows them to \u201cinvest accordingly\u201d, he said, clearly meaning that they should stop further inflating the carbon bubble, in order to increase the chances of an orderly retreat from fossil fuels. This is the first time a regulator has defined climate change as a major financial risk. It shines a whole new light on the irresponsibility of the Treasury\u2019s version of UK energy policy. The obsession with exploiting UK shale is now, by corollary, a threat to the stability of capital markets. George Osborne needs to stop listening to lobbyists defending dying 20th-century technologies and industries, and start listening to Jeremy Corbyn and Mark Carney. \u2022Jeremy Leggett is a social entrepreneur and author of The Winning of the Carbon War.",

Earlier, the French transport minister, Alain Vidalies, said the images of an Air France human resources manager with his shirt ripped off amounted to a caricature of France that was unhelpful to the airline\u2019s future. \u201cI think the best French response would be to respond to those abroad who see a caricature, that these events are not France, and that we can get back on track by talking.\u201d He said there was no question of renationalisation for the airline. \u201cIt\u2019s not the taxpayer who is going to pay.\u201d The French state holds a 17% stake in the airline. A legal investigation has been opened after Air France lodged a complaint over aggravated violence, saying seven people were injured, including a security guard who was seriously hurt. Air France-KLM\u2019s human resources manager, Xavier Broseta, had his shirt ripped off and, wearing just his tie and trousers, had to clamber over a wire fence to safety after hundreds of striking workers stormed the board meeting on Monday in protest at the planned job cuts.

      "bodyText": "Car sales accelerated in September to an all-time high for the month, driven by a surge in purchases of petrol vehicles, according to industry figures. The usually strong month for sales was boosted by sales increases for all types of vehicles, including diesel cars, but the 12.3% petrol increase was the main factor pushing total registrations to 462,517 \u2013 8.6% ahead of last September\u2019s figure. Some analysts had expected diesel sales to falter after the Volkswagen scandal hit the headlines, revealing that Europe\u2019s biggest carmaker had cheated emissions tests on millions of diesel cars. But it is likely that advance deposits on diesels, often made months ahead, cushioned the blow to the industry. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the popularity of new cars was unabated as buyers exploited a range of competitive deals on the latest 65 plate, making it the 43rd consecutive month of growth in the market. Sales this year have moved up another gear to overtake the 2m mark, the first time since 2004. The Ford Fiesta retained its position as Britain\u2019s top-selling car in an industry increasingly dominated by smaller-engined vehicles. The Vauxhall Corsa and Ford Focus were second and third in the rankings. Although the Mercedes-Benz C-Class is one of the 10 bestselling cars this year, it dropped out of the September list along with the Audi A3. It is possible that people had already turned against larger-engined cars, but it is more likely that Mercedes and Audi were suffering from the reluctance of consumers to buy diesels. The increase in diesels was 4.1% in September, well behind the figure for petrol car sales in a market that has seen purchases balanced between the two types for several years. Hybrid vehicles and electric cars zoomed ahead after a 21.7% increase, albeit from a relatively low base. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the strong rise in sales bucked the trend for modest high street sales and the uncertainty among business and consumers triggered by the stock market gyrations during the summer. \u201cWhile the UK economy may currently be going through a softer patch, this is certainly not true of car sales, which notched up a highly impressive year-on-year gain in the key month of September, with increases across all sectors. \u201cDespite September\u2019s strong gain, It is unrealistic to expect car sales to keep churning out strong year-on-year growth rates given that they have now risen for a record 43 consecutive months, and are now coming from a very high base. \u201cThe likely main concern for the car industry is that a current more uncertain economic outlook causes fleet operators to be more cautious in their purchases of new vehicles. \u201cThe economic fundamentals still look largely healthy for the motor industry, which will hopefully allow car sales to at least stabilise at an elevated level over the coming months. Car sales will also likely to continue to be buoyed by attractive offers and finance packages. It remains to be seen what impact the VW scandal has on sales of diesel cars.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Australia and the Trans-Pacific Partnership: what we do and don't know", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, calls it a \u201cgigantic foundation stone for our future prosperity\u201d, but what does the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) mean for Australia? The short answer is that we don\u2019t know for sure, because the full text of the deal has yet to be released. We simply have assurances from the government and various industry groups about the elements of the 12-country trade pact finalised in Atlanta in the US on Monday. Those details form the basis of this summary. Big picture The TPP includes the US, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei. Together these countries represent about 40% of global gross domestic product. China \u2013 a key strategic rival to the US \u2013 is not part of the deal. The government says the TPP will eliminate 98% of tariffs (import penalties designed to protect local suppliers) across a range of sectors, improving access for Australian goods exports, services and investment. The trade-offs It is not clear what Australian tariffs the government has agreed to cut in the deal, because the government media release focuses on implications for Australian exporters rather than the impacts on local businesses (such as manufacturers) that may face greater competition from overseas companies selling cheap goods to Australians. Turnbull says Australia \u201cis an open economy with relatively low tariffs anyway, so for us to eliminate or lower our tariffs is not giving up a lot\u201d. The trade minister, Andrew Robb, says electronic and white goods coming into Australia will be cheaper for consumers. Robb says existing manufacturers \u201cmay have to transition and change the focus of their business, or increase their investment to become more efficient\u201d. But he argues that high-end manufacturers in Australia could become more competitive because of falling input costs (parts they use in their products could be brought in more cheaply). Guardian Australia is seeking more details from Robb\u2019s office about Australia\u2019s commitments. Pharmaecutical sticking point Australia \u2013 with several other countries \u2013 resisted a US push to patent rules for new medicines. Big pharmaceutical companies wanted their new biologic medicines to be protected from cheaper, generic competition for longer, which would have driven up the cost of Australia\u2019s pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Robb, who had described it as a red-line issue in negotiations, says: \u201cThe government has delivered on its promise not to change Australia\u2019s existing five years of data protection for biologic medicines or any other part of our health system, including our pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Concerns that the price of medicines would increase have proven to be absolutely unfounded.\u201d The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America says it is disappointed ministers failed to secure 12 years of data protection. Political parties and health groups in Australia have vowed to scrutinise the full text against Robb\u2019s assurance. The US government\u2019s summary is oblique: \u201cIn addition, the [intellectual property] chapter contains pharmaceutical-related provisions that facilitate both the development of innovative, life-saving medicines and the availability of generic medicines, taking into account the time that various parties may need to meet these standards.\u201d Dispute mechanism The TPP includes an investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism that allows companies to sue governments. The full details have yet to be released, but the Australian government says the mechanism \u201ccontains safeguards to protect legitimate government regulation in the areas of health and the environment\u201d. \u201cAustralia will be able to ensure that tobacco control measures are never open to challenge, an issue on which we have been a leading voice,\u201d Robb says. Australia remains in the middle of a dispute with Philip Morris, which has brought a case against Australia under a previous trade deal with Hong Kong. The case relates to the plain packaging legislation introduced by the former Labor government. Critics of ISDS provisions argue they undermine sovereignty and give far too much power to big corporations to subvert democratic decision-making. The US government insists there will be \u201cstrong safeguards to prevent abusive and frivolous claims and ensure the right of governments to regulate in the public interest, including on health, safety, and environmental protection\u201d. Australian beef exports Robb says tariffs on beef into Mexico and Canada will be eliminated within 10 years and there are further gains in Japan. The Australian meat and livestock industry says the tariffs levied on Australian beef entering Japan will be reduced from those negotiated under the recently completed Japan-Australia trade deal (JAEPA). \u201cThe tariff on both frozen and chilled beef will fall to 9% over 15 years, as opposed to the end point of 19.5% for frozen beef and 23.5% for chilled beef secured under the JAEPA,\u201d the industry says, but points out that all TPP member countries supplying beef to Japan will be similarly advantaged by the TPP tariff cuts. Sugar exports The government says there will be a further levy reduction for high polarity sugar into Japan; elimination of the tariff on refined sugar into Canada; elimination of tariffs on raw sugar into Peru; wholesale licensing arrangements for supply of refined sugar to the food and beverage industries in Malaysia will be liberalised. Robb says Australian sugar exporters will also have an extra quota of 65,000 tonnes of the base allocation of the US market, as well as a 23% share of additional allocations \u2013 triple the previous amount. Australia\u2019s average annual exports of sugar to the US are 107,000 tonnes. The sugar industry had wanted to rectify the US-Australia free trade agreement, negotiated a decade ago, which excluded sugar. The Australian Sugar Industry Alliance describes the finalisation of the TPP as \u201cbittersweet\u201d, saying it is disappointed that \u201cthe US sugar lobby was successful in blocking all but a small amount of additional market access for Australian sugar\u201d. \u201cThe increase in access for Australian sugar is welcome but it must be recognised that it comes from a very low start, with an annual increase of 65,000 tonnes, for a total of 152,000 tonnes,\u201d says the chairman of Canegrowers, Paul Schembri. \u201cIn today\u2019s market, that extra access translates to approximately $13m per year benefit for the Australian sugar industry.\u201d Other agricultural exports The government says Australia will be able to export more rice to Japan and it has reached agreement on administrative arrangements to facilitate trade, while rice tariffs into Mexico will be eliminated. In Japan, tariffs are to be eliminated on a range of cheeses and there will be a new quota access for Australia on butter and skim milk powder, the government says. \u201cAustralian exports to Japan of mozzarella for processing use will be duty free when blended with Japanese cheese.\u201d Australia says it has also won access for 9,000 more tonnes of cheese to the US and tariff elimination on milk powders and Swiss cheese, and it will gain preferential access into Mexico and the highly protected Canadian market. Tariffs are also to be eliminated on wheat and barley exports into Mexico within 10 years, and Canada when the deal takes effect, along with reductions of the mark-ups applied to wheat and barley in Japan. Wine tariffs are to be phased out for products going to Mexico, Canada, Peru, Malaysia and Vietnam. There is also movement on seafood, with the government saying tariffs into Canada and Peru will be eliminated straight away, whereas this will occur in Japan within 16 years and Mexico within 15 years. Energy exports The government says the TPP will deliver immediate elimination of tariffs on iron ore, copper and nickel to Peru; elimination of tariffs on butanes, propane and liquefied natural gas to Vietnam within seven years; elimination of Vietnam\u2019s 20% tariffs on refined petroleum. Manufacturing exports The government says Australia will benefit from the immediate elimination of tariffs on iron and steel products exported to Canada, and to Vietnam within 10 years; the elimination of ship tariffs in Canada over six to 11 years; the elimination of tariffs on pharmaceutical, machinery, mechanical and electrical appliances, and automotive parts to Mexico within 10 years; the elimination of tariffs on pharmaceuticals to Peru over 11 years. Australian exporters are also being told to expect the elimination of duties on paper and paperboard to Peru over 11 years and the scrapping of tariffs on automotive parts to Vietnam over 10 years. \u201cAustralian businesses will now be able to bid for tenders to supply goods (such as drugs and pharmaceutical products, electronic components and supplies) used for government purposes in Brunei, Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam,\u201d the government says. A ban on local content requirements The US government\u2019s summary says the TPP provides investment protections including \u201cprohibition on \u2018performance requirements\u2019 such as local content or technology localisation requirements\u201d. This is likely to be of interest to unions. Foreign investment in Australia The screening threshold, at which private foreign investments in non-sensitive sectors are considered by the Foreign Investment Review Board, will be increased from $252m to $1,094m for all TPP countries. \u201cUnder the TPP, Australia has retained the ability to screen investments in sensitive sectors to ensure they do not raise issues contrary to the national interest,\u201d the government says. \u201cAll investments by foreign governments will continue to be examined and lower screening thresholds will apply to investment in agricultural land and agribusiness.\u201d When will the TPP be released? Unions and numerous other stakeholders have suggested that if the deal is so good, the details would not remain a secret. The Australian government says the TPP parties will finalise arrangements for the release of the text \u201cand it will be released well in advance of signature\u201d. Each country will have to take steps to bring the deal into effect. \u201cFor Australia, this will involve tabling the treaty text in parliament along with a national interest analysis and a review by the joint standing committee on treaties to which all interested parties can make submissions.\u201d",

Those details form the basis of this summary.</p> <h2><strong>Big picture</strong></h2> <p>The TPP includes the US, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei. Together these countries represent about 40% of global gross domestic product. China \u2013 a key strategic rival to the US \u2013 is not part of the deal.</p> <p>The government says the TPP will eliminate 98% of tariffs (import penalties designed to protect local suppliers) across a range of sectors, improving access for Australian goods exports, services and investment.</p> <h2><strong>The trade-offs</strong></h2> <p>It is not clear what Australian tariffs the government has agreed to cut in the deal, because <a href=\"http://trademinister.gov.au/releases/Pages/2015/ar_mr_151006.aspx\">the government media release</a> focuses on implications for Australian exporters rather than the impacts on local businesses (such as manufacturers) that may face greater competition from overseas companies selling cheap goods to Australians. Turnbull says Australia \u201cis an open economy with relatively low tariffs anyway, so for us to eliminate or lower our tariffs is not giving up a lot\u201d.</p> <p>The trade minister, Andrew Robb, says electronic and white goods coming into Australia will be cheaper for consumers. Robb says existing manufacturers \u201cmay have to transition and change the focus of their business, or increase their investment to become more efficient\u201d. But he argues that high-end manufacturers in Australia could become more competitive because of falling input costs (parts they use in their products could be brought in more cheaply).</p> <p>Guardian Australia is seeking more details from Robb\u2019s office about Australia\u2019s commitments.</p> <h2><strong>Pharmaecutical sticking point</strong></h2> <p>Australia \u2013 with several other countries \u2013 resisted a US push to patent rules for new medicines. Big pharmaceutical companies wanted their new biologic medicines to be protected from cheaper, generic competition for longer, which would have driven up the cost of Australia\u2019s pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/04/andrew-robb-australia-and-us-close-to-drug-patent-compromise-for-tpp-deal\">Andrew Robb: Australia and US close to drug patent compromise for TPP deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Robb, who had described it as a red-line issue in negotiations, says: \u201cThe government has delivered on its promise not to change Australia\u2019s existing five years of data protection for biologic medicines or any other part of our health system, including our pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Concerns that the price of medicines would increase have proven to be absolutely unfounded.\u201d</p> <p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America says it is disappointed ministers failed to secure 12 years of data protection. Political parties and health groups in Australia have vowed to scrutinise the full text against Robb\u2019s assurance.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2015/october/summary-trans-pacific-partnership\">US government\u2019s summary</a> is oblique: \u201cIn addition, the [intellectual property] chapter contains pharmaceutical-related provisions that facilitate both the development of innovative, life-saving medicines and the availability of generic medicines, taking into account the time that various parties may need to meet these standards.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Dispute mechanism</strong></h2> <p>The TPP includes an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/14/bill-to-ban-investor-state-dispute-settlements-garners-support\">investor-state dispute settlement</a> (ISDS) mechanism that allows companies to sue governments. The full details have yet to be released, but the Australian government says the mechanism \u201ccontains safeguards to protect legitimate government regulation in the areas of health and the environment\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/24/penny-wong-expected-to-fight-free-trade-clauses-that-let-companies-sue-australia\">Penny Wong backs fight against free-trade clauses that let companies sue Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAustralia will be able to ensure that tobacco control measures are never open to challenge, an issue on which we have been a leading voice,\u201d Robb says.</p> <p>Australia remains in the middle of a dispute with <a href=\"https://www.ag.gov.au/tobaccoplainpackaging\">Philip Morris, which has brought a case against Australia</a> under a previous trade deal with Hong Kong. The case relates to the plain packaging legislation introduced by the former Labor government.<br></p> <p>Critics of ISDS provisions argue they undermine sovereignty and give far too much power to big corporations to subvert democratic decision-making.</p> <p>The US government insists there will be \u201cstrong safeguards to prevent abusive and frivolous claims and ensure the right of governments to regulate in the public interest, including on health, safety, and environmental protection\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Australian beef exports</strong></h2> <p>Robb says tariffs on beef into Mexico and Canada will be eliminated within 10 years and there are further gains in Japan. The Australian meat and livestock industry says the tariffs levied on Australian beef entering Japan will be reduced from those negotiated under the recently completed Japan-Australia trade deal (JAEPA).</p> <p>\u201cThe tariff on both frozen and chilled beef will fall to 9% over 15 years, as opposed to the end point of 19.5% for frozen beef and 23.5% for chilled beef secured under the JAEPA,\u201d the industry says, but points out that all TPP member countries supplying beef to Japan will be similarly advantaged by the TPP tariff cuts.</p> <h2><strong>Sugar exports</strong></h2> <p>The government says there will be a further levy reduction for high polarity sugar into Japan; elimination of the tariff on refined sugar into Canada; elimination of tariffs on raw sugar into Peru; wholesale licensing arrangements for supply of refined sugar to the food and beverage industries in Malaysia will be liberalised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/25/bill-heffernan-us-beef-imports-trans-pacific-partnership\">Bill Heffernan vows to block any US beef imports under Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Robb says Australian sugar exporters will also have an extra quota of 65,000 tonnes of the base allocation of the US market, as well as a 23% share of additional allocations \u2013 triple the previous amount. Australia\u2019s average annual exports of sugar to the US are 107,000 tonnes. </p> <p>The sugar industry had wanted to rectify the US-Australia free trade agreement, negotiated a decade ago, which excluded sugar.</p> <p>The Australian Sugar Industry Alliance describes the finalisation of the TPP as \u201cbittersweet\u201d, saying it is disappointed that \u201cthe US sugar lobby was successful in blocking all but a small amount of additional market access for Australian sugar\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe increase in access for Australian sugar is welcome but it must be recognised that it comes from a very low start, with an annual increase of 65,000 tonnes, for a total of 152,000 tonnes,\u201d says the chairman of Canegrowers, Paul Schembri. \u201cIn today\u2019s market, that extra access translates to approximately $13m per year benefit for the Australian sugar industry.\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>Other agricultural exports</strong></h2> <p>The government says Australia will be able to export more rice to Japan and it has reached agreement on administrative arrangements to facilitate trade, while rice tariffs into Mexico will be eliminated.</p> <p>In Japan, tariffs are to be eliminated on a range of cheeses and there will be a new quota access for Australia on butter and skim milk powder, the government says. \u201cAustralian exports to Japan of mozzarella for processing use will be duty free when blended with Japanese cheese.\u201d</p> <p>Australia says it has also won access for 9,000 more tonnes of cheese to the US and tariff elimination on milk powders and Swiss cheese, and it will gain preferential access into Mexico and the highly protected Canadian market.</p> <p>Tariffs are also to be eliminated on wheat and barley exports into Mexico within 10 years, and Canada when the deal takes effect, along with reductions of the mark-ups applied to wheat and barley in Japan.</p> <p>Wine tariffs are to be phased out for products going to Mexico, Canada, Peru, Malaysia and Vietnam. There is also movement on seafood, with the government saying tariffs into Canada and Peru will be eliminated straight away, whereas this will occur in Japan within 16 years and Mexico within 15 years.</p> <h2><strong>Energy exports</strong></h2> <p>The government says the TPP will deliver immediate elimination of tariffs on iron ore, copper and nickel to Peru; elimination of tariffs on butanes, propane and liquefied natural gas to Vietnam within seven years; elimination of Vietnam\u2019s 20% tariffs on refined petroleum.</p> <h2><strong>Manufacturing exports</strong></h2> <p>The government says Australia will benefit from the immediate elimination of tariffs on iron and steel products exported to Canada, and to Vietnam within 10 years; the elimination of ship tariffs in Canada over six to 11 years; the elimination of tariffs on pharmaceutical, machinery, mechanical and electrical appliances, and automotive parts to Mexico within 10 years; the elimination of tariffs on pharmaceuticals to Peru over 11 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/22/labor-greens-and-crossbenchers-concerned-at-trans-pacific-partnership\">Labor, Greens and crossbenchers concerned at Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australian exporters are also being told to expect the elimination of duties on paper and paperboard to Peru over 11 years and the scrapping of tariffs on automotive parts to Vietnam over 10 years.</p> <p>\u201cAustralian businesses will now be able to bid for tenders to supply goods (such as drugs and pharmaceutical products, electronic components and supplies) used for government purposes in Brunei, Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam,\u201d the government says.</p> <h2><strong>A ban on local content requirements</strong></h2> <p>The US government\u2019s summary says the TPP provides investment protections including \u201cprohibition on \u2018performance requirements\u2019 such as local content or technology localisation requirements\u201d.

      "bodyText": "ANZ bank has pledged not to finance traditional coalmining projects and to provide at least $10bn in funding for renewable energy, reforestation and energy efficiency. In the most significant steps yet by one of Australia\u2019s big four banks on climate change, ANZ said its new policies would help a \u201cgradual and orderly transition\u201d from fossil fuels to clean energy such as solar and wind. The bank has ruled out funding \u201cconventional coal-fired power plants\u201d that do not use commercially proven technologies that significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions below 800 kilograms per megawatt hour. The $10bn commitment, over five years, will fund a range of low-carbon initiatives such as renewables, low-emissions transport, reforestation and carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS has been hailed by the coal industry as a way to prolong the viability of fossil fuels. However, the technology, which captures emissions and stores them underground, is very much in its infancy, with only one commercially operational plant \u2013 in Canada \u2013 fitted with CCS. In its climate statement, ANZ said: \u201cWe understand some of our stakeholders view our financing of fossil fuel industries as a material risk and in direct conflict with our stated position on the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cToday, around 40% of the world\u2019s electricity comes from coal-fired power stations and coal remains the cheapest source of fuel. We therefore consider that decarbonisation of the economy must be managed responsibly and over time.\u201d ANZ has come under fire from climate activists due to its position as Australia\u2019s largest lender to fossil fuel projects, backing the controversial Maules Creek mine in New South Wales. But ANZ said it was committed to the internationally agreed target of limiting global warming to 2C above pre-industrial times. The bank said it would transparently report its progress on climate and set targets to reduce its own emissions. Australia three other largest banks \u2013 Westpac, Commonwealth Bank and NAB \u2013 are all signed up to sustainability commitments for their lending. But environmental groups have pressed them to do more by ruling out investment in coal projects, as overseas banks have done with Adani\u2019s huge Carmichael mine in Queensland. Last week the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warned insurers of a potential financial crisis due to exposure to climate change risks. \u201cThe challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThe far-sighted amongst you are anticipating broader global impacts on property, migration and political stability, as well as food and water security. So why isn\u2019t more being done to address it?\u201d The chief executive of the Australian-based Investor Group on Climate Change, Emma Herd, welcomed ANZ\u2019s statement. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of work going on behind the scenes over the last 12 to 18 months on how to measure carbon risk, and this is the first time we\u2019ve seen an Australian bank come out so specifically on the measures they will take,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are also seeing ANZ factor the 2C target into their business practice, to articulate what it means for them. AGL and BHP have also done this recently. We are seeing a consensus emerge around that 2C target.\u201d Herd said the investment in clean energy and related measures was \u201cvery significant\u201d. \u201cThe dollar commitment is significant but the signal it sends is more important, especially when you consider that this applies to ANZ\u2019s operations in Asia,\u201d she said. \u201cAustralia has a carbon-intensive economy and companies need to have a plan on how to manage their carbon risk.\u201d According to University College London, 90% of Australia\u2019s known coal reserves must be left unburned to keep the world on track to avoid warming above 2C. Analysis released by AGL last year showed that 75% of Australia\u2019s ageing coal-fired power stations were operating beyond their \u201cuseful life\u201d but that it was too expensive to shut them down.",

      "bodyText": "Australia has resisted a United States push to make changes to medicine patent rules and will gain \u201cenormous benefits\u201d from increased market access across the Asia-Pacific in a 12-country trade deal, the Turnbull government has said. The trade minister, Andrew Robb, joined representatives of the other countries, including the US, Japan, New Zealand and Canada, to announce the conclusion of negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in Atlanta on Monday. But the text of the 30-chapter deal could remain secret for weeks, leaving it to governments to promote the benefits. Critics renewed their concerns about the lack of detail, including on the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism that would allow companies to sue governments. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the deal as a \u201cgigantic foundation stone for our future prosperity\u201d and said Australia had succeeded in resisting a push to extend protections for big pharmaceutical companies that release new drugs. Such an extension would have increased the time before cheaper, generic drugs could come onto the market, driving up the cost for Australia\u2019s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Robb, who had described it as a \u201cred-line issue\u201d, said the TPP would require no changes to Australia\u2019s patent system and copyright regime. \u201cThe government has delivered on its promise not to change Australia\u2019s existing five years of data protection for biologic medicines or any other part of our health system, including our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cConcerns that the price of medicines would increase have proven to be absolutely unfounded.\u201d Turnbull said he had spoken about the issue with the US president, Barack Obama, in a \u201clong discussion\u201d last week. The prime minister said he had also \u201cspent many hours on the phone\u201d with Robb, which had prolonged the negotiations in Atlanta. \u201cAndrew has done an extraordinary job for Australia. I think it is a very big win,\u201d Turnbull told 3AW radio. \u201cWhat this means is that in an age of a rapidly globalising economy, where services are more important than ever ... where Australia is an open economy with relatively low tariffs anyway ... this is a gigantic foundation stone for our future prosperity.\u201d The 12 countries in the TPP account for about 40% of global gross domestic product. According to a summary released by the Australian government, the deal would further cut tariffs on exports of beef to Japan, eliminate barriers on beef into Mexico and Canada within 10 years, and scrap the safeguard on beef exports that was included in Australia\u2019s previous free trade agreement with the United States. The government said the Australian sugar industry would be allowed an extra 65,000 tonnes of base allocation of access to the US market, and a 23% share of additional allocations, although Robb told the ABC it was \u201cnot as much as we wanted\u201d and \u201cthe sugar people will be disappointed\u201d. National party members also expressed their dissatisfaction. The north Queensland-based backbench MP George Christensen said he would be \u201creserving my right to cross the floor on the deal, depending on the outcome of other factors plaguing the sugar industry\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed at how the land of the free has determined to block free trade and deny our sugar growers access to their market,\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday. But the agriculture minister and deputy Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, pointed to the overall gains for the agricultural sector and said the government had managed to negotiate \u201cthe first improvement in sugar access to the US market in 20 years\u201d. Australia would be able to export more rice to Japan, and access for dairy products would also be improved, according to the government summary. There are also tariff cuts for cereals, wine, seafood, iron ore, copper, nickel, liquefied natural gas, refined petroleum, iron and steel products, and automotive parts. Robb said the investment chapter included \u201ca modern\u201d investor-state dispute settlement mechanism \u201cwhich contains safeguards to protect legitimate government regulation in the areas of health and the environment\u201d. \u201cAustralia will be able to ensure that tobacco control measures are never open to challenge, an issue on which we have been a leading voice,\u201d he said. Labor reaffirmed its opposition to investor-state dispute settlement provisions and vowed to carefully scrutinise the details. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, and the party\u2019s trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, said the TPP had \u201csignificant potential benefits for Australia\u201d but the government must release the text as soon as possible. \u201cRight now, the government is asking Australians to take its word for it,\u201d they said in a joint statement. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said he was not satisfied with the assurances about the dispute mechanism. \u201cThe exemptions and carve-outs haven\u2019t worked in other trade deals,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve given special rights to sue through these shady tribunals it\u2019s very hard to stop them taking strategic litigation.\u201d Whish-Wilson pointed to the New Zealand government\u2019s reluctance to push ahead with plain packaging laws for tobacco until there was a result in the Philip Morris case against Australia under a trade deal with Hong Kong. He issued a broader critique of the TPP process. \u201cIt\u2019s just totally flawed; it gives the government the chance to go out and spin another \u2018win-win\u2019 trade deal that we know absolutely nothing about.\u201d The Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network warned that \u201cthe devil is in the detail\u201d and the full text might not be released for another month. Patricia Ranald, who coordinates the network, said: \u201cThe announcement of a secret \u2018in principle\u2019 TPP deal without publication of the text may hide shameful trade-offs on issues like medicines and corporate rights to sue governments. These should be decided though open democratic parliamentary processes, not secretly traded away for token access to sugar or dairy markets.\u201d The Australian Council of Trade Unions raised concern the negotiations had favoured big corporations and the TPP had been agreed \u201cwithout the Australian public being privy to details which have ramifications for our sovereignty, intellectual property rights and jobs\u201d. \u201cAustralian unions support trade deals with outcomes that are balanced, support jobs, protect the rights of working people and promote a healthy environment \u2013 there\u2019s a great probability that TPP deal does not achieve this,\u201d the peak union body said in a statement. The ACTU president, Ged Kearney, asked why the details were still hidden if it was such a good deal. Greenpeace also criticised the lack of transparency. Emma Gibson, the head of program for Greenpeace Australia Pacific, asked whether a multinational backer of an environmentally hazardous mining project could seek to overturn an Australian court\u2019s refusal to approve it in a special tribunal. But the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kate Carnell, praised the agreement, saying it would eliminate 98% of tariffs in the TPP region. \u201cThis deal will smooth the way for Australia to play a greater role in the global economy by opening up borders to goods and services,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile no deal is perfect, this one achieves substantial advances for Australian agricultural producers, service industries and manufacturers while also leaving Australian consumers better off.\u201d The Australian Industry Group\u2019s chief executive, Innes Willox, said the TPP had the potential to transform industry\u2019s engagement across the Pacific. \u201cIt gives easier access into markets that have been particularly tough nuts to crack,\u201d he said. \u201cOur experience in some free trade agreements has been that non-tariff barriers have increased, negating the benefits of tariff reductions. We are pleased to see that negotiators have included mechanisms to address non-tariff barriers within the agreement, ensuring that it is a dynamic and practical tool for ongoing trade access.\u201d The National Farmers\u2019 Federation said the TPP would improve market access for a range of agricultural commodities, including red meat, dairy, fibre and grains, and built on existing trade agreements. The NFF said it was \u201cregrettable that more leadership was not demonstrated by the likes of the US in sectors such as sugar\u201d but there was no doubt Australia needed to be a party to the TPP. \u201cThe nature of agreement means that exclusion from a completed TPP agreement would have delivered significant negative outcomes for Australian agriculture.\u201d The TPP does not include China, whose recent bilateral trade agreement with Australia has been at the centre of a political dispute in Canberra about job safeguards.",
