      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King told the nation on Wednesday night that the credit crunch had been a \"bust without a boom\". The Bank has consistently argued that although households' borrowing increased sharply in the decade before 2007, they had something to show for it, because they used the money to buy a pile of assets \u2013 not least their homes. From this eagle's-eye perspective, it doesn't matter too much for the economic outlook that we're all saddled with monster debts. But a new paper by Angus Armstrong, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, suggests some reasons we might need to think again. One problem is, the people taking on more credit and those buying up assets were often not the same people. Armstrong points out that income inequality increased dramatically in the runup to the crisis, while \"consumption inequality\" \u2013 the gap in living standards between the richest and the poorest \u2013 barely changed. Detailed data on who lent what to whom is hard to come by, but Armstrong suggests one likely explanation is that the rich saved more as their incomes shot up while the poor took out a rising amount of credit, not to invest, but simply to make ends meet or keep up with the neighbours. In fact, the sophisticated mortgage-backed security market, which allowed banks to package up home loans and sell them on, helped to transfer the savings of wealthy investors \u2013 whose investment funds bought up mortgage-backed securities by the bucketful \u2013 to poorer borrowers. Mortgage rates fell; loan-to-value ratios shot up; the borrowing boom went on. And that brings us to a second problem: today, the FSA believes up to 8% of mortgages are in \"forbearance\", with borrowers in arrears but their lenders reluctant to foreclose because that would mean crystallising losses on thousands of loans. Armstrong says these paralysed households resemble Japan's \"zombie firms\" of the 1990s \u2013 effectively insolvent, but kept going by their banks. Without the unlikely event of an economic upturn, the result is likely to be complete paralysis on the lower rungs of the housing ladder. And while rich savers can bear the losses if some of their investments go sour, for the poor households who borrowed their way through the noughties and are struggling to afford their \"assets\", the distress will be severe.",

      "bodyText": "You can't say we weren't warned. Lord Digby Jones, a former director-general of the CBI, has long cautioned that \"if we don't watch out, China will eat our lunch\". On Thursday, it got started, with breakfast. A state-owned Chinese company is gobbling up a majority stake in Weetabix for \u00a3720m. \"I have been waking people up for years to the fact that China and India wanted our lunch, but I never thought they would want our breakfast as well,\" Jones, who is now a UK trade ambassador, said. Weetabix, made in Northamptonshire and exported to more than 80 countries, is the nation's favourite breakfast product \u2013 we get through 3.4m biscuits a day. Sources close to the Shanghai-based buyer, Bright Food, said China's second biggest food company had its sights set on taking over a string of household names. \"They won't stop here,\" one source said. \"I'd be very surprised if this was the last British brand they take over.\" One City analyst suggested the cereal deal underlined the \"global power shift from the west to the east\". Bright Food has already splashed out on a 75% stake in Australia's Manassen Food for more than $500m and a 51% stake in New Zealand dairy producer Synlait. Last year it offered more than \u00a31.2bn for United Biscuits, the name behind British snacks such as Hula Hoops, Twiglets and Jaffa Cakes. It has also attempted to take over French yoghurt group Yoplait and been linked with Campbell's Soups and Premier Foods, the company behind Mr Kipling cakes, Bisto gravy and Loyd Grossman sauces. Jones, who admitted to eating Weetabix for breakfast every other day \u2013 alternating with porridge \u2013 said he had \"no problem\" with China gobbling up great British brands, but just wished that they would be \"similarly open to British investment in China\". Bright Foods' chairman, Zongnan Wang, who sealed the deal with a couple of celebratory Weetabix, said in a statement that he was \"excited\" about bringing the 80-year-old wheat biscuits to breakfast tables across China and Asia, where western eating habits are slowly catching on as wealthier citizens begin to shun traditional rice and steamed bread. Despite Weetabix being derided by a head chef at the Savoy as \"cakes that you give to dogs\", Weetabix's chief executive, Giles Turrell, said he believed there were \"substantial opportunities to further grow the business internationally, in North America, Asia and beyond\". Industry experts warned that Weetabix may find breaking into the Chinese market difficult because of high levels of lactose intolerance among the population. However, Marcia Mogelonsky, an expert on food and drink at the market researcher Mintel, said there was \"huge growth potential\" for breakfast cereals in China, where just $665m was spent on them last year, compared with $2.3bn in the UK. Mogelonsky said Bright Foods, which makes a huge range of products including canned meats, alcohol and sweets and even runs a taxi firm in Shanghai, had an \"endless pot of money\" to fund other takeovers. But she expected the company to be selective over which brands it poaches next. \"I don't think it's going to be like Supermarket Sweep with them stripping the shelves of everything in a hurry.\" She said Weetabix would give the Chinese a \"toehold in the UK, which will open up western Europe, which will in turn open up eastern Europe and then the world,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch more out there they can go after.\" Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said the acquisition of 60% of Weetabix was \"just one example\" of the \"global power shift from the west to the east. It's similar to how the bourgeoisie took over from the aristocracy 200 years ago,\" he said. \"Asia and Latin America have got capital but lack experience and gravitas of brands \u2013 that new money is looking for old wealth. I think we're going to see a lot more of it as the old world continues to get poorer and the new gets richer.\" Weetabix, which also makes Alpen and Ready brek, left British control nine years ago when Sir Richard George, whose family had run it since before the second world war, sold the family firm to the flamboyant venture capitalist Lyndon Lea for \u00a3642m. Lea, the 41-year-old son of a Lancashire hairdresser and engineer who is known for hosting parties featuring Cirque de Soleil dancers and sushi served off the bodies of near-naked women at his Californian beach house, was blas\u00e9 about the fivefold return his private equity firm made on the deal. \"It's been a good return for us,\" he said. Lea's Lion Capital firm will retain a 40% stake in the company. Bright Foods has committed itself to safeguarding production at the Weetabix factories in Burton Latimer and Corby, Northamptonshire, where 2,000 workers are employed. The deal came on the same day as a Chinese retailer sealed the acquisition of Gieves &amp; Hawkes from a Hong Kong company, which bought the Savile Row tailor from its British shareholders in 2002 for about \u00a310m.",

      "body": "<p>Before the birth of her fourth child, Keron Bartholomew decided she needed to be near her family in Orlando, Florida. Her partner, Fernando Bogle, was still in college in New York, and was hoping to become a pharmacist. He planned to join them when he graduated. But within a year of her move in 2009, Keron had lost her job. Bogle left school to find a job, but couldn't, and by the end of the year the family was homeless. \"It's been a rat race ever since,\" said Bogle.</p> <p>Since Bartholomew, 30, lost her job at Orlando airport in November 2009 she says she's spent most days looking for a new one. Bogle, 28, eventually found work at Publix, an employee-owned supermarket chain, but money is short and he is looking for a second one. He has put his studies on hold. \"Someone needed to provide. To buy milk and cereal,\" he says.</p> <p>When the US Labor Department releases its latest monthly jobs figures on Friday morning, all eyes will be on the headline number. Rightly or wrongly, with the 2012 election looming the jobs figures have become a monthly report card on Obama's economic policy. Last month they were disappointing, but still positive. With the focus on jobs growth, or the lack of it, the plight of the long-term unemployed is getting ignored.</p> <p>According to the official measures in March there were 5.3 million long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) \u2013 essentially unchanged from February and accounting for 42.5% of the unemployed.</p> <p>But that figure under-represents what is going on in the labour market. Another 7.7 million people were working part-time because they couldn't find full-time work, and another 2.4 million didn't count because they had stopped looking for work.</p> <p>Stock markets are recovering. After two years of pay cuts, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/02/american-ceos-pay-rise\">America's CEOs are back in the money</a>. Meanwhile, life for those at the bottom of the pay scale has just gotten steadily worse. And for Obama, the sense that the recovery is not reaching ordinary Americans could prove the strongest challenge to his chances of a second term in the White House.</p> <p>The Bartholomews spent close to two years living on people's floors; Bogle spent time living in his car. Last year they got a place at the Coalition For the Homeless of Central Florida shelter in Orlando, where they found there were many others in their situation \u2013 families who have found this economic recovery too fragile to support them. This week there were 786 people in Coalition's shelter, including 127 families and 287 children, whose average age was eight. The shelter was the last place they wanted to be. \"In the end we had to face the facts, we weren't staying with friends, we were homeless,\" said Bogle. But the childcare the centre provides has proved a turning point. Bartholomew is on her third round of interviews for a local fast food restaurant and is hopeful she has got it.</p> <p>\"We are seeing more and more families,\" said Brent Trotter, Coalition's president. The impact of long-term unemployment is devastating for families, he said. \"Only a recovery in the jobs market is going to sort this out,\" he said.</p> <p>But while he said businesses were telling him the economy was improving, they still aren't hiring enough people to dig families out of their problems. \"For those looking for work, it's very, very bleak.\"</p> <p>As the US continues to add jobs, albeit slowly, the long-term unemployed are being left behind.</p> <p>According to the labour department, people who have been unemployed fewer than five weeks face a re-employment rate of 31%. If you are unemployed for more than a year, there's just a 9% chance you'll find work.</p> <p>In Florida, and in other states, some companies will only recruit people who already have jobs. Bartholomew says the length of her unemployment is a huge stumbling block in interviews. \"You can see them wondering what's wrong with me,\" she says. \"But it's not like I haven't been looking.\"</p> <h2>Structural shift?</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2010/res/pdf/tvw.pdf\">Academic studies have linked</a> spells of long-term unemployment to lower wages decades after their displacement. Long-term unemployment hits people's health, shortening life spans, knocking up to 18 months of a person's life, <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~vw2112/papers/sullivan_vonwachter_resubmission.pdf\">according to one study from Columbia University</a>. </p> <p>At the start of the downturn this was a \"man-cession\": manufacturing<br>jobs and then white-collar male employees were hit hardest first. More recently, women have been affected, as the government cut backs have hit them harder and women have found themselves competing with men in traditionally female-dominated industries like healthcare.</p> <p>A recent report from the Brookings Institute found that the make-up of this downturn is not \"unprecedented\", as many have claimed. The vulnerable groups \u2013 black men, Latino women, single mothers, older people \u2013 have been hit as they have in previous recessions. What is different is the scale of the problems that the long-term unemployed face.</p> <p>The long-term unemployment rate hit a high of 26% in June 1983. But jobs growth roared back after the early 1980s recession and wiped out long-term unemployment.</p> <p>This time, with the rate at 40% and the recovery in the jobs market still fragile, the long-term unemployed are being left behind. \"This recession has been over for years. Officially it started in December 2007 and ended in the Summer of 2009, and yet three years later we have unemployment over 8%,\" said John Schmitt at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.</p> <p>Some commentators have claimed that the US is going through a structural shift and that unskilled workers are being left behind. Schmitt disagrees.</p> <p>If there was a shortage of skilled workers, those skilled workers would be enjoying a bidding war for their services. If it was about education, graduates wouldn't be suffering so badly, he says.</p> <p>Schmitt points to a Washington Post headline from 1935: \"Skilled workmen in demand despite vast unemployment.\" The subheading read: \"Technological progress has been so rapid during the depression that welders and other experts, idle since 1929, are outmoded.\"</p> <p>It wasn't true then and it isn't true now, Schmitt said.</p> <p>If he's right, the truth about America's long-term unemployment may be more mundane, but in many ways more horrific. There is very little that can be done for the long-term unemployed until the economy starts to recover. The US needs to create about 100,000 jobs a month to stand still and is about 10 million jobs down from where it was before the recession. On current trends it could take until the 2020s for unemployment to get back to 6-7%, a level that the Federal Reserve considers \"normal\". And the ones who are most likely to be last to get jobs are the ones who have been out of work the longest.</p> <h2>'I'd go to a lot of places and they'd tell me I was over-qualified'</h2> <p>The plight of the long-term unemployed sparked the rise of its own protest group in 2010. The 99ers, named after those who had exhausted their 99 weeks of insurance benefits that they can claim, briefly became a hot political topic \u2013&#xa0;hot enough to attract the ire of rightwing media stars like Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and would-be presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. \"It is fundamentally wrong to give people money for 99 weeks for doing nothing,\" Gingrich told a Republican debate in Orlando.</p> <p>No one talks about the 99ers now, says Jim Eichelberg, who still helps coordinate its Chicago chapter. Eichelberg is a former 99er but technically he is now no longer unemployed. A qualified mechanic, he works three days a week cooking and cleaning up at Doyle's Pub, a local bar near his home in Richmond, Illinois, for $8.25 an hour. It's all he can find.</p> <p>\"You mention 99ers today and people say 'what?'\", he said. \"The Hunger Games brought in $1.3bn in three weeks. This nation just wants to be entertained.\"</p> <p>Eichelberg, 54, worked on a farm until he was 40. He'd always worked with engines, and when the farm was sold he decided he'd better get a qualification to prove his expertise. He got a certification in automotive technology at a local college and found a job at Buell, the motorcycle company. After 9/11, the recession bit and he was laid off. Suddenly, he found his qualification was working against him. \"I'd go to a lot of places and they'd tell me I was over-qualified, that I'd get bored. So what! I don't mind. Just hire me,\" he says. \"What are you people looking for?\"</p> <p>He keeps looking for work but feels his age is working against him. \"I walk in with this salt-and-pepper beard and I think they look at me and think: no,\" he said. \"All the politicians say is that jobs are being created, that we created 120,000 jobs last month. Divide that over 50 states.\"</p> <p>More than that, argues Betsey Stevenson, professor of business and public policy at Wharton business school, the US has been creating fewer jobs even in the good times.</p> <p>\"In the 1990s under Clinton we were adding 300,000 jobs a month. We had very poor jobs growth under Bush,\" she said. \"The ratio of employed people to the population has been trending down since 2000.\"</p> <p>Stevenson said the hangover from the so-called \"jobless recovery\" after the previous recession and the depth of this recession had combined to leave a worrying legacy for the long-term unemployed.</p> <p>\"We are very much in danger of creating a large group of people who are never able to fully recover from this,\" she said.</p> <p>Stevenson has some direct knowledge of this. Her father, a pilot, has been unemployed for three years. Let go at age 60, he was not emotionally or financially ready for retirement. Officially he drops out of the long-term unemployment numbers because sometimes Stevenson hires him as a childminder. Like countless others he will not get counted in Friday's jobs report.</p> <p>Richard Chaifetz, founder and chairman of ComPsych, the world's largest provider of employee assistance programs, said unemployment was always a handicap for those seeking work, but never more so than in a recession.</p> <p>\"This is a buyers' market,\" he said. \"Employers can choose who they want and they assume that those people who are in work are more attractive prospective hires than those who are not.\"</p> <p>And there is a benefit for employers who choose people in jobs, he said. \"You have a verifiable track record. And in this job market, where you can readily replace a lot of your people, employers can assume that those people with jobs are good employees.\"</p> <p>For those without jobs, unemployment become a stigma that becomes increasingly hard to shift, he said. \"There is a direct relationship between the time you are out of work and the amount of time it takes to find a job,\" he said.</p> <p>Chaifetz said unemployment was \"psychologically devastating\" and saps the confidence of those affected. \"The longer it goes on, the more difficult things become,\" he said.</p> <p>Chaifetz best advice for job seekers? Don't get unemployed in the first place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/draft/interactivesaved/2012/5/2/1335992045304/205144/jobs/js/libs/excanvas.min.js\"> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/draft/interactivesaved/2012/5/2/1335992045304/205144/jobs/css/unemployment.css\" media=\"all\" /> \t<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/draft/interactivesaved/2012/5/2/1335992045304/205144/jobs/js/libs/excanvas.min.js\"></script>\t \t<script src='http://static.guim.co.uk/draft/interactivesaved/2012/5/2/1335992045304/205144/jobs/js/libs/jquery.flot.js' type=\"text/javascript\"></script> \t<script src='http://static.guim.co.uk/draft/interactivesaved/2012/5/2/1335992045304/205144/jobs/js/libs/jquery.flot.stack.js' type=\"text/javascript\"></script> \t<script src='http://static.guim.co.uk/draft/interactivesaved/2012/5/2/1335992045304/205144/jobs/js/libs/tabletop.js' type=\"text/javascript\"></script> \t<script src='http://static.guim.co.uk/draft/interactivesaved/2012/5/3/1336071667298/371225/unemployment.js' type=\"text/javascript\"></script> </figure>",

What is different is the scale of the problems that the long-term unemployed face. The long-term unemployment rate hit a high of 26% in June 1983. But jobs growth roared back after the early 1980s recession and wiped out long-term unemployment. This time, with the rate at 40% and the recovery in the jobs market still fragile, the long-term unemployed are being left behind. \"This recession has been over for years. Officially it started in December 2007 and ended in the Summer of 2009, and yet three years later we have unemployment over 8%,\" said John Schmitt at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Some commentators have claimed that the US is going through a structural shift and that unskilled workers are being left behind. Schmitt disagrees. If there was a shortage of skilled workers, those skilled workers would be enjoying a bidding war for their services. If it was about education, graduates wouldn't be suffering so badly, he says. Schmitt points to a Washington Post headline from 1935: \"Skilled workmen in demand despite vast unemployment.\" The subheading read: \"Technological progress has been so rapid during the depression that welders and other experts, idle since 1929, are outmoded.\" It wasn't true then and it isn't true now, Schmitt said. If he's right, the truth about America's long-term unemployment may be more mundane, but in many ways more horrific. There is very little that can be done for the long-term unemployed until the economy starts to recover. The US needs to create about 100,000 jobs a month to stand still and is about 10 million jobs down from where it was before the recession. On current trends it could take until the 2020s for unemployment to get back to 6-7%, a level that the Federal Reserve considers \"normal\". And the ones who are most likely to be last to get jobs are the ones who have been out of work the longest. 'I'd go to a lot of places and they'd tell me I was over-qualified' The plight of the long-term unemployed sparked the rise of its own protest group in 2010. The 99ers, named after those who had exhausted their 99 weeks of insurance benefits that they can claim, briefly became a hot political topic \u2013 hot enough to attract the ire of rightwing media stars like Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and would-be presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. \"It is fundamentally wrong to give people money for 99 weeks for doing nothing,\" Gingrich told a Republican debate in Orlando. No one talks about the 99ers now, says Jim Eichelberg, who still helps coordinate its Chicago chapter. Eichelberg is a former 99er but technically he is now no longer unemployed. A qualified mechanic, he works three days a week cooking and cleaning up at Doyle's Pub, a local bar near his home in Richmond, Illinois, for $8.25 an hour. It's all he can find. \"You mention 99ers today and people say 'what?'\", he said. \"The Hunger Games brought in $1.3bn in three weeks. This nation just wants to be entertained.\" Eichelberg, 54, worked on a farm until he was 40. He'd always worked with engines, and when the farm was sold he decided he'd better get a qualification to prove his expertise. He got a certification in automotive technology at a local college and found a job at Buell, the motorcycle company. After 9/11, the recession bit and he was laid off. Suddenly, he found his qualification was working against him. \"I'd go to a lot of places and they'd tell me I was over-qualified, that I'd get bored. So what! I don't mind. Just hire me,\" he says. \"What are you people looking for?\" He keeps looking for work but feels his age is working against him. \"I walk in with this salt-and-pepper beard and I think they look at me and think: no,\" he said. \"All the politicians say is that jobs are being created, that we created 120,000 jobs last month. Divide that over 50 states.\" More than that, argues Betsey Stevenson, professor of business and public policy at Wharton business school, the US has been creating fewer jobs even in the good times. \"In the 1990s under Clinton we were adding 300,000 jobs a month. We had very poor jobs growth under Bush,\" she said. \"The ratio of employed people to the population has been trending down since 2000.\" Stevenson said the hangover from the so-called \"jobless recovery\" after the previous recession and the depth of this recession had combined to leave a worrying legacy for the long-term unemployed. \"We are very much in danger of creating a large group of people who are never able to fully recover from this,\" she said. Stevenson has some direct knowledge of this. Her father, a pilot, has been unemployed for three years. Let go at age 60, he was not emotionally or financially ready for retirement. Officially he drops out of the long-term unemployment numbers because sometimes Stevenson hires him as a childminder. Like countless others he will not get counted in Friday's jobs report. Richard Chaifetz, founder and chairman of ComPsych, the world's largest provider of employee assistance programs, said unemployment was always a handicap for those seeking work, but never more so than in a recession. \"This is a buyers' market,\" he said. \"Employers can choose who they want and they assume that those people who are in work are more attractive prospective hires than those who are not.\" And there is a benefit for employers who choose people in jobs, he said. \"You have a verifiable track record. And in this job market, where you can readily replace a lot of your people, employers can assume that those people with jobs are good employees.\" For those without jobs, unemployment become a stigma that becomes increasingly hard to shift, he said. \"There is a direct relationship between the time you are out of work and the amount of time it takes to find a job,\" he said. Chaifetz said unemployment was \"psychologically devastating\" and saps the confidence of those affected. \"The longer it goes on, the more difficult things become,\" he said. Chaifetz best advice for job seekers? Don't get unemployed in the first place.",

Private equity firm buys ancient family-controlled company with reliable but slowly-growing earnings, injects massive financial leverage, collects a few dividends via further refinancings and then sells out several years later at a spectacular profit. This is indeed the story of Weetabix since Sir Richard George's family sold the 80-year-old firm to Lion Capital's predecessor, Hicks Muse, in 2004. The price paid then was \u00a3642m but Thursday's sale, in which Chinese state-owned firm Bright Food is buying a 60% stake, values the cereal maker at \u00a31.2bn. Lion and the management are retaining 40% but the private equity firm's aggressive use of debt (Weetabix has borrowings of about \u00a3900m) has allowed it to make a fivefold return on its original equity investment. Congratulations to Lyndon Lea, the party-loving partner at Lion who masterminded the investment. But you have to ask whether Bright Food, after several false starts for its European expansion plans, has been tempted into overpaying. Neither Lion nor Bright Food will provide up-to-date financial numbers for Weetabix. But the last set of accounts filed at Companies House for Latimer Group, a holding company, show a business running hard to stand still. \"2010 was another challenging year for the Weetabix Group,\" the report says, citing \"continuing fragile consumer confidence\" and \"a significantly increased level of promotional activity in the cereal sector\". Overall, operating profits improved only marginally from \u00a366.8m to \u00a367.6m \u2013 the UK was up a little; North America was down a little. Today's Bright Food deal, then, values Weetabix at about 18 times 2010's operating profits and more than three times its turnover of \u00a3423m in the same year. For comparison, the company made sales of \u00a3362m back in 2002 \u2013 so progress has been slow but steady, which is what one would expect in a business where consumers' tastes tend to shift only slowly. Bright Food's supporters counter that, actually, the price is more than reasonable. 2010, they say, was indeed a slow year but Weetabix returned to strong growth in 2011. What's more, they argue, it is a cash machine \u2014 a business with gross profit margins as high as 60%. On the basis of ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), it is said that Weetabix has improved from \u00a360m to more than \u00a3120m during Lion's ownership. Either way, part of Bright Food's bet is that the Chinese are about to fall in love with wheat biscuits \u2014 it says it wants to \"take advantage of the growing appetite in the country for packaged and convenient healthy foods\". It's the best judge of that, but it's worth recalling a comment by Sir Richard George himself about Weetabix's special status in British stomachs: \"Mothers tend to wean their children on Weetabix and people in Britain tend to grow up with an in-built liking for them. That's not the case in other countries \u2013 it's very hard to sell them in Germany for instance.\"",

      "bodyText": "The head of the European Central Bank has called on European leaders to embrace a growth pact that would end the youth unemployment crisis that it gripping the region, and breathe life into its struggling economy. Speaking after the ECB left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, Mario Draghi said he supported calls for a new strategy to stimulate economic growth in Europe. A key plank of that strategy must be to reform Europe's labour market, so that younger workers no longer bear the brunt of unemployment during a downturn. Draghi criticised the current European labour market, saying it is structured against young people. \"Distortions in the labour market have caused the youth sector of the labour market to be flexible while the rest of the labour market is fully protected,\" Draghi told a press conference in Barcelona. \"So when you have a situation that causes the unemployment rate to rise, it falls harder on young people.\" Efforts to reform Europe's employment laws have been met with resistance by unions, who fear employers taking advantage of the crisis to erode hard-won rights and protections. In Italy, prime minister Mario Monti has struggled to tear up laws that make it harder to fire workers. Monti's message that a more \"flexible\" labour market would mean more jobs for younger people was not well received, even by those who would benefit. But with youth unemployment in the eurozone hitting 21.4%, and over 50% in Spain and Greece, the situation appears to have reached a crisis. The idea of a European growth compact has gathered more support in recent weeks as economic data showed that the eurozone economy was weakening more than thought, with manufacturing output falling sharply in April. Draghi denied that the concept was at odds with the current fiscal compact, which focuses on driving down deficits through austerity measures, claiming that fiscal sustainability can be a pillar for growth. Thousands of police were deployed on the steets of Barcelona to guard against protests, although the only demonstrations were organised by Spanish students who held a peaceful anti-austerity march.

    "webTitle": "Aviva rocked by shareholder rebellion over executive pay", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Five major companies endured shareholder revolts over pay on Thursday \u2013 including insurer Aviva, which had its remuneration report voted down \u2013 in the latest sign that investors are taking a tough stance over underperforming companies. Aviva's chief executive, Andrew Moss, faced repeated calls to step down after 54% of shareholders voted against its remuneration policies, making the insurer only the fourth FTSE 100 company \u2013 after Royal Bank of Scotland, Shell and GlaxoSmithKline \u2013 to have its pay rejected in the 10 years since a vote was introduced. A hoarse-sounding Moss suffered a 10% vote against his re-election as a director, and several private shareholders bluntly called for him to go along with the outgoing chairman, Colin Sharman. Other companies also suffered protest votes , including satellite communications group Inmarsat where 40% failed to support the remuneration report, and household products group Reckitt Benckiser, Premier Foods and Carillion, the building and services group. In Switzerland, 37% of investors failed to back the pay policies of UBS and blocked a resolution that would have allowed the bank to issue shares to pay bonuses. But the level of dissent at Aviva was rare at close to 60% if deliberate abstentions are included. At an acrimonious annual meeting, investor Michael Mason-Mahon was concerned at the departure of respected executives Mark Hodges and Igal Mayer in the last year. \"When children start running away from home, you have to look at the parents, and you seem to be very bad parents, you and Mr Moss,\" he told the chairman. \"We no longer have confidence in Mr Moss as our CEO.\" Philip Meadowcroft, a shareholder and pension fund trustee, launched a withering attack on Moss's and Sharman's stewardship of the insurer since 2007. While revenues and profits had fallen by 19% and 16%, the dividend had slumped 21% and the share price 62%, total executive pay had \"ballooned by 90%\" and non-executive remuneration by 82%. \"This suggests our board members have been rather more concerned about their remuneration packages than growing our business.\" He accused the duo, along with five non-executive directors, of presiding over a \"massive year-by-year destruction of shareholder value\". Sharman retorted: \"I'm not prepared to accept responsibility for the banking crisis or for the European debt crisis. Both have had very significant impacts on the company.\" Meadowcroft shot back, addressing the board: \"But you have rewarded yourself considerably.\" Moss told shareholders: \"I care deeply about the Aviva share price and I am as frustrated about it as anybody in this room.\" Sharman is being succeeded in June by former RBS non-executive director John McFarlane, who will now have to repair relations with investors. Aviva, whose own fund management arm prides itself on its corporate governance stance, had attempted to head off a revolt with last-minute changes to its pay policies on Monday. Scott Wheway, chairman of Aviva's remuneration committee, conceded at the meeting: \"We could and should have done more to engage with shareholders.\" He and Sharman apologised formally to investors. Moss waived a 4.8% pay rise that would have pushed his basic salary through \u00a31m. But Robert Muriel, a private shareholder, described the \u00a346,000 waived as a \"joke\" in view of his total package, which is close to \u00a35m. He accused the company of frequent changes in strategy, to which Sharman responded, amid laughter from shareholders: \"It hasn't been chopped up, it's been refined.\" The company also promised to change its policies on \"golden hellos\" for new directors following the \u00a32.2m package it handed to Trevor Matthews, who joined as head of the UK business from Friends Life in November. Some shareholders criticised the incentive payment and his appointment. Aviva's woes came barely a week after Barclays also tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to stem a rebellion at its annual meeting. Some 31.5% of investors failed to back the Barclays pay report. Until this year, only 18 remuneration reports had received a protest vote greater than 50% in the 10 years since the vote on pay was introduced by the Labour government. Last week a small company, Central Rand Gold, suffered a rebellion by 75% of its investors.

      "body": "<p>Five major companies endured shareholder revolts over pay on Thursday \u2013 including insurer Aviva, which had its remuneration report voted down \u2013 in the latest sign that investors are taking a tough stance over underperforming companies.</p> <p>Aviva's chief executive, Andrew Moss, faced repeated calls to step down after 54% of shareholders voted against its remuneration policies, making the insurer only the fourth FTSE 100 company \u2013 after Royal Bank of Scotland, Shell and GlaxoSmithKline \u2013 to have its pay rejected in the 10 years since a vote was introduced. A hoarse-sounding Moss suffered a 10% vote against his re-election as a director, and several private shareholders bluntly called for him to go along with the outgoing chairman, Colin Sharman.</p> <p>Other companies also suffered protest votes , including <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201205031316586863C\" title=\"\">satellite communications group Inmarsat where 40% failed to </a>support the remuneration report, and household products group Reckitt Benckiser, Premier Foods and Carillion, the building and services group. In Switzerland, 37% of investors failed to back the pay policies of UBS and blocked a resolution that would have allowed the bank to issue shares to pay bonuses.</p> <p>But the level of dissent at Aviva was rare at close to 60% if deliberate abstentions are included. At an acrimonious annual meeting, investor Michael Mason-Mahon was concerned at the departure of respected executives Mark Hodges and Igal Mayer in the last year. \"When children start running away from home, you have to look at the parents, and you seem to be very bad parents, you and Mr Moss,\" he told the chairman. \"We no longer have confidence in Mr Moss as our CEO.\"</p> <p>Philip Meadowcroft, a shareholder and pension fund trustee, launched a withering attack on Moss's and Sharman's stewardship of the insurer since 2007. While revenues and profits had fallen by 19% and 16%, the dividend had slumped 21% and the share price 62%, total executive pay had \"ballooned by 90%\" and non-executive remuneration by 82%. \"This suggests our board members have been rather more concerned about their remuneration packages than growing our business.\" He accused the duo, along with five non-executive directors, of presiding over a \"massive year-by-year destruction of shareholder value\".</p> <p>Sharman retorted: \"I'm not prepared to accept responsibility for the banking crisis or for the European debt crisis. Both have had very significant impacts on the company.\" Meadowcroft shot back, addressing the board: \"But you have rewarded yourself considerably.\"</p> <p>Moss told shareholders: \"I care deeply about the Aviva share price and I am as frustrated about it as anybody in this room.\"</p> <p>Sharman is being succeeded in June by former RBS non-executive director John McFarlane, who will now have to repair relations with investors.</p> <p>Aviva, whose own fund management arm prides itself on its corporate governance stance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/30/aviva-boss-waives-pay-rise\" title=\"\">had attempted to head off a revolt</a> with last-minute changes to its pay policies on Monday. Scott Wheway, chairman of Aviva's remuneration committee, conceded at the meeting: \"We could and should have done more to engage with shareholders.\" He and Sharman apologised formally to investors.</p> <p>Moss waived a 4.8% pay rise that would have pushed his basic salary through \u00a31m. But Robert Muriel, a private shareholder, described the \u00a346,000 waived as a \"joke\" in view of his total package, which is close to \u00a35m. He accused the company of frequent changes in strategy, to which Sharman responded, amid laughter from shareholders: \"It hasn't been chopped up, it's been refined.\"</p> <p>The company also promised to change its policies on \"golden hellos\" for new directors following the \u00a32.2m package it handed to Trevor Matthews, who joined as head of the UK business from Friends Life in November. Some shareholders criticised the incentive payment and his appointment.</p> <p>Aviva's woes came barely a week after Barclays also tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to stem a rebellion at its annual meeting. Some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/27/barclays-agm-shareholder-anger\" title=\"\">31.5% of investors failed to back the Barclays pay report</a>. Until this year, only 18 remuneration reports had received a protest vote greater than 50% in the 10 years since the vote on pay was introduced by the Labour government. Last week a small company, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/30/website-public-anger-city-pay\" title=\"\">Central Rand Gold, suffered a rebellion by 75% of its investors.</a></p> <p>Alan MacDougall, managing director of shareholder advisory body Pirc said: \"[Aviva] is only the fourth FTSE 100 [company] to lose the vote on remuneration policy since it became mandatory 10 years ago.

So this was an absolutely textbook response to the situation.\" King backed the government as he defended himself against attacks on his record during the financial crisis, following his speech on Wednesday night. Interviewer Evan Davis said it was surprising the governor commented on politicial decision-making around the budget, only to be told by King that his counterparts around the world were more meddlesome than he had ever dared to be. He claimed he only commented on the overall shape of the budget when he was asked and never sought to involve himself or the bank in politics. King was criticised by the former chancellor Alistair Darling in 2010 by appearing to support Osborne and David Cameron after holding private talks days ahead of the election. Labour MP Andy Love, a Treasury Select Committee member, said after the interview: \"This is a very unwise intervention by the governor as voters go to the polls. \"He has been less than forthcoming about the Bank of England's mistakes in the run-up to the crash when it had a very clear responsibility for financial stability. \"And he is compromising his position by once again backing George Osborne's economic plan, even though we now know it has comprehensively failed and pushed Britain back into recession. But Conservative Party deputy chairman Michael Fallon agreed that the governor's speech was an attack on Labour's record in office. \"King has said Ed Balls' and Gordon Brown's decision to take the power to regulate the banks away from the Bank of England meant the financial crisis wasn't prevented. \"And he has backed the government's 'textbook' plan to deal with our debts and live within our means, rejecting Labour's plans for more spending, more borrowing and more debt \u2013 exactly how Ed Balls and Gordon Brown got us into this mess in the first place.\" The governor, who steps down next year after 10 years in office, also countered criticism that he failed to spot the banking crisis and was a barrier to rescuing banks when it became obvious they were in trouble during the summer of 2007. Davis said many experts accused him of being too academic and keener to moralise about the greed and mistakes made by bank bosses than to salvage the crucial sector of the economy. King said: \"I don't think I have been too academic. I think a knowledge of financial history is essential and I wish, if anything, I had turned to it earlier.\" He said he put the central bank's funds at the disposal of troubled banks, and that the collapse of the system was due to the insolvency of many banks, not the need for short-term loans.

    "webTitle": "UK service sector growth slows", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's crucial services sector lost momentum in April after growth slowed to a six month low, according to a survey. The Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) found that a healthy recovery in the sector over the winter months dropped from 55.3 in March to 53.3. The services sector accounts for three-quarters of business activity and is keenly watched by the Treasury as a bellwether of the UK and its likely recovery. Markit said it detected some strength in orders and sales that pointed to a modest rise in activity being sustained over the coming months. The firm's optimistic reading of the economy was supported earlier on Thursday by the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, who said reports from central bank's regional agents pointed to a recovery this year after 18 months of zero growth. However, figures from the Office for National Statistics last week contradicted the Markit PMIs by showing only a marginal rise in services activity of just 0.1 percentage points in the first three months of the year. It was partly the depressed state of the services sector, according to the official figures, that dragged Britain into its second recession in three years. The minutes of the Bank of England's most recent monetary policy committee (MPC) hinted that rising inflation and the strength of the PMIs had persuaded most members of its rate-setting committee to step back from more electronic money printing, or quantitative easing (QE). Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the Markit survey was consistent with reasonable services output growth of about 0.4% quarter on quarter. \"Although the official data have recently been weaker than the surveys, the MPC seems to be putting more weight on the latter. But April's falls in the survey suggest that any underlying pick-up in activity is fading anyway. The survey will therefore make for a slightly trickier decision at next week's MPC meeting. \"We still think that the recent stickiness of inflation will prompt the MPC to pause its QE programme, but if the recent weaker tone of the activity data continue, as we expect, more asset purchases are likely later in the year.\" Richard Driver, analyst for the currency broker Caxton FX, said while the PMI was the weakest UK services figure since last November, \"looking at the figure on a global scale, the sector is in truth performing pretty solidly\". He added: \"This week's PMI data as a whole demonstrates that the manufacturing, construction and services sectors are all above the all-important 50.0 mark, which is more than can be said of the eurozone. This slowdown is no cause for panic and the UK has a strong chance of bouncing back out of recession this quarter.\" However, Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said weakening PMIs for construction, manufacturing and services would raise the likelihood of the Bank of England injecting further stimulus into the economy. \"The strength of the surveys earlier in the year was seen as a key reason for the Bank's reluctance to expand its quantitative easing programme,\" he said. \"The Bank will also be concerned that, whether correct or not, the news from the official data that the country has fallen back into recession will have hit both business and consumer confidence. \"A deepening recession in the eurozone will have added to policymakers' concerns about the impact on the UK economy though lost export sales and a potentially worsening credit squeeze.\"",

Manchester, with its two top-flight football teams, ultra-modern landmark buildings such as the Lowry Centre, and state-of-the-art BBC media centre (which is open to tourists), clocked up 936,000 visits, up 15% on 2010. Birmingham was fourth with 732,000 overseas visitors, many of them attracted by its arts scene, exhibitions and the Bullring shopping centre. Liverpoolalso saw a 15% rise, to 545,000 visitors, overtaking Glasgow for fifth place. Oxford, in seventh place, was up 12%. Beyond the top 10, Leeds, Cardiff, Aberdeen, Windsor, Carlisle, Stratford-upon-Avon, Newquay, Harrogate and Cheltenham all experienced higher numbers of international visits than was the case in 2010. Visits to the south-east (excluding London) increased by 2%. The Isle of Wight saw an increase of 14%, achieving a record 62,000 visits from abroad. Patricia Yates, strategy and communications director for VisitBritain, said: \"These results confirm that international visitors who might come here because of the global appeal of London are starting to appreciate our vibrant cities outside the capital, and the very different offerings of Edinburgh, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester.\"",
