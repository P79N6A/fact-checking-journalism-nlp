      "bodyText": "That may be all for this evening; a chance to let the Guardian servers recuperate (sorry about the silence earlier, luckily we didn\u2019t miss much). I\u2019ll be back if anything major happens. In the meantime, enjoy Ian Traynor\u2019s latest piece on the crisis, on a day where relations between the two sides hit new depths... A new survey released tonight shows a small majority for the Yes side ahead of Sunday\u2019s referendum, but with a chunk of undecided voters to fight over. Another night, another protest march - this time in the city of Thessaloniki, by Greeks who will vote \u201cno\u201d on Sunday: Jeroen Dijsselbloem has now replied to Alexis Tsipras, to confirm that no talks can take place until after Sunday\u2019s vote (as he said earlier). Dijsselbloem also states that the result of that referendum will also be crucial in determining if talks can take place at all... In view of your letter, we would like to recall that on February 20 the Greek authorities agreed to reiterate their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and timely. Secondly, we will come back to your request for financial stability support from the ESM only after and on the basis of the outcome of the referendum. Some highlights from Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s appearance on ERT TV tonight: He has said the Greek people can give its creditors a clear message on Sunday, and that he then hopes to resume talks about a \u2018sustainable solution\u2019 on Monday. Varoufakis also denied that Greece could leave the euro - despite several European powers saying that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s at stake...... Greek twitter users are tweeting the key points: Before we wrap up, Greece\u2019s finance minister is giving a TV interview: Highlights to follow..... Instead of dealing a killer blow to the Greek banks tonight, the ECB has simply left them in limbo. They still can\u2019t reopen until the ELA limit is raised, and Mario Draghi is highly unlikely to do that before Sunday\u2019s referendum. It also appears that the European Central Bank has resisted imposing higher haircuts on the assets Greek banks hand over in return for emergency funds. Newsflash: An ECB spokesman has said that the central bank decided to maintain emergency lending to the Greek banking sector at its current level (hot off the Reuters terminal). That means it has maintained the \u20ac89bn cap which was imposed on Sunday, and which triggered the imposition of capital control. Belgium\u2019s finance minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, has told the Financial Times that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech rather upset the Eurogroup. That helps explain why they decided to break off talks until the referendum: The European Council has now uploaded the interview with Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, after today\u2019s conference call with eurozone finance ministers. And it confirms that the eurozone has slammed the door in Greece\u2019s face, at least until Monday. Dijsselbloem says that finance ministers simply took note of Greece\u2019s proposal today, and agreed that there can be no talks until Sunday\u2019s referendum has been held. The main decision was that given the political situation, the rejection of the previous proposals, the referendum which will take place on Sunday, and the \u201cno advice\u201d of the Greek government, we see no ground for further talks at this point. There will be no further talks in the coming days, neither at eurogroup level not between the Greek authorities and the institutions, on proposals or financial arrangements. We will simply wait now the outcome of the referendum on Sunday, and take into account the outcome of that referendum. Dijsselbloem adds that he is \u201cvery sorry about this situation\u201d, given the Greek people\u2019s strong determination to stay in Europe and the eurozone -- in which we fully support them. Europe\u2019s stock markets finished the day on a roll - with the FTSE 100 ending 87 points higher at 6608, up 1.34%. The French CAC jumped almost 2%, and the German DAX gained 2.1%. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says there was optimism that the Greek bailout saga might be resolved before too much longer: There was stifling heat in the City of London on Wednesday but stock markets weren\u2019t losing their cool over the crises in Greece. Greek prime minister Tsipras offered enough hope to spring a relief rally by suggesting Greece would meet most of the demands of its creditors in the most recent proposal. However, Greek banks remained closed while the European Central bank deliberated providing more emergency funding. Yes, come on Mario, the liveblog\u2019s working again now so no need to dawdle... Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has published a short\u2019n\u2019snappy bullet point list of reasons to vote no on Sunday. It includes the fact that Greece\u2019s debt is unsustainable and should be restructured, and a promise that a No vote won\u2019t lead to Greece leaving the euro. Greeks should say \u201ca big NO, he concludes. Here\u2019s why: Negotiations have stalled because Greece\u2019s creditors (a) refused to reduce our un-payable public debt and (b) insisted that it should be repaid \u2018parametrically\u2019 by the weakest members of our society, their children and their grandchildren The IMF, the United States\u2019 government, many other governments around the globe, and most independent economists believe \u2014 along with us \u2014 that the debt must be restructured. The Eurogroup had previously (November 2012) conceded that the debt ought to be restructured but is refusing to commit to a debt restructure Since the announcement of the referendum, official Europe has sent signals that they are ready to discuss debt restructuring. These signals show that official Europe too would vote NO on its own \u2018final\u2019 offer. Greece will stay in the euro. Deposits in Greece\u2019s banks are safe. Creditors have chosen the strategy of blackmail based on bank closures. The current impasse is due to this choice by the creditors and not by the Greek government discontinuing the negotiations or any Greek thoughts of Grexit and devaluation. Greece\u2019s place in the Eurozone and in the European Union is non-negotiable. The future demands a proud Greece within the Eurozone and at the heart of Europe. This future demands that Greeks say a big NO on Sunday, that we stay in the Euro Area, and that, with the power vested upon us by that NO, we renegotiate Greece\u2019s public debt as well as the distribution of burdens between the haves and the have nots. Why we recommend a NO in the referendum \u2013 in 6 short bullet points Greece\u2019s highest court in the land, the council of state, may have the last say in whether a referendum is held on Sunday after receiving an appeal from citizens for the vote to cancelled for being illegitimate on constitutional grounds. The tribunal has said it will consider the appeal - apparently made by two individuals - on Friday with a judgement expected later that day! An interview with Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem should be online soon. Apparently they\u2019re having some technical problems: Happens to the best of us.... The US government continues to put pressure on all sides to reach a deal. Reuters says: White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One the United States encouraged all parties to recognize the mutual interest they have in resolving the situation. In Athens this afternoon, pensioners have been queuing patiently at Greek banks to cash their retirement cheques: Many other people have made the pilgrimage to the ATM machines for their daily \u20ac60.  Excellent, we are up and running. So let\u2019s catch up with events in Brussels. The eurozone\u2019s finance ministers have, as flagged up, declined to discuss Greece\u2019s third bailout programme before Sunday\u2019s referendum. Talks are off, it appears, until the Greek people have had their say. And Eleni Varvitsiotis of the Kathimerini newspaper report that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s defiant address to the nation stunned Brussels insiders; any hopes that Greece\u2019s PM would blink and pull the referendum have been dashed. And we\u2019re back...( maybe ). Sorry for the unplanned downtime. It appears that Euro finance chiefs have decided that they will not consider Greece\u2019s request for a new loan before Sunday\u2019s vote has been held: Via Slovakia\u2019s finance minister: The letter is in the post: And while I\u2019m away, you can read the highlights of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech from the man himself: We\u2019re about to take a short break here, for technical reasons. So to quickly recap... Greece\u2019s prime minister has refused to bow to pressure from parts of the eurozone, and is pressing on with Sunday\u2019s referendum. In a televised address, Alexis Tsipras urged a No vote - saying this would strengthen his hand in negotiations with creditors for a third bailout. Those talks will resume on Monday, he insists. Elsewhere.... Eurozone finance ministers are due to hold a conference call in 30 minutes, to discuss Greece\u2019s application for a new loan. But Germany and Slovakia have already indicated that they are not willing to discuss the issue until Monday\u2019s referendum has been held. And the European Central Bank is poised to decide whether to continue providing emergency liquidity support to the Greek banking sector. Reminder, we do already know the framework of the deal Tsipras is now looking for, from the letter to creditors which emerged this morning. Alexis Tsipras also tried to calm fears over the financial crisis in Greece, with banks shuttered for the third day. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the speech: The Greek PM didn\u2019t appear to speak about the concessions he\u2019s now prepared to make to creditors. The Greek PM is showing no signs of backing down on holding a referendum on Sunday, reports Helena Smith from Athens. She is watching his address to the nation on live TV, and reports. \u201cAfter our proposal for a referendum better proposals have been put on the table,\u201d he declares, adding: \u201cI never expected a democratic Europe not to give space and time [to hold the referendum. It is a disgrace that we have these scenes of shame because they closed the banks precisely because we wanted to give the people the vote.\u201d \u201cNo does not mean rupture with Europe but return to a Europe with values,\u201dhe says. \u201cNo means strong pressure for an agreement of social justice, that will punish [those who promote] corruption.\u201d \u201cThey say I have a supposed plan that if you vote No I will take you out of Europe, they are wrong.\u201d The PM has also cited his European credentials: It\u2019s official - Tsipras is pressing on with Sunday\u2019s referendum, and is calling again for people to vote no. Tsipras says that a No vote is not a vote to leave Europe, but \u201ca return to European values.\u201d Tsipras appears to be insisting that the referendum is ON - he\u2019s explaining a popular mandate gives him more strength in negotiations. (but, which package are Greeks voting on? The one that died last night, or the one that\u2019s not been accepted yet?) We are still at the negotiating table, says Tsipras -- and if the Eurogroup meeting today delivers a positive message then we will move forward immediately. Tsipras is speaking about Sunday\u2019s referendum - the vote isn\u2019t about whether to stay in the euro or not, he insists. And the PM insists that creditors put \u201cbetter offers\u201d on the table once the referendum was announced. Finally, Greece\u2019s prime minister is speaking to the nation -- there\u2019s a live feed here (no translation though) Greece may be losing the support of some eurozone leaders, and the faith of the rating agencies, but it still has one ally -- Pope Francis. He has called on people to pray for the country, during its \u201c\u201ckeenly felt human and social crisis.\u201d In a statement, Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said: \u201cthe Holy Father wishes to convey his closeness to all the Greek people, with a special thought for the many families gravely beset by such a complex and keenly felt human and social crisis.\u201d (quotes via AP) And Archbishop Ieronymos, the leader of Greece\u2019s powerful Orthodox Church, has made an appeal for unity and calm. While the UK swelters, Greeks are suffering a dose of traditional British weather: Greece\u2019s finance minister insists he has nothing to do with the \u2018vote no\u2019 banner hanging on his office today: After hours of anticipation, Alexis Tsipras may begin giving his address shortly. And Channel 4\u2019s Paul Mason is hearing that he won\u2019t abandon Sunday\u2019s referendum.... The news of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s climbdown has sparked a rally on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq are both up 1% Europe is also on a tear too -- the FTSE 100 is up 107 points, or 1.6%. The German and French market have both surged around 2.5%, after two days of fairly chunky falls. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr has dropped a heavy hint that Greece should ditch Sunday\u2019s referendum if it wants to make progress on a third bailout: He\u2019s also warned that a No vote is a vote to leave the euro... Berlin and Paris don\u2019t seem to be on the same page regarding Greece: We\u2019re now waiting for three events.... Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech to the nation (time unknown), The European Central Bank\u2019s decision on emergency support for Greek banks (time unknown), and the Eurogroup teleconference (eurozone finance ministers) to discuss Greece\u2019s request for a third bailout (from 4.30pm BST/6.30pm Athens). Over in Athens, a banner reading \u201cNo to blackmail and austerity\u201d has been hung on the outside of the Finance Ministry: From Brussels, Jennifer Rankin sums up the situation: Germany has dismissed a last-ditch compromise plan from Greece that bowed to some key demands of its creditors. In an address to the Bundestag, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, reiterated her stance that there was no point in having talks with the government of Alexis Tsipras before a referendum in Greece on an EU bailout plan. \u201cThe door to talks with the Greek government has always been, and remains, open,\u201d she said, but added that talks could not take place before Sunday\u2019s poll. Her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, was fiercely critical of Tsipras, saying: \u201cGreece is in a difficult situation, but purely because of the behaviour of the Greek government \u2026 Seeking the blame outside Greece might be helpful inGreece, but it has nothing to do with reality. \u201cThe Greek government is not doing its people any favours at all if it keeps making completely false statements. Nobody else is to blame for their situation.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s all very sad. We\u2019re in a much harder situation than before. It was always difficult. But it has just kept getting more and more difficult since January [when Tsipras took over].\u201d... More here: Meanwhile French president Francois Hollande is making rather more conciliatory noises. Reuters again: [Hollande] said it was the duty of other euro zone countries as well as Greece to keep the country in the single currency area, adding that now was not the time for vetoes or \u201cintransigent statements\u201d but for dialogue. \u201cIt is our duty to keep Greece in the euro zone. That depends on Greece ... But it also depends on us. As a European I don\u2019t want the dislocation of the euro zone, I am not into intransigent comments, into brutal rifts,\u201d Hollande said. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 report on the attack on the Greek government by German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble: [Sch\u00e4uble] criticised the Greek government on Wednesday for doing nothing but renege on previous commitments since coming to power, saying the situation had \u201cworsened dramatically\u201d under Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. \u201cThis government has done nothing since it came into office,\u201d Schaeuble said in a speech in the lower house of parliament. \u201cIt has only reversed measures. It reneged on previously agreed commitments. It negotiated and negotiated. We don\u2019t know if the Greek government is going to hold a referendum or not, whether it is for or against it. You can\u2019t in all honesty expect us to talk with them in a situation like this. We need to wait to see what happens in Greece.\u201d Here\u2019s a couple of contributions from our GuardianWitness shout-out: ECB president Mario Draghi has said the overarching objective of the Greek bailout reforms was \u201csocial fairness\u201d, in a letter dated 30 June. Reuters snaps: 01-Jul-2015 13:28:38 - ECB\u2019S DRAGHI SAYS IN LETTER TO LAWMAKER REFORMS ALSO AIMED TO CREATE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH ALL CITIZENS PAY FAIR SHARE OF TAXES 01-Jul-2015 13:29:25 - ECB\u2019S DRAGHI SAYS IN LETTER TO LAWMAKER MEASURES ON GREEK PENSION SYSTEM DESIGNED TO BE PROGRESSIVE, HAVE BEEN MOSTLY APPLIED MAINLY TO PENSIONS ABOVE \u20ac1,000 01-Jul-2015 13:30:08 - ECB\u2019S DRAGHI SAYS IN LETTER TO LAWMAKER GOAL OF PENSION REFORM TO INCREASE ACTUARIAL FAIRNESS OF THE PENSION SYSTEM AND TO ENSURE THE SYSTEM\u2019S VIABILITY ALSO FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS Here\u2019s the full Associated Press story on the Council of Europe\u2019s comments on the Greek referendum: The head of the Council of Europe, Europe\u2019s top human rights institution, says Greece\u2019s referendum would fall short of international standards if held as planned on Sunday. Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjorn Jagland told The Associated Press that international standards recommend that a referendum be held with at least two weeks\u2019 notice to allow sufficient time for discussion, with a clear question put to the people and with international observers monitoring the vote. Greece\u2019s referendum on whether to accept creditor demands in return for bailout funds was called Saturday, and there has been confusion as to whether the result of a \u201cno\u201d vote as the government recommends would lead the country out of the 19-nation eurozone. The vote \u201chas been called on such a short notice, that this in itself is a major problem,\u201d Jagland said Wednesday by phone from Lisbon, Portugal. \u201cAnd also the fact that the questions that are put to the people ... are not very clear.\u201d Meanwhile German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble is continuing his defence in parliament of Germany\u2019s position on Greece: Ah... News that the Greek prime minister has finally accepted its creditors\u2019 terms (albeit with a few conditions) has been met with fury on the left in Greece, reports Helena Smith: Before Alexis Tsipras has even made his much anticipated address to the nation - explaining the details of the proposal - the country\u2019s communist party has described the deal as \u201cthe worst bailout\u201d ever. \u201cThey are shamefully fooling the Greek people. This proves that their \u201cno\u201d is in fact a \u201cyes\u201d to new loan accords that go against the people,\u201d the party\u2019s leader Dimitris Koutsoumbas railed in a statement. \u201cWe will cancel all of this,\u201d he said referring to Sunday\u2019s referendum. We will say no to the memoranda [bailout accords] , yes to resistance.\u201d The anti-capitalist bloc, Antarsya also issued a blistering attack on the government, saying whatever it was called the accord amounted to a third bailout that would further impoverish Greeks. \u2018The negotiations of submission between the government and the troika have to stop now,\u201d said the far left group adding that the time had come to break with the European Union and write off the country\u2019s debt altogether. \u201cThe no [that we will say] to the troika\u2019s black proposal for a new heavier round of bailout pillaging, is at the same time a heavy no to the continuous proposals of a government that is continually accepting ever more hard-hitting bailout terms that in reality serve the supporters of yes.\u201d Both statements highlight just how difficult it will be for the left-led coalition to enforce any agreement that is reached with creditors. Meanwhile bookmaker Paddy Power has paid out early - a five figure sum no less - to those who bet Greece would vote yes in Sunday\u2019s referendum. It said: At the time of paying out, the bookie was offering odds of 2/7 that the Greeks would pass the referendum. Since the market opened on Monday the bookie has seen one way traffic in the betting with over 85% of all money staked in favour that the result would pass. Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel is not having it all her own way in parliament: So what will Alexis Tsipras say in his television address? There is growing speculation he might actually cancel the referendum (as Helena Smith suggested earlier). According to the Wall Street Journal: Merkel is also saying the International Monetary Fund - which did not receive the \u20ac1.5bn owed by Greece by last night\u2019s deadline - would have to be part of any further talks. German chancellor Angela Merkel has said there will be no negotiations on a new bailout for Greece before Sunday\u2019s referendum. She said that, just as the Greeks have a right to hold a referendum, the other 18 euro countries have a right to react and have an opinion. And she said the door for talks with Greece was and remains open, although Greece has not fulfilled its obligations and with the expiration of the second bailout programme, the last Eurogroup proposals also expired. EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis has said it will present an analysis of the Greece\u2019s ESM loan request to the Eurogroup (via Reuters:) 01-Jul-2015 11:55:18 - EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS EU STANDS BY GREEK PEOPLE AND DOORS TO NEGOTIATIONS OPEN 01-Jul-2015 11:55:35 - EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS WHATEVER HAPPENS IN GREECE, EURO ZONE CAN WEATHER IT 01-Jul-2015 11:55:47 - EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS EU READY TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ENSURE FINANCIAL STABILITY 01-Jul-2015 11:56:28 - EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS ECB MAKING FULL USE OF TOOLS TO ENSURE PRICE STABILITY 01-Jul-2015 11:57:34 - EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS COMMISSION TODAY SAW STRONG CASE TO ACCELERATE BANKING UNION 01-Jul-2015 12:01:42 - EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS GREEK GOVT REQUESTED ESM 2-YEAR LOAN, DEBT RESTRUCTURING, EXTENSION OF EFSF PROGRAMME 01-Jul-2015 12:02:39 - EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS EUROGROUP OPEN TO DISCUSSION ON DEBT RELIEF, AS SET OUT IN 2012 01-Jul-2015 12:03:42 - EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS WILL LOOK AT POSSIBLE NEW ESM PROGRAMME FOR GREECE 01-Jul-2015 12:04:09 - EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS COMMISSION WILL PRESENT ANALYSIS OF ESM LOAN REQUEST FROM GREECE TO EUROGROUP WEDNESDAY The Greek government has issued a statement on the Tsipras letter. Helena Smith reports from Athens: \u201cThe Greek yesterday delivered a new proposal to the institutions accompanied by a letter of prime minister Alexis Tsipras. Reports that say the Greek government has fully accepted the institutions\u2019 proposal do not stand,\u201d said the statement, adding that the government\u2019s proposal had included \u201ca series of amendments to the institutions\u2019 text.\u201d The new proposal was an attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement that not only gave emphasis to growth but making the country\u2019s monumental debt load viable, the government insisted. \u201cSeveral measures that the institutions are suggesting will not be enforced immediately but in stages so that the government can find equivalent measures to replace them,\u201d it said. And another word or two from Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble, who is really not very happy: Greece\u2019s non-payment of \u20ac1.5bn to the International Monetary Fund will not affect the ability of the eurozone bailout fund (the EFSF) to pay its bondholders. But it added that the non-payment could be a default for certain EFSF loans, and it was still analysing the situation. Here\u2019s the full EFSF statement: The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) takes note of a public statement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that a Greek non-payment has occurred. It is the EFSF\u2019s understanding that the IMF Managing Director has informed the IMF Executive Board. This will be confirmed by a meeting of the Executive Board, expected later today. For the EFSF, this would constitute an event of default for certain EFSF loans. The EFSF also takes note of the fact that the IMF received a request yesterday from the Greek authorities for an extension of Greece\u2019s repayment obligation that fell due yesterday. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board intends to examine this request in due course. In line with EFSF guidelines, EFSF CEO Klaus Regling must inform the chairman of the Eurogroup Working Group and the EFSF Board of Directors today of the non-payment and propose one of the following three options: acceleration of the loan: this means that the EFSF cancels the loan contract and requests immediate repayment of the principal and interest amounts; waiver of rights: this means that the EFSF irrevocably waives its right and remedies under the loan for this specific non-payment; reservation of rights: this means that the EFSF neither accelerates the loan nor waives its right to do so, but instead reserves the right to act at a later stage. The EFSF will coordinate its next steps very closely with the Eurogroup Working Group, where its shareholders are represented, and with the European Commission and the IMF. The Greek non-payment has no influence on the EFSF\u2019s capacity to repay its bondholders. Investors know that EFSF bonds benefit from a very strong guarantee structure. And back at EC president Juncker\u2019s press conference, an enterprising soul tackles Greece again, asking for a comment on the day\u2019s events. Juncker just says: I am in permanent contact with Greece and the other authorities.

Bloomberg reports: There are three scenarios, and it concludes that under the first two there are \u201cno sustainability issues\u201d when the country\u2019s financing needs are taken into account. The translation, though, provided by the Foreign Ministry and sent to reporters on Monday, missed out the word \u201cno.\u201d Full story: Here\u2019s one \u2018no\u2019 the Greek government should have looked after From our Europe editor: This may perhaps be easier to read: And the letter, courtesy Bloomberg: A Greek official has told Reuters that Alexis Tsipras asked to keep tax breaks for islands and wanted some changes to the contentious credit proposals. The FT earlier reported that Tsipras asked for a 30% discount on VAT for Greek islands, and requested that a plan to raise the retirement age to 67 by 2022 begin in October rather than at once. And here comes German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble to poor some cold water on things: 01-Jul-2015 10:46:58 - GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS NOTHING CHANGED IN FACT THAT THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT BETWEEN GREECE, CREDITORS BY MIDNIGHT 01-Jul-2015 10:51:07 - GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS OLD EFSF PROGRAMME FOR GREECE HAS EXPIRED, NOW A NEW ESM PROGRAMME WOULD BE NEEDED WITH DIFFERENT CONDITIONS 01-Jul-2015 10:52:35 - GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS THERE IS NO BASIS TO HAVE SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS WITH GREECE AT MOMENT 01-Jul-2015 10:52:57 - GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS GREECE HAS TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT IT WANTS (snaps courtesy Reuters) Whether Alexis Tsipras\u2019 new proposals are enough to satisfy Greece\u2019s creditors, however, is still in question: The precarious position of Greece could pose a risk to the financial system, the Bank of England said on Wednesday as it pledged to step in to insulate the UK from any shock waves caused by any worsening of the crisis in the eurozone. Setting out its half-yearly assessment of the risks to the UK financial system, the Bank of England said that the outlook for the risks in financial system had remained unchanged over the last six months until the dramatic events of the last few days when Greece closed its banks and then failed to repay a loan to the International Monetary Fund. The Bank said it had been working with the Treasury, the Financial Conduct Authority and European counterparts to put in place contingency plans to tackle the situation in Greece, which has crystallised in recent days but been a focus for policy makers for the last five years. \u201cThe UK authorities will continue to monitor developments and will take actions required to safeguard financial stability in the United Kingdom,\u201d the report said. It did not immediately provide any information about the contingency arrangements. The report was compiled after the latest quarterly meeting of the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), set up in the wake of the banking crisis to try to look for potential bombshells which could impact the UK\u2019s financial stability. It met last week \u2013 before Greece missed its crucial debt repayment \u2013 but at the time had regarded the risk from Greece to the financial system as \u201cparticularly acute\u201d. The Bank is concerned that the Greek situation could force investors to reconsider the risks of other investment they hold, which in turn could make liquidity in markets dry up, making it harder to buy and sell financial products. \u201cThe situation remains fluid. The FPC will continue to monitor developments and remains alert to the possibility that a deepening of the Greek crisis could prompt a broader reassessment of risk in financial markets,\u201d the report said.

The report about Greek concessions has sent markets climbing: Here\u2019s a taster of the FT story: Alexis Tsipras will accept all his bailout creditors\u2019 conditions that were on the table this weekend with only a handful of minor changes, according to a letter the Greek prime minister sent late Tuesday night and obtained by the Financial Times. The two-page letter, sent to the heads of the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank, elaborates on Tuesday\u2019s surprise request for an extension of Greece\u2019s now-expired bailout and for a new, third \u20ac29.1bn rescue, writes Peter Spiegel. Although the bailout\u2019s expiry at midnight Tuesday night means the extension is no longer on the table, Mr Tsipras\u2019 new letter could serve as the basis of a new bailout in the coming days. Full story here (\u00a3). BREAKING: The Financial Times is reporting that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras now appears to be conceding ground in an attempt to get a deal done: (This presumably is the new proposal now being considered) Over in Athens this morning there are growing murmurings among members of the governing Syriza party that following its latest bailout proposal to creditors the government should now change tack on Sunday\u2019s referendum. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Is prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led government having a change of heart about the referendum? Although the Greek parliament closed today \u2013 in line with the constitution ahead of the plebiscite \u2013 there is mounting speculation that the radical left Syriza party may indeed be having second thoughts. Last night, the deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis, in an interview with state-run TV, appeared to suggest that the referendum could be revoked, saying it was ultimately a \u201cpolitical issue.\u201d This morning the prominent Syriza party euro MP Dimitris Papadimoulis has pushed thoughts of change a little further, saying the government\u2019s proposal of a third bailout with debt restructuring \u201cchanges the landscape\u201d to the point that Greeks should now be urged to vote yes. \u201cThe government proposal for an agreement, without the IMF and with a solution for debt, changes the landscape,\u201d Papadimoulis wrote in a tweet. \u201cNow a Yes is urgently required to the proposal \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018out\u2019.\u201d Athens\u2019 anti-austerity coalition government has urged Greeks to vote \u201cno\u201d to the terms under which the debt-choked country would be given aid (terms that following the expiry of its bailout programme last night and the failure of a new accord, do not paradoxically formally exist, hence the widely held belief that the real dilemma posed by the referendum is whether Greeks want to remain in the euro or not). The MEP subsequently tried to clarify his stance in a second tweet writing: \u201cYes is for the government proposals. Not for the referendum. It is the hour of responsibility of all.\u201d Last night, the Greek parliament\u2019s president Zoe Konstantopoulou announced that it would be impossible, constitutionally, to revoke the ballot now that the 300-seat House had voted for it to be held. The UK manufacturing PMI for June has come in below expectations, and is the weakest for more than two years: China has called for talks between Greece and its creditors to continue. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing that China wanted to see a united European Union and a strong euro: \u201cSo we hope that the relevant creditors can keep talking with Greece to try and reach agreement as soon as possible and appropriately resolve the crisis now faced. \u201cFrom China\u2019s point of view we hope to see that the EU and eurozone can appropriately resolve this issue and Greece can continue to remain in the eurozone. This accords with the interests or all sides. China will continue to play a constructive role in this regard.\u201d Chinese premier Li Keqiang said during a visit to Brussels this week that China would continue to buy eurozone debt. (Report from Reuters) There has been a fairly muted response to the latest Greek developments in the bond markets, with Italian and Spanish bond yield dipping slightly as investors continued to hope for a deal to keep Greece inside the eurozone. Greek two year and ten year bond yields have edged up slightly but five year yields are currently unchanged. German chancellor Angela Merkel and her colleagues are set to debate Greece later in parliament: Here\u2019s a round-up of the other purchasing managers indices for June. First Spain: France: Germany: And the eurozone figure: Here\u2019s a link to the full Markit report on Greece\u2019s June PMI:\uf0a7 Downturn in manufacturing sector gathers pace Greek manufacturing activity shrank for the 10th month in a row, according to the latest purchasing managers index. The Markit index fell to 46.9, with a sharp decline in export orders and production (a reminder than anything below 50 indicates contraction). Markit economist Phil Smith said: \u201cThe accelerated contraction in goods production in June ended the worst quarter for the Greek manufacturing sector for two years. \u201cWith negotiations over a debt deal ongoing in June, demand was subdued, leading new orders - both from domestic and international clients - to fall even faster than in May.\u201d Here\u2019s the latest update from my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels: Greece is waiting to hear whether it will be granted emergency aid from the European Central Bank, as it scrambles to pay wages and pensions without the financial lifeline of an EU bailout. The country is insolvent and almost bankrupt after five years of \u20ac240bn (\u00a3170bn) in European bailouts dried up at the stroke of midnight and it became the first EU member to default on its creditors. On Tuesday, Greece missed a deadline to make a \u20ac1.5bn payment to the International Monetary Fund, dealing a historic blow to a Europe committed to the irreversibility of its 16-year-old single currency. Attention is turning to the ECB, which has poured \u20ac89bn into the Greek financial system in recent months to keep banks afloat. The Greek government will be waiting to hear whether the ECB will extend this credit line when the bank\u2019s decision-making governing council meets later on Wednesday in Frankfurt, Germany. Italy\u2019s finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan said the eurozone was still open to reaching a debt deal with Greece, and the country\u2019s debt profile was less worrying than it was often portrayed. Reuters reports: Irrespective of whether a deal was reached, policymakers needed to speed up plans for a closer integration of the currency bloc, starting with its banks, he told BBC radio. Last-minute overtures on Tuesday from Greece to its international creditors for financial aid were not enough to save it from becoming the first developed economy to default on an International Monetary Fund loan. That did not mean euro zone finance ministers had closed the door to a deal, Padoan said. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, as far as my colleagues in (the) Eurogroup are concerned, there\u2019s always a deal open (for Greece),\u201d Padoan said \u201cThe debt profile of Greece is much less worrying than ...is often portrayed. What Greece needs is to return to growth, and to return to growth Greece needs confidence, credit and especially structural measures.\u201d A weaker currency would clearly not help Greece, and if the country were to end up exiting the euro, the currency bloc would become \u201ca different animal\u201d that would need to keep its focus on closer integration. \u201cAt this stage whatever happens we need to accelerate integration and institution building in the euro area starting from a deeper banking union,\u201d Padoan said. UK chancellor George Osborne has said it is vital to resolve the current uncertainty over Greece and to ensure economic and financial stability across Europe, whatever the result of Sunday\u2019s referendum (which may European leaders are calling a choice between Greece staying in the eurozone or leaving). In a statement Osborne said: Britain\u2019s attitude to this developing crisis is clear: we hope for the best; but we prepare for the worst, and we stand ready to do whatever is necessary to protect our economic security at this uncertain time. Here\u2019s more on the Eurogroup change from Reuters: Eurozone finance ministers will hold a Eurogroup conference call on Greece at 1530 GMT on Wednesday, pushing it back by six hours at the request of several ministers, the group\u2019s spokesman said. Some ministers had scheduling clashes with the meeting, called on Tuesday evening following a similar call after Greece requested a new loan. Ministers are expected to review in more detail a letter from Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Change of plan. The Eurogroup teleconference will now start six hours later than originally proposed, now at 15.30 GMT. The Eurogroup spokesman has tweeted: (That 5.30 is Brussels time which is two hours ahead of GMT) Here\u2019s an updated version of Greece\u2019s debt deadlines: As expected, European markets have opened higher: 01-Jul-2015 08:00:34 - EUROPE\u2019S FTSEUROFIRST 300 RISES 0.5 PCT TO 1,517.50 POINTS IN EARLY TRADING 01-Jul-2015 08:01:04 - BRITAIN\u2019S FTSE 100 UP 0.8 PCT, FRANCE\u2019S CAC 40 UP 0.9 PCT 01-Jul-2015 08:01:15 - SPAIN\u2019S IBEX UP 0.8 PCT 01-Jul-2015 08:03:17 - GERMANY\u2019S DAX UP 1.0 PCT 01-Jul-2015 08:06:38 - EURO STOXX 50 UP 0.8 PCT (via Reuters) Speaking of Greece\u2019s banks, around 1000 of them have reopened to allow pensioners without ATM cards to cash up to \u20ac120 from their retirement cheques. They are being given numbered tickets in an attempt to make the process easier. And here is what people have been more used to seeing since Monday\u2019s closures and capital controls: Greece\u2019s referendum on Sunday to vote on whether to accept or reject the creditors\u2019 bailout terms (even though they are not now on the table after yesterday) is getting closer, according to the latest poll. Reuters reports: A majority of Greeks would vote No to the terms of a proposed bailout deal by foreign lenders but the lead narrowed significantly after banks were closed this week, according to an opinion poll published on Wednesday. The poll, by the ProRata institute published in the Efimerida ton Syntatkton newspaper, showed 54% of those planning to vote would oppose the bailout against 33% in favour. However a breakdown of results between those polled before and after Sunday\u2019s decision to close the banks and impose capital controls showed the gap narrowing. Of those polled before the announcement of the bank closures, 57% said they would vote No against 30% for who would vote Yes. However of those polled after, the No\u2019s were at only 46% against 37% Yes. It being the first day of the month, it is the usual round of manufacturing PMI data from around the world. China has already reported sluggish factory activity and in Europe, Italy and Spain are expected to remain strong, with France and Germany a little softer. In the UK, the PMI survey is expected to show a pickup in June to 52.6 from 52 the previous month, and in the US, the ISM manufacturing survey is forecast to improve from 52.8 to 53.2. Asian markets have edged higher awaiting the next developments now Greece\u2019s bailout has run out: And here are IG\u2019s opening calls for European markets, showing an early rebound is expected after yesterday\u2019s late declines: It\u2019s the morning after the historic night before, and Greece and its creditors are considering their next steps after the country failed to make a \u20ac1.5bn payment due to the International Monetary Fund, pushing it closer to default, and its bailout ran out without agreement. The Eurogroup is holding at teleconference at 10.30am BST to discuss Greece\u2019s request for a third bailout, after the country asked for a new two year programme under the European Stability Mechanism (Europe\u2019s bailout fund). But eurozone finance ministers have already warned such a path would be difficult, and France\u2019s finance minister Michel Sapin said it would be \u201cincredibily complicated\u201d, especially with the looming Greek referendum on Sunday. As Reuters reports: 01-Jul-2015 06:50:24 - FRANCE\u2019S FINMIN SAYS GOAL FOR FRANCE IS TO FIND A DEAL BEFORE THE REFERENDUM IN GREECE 01-Jul-2015 06:51:31 - FRENCH FINMIN SAYS OBVIOUSLY INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED TO GET DEAL WITH GREECE 01-Jul-2015 06:52:04 - FRENCH FINMIN SAYS TOUGHEST LINE IS AMONG SMALL EU COUNTRIES 01-Jul-2015 06:55:37 - FRENCH FINMIN MICHEL SAPIN SAYS NO VOTE BRINGS RISK OF MOVE TOWARDS GREEK EXIT OF EURO ZONE Meanwhile the European Central Bank is meeting - believed to be around 11.00 BST - to discuss whether to continue providing emergency support to Greek banks. The fact that a third bailout is being discussed might give the ECB the necessary cover to continue support albeit with perhaps tougher terms on collateral. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The European Central Bank will meet to assess the latest ELA arrangements which could well be tightened in light of yesterday\u2019s non-payment to the IMF. While it is not expected that the ECB will end the program, they could well raise the collateral haircuts, in exchange for emergency funding. There is a risk that this might place more strain on the weaker members of the Greek banking system and tip some of the weaker banks over the edge, leaving the ECB open to the accusation of further asphyxiating liquidity as well as political interference, which leaves it in a tricky position, and suggests that they will probably err on the side of caution and do nothing. As guardian of financial stability the sensible option would be to do nothing, despite further ratings agency downgrades for Greece last night, this time from Fitch to one rank above default. For those wanting to catch up with yesterday\u2019s events, here is our report: And here is the story from my colleague Alberto Nardelli on secret documents showing the full extent of Greece\u2019s debt problems: Greece would face an unsustainable level of debt by 2030 even if it signs up to the full package of tax and spending reforms demanded of it, according to unpublished documents compiled by its three main creditors.",

Here\u2019s why:</p> <ol> <li>Negotiations have stalled because Greece\u2019s creditors (a) refused to reduce our un-payable public debt and (b) insisted that it should be repaid \u2018parametrically\u2019 by the weakest members of our society, their children and their grandchildren</li> <li>The IMF, the United States\u2019 government, many other governments around the globe, and most independent economists believe \u2014 along with us \u2014 that the debt must be restructured.</li> <li>The Eurogroup had previously (November 2012) conceded that the debt ought to be restructured but is refusing to commit to a debt restructure</li> <li>Since the announcement of the referendum, official Europe has sent signals that they are ready to discuss debt restructuring. These signals show that official Europe too would vote NO on its own \u2018final\u2019 offer.</li> <li>Greece will stay in the euro. Deposits in Greece\u2019s banks are safe. Creditors have chosen the strategy of blackmail based on bank closures.

It did not immediately provide any information about the contingency arrangements.</p> <p>The report was compiled after the latest quarterly meeting of the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), set up in the wake of the banking crisis to try to look for potential bombshells which could impact the UK\u2019s financial stability. It met last week \u2013 before Greece missed its crucial debt repayment \u2013 but at the time had regarded the risk from Greece to the financial system as \u201cparticularly acute\u201d.</p> <p>The Bank is concerned that the Greek situation could force investors to reconsider the risks of other investment they hold, which in turn could make liquidity in markets dry up, making it harder to buy and sell financial products.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation remains fluid. The FPC will continue to monitor developments and remains alert to the possibility that a deepening of the Greek crisis could prompt a broader reassessment of risk in financial markets,\u201d the report said.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5593adf9e4b07edb74969c34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-01T09:36:08.431Z\">10.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Call out: if you\u2019re affected by what\u2019s going on in Greece we\u2019d like to hear from you.

Last night, the deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis, in an interview with state-run TV, appeared to suggest that the referendum could be revoked, saying it was ultimately a \u201cpolitical issue.\u201d</p> <p>This morning the prominent Syriza party euro MP Dimitris Papadimoulis has pushed thoughts of change a little further, saying the government\u2019s proposal of a third bailout with debt restructuring \u201cchanges the landscape\u201d to the point that Greeks should now be urged to vote yes. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f95b8aeb4a7bac3a559e0fde306b8d34800a520e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f95b8aeb4a7bac3a559e0fde306b8d34800a520e/79_111_2818_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Papadimoulis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"511\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Papadimoulis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Dabkowski/dpa/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe government proposal for an agreement, without the IMF and with a solution for debt, changes the landscape,\u201d Papadimoulis wrote in a tweet. \u201cNow a Yes is urgently required to the proposal \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018out\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Athens\u2019 anti-austerity coalition government has urged Greeks to vote \u201cno\u201d to the terms under which the debt-choked country would be given aid (terms that following the expiry of its bailout programme last night and the failure of a new accord, do not paradoxically formally exist, hence the widely held belief that the real dilemma posed by the referendum is whether Greeks want to remain in the euro or not). </p> <p>The MEP subsequently tried to clarify his stance in a second tweet writing: \u201cYes is for the government proposals. Not for the referendum. It is the hour of responsibility of all.\u201d </p> <p>Last night, the Greek parliament\u2019s president Zoe Konstantopoulou announced that it would be impossible, constitutionally, to revoke the ballot now that the 300-seat House had voted for it to be held. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-01T08:51:47.858Z\">at 9.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5593a626e4b075e173d532ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-01T08:35:56.084Z\">9.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The UK manufacturing PMI for June has come in below expectations, and is the weakest for more than two years</strong>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOREXcom/statuses/616162336928346112\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Manufacturing?src=hash\">#Manufacturing</a> PMI misses, coming in at 51.4 versus 52.6 expected.

The fact that a third bailout is being discussed might give the ECB the necessary cover to continue support albeit with perhaps tougher terms on collateral. Michael Hewson<strong>, </strong>chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The European Central Bank will meet to assess the latest ELA arrangements which could well be tightened in light of yesterday\u2019s non-payment to the IMF. While it is not expected that the ECB will end the program, they could well raise the collateral haircuts, in exchange for emergency funding.</p> <p> There is a risk that this might place more strain on the weaker members of the Greek banking system and tip some of the weaker banks over the edge, leaving the ECB open to the accusation of further asphyxiating liquidity as well as political interference, which leaves it in a tricky position, and suggests that they will probably err on the side of caution and do nothing.</p> <p> As guardian of financial stability the sensible option would be to do nothing, despite further ratings agency downgrades for Greece last night, this time from Fitch to one rank above default.</p> </blockquote> <p>For those wanting to catch up with yesterday\u2019s events, here is our report:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/eurozone-emergency-greece-without-financial-lifeline\">Greek failure to make IMF payment deals historic blow to eurozone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed\"> here</a></strong> is the story from my colleague Alberto Nardelli on secret documents showing the full extent of Greece\u2019s debt problems:</p> <blockquote> <p>Greece would face an unsustainable level of debt by 2030 even if it signs up to the full package of tax and spending reforms demanded of it, according to unpublished documents compiled by its three main creditors.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-01T13:56:24.330Z\">at 2.56pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "The birth of the UK\u2019s latest high street discounter began with a pram raid on Wednesday morning as young mums surged through the doors of Pep&amp;Co\u2019s first store in Kettering, Northamptonshire. About 100 people queued up outside the modest clothing and homeware store, hoping to get their hands on \u00a31 school polo shirts, \u00a32 bras and \u00a34 ballet shoes. It was no surprise, perhaps, that on a midweek morning just after the school run the majority of shoppers were wheeling buggies. It must also have been reassuring, however, for the Asda veteran Andy Bond and his colleagues, who have built Pep&amp;Co\u2019s strategy around attracting young mothers. \u201cThis is just one store on one day,\u201d said Adrian Mountford, the chain\u2019s managing director, a former Sainsbury\u2019s and Matalan executive. \u201cSo in some ways it doesn\u2019t mean a lot. But it would have meant a lot if there was no one here.\u201d Bond and his team aim to open 50 stores within eight weeks, backed to the tune of \u00a320m by the South African retail tycoon Christo Wiese, who recently bought the New Look chain. The next opening will be in Cwmbran, south Wales, in a fortnight, followed by Falkirk in Scotland, Corby in Northamptonshire, and Hull. The following week six stores will open, then 10 a week until the target is hit. It is a hectic schedule which retail old-timers say has not been matched since 1982, when George Davies launched Next with six stores in one day and 70 within five and a half months. \u201cEveryone we talk to wants to call us mad for trying,\u201d said Bond. \u201cBut that bloke that said the world was not flat, he was thought a bit mad at the time.\u201d Shoppers seemed to be testing out the store\u2019s catchline, \u201cspend a little get a lot\u201d, as queues formed quickly at the tills, which took \u00a31,000 in less than an hour. Bond said Pep&amp;Co would easily exceed its first day target. The nascent chain is entering a crowded market against giant competitors including Tesco, Asda and Primark. Bond insisted there was a gap for a high street shop that focuses on mothers, with more children\u2019s wear than rivals such as Peacocks. In Kettering there was no question of the message Pep&amp;Co hopes to get across. The main window is dominated by 6ft lime-green 3D numbers marking out deals from \u00a31 to \u00a36. Inside the store, so-called \u201cround pound\u201d simple prices are clearly flagged above tables and racks stacked with plenty of clothes. One shopper said her mother had sent her to check out the prices on nightwear and underwear, but ended up filling a basket. She was planning to come back later for some candles and other homewares. Cayla Woods, a mother and grandmother who had picked up school uniform items and underwear, said: \u201cThe price on everything looks good and with the quality of the clothes you can\u2019t go wrong. I think the quality of the T-shirts is better than in Asda or Tesco where I usually shop.\u201d One repeated complaint on the hottest day of the year so far was that there was not enough summer wear. \u201cI like the boots,\u201d said one shopper. \u201cBut who wants to wear those now?\u201d Another complained there were no shorts for boys. If the hot weather lasts, it could make things more tricky for Pep&amp;Co\u2019s first few weeks. The chain\u2019s launch comes at the end of the traditional summer season for retailers, when most are already discounting their summer stock Bond said the telling moment would be after Pep&amp;Co had completed its first season, with a Christmas under its belt. He said that after Wiese\u2019s Pepkor had backed the initial openings, the business should be able to f inance further stores itself, but he did not rule out returning to Pepkor for more funds. \u201cWe will review it and decide if we want to go faster or slower,\u201d he said.",

But an 11% increase in the second quarter of this year took the price to the new high, according to a report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Overall, the average price of a New York City apartment in 2014 was $1.7m. That in itself was a record high. \u201cIt\u2019s like everyone revved up their engines again,\u201d Pamela Liebman, CEO of the Corcoran Group, told the New York Times. \u201cIn all my years of doing this, I have never seen such a hunger for New York City real estate.\u201d The high prices are partly due to the lack of housing, with many New York condos going straight to rental instead up for sale over the past few years. After the 2008 financial crash, construction in New York slowed down. With developers unable to get construction loans or revenue for projects, a lot of the planned projects were delayed or canceled. In 2014, the number of US homeowners reached a 20-year low. The national homeownership rate has been in decline for 10 years and reached 63.7% in the first quarter of this year - the lowest quarterly rate since early 1993. In Manhattan, especially, the high real estate prices have driven an increasing number of residents to rent rather than buy. The vacancy rate of Manhattan rentals this month reached 1.07%, down from 1.17% a year ago. That means that about 99% of apartments and homes available for rent in New York City are occupied. New York City rents have also reached a record high this month, with an average of $4,081 a month. The previous record high was $3,902 a month in May 2014, according to Douglas Elliman.",

    "webTitle": "Greece crisis: Berlin accuses Tsipras of seeking scapegoats outside own ranks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Berlin has delivered a blistering attack on Greece\u2019s beleaguered radical prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accusing him of lying to his own people and seeking scapegoats for the country\u2019s misery everywhere but in his own ranks. The German government dismissed desperate attempts by Athens to salvage some form of bailout, prompting Tsipras to hit back, accusing the country\u2019s creditors of trying to \u201cblackmail\u201d Greek voters with dire warnings that a vote against austerity in this weekend\u2019s referendum would be a vote to leave the euro. Tsipras referred to leaders of other eurozone nations as \u201cextremist conservative forces\u201d and blamed them for the capital controls that have forced the banks to shut down and ration cash. With relations between Greece and Germany now at their lowest point in the crisis, divisions have also opened up among the main EU powers over what to do about Greece after five years of bailout closed down on Tuesday and the country became the EU\u2019s first to default on loans to the International Monetary Fund. The trenchant criticism of Tsipras from Berlin reinforced the view that the German government might refuse to negotiate with the leftwing Syriza administration on any new rescue package after Sunday\u2019s referendum in Greece \u2013 which Berlin insists is a vote on whether to stay in the euro. The validity of the vote is now also being questioned. The Council of Europe said one week\u2019s notice fell short of international standards and the wording was unclear, while Greece\u2019s highest court has been asked to cancel the plebiscite on constitutional grounds. A judgement will not be made until Friday. Syriza\u2019s allies in the German parliament \u2013 die Linke, or the Left \u2013 accused the chancellor, Angela Merkel, of seeking to topple the Greek prime minister. It is an open secret in Berlin that Merkel, and especially her hawkish finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, would be happy to see Tsipras fall as a consequence of Sunday\u2019s vote. At the very least, German government sources say privately, Berlin wants Greece\u2019s flamboyant finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, replaced. The rising tension over the Greek debacle surfaced at the very top of the EU on Wednesday when Sch\u00e4uble rejected the latest Tsipras letter to his creditors accepting most of the austerity terms that last Saturday he had described as \u201chumiliation\u201d and \u201cextortion\u201d, while arguing for much more generous rescue funding over two years and including debt relief. Sch\u00e4uble said the Tsipras overture just muddied the waters further, while Merkel flatly ruled out any more negotiations this week after the Greeks have voted. \u201cThere can be no negotiations on a new aid programme until after the referendum,\u201d said Merkel. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, however, urged a quick fix. \u201cThe agreement must come immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while that we\u2019ve been talking about this agreement. It must happen now.\u201d Tsipras\u2019s erratic tactics in veering from rejectionism to conciliation and back within hours only added to the exasperation in eurozone circles. Sch\u00e4uble made plain that he had given up listening to the confusing signals from the Greek government, suggesting it will be very difficult for the two key parties, Athens and Berlin, to move quickly towards defusing a situation losing control. Time is very tight. As well as defaulting on \u20ac1.5bn of loans to the IMF on Tuesday, Greece has to redeem European Central Bank bonds worth \u20ac3.5bn on 20 July. \u201cGreece is in a difficult situation, but purely because of the behaviour of the Greek government ... Seeking the blame outside Greece might be helpful in Greece, but it has nothing to do with reality,\u201d said Sch\u00e4uble. \u201cThe Greek government is not doing its people any favours at all if it keeps making completely false statements. Nobody else is to blame for their situation ... It\u2019s all very sad. We\u2019re in a much harder situation than before. It was always difficult. But it has just kept getting more and more difficult since January.\u201d Tsipras assumed office in January. Tsipras was also criticised by Germany\u2019s vice-chancellor in the Merkel coalition, Sigmar Gabriel. He accused the leftwing Syriza government of allowing the wealthy and the oligarchs to suck the country dry and take \u201cbillions\u201d out of the country. \u201cWho\u2019s liable for this money? Workers in Germany, among others.\u201d He said Europe was doing nothing but throw money at \u201cthis corrupt state\u201d. Valdis Dombrovskis of Latvia, the EU commissioner for the euro, also said it might be possible to strike a deal before the ECB payment deadline on 20 July, only for Sch\u00e4uble to signal that may not be possible. In the last 24 hours Tsipras has pirouetted on his tactics to demand debt relief plus a new two-year \u20ac29bn baillout from the eurozone\u2019s permanent bailout fund, known as the ESM. However, this could only be negotiated quickly with maximum goodwill on both sides. The Germans will drive a hard bargain and Merkel may balk at having to take a third Greek bailout to the Bundestag where she could face a revolt. Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble strongly emphasised that there was no risk to the rest of the currency bloc from the Greek meltdown. \u201cEurope is strong,\u201d said Merkel. \u201cMuch stronger than five years ago at the start of Europe\u2019s debt crisis which originated in Greece.\u201d The German finance ministry website on Wednesday issued an FAQs list on Greece blaming the Tsipras government for the breakdown while reassuring Germans about the low likelihood of spillover effects. \u201cThe impact is limited. The eurozone itself is stable and safe. Contagion risks as in 2012 no longer exist.\u201d \u201cThe fact is,\u201d said Sch\u00e4uble, \u201cthat this [Tsipras] government has done nothing to build up a competent administration and it\u2019s been in office for six months.\u201d Merkel added: \u201cEurope\u2019s future is not at stake. It would be at stake if we forgot who we are and what makes us strong. We are stronger because of the reform policies of recent years, mainly due to Germany\u2019s position.\u201d",

The scheme \u2013 launched in 2008 \u2013 allows customers to order any item from the John Lewis website and have it delivered free of charge to their nearest John Lewis or Waitrose store or designated Collect Plus outlet. But the logistics of despatching regular orders of small and inexpensive items such as individual lipsticks and even packs of loom bands have become overwhelming, the retailer said. The John Lewis managing director, Andy Street, said: \u201cWe are sure customers will understand why we are doing this. There is a huge logistical operation behind this system and quite frankly it\u2019s unsustainable. We consider ourselves to be leaders and we want to take the lead on this.\u201d With a likely backlash from John Lewis shoppers who will complain about the new charging system, Street insisted they would still have plenty of other delivery options from the retailer. The announcement reflects the unprecedented growth of online shopping across the retail industry. John Lewis has invested significantly to support the growth and this year alone will be investing over \u00a380m in its supply chain function and \u00a3100m in IT \u2013 the latter five times more than five years ago. Today the department store processes over 6m click and collect orders a year, compared with 350,000 in its first year. At the heart of this is the operation of moving tens of thousands of parcels overnight, every night, from its huge Milton Keynes distribution centre to over 360 collection points across the country ready for customers to collect the following day. Its system was tested to the limit over Black Friday last year and in the runup to Christmas. Mark Lewis, John Lewis\u2019s online director, added: \u201cJohn Lewis is committed to being a leading omni-channel retailer and understands the importance of providing its customers with choice, convenience and above all else a long-term commitment to customer service.\u201d He said the delivery option of choice for customer was its next-day click and collect, but \u201cthe change we have announced today will mean that the majority of orders will remain free of charge while allowing us to invest further in the expansion of click and collect to ensure it continues to delight customers as it grows in popularity\u201d. John Lewis is investing heavily in omnichannel shopping, where online shopping as a percentage of total trade has more than trebled over the past eight years (from 10% to 33%). On Tuesday, Online retailer Amazon launched a one-hour delivery service, Prime Now, offering high-speed delivery on selected items to customers in east and central London. Customers, who must be Amazon Prime subscribers, can order goods to their home or office for delivery in the following hour for \u00a36.99.",

The budget airline, know for its publicity stunts, said that when the petition \u2013 Keep Europe\u2019s Skies Open \u2013 reaches 1m signatures Ryanair will present it to the European commission and urge it to take action. A second option proposed by the petition is that controllers from other European countries should be allowed to manage flights over French airspace during strikes to minimise cancellations for travellers crossing France to other countries. Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that Europe\u2019s consumers repeatedly have their holiday and travel plans disrupted or cancelled by the selfish actions of ATC unions every summer, who use strikes as a first weapon rather than a last resort. If the EU won\u2019t listen to the airlines, perhaps they\u2019ll listen to Europe\u2019s citizens.\u201d The main French controllers\u2019 union, the SNTCA has called a 48-hour strike starting at dawn on Thursday that will affect thousands of travellers. The strike is likely to affect flights not just to and from France but also destinations such as Italy and Spain which require planes to fly over French airspace. The action will be the second time this year passengers have been disrupted by an SNTCA stoppage. The union is unhappy about proposed increases to its members\u2019 pension age and a general worsening of working conditions. Steve Jary, national secretary for aviation at the Prospect union, which represents more than 3,000 UK controllers and engineers, said there had been no strike by UK air traffic controllers for more than a decade and that a ban was unnecessary. He said: \u201cRyanair has an appalling employment relations record and it has resisted unionisation in the UK for many years. The notion that you could start controlling airspace in France is nonsense because it isn\u2019t allowed. That shows that Ryanair is making political points here because it\u2019s not serious.\u201d A spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services union, which represents other air traffic control workers, said: \u201cInstead of trying to restrict the fundamental right to strike, which would level the UK down to some of the most repressive regimes in the world, companies like Ryanair would be better advised to lobby governments and employers to ensure workers get a fair deal to prevent disputes escalating.\u201d Travellers intending to fly from British airports were left stranded in April when French air traffic controllers stopped work. Ryanair said more than 3,600 flights were cancelled, disrupting the travel plans of more than 500,000 passengers.",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s it... Another day for the history books, with: Greece making an unprecedented default at the IMF: Losing the protection of its second bailout... ...and sensationally asking for a third package.... Eurozone finance ministers have already warned a 3rd deal will be tough In Athens, campaigners for a Yes vote on Sunday hit the streets. Fitch downgraded Greece, on fears of a looming default, And European stock markets fell again Here\u2019s the full story. We\u2019ll be back with a new liveblog in the morning, to do it all again. Thanks for reading, commenting, and your help. Goodnight! GW Confirmation that a 3rd bailout will be very hard to agree: The Guardian isn\u2019t the only UK paper leading on Greece tomorrow -- the crisis is also splashed on the FT (again!) and The Scotsman, plus the International New York Times. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, captures the historic nature of tonight\u2019s events (I\u2019ve added links to earlier points in the blog): Greece is left alone insolvent and almost bankrupt today after five years of \u20ac240bn in European bailouts dried up and the country became the first in the European Union to default on its creditors. The country failed to make a \u20ac1.5bn payment to the International Monetary Fund on time and thrust the eurozone into an emergency. The long-running debt debacle left Greece on the brink of financial collapse, worsening recent years of wrenching austerity, and represented a historic blow to a Europe committed to the irreversibility of its 16-year-old single currency. The deadline on Greece\u2019s bailout programmes, inaugurated in 2010, ended at midnight. The country was left without a financial lifeline for the first time since. In a sudden referendum called on creditors\u2019 bailout terms which formally no longer exist, Greeks are to vote on Sunday on what EU leaders say is a choice between quitting or staying in the euro. Following a fortnight of non-stop brinkmanship at the highest level of EU leadership over how to resolve the impasse over Greece\u2019s financial rescue, the radical leftwing government of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, tabled surprise new proposals on Tuesday, demanding that the bailout concluding yesterday be rolled over into a new two-year programme worth almost \u20ac30bn to Greece to be spent on servicing debt. The demand included calls for a month of bridging finance to avoid the IMF default and for broader debt relief without mentioning Greek concessions in return for acceptance. It was promptly spurned by key creditors as too little too late. \u201cWe won\u2019t negotiate about anything new at all until a referendum, as planned, takes place,\u201d said Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Tuesday. \u201cThis evening the programme expires.\u201d The 19 finance ministers of the single currency bloc talked for merely an hour by teleconference on Tuesday evening and dismissed the last-minute brinkmanship from Tsipras. But Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the committee, said the ministers would confer again on Wednesday and that Athens was expected to present further proposals on how to resolve the critical situation..... More, if your nerves can take it, here: Analysts at SocGen agree that any new bailout would take time, which has implications for the ECB in terms of getting its own repayments due in July from Greece. \u201cOur view is that agreeing on a third bailout will be a lengthy process, which suggests that Greece will miss the ECB payment on 20 July.\u201d \u20ac6.7bn of Greek bonds owned by the ECB mature in July and August, according to this handy breakdown of Greek debts from Reuters. Greece now joins Somalia, Sudan and Zimbabwe in arrears at the IMF tonight. Now, attention shifts to Frankfurt and the European Central Bank. The ECB, which has been providing drip-feed support to Greece\u2019s ravaged banks, will discuss whether to increase, or potentially withdraw emergency funding at its scheduled governing council meeting on Wednesday. Referring to Greece\u2019s sudden request for a new deal on Tuesday, the economic research team at Daiwa Capital Markets drew a link to Wednesday\u2019s ECB meeting and discussions about emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). In a note published before, but in anticipation of, the missed IMF deadline, they wrote: \u201cGiven the length and ultimate failure of the talks on the current programme, it would likely take several months to agree the detail of a new third programme, if indeed such a programme could be agreed at all. (The creditors would surely expect the current Greek government to be negotiating in bad faith.) So, this latest ruse from Tsipras might be interpreted as an attempt to boost the \u2018No\u2019 vote in the coming weekend\u2019s referendum by suggesting that it need not necessarily represent a vote for Grexit. It might also seek to give cover to the ECB to maintain ELA tomorrow if and when the IMF payment has been missed.\u201d Over in Brussels, the death of Greece\u2019s second bailout programme has been confirmed too. The failure to get an extension tonight - and the broader failure of the two sides to reach a deal since January (!) \u2013 means the \u20ac7.2bn of loans won\u2019t be handed over. It also meatns that \u20ac10.9bn set aside to recapitalise Greece\u2019s banks has vanished too. Klaus Regling, CEO of the EFSF (the body which made the loans to Greece) argues that the bailout programme was delivering results: Due to the economic policies adopted under the EFSF programme, the country was on a good path towards strong growth until the second half of 2014. The many sacrifices which the Greek people had to make were paying off. Greece managed to cut its budget deficit and regain competitiveness. The country was able to access financial markets again and saw its high unemployment start declining. According to the OECD and World Bank, Greece was a reform champion until 2014, with encouraging growth prospects. This trend can continue if the Greek population decides to return to the path of reform within the euro area.\u201d Greece shouldn\u2019t hold out much hope of an extension to its \u20ac1.5bn bill -- even though the IMF said it would consider the request. On top of the \u2018is it, or is it not, a default\u2019 debate, there is the question over whether this constitutes a credit event. This matters, because a credit event (which isn\u2019t simply what it says on the tin: someone not meeting a creditor demand) triggers payouts on credit default swaps - a kind of insurance contract against a country or company defaulting. The credit ratings agencies have already said not paying the IMF, which relates to official money and not private bondholders, is not a credit event. In any case it is up to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) to rule over what is and isn\u2019t a credit event. More on ISDA and all that in this piece from 2012. In the genteel world of the IMF, one falls into \u2018arrears\u2019 rather than plunging into \u2018default\u2019. But, if it looks like a default, swims like a default, and quacks like a default, then it\u2019s probably a default, my colleague Katie Allen explains. As near-bankrupt hurtles towards its deadline to pay the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, financial experts are grappling with the question of whether a failure to come up with the cash would constitute a sovereign default. A default occurs when a country, or other borrower, fails to meet its obligation to repay a lender on time. But it is not, technically, the borrower who defaults: it is the lender who declares that the borrower is in default. Rating agencies have declared that missing a payment to an official body like the IMF isn\u2019t the same as defaulting on a loan to, say, a commercial bank. But, as Gary Jenkins, chief credit strategist at LNG Capital, said: \u201cThere has been lots of talk that this is not really a default. Indeed the rating agencies have stated that they would not consider a non-payment as a default. All I can say on this matter is that if you do not pay the absolute last lender of resort I think that\u2019s a default.\u201d The IMF has issued a short statement, confirming that Gerry Rice told reporters a few minutes ago that: \u201cI confirm that the SDR 1.2 billion repayment (about EUR 1.5 billion) due by Greece to the IMF today has not been received. We have informed our Executive Board that Greece is now in arrears and can only receive IMF financing once the arrears are cleared. \u201cI can also confirm that the IMF received a request today from the Greek authorities for an extension of Greece\u2019s repayment obligation that fell due today, which will go to the IMF\u2019s Executive Board in due course.\u201d Greece is not the first country to be in arrears to the IMF, and (spoiler alert) it certainly won\u2019t be the last. But it is the first \u2018advanced economy\u2019 to be in this state (Argentina simply threw the IMF out). And most other countries have only taken such a dramatic step because they were riven with conflict. These are not normal times in the eurozone. This really is a moment. Here\u2019s how the news broke in Washington, via Reuters. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday confirmed Greece had not made its 1.5 billioneuro loan repayment to the Fund, making it the first advanced economy to ever be in arrears to the Fund. The missed payment, the largest in the Fund\u2019s history, is equivalent to a default, in that both imply a breach of Athens\u2019 obligations. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said Greece can now only receive further IMF funding once the arrears are cleared. Rice confirmed that Greece had asked for a last-minute repayment extension earlier on Tuesday, which the Fund\u2019s board will consider \u201cin due course.\u201d Breaking news from Washington -- the International Monetary Fund has confirmed that Greece did not make its \u20ac1.5bn repayment today. It also confirms that Athens did make a request to extend the payment. And the board will now consider that request \u201cin due course\u201d. I don\u2019t know immediately if that is a possible reprieve, or the Fund just following the official policy.... IMF CONFIRMS GREECE DOES NOT MAKE 1.5 BLN EURO REPAYMENT TO THE FUND* IMF SAYS RECEIVED GREECE REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF REPAYMENT* IMF SAYS BOARD WILL CONSIDER GREEK REQUEST FOR EXTENSION IN DUE COURSE That\u2019s it. There was no last-second reprieve. No sudden appearance of \u20ac1.5bn in the IMF\u2019s bank account. Greece\u2019s financial crisis has just entered a new phase. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s 6pm in Washington....so we\u2019re about to find if Greece is the first developed country to default on an IMF loan...... And midnight in Brussels, meaning its second bailout programme is over. Tick, tock, tick, tock.... This is the way the bailout ends, not with a bang.....but with journalists gathering outside the International Monetary Fund\u2019s HQ in Washington. That\u2019s because the IMF may confirm, sometime after 6pm local time, that Greece has not repaid the \u20ac1.6bn due today. That would mean it is officially \u2018in arrears\u2019 with the Fund -- which Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the eurogroup, has already dubbed being \u2018in default\u2019. And it just happens that the second bailout programme will also expire, quietly, at the same moment - midnight Brussels. The last hope of an brief extension was extinguished tonight by eurozone finance ministers this evening, even though Athens is seeking a new, third bailout tonight. So, Greece will enter Wednesday without the cloak of a programme from its eurozone neighbours, with its banks closed, capital controls in place, and a looming referendum: A sneak preview of Wednesday\u2019s front page: And the story is that Greece has no chance of debts down to a sustainable level anytime soon, if it accepts the deal from its creditors. Alberto Nardelli reports: Greece would face an unsustainable level of debt by 2030 even if it signs up to the full package of tax and spending reforms demanded of it, according to unpublished documents compiled by its three main creditors. The documents, drawn up by the so-called troika of lenders, support Greece\u2019s argument that it needs substantial debt relief for a lasting economic recovery. They show that, even after 15 years of sustained strong growth, the country would face a level of debt that the International Monetary Fund deems unsustainable. The documents show that the IMF\u2019s baseline estimate \u2013 the most likely outcome \u2013 is that Greece\u2019s debt would still be 118% of GDP in 2030, even if it signs up to the package of tax and spending reforms demanded. That is well above the 110% the IMF regards as sustainable given Greece\u2019s debt profile, a level set in 2012. The country\u2019s debt level is currently 175% and likely to go higher because of its recent slide back into recession. The documents admit that under the baseline scenario \u201csignificant concessions\u201d are necessary to improve Greece\u2019s chances of ridding itself permanently of its debt financing woes. Even under the best case scenario, which includes growth of 4% a year for the next five years, Greece\u2019s debt levels will drop to only 124%, by 2022. The best case also anticipates \u20ac15bn (\u00a310bn) in proceeds from privatisations, five times the estimate in the most likely scenario. But under all the scenarios, which all assume a third bailout programme, looked at by the troika \u2013 the European commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF \u2013 Greece has no chance of meeting the target of reducing its debt to \u201cwell below 110% of GDP by 2022\u201d set by the Eurogroup of finance ministers in November 2012.... (more here) Jeroen Dijsselbloem has also told CNN that \u201cGreece will be in default tomorrow morning to the IMF\u201d, unless it makes that \u20ac1.6bn repayment within the hour.... Here\u2019s a video clip of the head of the eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, confirming that Greece\u2019s bailout cannot be extended beyond tonight. There\u2019s simple not enough time - and also the political situation hasn\u2019t changed - says, speaking after tonight\u2019s teleconference. He adds that a third bailout is always possible, but warns it would be \u201cquite a procedure\u201d and in the meantime the situation in the Greek economy and banking sector has become even worse: \u201cSo it would be a very difficult path to consider.\u201d There must be better ways to mark the end of your bailout than by getting downgraded. Rating agency Fitch has just cut Greece\u2019s rating by one notch from CCC to CC, in an unscheduled move. It says there is now a much higher danger that Greece defaults on debt owed to private creditors (so not the IMF, or the ECB). Fitch admits that it had expected a deal to come before tonight: The breakdown of the negotiations between the Greek government and its creditors has significantly increased the risk that Greece will not be able to honour its debt obligations in the coming months, including bonds held by the private sector. We now view a default on government debt held by private creditors as probable. Recent events have taken us beyond our previous base case that a deal would be struck before the expiry of the programme. Fitch has also assessed the impact of Sunday\u2019s referendum: The government has called a referendum for 5 July on whether to accept the 25 June proposals of the creditor institutions regarding policy conditionality and is endorsing a \u2018No\u2019 vote to reject the deal. Although early polls suggest a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote is the more likely outcome, the risk of a \u2018No\u2019 vote is significant. In our view, a \u2018No\u2019 vote would dramatically increase the risk of a Greek exit from the eurozone. Such an exit would probably be disorderly as the current government is unlikely to co-operate with the European authorities in such an event. Although a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote may help to avoid some of the more extreme risks face by Greece, the credit situation would remain precarious. A \u2018Yes\u2019 could lead to the formation of a new government with a mandate to reach an agreement with creditors on policy conditionality. However, the composition of the Greek parliament (two-thirds of MPs belong to anti-austerity parties) and the short timeframe before Greece\u2019s \u20ac3.5bn Eurosystem redemption would make this a challenging prospect. The current situation also means that Greece will most probably begin to run arrears with the IMF (\u20ac1.6bn loan repayment due 30 June) and risks running arrears on bonds held by the Eurosystem (\u20ac3.5bn due 20 July). Excluding bonds held by the Eurosystem, coupon payments and redemptions in July amount to about \u20ac200m. Fitch is also worried that the capital controls brought in yesterday will cause severe damage to the economy (a plausible conclusion) The imposition of capital controls in Greece and risk of a disorderly and more permanent break from the Eurozone\u2019s payment system has led us to lower the Country Ceiling by one notch to \u2018CCC\u2019. This reflects an increased risk that domestic entities will be unable to service international debt obligations due to the restrictions on capital outflows from the Greek economy. Here\u2019s a video clip of tonight\u2019s demonstration, from Reuters: And for balance.... here\u2019s a reminder of yesterday\u2019s \u201cNo campaign\u201d rally. Rumours of (attempted) horse-trading at the eurogroup conference call this evening: Drat, I missed the hour mark. Greece now has just under two hours until its bailout expires. That\u2019s also the moment that it misses its payment to the IMF - joining a small gang who are currently in arrears: There\u2019s some dispute tonight about exactly what Dragasakis said on TV. So, for Greek readers, here\u2019s a clip: The rest of us can watch the comments section below for insight..... :) Deputy Prime Minister Yannis Dragasakis also told ERT tonight that Greece had sent at letter to the eurogroup that \u201cnarrows the differences further\u201d. This suggests Athens may make new concessions in return for a new, 3rd bailout: \u201cWe are making an additional effort. There are six points where this effort can be made. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics. But it includes pensions and labour issues.\u201d And that plan can be discussed on Wednesday morning - a conference call has been called for 10.30am BST / 12.30pm Athens. Greece\u2019s Kathimerini newspaper is reporting tonight that Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister, will present details of the measures Greece would implement in return for a third bailout. Greek deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis has told state-run TV in the last few minutes that the government may not go ahead with the referendum, reports Helena. Dragasakis was expected to make an announcement tonight but not this! His statement may well set the ball in motion - but it is not clear how the government will stop its vote. As we reported earlier, the speaker of the Athens parliament, Zoe Konstantopoulou, says it is constitutionally impossible to halt the referendum. Several readers are kindly pointing out that tonight\u2019s protests can\u2019t match the huge anti-bailout protests of 2011-2012 -- tonight\u2019s merely looks like one of the biggest \u201cpro-bailout\u201d demos. Sorry for the confusion. Evangelos Venizelos, the former Socialist Pasok leader and finance minister, told SKAI News earlier: \u201cIf there is no deal, the ship of hope will head towards a desert. This is a prologue what we are living and experiencing this week.\u201d Some of the thousands of flag-waving Greeks who braved the summer thunderstorm today have told us that their country belonged in Europe, and leaving it would lead to calamity. \u201cIt would take us so far backwards, a generation or more,\u201d said Ellie Douka, a non-profit employee. \u201cIt\u2019ll be economic, social, and cultural Armageddon,\u201d added Yiorgio Economos, a junior executive in a shipping firm. \u201cThis is just so dangerous. It\u2019s absolutely imperative we stay in.\u201d Many yes campaigners fear that a No victory would put Greece on the path out of Europe - as several EU leaders warned on Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s no plan, no plan at all, for if we leave,\u201d said Lydia, a designer wearing a white silk suit and carrying a large multicoloured umbrella against the unseasonal downpour. \u201cHow could they even think of putting the country at such risk? It\u2019s madness.\u201d Takis Liberdopoulos, who imports industrial machinery, said Greece \u201chas to stay in \u2013 its our only protection against what this government is planning.\u201d (ps: I\u2019ve tweaked that earlier entry comparing tonight to earlier demos, as we dropped an important word, so please refresh #editingerror GW ) Phoebe Greenwood has been speaking to Yes supporters in Athens about the news that Greece has asked for a third loan package today. One tells her that he has little confidence that Alexis Tsipras can reach an agreement with creditors: It\u2019s not clear what he wants to do, and whether they are close in terms of an agreement. And another Yes supporter believes that Alexis Tsipras was trying to shore up his domestic political support: The rain does seem to have dampened the mood somewhat: Despite the rain (and it\u2019s now pouring) protestors in Athens are saying they will remain in Syntagma until midnight \u201cso that politicians inside parliament can hear our resounding yes.\u201d The yes camp is also planning a a major demonstration on Thursday, organisers say. Athens could get pretty heated, if supporters of the NO camp decide to rally on the same day. After speaking at the rally, Athens mayor George Kaminis hotfooted it to Bloomberg TV, and called for Alexis Tsipras to resign so \u201cfresh new leadership\u201d can be put in place. Greece has barely three hours to meet its \u20ac1.6bn repayment to the IMF, or fall \u2018into arrears\u2019. Greece\u2019s deputy PM, Yannis Dragasakis, has revealed that Athens sought a last-ditch delay.... Over in Athens SKAI news is reporting that at least 22,000 people have poured into Syntagma square to attend tonight\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d rally, reports our correspondent Helena Smith. The gathering is so large that protestors are now crushed and spilling out of ALL the streets that run into the Greek capital\u2019s main square. No pro-bailout demonstration, quite as big, has been seen in the five years that I have covered the crisis. The passion of those attending was evident in the speech that an uncharacterically angry mayor of Athens, George Kaminis, gave at the start of the rally. Thumping the lectern, Kaminis accused the leftist-led government of masterminding a referendum that now puts Greek voters in front of a false dilemma. \u201cThe real dilemma is yes or no to Europe,\u201d he railed. This anecdote may show how tonight\u2019s Yes demonstrators are wealthier than those who attended last night\u2019s rally, for the No side. Some pro-Eu protesters have argued with riot police who were deployed to prevent them reaching the parliament building in Athens: Eurozone finance ministers are likely to speak again tomorrow: Newsflash: Eurozone finance ministers have just finished their teleconference call. And Finland\u2019s representative, Alex Stubb, has tweeted a strong hint that Greece\u2019s request for short bailout extension will not be granted (not a shock) A third bailout programme, though, is possible..... No doubts about it - it\u2019s a big turnout of Yes voters tonight: (if you\u2019re just tuning in, there are video interviews with yes campaigners here) Half of Fleet Street have decamped to Athens, adding a new terror to the Greek debt crisis. (the other half are running rival Greek crisis liveblogs) The FT\u2019s Henry Foy reports that tonight\u2019s Yes protest is pretty civilised: Jess Brammar of BBC Newsnight has found signs of a backlash against Yanis Varoufakis: Our own Jon Henley is ready to get wet as he speaks to the crowds again: And Buzzfeed\u2019s Jim Waterson has found that whistles are being sold to demonstrators: Back in Brussels, EC president Jean-Claude Juncker fled a meeting with the press, because he has something more urgent, and Greek-related to attend to: Our own Jon Henley has also been speaking to Yes supporters today. Spyros Petropoulos, a commercial lawyer, said he resented being branded a \u201ctraitor, even a German-lover\u201d by some anti-austerity voters. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard, I\u2019ve worked well, I\u2019ve contributed to what\u2019s left of the economy and I\u2019ve made sure people can be paid their salaries and their pensions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of that, actually. But I see why people feel so strongly. Greece is suffering and Greece needs change, and there are a lot of people who think radical change is the only answer. You have to respect where they\u2019re coming from.\u201d Ptropoulos said he believed firmly that Greece have to stay in Europe and in the eurozone. This just so dangerous. This country needs stability, and that\u2019s the reverse of what it\u2019s getting. And going back to the drachma will be far, far harder than anyone thinks. We\u2019ll be like a developing country.\u201d Most recent polls show a clear \u2013 though apparently shrinking \u2013 majority of Greeks are eager to stay in the euro, but are at the same time reluctant to accept the additional austerity demanded by their country\u2019s creditors as the price for continued membership in the bloc. A former history teacher, Vasilis Papakonstantinou, said leaving the euro would be \u201cdisastrous, just disastrous.\u201d \u201cThe knock-on effects would be simply terrible. I can understand an unemployed graduate might not see things that way \u2013 but I believe Greece would be entering a new era of hardship like we haven\u2019t seen here for nearly a century.\u201d Another Yes voter tells Phoebe Greenwood that she is very fearful of the impact of a No results on Sunday. As well as the economic impact of leaving the EU, she worries that \u201cnon-democratic processes\u201d could take hold in Greece: It\u2019s only in the European Union that legal democratic processes are guaranteed. In Athens, one campaigner tells my colleague Phoebe Greenwood that it is vital that the Yes campaign win on Sunday. We have to stay in Europe, it is very important to make new economic reforms, and urgent to take some austerity measures, he says. What happens if No wins? That is a question for Mr Tsipras. Despite the rain, thousands of demonstrators have turned up in Syntagma Square tonight to show their support for the Yes campaign, ahead of Sunday\u2019s referendum. Oh dear. Indiegogo, the crowdfunding web site, now appears to have crashed under the weight of people trying to donate to Greece tonight. Sorry guys. Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence reckons the application for a third bailout today was just \u201cdomestic consumption\u201d ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote. The most realistic scenario remains a Greek application for a third program at some point after the referendum on Sunday \u2013 supposing that the \u201cYES\u201d vote prevails. The request for a \u20ac30bn loan means Tsipras is betting on a \u201cwin-win situation\u201d, Wolf reckons: If the counter offer were to be accepted by the creditors (unlikely), this would be positive given it entails debt relief; if the offer is rejected (highly likely), he can re-unify his cabinet, blaming Greece\u2019s European partners and boosting the \u201cNO\u201d vote ahead of Sunday. However... the increasingly erratic activism in Athens over the last hours also reveals that some in the Greek government are deeply worried now that it becomes clear that the Greek bet on the lenders\u2019 fear of contagion has not played out A senior Syriza party official has just told Helena Smith that: \u201cEVERYTHING NOW IS POSSIBLE.\u201d With extraordinary timing a storm is now moving through Athens with a sudden downpour of rain over Syntagma where thousands are gathering for tonight\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d rally. A crowd-sourcing fund set up to help Greece has pulling in donations at an impressive rate. Started yesterday by London shoe seller Thom Feeney, it has already raised almost \u20ac230,000 from almost 15,000 people. Officially, Feeney is aiming to raise \u20ac1.6n to cover tonight\u2019s \u20ac1.6bn bill to the IMF. After all, as he puts it: I was fed up of the Greek crisis going round in circles, while politicians are dithering, this is affecting real people. While all the posturing is going on, then it\u2019s easy for the politicians to forget that. I just thought, sod it, I\u2019ll have a crack. In return for funding, you could receive a little something from Greece: Pledge \u20ac3 and get a postcard sent from Greece of Alex Tsipras. Pledge \u20ac6 and get a greek Feta and Olive salad Pledge \u20ac10 and get a small bottle of Ouzo sent to you Pledge \u20ac25 and get a bottle of Greek wine You can donate here. There are reports from Athens that some firms have been pushing their staff to take part in tonight\u2019s Yes rally. Not sure how substantial they are, so I\u2019ve alerted our people on the ground - in the meantime, regular reader equusmulusoctopus has kindly provided the details: Yes supporters are gathering in the centre of Athens tonight for their rally, along with plenty of journalists who report that all is calm so far. There\u2019s no way of stopping Sunday\u2019s referendum, it seems. Not only has the Tsipras government now set up a web page dedicated to the plebiscite, the parliament\u2019s fiery president Zoe Konstantopoulou has announced that constitutionally there is no way to revoke the popular vote. \u201cFrom the moment that it was decided, there is no constitutional procedure to cancel the referendum....\u201d said Konstantopoulou appealing for an end to the \u201ccunning interventions, terror and propaganda\u201d that, she said, had been employed to stop the ballot. A sticker for rules, Konstantopoulou, who comes from Syriza\u2019s far left, has repeatedly said that Greece\u2019s quest to experience its right to democratic vote will not be thwarted. As president of the 300-seat House she has often stated that no memorandum outlining austerity will be endorsed by parliament. The German chancellor has deflated Yanis\u2019s tires. According to Reuters, Angela Merkel has now confirmed that Berlin isn\u2019t prepared to negotiate a third bailout until Sunday\u2019s referendum has been held GERMANY\u2019S MERKEL SAYS BEFORE THE PLANNED GREEK REFERENDUM IS CONDUCTED WE WILL NOT NEGOTIATE ON ANYTHING NEW MERKEL SAYS THAT ALSO APPLIES IF \u201cOFFERS WHICH CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED IN MORE DETAIL\u201d ARE MADE TODAY The Athens stock market remains closed today, for the second day running. And that is a real problem for fund managers. They are meant to record a \u201cNet Asset Value:\u201d for their assets, but how on earth can they assess what their shares and bonds are worth? Ryan McNelley, Managing Director in portfolio valuations at Duff &amp; Phelps, says investors are in a real pickle: We are receiving calls from liquid managers trying to figure out a value for their Greek investments. Most simply do not have a pricing policy that accommodates this situation, as many fund strategies specifically exclude investment in illiquid securities. Absent observable market inputs for valuation, these newly illiquid investments will move from objective market valuations to a more subjective analysis. The amount of subjectivity involved in working out a price for a Level 3 asset makes it essential that managers adopt an objective, independent view when arriving at that value. Greece appears to be requesting a bailout of almost \u20ac30bn Today\u2019s letter explains that it is simply seeking more funding to cover debt that expires between 2015 and 2017. And that, according to this letter uploaded by the FT, is over \u20ac29bn. In that case, Greece would have to run a balanced budget - as it is locked out of the financial markets. As we covered earlier, Greece is also asking for its debt to be restructured (tricky) and a short extension of its current bailout (trickier still). Also.... the request is being made under Articles 12 and 16 of the ESM Treaty. As Peter Spiegel of the FT points out: Unfortunately for Tsipras, Article 16 also happens to mention that a new programme must include a new \u201cMoU\u201d \u2013 or memorandum of understanding, a phrase that is politically poisonous in Greece. In the financial markets, there\u2019s little hope of any major breakthroughs tonight, says Chris Weston of IG: Greece is living in its final hours before passing into the unknown territory that lies beyond the bailouts of the past five years. It is a journey that even Jason and his Argonauts might balk at venturing on. Europe\u2019s stock markets ended the day deep in the red again, with the Greek crisis causing some alarms again (although not a full-blown crash). There was a last-minute selloff (how appropriate!), driving the FTSE 100 down 99 points for the day: Other members of Greece\u2019s negotiating team have joined Yanis Varoufakis and Alexis Tsipras at the PM\u2019s mansion to discuss the situation (in a blow for photographers, they didn\u2019t all arrive on motorbikes) The latest rumblings out of Brussels don\u2019t sound too good for Greece.... But one thing\u2019s clear, this story ain\u2019t over yet. The campaign for a Yes vote in Sunday\u2019s referendum will begin holding demonstrations in central Athens, in around an hour\u2019s time. Germany isn\u2019t alone in reacting warily to Greece\u2019s request for a third bailout; Politico\u2019s Ryan Heath hears that others countries are unimpressed. Wall Street has gone back to - largely - ignoring the Greek crisis after yesterday\u2019s dip. In morning trading the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are all up marginally. There has been speculation that the Federal Reserve may delay raising interest rates if the eurozone crisis escalates, which could account for today\u2019s better mood. At least someone\u2019s happy... As news of the third bailout request sent ripples through the eurozone, Greece\u2019s finance minister left the finance ministry. His destination -- the prime minister\u2019s residence, Maximos Mansion, for a meeting. First though, Yanis Varoufakis had to negotiate his way through the Athens traffic, and the gridlock of reporters outside his office. Angela Merkel has told lawmakers in Germany that her government can\u2019t consider any new proposal from Greece until Sunday\u2019s referendum has taken place. Is that slamming the door, or leaving it tantalisingly ajar? Eurozone finance ministers cannot simply shred this request from Athens for a new bailout; they have to give it serious consideration. As our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, points out, Brussels has been insisting for days that the door is open. They can\u2019t just slam it in Alexis Tsipras\u2019s face now, however exasperated they may be. The Greek government\u2019s statement leads little for conjecture, says Helena Smith. It is still not backing down from holding a referendum on Sunday. \u201cThe Greek government today suggested a two-year agreement from the European Stability Mechanism for the full coverage of financial needs and at the same time restructuring of debt. \u2018The Greek government until the end will seek a viable solution within the euro. This will be the message of NO to a bad agreement in Sunday\u2019s referendum.\u201d Here\u2019s the letter which Greece has sent to the Eurogroup, asking for a new two-year loan. You can see that Athens is also asking, again, for its current bailout to be extended beyond tonight for \u201ca short period of time\u201d to avoid a technical default. (such an extension now seems almost impossible, though, as it would need parliamentary approval) Newsflash: eurozone finance ministers are going to speak in three and a half hours to discuss Greece\u2019s request for a third bailout. They are due to speak at 6pm BST, or 8pm Athens time. Vince Scarpetta, of the Open Europe thinktank, agrees that Greece would probably face a similar list of \u2018reforms\u2019 if it took a third bailout. But the debt relief question remains critical here.... could Tsipras get enough to persuade his MPs to back it, and persuade the country that he\u2019d got the best deal possible? Greece\u2019s proposal for a new two-year bailout has just arrived in Brussels, according to Marco Zatterin of Italian newspaper La Stampa. So now, we wait to discover exactly what Greece is suggesting..... If Greece does get a third bailout, it would inevitably have to agree new economic reforms (or conditionality), as Credit Agricole\u2019s Frederik Ducrozet points out: And a third bailout would have to be agreed by all other eurozone governments; Germany\u2019s Bundestag is in NO mood to give the current Greek government any concessions. Many experts have been predicting for months that Greece would need a third bailout, if it couldn\u2019t return to the financial markets this summer (as it clearly cannot). But the constant wrangling over the second bailout has meant that no discussion could take place about a third deal. The imminent death of Greece\u2019s second bailout means the situation changes. But it didn\u2019t have to be done this way, as the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel points out: Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, is hearing the deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis will announce news of the proposed third bailout tonight. Insiders are saying that the Greek prime minister will fly to Brussels imminently. How Tsipras will make the about turn - and save face - will be interesting. The issue of debt relief is key.... The eurozone crisis simply cannot break its addiction for last-minute developments and late-night meetings. But this request for a third bailout, as second programme enters its final hours, is a classic.... Announcing the remarkable news that it now wants a third bailout, the Greek government says: \u201cFrom the first moment, we made clear that the decision to hold a referendum is not the end but the continuation of negotiations for better terms for the Greek people... The Greek government will until the end seek a viable agreement within the euro.\u201d The Greek government has proposed a new Two-Year bailout programme, according to news breaking in Athens. This two-year programme would be supplied under the European Stability Mechanism (Europe\u2019s bailout fund) And \u2013 crucially \u2013 would run alongside a debt restructuring. And it wouldn\u2019t include the International Monetary Fund. In a statement from Alexis Tsipras\u2019s office, cited by Reuters, Greece says it is still at the negotiating table, and seeking \u201ca viable solution, under the end, aimed at staying in the euro.\u201d This could be a very significant development, depending on how creditors react. Or it could be very swiftly shot down. No word yet on how large this programme would be, though, let alone what conditions Greece is prepared to accept. One important point -- this would not be an extension of the current bailout (which was made under the EFSF and expires at midnight) but a whole new programmme. That means a discussion of debt relief would be an option. Details and reaction to folllow.... Over in the Greek capital, a press briefing with foreign journalists has just been cancelled - so cabinet ministers can gather for an urgent meeting. The Eurogroup president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has also just pulled out of a TV interview - citing \u201curgent obligation\u201d. So much urgency, and so little time left..... As tonight\u2019s deadline approaches for Greece to pay \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF and agree a deal before its bailout extension runs out, there are hopes that the country and its creditors can still come to some sort of deal. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has said plainly that Greece will not pay the IMF - an event which ratings agencies would not consider as a default - but is still hopeful of an agreement. And there are reports that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras may be ready to agree a deal, and could even travel to Brussels tonight. Tsipras has also reportedly had telephone contact today with EU president Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi and European parliament president Martin Schultz. But it is not clear whether there have been any changes to what Greece\u2019s creditors proposed on Friday, which was rejected in favour of a referendum to be held on Sunday. Greece\u2019s chief negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos has talked of new proposals but German chancellor Angela Merkel has said she has not heard of any changes since Friday. Meanwhile Reuters reported: EC president Jean-Claude Juncker had offered to convene an emergency meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Tuesday to approve an aid payment to prevent Athens defaulting, if Tsipras sent a written acceptance of the terms. He also dangled the prospect of a negotiation on debt rescheduling later this year if Athens said \u201cyes\u201d. Markets have come off their worst levels, with both Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both marginally in positive territory after early falls. Elsewhere Spain\u2019s prime minister Mariano Rajoy added his voice to the chorus of European leaders saying that a no vote in Sunday\u2019s referendum means Greece will have to leave the eurozone. But German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble went against the trend by saying that was not necessarily the case. And Greece denied plans to re-instate the drachma despite a tweet to that effect by one of the country\u2019s MPs. Here\u2019s Bloomberg on Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s comments: German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told lawmakers in Berlin that Greece would stay in the euro for the time being if Greek voters reject austerity in a referendum scheduled this week, according to three people present. Schaeuble also said the European Central Bank would do what\u2019s needed to protect the euro if Greeks voted against the bailout terms in the July 5 referendum, according to the people, all of whom participated in the closed-door meeting on Tuesday. They asked not to be identified, citing the private nature of the discussion. The German Finance Ministry declined to comment. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble seems to have gone against the trend, by saying Greece would not have to leave the euro if it voted no in Sunday\u2019s referendum, according to Reuters. Meanwhile one thing working against the No campaign in the Greek referendum is the broad media support for the country accepting the terms on offer from its creditors. John Hooper reports from Athens: Television is overwhelmingly anti-Syriza. All the big, privately-owned channels \u2013 Alpha, ANT1, Mega, Star and Skai \u2013 lean towards accepting the lenders\u2019 offer to secure Greece\u2019s position in the euro zone. The exception is state-owned ERT -- unsurprisingly since it was put back on the air by the current government after being shut down as an economy measure in 2013. There was a pretty easy way this week of telling which way a Greek newspaper leaned in the debate \u2013 the alarm quotient in its coverage. \u201cPensions with tears\u201d screamed the headline on Tuesday\u2019s edition of centre-right Dimokratia over a story about how some beneficiaries had been unable to get their pensions after the imposition of capital controls on Sunday night. Ta Nea, EU-friendly and centre left, had \u201cPayment suspensions throughout business: only cash for transactions.\u201d But leafing through Avgi, the only major daily close to Syriza, you might think nothing much out of the ordinary was happening in Greece this week. The only concession to a move that has made headlines around the world was a story on its front page headlined: \u201cSide-effects of capital controls under control.\u201d With the conservative broadsheet, Kathimerini, centre-right Eleftheros Typos and centre-left Efimerida ton Syntakton also favouring a compromise, the rejectionists are heavily outgunned in the Greece\u2019s lively and extensive press. Even Rizospastis, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), has an ambiguous stance. KKE\u2019s 15 MPs voted against the referendum, but now it is taking place, the party is recommending a \u2018no\u2019 vote. Rizospastis said it was urging voters to download a special ballot paper to \u201csay no to both\u201d. Bookies William Hill have cut their odds on a No vote in the Greek referendum from 2/1 to 5/4, and lengthened the odds for a Yes vote from 4/11 to 4/7. \u2018All the serious money so far has been for a \u2018No\u2019 vote\u2019 said Hill\u2019s spokesman Graham Sharpe. Hills now offer 7/4 that Greece will leave the Eurozone during 2015, 2/5 that the country will stay in. The effect of the Greek crisis on everyday lives is being shown again, as Fitch Ratings reports that mortgage arrears have risen during the protracted negotiations between the government and its creditors. Fitch says: A deteriorating economy and almost total absence of bank credit may have combined with retail borrowers withholding loan repayments during the extended period of uncertainty. Some mortgage borrowers may already be strategically entering early-stage arrears as the crisis damages the banking sector. They may also be choosing to make payments on other debts rather than mortgages as they are aware that banks are unlikely to enforce against their property collateral. Greek mortgage performance appeared to be stabilising before the January elections. Loans with at least one monthly instalment overdue represented around 16% of total loan balance. But they climbed to 16.9% in February in the aftermath of the elections, and continued to rise even after a temporary bailout programme extension was secured at the end of that month, reaching 17.3% in May. We expect early-stage arrears to have increased further during June. The full report is here: Fitch: Greek Tensions Have Pushed Up Mortgage Arrears It is still unclear whether there is anything new on the table. Greece\u2019s chief negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos seemed to be suggesting earlier that there was. But Reuters is quoting German chancellor Angela Merkel saying that the last offer she is aware of from the Commission is the one from Friday of last week. And... Meanwhile, as a change of pace, here is a piece of video of yesterday\u2019s rally in Athens: The Greek prime minister\u2019s office has also announced that Tsipras has had telephone contact today with EU president Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi and European parliament president Martin Schultz, reports Helena. Helena Smith has more on a possible deal, with talk that Alexis Tsipras may be set to travel to Brussels soon to discuss it: Reports are mounting that the Greek prime minister has not only accepted a deal but will travel to Brussels, possibly as early as this evening, to discuss it with senior EU officials. The deal, based on reforms proposed by EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker late last night, is believed to have been rubber stamped at a meeting of senior government official held at the prime minister\u2019s office, the Megaron Maximou, this morning. The German daily, Bild, is also backing up the reports, saying Tsipras has had contact with high ranking EU officials whom he will meet imminently. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s plane is at the ready,\u201d the paper said. Speaking to Mega TV, Konstantinos Michalos who heads the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry and is widely respected in Greek economic circles, reinforced that, he, too, had a growing sense that \u201cpositive developments\u201d would be seen late this evening. \u201cI have a positive feeling that we will have developments, positive developments late this evening,\u201d he told the station saying he was basing his optimism on contacts he had had earlier today with senior officials in the Eurogroup of euro area finance ministers. \u201cThe situation in the market place is a nightmare and by the end of the week will be a lot worse. It is crucial that we get this agreement. Yes, the fiscal measures [being demanded by lenders] are hard but we know them, we can deal with them. The alternative is catastrophe, a situation difficult for the human mind to comprehend.\u201d Greece\u2019s head of state, president Prokopis Pavlopoulos has also waded in and has made several telephone calls to senior EU officials. A former conservative minister, Pavlopoulos has said he \u201cwill go to the boundaries of my authorities\u201d to ensure the country remains in the single currency and by extension Europe. Despite that, hopes are indeed growing for a deal. Meanwhile Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has said the country will not make the \u20ac1.6bn IMF payment on Tuesday. But he still hopes for a deal with creditors.... More from Greece\u2019s chief negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos: Meanwhile, more from the EU Commission spokesman: This refers to Juncker\u2019s comment yesterday about \u201cnot choosing suicide over death.\u201d Uh oh: Greek television is now reporting that the country\u2019s government is sending its own proposals to creditors: And apparently EC president Juncker has no plans to visit Greece before the referendum. Confirmation that contact between the two sides is underway, but so far no real movement, according to the EU commission spokesman. Reuters reports: Greece has not yet made any movement in response to a last-minute bid by creditors to broker a deal to end a deadlock over the Greek debt crisis, the European Commission said on Tuesday. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday night and Juncker, after speaking to the chair of euro zone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem, explained what a last-minute deal could look like, Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters. \u201cThis would require a move from the Greek government which President Juncker asked (for) before midnight last night. As we speak, this move has not yet been received, registered, and time is now narrowing,\u201d Schinas said. Contacts were under way with the Greek government on Tuesday however, Schinas said. Some clarity about what offer EC president Jean-Claude Juncker made last night to Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, and it seems like it was the same offer as before according to the EU commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas: And another piece of housekeeping. Eurozone inflation slowed in June from 0.3% year on year to 0.2%, in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. Meanwhile eurozone unemployment came in at 11.1% in May, the same level as in April and - again - in line with expectations. The European Commission seems to be showing little sign of bending: 30-Jun-2015 11:19:20 - EUROPEAN COMMISSION SAYS DOOR OPEN FOR GREEK DEAL, BUT TIME RUNNING OUT QUICKLY 30-Jun-2015 11:20:27 - EUROPEAN COMMISSION SAYS NO MOVE HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM GREECE 30-Jun-2015 11:21:05 - EUROPEAN COMMISSION SAYS GREEK GOVERMENT WOULD NEED TO ACCEPT PUBLISHED PROPOSAL (snaps from Reuters) Danuta Huebner, chair of the committee on constitutional affairs at the European Parliament, has tweeted about the legality of Grexit: Whether or not it would be a default if Greece misses its \u20ac1.6bn payment due to the IMF by tonight, Greek banks would struggle to remain solvent for many days according to a European Central Bank supervisor. Reuters reports: Asked how long Greek banks could hold out were the country to miss a \u20ac1.6bn payment to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday, [the ECB\u2019s} Felix Hufeld said they could be considered solvent for up to five days. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of days,\u201d Hufeld, who sits on the ECB supervisory board that decides whether Greek banks are still solvent, told the Frankfurt business journalists\u2019 club late on Monday, in remarks set for release on Tuesday. \u201cYou can argue for hours about whether it\u2019s two, three, four or five days,\u201d he said. The remarks by Hufeld, who also heads German banking watchdog Bafin, underline the gravity of the situation facing Greece\u2019s banks immediately after a missed payment to the International Monetary Fund and an end of its bailout programme. But they also indicate that the ECB would not immediately deem the banks bust, thereby cutting their access to central bank funding ahead of a bailout vote on Sunday. Over in Athens, the govermment has hotly denied that it is drafting plans to re-instate the drachma as suggested by the pro-European Potami party MP Harry Theoharis in a tweet earlier today, reports Helena Smith. The centrist\u2019s MP\u2019s assertion was beyond the bounds \u201cof science fiction\u201d prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led administration announced in a statement. \u201cIt constitutes a monument of irresponsibility,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDisgrace and nothing more.\u201d Theoharis, who not that long ago had the thankless task of heading Greece\u2019s tax collection agency, had tweeted that a group from the general accountacy office, dedicated to reintroducing the old currrency, had already set up shop in the prime minister\u2019s office, the Megaron Maximou. But of course, nothing is ever as easy as both sides agreeing something in a straightforward way, as the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel indicates: As a reminder, here\u2019s our handy guide to the payments Greece is due to make: Meanwhile the reports that Greek prime minister Alex Tsipras is considering the latest EU proposals - and has told Brussels as much - have lifted markets off their worst levels. Germany\u2019s Dax is now down just 0.3% while France\u2019s Cac is 0.2% lower. Spain\u2019s Ibex is now up 0.3%. Amid all the planning for the referendum and the uncertainty of Greece\u2019s current situation, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has made time to read the views of economist Joseph Stiglitz published by the Guardian: Any deal would reportedly be based on the offer made to Athens by EC president Jean-Claude Juncker last night: There seem to be some frantic last-minute efforts to get a deal together before tonight\u2019s deadline, despite how unlikely that may have seemed earlier. Helena Smith reports: The possibility of a solution still being found to break the deadlock was highlighted this morning when a senior government official let slip that Greece\u2019s payment of \u20ac1.6bn in outstanding loans to the IMF should still not be ruled out. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it [will be paid] at this moment,\u201d said one well-placed government source. \u201cBut at previous times, they have always found a solution at five to twelve.\u201d Perhaps, in this case it will be one minute to twelve. No one is ruling it out! This morning the online news portal Newsit.gr citing exclusive sources reported that an \u201corgy of meetings\u201d in Athens and Brussels were now taking place to break the impasse by midnight, when Greece\u2019s bailout programme officially expires. Several cadres in Tsipras\u2019 governing far left Syriza party, have reportedly been hitting the phones to implore Tsipras to accept the latest offer proposed by creditors. \u201cDevelopments are fast moving and they are happening right now,\u201d the newsite said. \u201cAccording to [our] information, a serious plan is being organised by several sides so that an agreement can be reached by midnight. \u201cA very important point is that this deal will NOT include the IMF,\u201d it said. France is believed to have played a central role brokering the agreement. Leading figures in Syriza are urging the government to accept an interim agreement if necessary to stave off bankruptcy. Russia seems keen to distance itself from the Greek crisis. From Reuters: Finding a solution to Greece\u2019s debt crisis is not a matter for Russia but for Athens and its creditors, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday. \u201cThis is Greece\u2019s problem,\u201d Peskov told journalists on a conference call. \u201c(It\u2019s a matter) of Greece\u2019s relations with its creditors, it\u2019s not a matter for us.\u201d Meanwhile our correspondent Helena Smith has just spoken with the country \u2018s chief negotiator who insists that Greece has indeed not closed the doors on talks with its creditors: Sunday\u2019s referendum should be seen \u201cas part\u201d of the negotiations not something that cancels them out, Euclid Tsakalotos, the point man in talks between Athens and the international bodies keeping it afloat, told me this morning. \u201cThe referendum is part of the negotiation, it is not in lieu of it,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope shouldn\u2019t be afraid.\u201d The comments echoed similar sentiment voiced by prime minister Alexis Tsipras last night who also said that a strong \u201cno\u201d vote would bolster Greece\u2019s place at the negotiating table. \u201cWe have not left the negotiating table. We are still at the negotiating table,\u201d he told state-run TV, ERT. Tsakalotos, who has been coordinating talks between the two sides since replacing outspoken finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, seemed optimistic that despite the hullabaloo over the referendum, negotiations would continue. \u201cYes, of course they will,\u201d he said, suggesting that the two sides had come very close to a deal last week. \u201cThe idea was that we were going to take it to parliament before Germany and other parliaments also voted on it. But then we went one step further and said we should put it to the Greek people as a whole, let democracy work, which would have meant extending the programme by a week or so,\u201d he said of Greece\u2019s request to prolong its financial lifeline. \u201cI really can\u2019t see why that couldn\u2019t happen. Extending [the programme] by a few days would not have been the end of the world.\u201d Political commentators this morning said it was clear that Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led government was still holding out for a better deal. \u201cHe is still playing some kind of poker, waiting for something better,\u201d said Christos Memis, a veteran political analyst now in charge of the respected news portal, Protagon.gr. \u201cThat is very unlikely to happen now before the poll [on Sunday]. What has become clear is that lenders don\u2019t trust Tsipras, they want him out and he is right when he says the differences are ideological, it is no longer just about him.\u201d Tsipras may be trapped in his referendum gambit but creditors had also made several mistakes, Memis said. \u201cTactically speaking they were totally wrong not to accept the 47-page list of proposals the government made last week. Had they accepted it and Tsipras tried to implement it, six months later his government would have collapsed, he would have gone.\u201d Greeks are waiting with baited breath for the release of several opinion polls that will reflect just where the country stands, psephologically, on the \u201cno,\u201d \u201cyes\u201d vote. \u201cThings will become much clearer and move a lot faster when the polls come out later today and tomorrow,\u201d said Memis. And could those talks in fact actually take place after all? Attempts are being made to get Athens back to the negotiating table, according to Austrian finance minister Hans Joerg Schelling. But he said he was not very optimistic about the possibility of holding further talks with Greece. The comments came after EC president Jean-Claude Juncker made a last-minute offer to Athens to reach an agreement before the bailout deadline ends later today. \u201cAttempts are taking place to hold further talks. I\u2019m not too optimistic,\u201d Schelling told reporters. \u201cAs for the euro, as you\u2019ve seen in the past 48 hours, it hasn\u2019t been affected especially. The euro is stable. The euro is strong...We don\u2019t expect any special spillover effects or contagion.\u201d (Quotes courtesy Reuters) Bit of housekeeping, the UK GDP figures: More from Rajoy, courtesy Reuters: Mariano Rajoy said on Tuesday that if Greece were to leave the euro it could send the message that the common currency union is reversible and other countries could follow. \u201cWhat would happen if Greece came out of the euro? There would be a negative message that euro membership is reversible,\u201d Rajoy said in a radio interview. \u201cPeople may think that if one country can leave the euro, others could do so in the future. I think that is the most serious problem that could arise (from a Greek exit).\u201d Spain\u2019s prime minister Mariano Rajoy has added his voice to the chorus of European leaders saying that a no vote in Sunday\u2019s referendum means Greece will have to leave the eurozone. Rajoy, who faces his own anti-austerity political rivals in Podemos, told Spanish radio: If Tsipras loses the referendum, this will be good for Greece. If he wins the referendum, Greece has no alternative other than to leave the euro. We\u2019ve been gathering views from Greeks on their views on the current turmoil and whether they want to remain in the eurozone, and the results from 100 people are here: The European Central Bank has admitted that Greece may end up leaving the euro. In an interview with France\u2019s Les Echo, ECB executive board member Benoit Coeure said a Grexit could happen, although it was not what the Bank or other EU institutions wanted. He said: A Greek exit from the eurozone, so far a theoretical issue, can unfortunately not be excluded any more. And according to Reuters, there may be no need for the drachma\u2019s return after all: Greece will not leave the euro zone, the country\u2019s foreign minister Nikos Kotzias told China\u2019s Ambassador to Greece Zou Xiaoli, according to a statement on China\u2019s Foreign Ministry website. \u201cGreece will not leave the euro zone, and is willing to work with China to further develop bilateral relations and practical cooperation in all areas,\u201d the Foreign Ministry statement cited Kotzias as saying. Kotzias made the comments in a meeting with Zou on Monday. This might be a bit premature, given we haven\u2019t had the referendum yet, although with the speed at which events are happening, who can say: Here\u2019s the latest German unemployment figures: Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has been one of the closest allies of Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, but yesterday he added his voice to the chorus of leaders saying the referendum was a vote on Greece\u2019s eurozone membership. And now he has perhaps shown one reason why he is losing patience with the Greek government: The market falls are accelerating as the uncertainty continues: The FTSE 100 is now down 0.84% at 6565 Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 0.94% France\u2019s Cac is 1.06% lower Spain\u2019s Ibex has fallen 0.65% Here\u2019s our latest update on the situation from Jennifer Rankin: Greece is on course to miss a crucial debt repayment on Tuesday, amid an ongoing and bitter row with creditors about who is to blame for the breakdown in talks on its eurozone future. After five years of painful austerity and four months of wrangling with its creditors, Greece\u2019s international bailout will come to an end on Tuesday, as a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.13bn) payment to the International Monetary Fund falls due. A Greek government official confirmed on Monday that Athens will not make the \u20ac1.6bn loan instalment, which is due to the IMF by 6pm Washington time (11pm BST, midnight in Brussels and 1am in Athens). The Washington-based fund has long said that late-payers do not get a grace period. Failure to pay means Greece will become the first developed nation in history to default to the IMF and joins a club of countries in arrears that currently includes Sudan, Somalia and Zimbabwe. Full story here: When is a default not a default? Many have been saying that if Greece does not pay the \u20ac1.6bn due to the International Monetary Fund by tonight\u2019s deadline that does not count. Gary Jenkins, chief credit strategist at LNG Capital, is not so sure: Greece is due to pay the IMF today. It appears that they will not make the payment. There has been lots of talk that this is not really a default. Indeed the rating agencies have stated that they would not consider a non-payment as a default. All I can say on this matter is that if you do not pay the absolute last lender of resort I think that\u2019s a default. We\u2019ll see how the markets take it when it happens (as seems inevitable). On the referendum, Jenkins says: My take on it is that if the Greek people vote \u2018No\u2019 to the proposals that Mr Tsipras may feel vindicated and insist upon a new round of negotiation. However the probable damage done to the economy by recent events will make this a largely Pyrrhic victory. It is possible that the Institutions will restart negotiations but it is equally likely that they would indeed regard such a result as a step towards exit from the Eurozone. I\u2019m leaning towards more negotiations but with little additional support from the ECB so more damage to the economy. If the Greek people vote \u2018Yes\u2019 then it is difficult to see how Mr Tsipras can remain as Prime Minister. Under this scenario a new government is likely to be formed that will accept the Institutions terms which I guess may be eased somewhat to reflect the new economic conditions and to try and build a new relationship between the parties. So whilst the impact upon the market on Day 1 has been less than feared that is not to say that we will not see further weakness over the coming days. The market may have been taking comfort from all of the opinion polls that have taken place in Greece over the last few years showing that the Greek people wanted to stay in the Eurozone at pretty much any cost. However all of these polls were taken before the call for a referendum. Certainly I would expect a \u2018No\u2019 vote to be met with significant volatility in peripheral government bonds amid the classic flight to quality. This is clearly now a fast moving situation and it is still by unclear as to how it will play out. As an old credit analyst my instinct therefore is to be cautious and wait to see what the weekend brings. Next Monday could be a much worse day for peripheral debt than yesterday was if the \u2018No\u2019 vote wins. Not that we thought they had but: European markets edge lower in early trading If Greece does default on its payment to the IMF it will be following an historical precedent. The Economist says: The first recorded sovereign default was in the 4th century BC when ten Greek cities failed to honour loans from the temple of Delos. Its full piece on defaults is here. Away from Greece, a couple of other bits of economic news due today: 9.30 BST UK final revision of first quarter GDP 10.00 Eurozone unemployment 10.00 Eurozone consumer price index 15.00 US consumer confidence As if the stakes were not high enough, Greece is threatening a court injunction against the EU institutions to block any exit from the eurozone, according to the Daily Telegraph: \u201cThe Greek government will make use of all our legal rights,\u201d said the finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis. \u201cWe are taking advice and will certainly consider an injunction at the European Court of Justice. The EU treaties make no provision for euro exit and we refuse to accept it. Our membership is not negotiable,\u201c he told the Telegraph. Good morning and welcome to yet another crunch day for Greece. The country faces a deadline to pay \u20ac1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund by the end of the day, at the same time as its bailout extension negotiated in February runs out. Without an unlikely last-minute deal the bailout will end and \u20ac7.2bn which would have been paid by its creditors, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, will be off the table. But with the dramatic events of the weekend, which saw Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras call a referendum on whether to accept the latest proposals from its creditors and lead to capital controls and an extended bank holiday, today\u2019s deadlines have been overtaken by events. Tspiras last night made a television appeal to Greeks to vote against the austerity package he sees as being imposed on the country, arguing it would strengthen negotiations with its creditors. Rallies took place in Athens and elsewhere in support of a no vote. But European leaders lined up to call the referendum a vote on whether Greece would stay in the euro or leave, piling more pressure on Tsipras and his colleagues. Our full report is here: Meanwhile overnight, EC president Jean-Claude Juncker - after earlier calling for a yes vote - apparently made a last-minute offer to Athens to reach an agreement before the bailout deadline ends. Under the deal, Tsipras would have to campaign for a yes vote, which is hardly likely to happen. Reuters has some details of what would have been in it for the Greeks: The offer published on Sunday incorporated a proposal from Greece that would set value-added tax rates on hotels at 13 percent, rather than at 23 percent as originally planned in the lenders\u2019 proposals. It was not immediately clear whether there would be any additional changes. If the offer were accepted, the euro zone finance ministers could adopt a statement saying that a 2012 pledge to consider stretching out loan maturities, lowering interest rates and extending an interest payment moratorium on euro zone loans to Greece would be implemented in October. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: In a sign that battle lines continue to be drawn EU leaders have turned Sunday\u2019s proposed referendum into an in/out vote on Greece\u2019s position in the euro, when it is clearly about the creditors proposal, but given that polls appear to suggest a majority of the Greek population would prefer to stay in the euro, it suits the narrative of the EU to peddle that particular line. In fact EU Commission President Juncker strayed a little too far into the realms of bad taste yesterday, urging the Greek population not to commit suicide by voting No, which in a country that has seen suicides soar as a result of EU policies, was crassly insensitive, and could well turn out to be a massive own goal, if the vote is indecisive. Maybe that explains last night\u2019s late move to make a fresh attempt at trying to reach a deal by the EU Commission President, but in any event the deal was rebuffed by the Greek PM, with the only concession appearing to be on VAT for hotels being held down at 13%, instead of raised to 23%. Worries about the chaos in Greece hit stock markets yesterday, with the FTSE 100 down nearly 2% and French and German markets down 3%. Asian markets edged up overnight but European markets are expected to open lower once more. CMC\u2019s opening calls show: FTSE100 is expected to open 27 points lower at 6,593 DAX is expected to open 79 points lower at 11,004 CAC40 is expected to open 28 points lower at 4,841",

RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/615975983624138752\">June 30, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Fitch admits that it had expected a deal to come before tonight:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The breakdown of the negotiations between the Greek government and its creditors has significantly increased the risk that Greece will not be able to honour its debt obligations in the coming months, including bonds held by the private sector. We now view a default on government debt held by private creditors as probable. Recent events have taken us beyond our previous base case that a deal would be struck before the expiry of the programme.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fitch has also assessed the impact of Sunday\u2019s referendum:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has called a referendum for 5 July on whether to accept the 25 June proposals of the creditor institutions regarding policy conditionality and is endorsing a \u2018No\u2019 vote to reject the deal. Although early polls suggest a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote is the more likely outcome, the risk of a \u2018No\u2019 vote is significant. In our view, a \u2018No\u2019 vote would dramatically increase the risk of a Greek exit from the eurozone. Such an exit would probably be disorderly as the current government is unlikely to co-operate with the European authorities in such an event.</p> <p>Although a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote may help to avoid some of the more extreme risks face by Greece, the credit situation would remain precarious. A \u2018Yes\u2019 could lead to the formation of a new government with a mandate to reach an agreement with creditors on policy conditionality. However, the composition of the Greek parliament (two-thirds of MPs belong to anti-austerity parties) and the short timeframe before Greece\u2019s \u20ac3.5bn Eurosystem redemption would make this a challenging prospect.</p> <p>The current situation also means that Greece will most probably begin to run arrears with the IMF (\u20ac1.6bn loan repayment due 30 June) and risks running arrears on bonds held by the Eurosystem (\u20ac3.5bn due 20 July). </p> <p>Excluding bonds held by the Eurosystem, coupon payments and redemptions in July amount to about \u20ac200m.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fitch is also worried that the capital controls brought in yesterday will cause severe damage to the economy (a plausible conclusion)</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The imposition of capital controls in Greece and risk of a disorderly and more permanent break from the Eurozone\u2019s payment system has led us to lower the Country Ceiling by one notch to \u2018CCC\u2019. This reflects an increased risk that domestic entities will be unable to service international debt obligations due to the restrictions on capital outflows from the Greek economy.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f652e083001469dc486227278bd2dc52f8b02dac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f652e083001469dc486227278bd2dc52f8b02dac/0_0_3543_2437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"epa04825195 Tourists sit in front of a closed bank in central Athens, Greece, on 30 June 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-30T20:44:36.013Z\">at 9.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5592f7efe4b07edb74969aac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-30T20:19:27.207Z\">9.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s a video clip of tonight\u2019s demonstration, from Reuters:</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/jun/30/greek-crisis-thousands-rally-athens-support-of-eu-bailout-deal-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4a9ha\"                        data-video-id=\"2329624\"            data-video-name=\"Greek crisis: Thousands rally in Athens in support of EU bailout \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            data-video-poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/30/1435693119731/KP_337566_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457321142\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/30/1435693117393/KP_337566_crop_1200x720.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/30/150630GreeceRally_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/06/30/150630GreeceRally_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/06/30/150630GreeceRally_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/06/30/150630GreeceRally_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/30/150630GreeceRally.m3u8\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Tuesday: Yes rally in Athens</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>And for balance.... here\u2019s a reminder of yesterday\u2019s \u201cNo campaign\u201d rally.</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/jun/30/greek-rally-no-vote-refereundum-athens-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4a9va\"                        data-video-id=\"2329165\"            data-video-name=\"Greeks rally behind no vote ahead of referendum \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters and AFP\"            data-video-poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/30/1435660432899/KP_334964_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457311812\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/30/1435660426964/KP_334964_crop_1200x720.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/30/150630Greece2_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/06/30/150630Greece2_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/06/30/150630Greece2_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/30/150630Greece2.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/06/30/150630Greece2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Monday: No rally in Athens</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5592f8d8e4b075e173d5313b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-30T20:16:58.874Z\">9.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rumours of (attempted) horse-trading at the eurogroup conference call this evening:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/StefanLeifert/statuses/615951781177225216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">Varoufakis hat in Eurogruppe angeboten, Referendum gegen Schuldenschnitt zu tauschen.

Many have been saying that if Greece does not pay the \u20ac1.6bn due to the International Monetary Fund by tonight\u2019s deadline that does not count.</strong> Gary Jenkins, chief credit strategist at LNG Capital, is not so sure:</p> <blockquote> <p data-dropid=\"1\">Greece is due to pay the IMF today. It appears that they will not make the payment. There has been lots of talk that this is not really a default. Indeed the rating agencies have stated that they would not consider a non-payment as a default. All I can say on this matter is that if you do not pay the absolute last lender of resort I think that\u2019s a default.</p> </blockquote> <p>We\u2019ll see how the markets take it when it happens (as seems inevitable). On the referendum, Jenkins says:</p> <blockquote> <p data-dropid=\"2\">My take on it is that if the Greek people vote \u2018No\u2019 to the proposals that Mr Tsipras may feel vindicated and insist upon a new round of negotiation. However the probable damage done to the economy by recent events will make this a largely Pyrrhic victory. It is possible that the Institutions will restart negotiations but it is equally likely that they would indeed regard such a result as a step towards exit from the Eurozone. I\u2019m leaning towards more negotiations but with little additional support from the ECB so more damage to the economy.</p> <p data-dropid=\"3\"> If the Greek people vote \u2018Yes\u2019 then it is difficult to see how Mr Tsipras can remain as Prime Minister. Under this scenario a new government is likely to be formed that will accept the Institutions terms which I guess may be eased somewhat to reflect the new economic conditions and to try and build a new relationship between the parties.</p> <p data-dropid=\"4\"> So whilst the impact upon the market on Day 1 has been less than feared that is not to say that we will not see further weakness over the coming days. The market may have been taking comfort from all of the opinion polls that have taken place in Greece over the last few years showing that the Greek people wanted to stay in the Eurozone at pretty much any cost. However all of these polls were taken before the call for a referendum. Certainly I would expect a \u2018No\u2019 vote to be met with significant volatility in peripheral government bonds amid the classic flight to quality.</p> <p data-dropid=\"5\"> This is clearly now a fast moving situation and it is still by unclear as to how it will play out. As an old credit analyst my instinct therefore is to be cautious and wait to see what the weekend brings. Next Monday could be a much worse day for peripheral debt than yesterday was if the \u2018No\u2019 vote wins.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55924354e4b0e31832956e17\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-30T07:21:24.089Z\">8.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Not that we thought they had but:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/statuses/615781204856418304\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Russia Reiterates Greece Hasn&#39;t Applied For Financial Aid: RIA</p>&mdash; Steve Collins (@TradeDesk_Steve) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/status/615781204856418304\">June 30, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55923fb4e4b0e31832956e0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-30T07:08:06.161Z\">8.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European markets edge lower in early trading</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23e1b4f893969f80d2726882496bd78619b91426\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435648058988/00cc1bb6-c524-4433-9e85-7902aa44bc2e-460x51.png\" alt=\"Markets dip in early trading.\" width=\"460\" height=\"51\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Markets dip in early trading.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55923e97e4b0e31832956e0c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-30T07:01:49.748Z\">8.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If Greece does default on its payment to the IMF it will be following an historical precedent.

Rallies took place in Athens and elsewhere in support of a no vote.</p> <p>But European leaders lined up to call the referendum a vote on whether Greece would stay in the euro or leave, piling more pressure on Tsipras and his colleagues.</p> <p>Our full report is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/greek-crisis-referendum-eurozone-vote-germany-france-italy\">Europe's big guns warn Greek voters that a no vote means euro exit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile overnight, EC president Jean-Claude Juncker - after earlier calling for a yes vote - apparently made a last-minute offer to Athens to reach an agreement before the bailout deadline ends.</p> <p>Under the deal, Tsipras would have to campaign for a yes vote, which is hardly likely to happen. Reuters has some details of what would have been in it for the Greeks:</p> <blockquote> <p data-dropid=\"2\">The offer published on Sunday incorporated a proposal from Greece that would set value-added tax rates on hotels at 13 percent, rather than at 23 percent as originally planned in the lenders\u2019 proposals. It was not immediately clear whether there would be any additional changes.</p> <p data-dropid=\"3\">If the offer were accepted, the euro zone finance ministers could adopt a statement saying that a 2012 pledge to consider stretching out loan maturities, lowering interest rates and extending an interest payment moratorium on euro zone loans to Greece would be implemented in October.</p> </blockquote> <p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK:</p> <blockquote> <p data-dropid=\"3\">In a sign that battle lines continue to be drawn EU leaders have turned Sunday\u2019s proposed referendum into an in/out vote on Greece\u2019s position in the euro<strong>,</strong> when it is clearly about the creditors proposal, but given that polls appear to suggest a majority of the Greek population would prefer to stay in the euro, it suits the narrative of the EU to peddle that particular line. </p> <p data-dropid=\"4\"> In fact EU Commission President Juncker strayed a little too far into the realms of bad taste yesterday, urging the Greek population not to commit suicide by voting No, which in a country that has seen suicides soar as a result of EU policies, was crassly insensitive, and could well turn out to be a massive own goal, if the vote is indecisive. Maybe that explains last night\u2019s late move to make a fresh attempt at trying to reach a deal by the EU Commission President, but in any event the deal was rebuffed by the Greek PM, with the only concession appearing to be on VAT for hotels being held down at 13%, instead of raised to 23%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Worries about the chaos in Greece hit stock markets yesterday, with the FTSE 100 down nearly 2% and French and German markets down 3%.<br></p> <p>Asian markets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/asian-markets-creep-up-as-the-euro-sags-in-deepening-greek-crisis\">edged up overnight </a>but European markets are expected to open lower once more.
