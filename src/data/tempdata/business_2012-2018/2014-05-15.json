Fuelling the row about how to overhaul the company's troubled chain of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies, Meg Hillier is also expected to tell a conference in Manchester, home to the Co-op, that bold steps are needed to revive the 150-year-old organisation. The conference comes on the eve of a crucial vote on proposals set out by Lord [Paul] Myners to reform the group by creating a slimmed-down board, populated by professionals, and forming a national members council. Hillier is also expected to urge the group to proceed with caution over its response to the \"have your say survey\" launched by Euan Sutherland just before he quit as chief executive in March. The survey included questions about whether the group should continue making donations to the Co-op party. Sutherland left his post after details of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal were leaked to the Observer. His deal included a retention package equal to his \u00a31.5m salary for two years, and similar payments are being offered to remaining management. Sutherland's temporary replacement, Richard Pennycook, (who will become chief operating officer once a new head is found) was paid \u00a31.3m, including a \u00a3750,000 retention bonus for six months' work last year. He is also in line for a long-term share award of up to another \u00a3750,000.

Not because they want to make money out of the Co-op or otherwise take advantage of the organisation.\" He said on the website set up to conduct his review of the group: \"The people that the group should want to attract to its board are those who feel a genuine and deep affinity with its goals and values. \"These are not going to be the sharp-suited, pinstriped cartoon characters that are being feverishly conjured up in the minds of some co-operators.\" His rebuttal came as a line-up of speakers prepared to speak at the conference in Manchester; they included Sir Graham Melmoth, who ran the Co-op until 2002. He has already said that he does not believe the supermarkets, funeral homes and farms can return to the glory days. Hillier, who is a Co-op MP, will tell delegates that the ideas set out by Myners do not give members enough of a say in the organisation, which traces its roots back to the Rochdale pioneers of 150 years ago. \"Lord Myners, a member of a body determined mostly by patronage and partly by primogeniture, seems to have lost sight of any democracy in his proposals for reform.

Members of the Co-op, which is 78% owned by eight million members through seven regional boards, and 22% owned by independent societies, are to vote on a resolution linked to Myners' principles at the group's annual meeting on Saturday. Myners is resigning at the meeting, after just five months as the only independent director on the board. Hillier will also call on the group not to abandon its dividend, currently on hold because of last year's \u00a32.5bn losses. She claimed the \"have your say survey\", which she said cost \u00a31.5m, was \"an unnecessary, expensive and undemocratic farce\". Myners issued his rebuttal about his proposals after remarks by officials from Co-ops UK, which campaigns for co-operatives, who suggested that his ideas for reform needed to be altered.",

    "webTitle": "AstraZeneca at risk from Pfizer tax avoidance plans, says company chief", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, has stepped up his attack on the business model of Pfizer, the US drugs company stalking the UK business, and warned that the British drugs group could be damaged by Pfizer's tax avoidance plans. Pfizer, which has proposed a \u00a363bn takeover of the UK business, intends to use the AstraZeneca deal to relocate its tax base to the UK. The move is designed to move away from the US's higher rate of corporation tax, but US Democratic senators angered by the strategy have expressed determination to close this legal loophole. Soriot told the Guardian on Thursday: \"The risk is that if it turns into a controversy our own company would be impacted by it. Even if we were to agree a [takeover] deal, it takes eight to 10 months to close it. \"If this controversy leads to a delay, you have to remember the shareholders of Pfizer can still vote no. Imagine we go through this entire process of waiting, a lot of anxiety in our employees' minds, lots of distraction, , potential controversy surrounding us and in the end the deal doesn't happen and we are left flailing in the wind.\" Soriot also hit back at Pfizer's pledge to ringfence work on important medicines and criticised the US group's plan to split the combined business into three separate divisions. \"It's all very well to say we will ringfence, but what does it mean, ringfencing? You have to understand precisely how you would do that. The model where you would split the company in three pieces I don't think would work at all for our business.\" He pointed to AstraZeneca's MedImmune arm in Cambridge, which specialises in immunology \u2013 coming up with drugs for immune diseases and cancer \u2013 and designing antibodies for cancer, respiratory and other diseases. \"It's impossible \u2013 you can't split MedImmune into three pieces.\" The proposed takeover has sparked deep-seated concerns within the science community and at Westminster about the impact on UK research. David Cameron has said he is not satisfied with Pfizer's pledges to protect jobs and research, while business secretary Vince Cable has refused to rule out intervention in the bid although he admits it would be \"tricky\" for the government to act. The chair of the House of Commons science select committee, Andrew Miller, wrote to the science minister, David Willetts on Thursday to express his growing concerns about the takeover. His letter was sent just hours after the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, signed a decree giving the Paris government new powers to block foreign takeover bids for companies deemed \"strategic\". A large part of one of France's leading companies, Alstom, is currently the target of another large US corporation, GE. EU competition chief Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, however, said the UK government has not approached him so far over a change to British law on a \"public interest\" test that might be used to protect AstraZeneca against Pfizer's bid. Soriot admitted that if AstraZeneca were a French business, the government would be playing a much bigger part in the negotiations. The French-born Australian, who has led AstraZeneca for 18 months, said: \"There would be a massive controversy for sure \u2013 just look at the controversy that is happening around Alstom.\" However, he refused to ask the British government to intervene to help protect the UK company, which is responsible for 2% of the country's exports, saying: \"Every country has to develop its own national policy.\" Speculation is now mounting that Pfizer is close to coming back with a higher offer intended to force AstraZeneca's board to the negotiating table. Soriot, however, said that price was not the only factor to consider: \"We're very much aware of our fiduciary duty and we'll make sure we consider an offer that is a good offer for our shareholders.\"But some people read from this that we are ready to sell, the deal will happen and it's only a question of price. Absolutely not. This deal is not inevitable. \"We have a strategy that works, we have the critical mass to succeed, we are one of the largest pharmaceutical companies \u2013 how big do you need to be?\" Pfizer boss Ian Read spent a second day touring City investors on Thursday to press the case for his bid. Soriot was meanwhile attempting to woo his shareholders \u2013 many of whom are also big Pfizer investors \u2013 by talking up AstraZeneca's cancer pipeline. He said the value of the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker's pipeline will crystallise in the company's share price long before 2023. By that date the company expects a 75% uplift in annual revenues to more than $45bn. Soriot pointed to other companies that have turned themselves around \u2013 such as Bristol Myers-Squibb in the US. Analysts believe Pfizer will raise its proposal to \u00a353-\u00a355 a share from \u00a350 two weeks ago. One large investor said: \"The ball is now in Pfizer's court to see if they can find an offer which brings Astra to the table. They can go hostile, though that is risky. \"We have indicated that we think [AstraZeneca] should consider, talking but there needs to be an inducement to talk and in that sense it's Pfizer decision.\" AstraZeneca has not suffered any setbacks through drugs failing in development in the last eight months. Soriot noted that lung drug AZD9291, which new data shows shrank tumours in over half of patients, the cancer immunotherapy PD-L1 treatment, and asthma medicines benralizumab and tralokinumab, have all been engineered in Cambrige. \"We are very much rooted in science in this country.\" AstraZeneca's defence was strengthened by the release of promising clinical data ahead of a key cancer US conference, which Soriot, a biologist, plans to attend. He reminded his shareholders that they would receive cash and shares in the new company, which is why its strategy and integration are crucial. \"Would it be a strategy that is science led with an investment in R&amp;D or would it be a strategy of: we cut costs and we maximise short-term cashflow?\" Meanwhile, research by Amsterdam-based AntWorks shows that Pfizer is already dominant in over 80% of the therapeutic areas of both companies combined. Given the vast overlap, \"it is unlikely that AstraZeneca's R&amp;D departments will feel secure about their futures.\" Additional reporting by Sean Farrell",

This deal is not inevitable.</p> <p>\"We have a strategy that works, we have the critical mass to succeed, we are one of the largest pharmaceutical companies \u2013 how big do you need to be?\"</p> <p>Pfizer boss Ian Read spent a second day touring City investors on Thursday to press the case for his bid. </p> <p>Soriot was meanwhile attempting to woo his shareholders \u2013 many of whom are also big Pfizer investors \u2013 by talking up AstraZeneca's cancer pipeline.</p> <p>He said the value of the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker's pipeline will crystallise in the company's share price long before 2023.</p> <p>By that date the company expects a 75% uplift in annual revenues to more than $45bn.</p> <p>Soriot pointed to other companies that have turned themselves around \u2013 such as Bristol Myers-Squibb in the US.</p> <p>Analysts believe Pfizer will raise its proposal to \u00a353-\u00a355 a share from \u00a350 two weeks ago.</p> <p>One large investor said: \"The ball is now in Pfizer's court to see if they can find an offer which brings Astra to the table. They can go hostile, though that is risky.</p> <p>\"We have indicated that we think [AstraZeneca] should consider, talking but there needs to be an inducement to talk and in that sense it's Pfizer decision.\"</p> <p>AstraZeneca has not suffered any setbacks through drugs failing in development in the last eight months.</p> <p>Soriot noted that lung drug AZD9291, which new data shows shrank tumours in over half of patients, the cancer immunotherapy PD-L1 treatment, and asthma medicines benralizumab and tralokinumab, have all been engineered in Cambrige. \"We are very much rooted in science in this country.\"</p> <p>AstraZeneca's defence was strengthened by the release of promising clinical data ahead of a key cancer US conference, which Soriot, a biologist, plans to attend.</p> <p>He reminded his shareholders that they would receive cash and shares in the new company, which is why its strategy and integration are crucial.</p> <p>\"Would it be a strategy that is science led with an investment in R&amp;D or would it be a strategy of: we cut costs and we maximise short-term cashflow?\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theantworks.com/industry-report/pfizer-az/\" title=\"\">research by Amsterdam-based AntWorks</a> shows that Pfizer is already dominant in over 80% of the therapeutic areas of both companies combined.</p> <p>Given the vast overlap, \"it is unlikely that AstraZeneca's R&amp;D departments will feel secure about their futures.\"</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sean Farrell</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Hayward's appointment as chairman of Glencore Xstrata is causing controversy in the City, with some investors ready to demand meetings with top officials from the commodities conglomerate. One institutional investor has sold off its entire holding in the business over concerns that Hayward \u2013 the former boss of BP who was forced out of the oil multinational in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico four years ago \u2013 is to take over as chairman of the company created through the controversial merger of Glencore and Xstrata. Some investors had wanted a chairman from outside the business to be appointed in an attempt to refresh the boardroom. Glencore is the only FTSE-100 company with no female directors, despite calls by the business secretary, Vince Cable, for 30% of the seats in FTSE-100 boardrooms to be held by women. Hayward was already on the board and has been acting chairman since Sir John Bond was ousted at last year's annual general meeting. Bond was unable to chair the meeting in Zug, Switzerland, a year ago because he had failed to be elected by big institutional investors who had cast their votes ahead of the meeting. Some 80% of investors had voted against Bond, who used to run HSBC and was also chairman of Vodafone, and Hayward stepped in on the day to chair the meeting and to temporarily take the helm of the commodity company. The latest controversy is taking place just before his year's annual meeting \u2013 scheduled for Tuesday in Zug. Hayward was named permanent chairman last week. A well-known fund management group said: \"We have sold our holding [in Glencore] because we think external investors made it clear that Tony Hayward was not their choice. His appointment suggests a company that is public but feels like it is being run as a private company.\" Many investors will have already cast their votes by proxy ahead of this year's AGM, with expectations that investors may express their disillusionment by voting against Hayward's election to the board or against the chair of the nomination's committee, Peter Grauer. They might also refuse to approve the report and accounts. Hayward is best known for his time at BP where he caused controversy by saying \"I want my life back\" in the midst of the oil spill that polluted the Gulf of Mexico and killed 11 people. Hayward left BP in July 2010. When his permanent appointment was announced last week, Grauer had described him as the \"outstanding candidate to take on the role permanently. \"We continue to look forward to harnessing his in-depth knowledge of the resources industry and of listed company governance to underpin the mandate given to him as chairman to lead the board in helping to deliver long-term, sustainable returns for shareholders,\" Grauer said. The company declined to comment further, but at the time of Hayward's appointment said there had been an \"extensive search process\". It has been reported that there were two other candidates for chairman: the former BG boss Sir Frank Chapman and Roger Agnelli, former boss of the iron-ore miner Vale.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "National Grid is preparing to start talks over which future energy supplies could be cut off to some businesses between 4pm and 8pm in an attempt to head off a power crunch and blackouts this coming winter. The move was revealed as the group reported annual profits for last year of \u00a32.6bn and triggered criticism for paying out a dividend of more than \u00a31bn to shareholders. The Grid, which operates the gas pipes and electricity pylons, signalled it would begin talks with about a dozen customers shortly in an attempt to encourage them to sign multi-year deals under which they would agree to have their energy supplies cut off this and following winters in return for significant discounts in the bills. \"We have new tools in place given to us by (regulator) Ofgem that allows us to do this. We will consider in the coming weeks whether we are going to exercise those rights,\" said Steve Holliday. The Grid chief executive declined to say what the final decision would be but clearly signalled that it was highly likely he would press ahead to try this type of mutually-agreed demand reduction. The Grid is considering plans which would take 850 megawatts off the system during week days with the cost of the scheme being passed on to customers. Ofgem has previously promised that it would cost household customers less than \u00a31 per annum. Many of the Grid customers are aggregators, companies such as Utilyx, which buy power on behalf of smaller energy users, and the Grid wants to tie up agreements well in advance of the winter. The power network operator also wants the deals to cover subsequent winters as Britain is considered vulnerable to outages at least until 2018 when there is hope a new range of power stations will come on stream. But Holliday insists that while surplus supply capacity is lower than it has been the likely decision to introduce new interruptible contracts is not a sign of panic or expectation of outages. \"I am not uncomfortable but neither am I complacent. It is my job to worry about this,\" he adds. The Grid will also hope to agree contracts with power stations to bring extra reserve energy on stream at periods of peak demand. Meanwhile, the Grid trumpeted a \"solid year of financial performance\" that saw pre-tax profits rise by 2% year on year and earnings per share increase 5% to 54p. The \u00a31bn dividend payout was condemned by consumer energy campaigners who said excess cash should be ploughed back into the energy network to help reduce soaring energy bills. \"With the National Grid networks costs now accounting for nearly a fifth of the average energy bill hard-up households will surely be shaking their heads in despair at yet another huge payout for shareholders profiteering from their high energy bill misery,\" argued Clare Welton, Fuel Poverty Action But Holliday said the business had performed well even during the storms of the winter and he insisted customers as well as shareholders stood to gain from an efficiency drive under new regulatory conditions. \"During the year we have invested over \u00a33.4bn in essential infrastructure while delivering one of our best years ever in terms of network reliability and resilience. At the same time we delivered strong cost efficiencies, particularly in the UK (as opposed to the US) where around \u00a370m of the savings will benefit customer bills starting in 2015/16.\"",

An already feeble recovery lost momentum in the first three months of 2014 and the signs are no better for the current quarter. The 18-nation single currency area is nowhere near achieving escape velocity, the rate of expansion that would start to make inroads into mass unemployment and prevent the drift towards deflation. Action from the European Central Bank next month is inevitable.</p> <p>The nugatory growth in early 2014 was all the more disappointing because of an unusually mild winter. That had led economists to expect activity to pick up by 0.4%; instead it was just half that figure, a weaker performance than in the final three months of 2013. Had it not been for the robust growth posted by Germany, things would look even more dismal.</p> <p>Some of the weather-related boost to output will be paid back in the second quarter. In addition, there have been signs recently that the tension in Ukraine is eating into business and consumer confidence. China's slowdown will have an impact on Germany's export-dependent economy. For those reasons, it is hard to see growth accelerating in the second quarter.....</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/may/15/eurozone-recovery-ecb-inevitable\">Eurozone recovery: time to call the ECB - but what's the number?</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5374be4de4b0e9ce777ba11b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-15T13:19:36.860Z\">2.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Maybe the US economy isn't healing as well as we thought.</b> Industrial output across the country fell by 0.6% in April, defying expectations it would be unchanged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/statuses/466930069215399936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Can we blame weather still in US !!</p>&mdash; Steve Collins (@TradeDesk_Steve) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/statuses/466930069215399936\">May 15, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC/statuses/466930693755633664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>April U.S. industrial production down 0.6% after two months of strong growth: <a href=\"http://t.co/9wU7Iq08jO\">http://t.co/9wU7Iq08jO</a></p>&mdash; CNBC (@CNBC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC/statuses/466930693755633664\">May 15, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5374bc12e4b0750615b051bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-15T13:16:32.601Z\">2.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-254d131f-74b6-4ba0-ba11-ec0e0fed08bf\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/15/1400159457136/649003b5-9d80-4a62-962c-ca069194bfd0-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Protests in Athens, May 15 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protests in Athens today.

      "bodyText": "And that's all for tonight. Thanks for reading, and for all the comments. A quick reminder of the key points: Economists are urging the ECB to take fresh action at next month's meeting, after the latest GDP data showed Europe's recovery remained week. Reaction starts here The eurozone economy grew by just 0.2% in the first three months of 2014, only half as fast as expected. While Germany outperformed with a 0.8% expansion, most other countries faltered. France was stagnant, Italy and Portugal contracted, and the Netherlands' GDP shrank sharply (although a mild winter was partly to blame). Full coverage starts here. Here's Larry Elliott's analysis Two top US economists have hailed the appointment of Kristin Forbes to the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Forbes, a former White House advisor and current MIT professor, was named as the next interest rate setter by the chancellor George Osborne today. Stocks and peripheral bonds have fallen today, as disappointing US data - and rumours that the Greek government could tax bond-holders -- hit sentiment. There have been fresh protests in Athens, ahead of the Euro elections. Catch you tomorrow. GW We often talk about France being the sick man of Europe, but Capital Economics flags up that Italy is the real problem child - and here's the evidence: Their analyst Andrew Kenningham argues: First, although many in the markets now assume that the Bank of England will raise interest rates at least as soon as the Fed, the gulf in the levels of GDP in the two countries suggests that there is a lot more spare capacity in the UK. Largely for that reason, we think the Bank of England will probably keep its policy rates lower for longer. Second, the focus on levels rather than growth rates underlines that it is Italy, rather than France, which is the true \u201csick man\u201d of Europe. Nonetheless, the data also highlight how France is again falling behind Germany. Moreover, we think France is likely to fall further behind in the coming years because it has much more serious structural problems and, unlike Germany, will also need to tighten fiscal policy. Europe's stock markets have closed with losses across the board -- particularly in the peripheral countries. Italy's FTSE MIB is the big faller, shedding almost 3.7%. There are also heavy losses in Portugal (-2.8%), and Spain (-2%). And as flagged up at 3.44pm, there's been a selloff in peripheral bonds too. The appointment of Kristin Forbes to the Bank of England's rate-setting committee has been hailed by two top US academics, who say she's a great addition to the UK central bank. Professor Simon Johnson, an MIT colleague of Forbes, told my colleague Larry Elliott: \"I know her very well. She's a terrific appointment. It's an extremely good idea for any central bank to bring in outside perspectives from people who understand how a globalised world works, including people with policy experiences.\" Johnson said it was \"standing room only\" for Forbes's lectures at the Sloan Business School at MIT, adding: \"She is one of our most successful teachers. She is a great communicator, who takes complex ideas and makes them understandable without losing any of the nuances.\" Johnson added that Forbes was considered the world's leading expert on capital flows across countries and had also written an influential paper on inequality. Harvard professor Ken Rogoff said the assumption in the US was that Forbes would get a top economics job in the US if the Republicans win back the White House - either as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers or by joining the Federal Reserve, America's central bank. \"She's a very clear and articulate economist\", Rogoff said. \"She doesn't come with any preconceived notions. She is very strong on international macro-economic issues\". The other reason for today's selloff is that US factory orders for March have been revised down, to +0.9% from +1.1% before. That suggests the US economy actually contracted in the first three months of this year, by more than -0.2% (or -0.9% on the annualised favoured by American economists). There's a real risk-off feeling in the market this afternoon, sending bond markets sliding and also hitting sovereign debt issued by Italy, Spain and Greece. The FTSE 100 isn't immune either, with the blue chip index shedding 52 points to 6825, a fall of 0.7%. No chance of hitting the alltime high of 6930 achieved at the end of 1999. Italian government bonds have fallen sharply, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year bonds to 3.07% from 2.91% last night.That's a significant move in one day, but also means Italian bonds are still rather highly valued. (remember the days of 2011, when yields topped 7%?) So what's happened? One factor is the news that US industrial production fell 0.6% last month (as mentioned earlier). But traders were also spooked by a report Greece might impose a retrospective capital gains tax on foreign bond-buyers, who have made large profits on Greek debt. It's been denied by Athens, but Greek bonds are still suffering. That's pushed their 10-year bond yields up to 6.8%, from 6.3%. Quite a big move Today's weak GDP data is weighing on Europe's stock markets. The Italian FTSE MIB has now shed 2.7%, or 573 points to 20,612, following the news that the Italian economy shrank by 0.1%. And the Spanish IBEX has fallen 2%, even though its economy grew by 0.5% in the first quarter. According to sources, the Treasury wrote to 80 potential candidates suggesting they might apply for the vacancy on the Monetary Policy Committee -- before ultimately appointing US academic Dr Kristin Forbes. Larry Elliott writes: The Treasury said there had been 34 applications for the MPC job after it was advertised last month, ten of which were from women. A three-person panel including Kate Barker, the last woman on the committee, conducted interviews and made recommendations to the chancellor. Treasury sources said there had been an effort to find more women applicants. Dave Ramsden, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, sent out 80 emails to potential candidates, split evenly between men and women. Kristin Forbes joins Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee Back to the big story of the morning, Europe's weak growth figures. Economics editor Larry Elliott writes that Mario Draghi should consider copying the UK's Funding for Lending Scheme, to drive lending in the euro area. It's really not happening in the eurozone. An already feeble recovery lost momentum in the first three months of 2014 and the signs are no better for the current quarter. The 18-nation single currency area is nowhere near achieving escape velocity, the rate of expansion that would start to make inroads into mass unemployment and prevent the drift towards deflation. Action from the European Central Bank next month is inevitable. The nugatory growth in early 2014 was all the more disappointing because of an unusually mild winter. That had led economists to expect activity to pick up by 0.4%; instead it was just half that figure, a weaker performance than in the final three months of 2013. Had it not been for the robust growth posted by Germany, things would look even more dismal. Some of the weather-related boost to output will be paid back in the second quarter. In addition, there have been signs recently that the tension in Ukraine is eating into business and consumer confidence. China's slowdown will have an impact on Germany's export-dependent economy. For those reasons, it is hard to see growth accelerating in the second quarter..... More here: Eurozone recovery: time to call the ECB - but what's the number? Maybe the US economy isn't healing as well as we thought. Industrial output across the country fell by 0.6% in April, defying expectations it would be unchanged. Over to Greece, where the countdown to European and local elections (the first round of the latter taking place this weekend) has sent passions skyrocketing. Protestors, including fired school guards who have been demonstrating outside the country\u2019s administrative reform ministry since early this morning, see the double poll as the ideal chance to vent their spleen. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: The mood outside the administrative reform ministry is as explosive as each of the protestors now gathered outside it. With dismissed school guards vowing to remain on the streets \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d authorities have dispatched vanloads of riot police to the area. Scuffles have intermittently broken out as the guards, who were laid off as part of plans to streamline Greece\u2019s bloated public sector, have tried to enter the building. Harris Bastas who heads the group now representing the 2,000 offloaded school guards told me: \u201cright now we want to meet the minister [Kyriakos Mitsotakis] and if it takes one, two, three days we will stay here. In fact as long as it takes. Our basic demand is to be reinstated. We want the jobs that we lost in one night,\u201d he yelled, screaming himself hoarse. \u201cWe want what every state should guarantee its citizens: the right to live with dignity.\u201d Mitsotakis, who is under immense pressure to trim the civil service from Greece\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF, has shown no inclination to meet the guards. Down the road irate finance ministry cleaners, who also lost their jobs at the end of March after being put into a special labour reserve, are similarly demonstrating. Now the emblem of austerity\u2019s corrosive effects, the women have become increasingly organised, establishing a stall outside the national economy ministry from where they distribute leaflets describing their plight. Our full story on the IMF's warning to France is now live: France must not renege on spending cuts programme, warns IMF Just in - the number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit has dropped to its lowest level in seven years. Just 297,000 new jobless claims were filed last week, the lowest level since May 2007 (the dawn of the credit crunch) And the US inflation rate has also picked up by its fastest rate since last July. The consumer prices index rose by 2.0% on an annual basis in April, with prices up by 0.3% month-on-month. Two signs that the US economy is picking up pace, after stalling over the winter. Here's some instant reaction to Kristin Forbes's appointment to the Bank of England's monetary policy committee: Dr Kristin Forbes, the US academic just named as the newest member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, is an expert in \"financial contagion\". Bloomberg wrote last year that: When Kristin Forbes sought tenure at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyearly last decade, some colleagues said her research focus on financial contagion led to a dead end. Her reaction: Full speed ahead. Forbes worked to safeguard global financial stability with then-U.S. Treasury Undersecretary John Taylor, became the youngest member ever on the White House Council of Economic Advisers and eventually won tenure at MIT. In August she presented the opening paper at the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \u201cKristin is one of the leaders in the empirical analysis of contagion,\u201d said Roberto Rigobon, who, like Forbes, is a professor of economics at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has co-written research with her on the topic. \u201cHer papers are a tour de force for anyone interested in measuring\u201d its \u201cimportance, existence and extent.\u201d Here's the full profile: Contagion Thesis Once Derided Proven by Kristin Forbes Just in: the next member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee has been named. Dr Kristin Forbes, currently Professor of Management and Global Economics at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management, will join the rate-setting committee in July. Chancellor George Osborne says Forbes is \"an economist of outstanding ability with real practical experience of policy making. She will make an exceptionally strong addition to the MPC. It's a sign of the high regard in which the Bank of England and our monetary framework are held around the world that someone of Kristin's ability wishes to be part of them\u201d. According to Forbes' web page at MIT, she was the youngest ever person to serve on the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. She's also worked for the U.S. Treasury Department, and was a Davos \"young Global Leader\". In addition: She is a research associate at the NBER and a member of the Bellagio Group, Trilateral Commission, and Council on Foreign Relations. She is on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the Congressional Budget Office and the Academic Advisory Board for the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the Center for Global Development. She has won numerous teaching awards and teaches one of the most popular classes at MIT's Sloan School. Before joining MIT, Forbes worked at the World Bank and Morgan Stanley. Correction, the chairman of Lloyds is Lord Blackwell, not Sir Win Bischoff (Blackwell's predecessor) as I wrote earlier. As if France wasn't under enough pressure, the International Monetary Fund has dealt Francois Hollande another blow by questioning whether his new fiscal plan is achievable. In a new review of the French economy, the IMF questioned whether France will manage to cut public spending fast enough to bring its deficit down to 3% by 2015, given Hollande's pledge to also cut payroll taxes (paid by on companies). The IMF warned that France cannot afford to waver on its spending cuts: \"Achieving the deficit objectives while delivering on the tax cut commitments leaves no room to deviate from the announced expenditure reductions,\" the IMF said in a regular review on the French economy. \"The major risks are that the initial plans may be diluted in sequential annual budgets and that cuts in transfers to local governments may be compensated by unsustainable cuts in investment, higher taxes or higher debt,\" Good news - the security scare at the Bank of England is over. The chairman of Lloyds Banking Group, Lord Blackwell, Sir Win Bischoff, has told shareholders at the bank's AGM in Edinburgh today that the Scottish referendum on independence means \"uncertainties for everyone\". But Blackwell also said Lloyds didn't hold a 'corporate view' - it's a matter for Scotland. Via Reuters: 15-May-2014 12:22 - LLOYDS BANK CHAIR SAYS 'UNCERTAINTIES FOR EVERYONE' AHEAD OF SCOTS INDEPENDENCE VOTE 15-May-2014 12:17 - LLOYDS BANK CHAIRMAN SAYS NOT PLANNING ANY MOVES AHEAD OF SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE VOTE 15-May-2014 12:18 - LLOYDS BANK CHAIR SAYS WILL WORK WITH RELEVANT AUTHORITIES IN EVENT SCOTS VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE 15-May-2014 12:21 - LLOYDS BANK CHAIR SAYS INDEPENDENCE MATTER FOR SCOTS, BANK HOLDS NO CORPORATE VIEW Meanwhile in the City, the Bank of England has announced that it has moved staff to \"safe areas\", as police investigate a car which has been abandoned outside the central bank headquarters. Work continues as usual (despite the Bank tube station area being cordoned off), and there' s no reaction in the financial markets. Here's the BoE statement: Bank of England response to suspect vehicle Following reports of a suspect vehicle near the Bank of England, the Bank has moved staff to safe areas of the building. All essential operations continue from those areas. The Evening Standard has more details. Today's growth (and non-growth) readings are a \"sobering reminder\" that the eurozone isn't out of the woods yet, says Aengus Collins, Europe Analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit. He writes: Over the past year or so, most forecasters have been toning down the language that they use in relation to the euro zone's economic woes, with Mario Draghi's monetary activism (by ECB standards, at any rate) seen as a game-changer. In some respects that is correct. The euro zone is no longer gripped by a crisis of existential proportions. But this morning's data highlight the fact that the absence of crisis isn't the same as the presence of recovery. And while Germany is recovering strongly, this isn't feeding through to its neighbours, Collins added: France stagnated in the first quarter and Italy contracted. These two major economies are struggling to sustain even a tentative recovery. Italy is now likely to expand only slightly for the full year (and it would take very little for it to contract) while the first quarter in France will shave a few tenths off growth for the year that was already relatively weak at 0.8%. Also of concern is the sharp contraction of 0.7% recorded in Portugal, just as that country prepares to exit its EU/IMF bailout. Analysts at BNP Paribas agree that the ECB must act in June, especially as Mario Draghi said last week that the governing council is not happy about the path of inflation. The European Central Bank cannot leave monetary policy unchanged at next month's meeting, argues James Ashley, chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets: \"The debate over 'whether' to act is surely over and it is now just a question of 'how' to act.\" Yesterday, it emerged that the ECB is preparing a package of possible measures - from cutting interest rates to stimulating small business lending. Tom Rogers, senior economic adviser at EY, said today's data should be \"a wake-up call\" for any eurozone policy makers who are complacent that Europe is safely on the road to recovery: Rogers argues that Italy and France are paying the price for not reforming their economies (via AP): \"Stagnating output in Italy and France, two of the four largest economies, is in large part a result of deteriorating cost-competitiveness, while Germany and Spain continue to reap rewards from reform implemented either well before the crisis, or more recently.\" Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight is hopeful that the eurozone will pick up momentum through this year (recent surveys have been quite positive), arguing: Reduced fiscal squeezes, very accommodative monetary policy (which now seems likely to augmented in June) and sharply reduced sovereign debt tensions are supportive to Eurozone growth, while global growth is seen picking up gradually. In addition, consumers' purchasing power is being helped by muted consumer price inflation (just 0.7% across the Eurozone in April) while Eurozone labour markets have largely stabilized and in some cases are even improving modestly. (the -1.4% contraction at the bottom of the chart is the Netherlands, if you can't see it clearly) On a brighter note, Europe did grow faster than the US for the first time in three years. Bad weather left the American economy struggling to expand over the winter -- its GDP rose by just 0.05% on a quarterly basis. You can see all the Eurostat data here (pdf) Ahha! This chart, from the brighter sparks at MacroPolis shows how Greece's economy may have clawed its way back to stagnation. The wider European Union grew by +0.3% during the first quarter, beating the eurozone's +0.2% growth. Strong growth in the UK (+0.8%), Hungary and Poland (both 1.1% q-on-q) helped the EU outpace the euro area. That means the EU economy is 1.4% larger than in the first quarter of 2013, according to Eurostat, while the eurozone is +0.9% larger. Greece's economy has contracted by around a fifth since the crisis began, and is currently 1.1% smaller than a year ago. Here's a chart from Trading Economics showing the details: Cyprus continued to suffer from its austerity programme, and the trauma of last year's bailout crisis which left its banking sector on the mat. The Cypriot economy shrank by 0.7% during the last quarter, and is now 4.1% smaller than a year ago. Is there a glimmer of hope in Greece's GDP data, just released? Greece's economy has shrunk by 1.1% over the last year, which is the smallest annual contraction since the debt crisis began in 2010. That's also less severe than the 1.5% slump which economists expected. I\"m afraid we don't get quarter-on-quarter data for Greece -- ie, how it fared since the October-December period. So we don't have a quarterly growth data. Not only is Europe struggling to grow, its inflation rate is worrying low. Eurostat reports that prices rose by just 0.7% across the euro area in April, which confirmed its flash estimate. That's well shy of the European Central Bank's target of just below 2% . BAD NEWS: The Eurozone grew by just 0.2% in the first three months of this year, dragged down by stagnation in France, and contraction in Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands (see earlier summary). That's much weaker than the 0.4% growth that analysts had expected, and raises fresh fears that the eurozone recovery is running out of steam. Reaction to follow! Time for a very brisk recap before we get the overall figure for Eurozone GDP at 10am sharp (and updated inflation data too): And the big picture is that the eurozone recovery story has taken a battering this morning with only Germany outperforming in the first three months of 2014. German GDP beat forecasts, growing by 0.8%, thanks to a mild winter and solid demand from home and abroad. But France's economy has stalled, with GDP unchanged in the quarter. Italy is shrinking again, with GDP down 0.1% - ending its short escape from contraction Portugal has suffered a contraction, down 0.7%. The Netherlands economy suffered from the warm winter, with GDP shrinking by an alarming 1.4%. Austria grew by just 0.3% And Finland is in recession, after GDP fell by 0.4% And here's the latest reaction: And now we get bad news from Portugal -- its GDP fell by 0.7% in the first three months of this year, dashing hopes that it would keep expanding. It's one disappointment after another.... apart from Germany Finland has also added to the gloom in the eurozone, sliding into recession with a 0.4% drop in GDP in the first three months of this year. That follows a 0.3% contraction in Q4, and economists are concerned that the once-healthy Finnish economy is on the slide. As Nordea analyst Jan Von Gerich put it: \"It doesn't look too good\", adding: \"Zero growth from the full-year is starting to look like an achievement for the economy \"If the situation in Russia gets worse, it will become a year of contraction.\" Andrew Balls, deputy chief investment officer at Pimco (and brother of the UK shadow chancellor) is discussing the eurozone GDP data on Bloomberg TV now. On today's laggards, France and Italy, Balls says that \"two countries* who have not done a lot of economic] reforms are broadly flat in terms of activity.\" But he is more optimistic about the eurozone as whole, which is returning to trend-like growth....\"a big improvement on where have been in recent years\". Spain, and many smaller countries are also doing quite well, Balls adds (Spanish GDP was released last week, and rose by 0.4%) * - not countries as I initially mistyped - apologies all We also have decent growth data from Poland - the economy grew by 3.3% over the last year (I can't find quarter-on-quarter figures, sorry) That's good, but not quite as good as Hungary's 3.5% annual growth (which I covered here) This chart, from ISTAT, shows how the Italian economy is shrinking again (-0.1%) having grown by just 0.1% in October-December after shrinking for nine straight quarters. ITALY'S ECONOMY HAS CONTRACTED AGAIN. Italian GDP fell by 0.1% in the first quarter of the year, dashing hopes of 0.2% growth. That's an alarming development. Italy had only just clawed its way out of recession three months ago. Today's data means it has contracted by 0.5% over the last year. For all the talk of European recovery, Italy is still in a mess. The euro has fallen this morning, as the weak French growth figures put more pressure on the ECB to act. It's dropped 0.3% to $1.3673 Another gloomy statistics in the Dutch GDP report -- in the first quarter of 2014 there were 112 thousand employee jobs less than a year earlier. But the Central Bureau of Statistics also struck a note of optimism, saying Netherlands' industrial base continued to recover. Shocking figures from the Netherlands. Its economy shrunk by 1.4% in the first three months of this year, much worse than the 0.0% which economists had expected. That means its economy has contracted by 0.5% since the first quarter of 2013. So what on earth happened? The Netherlands Statistics Office blames lower gas consumption, due to the very mild winter. Apparently this meant natural gas consumption by households was almost a third lower than a year earlier. Consumers also spent less on food and beverage, partly because Easter in 2014 fell in April rather than March. This chart (via Yannis Koutsomitis) shows how Germany has now posted its strongest period of growth since 2011, having grown by 0.8% in the last quarter. (the blue line is Markit's monthly PMI survey of business leaders) Germany's DAX stock index has just hit a new record high, as traders in Frankfurt react to the news that German growth beat forecasts in the last three months. GERMANY'S DAX .GDAXI HITS ALL-TIME HIGH AT 9,810.29 POINTS - RTRS The FTSE 100 index is up 12 points this morning at 6890 points --marching towards the alltime closing high of 6930 set in 1999. France's CAC index is lagging, down 0.1%. The Czech Republic has matched France's weak performance, with no growth at all in the last quarter. That's actually better than expected -- economists had feared a 0.2% contraction, following strong growth in Q4 2013. The Czech stats body says manufacturing has recovered from a low base in 2013 (hurt by an 18-month recession), thanks to growing demand from abroad and at home. Romania's economy appears to have slowed in January-March, with quarterly growth of just 0.1%. But year on year, its economy has grown by 3.8%, ahead of forecasts (according to Reuters), thanks to strong exports. Hungary has beaten expectations with some healthy-looking GDP data. Its economy grew by 1.1% in the last quarter, and is 3.5% larger than a year ago. The Central Statistics Office said the Hungarian construction and industry firms drove growth. Austria's economy grew by just 0.3% in the first three months of 2014, weaker than the 0.5% expected. And growth in the final quarter of 2013 has been revised up to +0.4%, from +0.3% initially. Statistics body WIFO reported that domestic consumption was weak, although exports were stronger. Exports rose by 1.5% in the quarter, WIFO said, while imports were up by 1.1%. France's stagnation means it will be much harder for Paris to achieve its goal of 1% growth through 2014.... Another missed target for Hollande, who didn't manage to get unemployment falling by the end of 2013 either... Readers are already having their say in the comments below (thanks, as ever, all of you). Please keep them coming . Here's some early reaction: Coming up... There's lots more GDP data to come, including Austria and Slovakia in a few moments (8am BST) The Netherlands at 8.30 a.m. Italy at 9am The eurozone as a whole: 10am Antonio Garcia Pascual, chief eurozone economist at Barclays, says France's economy was dragged back by \"very weak\" business investment and household consumption during the last quarter. He's particularly concerned about the 0.9% drop in investment -- which suggests anxiety about Francois Hollande's economic programme, including tens of billions of euros of cuts to public spending over the next few years. Breaking away to the UK briefly, Carphone Warehouse and Dixons have agreed to merge and create a new high street giant. The new company, called \"Dixons Carphone plc\", is designed to create \"a leader in European consumer electricals, mobiles, connectivity and related services\" (they say here) It brings together Carphone's mobile technology outlets and Dixons electrical shops (fastFT neatly dubs it the \"tablets meet toasters\" merger). The deal is worth \u00a33.7bn. Carphone chairman Charlie Dunstone reckons: \"This is a new chapter for both businesses and we are energised and proud to be part of what will be another fantastic journey for consumers and shareholders.\" There is SOME good news for France, alongside its disappointing growth data. INSEE has revised last year's data, and concluded that the French economy was larger than it first thought in 2012. This means last year's debt-to-GDP ratio has been cut to 91.8%, from 93.5%, while the public deficit was revised down to 4.2% from 4.3%. That makes it a little easier for Paris to meet the deficit targets agreed with Brussels. Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet is also struck by the comparison between Europe's two largest economies. The UK also grew by 0.8% in the January-March quarter, according to data released last month, matching Germany's performance (let's hope this doesn't go to penalties) Economist Shaun Richards flags up another worrying point in today's data -- French imports rose in the last quarter, while exports slowed down. The German finance ministry says the country's economy benefitted from a mild winter, and decent domestic demand. GERMANY beats forecasts - with growth of 0.8% in the first quarter of 2014. That's a little stronger than expected (economists expected +0.7%). SUCH a contrast with France's stagnation.... As well as that 0.5% slump in French household spending, INSEE also reports that capital spending dropped by 0.9% in the last quarter. This chart from INSEE shows how inventories rose, suggesting companies stockpiled goods as demand wavered. The full statement is here on INSEE's website. Jonathan Ferro of Bloomberg sums France's (non) growth figures up: So why couldn't the French economy grow in the last three months? Dominique Barbet, an economist at BNP Paribas SA in Paris, tells Bloomberg that consumer spending (which fell 0.5%) dragged down the economy. He's concerned that France's growth prospects look rather modest. \u201cWhat\u2019s worrying beyond the first quarter is that the level of growth is weak. There\u2019s no acceleration. We don\u2019t have the recovery that other countries are seeing.\u201d Eurozone GDP day has begun with bad news -- the French economy stagnated during the first three months of 2014 as consumer spending slumped. INSEE reports that GDP was unchanged over the quarter, a new blow to Francois Hollande's already pummelled government. Economists had expected growth of 0.2% -- which would have been bad enough. INSEE reported that consumer spending fell 0.5% in the first quarter, showing French households are struggling. Investment by nonfinancial companies also fell 0.5%. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. And we're heavily focused on the eurozone today, with the release of new growth data from across the region for the first three months of 2014. It'll show whether Europe's economy continued to claw its way back from the recession which ended last summer. And there's particular focus on France, given fears that the second largest country in the euro area is struggling. I'll be covering all the data for the next few hours, building up to the overall eurozone growth figure at 10am BST.",

    "webTitle": "Gary Becker obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Described by Milton Friedman as \"the greatest social scientist who has lived and worked in the last half-century\", Gary Becker, who has died aged 83, carried out research that traversed at least a dozen different areas of economics, from black markets to racial discrimination, from crime and punishment to human capital. His pioneering of rational choice theory \u2013 the concept that individuals will pursue the most cost-effective means to achieve their intended outcome \u2013 extended the boundaries of economics, and made the discipline relevant to a wide range of human activities. Becker continued to be heavily involved in economic policy discussions right up to his death \u2013 through speaking engagements, columns and his excellent blog. Becker was born in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, one of four children of Anna (nee Siskind) and Louis Becker. In the mid-1930s, the family moved to Brooklyn, New York, where Becker went to school. He studied mathematics at Princeton University in 1951, and completed his PhD at the University of Chicago in 1955, working closely with Friedman. Friedman reignited in Becker an interest in economics that had faded at university, by emphasising that \"economics was not a game played by academics, but a tool to analyse the real world\". After three years as an assistant professor at Chicago, Becker taught at Columbia University, New York, between 1957 and 1969, during which time he received the John Bates Clark medal awarded by the American Economic Association. He returned to Chicago in 1970, becoming professor of economics and sociology at the university and the Booth School of Business. Becker challenged the idea that economic analysis should be restricted to markets. His efforts to move economic analysis to non-market subjects such as racial discrimination, families, organ donation and immigration were initially dismissed by both economists and social scientists, and much of his research proved highly controversial. One of his most interesting areas of study was into the economic incentives of crime (an idea that occurred to him as he considered parking illegally). He calculated that he was unlikely to be caught, and that the fine for being caught was not great enough to be a deterrent. He surmised that others might make the same calculation. This analysis has been the victim of straw-man arguments claiming that Becker believed crime was simply a matter of economic incentives. Becker always acknowledged the \"human\" element in the commission of crime (that most people operate under high moral constraints) and simply argued that incentives had a significant effect on our decisions and actions. The economic incentives driving family life were another controversial, but important, area that Becker investigated. His work on the effects of education and the empowerment of women upon marriage, divorce and fertility rates culminated in A Treatise on the Family (1981). Becker was among the first economists to discuss the economic consequences of racial discrimination. He argued that discrimination against ethnic minorities could have real and significant negative economic effects on the discriminator, through higher costs. However, he also accepted that free competition alone would not eradicate discrimination. In recent years, it was Becker's arguments on the benefits of a free market in human organs that proved most controversial. He and his co-writer, Julio Jorge Elias, put a price on human body parts, and posited that this would help increase the number of organ donations. Becker won the Nobel prize for economic sciences in 1992 for his work in \"extending microeconomic analysis to a range of human activity, including non-market behaviour\". He received the US national medal of science in 2000 and the presidential medal of freedom in 2007. One of his theories with most resonance for the UK springs from his work on immigration. Presenting the Hayek memorial lecture at the Institute of Economic Affairs in London in 2010, Becker laid out an alternative to the nationalistic posturing that is often part of the immigration debate. Accepting that a policy of open borders was impossible, given the existence of welfare states, he argued for a market-based approach to immigration that would allow migrants to pay a fee for entry. This would be supported by a system of loans to allow low-income migrants to move to the UK. It was the sort of radical alternative that Becker was willing and able to offer in a number of policy areas. If there is one economist who can legitimately be called a giant of the discipline upon whose shoulders future generations will stand, Becker, with his trailblazing application of economics to aspects of everyday life, is a candidate for that title. He changed the nature of economics and made it relevant to entirely new spheres of human life and interaction. It shows his impact that his methods of economic analysis \u2013 derided when he introduced them \u2013 have now become the tools used by the very best researchers across criminology, sociology and other social sciences. In 1954, he married Doria Slote. She died in 1969. He is survived by his second wife, Guity Nashat, whom he married in 1980; by two daughters, Catherine and Judy, from his first marriage; and by two grandchildren. \u2022 Gary Stanley Becker, economist, born 2 December 1930; died 3 May 2014",

      "bodyText": "The French government risks failing to deliver on \u20ac50bn (\u00a340.8bn) of spending cuts, threatening plans to get the deficit under control, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The IMF, based in Washington, said Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's government was faced with a large challenge to bring the deficit down but must not renege on the spending cuts which are planned for the next three years. The IMF said the spending cuts would be \"remarkable by historical standards\", but were necessary to offset tax cuts and bring the public finances under control. It said in an update on France: \"Achieving the deficit objectives while delivering on the tax cut commitments leaves no room to deviate from the announced expenditure reductions. \"The major risks are that the initial plans may be diluted in sequential annual budgets and that cuts in transfers to local governments may be compensated by unsustainable cuts in investment, higher taxes or higher debt. This would undermine the government's fiscal rebalancing strategy.\" The spending cuts are considered crucial if France is to bring its deficit in line with the EU-agreed target of 3% of GDP next year. Hollande has already pledged to cut payroll tax on companies and has offered tax relief for low-income households. The IMF suggested the French economy was fragile, with a risk that growth in 2014 and 2015 would come in below its central forecast of 1% and 1.5% respectively. Inflation is expected to remain weak at about 1%. \"All of this will make the task of the authorities very difficult.

The 18-nation single currency area is nowhere near achieving escape velocity, the rate of expansion that would start to make inroads into mass unemployment and prevent the drift towards deflation. Action from the European Central Bank next month is inevitable. The nugatory growth in early 2014 was all the more disappointing because of an unusually mild winter. That had led economists to expect activity to pick up by 0.4%; instead it was just half that figure, a weaker performance than in the final three months of 2013. Had it not been for the robust growth posted by Germany, things would look even more dismal. Some of the weather-related boost to output will be paid back in the second quarter. In addition, there have been signs recently that the tension in Ukraine is eating into business and consumer confidence. China's slowdown will have an impact on Germany's export-dependent economy. For those reasons, it is hard to see growth accelerating in the second quarter. That, though, is not the end of the eurozone's problems. The commercial banks are still weak following the losses made in the 2008-09 recession. Credit taps have been turned off and, unlike in the UK or the US, there has been no attempt at off-setting action by the European Central Bank. The ECB's balance sheet is shrinking not expanding. This lack of finance is making it hard for the recovery to get traction. The eurozone now looks a bit like the UK economy in 2011 and 2012, when activity was bumping along the bottom. In some quarters output picked up only to fall back again. Threadneedle Street responded in two ways; it expanded its quantitative easing programme, under which banks could exchange government gilts for cash. And it encouraged them to recycle that cash back into the economy through the Funding for Lending Scheme, which provided incentives for banks to lend to homebuyers and businesses. Something similar would not go amiss in the eurozone, although on past form the ECB will get there gradually. A cut in interest rates next month is now fully discounted in the financial markets. This, though, should be buttressed by incentives for banks to lend, particularly in the weaker economies. A full-blown QE programme is likely to be held in reserve at this stage, but is looking increasingly inevitable.",

The combined currency bloc scraped together growth of 0.2% between January and March, in line with growth in the previous quarter but disappointing expectations of 0.4% growth. The weak performance will heap further pressure on the European Central Bank to take action to boost the flagging region, after months of speculation. Peter Vanden Houte, economist at ING, described the official data as \"dismal\". There was a huge divergence in fortunes, with Germany growing at the fastest rate of all 18 countries, with gross domestic product increasing by 0.8%. It followed 0.4% growth in Europe's largest economy in the previous quarter. The pace of recovery also accelerated in Spain, with growth of 0.4% outpacing a 0.2% increase in GDP in the previous three months.

It followed 0.2% growth and 0.1% growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. Dutch statistics officials said the sharp fall in GDP was largely driven by lower household gas consumption due to the very mild winter. Evidence that the eurozone's sluggish recovery was losing momentum prompted further speculation that the ECB would be forced to imminently announce stimulative measures to breathe some life back into the region's economy. Vanden Houte said he expected a 0.1 percentage point cut in both eurozone interest rates and the rate of interest paid on bank deposits at the ECB's June policy meeting, amid a weaker growth outlook and the persistent threat of deflation in the region. He said: \"If anything, Thursday's dismal [GDP] figure should increase the pressure on the ECB to act next month. To keep growth on track and fight deflationary pressures, a renewed euro appreciation has to be avoided at all cost. \"We believe GDP growth is unlikely to be stronger in the second quarter than in the first quarter.

Carphone and Dixons said the merged company would benefit from greater buying power, extra growth options and annual savings of at least \u00a380m within three years. It also hopes to retail the combined broadband, pay TV and phone services offered by operators such as BT and Virgin, and to take commissions from supermarkets or music services for pre-installing their apps on smartphones. Using Carphone's Geek Squad tech support teams, Dixons Carphone aims to stand alongside road rescue groups the AA and RAC as \"an emergency service for the connected world\", according to Harrison. The promise is for an end-to-end service, from sales to set-up advice, service, insurance, repairs and recycling. Dixons and Carphone shareholders will each own 50% of the combined group under the deal, and Carphone concessions will be built into every Dixons outlet. In a leadership compromise, Carphone's chairman and founder, Sir Charles Dunstone, will lead a 14-strong board that also includes two deputy chairmen, a chief executive, a deputy chief executive and a senior non-executive director. Dixons' boss, Sebastian James, will be chief executive, while Andrew Harrison of Carphone Warehouse becomes his deputy. \"This is a genuine merger of equals founded on core strategic principles rather than straight cost cuts,\" said James, presenting the merger deal at London's Shard skyscraper on Thursday. \"We do things that are so adjacent that it makes sense to come together. Our markets are converging, and we are converging.\" The companies first announced their merger talks in February, although informal discussions about a possible tie-up began four years ago. Dunstone said: \"We see the merger of these two great companies as an opportunity to bring our skills together for the consumer and create a new retailer for the digital age.\" But both companies are grappling with structural changes as sales move online. Amazon has squeezed margins at Dixons, while the recent arrival AO.com, formerly Appliances Online, has just announced it will branch out from its white goods heartland into selling televisions as football fans install bigger screens in preparation for this summer's World Cup in Brazil. Electricals retailers are in danger of following book and record stores into high street oblivion. Comet was recently pushed into receivership, while Carphone's short-lived attempt to sell electricals with Best Buy ended in failure. Meanwhile, mobile networks would like to sell more through their own shops and so pay less commission to Carphone, and Apple does very well selling phones through its retail spaces. One independent analyst, Louise Cooper, at CooperCity was unimpressed with the deal: \"Two past-their-sell-by-date retailers merging does not an Amazon make.\" She also criticised the top-heavy leadership structure, saying: \"The board is beginning to look as unwieldy as that of Co-op. Executives are not leading from the front. Mostly they are retaining their jobs. That is the wrong message to the workforce.\" Investors appeared to agree, sending shares in both firms plummeting, with Dixons down nearly 10% to 46p a share, and Carphone down more than 7% to 303p. \"Concerns remain that the emphasis on equality in the merger may be masking indecision over who should take charge,\" said David Alexander at the retail researcher Columino. The companies said they would cut about 2% of their combined workforce to reduce costs but that they would add 4% to exploit growth opportunities, leading to a net 2% increase in staff. Under the terms of the merger, Dixons shareholders will receive 0.155 of a new Dixons Carphone share in exchange for each Dixons share. Dunstone's 23.5% share in Carphone will be halved to 11.75% in the new company. At Wednesday's closing prices, Carphone's market capitalisation was \u00a31.9bn and Dixons' was \u00a31.87bn. The combined company is likely to join the FTSE 100 index. Dixons released a trading statement predicting annual underlying pretax profit would be at the top end of market expectations, around \u00a3150m to \u00a3160m.
