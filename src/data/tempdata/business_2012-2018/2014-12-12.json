      "bodyText": "Italy\u2019s finance minister has warned that time is running out for Europe\u2019s tottering economies to avoid stagnation. Speaking on the eve of a national strike in Italy and after figures showed the country\u2019s industrial production fell yet again in October, he said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t much time. Europe is at a fork in the road. One path leads to stagnation; the other to growth that we sorely need.\u201d In a frank interview with the Guardian and other European news organisations, Pier Carlo Padoan attacked the European Investment Bank (EIB) for worrying more about its credit rating than about promoting growth and revealed he had been discussing with Brussels new rules to encourage government spending that underpinned structural reform. On Thursday in Italy there were violent clashes as millions of workers joined the nationwide stoppage in protest at the government\u2019s employment law reforms. Padoan\u2019s message for them was that there would be no U-turns. Earlier this month, parliament approved a bill giving Matteo Renzi\u2019s government a free hand to introduce by decree greater flexibility into the labour market. But until now it has been unclear whether Italy\u2019s left-right coalition, under pressure from the left wing of Renzi\u2019s Democratic party, would use its powers to the full. Padoan was unequivocal, saying: \u201cThe decrees are already prepared and they are such as to render extremely clear the direction: not to water down. No reform is going to be watered down.\u201d He gave a guarded welcome to the plan sponsored by European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to inject extra investment cash into the European economy from June. But Padoan warned that \u201cJune is a long way off for the time-scale of the economy\u201d, saying something had to be done in the meantime. One possibility was to mobilise the EIB. He added: \u201cThe problem with the EIB, as you know, is that it has a very prudent attitude to investment because, to protect its triple A [rating], it does not want to take on, let\u2019s call it, excessive risk. \u201cIn my opinion \u2013 and not just mine \u2013 the \u2018Bank of Europe\u2019, as they love to call themselves, could be a little bit more aggressive; a bit more proactive.\u201d Under the Juncker plan, which has been met with widespread scepticism, the commission and the EIB would provide guarantees of \u20ac21bn (\u00a316.7bn) to raise \u20ac65bn in loans for selected projects, in turn attracting private capital to bring the total to \u20ac315bn. But Padoan warned that not all investment projects were good. He said: \u201cI would like a European mechanism that takes on the task of evaluating European investment projects. It could be the EIB.\u201d The finance minister also argued for discrimination between different kinds of spending when assessing whether countries were complying with the government borrowing limits mandated in the eurozone. There were \u201citems of public expenditure that are probably not classified as investment, but are important\u201d, he said. Italy\u2019s 2015 budget offered an example: provision for welfare spending intended to ease the passage of the Renzi government\u2019s controversial labour market reform. While this was not investment this did contribute to long-term growth. \u201cI\u2019d be very glad if this qualitative aspect were explicitly recognised in the evaluation of countries\u2019 public finances,\u201d said Padoan. He said he had not yet raised the issue formally in a meeting of the economic and financial affairs council (Ecofin). But he had spoken about it with colleagues, and discussed it with Jyrki Katainen, the commission vice-president responsible for the economy. Next to Padoan\u2019s desk, in the vast office allocated to Italian finance ministers, there is a large crucifix and, below it, two trading screens. On one is displayed the indicator Italians know as lo spread, the yield gap between Italy\u2019s benchmark government bonds and Germany\u2019s. It is a measure of the market\u2019s confidence in Italy\u2019s ability to pay off its vast public debt of more than 130% of GDP, and Padoan confessed that he monitored it constantly. Until last week, the screen beside his desk displayed an encouragingly steep drop from left to right. By 5 December, it was below 1.2 percentage points. But since then it has gained almost a fifth of a point as storm clouds have again gathered over the eurozone. Markets remain spooked by the prospect of an early general election in Greece and a victory for the country\u2019s leftists, Syriza, whose leader Alexis Tsipras has mooted an orderly restructuring of his country\u2019s debts. While disclaiming any desire to interfere in the internal affairs of another country, Padoan \u2013 a former IMF official \u2013 had a warning for him. \u201cTo think that it is possible to have an orderly restructuring of [public] debt is very dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a big mistake to think that there is [any such thing as] a controlled, calm restructuring.\u201d \u2022 Alessandro Barbera (La Stampa), Ulrike Sauer (S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung), Philippe Ridet (Le Monde) and Pablo Ordaz (El Pa\u00eds) contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has joined the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve in preserving transcripts of its meetings for posterity. The decision to \u201caid transparency\u201d with verbatim records of monetary policy committee (MPC) debates follows the publication of the Kevin Warsh report into the Bank\u2019s efforts at communication. There was intense lobbying from central bank watchers for the British institution to fall in line with its bigger cousins, though they will only be half smiling at the outcome. The Bank has chosen to delay publication of transcripts for eight years rather than the five adopted by the Fed. It will also only publish the second of its two days of deliberations, excluding the more interesting first day when officials challenge each other, play devil\u2019s advocate and muse on the more esoteric risks that could knock the UK economy sideways. Bank governor Mark Carney was keen to stress that Warsh approved of the first day remaining behind a shroud. Warsh, a former Fed official, told a press conference that the Bank\u2019s deliberations are \u201csecond to none\u201d and would be jeopardised by full disclosure. Carney also brushed off concerns that the Bank remained outside the Freedom of Information Act and therefore beyond the reach of open public questioning. He said the publication delay was needed to go beyond the current five-year business cycle. But he emphasised that the main aim of the reforms was to improve the Bank\u2019s communications with the public and markets over the path of interest rates. This is where the MPC has faced severe criticism both from those who believe it doesn\u2019t disclose enough and analysts who would prefer it went back to its more obscurantist ramblings from which it was almost impossible to divine any meaning. The proposal to publish the minutes alongside the interest rate decision is supposed to give a more consistent message. The three-week wait between rate decisions and the minutes, during which speculation was rife over the Bank\u2019s direction of travel, will be no more from next August. Yet, most of what has confused the markets and borrowers with high debt interest bills has been the governor\u2019s speeches. These have made a huge impact on consumers and how relaxed they feel about opening their wallets and spending. A surge in recent months of unsecured credit borrowing appears to relate directly to the clearer message from the Bank that interest rates will remain at rock bottom well into next year and probably rise even more gradually than previously forecast. In the spring, a tougher message that rates would rise imminently choked spending. There are other factors at play, such as an equally recent rise in aggregate wage levels that Bank officials have spotted and believe is going to become a major factor in policymaking next year. Rising wages also trigger greater spending and borrowing. But still, what the Bank says matters because borrowing is what Brits do and the cost of credit is therefore important. These reforms may make a difference, but the governor\u2019s own view in his interviews and speeches will play an equally important role. And it is that message that should be consistent if he wants to eliminate shocks to consumer confidence and spending.",

They rightly perceive that there is a better chance that retailers can get it to them there.\u201d James Daunt, chief executive of the bookstore chain Waterstones, said its online deliveries were being delayed by \u201cone or two days\u201d as a result of problems at its courier service, Yodel, which has been overwhelmed with demand from the retailers it serves. He said online orders were up 30% year-on-year but twice as many books were being collected in stores compared with 2013. \u201cIt is becoming a significant proportion of sales,\u201d Daunt said. He added that the final weekend before Christmas was likely to see a peak in shoppers opting to pick up orders in stores. \u201cClick and collect is going to be massive. People will opt for that as they are guaranteed their item rather than relying on the likes of Yodel.\u201d Demand for click and collect is growing ahead of the online retail market, which was expected to increase by 22% this year with 930m parcels dispatched. Of those, 80m are expected to be collected from stores or other handy locations such as lockers or post offices, according to Starkey. Some 43% of UK consumers plan to use click and collect services this Christmas, according to research from retail analyst Verdict. It forecasts that the click and collect market will reach \u00a33.7bn this year, with \u00a31.6bn spent in the final quarter of the year alone. But click and collect is not immune from delays. Some deliveries to stores are also being affected as retailers struggle to cope with surging demand for online orders. M&amp;S has dropped next-day deliveries to stores and is only able to deliver within two days.",

      "bodyText": "The price of oil continued its precipitous fall on Friday,hitting five-and-a-half-year lows after the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted demand next year would be lower than expected. Benchmark Brent crude has dropped 47% since June and fell to just over $61 a barrel as the IEA warned of the threat of global social instability and the potential for financial defaults in big producer countries such as Venezuela and Russia. The oil price has plummeted in response to a massive buildup of shale-derived oil in the US, reduced fears of fighting in Iraq disrupting supplies, and slower growth in demand as the world economy falters. A decision by the Opec two weeks ago to keep its production at existing levels has been taken as a signal by traders and shippers that the producers\u2019 cartel is happy to see prices fall for the forseeable future. The IEA said in its December monthly oil report that it was cutting its 2015 demand growth forecast by 230,000 barrels a day to 900,000, partly because of falling output in former Soviet countries. It believed surging US oil supply would push total non-Opec output to a record increase, averaged over the year, of 1.9m barrels a day for 2014, but predicted \u201cthe pace is expected to slow to 1.3m barrels a day for next year.\u201d It also warned: \u201cThe resulting downward price pressure would raise the risk of social instability or financial difficulties if producers found it difficult to pay back debt.\u201d The Paris-based IEA singled out Russia and Venezuela as potential flashpoints for trouble and the warning came as the rouble, which has lost 40% in value against the dollar so far this year, hit a fresh record low.

But while the oil-producing countries face lost revenues and budget shortfalls, lower energy prices are expected to have a beneficial impact on the world economy.

But householders will welcome the falling gas price cutting heating bills, while motorists will be glad of lower costs at the pump. High home and transport costs are a big influence on inflation and affect the production and distribution of food and other items. Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s all announced they were reducing the price of their petrol by 2p a litre and knocking 1p a litre off diesel. The Tesco cut took effect from lunchtime on Friday , while the other three big supermarkets will introduce the lower prices from tomorrow. The average UK price of petrol has now dropped below \u00a31.20 a litre and is at its lowest level since December 2010, according to government figures. Airlines have said they expect air fares to fall next year if the lower prices continue, but have warned that there are unlikely to be immediate reductions because fuel is bought a long time in advance of use. There are strong signs in the US that lower energy prices are having a big effect on consumer spending with store and restaurant sales rising by 5% in November against the same month the previous year. One reason for lower prices is the weak state of the global economy, and no one can predict with accuracy whether oil prices will stay at the current levels or fall further. Tom Kloza, co-founder of the US-based Oil Price Information Service, has warned that the world could be heading for $45 per barrel oil, although he maintained that this kind of price was not sustainable longterm.",
