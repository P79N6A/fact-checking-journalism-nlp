    "webTitle": "Manufacturing slump sends sterling crashing to three-year low", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Confidence in the UK's ability to recover from the longest depression in 100 years appears to be waning after a slump in manufacturing sent the pound crashing to a level not seen since early 2010. Sterling was worth a little over $1.48 following official data that showed manufacturing dropped 1.5% in January on the previous month. According to the official figures, a sharp fall in the production of pharmaceuticals and building materials sent output tumbling 3% lower than the same month last year. A wider measure of industrial production was dragged lower by cuts in North Sea oil and gas investment. Analysts said the weak numbers from manufacturers and a raft of forecasts showing the economy slowing were consistent with the onset of a triple-dip recession. Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotiabank, said only a strong rise in the services sector could rescue the economy. \"This is the penultimate nail in the coffin in terms of triple-dip \u2013 it's pretty much game over now,\" said Clarke. \"Unless we have a stellar performance from the services sector, we're almost certainly in a triple dip.\" The National Institute for Economic and Social Research emphasised the weak state of the economy after it predicted GDP contracted in the last three months. Only a day after the OECD predicted the British economy was slowing, the researchers said national income contracted by 0.1% compared to 0.2% for the three months to the end of January. The dismal news will put pressure on the Bank of England to boost its quantitative easing scheme from its current \u00a3375bn level as it seeks to increase lending and growth. Threadneedle Street has reject pleas in recent months to increase the level of QE to \u00a3400bn despite a vote in favour from governor Sir Mervyn King at the February meeting of the monetary policy committee. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \"The data will pile more pressure on the Bank of England to inject more stimulus into the economy at its next policy meeting, and on the chancellor, to accept that more needs to be done to boost growth in next week's budget. \"With such a weak start to the year, the economy is facing an increased risk of falling into a triple-dip recession and the much-vaunted rebalancing remains elusive. In fact, recent data suggests the UK is moving in the opposite direction: away from goods production and is becoming ever-more dependent on consumer spending.\" George Osborne will also face tough questions in the budget debate next week. The chancellor, who has come under fire from his own backbenchers for a lack of action, is expected to put forward a range of policies to boost growth. However, he faces a difficult task in tackling the lack of lending by major banks following a report by the main City regulator that the mortgage market remains weak and first-time buyers are still struggling to get on the housing ladder. The FSA report followed a string of figures showing bank lending contracting, especially lending to small businesses, despite schemes to increase the supply of funds. Osborne is also expected to be concerned that City traders expect inflation to accelerate over the coming months, hitting consumer spending power. The prospect of rising prices as measured by the difference in inflation-linked five and 10-year bond yields nudged up to near 3.3%, a level not seen since 2008. The manufacturing employers' group EEF warned many firms were holding back production and investment while customers at home and abroad remained \"jittery\". A recovery in the US and a lower pound have so far failed to lift the fortunes of exporters, which remain hamstrung by recession in the eurozone. Trade data revealed that businesses continue to rely for 50% of their exports on customers in the troubled eurozone. Exports fell 2.5% in January, dragged own by a 3.5% drop in goods exports. Critics of the government's economic policies blamed the fall on a slump in demand that followed the UK and continental Europe's pursuit of austerity before growth had regained momentum. Labour said the government had failed to demonstrate that Plan A was working. The party's Treasury spokesman, Ed Balls, has repeatedly accused the government of prolonging the downturn and failing to re-balance the economy towards manufacturing and exports. However, Williamson at Markit said growth in services could still be enough to prevent a third recession, and pointed to a recovery in the US and more broadly in Asia as a reason for optimism over the coming months. \"Growth has strengthened in the US, Japan has pulled out of its recession and even the eurozone is showing signs of stabilising, led by robust-looking expansion in Germany. Emerging markets, notably key sources of rising demand for UK-produced goods such as China, Brazil and India, have also seen improved economic performance compared to late last year,\" he said.",

The proposed selloff came at the end of a day in which its rival bailed-out bank Lloyds Banking Group raised \u00a3400m from selling off part of its stake in the wealth manager St James's Place and British Land built up a \u00a31bn war chest through a \u00a3500m share placing and the sale of its 20-storey Ropemaker Place building in the City of London. RBS must dispose of the whole of Direct Line by 2014 under the conditions imposed by Brussels when the bank was bailed out with \u00a345bn of taxpayers' money. One third was floated on the stock market in October and the insurer is now selling off the equivalent of a 15% stake in the insurer which could raise as much as \u00a3500m. The City had been expecting RBS to sell off its stake in three equal portions until 2014 and it sold off the extra shares just as its close rival Esure, owner of brands such as Sheila's Wheels, prepares a \u00a31.3bn flotation. The decision by RBS to accelerate the disposal took place when the FTSE 100 index hit a fresh five-year high of 6510 \u2013 its highest level since 2007. Even so, shares in British Land fell 4.5% after it announced its fundraising, which it intends to use to pay for recent purchases and other deals it has in negotiation.",

      "bodyText": "Small business groups have accused John Lewis of greed and a betrayal of its own partnership ethos after it was revealed the company has demanded rebates of up to 5.25% from the majority of its 3,000 suppliers despite announcing record profits. In a letter seen by the Guardian, a head buyer for John Lewis wrote to one supplier stating that a rebate would be automatically applied to their costs. The buyer added: \"So far we have rolled out growth rebates to many of our suppliers and they have been participating by sharing the benefits of their success with John Lewis.\" The rules state that if a supplier has seen a year-on-year growth on their products sold at John Lewis they pay a rebate which increases depending on the size of growth. Between 5% to 9.9% growth requires a 0.75% rebate, through to sales growth of 50% and above which incurs a 5.25% rebate. Retail and business organisations called on the company to scrap the system and questioned the business's ethical practices. Michael Weedon, deputy chief executive for the British Independent Retailers Association, said: \"John Lewis are supposed to be retail's white-hat good guys, but just days after the partners share a bonus worth nine weeks' pay they announce an additional tax on their suppliers. Partnership doesn't seem to include their supply partners.\" The revelation follows last week's record results, which saw a 9.1% boost in sales to \u00a38.47bn, with profits up 15.8% to \u00a3410m, leading to a 17% bonus payout to all employees. On the company's web portal for suppliers to submit invoices it says: \"As a valued supplier to the partnership, you will know that our brand values are built upon establishing deep, sustainable relationships with our customers and suppliers and that is how we will continue to operate.\" A spokesman for the Forum of Private Business branded the company \"greedy\". He added: \"John Lewis has worked hard to build an image as the ethical face of the UK high street, it would be a shame for them to undo all that by succumbing to greed. \"They'd earn far more respect from the public if they rescinded this decision now, which would give heart to the many thousands of suppliers \u2013 not just those for John Lewis \u2013 that big business in the UK is prepared to listen and act when it gets something so badly wrong.\" It also comes on the day John Lewis chairman, Charlie Mayfield, had an essay published where he encouraged more businesses to be run as co-operatives. He said: \"If we want a long-term approach and a fairer sharing of rewards, then a good place to start is to encourage [different] forms of ownership \u2026 That's not the case at the moment.\" The company is the latest retailer to squeeze suppliers by demanding a rebate. Debenhams recently wrote to its suppliers saying there was an \"expectation\" that they would get a cost reduction of at least 2% retrospectively applied to all orders due for delivery from 4 March. It said: \"There is an increased focus within the business to optimise margins, given the strong trading performance in Home and resulting increase in business for suppliers.\" Monsoon Accessorize also wrote to suppliers last month calling for a rebate of up to 4%. A spokeswoman for John Lewis said: \"This proposal is in relation to performance for 2013/14, therefore there is nothing due until 2014, giving our suppliers time to plan and budget accordingly. This is part of our ongoing terms and conditions and as ever, our suppliers have the right to discuss these with us at any time.\"",

But the reality, perhaps, is that a single lending initiative was always unlikely to overcome the more powerful force of a fundamentally weak economy.

Yes, there will always be cases of creditworthy small businesses that are unfairly denied credit. But the wider story seems clear: the FLS feels like a flop because the economy is a flop. Splitting the scheme into two to divide mortgage lending (where they are signs of improvement) from small business lending (where there are not) seems a reasonable tweak. That would allow a bank that is shrinking its mortgage book to expand more easily its business lending. But it would still only be a tweak.",

Splitting the scheme into two to divide mortgage lending (where they are signs of improvement) from small business lending (where there are not) seems a reasonable tweak. That would allow a bank that is shrinking its mortgage book to expand more easily its business lending. But it would still only be a tweak.</p>",

George Osborne, in his guise as an economic plumber, has preferred to keep his head under the sink in search of a serious blockage, despite a welter of opinion that points to a lack of water entering the system. So, Tuesday's fall in industrial production is, in part, the result of a pound that is too high and a workforce that lacks the right skills. Just as the lack of house building is the result of outdated planning laws and lending to small businesses is low because the banks have failed to develop low interest products to entice customers. Push the pound lower, supercharge the Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme to reduce interest rates and rip up the planning laws. Yet there is no blockage. The supply-side obsession of various monetarists is based on a myth. When the recovery comes, all these issues are pushed to one side. That's not to say they are unimportant. But they are not standing in the way and should be addressed in better times. There are leaks from the system that are undermining progress. Money started leaving the financial system immediately following the crash when businesses, banks and households began frantically paying down their debts. Not that leaks can be tackled now. That also comes later. Crucially, there is a lack of pressure after Osborne turned off the spending taps. No water in, no water out. Osborne would say he played his part when the Treasury sanctioned huge spending by the Bank of England via quantitative easing. But QE has proved weak and inadequate to the task. QE follows a long and winding route into the real economy and loses much of its strength on the way. That's not an argument for scrapping it. Just a reason to turn on the stopcock that takes government cash from its source in the Treasury. Does that mean doubling tax credit payments or jobseeker's allowance as Iain Duncan Smith scaremongers? No, there are hundreds of things we need to spend money on that will give the nation an economic return, from NHS spending that keeps workers in good health to infrastructure projects that allow businesses to be more efficient. Borrowing will rocket? Not really. It will rise gently at first, but will be paid back in spades by higher tax income. Soon the private sector, reassured that there is a safer and more profitable environment for investment, will take over the heavy lifting. The public sector is not the enemy of private enterprise.

      "bodyText": "Back to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith says the country\u2019s finance minister has confirmed that that long-awaited meeting between prime minister Antonis Samaras and vistiing Troika mission chiefs has been postponed until tomorrow. She writes: Emerging from the prime minister\u2019s office, the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras said the crucial talks had been delayed so that once they did happen they could be \u201cmore effective.\u201d \u201cBecause discussions with the technical teams are continuing we considered it useful that we allow for another day so that a meeting could be more effective,\u201d he told reporters. But highlighting the difficulties that lie ahead, the macro-economist conceded that \u201cmany issues that still remain open\u201d \u2013 code-language for unresolved. When asked if those issues could be settled by tomorrow even, Stournaras hedged his bets saying it was \u201cquite\u201d possible. Samaras\u2019 coalition government, acutely aware of the growing levels of popular anger at EU and IMF-mandated austerity, is engaged in a tight-rope act trying to placate lenders while at the same time ensure social peace. And with that it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. The go-to man for debt restructurings says Greece may need to kick the can even further down the road, and sees Spain as a greater threat to the eurozone than Italy. Lee Buchheit of Cleary Gottlieb, who was present at all the major debt crises of the past three decades, spoke to my colleague Josephine Moulds about the ongoing crisis in the currency bloc. She writes: \"In Greece, [Buchheit] says, there is more to do. Yes, it has slashed its debts but much of it has simply been transferred into loans from public institutions. \u201cTo be made presentable again to the markets, you are going to have to do something with that debt stock, otherwise it hangs like a miasmic cloud over their future.\u201d Another \u201chaircut\u201d is not politically feasible. \u201cNo northern European politician is going to gleefully sign on to the proposition that they lost a euro. But they can say, \u2018Let us stretch this out so that it matures on the 12th of never.\u2019\u201d So Germany and the other eurozone countries might lend to Greece at a rate of 2%, and agree not to be repaid for another 40 years. \u201cNow,\u201d says Buchheit, energised as he gets into the finer details, \u201cthe purist would say you\u2019ve kicked the can a long way down the road to be sure, but it\u2019s still a can and it\u2019s still pretty battered and you haven\u2019t changed the debt to GDP [ratio] or any of that.\u201d But, he explains, investors will not worry about that if they can lend to Greece over, say, 39 years, as they will get their money back before the public sector lenders. The more pressing question, however, is Cyprus. European leaders meet on Thursday to discuss the terms of its bailout. Meanwhile, its debt investors will be nervous to hear it was on Buchheit\u2019s itinerary when he visited Europe in January. Despite having an economy worth 0.2% of eurozone GDP, what happens in Cyprus will be crucial to the next stage of the crisis, says Buchheit. \u201cIn one sense, the fact that Cyprus is small arguably allows them to experiment. But the world will watch it and see Spain.\u201d Spain, he says, may be a more immediate risk than Italy, with its mountains of regional, as well as national, debt. But fixing its problems will be anything but simple. Read the full story here. It's been another mixed day - albeit a fairly uneventful one - for European shares. The UK market moved higher despite poor UK manufacturing figures and renewed talk of triple dip recession, but most other exchanges recorded minor losses. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished at 6510.62, up 6.99 points or 0.11% \u2022 France's CAC climbed 0.1% \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.23% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB closed down 0.42% \u2022 Spain's Ibex was 0.26% lower \u2022 The Athens market added 1.23% And after its record breaking run, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 0.06% in early trading. Bill Gross at Pimco has some advice for Mario Draghi and the European Central Bank. Prompting this: Meanwhile Cyprus and the troika are negotiating a smaller bailout package, Dow Jones is reporting: Earlier of course German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was saying the Bundestag could vote on a bailout package for Cyprus next week. If the deal gets done this week, that timetable looks plausible. Still with Greece, the meeting between prime minister Antonis Samaras and visiting troika officials, due to take place this evening has now apparently been postponed until tomorrow... Greek banks turned to cheaper ECB funding in January, new figures have shown. ECB funding to the country's banks rose from \u20ac19.35bn in December to \u20ac76.22, while emergency liquidity assistance from Greece's central bank fell from \u20ac101.85bn to \u20ac31.42bn. Tapping European Central Bank funds is around 2 percentage points cheaper than the ELA. Germany's second largest bank, Commerzbank, is preparing a capital increase of between \u20ac700m and \u20ac800m, according to a report in Manager Magazin. Germany could vote on an aid package for Cyprus as early as next week. That is what finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has told conservative politicians, although that is dependent on a decision from eurozone finance ministers that the country require financial assistance. The Bundestag lower house of parliament would be deciding on a \u20ac17bn aid package for Cyprus, mainly to help recapitalise its banks. And with that I'll hand the blog over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Respected forecaster NIESR estimates that the UK economy declined by 0.1% in February. That would point towards a 0.1% decline in GDP over the three months to February. But the thinktank would not be drawn on whether the economy will shrink over the three months to March and therefore slide into a triple-dip recession. Simon Kirby of NIESR said: It's going to be a very close run thing. The obsession with triple-dip distracts us from the more important point that the UK has been effectively flat for over two years. The real risk for the economy is an absence of growth throughout 2013. It's the risk that this trend of stagnation will continue through 2013. He said the trade figures today may have looked positive but, in fact, demonstrated the weakness of imports, which highlighted the lack of domestic demand. NIESR defines a period of depression as one in which the economy languishes below its pre-recession peak, which they pinpoint as January 2008. The UK economy is still 3.25% below that level and NIESR says this period of depression is likely to continue until 2015. But he notes the disputes over the term 'depression'. Quite often people think about a depression in terms of a very, very, very severe recession, like the experience of Germany in 1930s. That is quite clearly not the case for the UK at the moment. Over in Greece, our correspondent Helena Smith says officials are putting on a brave face ahead of prime minister Antonis Samaras' crunch meeting with visiting troika mission chiefs. She writes: Ahead of the talks, which begin at 6pm local time, Greece\u2019s technocrat finance minister Yannis Stournaras today held back-to-back meetings with technical teams representing foreign lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF. As the debt-stricken country\u2019s next \u20ac2.8bn installment of aid depends on the outcome of tonight\u2019s discussions, the rush to reach consensus on a series of outstanding issues has assumed what one official described as \u201cdramatic proportions.\u201d Although the climate between Greece and its creditors has much improved since the conservative-led coalition assumed power last June, more divides the two than unites them, say analysts who agree that a breakdown would be a severe blow. Far away from the optimism expressed by Stournaras in his interview with the Guardian, few observers in Athens believe the eurozone\u2019s weakest link has overcome the crisis. Most see the autumn as a make-or-break time following general elections at the end of September in Germany. Taxes, debts and public sector lay-offs have topped the list of disagreements with visiting troika inspectors. Creditors are pushing for the highly controversial property tax, levied through electricity bills, to be extended through 2013. At a time when liquidity has all but dried up and Greece is undergoing a form of internal default, with no one paying anyone else, the prospect of the measure being prolonged has been met with protests and derision. Auditors are also demanding faster implementation of civil servant staff reductions \u2013 a demand that has elicited fierce opposition from Samaras\u2019 two junior leftwing partners at a time when unemployment is nudging towards a European high of 27%. What compromises are made \u2013 and more importantly how they are made \u2013 will determine tonight\u2019s result. A banking union is \"vital\" for better financial integration of the eurozone, ECB board member Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9 said today. A highly integrated financial system is necessary to ensure that the impulses coming from our monetary policy diffuse homogeneously through financial markets across the euro area as a whole. He said a \"strong and independent supranatural supervisor\" for the banking sector would help the monetary union function more smoothly and aid the restoration of confidence in the banking sector. Regaining such confidence, in turn, is also key to reversing financial fragmentation and restarting fully functioning cross-border markets. You can read the full speech here. The incoming governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has met the UK treasury's top civil servant to discuss changes to the central bank's remit, according to Bloomberg. Carney and Nicholas Macpherson are reported to have discussed the options in Ottawa ahead of the budget next week, when it is thought chancellor George Osborne may announce changes to the Bank of England's role. (Cynics might suggest this would be an interesting diversionary tactic.) Theophilos Argitis of Bloomberg reports: Carney has signaled support for allowing the bank more flexibility in meeting its 2% inflation goal and promoted the idea of issuing guidance on longer-term policy. In a speech in December, Carney put forward the idea of targeting nominal GDP rather than inflation. He then said in a treasury select committee. The benefits of any regime change would have to be weighed carefully, not only against the potential risks but also against the effectiveness of other unconventional monetary measures under the proven, flexible inflation-targeting framework. This was particularly notable as Carney was the first to suggest the inflation-targeting framework was \"flexible\". Despite the focus on today's manufacturing data out of the UK, it is worth pointing out just how bad the industrial production figures were, falling to their lowest level since May 1992, a near 21-year low. With all the talk of the UK dropping into an economic depression in the comments below, it may be worth looking at how significant a threat this is. First off, Investopedia defines an economic depression as follows: A depression is a sustained and severe recession. Where a recession is a normal part of the business cycle, lasting for a period of months, a depression is an extreme fall in economic activity lasting for a number of years. Shaun Richards, an independent economist who writes the blog Mindful Money, says the UK is in danger of falling into a depression and blames it on \"a clear policy error in the UK to emphasis monetary policy as a response to the credit crunch\". The \u201cquick fix\u201d has not worked and indeed it cannot now be quick and it plainly is not working either. Splashing money into the system and devaluing the currency are not working and yet we get more of it. He cites the possible expansion of quantitative easing, plans to put Funding for Lending on steroids, and the decline of the pound. Instead, he says, the government should be concentrating on reforming the banks. The claws are out. The EU's top economic official Olli Rehn has hit back at critics of austerity and called US economist Paul Krugman a liar in the process. The fight between the two bubbled up last month when the European Commission published forecasts showing the recession in southern European countries applying tough austerity policies would be deeper and last longer than previously projected. At the time, Krugman accused the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs of a \"Rehn of Terror\" for arguing that EU countries' austerity policies had restored market confidence. Rehn responded in an interview in a Finnish newspaper this morning, using a parliamentary euphemism for a lie: Krugman put words in my mouth that would be termed in the Finnish Parliament a modified truth. Reuters reports that Rehn said Krugman and other critics had distorted the findings of an International Monetary Fund study published last year on so-called \"fiscal multipliers\" and the consequences of austerity policies to attack European policies. In the paper, IMF economists acknowledged they may have underestimated the impact of government spending cuts in dampening growth. Rehn said: It is essential that the IMF paper does not give rise to the conclusion that economic adjustment would not be desirable. He added that Brussels and the IMF agree on the importance of structural economic reforms to boost growth. Responding to those who argued for a slower pace of fiscal consolidation to ease the pain on citizens, Rehn said that might have been possible if unlimited cheap funding had been available from either the private sector or other euro zone countries. What I don't understand is where on earth the stimulus money could have come from,\" he said, adding: \"I sincerely hope that people who are cleverer than me will suggest alternative ways of getting credit flowing into Europe. So far, distinguished economic experts had not suggested any financially or politically realistic alternatives, Rehn was quoted as saying. Here's our economics correspondent Philip Inman on the UK data. The UK's third recession since the financial crash is almost certain after a dive in manufacturing in January. According to official data, a sharp fall in the production of pharmaceuticals and building materials pushed manufacturing 1.5% lower than December and 3% lower than the same month last year. A wider measure of industrial production fell 1.2% compared with a poll of economists for Reuters that showed they expected a 0.1% rise. Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank said only a strong rise in the services sector could rescue the economy from a triple dip recession. \"It is looking unlikely,\" he said. Critics of the government's economic policies blamed the fall on a slump in demand that followed the UK and continental Europe's pursuit of austerity before growth has regained momentum. Manufacturing employers group EEF warned that many firms were holding back production and investment while customers at home and abroad remained \"jittery\". The figures are likely to increase pressure on the Bank of England to inject further funds into the economy. Last month the central bank's monetary policy committee balked at boosting the total spent as part of its quantitative easing policy from \u00a3375bn. Full story here. While Italian borrowing costs are rising (see 10.12am), Spain's have dropped to their lowest level since April 2010 \u2013 just before the international rescue was announced for Greece. The Spanish treasury sold \u20ac5.8bn of six and 12-month treasury bills, beating the target amount of \u20ac5.5bn. The one-year debt came in at an average yield of 1.363% \u2013 compared with 1.548% in February. Six month-debt came in at an average yield of 0.794%, compared with 0.859% a month earlier. Jose Luis Martinez at Citi said: It was a very positive auction, with strong underlying demand... with lower yields. What more can you ask for? This is interesting. Markit shows how the increase in the UK's trade of services has been more than offset by the decline in the UK's trade of goods since the year 2000, with little sign of a change in the trend any time soon. There's a growing chorus of economists calling for more stimulus from the Bank of England and the government, following the poor UK data. Here's Chris Williamson of Markit: The data will pile more pressure on the Bank of England, to inject more stimulus into the economy at its next policy meeting, and on the chancellor, to accept that more needs to be done to boost growth in next week's budget. With such a weak start to the year, the economy is facing an increased risk of falling into a triple-dip recession and the much-vaunted rebalancing remains elusive. In fact, recent data suggest the UK is moving in the opposite direction: away from goods production and is becoming ever-more dependent on consumer spending. Britain needs a national export strategy says the British Chambers of Commerce, following poor manufacturing data. David Kern chief economist BCC said: More effective action is needed to ensure that the considerable untapped potential of many British exporters can be used to drive a sustainable recovery. The government must implement the measures it has already announced to support companies seeking to break into new markets. We clearly need a national export strategy that focuses on key areas such as trade finance, promotion, and insurance, and would enable British companies to compete in the global arena. Meanwhile, the head of Germany's central bank says the risk of inflation in the eurozone is declining. Germany is seen as the main impediment to the European Central Bank cutting rates because of its fear of inflation. But Jens Weidmann, who is a member of the ECB's governing council, said in a statement this morning there was no reason to stir up concerns about inflation. In the short term, we in the euro area have, if anything, declining inflation risks. He said Germany's economy is still shaken by the eurozone crisis, which poses the biggest risk to the outlook for the country's economy. Only some of the confidence lost as a result of crisis has been recovered so far. But he expects Germany's growth to strengthen as the year progresses. Here's the Reuters report on the UK data: British manufacturing output fell in January at the fastest pace since June, wiping out the previous month's gains and reinforcing fears that the economy made a weak start to the year. Manufacturing output dropped 1.5% on the month, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday, noting that snowy weather at the end of January had had little impact. The wider reading of industrial output, which includes energy production and mining, fell 1.2% after a 1.1% rise in December, partly due to a shutdown of a North Sea oil field that typically accounts for 3%-6% of Britain's oil production. Economists had predicted broadly steady readings for both manufacturing and industrial production. The latest figures will worry finance minister George Osborne as he prepares to deliver his annual budget to parliament next week. The sluggish trend may persist. A survey of purchasing managers revealed earlier an unexpected contraction in the manufacturing sector in February, raising the risk that Britain is entering its third recession since the 2008 financial crisis. However, separate ONS data released at the same time showed a rare improvement in Britain's trade position. The goods trade deficit shrank to \u00a38.195bn in January from \u00a38.738bn in December, versus forecasts for a modest deterioration to \u00a39bn. Here's a graph of the plunge in sterling on the UK data, courtesy of CMC Market's Michael Hewson. The change in the UK's inflation basket (see 9.46am) prompts the inevitable horsemeat jokes... Over to Italy, where there is more bad news. Hit by the political instability in the country, its borrowing costs have risen in the latest auction of one-year debt. Italy paid a yield \u2013 effectively the interest rate \u2013 of 1.28% in an auction of \u20ac7.75bn of one-year debt, the highest rate since December. But it could be a lot worse. After an initial shock, the markets recovered and appear relatively sanguine about the current political impasse. Here's a chart from the ONS that shows the slide in industrial production and manufacturing, despite the odd bounce. Here's Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight on the \"worrying\" set of UK data. The manufacturing figures are awful even if it is possible that the snow had more of a negative impact than the Office for National Statistics indicate and are a real blow to first quarter growth prospects. A rebound in manufacturing output in December and some reasonable survey evidence for January had lifted hopes that the manufacturing sector could be emerging from a torrid time but the January output figures and a poor purchasing managers\u2019 survey for February indicate that manufacturers are still finding life very tough. On the face of it, the sharply reduced trade deficit in January is better news for hopes that the economy can grow in the first quarter. But even here the headline figure masks some worrying trends as the reduced deficit occurred because UK imports fell more than exports. This indicates that UK exporters are currently still finding life very tough while domestic demand is weak All in all, a pretty worrying set of data for both the Bank of England and the Chancellor to contemplate. David Tinsley at BNP Paribas, meanwhile, says the UK is headed for its third recession in four years. They are extremely disappointing manufacturing production numbers. Perhaps the story is not the weather behind the overall picture and it's not just down to oil output that has led to distortions in the data over the last six months or so. Basically it's a very bad start to January and therefore the first quarter. Unless the service sector delivers solid growth, we are likely to see a contraction in the first quarter. Here's Philip Shaw of Investec on the \"appalling\" manufacturing data, which he says piles pressure on George Osborne to announce some kind of stimulus in next week's budget. The manufacturing figures are appalling. They represent a very poor start to 2013 for the factory sector. This may be a snow story once again, but one should be wary about putting too much of the blame onto weather conditions. Our view is that the UK will probably avoid a triple-dip recession but these figures hardly inspire confidence in that view. The softness of the numbers, irrespective of special events really puts the pressure on the chancellor to deliver some sort of stimulus to the economy. Clearly on the fiscal side, there is no room to relax policy, either by cutting taxes or raising spending. What he seems likely to do would be to give the monetary policy committee more licence to be aggressive on policy as suggested by newspaper headlines last week. And there remains the question of trying to channel credit to SMEs. To recap, UK manufacturing output fell in January at its fastest pace since 2009 (ignoring the Jubilee weekend last year), wiping out December's gains. Separately, the ONS said Britain's trade position showed a rare improvement in January, driven by a drop in oil imports. Some instant reaction to the data, courtesy of Reuters: James Knightley economist at ING: With the February PMI manufacturing index coming in so weak and with orders numbers also disappointing it looks as though this sector is going to be a major drag on growth in the first quarter of 2013. We have already has poor construction numbers for the start of the quarter so the prospect of yet another return to technical recession is very real. This will intensify the pressure on the Bank of England to do more to help support the economy, given government officials suggest they have no intention of letting up on austerity. Admittedly the trade balance has improved, but this is more to do with weakness in imports than a pick-up in exports. As such it underlines the weak domestic demand story in the UK. The UK stock market rose on the poor data, which commentators put down to hopes that the Bank of England will pump more money into the economy to revive the economy, via its quantitative easing programme. On a lighter note, the Office for National Statistics has updated the basket of goods it uses to calculate inflation. In come... ebooks, set-top boxes, white rum, hot chocolate, deli type meats and blueberries, and packets of daily disposable contact lenses Out go... on-sale champagne and (inexplicably) basin taps. Steve Collins of London &amp; Capital Asset Management notes that the last time UK manufacturing was this bad was a result of the many bank holidays over the Jubilee weekend. Ignoring that, this is the worst showing from the sector since the dark days of 2009. The pound dropped to a new two-and-a-half year low on the miserable UK data, down by half a cent against dollar to $1.4854 (and still falling). Taking a closer look at the figures, the 1.5% month-on-month decline in manufacturing output is the steepest drop since June last year. Industrial output also missed forecasts of a 0.1% increase, to drop 1.2% in January. UK manufacturing figures are in and they look bad. Economists were expecting factory output to be flat in January, but instead it dropped 1.5%, according to the Office for National Statistics. January was blighted by snow, but these figures will all be fed into the GDP calculator and suggest the UK could be headed for its third recession in four years. Just to recap, the UK economy shrank by 0.3% in the last quarter of 2012. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, so a decline this month would push the UK into a dreaded triple-dip. The news will come as a blow to the chancellor, George Osborne, who is due to present his budget next week. We'll have analyst reaction on those figures as it comes in. The Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras says Greece is close to overcoming its financial crisis and can look forward with optimism, in the Guardian this morning. Speaking to our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, Stournaras said: To a large extent, Greece is out of the woods. No one talks about Grexit now \u2013 even economists who advocated Grexit have apologised for it. As far as fiscal adjustment is concerned, we have covered two thirds of the goal. As far as competitiveness is concerned, we have covered three quarters of the distance to the goal. Greece has paid a very high price in terms of austerity \u2026 But I think the worse is behind us and we can look at the future with hope. Prompting some derision on Twitter... Denmark's triple-A rating was confirmed this morning by ratings agency Fitch, with a stable outlook. Fitch said Denmark merited the top-notch rating because of its... Track record of macro-financial stability reflected in low and stable inflation, current account surpluses and the stable banking sector despite a high level of household indebtedness and weakening housing market. Eurozone outsider, Denmark is one of the few European countries to retain its triple-A rating. But the country of bicycles crime dramas has not been completely impervious to the crisis. The Danish economy shrank more than expected at the end of last year, putting government forecasts for growth in doubt. A burst property bubble hit confidence and private consumption and put the banking sector under pressure. Sluggish exports also hampered economic recovery, as demand in the eurozone stayed weak. Fitch remained unworried, saying this morning: Concerns for the banking sector arising from the bursting of the housing bubble in 2008 and the global financial crisis in 2009 have eased, and large Danish banks in particular have improved balance sheets and capitalisation. Though it notes the country's sensitivity to the eurozone crisis, as a potential risk. As a small open economy with extensive trade and financial linkages to the rest of the world and eurozone, a material worsening of the global economic outlook and/or intensification of the eurozone crisis would affect Denmark's economic recovery and potentially place pressure on public finances and the financial sector. Inflation in Germany slowed to its lowest level in more than two years in February, according to official data. The statistics office confirmed previous estimates that the cost of living in Germany increased by just 1.5% on a 12-month basis this month, down from 1.7% in January. That could help pave the way for an ECB rate cut. IMF chief Christine Lagarde said last week that the ECB should cut rates and noted that restoring the balance in the EU might mean allowing somewhat higher inflation and wage growth in countries like Germany. In France, embattled president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is attempting to reverse a vertiginous decline in his popularity with a road trip around the country. Our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis reports: Fran\u00e7ois Hollande tried today to reverse his record unpopularity by embarking on old-fashioned, lingering trips to the provinces in the style of Charles de Gaulle, whose made-to-measure bed he will pointedly be sleeping in on his first trip in Dijon. Several polls have shown Hollande's approval ratings to be the lowest of any modern French leader 10 months into a presidency. French military intervention in Mali, which the Socialists hoped would improve his presidential stature and neutralise the right's charges of dithering, produced only a slight, short-lived bounce. The latest TNS-Sofres poll found only 30% of French people had confidence in him to solve France's problems. An Ifop poll for Paris Match found only 37% of the French approved of his politics. Hollande's unpopularity is linked to the growing economic crisis and rising unemployment. No French leader has ever managed to climb in the popularity stakes while joblessness was rising fast. French unemployment is at a 14-year high and has steadily grown for almost two years. It threatens soon to reach the 1997 record of 3.2 million without work. We've got industrial and manufacturing data out of the UK today. And respected thinktank NIESR will make its estimate of UK GDP in February, which will be closely watched for indications that the economy is sliding into a triple-dip recession. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets notes: With the pound continuing to sink on the currency markets and investors continuing to focus more on the UK\u2019s fragile fundamentals every piece of economic data is being subject to greater and greater scrutiny ahead of next week\u2019s budget, as the pressure continues to build on the Chancellor to come up with some creative measures to help boost the UK\u2019s struggling economy. Germany inflation (February): 7am France current account (January): 7.45am UK industrial and manufacturing data (January): 9.30am UK trade balance (January): 9.30am Germany Bundesbank's annual report for 2012: 10am UK GDP estimate from NIESR (February): 3pm In the debt markets, Spain and Italy are selling short-term debt, and Germany is selling \u20ac1bn of a bond due in 2023. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other global economic events. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras will meet the troika mission chiefs in Athens this afternoon in an attempt to agree on key reforms. The result of the meeting will decide whether Greece's international lenders release the next installment of the country's \u20ac173bn bailout. The meeting comes at the end of a marathon visit from the troika, which has been extended after officials got bogged down in a spat over public-sector layoffs. Greece has promised to cut the civil service by 150,000 workers by the end of 2015. So far, it is on track to meet that target through attrition but the government has yet to actually sack anyone. We'll have updates on that meeting later today and other economic events from around the world.",

She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"In Greece, [Buchheit] says, there is more to do. Yes, it has slashed its debts but much of it has simply been transferred into loans from public institutions. \u201cTo be made presentable again to the markets, you are going to have to do something with that debt stock, otherwise it hangs like a miasmic cloud over their future.\u201d</p> <p>Another \u201chaircut\u201d is not politically feasible. \u201cNo northern European politician is going to gleefully sign on to the proposition that they lost a euro. But they can say, \u2018Let us stretch this out so that it matures on the 12th of never.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So Germany and the other eurozone countries might lend to Greece at a rate of 2%, and agree not to be repaid for another 40 years. \u201cNow,\u201d says Buchheit, energised as he gets into the finer details, \u201cthe purist would say you\u2019ve kicked the can a long way down the road to be sure, but it\u2019s still a can and it\u2019s still pretty battered and you haven\u2019t changed the debt to GDP [ratio] or any of that.\u201d</p> <p>But, he explains, investors will not worry about that if they can lend to Greece over, say, 39 years, as they will get their money back before the public sector lenders.</p> <p>The more pressing question, however, is Cyprus. European leaders meet on Thursday to discuss the terms of its bailout. Meanwhile, its debt investors will be nervous to hear it was on Buchheit\u2019s itinerary when he visited Europe in January. Despite having an economy worth 0.2% of eurozone GDP, what happens in Cyprus will be crucial to the next stage of the crisis, says Buchheit. \u201cIn one sense, the fact that Cyprus is small arguably allows them to experiment. But the world will watch it and see Spain.\u201d</p> <p>Spain, he says, may be a more immediate risk than Italy, with its mountains of regional, as well as national, debt. But fixing its problems will be anything but simple.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full story <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/12/lee-buchheit-finance-distress\">here.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-513f634195cb3037f5c824ca\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-12T17:17:53.390Z\">5.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets mostly edge lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's been another mixed day - albeit a fairly uneventful one - for European shares.

      "bodyText": "British Land has unveiled plans to build up a near \u00a31bn warchest to take advantage of a growing number of retail and office properties coming onto the market. The group has sold its 20-storey Ropemaker Place development in the City of London for \u00a3472m \u2013 around 1.4% above its value in the books \u2013 and is raising another \u00a3500m from shareholders by placing 89m shares, which represents 9.9% of the company. Analysts said the placing price was likely to be around 558p a share, and in the market British Land has fallen 17.5p to 563p following the news. It said: \"In recent months [we have] seen a clear acceleration in the flow of opportunities ... Many of these are being driven by structural changes, as institutions reconfigure their property holdings and smaller companies look to exit the UK market. \"In addition the company believes that vendors are showing an increasing realism around values, with access to financing continuing to constrain many buyers. These factors have been important features behind many of the company's recent acquisitions, such as the Clarges Estate in Mayfair and Wereldhave's London portfolio.\" The placing will help fund \u00a3213m of recent purchases and another \u00a3150m in negotiation. British Land is the latest in a string of property companies to raise cash to fund expansion. Rival shopping centre owner Intu Properties \u2013 shortly to be demoted from the FTSE 100 \u2013 recently announced plans to tap shareholders for funds to buy the Midsummer Place centre in Milton Keynes.

      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and US department of justice have opened investigations into the accusations of suspect accounting at the British technology firm Autonomy before its 2011 acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, the US technology company said on Monday. In a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), HP said it had been told that investigations were under way by the US and UK authorities on 21 November and 6 February respectively. Ironically, the SFO is itself an Autonomy user \u2013 in order to work through voice calls and emails for relevant information. On 11 February, a spokesman there declined to comment on whether it had opened any investigation. Mike Lynch, the billionaire co-founder and former chief executive at Autonomy \u2013 who left the company and HP in May 2012, just seven months after the acquisition \u2013 said at the start of March that he had heard nothing from HP and had heard nothing about investigations. A spokesperson for Lynch declined to comment on Monday night. The Guardian also understands that the SEC has approached Lynch in the past few days about the subject. HP announced last November that it was writing down the value of Autonomy by $8.8bn (\u00a35.9bn), having bought it for more than $10bn in summer 2011. Meg Whitman, the chief executive who took over as the acquisition was being completed, blamed a \"wilful effort\" to inflate the company's figures, and that they \"severely impacted HP management's ability to fairly value Autonomy at the time of the deal\". Lynch has blamed the problems \u2013 and the outflow of Autonomy staff from HP following the acquisition \u2013 on stifling management processes that made it impossible to keep the same startup spirit that he had aimed to foster with the staff. HP has alleged that there were \"serious accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and outright misrepresentations\" in Autonomy's business, but has provided no other detail. Lynch has repeatedly challenged the company to specify what it thought was wrong in the way that the business \u2013 once the biggest technology company on the London stock market \u2013 had misrepresented its accounts. Until the announcement, the only known investigation was by the FRS, the body which oversees accounting standards. In its filing, HP says that it has \"provided information to the UK Serious Fraud Office, the US department of justice and the SEC related to the accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and misrepresentations at Autonomy that occurred prior to and in connection with HP's acquisition of Autonomy\". It said: \"On 21 November, 2012, representatives of the US department of justice advised HP that they had opened an investigation relating to Autonomy. \"On 6 February 2013, representatives of the UK Serious Fraud Office advised HP that they had also opened an investigation relating to Autonomy.

The monthly market survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) found that the increased availability of cheaper home loans as a result of the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme (FLS) had led to a pickup in transactions.
