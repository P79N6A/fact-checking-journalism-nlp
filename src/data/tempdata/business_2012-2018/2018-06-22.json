      "bodyText": "It is the end of an era. On Friday House of Fraser\u2019s landlords agreed to a dramatic rescue plan that will trigger the closure of some of the UK\u2019s oldest and best known department stores. Landmarks such as Howells in Cardiff and Rackhams in Birmingham, which survived two world wars, could be boarded up early next year after being killed off by internet shopping. House of Fraser landlords backed the unpopular plan, which will result in the closure of 31 of its 59 department stores, including its Oxford Street flagship in London. The company voluntary arrangement (CVA), part of a rescue deal brokered by its Chinese owner, will result in about 6,000 job losses \u2013 but the alternative was to plunge into administration. \u201cThis was clearly a difficult decision to take but is ultimately the only one to secure our future,\u201d said House of Fraser\u2019s chief executive, Alex Williamson. The CVA is a prerequisite of a new investment deal agreed by House of Fraser\u2019s owner Nanjing Cenbest, which is chaired by one of China\u2019s richest men, Yuan Yafei. It has outlined plans to sell a 51% stake in the streamlined business to another Chinese company, C.banner, which owns Hamleys toy store. C.banner has promised to pump \u00a370m into the retailer. Landlords have been vocal in their opposition to the plan, arguing that they were being asked to shoulder financial losses while other creditors, such as its bondholders and shareholders, remain unscathed. Many stores are owned by institutional investors who manage pension funds and other investments on behalf of the public and rely on the income stream the rents produce. At a fractious meeting in central London, management were questioned by creditors for more than two hours. In the end, the company received the necessary 75% of votes to allow the CVA to proceed. The closures are a fresh blow to the UK\u2019s high streets, which are shedding stores and jobs at a faster rate than during the recession in 2009. Property experts calculate that 1m sq metres of store space has been dumped by retailers this year, which is more than in 2016 when the 160-store BHS chain went into administration. This trend is writ even larger in the US, with analysts predicting another record breaking year of store closures as the collapsed Toys R Us chain and struggling Sears group beat a retreat. This is on top of a dire 2017, when a staggering 9.75m sq metres of retail space was closed in America as struggling main street veterans, such as Macy\u2019s, found themselves on the ropes. When House of Fraser announced the plan this month its chair, Frank Slevin, gave a stark assessment of the 169-year old department store chain\u2019s predicament: \u201cOur legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base which, without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business.\u201d The shadow cast by the digital high street is getting ever bigger. Last year one in every five pounds Britons spent on shopping was online, with the biggest shifts in clothing and footwear. Analysts at Retail Economics consultancy firm predict 50% of clothing and household goods will be bought online within a decade, double the current level. The group of stores being closed by House of Fraser includes outlets in major cities such as London, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Cardiff, but others are dotted around the country in places such as Darlington, Shrewsbury and Carlisle. These once grand stores are left over from a golden age when every major regional town and city could support its own independent department store. The stores that will close \u2013 which employ 2,000 House of Fraser staff and 4,000 in concessions \u2013 are expected to continue trading until early 2019. \u201cThis is legacy space from a time when you were able to successfully trade a three or four storey shop in a medium-sized town,\u201d said Dan Simms, co-head of retail agency at Colliers International. \u201cWith department stores you have to shovel a lot of money in to get money out \u2026 stores at the top end like Selfridges and Harvey Nichols are managing to do this.\u201d On Tuesday, Debenhams warned of a fresh slump in profits as the retailer also struggles to reinvent itself in a punishing trading climate. Last year its boss, Sergio Bucher, admitted some of its shops looked tired and old and customers had to go on a \u201ctreasure hunt\u201d to find what they wanted, but tough trading conditions mean it has had to rein in plans to spend millions of pounds on store revamps. \u201cThe department store is not necessarily a doomed format, it has just become stale,\u201d said Richard Lim, the chief executive of Retail Economics. \u201cThey are incredibly expensive to operate and scale is a hindrance when you are trying to turn a business around. House of Fraser has got a mountain of debt so it doesn\u2019t have the money to innovate and refresh its stores.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Trump threatens tariff on European cars; Opec agrees to boost oil output - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up, after a busy day. Donald Trump has threatened to widen the mounting trade dispute between US and the EU by imposing a 20% tariffs on European cars. The move came as Brussels imposed retaliatory levies on American products including bourbon whiskey, Levi\u2019s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Shares in European carmaker fell following Trump\u2019s warning. Traders worried that tariffs could hurt carmakers such as BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, who all contribute to Europe\u2019s trade surplus in car sales. The Opel cartel has agreed to raise production levels. Oil producers agreed to boost output by up to one million barrels per day, following intense talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The oil price rose following Opec\u2019s move, as some analysts had expected a larger increase in production. The Bank of England has warned that the UK economy would be badly hurt if China\u2019s economy crashes. New research found that the City\u2019s tied to China and Hong Kong were greater than previously thought. Greece has welcomed last night\u2019s debt relief deal, that extends the maturity on some Greek bonds by a decade. Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has said the Greek government is \u201chappy with this deal\u201d, but will not forget the suffering of the last eight years. Creditors in House of Fraser have approved plans to close 31 of its 59 stores with the loss of up to 6,000 jobs. The 169-year old department store chain faced going into administration if its plan to shut stores and impose rent reductions on 10 other outlets was rejected. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW European carmakers would suffer badly if America imposed a 20% tariff on exports. The EU car industry is a major exporter -- selling \u20ac192bn of motor vehicles overseas in 2016. The US is the biggest single export market for EU carmakers, with 25% of all exports. That\u2019s followed by China (16%) and Turkey (7%), followed by Japan, South Korea, Russia, Australia, Norway and Canada. However, the European Union only imported \u20ac77bn of cars, meaning it ran a chunky surplus with the rest of the world. Turkish car factories contributed 20% of Europe\u2019s car imports, followed by Japan with 19% and then America with 14%. So European carmakers have more to lose if the car trade across the Atlantic were to freeze. Donald Trump\u2019s belligerent demand that European auto firms make cars in America ignores the fact that several already have large factories in the US. Daimler, for example, makes Mercedes SUVs in Alabama. BMW has a large factory in South Carolina. Both factories make cars for export abroad, so they could be badly hit if China imposes tariffs on US-built cars [which is why Daimler issued a profits warning on Wednesday night] Ironically, US carmakers such as Ford and General Motors have partnerships with Chinese firms - meaning most of the cars they sell in China are made locally. Thus, they won\u2019t be hurt by Chinese tariffs on imports. As the FT put it yesterday: It is one of the tantalising ironies of the trade war between the US and China: German carmakers BMW and Daimler could end up as the biggest losers. After decades of investing in American states that back Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party, the US\u2019s two largest car exporters by value are likely to be hurt most. Looking back at the Opec deal.... this chart suggests today\u2019s agreement won\u2019t make a massive difference to the oil market. It shows that Iraq, Iran and Venezuela are all unable to boost their production. So the total supply increase will be less than the headline figure of one million barrels per day. Britain\u2019s opposition Labour party has warned that tit-for-tat tariffs between the US and Europe will cost jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Barry Gardiner MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow International Trade Secretary, says president Trump\u2019s attack on Europe\u2019s steel industry will backfire. \u201cDonald Trump said he would welcome a trade war and could win it but the workers in the motorbike factories in Wisconsin, Missouri and Pennsylvania are the foot soldiers he is prepared to sacrifice. Nobody wins in a trade war and Donald Trump may finally come to realise that his attack on steel workers in Europe was not such a good idea after all, as the European Union is forced to reciprocate with retaliatory tariffs. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see a trade war and, ultimately, these tariffs need to be removed by both sides as we begin to work together to address the real issue of global overcapacity in steel and unfair market practices. Shares in European carmakers are falling, as Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs sends a shiver through the sector. Fiat has shed 2.6%, BMW are down 2.1% and Daimler (which issued a tariff-related profits warning this week) have lost another 1.1%. American auto-makers are also suffering; traders may be anticipating retaliatory action from Europe against US cars. Newsflash: Donald Trump has just threatened to impose fresh tariffs on European carmakers. In a tweet (what else?) the US president said his administration would make EU cars 20% more expensive in the US, unless Europe lowered its tariffs and barriers on US products. Trump\u2019s threat comes as Europe starts to impose fresh tariffs on US goods, in retaliation to America\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU. Bourbon whiskey, Levi\u2019s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes imported from the US are all on the list of US products which will now cost rather more in Europe. The oil price is continuing to strengthen following Opec\u2019s agreement - which will not please Donald Trump! Brent crude (sourced from the North Sea) is up over 2% now at $74.64 per barrel. US crude oil has jumped by 3%, or two dollars per barrel, to $67.58. Analysts at Danske Bank say today\u2019s agreement should keep oil prices up in the months ahead. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) today agreed to lift output by one million barrels per day, effective from 1 July. The aim of the deal is to return total compliance to the current output agreement to 100%. Compliance has been well above 100% this year since some countries, notably Venezuela, have seen a drop in production. The price of Brent crude rose about $1/barrel to above \u20ac75/barrel on the news. The fact that oil prices are rising when OPEC is returning supply to the market reflects a concern in the market heading into the meeting that OPEC would agree to raise output further than the level needed to ensure 100% compliance. For the rest of the year, the deal today reduces the upside risk to prices from the risk of lower output in, e.g. Iran and Venezuela, since OPEC now effectively has established a mechanism which opens the way for other countries to increase production correspondingly. Reminder, Iran has been unwilling to accept a supply boost, at a time when US sanctions are hurting its energy sector. Saudi Arabia, though, had pushed for an increase - under pressure from Trump to get energy prices down. Today\u2019s agreement looks (at first glance) like a compromise. Output will go up, but in practice by less than some analysts had expected. President Donald Trump may have missed the boat. He\u2019s just tweeted that Opec must \u201csubstantially\u201d increase oil production, but of course the agreement has already been announced. Unless Trump is getting his dissatisfaction in early... It\u2019s official: Opec has reached an agreement to raise oil production by up to one million barrels per day. UAE\u2019s energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei, who is also OPEC president, has just announced the plan in Vienna. It partly unwinds the 1.2m bpd cut which Opec agreed back in 2016, which helped to drive the oil price higher. Al Mazrouei told reporters that the increase is \u201ca little bit less than 1 million barrels\u201d above Opec\u2019s current output. However, in practice the increase will be less - because many Opec members aren\u2019t in a position to raise their output. Al Mazrouei said Opec had made \u201cthe best choice\u201d, balancing the interests of its members and other producers. Opec also hasn\u2019t revealed which countries will raise their output, and by how much. Leaving the meeting, Iran\u2019s energy minister said the deal added up to \u201cless than 700,000 barrels per day\u201d in practice. Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister, Khalid al Falih, said the agreement would allow countries with spare production capacity to boost output. Newsflash: House of Fraser has been given approval by creditors to close 31 stores, resulting in up to 6,000 job losses, the Press Association reports. That follows this morning\u2019s meeting with HoF\u2019s landlords, where they were asked to vote on a plan to shut more than half its stores and cut the rent on another 10 of its 59 outlets. Oxford Economics predicts that today\u2019s deal (if confirmed) will push the oil price higher. Journalists in Vienna are waiting patiently for the Opec press conference begin. There\u2019s chatter that today\u2019s communique will focus on getting Opec members to comply with the current production curbs. Britain\u2019s stock market is rallying hard today, partly thanks to the jump in the oil price. The FTSE 100 has gained 98 points, or 1.3%, to 7654 points. Mining companies and energy producers are leading the rally, with BP up 3% and Royal Dutch Shell up 2.7%. Or maybe not... An Opec announcement could be imminent... Back in the UK, the Bank of England has warned that China\u2019s economy poses a greater risk to Britain\u2019s financial stability than previously realised. New analysis from the Bank has found that a Chinese \u2018hard landing\u2019 would have a serious impact on the UK economy. If China\u2019s credit boom blows up, Britain will suffer serious economic harm, they say. As the BoE puts it: China\u2019s credit boom is now one of the largest and longest running ever recorded. Indeed, rapid credit expansions, such as China\u2019s, have typically preceded financial crises. The Bank\u2019s economists have forecast that a modest shock would knock 3% off China\u2019s GDP, and reduce UK GDP by up to 0.5%. A full-blown financial crisis that wiped 10% off China\u2019s economy would knock 1.4% off Britain\u2019s GDP, they believe. But the full impact could be twice as bad, due to \u2018amplification effects\u2019 that would drive down asset prices and rock the currency markets. The Bank warns: We find that the effects via standard channels from a modest fall in Chinese GDP are larger than our previous estimates, primarily due to China\u2019s increasing role in global trade. A more extreme shock which triggers amplification mechanisms \u2014 such as a larger financial market reaction \u2014 could potentially double the effects from the standard channels alone.... The financial market reaction to a China crash is as yet untested; hence, a more extreme shock to exchange rates and asset prices could occur, resulting in greater declines in demand for UK exports and wealth and investor confidence. The BoE has also calculated that the City is more exposed to China than previously thought, thanks to its links with Hong Kong. Unlike most countries, the UK is unique in having both sizable direct exposures to mainland China, and indirectly via UK banks\u2019 exposures to Hong Kong. Together, UK banks\u2019 exposures to mainland China and Hong Kong exceed exposures to the US, euro area, Japan and Korea combined, despite the UK economy being a fifteenth of the size of these economies combined. You can read the report here. There\u2019s nothing official from Opec yet.... Bloomberg and Reuters are both reporting that Opec has agreed \u2018in principle\u2019 to lift their production cap by one million barrels per day. That\u2019s what the Saudis have been lobbying for at today\u2019s meeting, following pressure from Donald Trump to push oil prices down. But the actual increase will actually only be 600,000bpd, compared to what\u2019s actually being produced today, as not every Opec member can boost production. Oil is actually pushing higher on the back of this news, with Brent crude now up 2% at $74.40 per barrel. Another newsflash from Vienna: Opec ministers have been discussing how to ensure everyone is fully complying with the supply freeze agreed in 2016: Reuters newsflash: OPEC SOURCE SAYS MINISTERS ARE NEARING AN AGREEMENT My colleague Adam Vaughan reports that Opec ministers are inching towards a deal. From Vienna, he writes: Major oil producers are set to pump around 1m more barrels a day to help cool crude prices as part of an Opec deal, according to Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister. Khalid Al-Falih said he was hopeful an agreement would be reached on Friday, minutes after meeting Iran, which has been the key holdout to a rise in output. Delegates privy to the negotiations in Vienna told the Guardian that talks had been fraught but they thought the cartel could maintain unity despite divisions. \u201cAn agreement was reached yesterday to release the equivalent of about 1m barrels to the market; it will be distributed pro rata,\u201d Al-Falih said on Friday, of an Opec committee meeting on Thursday. The deal has not been formally signed off yet, however. \u201cSaudi Arabia is unique. All of our spare capacity is available at short notice,\u201d he added. He acknowledged not all of the cartel\u2019s members could increase output, in a reference to countries such as Venezuela. More here: If you own an Aston Martin, then you\u2019re probably not short of a few bob already. But the luxury carmaker is keen that its rich customers should get even richer, by offering them cheap shares in its upcoming stock market float. Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman has the details: James Bond\u2019s carmaker is drawing up plans to hand millions of pounds of discounted stock to wealthy customers as part of a London listing expected to value it at up to \u00a35bn. Sky News has learnt that Aston Martin is working on incorporating a customer share offer into an initial public offering (IPO) that has been earmarked for the autumn. Details of the company\u2019s plans have yet to be finalised, but are expected to be unveiled alongside a new employee share scheme at the time of the long-awaited flotation. If it proceeds, the customer offer would form part of efforts by Aston Martin to build demand for its shares in what would be one of the City\u2019s most prominent stock market listings for many years. Of course, shareholders would normally only make gains if Aston Martin\u2019s shares rise after the float. But the beauty with discounted shares is that you\u2019re much more likely to make a profit..... Opec insiders report that the \u201cclosed door\u201d session of today\u2019s meeting has begun. With the cameras switched off, and no journalists in the room, this is the opportunity for energy ministers to agree production increases, or not.... Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the financial markets are increasingly edgy about today\u2019s Opec meeting. The clashes between Saudi Arabia and Iran over whether to increase production has created \u201ca growing sense of uncertainty\u201d, he says: And while Opec\u2019s deal is important, traders are also wondering whether the cartel can maintain its current agreement with Russia to curb production. That deal has been crucial in keeping output down, and prices up. Otunuga says: While Saudi Arabia and Russia have proposed to ease supply curbs, other members including Iran, Iraq, Algeria and Venezuela are against such a move. With Iran already storming out of preparatory discussions yesterday, investors should fasten their seat belts in preparation for potential fireworks today. If Iran continues to reject the deal to raise output and gathers support from other cartel members, talks are at risk of ending in an impasse. Such an undesirable outcome is likely to create uncertainty and will spark fears over the future of OPEC\u2019s 18-month agreement with Russia to limit production. A market-friendly outcome could be a scenario where Iran makes a last-minute U-turn to cooperate, consequently allowing Saudi Arabia and Russia to move forward with a gradual production increase. Newsflash: UK supermarket chain Asda has cut its fuel prices, in response to recent drops in the oil price. Asda is shaving 2p per litre off its unleaded petrol, and 1p per litre off diesel prices. This follows a fall in crude oil prices - with Brent dropping from $80 per barrel to $74 in the last month. Motorists suffered a surge in prices on the forecourt in recent weeks, as the oil price jumped to its highest levels since 2014. Asda\u2019s move suggests other retailers could also trim prices.... Iran\u2019s oil minister told has reporters that Opec won\u2019t simply take instructions from Donald Trump, who has been lobbying for lower oil prices. Associated Press has the details: Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said as the group met Friday that \u201cwe are not here to receive instruction from President Trump and apply it and implement it.\u201d Asked whether he supports increasing production, he replied: \u201cSome of the countries are against any increase, and ask them. I am not representative of them.\u201d As mentioned earlier, Zanganeh also said $70 per barrel was a \u201cvery good\u201d oil price, AP adds. Back in Vienna, security officers have now emptied the Opec meeting of journalists, so the serious negotiations can get underway. Here are some photos of the main players speaking to reporters: Back in London, landlords are arriving to vote on House of Fraser\u2019s proposal to shut half its stores and lay off 6,000 staff. Most people heading into the meeting refused to comment but those who did speak said they thought the vote would be approved. House of Fraser are making the cuts to preserve the rest of their business. If creditors reject the plan (a company voluntary arrangement), then the whole business could collapse. Today\u2019s Opec meeting has been difficult, Ecuador\u2019s oil minister Carlos Perez tells us. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Khalid Al-Falih tells us he\u2019s hoping to get a deal to increase production limits today. Across the conference room in Vienna, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh is also surrounded by journalists. Zanganeh is a crucial player at this meeting, having walked out of talks on a production increase yesterday. He says that this morning\u2019s meeting with the Saudi delegation was good, and that Iran is happy with oil at $70 per barrel (Brent crude is trading at $74 today). Asked if a deal will be reached today, Zanganeh says cryptically that \u201cwe are cooking something\u201d. Kuwait\u2019s oil minister says he will support a production increase of one million barrel\u2019s per day (Saudi Arabia\u2019s goal), or less. Boom: Iraq\u2019s oil minister has told Adam that a change in Opec\u2019s targets will \u201cdefinitely\u201d be agreed today. No-one\u2019s suggesting that supply targets will be reduced, so this suggests an increase will be waved through. Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih is surrounded by a gaggle of reporters seeking answers. He insists that no-one should expect to see an \u201cimmediate flood\u201d of oil onto the market following today\u2019s meeting. Oil supply release will be \u201cgradual\u201d, Al-Falih says, suggesting the impact of today\u2019s agreement won\u2019t be seen until the end of the summer. Al-Falih is talking about a \u2018nominal\u2019 increase in production of one million barrels per day, split between Opec and non-Opec members. But in practice the actual increase will be less, he reckons Finally, the oil ministers are taking their seats in Vienna. Energy reporters have been unleashed from their imprisonment on the stairwell, and are firing questions now.... While Saudi Arabia and Iran negotiate, scores of journalists are still kettled on a stairwell waiting to be allowed into the meeting. My colleague Adam Vaughan reports that some are even wearing trainers, to give them an advantage in the race to speak to ministers. Reuters\u2019 Amanda Cooper reports that other \u2018side meetings\u2019 are now taking place, as ministers continue to haggle about production levels... Here\u2019s a handy reminder of what the various Opec ministers hope to achieve today, from Jon Andersson, head of commodities at Vontobel Asset Management. Saudi Arabia want OPEC+ (OPEC and Russia) to increase production to please the US. In other words they want to show a \u2018bearish\u2019 headline number to demonstrate to the US that they are listening and playing their part in balancing the market. Russia wants OPEC+ to increase production because they together with Saudi Arabia are the only ones that can significantly increase production in the near and medium term. In addition they will not be able to increase production during the winter so they strongly favour a decision to increase now compare to later this year. Iran don\u2019t want OPEC+ to increase production because they will be forced to reduce production as a consequence of US sanctions. Current expected loss around 1 million barrels per day All the other OPEC and non OPEC participants will play along. So what might happen? Andersson sees two likely scenarios: If OPEC increase by 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day, that will offset the expected loss from Iran in H2. A possible (but unlikely) scenario is that Iran veto an production increase and that OPEC decide to postpone the decision to the next OPEC meeting in September. The Opec meeting is running late! The opening session should have started 45 minutes ago, but there\u2019s a hiatus. There\u2019s a rumour that Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh and his Saudi counterpart Khalid A. Al-Falih are holding a private meeting. Presumably they\u2019re trying to reach agreement on production limits before the meeting formally starts - when journalists are allowed to quiz minister. Amir Paivar of BBC Persian TV makes a good point: Why should Iran agree to boost Opec\u2019s production targets when US sanctions are squeezing Iranian supplies down? Last week Donald Trump tweeted that Opec was \u2018at it again\u2019 - keeping oil prices too high. Presumably the president wants to put pressure on the cartel, but this intervention means Iran won\u2019t want to lose face today..... A date for your diaries..... Impressive can-kicking, even by eurozone standards! Jake Robbins, Manager of the Global Alpha Growth Fund at Premier Asset Management, thinks Opec will probably agree to pump more oil at today\u2019s meeting. \u201cOPEC look likely to raise production targets for the first time since late 2016, with the likes of Russia looking to cash in on the much improved oil price since the introduction of the policy. OPEC has been surprisingly disciplined over the past couple of years and successfully pushed oil to levels that are now profitable for the majority of producers. \u201cUnfortunately for OPEC, the higher price has also encouraged further expansion from non-OPEC producers, most notably the US shale producers who have benefitted the most from OPEC\u2019s supply constraints. Now some members are keen to also make the most of the higher oil price, particularly many in the Middle East and Russia who require the cash to cover big budget deficits. Any increase will probably end the \u201cbull run\u201d in the oil price, Robbins adds, as it could lead to another oil glut. Anxiety over today\u2019s Opec meeting is pushing the oil price higher this morning. Brent crude has gained almost $1 to around $74 per barrel, a rise of 1.3%. That reflects uncertainty over whether Opec ministers will agree a production increase, and how large it will be. Analyst Daniel Lacalle thinks a 500,000 barrel per day increase is most likely - or just half what the Saudi\u2019s are aiming for. Despite Iran\u2019s resistance, Opec last night drew up a \u2018preliminary deal\u2019 to raise production by around one million barrels per day. But there\u2019s no certainty that Iran will back the deal today, as Bloomberg explains: In a night of drama in Vienna, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which includes Russia and Saudi Arabia, recommended a supply boost despite Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, the Iranian oil minister, walking out of the meeting and predicting OPEC won\u2019t convince him to back an increase. Iran could wield a veto over any formal deal on Friday, but such a move wouldn\u2019t necessarily prevent additional oil coming onto the market. Riyadh could seek to assemble a coalition of countries ready to pump more within their existing agreement, act unilaterally to boost output or abandon the 2016 cuts deal entirely. Today\u2019s Opec meeting is overshadowed by a raft of political tensions, from the Saudi-Iran proxy war in Yemen to Donald Trump\u2019s new sanctions against Iran. The AFP newswire points out that Washington is putting the Saudi\u2019s under pressure to lower the oil price, ahead of Congressional elections this autumn. Saudi Arabia, backed by non-member Russia, is now pushing to raise production again in order to meet growing demand in the second half of 2018. But the proposal has run into resistance from Iran, Iraq and Venezuela, who would struggle to immediately raise output and fear losing market share and revenues if other countries open the spigots. Iran is particularly vocal about its objections as it braces for the impact of fresh US sanctions on its oil exports after President Donald Trump quit the international nuclear agreement. But Riyadh, which cheered Washington\u2019s exit from the nuclear pact, is under pressure from Trump to boost output in order to lower oil prices ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections... More here... My colleague Adam Vaughan is attending the Opec meeting in Vienna. He\u2019s heard that a deal to raise oil production is \u201clikely today\u201d: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Opec oil ministers are meeting in Vienna today for a crunch meeting that could lead to a production boost, or could end in disagreement and disorder. The world\u2019s major oil-producing countries are under pressure from the US, China and Russia to pump more crude and bring down oil prices. But there are divisions at the heart of Opec. Saudi Arabia favours a supply boost, of perhaps one million barrels per day, but Iran, Iraq and Venezuela are all opposed. Yesterday, Iran\u2019s oil minister walked out of preparatory talks, raising the prospect that a deal won\u2019t be reached. This split threatens to undermine the consensus at Opec, two years after the group agreed a production freeze that helped to drive oil prices higher. Motorists, consumers, and countries which are net oil importers, would probably welcome a production increase - as it might prevent prices rising higher. Opec members, though, have enjoyed higher oil prices, so will be reluctant to burst the bubble. The meeting starts shortly, but a final decision may not come until Saturday when Russia (not an Opec member) joins discussions Also coming up today: Greece is celebrating after its eurozone creditors finally agreed a debt relief deal that will help Athens exit its bailout programme. Following late-night talks in Luxembourg, eurozone finance ministers hammered out an agreement to make Greece\u2019s huge debt pile more manageable. Under the plan, the repayment dates on almost \u20ac100bn of bailout loans will be pushed back 10 years, with the earliest repayment deadlines shift from 2023 to 2033. The eurogroup also agreed to hand Greece a final loan tranche of \u20ac15bn. That gives Athens a cash reserve of around \u20ac24bn as it returns to the financial markets in August. It\u2019s a significant moment, three years after Greece came to brink of leaving the euro area. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has hailed the decision, saying: \u201cIt took a bit longer than we expected, but ended in a very good way. I think it is the end of the Greek crisis ... a historic moment.\u201d But Greece\u2019s struggles aren\u2019t over. It will still be under strict supervision from its creditors, even after the bailout ends, and must run high budget surpluses for decades to come to bring its debt pile (at a staggering 180% of GDP) down. Meanwhile in the UK, high street chain House of Fraser is asking its creditors to vote on plans to shut more than half its stores. If the deal goes through today, 31 department stores will close with the loss of 6,000 jobs. If it is rejected, the company could fall into administration. What a choice...

In other words they want to show a \u2018bearish\u2019 headline number to demonstrate to the US that they are listening and playing their part in balancing the market.</li> <li><strong>Russia</strong> wants OPEC+ to increase production because they together with Saudi Arabia are the only ones that can significantly increase production in the near and medium term. In addition they will not be able to increase production during the winter so they strongly favour a decision to increase now compare to later this year.</li> <li><strong>Iran</strong> don\u2019t want OPEC+ to increase production because they will be forced to reduce production as a consequence of US sanctions. Current expected loss around 1 million barrels per day</li> <li>All the other OPEC and non OPEC participants will play along.</li> </ul> <p><strong>So what might happen?

      "bodyText": "On 31 March 1980, 6,500 workers at the Shotton steelworks were sacked on one of the darkest days for the British steel industry. Six miles away in Broughton, a town in north Wales on the border with England, there is a palpable fear that history could repeat itself. On Friday morning, workers at the site of the aerospace firm Airbus were left in shock after notices went up on trade union boards on the factory floor informing them of the company\u2019s warning that it could pull out of the UK. The wing assembly factory in Flintshire employs about 6,000 mainly local people. Generations of the same family have walked through its doors. Therefore, for many, it is not just the loss of a job but of a way of life. The company has its own football team nicknamed the Wingmakers who play in the Cymru Alliance League. There is a gym used by local people and plans in the pipeline for a new community centre. During the Broughton village carnival last week, Airbus sent apprentices to help out as well as sponsoring local charities and providing the float for the Rose Queen. The warning in a detailed Brexit assessment by Airbus has brought back painful memories for some of the older community members. When the steelworks closed, many of the men never found work again; whole families were devastated. Many Airbus workers now speak of a \u201cfight for their future.\u201d Derek Butler, a Flintshire town councillor who worked at the wing production plant for more than 20 years, described it as the \u201clifeblood\u201d of the community. He said: \u201cThis region was completely destroyed by the closure of the steelworks. We lived through some of the worst times; there was no work, it was totally and utterly devastating. It has taken a generation to bounce back from that. It is unimaginable what would happen if something similar were to happen again. I\u2019m not sure we would survive a second time.\u201d At the factory gates, David Lawless, 34, was just clocking off the morning shift as a Beluga aircraft took off, heading for the company\u2019s headquarters in Toulouse, France. He said the news came as a shock and there had been a mixed reaction from his colleagues. \u201cA lot of people are brushing it off and saying it won\u2019t happen, it\u2019s just talk, but the reality is companies are folding before Brexit has even happened. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen here,\u201d said Lawless. \u201cWe just need to try and stick together and hope that the government will fight for us.\u201d Lawless voted leave in the EU referendum but said he did not regret his decision.\u201cI was in two minds. I wanted to leave but obviously a lot of people were asking questions before about if we were to leave, how it would affect us,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were saying it would never affect us here because it\u2019s too big a company. I\u2019m still happy I voted for it but I thought we had more of a hold and a footing here in Broughton.\u201d Meanwhile, Peter Sinnott, 55, who has worked at the site since 1980, said workers had been expecting the news since the Brexit vote. \u201cOnce we had a border (with Europe), it was always going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cMr [Nigel] Farage knew the vote wouldn\u2019t affect him either way. It\u2019s every common man it affects. There are young men in there, lads with families and mortgages. It is them who this will affect the most.\u201d Speaking outside the factory on Friday, Darren Reynolds, the site convener for Unite the Union, said: \u201cThis site here employs 6,500 people. It\u2019s key to this area and the north-west to have the jobs that we do. You tell them about the infrastructure of the supply chain and everything around what we do \u2013 that comes out of the Broughton plant. However, they\u2019re not giving any answers.\u201d Reynolds said he had visited Downing Street twice this year to discuss the impact of Brexit with ministers but was not sure they understood the concerns. For father-of-one Kevin Mullens, the news has been terrifying. Mullens\u2019 father Billy retired from the plant last month aged 62. But Kevin, 34, continues to work there and cannot bear to think about a future without the security it offers. \u201cI have a one-year-old toddler and this is my livelihood. I have known nothing else since doing my apprenticeship and I have invested my life in the place. It couldn\u2019t get any worse if the factory were to start making redundancies. We would not know what to do.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 June 2018. An earlier version said the Wingmakers were played in the Welsh Premier League. The team was relegated from that league after 13 seasons, at the end of the 2016/17 season. They currently play in the Cymru Alliance League.",

    "webTitle": "UK faces risk from slump in China, warns Bank of England", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned that the health of China\u2019s economy poses a greater risk to the UK\u2019s financial stability than previously realised. New analysis from the Bank has found that a sharp economic slowdown in China would have a serious impact on the UK. If China\u2019s credit boom blows up, Britain would suffer serious economic harm, it says, adding: \u201cChina\u2019s credit boom is now one of the largest and longest running ever recorded. Indeed, rapid credit expansions, such as China\u2019s, have typically preceded financial crises.\u201d The warning came as the trade dispute between the US and China escalated this week, with Donald Trump threatening to impose tariffs on an extra $200bn (\u00a3152bn) worth of Chinese goods exported to the US on top of $50bn previously announced. China immediately said it would retaliate, increasing fears of a trade war which could send the global economy into a new slump. The Bank\u2019s economists have forecast that even a modest economic shock would knock 3% off China\u2019s GDP and reduce UK GDP by up to 0.5%. They said that direct links between the UK and China via trade were very small \u2013 only 4% of UK exports go to China. But China is a key player in global supply chains, meaning that indirect trade effects, for example via the euro area, are much more significant. A full-blown financial crisis that wiped 10% off China\u2019s economy would knock 1.4% off the UK\u2019s GDP, they believe. But the full impact could be twice as bad, due to \u201camplification effects\u201d that would drive down asset prices and rock the currency markets. The Bank warned: \u201cWe find that the effects via standard channels [trade, financial links and commodities] from a modest fall in Chinese GDP are larger than our previous estimates, primarily due to China\u2019s increasing role in global trade. \u201cA more extreme shock which triggers amplification mechanisms \u2013 such as a larger financial market reaction \u2013 could potentially double the effects from the standard channels alone. \u201cThe financial market reaction to a China crash is as yet untested; hence, a more extreme shock to exchange rates and asset prices could occur, resulting in greater declines demand for UK exports and wealth and investor confidence.\u201d The Bank has calculated that the City is more exposed to China than previously thought, owing to its links with Hong Kong. It said: \u201cUnlike most countries, the UK is unique in having both sizeable direct exposures to mainland China, and indirectly via UK banks\u2019 exposures to Hong Kong. \u201cTogether, UK banks\u2019 exposures to mainland China and Hong Kong exceed exposures to the US, euro area, Japan and Korea combined, despite the UK economy being a 15th of the size of these economies combined.\u201d There is another risk which the Bank has not included in its calculation, which is Chinese investment in UK property and which it says is difficult to estimate. But it added: \u201cIt appears that investment from Asia has risen notably since 2010 and accounted for over 40% of London commercial real estate purchases in 2017, up from only 6% in 2010. And as flagged in the [Bank\u2019s] financial stability report, London commercial real estate valuations look stretched.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Airbus hated Brexit from the off but, until now, it had confined itself to soft expressions of worry in public and harder lobbying behind the scenes. Its dramatic warning that it could stop investing in the UK is a radical departure from that position and carried a sting. The aircraft manufacturer did not merely say a no-deal outcome to Brexit talks \u201cdirectly threatens Airbus\u2019s future in the UK\u201d. It also said an \u201corderly\u201d Brexit, complete with a trade agreement and a transition period, would also be risky. In effect, the group will freeze investment in the UK until it can judge how a new set-up would work and how many extra costs its UK factories and research centres would bear. John Longworth, the co-chair of Leave Means Leave campaign, accused Airbus of running a scare story and reheating Project Fear. Tariffs on aeronautical products are zero, he argued, and so \u201cnothing will change\u201d if the UK leaves the customs union. Yet he overlooked the detail of the Brexit assessment by Airbus, which barely mentioned tariffs. Instead, the worries were about the movement of employees between the UK and the EU, logjams in the supply chain and aircraft regulations. The most critical issue on that list is probably UK membership of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which certifies aircraft parts and runs safety checks. In theory, the Civil Aviation Authority could do the job in the UK, as it once did, but Airbus doubts the body could assemble the expertise in time to provide a smooth transition. Norway is a non-EU member of EASA and so the UK, if it is prepared to accept the European court of justice as the legal authority behind EASA\u2019s rulings, could also stay within. But a deal has not yet been struck, which is one of many reasons why Airbus is shouting that time is running short. Its supply chain frustrations will be shared by other large manufacturers with cross-border operations that run on a just-in-time basis to keep costs low. The fear of \u201cchaos at the borders\u201d in 2020, as Tom Williams, the Airbus executive in charge of the commercial aircraft division, put it, is real. Downing Street\u2019s talks about aiming to \u201cminimise\u201d friction is no longer reassuring: at this late stage, big business wants technical details rather than good intentions. Airbus plainly cannot move 14,000 UK employees and its sophisticated equipment out of the country overnight. But it says it will \u201crefrain from extending its UK suppliers/partners base\u201d because any likely transition period will be too short to make full adjustments to the supply chain. In other words, delay and ambiguity is already costing investment. And, for the longer term, the Airbus warning about \u201crepatriating competencies and patents\u201d was an unsubtle reminder that it \u2013 and not the UK \u2013 owns much of the intellectual property used in aircraft design and manufacture. Hardline Brexiters may conclude that Airbus, a huge Franco-German company in an industry that is not a stranger to skulduggery, is stirring the pot on behalf of EU politicians. An alternative conspiracy theory says the company is using Brexit as a cover to shift production to China over the long term. Unfortunately, both interpretations look too elaborate. Its Brexit assessment seems to be what it claims to be: a hard-nosed analysis of specific economic risks. Some of those risks have solutions, not least the EASA question, but the general frustration in the boardrooms of big companies is now intense. They accept Brexit will happen \u2013 but they want to see a vaguely coherent plan.",

    "webTitle": "Trump threatens car tariffs after EU sets up \u00a32.5bn of levies on US", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has threatened to widen the mounting trade dispute between US and the EU by imposing tariffs on European cars, after Brussels made good on its threat of retaliatory levies on American products including bourbon whiskey, Levi\u2019s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Raising the stakes in the tit-for-tat exchange of import tariffs threatening to spark a global trade war, the US president tweeted in response to the EU tariffs which came into effect late on Thursday: \u201cIf these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!\u201d Trump\u2019s new threat comes after the EU imposed tariffs on a range of US consumer goods in response to steel and aluminium tariffs from the White House, which could increase the cost of consumer goods by \u00a3200m per year in the UK alone. Should Trump carry through the levy, it would have damaging consequences for jobs and economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. Leaders from American and European car manufacturers have previously said such measures would lead to net job losses in the US. The US is the biggest market for EU car exports, accounting for 25% of the \u20ac48bn (\u00a342bn) total in 2016, when Germany accounted for just over half of all EU car exports and the UK had the second biggest share, at 13%. Shares in US and European carmakers fell, including Ford, General Motors, Fiat, BMW and Daimler. The US opened a new front in the trade war on Friday, telling the World Trade Organisation that appeals rulings in trade disputes could be vetoed if they took longer than the allowed 90 days. The statement by the US ambassador, Dennis Shea, threatened to erode a key element of trade enforcement at the 23-year-old WTO: binding dispute settlement, which is widely seen as a major bulwark against protectionism. The tariffs from Brussels imposed on consumer goods \u2013 designed to target producers in Republican states where Trump draws much of his support \u2013 were introduced from 11pm (BST) on Thursday on US goods worth up to \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.5bn). The White House had refused to exempt its traditional allies from worldwide tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump argues are necessary to protect US jobs and industry. The president is also threatening China with tariffs worth up to $200bn over alleged \u201cunfair\u201d trading practices. The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, said this week the 28-nation bloc was left with no other choice but to impose tariffs of its own after the \u201cunilateral and unjustified decision of the US\u201d. Brussels drew up the list of products in March when Trump first floated the idea of 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminium. Although American goods already in the UK will not increase in price, shipments leaving the US for Europe from Friday onwards will be charged the tariffs. Customs agents across the EU internal market of 500 million people will impose the duty, hiking prices on US-made products in supermarkets and across factory floors. The EU tax on imported goods in the UK will be collected by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, with some of those duties staying within the country, but the cost for importers, such as wholesale firms and supermarkets, will rise and is likely to be passed on to consumers. Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics, estimated the tariffs could add \u00a3200m to the cost of consumer goods in Britain. In 2017, consumers in the UK spent about \u00a3406bn on retail purchases. \u201cThough the immediate effects on UK retailers might look relatively modest, it is worth paying close attention to this dispute because it\u2019s future course is unpredictable, fast moving and could quickly escalate to engulf other, seemingly unrelated areas of trade,\u201d he said. Most economists say the consequence of higher international import tariffs will drive up costs for consumers, offsetting much of the benefit of protecting domestic industries for the country imposing them. Analysts at the Oxford Economics consultancy said the consequences for the European economy could be contained in the short term, as the affected imports only account for about 1% of all goods coming into the EU from the US, although it warned tariffs on cars would have a greater negative impact. The EU will impose an additional \u20ac3.6bn of tariffs if the dispute is still active in three years\u2019 time. European consumers would be able to find alternatives, said the European commission vice-president for trade, Jyrki Katainen. \u201cIf we chose products like Harley-Davidson, peanut butter and bourbon, it\u2019s because there are alternatives on the market. We don\u2019t want to do anything that would harm consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, these products will have a strong symbolic political impact.\u201d What US products will be hit by the tariffs? Motorcycles (eg Harley-Davidson) Peanut butter Orange juice Cranberries Kidney beans Sweetcorn Rice Jeans (eg Levi\u2019s) Cigars, cigarettes and tobacco Bourbon whiskey Makeup (eg MAC, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique) Grilling appliances Yachts (eg Sea Ray cruisers) Playing cards Bed linen Knives and forks Sinks",

Leaders from American and European car manufacturers have previously said such measures would lead to net job losses in the US.</p> <p>The US is the biggest market for EU car exports, accounting for 25% of the \u20ac48bn (\u00a342bn) total in 2016, when Germany accounted for just over half of all EU car exports and the UK had the second biggest share, at 13%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2018-06-22T16:55:21/embed.html\" data-alt=\"EU car exports\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2018-06-22T16:55:21/embed.html\">EU car exports</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2018-06-22T16:55:47/embed.html\" data-alt=\"EU car imports\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2018-06-22T16:55:47/embed.html\">EU car imports</a> </figure>  <p>Shares in US and European carmakers fell, including Ford, General Motors, Fiat, BMW and Daimler.</p> <p>The US opened a new front in the trade war on Friday, telling the World Trade Organisation that appeals rulings in trade disputes could be vetoed if they took longer than the allowed 90 days. </p> <p>The statement by the US ambassador, Dennis Shea, threatened to erode a key element of trade enforcement at the 23-year-old WTO: binding dispute settlement, which is widely seen as a major bulwark against protectionism.</p> <p>The tariffs from Brussels imposed on consumer goods \u2013 designed to target producers in Republican states where Trump draws much of his support \u2013 were introduced from 11pm (BST) on Thursday on US goods worth up to \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.5bn).</p> <p>The White House had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/31/us-fires-opening-salvo-in-trade-war-with-eu-canada-and-mexico\">refused to exempt its traditional allies</a> from worldwide tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump argues are necessary to protect US jobs and industry. The president is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/trump-china-tariffs-200-billion-threat\">threatening China with tariffs worth up to $200bn</a> over alleged \u201cunfair\u201d trading practices.</p> <p>The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, said this week the 28-nation bloc was left with no other choice but to impose tariffs of its own after the \u201cunilateral and unjustified decision of the US\u201d. </p> <p>Brussels drew up the <a href=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2018/may/tradoc_156909.pdf\">list of products</a> in March when Trump first floated the idea of 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminium.</p> <p>Although American goods already in the UK will not increase in price, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eu-measures-in-response-to-us-steel-and-aluminium-tariffs?utm_source=fc44d9ad-1271-463a-ad7d-8320db11c891&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=immediate\">shipments leaving the US for Europe</a> from Friday onwards will be charged the tariffs. </p> <p>Customs agents across the EU internal market of 500 million people will impose the duty, hiking prices on US-made products in supermarkets and across factory floors.<br></p> <p>The EU tax on imported goods in the UK will be collected by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, with some of those duties staying within the country, but the cost for importers, such as wholesale firms and supermarkets, will rise and is likely to be passed on to consumers.<br></p> <p>Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics, estimated the tariffs could add \u00a3200m to the cost of consumer goods in Britain. In 2017, consumers in the UK spent about \u00a3406bn on retail purchases.</p> <p>\u201cThough the immediate effects on UK retailers might look relatively modest, it is worth paying close attention to this dispute because it\u2019s future course is unpredictable, fast moving and could quickly escalate to engulf other, seemingly unrelated areas of trade,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Most economists say the consequence of higher international import tariffs will drive up costs for consumers, offsetting much of the benefit of protecting domestic industries for the country imposing them.<br></p> <p>Analysts at the Oxford Economics consultancy said the consequences for the European economy could be contained in the short term, as the affected imports only account for about 1% of all goods coming into the EU from the US, although it warned tariffs on cars would have a greater negative impact. The EU will impose an additional \u20ac3.6bn of tariffs if the dispute is still active in three years\u2019 time. </p> <p>European consumers would be able to find alternatives, said the European commission vice-president for trade, Jyrki Katainen. \u201cIf we chose products like Harley-Davidson, peanut butter and bourbon, it\u2019s because there are alternatives on the market. We don\u2019t want to do anything that would harm consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, these products will have a strong symbolic political impact.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p><br></p> <h2>What US products will be hit by the tariffs?</h2> <ul> <li>Motorcycles (eg Harley-Davidson)<br></li> <li>Peanut butter<br></li> <li>Orange juice<br></li> <li>Cranberries<br></li> <li>Kidney beans<br></li> <li>Sweetcorn<br></li> <li>Rice<br></li> <li>Jeans (eg Levi\u2019s)<br></li> <li>Cigars, cigarettes and tobacco<br></li> <li>Bourbon whiskey<br></li> <li>Makeup (eg MAC, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique)<br></li> <li>Grilling appliances<br></li> <li>Yachts (eg Sea Ray cruisers)<br></li> <li>Playing cards<br></li> <li>Bed linen<br></li> <li>Knives and forks<br></li> <li>Sinks<br></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Major oil producers have agreed to pump more crude to help reduce prices and prevent a supply shortage, in a significant reversal of Opec\u2019s strategy of curbing output over the past 18 months. After a fraught meeting in Vienna in which Iran was initially at odds with a Saudi-led drive to boost production, ministers settled on a target they said would increase output by around 1m barrels per day (bpd). Donald Trump, who has blamed the cartel for recent oil price highs, appeared to welcome the deal. \u201cHope Opec will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!\u201d the US president tweeted after the agreement. However, analysts and ministers said the actual amount of extra oil is likely to be around a third lower than the headline 1m figure. Joe McMonigle, an energy analyst at HedgeEye, said: \u201cI suspect we will eventually get some calculations from Opec but [the] lack of details is bullish not bearish for oil prices.\u201d Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up nearly 2% to $74.47 (\u00a356.12) a barrel, shortly after the agreement was announced. It hit $80 a barrel last month before falling back. The oil cartel also failed to spell out how the extra production would be allocated among members, a key question as several have no capacity to pump more crude. Friday\u2019s deal centres on how closely countries have stuck to production cuts that have been in effect since the start of 2017, driving a recovery in oil prices. Opec said the cuts of 1.2m bpd had been far exceeded \u2013 at 158% in May \u2013 so in Vienna the group agreed to target 100% compliance instead. That would equate to an effective increase of around 1m bpd. Roger Diwan, a veteran Opec observer and analyst at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThat\u2019s a fudge for sure.\u201d He said the agreement paved the way for the Saudis to pump more, while the Iranians could sell the deal domestically by saying they had blocked a bigger increase. Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said the kingdom was ready to increase production. \u201cSaudi Arabia is unique. All of our spare capacity is available at short notice,\u201d he said. However, he said the impact of the increase would not be felt until the end of summer, because crude would take weeks to reach markets. The minister acknowledged that not all of the cartel\u2019s members were in a position to increase output. Crisis-hit Venezuela has suffered a nosedive in production, while Iran\u2019s exports are due to be hit by US sanctions, so neither are in a position to increase supplies. Iran failed in its effort to shoehorn a coded criticism of the US into the Opec communique. Suhail al-Mazroui, the UAE energy minister and meeting\u2019s president, suggested the agreement represented a good compromise. \u201cI think for the group to agree that we target that collective 1.2[m bpd] level is something that is good for us. That takes into account the differences between the different countries,\u201d he said. After nearly two years of relative unity at Opec as the group cut production to rebalance supply and demand, the talks in Vienna this week found the cartel divided. After arriving on Tuesday, Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh threatened to veto any agreement to raise output, though he eventually reached agreement with his Saudi counterpart on Friday. Observers had said earlier in the week that, \u201cthe body language has been awful\u201d. The Ecuadorean oil minister, Carlos P\u00e9rez, when asked if the talks had been fractious, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult situation.\u201d But he added the cartel hoped to continue its unity despite the disagreements.",

      "bodyText": "Here we go again. The Bank of England has restarted its drumroll in preparation for a rate hike. Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, has joined the rate-risers, expanding their number to three. As a whole, the nine-strong committee stuck to its line that the miserable 0.1% growth in GDP in the first quarter was a weather-induced blip. Its view that momentum will recover in the April to June quarter was deemed to be \u201cbroadly on track\u201d. Financial markets got the message. The pound rose and the likelihood of a rate-rise to 0.75% in August is now priced as a 65% probability. In outline, the Bank\u2019s analysis is reasonable. It can point to surveys that show a strong bounce-back in household spending once the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d went away. Employment is also rising, although wages aren\u2019t following at the same pace. And, as it says, \u201cthe prospects for global GDP growth remain strong\u201d even if the euro-area and a few emerging markets currently look soft. Yet, come August, broad strokes of the brush won\u2019t suffice. At a bare minimum, second quarter GDP would have to arrive at 0.4% to justify a rate rise. That was the forecast in the Bank\u2019s inflation report in May. Anything less than 0.4% and the bounce-back narrative would look like a fundamental misreading of the health of the economy. Not everyone is convinced 0.4% is in the bag. \u201cIn our view, there is not enough evidence of a strong rebound in the data so far,\u201d say Barclays\u2019 economists. They may have the bleak numbers from the construction and manufacturing sectors in mind. The Bank, then, has talked itself into yet another test of its forecasting ability and the second-quarter GDP numbers, to be released at the end of July, are suddenly a big deal. February\u2019s drumroll was even louder before the Bank was obliged to delay the rate rise it plainly wants. A repeat performance would not look good. Dixons and Carphone \u2013 no longer a merger of equals Back in 2014, Dixons and Carphone Warehouse declared theirs was a \u201cgenuine\u201d merger of equals. In the sense that each set of shareholders got 50% of the combined company, it was. But only one side of the business is vaguely pulling its weight these days. Here\u2019s new chief executive Alex Baldock on Thursday on what\u2019s happened to returns from selling mobile phone contracts in the UK and Ireland, Carphone\u2019s main contribution to the whole: \u201cA business that was making in excess of \u00a3100m will be barely profitable this year.\u201d As recently as 2016, the split between electricals (the Currys and PC World chains from Dixons) and mobile was roughly even. The causes of Carphone\u2019s calamities are well-known. Consumers are upgrading their handsets less often and, even when they do, they are less interested in the pre-pay deals that are Carphone\u2019s specialism. Meanwhile, the chain is locked into contracts with the big mobile networks that require it to hit volume targets. And the boost from the demise of rival Phones 4u, which also happened in 2014, is now lost in the wash. Baldock, like predecessor Seb James, is attempting to reinvent the model by negotiating new contracts with EE, 02 and Vodafone but only an optimist would predict old levels of profitability can be restored. There are two morals to the tale. First, the excitable merger talk about how Carphone\u2019s mobiles would soon be \u201ctalking\u201d to Currys fridges was guff: the commercial arrangements with mobile networks were always far more important. Second, Carphone\u2019s Sir Charles Dunstone got the better end of the deal. The combined group\u2019s share price has fallen 40% since the merger but Carphone, if it had continued in standalone form, would be in even deeper trouble today. WPP gets some free advice from Martin Sorrell Down in Cannes, Sir Martin Sorrell was in chatty mood \u2013 just not about the reason why he resigned from WPP in April. Instead, after complaining about rough treatment from the board of the advertising and marketing giant, he riffed on who should replace him as chief executive. Mark Read and Andrew Scott, currently doing the job jointly on a temporary basis, should get the gig permanently, he said. They would be \u201ca very powerful and potent combination\u201d, he argued. The chances of a joint appointment happening are roughly zero. Having two chief executives is asking for trouble and shareholders usually hate the idea. In any case, WPP has already said it won\u2019t go down that route. Sorrell is making mischief.",
