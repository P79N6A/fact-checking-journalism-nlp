      "bodyText": "The share of national income going to Australian households is close to a 50-year low, and now \u201clies towards the bottom of the international ladder\u201d, an economist has warned. Bureau of Statistics data show labour\u2019s share of gross domestic product has fallen to 51.5%, down from 54.2% in the third quarter of last year. At the same time, the profit share of GDP has risen from 24.5% to a five-year high of 27.5%. Paul Dales from Capital Economics said Australian households had not seen \u201cone cent\u201d of the extra income generated by recent soaring commodity prices because \u201cit\u2019s all gone into the pocket of business\u201d. He said the share of national income going to households was now \u201cwithin a whisker\u201d of a 50-year low and a meaningful cyclical or structural upturn in that share of income was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d if jobs growth and wages growth remained so low. \u201cThe share of the economic pie that households currently enjoy isn\u2019t just small by Australia\u2019s own standards, it\u2019s also small by international standards,\u201d Dales wrote in a note to clients. \u201cAs a share of GDP, the compensation of Australian employees lies towards the bottom of the international ladder. That\u2019s not always been the case. \u201cBack in 1975, Australia households received a bigger share of the economic pie than households in the US, France and New Zealand. Only in the UK did the compensation of employees account for a larger share of GDP. \u201cBut the downward trend in labour\u2019s share of GDP over the past 40 years has been more marked in Australia than in those other economies, apart from New Zealand.\u201d This trend in most economies was mainlybecause of structural changes that had reduced the bargaining power of employees, including globalisation, the increased flexibility of the labour market and technical innovation, which had flattened firms\u2019 cost curves, Dales said. \u201cBut the larger decline in Australia may be partly because of the rise in the importance of the mining sector, which tends to generate relatively large profits while employing relatively few workers,\u201d he said. The news comes as the British Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, says the face of British politics has changed after Theresa May\u2019s snap general election leaves Britain with a hung parliament 11 days before Brexit talks begin. \u201cPeople have said they\u2019ve had quite enough of austerity politics, they\u2019ve had quite enough of cuts in public expenditure, under-funding our health service, under-funding our schools, our education service, and not giving our young people the chance they deserve in our society,\u201d Corbyn said. In Australia, the Labor party is developing a position on the negative economic consequences from persistently low wages growth, with broader policies to crack down on worker exploitation. The party\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, signalled plans on Thursday to strengthen the bargaining power of workers and unions in an attempt to revitalise stagnant wages. Her intervention in the low-wages debate followed a speech last month by Brendan O\u2019Connor, Labor\u2019s employment and workplace relations spokesman, in which he Labor\u2019s intention to make it harder for employers to terminate enterprise agreements.",

      "bodyText": "The pound fell to an eight-week low and shares in housebuilders, banks and retailers lost ground after the shock election result, which increased uncertainty over both the forthcoming Brexit talks and the UK\u2019s economic prospects. But the currency recovered from its worst levels as Theresa May announced she was forming a new government with the help of the Democratic Unionist party and vowed to press ahead with Brexit negotiations. So after falling 2.5% to $1.2635, its lowest since 18 April, sterling stood at $1.2737, down 1.65%, when London trading closed. Against the euro, it slumped to a seven-month low of \u20ac1.1289 but recovered to \u20ac1.1380, down 1.5%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread betting firm Spreadex, said: \u201cThough the current chaos is bad news for the instability-averse pound, if it leads to a softer Brexit it may end up working in the currency\u2019s favour. Of course, that is a big if, meaning for now sterling is focused firmly on the latest bout of political turmoil.\u201d On the stock market the FTSE 100 \u2013 packed full of companies with big overseas earnings which benefit from a weaker pound \u2013 rose just over 1% to 7527.33 while the FTSE 250, down initially, recovered after the DUP talks to close up 0.13% at 19,769. But UK-focused companies were hit by concerns about a further squeeze on consumer spending following the latest fall in the pound and the fallout from the election. Analysts at UBS said: \u201cSuch significant political uncertainty will further dampen sentiment and confidence, exacerbating the weakness we have already been starting to see over recent months.\u201d Among the market\u2019s leading fallers were Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments, and retailers Marks &amp; Spencer and Next. Construction groups such as Balfour Beatty dropped sharply on worries that a hung parliament could slow down the award of government contracts. Meanwhile business leaders called for a new government to focus its efforts on the economy and the Brexit discussions. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said: \u201cThere has never been a more important time to refocus on the economy and plan with confidence and ambition. The next government needs to deliver an open, competitive and fair post-Brexit economy that works for everyone across all our nations and regions. \u201cWith only 10 days before Brexit talks begin, the UK needs to be fast out of the blocks. Agreeing transition arrangements and guaranteeing EU citizens\u2019 rights should be early priorities to get the talks off to a good start and show to the world that trade and people come first.\u201d Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the electorate\u2019s split decision would generate further uncertainty for businesses \u201cwho are already grappling with currency fluctuations, rising costs, and the potential impacts of Brexit\u201d. He said companies had been doing their best to screen out political noise for months to focus on their own operations, but warned: \u201cThis result will prove much harder for UK businesses to ignore.\u201d Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers\u2019 organisation the EEF, said business had got used to political uncertainty in recent years but warned it was now essential that politicians \u201cput industry first\u201d. Scuoler added: \u201cThe Brexit negotiating strategy requires a careful rethink. Industry should be at the table \u2026 to help ensure we have the right negotiating position, which is something that\u2019s been sadly lacking until now.\u201d Ratings agencies warned of further possible downgrades to the UK\u2019s credit rating. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, which a year ago stripped Britain of its prized triple-A rating, after the Brexit vote, said: \u201ca further downgrade or downgrades could be in the wings . Kathrin Muehlbronner, a senior vice-president at Moody\u2019s and lead UK sovereign analyst, said: \u201cThe future path of the UK sovereign rating will be largely driven by two factors: first, the outcome of the UK\u2019s negotiations on leaving the European Union and the implications this has for the country\u2019s growth outlook. Second, fiscal developments, given the country\u2019s fiscal deficit and rising public debt.\u201d A third credit ratings agency, Fitch, said a second poll could not be ruled out: \u201cWhile [the DUP deal] would avoid a prolonged period of coalition talks, the terms of the agreement are unclear and another election in the near term is possible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The pound initially fell 2.5% against the dollar after the shock election result, but had recovered some ground by the time London markets closed. It was still down 1.6% at $1.2740 but was off its eight week lows against the US currency. Even so the decline gave some support to the FTSE 100 and its overseas earners, while news that Theresa May was forming a government - even if with the help of the DUP - provided some support for shares and the pound. European and US markets shrugged off the UK result, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a new peak as investors preferred to concentrate on the latest twists in the Donald Trump saga.Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Although the pound fell, the FTSE 100 as well as other global indices opened higher on election result day. Traditional havens like gold and the Japanese yen dropped as global markets shook off the result as a UK-only affair. The closing scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 77.35 points or 1.04% at 7527.33 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.8% to 12,815.72 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.67% at 5299.71 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.38% better at 21,122.42 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.23% at 10,978.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.39% to 782.10 ahead of next week\u2019s key eurogroup meeting On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 100 points or 0.5%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. But don\u2019t forget our politics blog is still going, with all the latest developments in the wake of the election result: The ratings agency also warns another election could be on the horizon (!): Prime Minister Theresa May will seek to form a government with support from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, known as the DUP, after her governing Conservative Party fell short of a parliamentary majority. While this would avoid a prolonged period of coalition talks, the terms of the agreement are unclear and another election in the near term is possible. Fitch added: The election increases the possibility of looser fiscal policy. The Conservative manifesto aims to balance the UK budget by the middle of the next decade, later than previously planned, although detailed tax and spending proposals were broadly consistent with March\u2019s budget. But Labour\u2019s stronger-than-expected performance after campaigning for higher public spending and investment funded by higher corporation tax and other tax increases suggests that \u201causterity fatigue\u201d is a meaningful factor in UK politics. Meanwhile a minority or Conservative-led coalition government may have to compromise on the pace of fiscal consolidation or specific policy measures to maintain parliamentary support (the reversal of proposals to increase social contributions for the self-employed in March\u2019s budget highlighted a degree of inflexibility in fiscal policy making). The possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum has receded after the Scottish National Party lost 21 MPs compared with the previous election in 2015, although it remains the largest party in Scotland. We will continue to assess the UK\u2019s sovereign creditworthiness with reference to the resilience of its economic growth prospects and its public finances as the domestic political situation develops and Brexit talks begin. We affirmed the UK\u2019s sovereign rating at \u2018AA\u2019/Negative on 5 May. The next scheduled review is on 27 October. Fitch has now chimed in on the election result and says, unsurprisingly, it will cause uncertainty: The UK general election result creates uncertainty over the policy platform, political cohesion and longevity of the next UK government, Fitch Ratings says. This will have implications for Brexit and potentially fiscal policy. The political, economic and institutional uncertainty stemming from the June 2016 Brexit referendum and the upcoming UK-EU negotiations is reflected in the Negative Outlook on the UK\u2019s \u2018AA\u2019 sovereign rating. If the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiating stance remains unchanged despite the election result, that would a negative according to Deutsche Bank. Analysts Oliver Harvey and Mark Wall said: We see the initial move lower in the pound on the election result as justified. The election has resulted in a weaker rather than a stronger UK government, which will make negotiations with the EU27 more difficult. The medium-term outlook will depend on the tone of the Prime Minister\u2019s stance on Brexit and fiscal policy over the next few hours and days. A course towards softer Brexit, and even a second referendum, has potentially been opened, albeit is highly path-dependent. But if the UK government sticks with existing Brexit plans in a much weaker domestic political position, significant sterling and/or economic weakness would again be required to shift the UK away from a crash Brexit. On that front, we view the Prime Minister\u2019s just-delivered speech on the steps of Number 10 as extremely negative. As well as confirming that Brexit negotiations will begin on schedule in 10 days\u2019 time, the speech made no concessions to the Conservatives\u2019 weak showing last night or the clear electoral rejection of hard-Brexit plans. Just a reminder. The latest political developments after the shock UK election result are in our live blog here: The shock UK election result has had little effect on US markets, which have been more concerned about the latest revelations surrounding Donald Trump, notably Thursday\u2019s testimony from ex-FBI boss James Comey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 60 points , while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened up around 0.13%. UK government bonds could fall back if the new administration decides to boost the domestic economy. Chris Iggo at Axa Investment Managers said: Britain hasn\u2019t been doing elections (referendums) very well recently. Last year\u2019s vote on European Union (EU) membership and the General Election of 2017 have not resulted in the desired outcome for the two people that called the vote... More importantly, Britain faces huge uncertainty about its place in the world together with significant internal divisions. Going forward, one strategy might be to make sure people feel better about the domestic economy at least, in case things don\u2019t go well with Brexit. That may mean less austerity. From the UK bond market point of view, interest rates are not likely to move but gilt yields could rise if the new government thinks allowing some fiscal slippage is an acceptable price to pay for staying in power. Gilts could underperform US Treasuries and Bunds as a result, and break-even inflation rates could move back to their highs of earlier this year. More on UK GDP, and Capital Economics has looked at how it has been affected by political uncertainty: The UK economy was seeing subdued growth ahead of the election, according to think tank NIESR. Its latest estimate of GDP showed output growing by 0.2% in the three months to the end of May, the same as during the three months ending in April. This is below its long term trend of 0.6%, it said. NIER\u2019s James Warren said: The subdued performance of the economy in the three months to May was driven by weakness in the production sector, offset by a mild rebound in services. The current political backdrop may lead to greater uncertainty and a drag on growth prospects, in particular business investment, which contracted in 2016. In the light of the election result, NIESR director Jagjit Chadha, added: The subdued performance in the economy throws the political turmoil of a hung Parliament into sharp relief. People are looking for answers to low levels of economic growth, limited improvements in productivity and falling real wages. That none of the parties wholly addressed our long run problems or how we ought to address exit from the European Union is the reason there was no clear winner. NIESR\u2019s most recent economic forecast, published in May, suggested GDP growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.9% in 2018. Richard Watts, manager of Old Mutual\u2019s UK Mid Cap Fund, isn\u2019t convinced by Theresa May\u2019s pledge to carry on as prime minister. He argues that a hung parliament election make a \u2018softer\u2019 Brexit, or even no Brexit at all, more likely: Rather than strengthening her position, she has been significantly weakened, perhaps fatally. It is not clear that she can hold on to her position of prime minister, although she has announced that she intends to do so. In 10 days\u2019 time, talks are set to start with the EU over the terms of the UKs withdrawal from the EU. In our view, the election result has called in to question the government\u2019s mandate for a hard Brexit. It also appears that the DUP favours a soft Brexit and may make this the price of doing a deal with the Conservatives. What this means for Brexit is unclear but it makes a soft Brexit, or no Brexit more likely, in our view. This may not be a bad thing for the UK economy. However, the timing of talks could be delayed as Theresa May seeks to form a government, which adds another level of complexity to the negotiations. Watts also thinks that Jeremy Corbyn could have dealt a massive blow to austerity, even though he didn\u2019t actually win the election: With a continuation of a Conservative-led government, we do not expect any major policy changes. If anything, we may see a fiscal easing. It\u2019s obvious that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity policies have resonated very strongly with parts of the electorate. In time, this could be good for UK domestic cyclical stocks. Over in Downing Street, Theresa May has just returned from her audience with the Queen - and announced that she is forming a new, minority government. It will be a government that can \u201cprovide certainty and lead Britain forward\u201d at this critical moment, she says -- not acknowledging the uncertainty created by yesterday\u2019s election. Over the next five years we will build a country in which no-one and no community are left behind, she insists. Whart the country needs more than ever is certainty, and having secured the largest number of votes and the greatest number of seats, only the Conservative and Unionist party can provide it, May continues. She confirms that she will work with the DUP, and pledge to deliver a \u201csuccessful Brexit deal\u201d that works for everyone. Now let\u2019s get to work, she concludes, before marching back into Downing Street. It\u2019s almost as if that pesky election didn\u2019t happen. Today\u2019s hung parliament shock is reminiscent of a similar political crisis over forty years ago. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: When it closed for business on election day, the City of London was in confident mood. Theresa May was Margaret Thatcher. Jeremy Corbyn was Michael Foot. Labour\u2019s manifesto was, if not the longest suicide note in history, the second longest. Opinion polls were pointing to a Tory majority of about 100, which is what Thatcher got in her second general election victory. By 10pm when the results of the exit poll were released, it dawned on the City that this was not a rerun of 1983 but of 1974. May was not Thatcher, she was Ted Heath, a prime minister lacking the human touch who had called an election when there was no need to do so. With a hung parliament pointing to the possibility of a second general election within months \u2013 another echo of 1974 \u2013 the markets responded in predictable fashion by dumping the pound. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full analysis: Here are some predictions from another heavyweight global investor, Allianz Global Investors: The UK election result may augur a more pragmatic approach to Brexit and increase the likelihood of a \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit, perhaps even retaining access to the single market. Our high-conviction view is that the Bank of England will put rate rises on hold for the next 2-3 years, or longer. The election reinforces such a view. Speculation about another election puts downward pressure on sterling but economic data is likely to be the key driver. A weak government or coalition probably means that fewer contentious manifesto pledges can be enacted \u2013 although there may still be action on utilities. Time for a quick recap. The pound has suffered heavy losses in volatile trading, as the impact of Britain\u2019s inconclusive general election ripples through the City. Sterling tumbled over three cents against the US dollar this morning to an eight-week low of just $1.265, putting it on track for its worst daily loss since the EU referendum. It also slumped to a seven-month low against the euro, at just \u20ac1.13, as investors warned that Theresa May could be forced to resign after failing to secure a majority. But the pound is now clawing its way back, after May seemingly secured a deal with the Northern Irish DUP for a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d arrangement that can keep her in Downing Street. Theresa May is heading to Buckingham Palace right now, to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Sterling is currently trading at $1.275, down two cents or 1.5% since the exit polls struck, after a wild morning. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx says the DUP deal has calmed the City, a little: The pound gradually pulled back from the brink this morning, though the currency still finds itself in a very bad way following the shock general election result. As expected, Theresa May appears to have made an agreement with the DUP, whose 10 seats in Northern Ireland would allow the Tories to just about manage a parliamentary majority. While the pound is obviously pleased that May is set to visit the Queen at midday to seek permission to form a government \u2013 therefore likely avoiding another election in a few weeks times \u2013 the unstable nature of such a government, and what that means for the Prime Minister\u2019s ability to negotiate with the EU, has only seen sterling erase the top layer of its losses. Several major City firms have also voiced their concerns: Legal &amp; General suspects that Theresa May could face a rebellion from angry colleagues UBS has predicted greater volatility for UK assets such as the pound JP Morgan has predicted that Britain won\u2019t be ready to hold Brexit talks in mid-June Citi has warned that May could be forced to step down Many UK companies have suffered losses on the stock market today; shares in housebuilders and banks have fallen, due to concerns that the UK economy will struggle. Royal Bank of Scotland are the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 3.2%, followed by building firms Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey. Retailers such as M&amp;S and Next have also dropped, on fears that a weaker pound will drive up inflation, hurting consumer spending. Utility firms has risen, though, as the threat of being nationalised by Jeremy Corbyn seems to have faded. After jumping in early trading, the FTSE 100 has dipped back -- currently up 34 points, or 0.5%, at 7484 points. Multinational companies who will benefit from cheaper pound are rallying, such as drinks firm Diageo and fashion chain Burberry. The FTSE 250, which is a better gauge of the UK economy, has shed 100 points or 0.5% to 19639. Business leaders are extremely unimpressed by the situation; the British Chambers of Commerce says it\u2019s essential that the UK has a functioning government, while the CBI urged Westminster to get its house in order. Credit rating agencies are also watching the situation closely; S&amp;P has warned that Britain\u2019s credit rating could be cut. Legal &amp; General Investment Management, one of the City\u2019s biggest investors, is concerned that the governance of Britain \u2018hangs in the balance\u2019. Hetal Mehta, LGIM\u2019s senior European economist, says: \u201cTheresa May could face a rebellion, as some in her party might blame her for losing both a sizeable lead in the opinion polls and valuable Brexit negotiation time. This could mean that her position might become much weaker, possibly to the extent that she will have to stand down, thereby triggering a leadership contest. As we saw after the EU referendum last year, the Conservatives can pull together relatively quickly to elect a leader, but the risk is that the process is long and drawn out over the summer. \u201cIf the Conservatives become preoccupied with internal party politics, the chances of forming a minority government quickly may be lower, although an arrangement with the DUP is emerging as a likely outcome. \u201cHowever, the situation is extremely fluid, and it is worth remembering that back in 2010 the coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats took six days to form, and that was when that partnership was amongst the likely outcomes. As such, the uncertainty and political wrangling is unlikely to lift quickly.\u201d UK retailer Sports Direct has told the City that it won\u2019t suffer from the drop in the pound, as it\u2019s \u2018fully hedged\u2019. In a statement, it says: Following the outcome of yesterday\u2019s general election, and in view of the associated market volatility, in particular to sterling / dollar exchange rates, Sports Direct International plc is pleased to confirm that its sterling / dollar exchange rate is fully hedged for FY18 at 1.31. Last October, Sports Direct (which pays for some of its imports in dollars) issued a profits warning after a currency hedge backfired when the pound suffered a \u2018flash crash\u2019. That cost the firm \u00a315m -- at a time when it was trying to improve its image following the exposure of poor working practices at its Derbyshire warehouse. The Greek government is leading enthusiastic applause in Europe\u2019s austerity-wracked south for the election result, says Helena Smith in Athens Describing the result of his \u201cfriend\u201d Jeremy Corby as exceptional, Prime minister Alexis Tsipas has just tweeted: \u201cThe left that dares can inspire and mobilise people.\u201d Earlier the Greek government spokesman had called the outcome a resounding rejection of the politics of austerity. Royal Bank of Canada believe that investors might welcome a Conservative alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party: If the numbers do allow the Conservatives to form a coalition with the DUP then things could be fairly stable. If not there could be a lot of inertia as it isn\u2019t easy to see how else the Conservatives would be able to form a stable coalition to drive things forward. Uncertainty about government policy on Brexit and the Budget\u2026and all sorts of other things would be unhelpful and probably be seen as a drag on consumers and businesses. It would be difficult to assume a successor Conservative leader would follow the same Brexit strategy as Theresa May. Willem Buiter, global chief economist at Citigroup, says Theresa May is effectively a \u2018lame duck\u2019 PM. He told Bloomberg TV that it\u2019s now unlikely that Britain will start its Brexit negotiations on June 19th as planned. Buiter also argues that the odds of the UK breaking up have fallen, as the SNP lost seats in yesterday\u2019s election. The only thing that has changed is that nationalism within Britain, Scottish nationalism, has had a black eye. This is intriguing. Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman has heard that Britain\u2019s banking regulator has been quietly checking whether customers have been taking out more cash than usual today. The City of London Corporation (the Square Mile\u2019s local authority) hopes a new government is formed fast, before the markets are plunged deeper into uncertainty. They\u2019re also pushing against a hard Brexit deal that would hurt the UK\u2019s financial sector (which, they say, creates \u00a372bn in tax income.) Policy chairman Catherine McGuinness said: \u201cThe City of London would wish to see an effective and secure Government formed as soon as possible. \u201cMarkets do not like instability. \u201cIt is also important for the prospect of successful Brexit negotiations that we have certainty in the political system. \u201cIn these negotiations with the EU we would hope any new Government recognises the importance of two-way market access, a transitional agreement and the ability of talented people across Europe to get access to the best jobs. Two of Britain\u2019s leading high street retailers have been hit by worries over the UK economy following the general election. Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer and Next have fallen by more than 2.5% this morning, making them some of the worst performing shares on the FTSE 100. Investors are worried that retailers will suffer from the slump in the pound, which will drive up import costs and fuel inflation, hitting shoppers in the pocket and eating into real wages: Stock broking firm N+1 Singer explain: Depending on coalition talks, or if another election is needed, this picture could deteriorate further. Overall, this is negative for domestic consumer stocks, especially those reliant on foreign sourcing and an above average age demographic. Just in: Theresa May is planning to ask the Queen\u2019s permission to form a new government. That suggest she\u2019s got the support of the DUP for some sort of alliance.... Our Politics Live blog has all the action: A second rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has just weighed in -- warning that Britain could suffer a credit rating downgrade. It\u2019s nearly a year since S&amp;P stripped Britain of its prized triple-A rating, after the Brexit vote. And S&amp;P\u2019s chief ratings officer, Moritz Kraemer, has told CNBC that a fresh downgrade is possible. He said: \u201cWe have the outlook on the ratings still on negative indicating that further downgrade or downgrades could be in the wings going forward. \u201cThis depends pretty much on the further outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the reality that the U.K. will face outside the EU, which is still uncertain.\u201d Kraemer added that Britain is building up \u201cquite a track record\u201d of destabilising votes. The pound has clawed its way back over $1.27, following reports that the Conservatives could form an alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party. As explained earlier, the DUP have won 10 seats - enough to provide a wafer-thin working majority if added to the Conservative\u2019s haul. There are reports from Westminster that the DUP are considering a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d deal, to support the Conservatives on key issues (but not a full-blown coalition). That has helped sterling recover from this morning\u2019s eight-week low, but it\u2019s still down over two cents, or 1.7%, since the polls closed. There are also signs that May is determined to stick on as PM. Our politics editor Heather Stewart says: Senior Conservatives confirmed that May has no intention of resigning and is instead working to form a government, most likely by making a pact with Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP, which has 10 MPs. \u201cWe won the most seats and the most votes,\u201d one Tory source said. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby has also heard that May\u2019s colleagues are sticking with her, for now anyway: Credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s says it is watching events in Westminster, and will work out the implications for Britain\u2019s credit rating. Kathrin Muehlbronner, a Moody\u2019s senior Vice President, says: \u201cMoody\u2019s is monitoring the UK\u2019s process of forming a new government and will assess the credit implications in due course. As previously stated, the future path of the UK sovereign rating will be largely driven by two factors: first, the outcome of the UK\u2019s negotiations on leaving the European Union and the implications this has for the country\u2019s growth outlook. Second, fiscal developments, given the country\u2019s fiscal deficit and rising public debt.\u201d The EEF, which represents Britain\u2019s manufacturers, wants the next government to rethink its Brexit strategy. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, says: \u201cThe Brexit negotiating strategy requires a careful rethink. Industry should be at the table, alongside whatever administration is formed, to help ensure we have the right negotiating position, which is something that\u2019s been sadly lacking until now. \u201cThe main parties have championed an industrial strategy for Britain and this must not be a casualty of the political turmoil. It is the best blueprint for business in the current circumstances.\u201d Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019ll be an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Britain\u2019s utility firms are emerging as a surprise winner from the election. Shares in power and water companies have risen this morning, as the City concludes that Labour won\u2019t be in a position to nationalise them. Theresa May\u2019s pledge to cap bills may also be moving off the agenda..... There\u2019s no chance of sterling being \u201cstrong and stable\u201d anytime soon, warns Viktor Nossek, director of research at wealth manager WisdomTree. He predicts the pound will suffer further losses as politicians try to deal with consequences of Theresa May\u2019s failed gamble. The pound has tumbled overnight, and this could be just the start, with volatility likely to remain elevated. Indeed, as the ramifications of this vote become clearer, the falls against the US dollar and other currencies could become more pronounced. \u201cLooking across markets in general, uncertainty will reign as parties try to form a government, so expect an increase in volatility in the near term. The pound has now hit an 11-week low against a basket of currencies. It is on track for its biggest one-day fall in almost a year (since the aftermath of the Brexit referendum), Reuters reports. Jake Trask, FX research director at foreign exchange and international payments firm OFX, fears the pound could have further to fall: \u201cUK Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s horrendous miscalculation to have a snap election has hammered sterling overnight. After the Brexit vote and Trump\u2019s win, the polls have again proved to be untrustworthy and sterling has tanked as result. A Tory majority was priced into the market but the reality of a hung parliament has seen the pound drop from $1.2950 to $1.27. Theresa May has yet to make a statement over her future, however should she decide to step aside we may see the pound take another leg down\u201d. The British Chambers of Commerce has warned that Britain\u2019s businesses will be damaged unless a functioning government is formed, fast. Dr Adam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s director general, says: \u201cThe formation of a workable administration that can give voters and businesses confidence around economic management must be the immediate priority. \u201cWhilst companies have for many months done their best to screen out political noise in order to focus on their own operations, this result will prove much harder for UK businesses to ignore. The swift formation of a functioning government is essential to business confidence and our wider economic prospects. Marshall adds that he can\u2019t see how Brexit talks can begin until Britain has \u201cclear objectives, an agreed starting position, and a strong negotiating team.\u201d Although Britain\u2019s political turmoil has shunted the pound, it isn\u2019t causing too much damage to other assets, reports Jill Treanor from IG\u2019s trading floor: The FTSE 250 index, which consists of small and medium-sized UK companies, has fallen by 0.5% at the open. That highlights the concerns over the British economy today. Outsourcing firm Capita are leading the fallers, down almost 5%. DING DING: The London stock market is open, and the FTSE 100 has jumped by 85 points, or over 1%, to 7535 points. That\u2019s only 65 points away from its record high. Multinational companies such as Diageo, Unilever and Burberry are leaving the risers - as they\u2019ll all benefit from the slump in the pound. But..there are plenty of losers this morning too. UK banks and housebuilders are among the big fallers, showing that the City is worried that the election will harm the economy. Analysts at Liberum say: We would expect UK Housebuilders\u2019 shares to be weak following the surprise General Election result as the economic outlook has now become much more uncertain. Increased uncertainty would be expected to slow house purchases and make the sector less appealing. Theresa May\u2019s decision to hang on as prime minister is worrying the City, and driving the pound lower, says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. \u201cSterling took another leg lower as looks like Theresa May will grimly cling on as PM despite a disastrous night for her. The pound dipped half a cent, slipping from a fairly comfortable looking $1.27 to $1.265 in pretty short order, and was last trading at $1.264 as it is on course for its biggest fall since October. May stepping aside creates uncertainty, but trying to stay as leader looks like it may even more unpredictable and uncertain for markets. Political gridlock is the key here and this doesn\u2019t look good for sterling. The CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s businesses, has issued a magisterial plea to Westminster\u2019s politicians to get a grip. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said: \u201cThis is a serious moment for the UK economy. The priority must be for politicians to get their house in order and form a functioning government, reassure the markets and protect our resilient economy. \u201cPoliticians must act responsibly, putting the interests of the country first and showing the world that the UK remains a safe destination for business. It\u2019s time to put the economy back to the top of the agenda. \u201cFor the next Government, the need and opportunity to deliver an open, competitive and fair post-Brexit economy that works for everyone across all our nations and regions has never been more important. There\u2019s no relief for the pound yet today, as the selloff intensifies. Breaking: Political journalists are reporting en masse that Theresa May has \u201cno intention\u201d of resigning. That\u2019s sending the pound even deeper into the mire; now down almost three cents at $1.2660, a new eight-week low. Swiss bank UBS fears that Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union just became an even bigger problem. Mark Haefele, global chief investment office at UBS, says: We believe the Conservatives are ultimately likely to be able to form a minority government, but they have been severely weakened by the vote. The unexpected outcome increases the threat of further volatility for sterling and UK assets. The result is likely to call the position of the Prime Minister into question, the government is likely to be relatively weak, and the result further complicates the upcoming Brexit negotiations, due to start on June 19. A tighter political balance could make it easier for Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party and potential partners to prevent the government from offering the compromises needed to secure a trade deal. Brexit talks are now likely to be even more unsettling for markets, and the prospect of another election raises the risk of a delay, potentially leaving the UK without a negotiated exit settlement. The chatter on the trading floors today is that the Conservative Party could form a coalition with the Democratic Unionist Party. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: Clearly, the fact that the Conservatives will be able to get past the 326 line with the help of Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP is probably allowing markets, at least at this early stage, to keep a sense of perspective. But... that would only create a very small majority. The Tories are on track for around 319 seats while the DUP have 10. That\u2019s barely half of the 650 seats in parliament, so hardly the \u2018strong and stable\u2019 government Theresa May was looking for. Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg says: The early speculation is that the Conservatives and the pro-Brexit DUP (Democratic Union Party \u2013 N. Ireland) could enter a coalition. But with 329 seats between them, the working majority would be very slim. No doubt there will be speculation of another Conservative-Lib Dem government. But the Lib Dems want another referendum on Europe. That would be a tough sell for the Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party. Here\u2019s the state of play, with just a handful of seats still to declare: Our election results tracker has all the details: Bad news for holiday makers: The pound has just hit a new five-month low against the euro, at \u20ac1.1322. That means one euro buys 88.3p. Alex Stubb, the former Finnish prime minister, agrees that Brexit talks probably shouldn\u2019t begin in 10 days time (as currently scheduled). The pound has hit a new eight-week low of $1.269, down over 2.5 cents since the exit poll landed at 10pm last night. These photos from inside City firm ETX Capital show how traders were shocked by the election results: Investment bank JP Morgan reckons that Britain will be forced to seek a delay in its Brexit negotiations. Those talks are due to begin on 19 June, but as things stand there\u2019s no certainty that Britain will have a stable government in place. Malcolm Barr, economist at JPMorgan, writes: \u201cPerhaps the most obvious conclusion is that the likelihood of the UK needing to request a delay in the Brexit process has risen substantially, given the chance that political developments in the UK disturb what is already a time-compressed process.\u201d The prime minister (at the time of writing) identified this issue herself, in a tweet that hasn\u2019t aged particularly well.... The pound is losing ground against the US dollar as more City workers arrive at their desks in London. Sterling has now hit $1.271, down almost two and a half cents. That\u2019s close to the seven-week low struck around 1.30am today as election results flowed in. Traders have just heard that Theresa May will give a statement at 10am. Our City editor Jill Treanor spent election night in London\u2019s hectic trading floors. Here\u2019s how it unfolded: Gasps greeted the exit poll at 10pm. The City had been expecting Theresa May to win the election - quite possibly with a landslide. The exit poll showing that a hung parliament was real possibility had an immediate impact on the pound. It slumped as much as 2% in a matter of minutes -and has been treading water ever since. At World First, chief economist Jeremy Cook spent the evening explaining that it was ticking higher and lower as each seat came in. Few wanted to believe the exit poll - and the early seats appeared to show that the poll had overestimated Conservative Party weakness. As dawn broke, it became clearer that the exit poll had called the result much better than had first been expected. At IG, the analysts reckoned the \u201cshock of the result is not really translating into the market\u201d. This is in part because the City is trying to work out if Brexit will now be delayed or soft with possible talk that the UK will ask to remain in the single market. The loss of seats for the SNP may also help take Scottish independence off the table. Waiting for the stock market to open at 8am, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \u201cBritain\u2019s inconclusive election means it is a question of when, not if, the country heads to the polls again in the near future\u201d. The slide in sterling meant the FTSE 100 was being called higher. But at IG they were also ready to watch the FTSE 250 index - made up of domestic stocks and less protected by sterling\u2019s slide. Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that the pound will be very volatile as investors come to terms with a hung parliament. \u201cMarkets were not primed for the prospect of uncertainty today. The dramatic change to the political and economic status quo will be unsettling to investors. \u201cThe purest way of playing macro-political risk is through sterling, and we may see a good deal of the markets\u2019 worries played out through currency. The short-term outlook points to higher volatility. In the first instance, it is likely that the pound will give up the bulk of its post-election announcement gains.\u201d Investment bank Citi have predicted that Theresa May will step down as prime minister, and believe that a second general election is possible. In a research note, they say: \u201cA period of political uncertainty lies ahead. Following what is widely regarded as a poor campaign and failure to translate a strong lead in the polls into a larger majority in the Commons, we expect May is likely to resign.\u201d The pound could suffer further heavy losses following Theresa May\u2019s election disaster, warns Lee Hardman, currency analyst at Japanese financial group Mitsubishi UFJ . \u201cThe consensus that this election was all about consolidating Theresa May\u2019s leadership is now shattered. Market hopes were pinned firmly on a stronger mandate as the UK government begins Brexit negotiations. Without question, there is volatility ahead. The market is desperate for any indication of what a Brexit deal might look like.\u201d \u201cIf negotiations go well, this could translate into a 1.30 to 1.35 range for the pound versus the dollar. But if the market anticipates a hard Brexit, the pound could drop to 1.20 to 1.25 against the dollar.\u201d Although the pound has slumped, City traders are actually expecting the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares to rise slightly. That\u2019s partly because the slump in sterling is good for multinational companies listed in London. My colleague Jill Treanor is on the trading floor of IG in London, and reports: Good morning. The people have spoken, sending the pound sliding as a wave of confusion ripples through the financial markets. Theresa May\u2019s decision to call snap general election has backfired in the most spectacular fashion. With most seats declared, the Conservative Party have failed to win the landslide majority they were aiming for. Instead, Britain is waking up to a hung parliament. Sterling plunged to a seven-week low as soon as the shock exit poll was released at 10pm last night. It has been buffeted through the night as traders digest this latest political shock, wiping off two cents to $1.2750. It also suffered heavy losses against the euro, down 1.5% to \u20ac1.138. As Jeremy Cook of World First put it, during a gruelling all-nighter: \u201cCurrencies like governments with mandates \u2013 and don\u2019t like delays to Brexit.\u201d This chart shows the initial slump, and the volatility since: It\u2019s been a night of wild drama, perhaps best summed up by Labour claiming the usually safe Conservative seat of Canterbury for the first time ever. Right now there are rather more questions than answers. Theresa May\u2019s position as prime minister looks insecure, even though the Conservatives will be the largest party. Will Britain need a second election within months? How can the UK government now push for a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019, given this result? Could we even see a second referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU? One thing\u2019s sure; it\u2019s been quite a night for Jeremy Corbyn.... We\u2019ll be tracking all the financial reaction through the day.",

Analysts Oliver Harvey and Mark Wall said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We see the initial move lower in the pound on the election result as justified. The election has resulted in a weaker rather than a stronger UK government, which will make negotiations with the EU27 more difficult. The medium-term outlook will depend on the tone of the Prime Minister\u2019s stance on Brexit and fiscal policy over the next few hours and days. A course towards softer Brexit, and even a second referendum, has potentially been opened, albeit is highly path-dependent. But if the UK government sticks with existing Brexit plans in a much weaker domestic political position, significant sterling and/or economic weakness would again be required to shift the UK away from a crash Brexit. </p> <p>On that front, we view the Prime Minister\u2019s just-delivered speech on the steps of Number 10 as extremely negative. As well as confirming that Brexit negotiations will begin on schedule in 10 days\u2019 time, the speech made no concessions to the Conservatives\u2019 weak showing last night or the clear electoral rejection of hard-Brexit plans. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593aac53e4b0be3ed1924a8d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-09T14:10:53.671Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Just a reminder.

NIER\u2019s James Warren said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The subdued performance of the economy in the three months to May was driven by weakness in the production sector, offset by a mild rebound in services.

It is not clear that she can hold on to her position of prime minister, although she has announced that she intends to do so. In 10 days\u2019 time, talks are set to start with the EU over the terms of the UKs withdrawal from the EU. In our view, the election result has called in to question the government\u2019s mandate for a hard Brexit. It also appears that the DUP favours a soft Brexit and may make this the price of doing a deal with the Conservatives. What this means for Brexit is unclear but it makes a soft Brexit, or no Brexit more likely, in our view. This may not be a bad thing for the UK economy. However, the timing of talks could be delayed as Theresa May seeks to form a government, which adds another level of complexity to the negotiations. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>Watts also thinks that Jeremy Corbyn could have dealt a massive blow to austerity, even though he didn\u2019t actually win the election:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a continuation of a Conservative-led government, we do not expect any major policy changes. If anything, we may see a fiscal easing. It\u2019s obvious that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity policies have resonated very strongly with parts of the electorate.

But if the market anticipates a hard Brexit, the pound could drop to 1.20 to 1.25 against the dollar.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-09T05:20:27.346Z\">at 6.20am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-593a2ccde4b0be3ed19247f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-09T05:10:12.104Z\">6.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Although the pound has slumped, City traders are actually expecting the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares to rise slightly.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s partly because the slump in sterling is good for multinational companies listed in London.</p> <p>My colleague Jill Treanor is on the trading floor of IG in London, and reports:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/873041154668810240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So looks as if FTSE could open higher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGcom\">@IGcom</a> tell me - possibly 20 points higher than Thursday&#39;s close</p>&mdash; Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/873041154668810240\">June 9, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/status/873032842749464582\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So this the \u00a3v$ on screens at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGcom\">@IGcom</a> Big spike down is when the exit poll was published.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy made a lacklustre start to the the second quarter, according to official figures on Friday that added to gloom about the UK\u2019s growth prospects following the inconclusive election results. Manufacturing output and broader industrial output made only small gains in April, dashing economists\u2019 forecasts for a rebound for the economy after a slow start to 2017, which has put the UK at the bottom of the European growth league. Firms and consumers have been under pressure from rising prices since last year\u2019s Brexit vote knocked the pound sharply lower, making imports to the UK more expensive. Higher inflation has curbed consumer spending with knock-on effects for the wider economy. The pound dropped again on Friday after the snap election called by Theresa May resulted in a hung parliament rather than the increased majority she had hoped to achieve ahead of Brexit negotiations with the rest of the EU. The figures from the Office for National Statistics suggested the economy was already struggling before this latest bout of political uncertainty. They showed manufacturing output rose 0.2% in April after falling 0.6% in March. That was well below economists\u2019 forecast for a 0.9% rise in a Reuters poll. Output for the broader industrial sector, which also includes utilities and mining, also rose 0.2% in April, rebounding from a 0.5% fall in March but again below forecasts for 0.8%. Construction output also missed expectations but Britain\u2019s trade performance improved. The figures painted a picture of a \u201csomewhat precarious UK economy\u201d, said Jack Coy at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy. \u201cWith the service sector clearly stuttering, hopes of a stronger performance from the industrial sector failed to materialise this month. The trade figures provide some crumbs of comfort, but while the deficit narrowed in monthly terms, UK exports have shown little sign of picking up considerably so far in 2017,\u201d he added. Construction output was weaker than expected in April but figures for the first three months of 2017 were revised up. Britain\u2019s trade deficit narrowed more than forecast in April as imports dropped sharply. There was little sign that the pound\u2019s drop was helping drive up exports, despite making UK goods cheaper overseas. Export volumes slipped on the month. The signs of a sluggish start to the second quarter follow news that the UK economy grew just 0.2% in the first quarter, making it the worst performer in the European Union and also bottom of the league among the world\u2019s advanced economies. That was a stark contrast with the close of 2016 when the economy confounded predictions from the Bank of England and others for a post-referendum slump. The latest figures suggested the production and construction sectors were on course to provide a negligible contribution to GDP growth again in the second quarter, said Ruth Gregory at the consultancy Capital Economics. But she highlighted the narrowing in the trade deficit and recent business surveys that have pointed to a pickup for the manufacturing sector. \u201cLooking ahead, there is clearly a risk that today\u2019s election result causes growth to weaken towards the end of the second quarter,\u201d Gregory added. \u201cThat said, this is unlikely to spell disaster since the economy has proved pretty resilient to political uncertainty in the recent past.\u201d Samuel Tombs at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said the latest batch of official figures was consistent with slow growth again in the second quarter. \u201cApril\u2019s modest rise in industrial production reverses only a tiny fraction of the 1.8% fall between December and March and so will increase concerns that the overall economy is stagnating,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking ahead, we expect manufacturing output to revive slowly, as moderate growth in exports offsets weakness in domestic demand. Even so, industrial production is on track to barely rise at all again in the second quarter, ensuring that overall GDP growth struggles to better the first quarter\u2019s 0.2% rise,\u201d he said. Some business surveys have suggested exports have been boosted by the weaker pound and stronger global demand. But the official trade figures for April showed export volumes fell 0.1% while import volumes dropped 5.1%. That helped narrow the deficit on Britain\u2019s goods trade to \u00a310.38bn from \u00a312.05bn in March, better than forecasts for a \u00a312bn trade gap. Adding in the services sector, which includes activities such as banking and legal services, the deficit almost halved to \u00a32.1bn from \u00a33.9bn in March. But it widened over the three months to April compared with the previous three months on the back of a rise in the value of imports.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mars has recalled some Galaxy chocolate bars, packets of Minstrels and Maltesers Teasers across the UK and Ireland after warning that the products might contain salmonella. The recall, described as a \u201cprecaution\u201d, comes after Mars withdrew products in 55 countries last year. The risk of salmonella affects batches of products with best before dates in May 2018 but not other Mars products, according to the confectionery firm. Mars said it discovered the risk on Thursday night after testing at a laboratory in its headquarters at Slough. A Mars official could not say how long the products had been on the shelves in the UK and Ireland. The affected products are Galaxy Milk 200g bars, Galaxy Milk 42g bars and multipacks, Galaxy Counters 78g treat bags and112g pouches, and Maltesers Teasers 35g bars. The recall also affects 118g pouches of Minstrels sold as part of Mars\u2019 \u201cSweet Nights In\u201d promotion. Mars said: \u201cThrough our routine testing, we have detected the potential presence of salmonella from the ingredients used to make our chocolate. \u201cAs a precaution, we are voluntarily recalling certain Galaxy Smooth Milk chocolate bars, Galaxy Minstrels and Galaxy Counters and Teaser bars. We are working closely with the relevant food safety authorities and our customers to ensure that the affected products are no longer available for purchase. \u201cIf you have one of the products listed above, you should not eat it. Please keep the product and contact our consumer care team to arrange return and reimbursement. \u201cThis precautionary recall has been initiated with the best interests of our consumers at heart and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused. \u201cNo other brands or varieties of chocolate, pack formats, bar sizes or best before dates are affected. Mars said concerned customers in the UK could call 0800 952 0084 or contact the company via its website, while customers in Ireland can ring 1890 812 315 or email a separate address. The Food Standards Agency said: \u201cIf you have bought any of the above products do not eat them.\u201d \u201cSymptoms caused by salmonella usually include fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps,\u201d the FSA warned. \u201cThe FSA is working with the food business and its local authority to identify the source of the problem,\u201d it added. Mars was forced to issue a much larger recall in February 2016 after a customer in Germany found pieces of plastic in a Snickers bar. As part of the recall, the company warned chocolate lovers in 55 countries of the risk to products including funsize Milky Way and Mars bars, as well as boxes of Celebrations. In 2007, Mars recalled packs of Maltesers and Revels after a problem on its Slough production line led to pieces of rubber being found in the chocolate. One of the most serious incidents to affect the company involved the Animal Liberation Front claim in 1984 that it had injected Mars bars throughout the country with rat poison. The animal rights group later admitted the claim was a hoax aimed at hurting Mars\u2019 sales, over claims that it backed using animals for tooth decay research. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2017. An earlier version said that Mars withdrew products in 55 countries earlier this year. That happened in February 2016.",

A Mars official could not say how long the products had been on the shelves in the UK and Ireland. </p> <p>The affected products are Galaxy Milk 200g bars, Galaxy Milk 42g bars and multipacks, Galaxy Counters 78g treat bags and112g pouches, and Maltesers Teasers 35g bars.</p> <p>The recall also affects 118g pouches of Minstrels sold as part of Mars\u2019 \u201cSweet Nights In\u201d promotion.</p> <p>Mars said: \u201cThrough our routine testing, we have detected the potential presence of salmonella from the ingredients used to make our chocolate. </p> <p>\u201cAs a precaution, we are voluntarily recalling certain Galaxy Smooth Milk chocolate bars, Galaxy Minstrels and Galaxy Counters and Teaser bars. We are working closely with the relevant food safety authorities and our customers to ensure that the affected products are no longer available for purchase.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have one of the products listed above, you should not eat it. Please keep the product and contact our consumer care team to arrange return and reimbursement.</p> <p>\u201cThis precautionary recall has been initiated with the best interests of our consumers at heart and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused. </p> <p>\u201cNo other brands or varieties of chocolate, pack formats, bar sizes or best before dates are affected.<br></p> <p>Mars said concerned customers in the UK could call 0800 952 0084 or <a href=\"http://www.mars.co.uk/contact\">contact the company via its website</a>, while customers in Ireland can ring 1890 812 315 or <a href=\"http://www.mars.ie/contact\">email a separate address</a>.</p> <p>The Food Standards Agency said: \u201cIf you have bought any of the above products do not eat them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSymptoms caused by salmonella usually include fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps,\u201d the FSA warned.</p> <p>\u201cThe FSA is working with the food business and its local authority to identify the source of the problem,\u201d it added.</p> <p>Mars was forced to issue a much larger recall in February 2016 after a customer in Germany found pieces of plastic in a Snickers bar. As part of the recall, the company warned chocolate lovers in 55 countries of the risk to products including funsize Milky Way and Mars bars, as well as boxes of Celebrations.</p> <p>In 2007, Mars recalled packs of Maltesers and Revels after a problem on its Slough production line led to pieces of rubber being found in the chocolate.</p> <p>One of the most serious incidents to affect the company involved the Animal Liberation Front claim in 1984 that it had injected Mars bars throughout the country with rat poison. The animal rights group later admitted the claim was a hoax aimed at hurting Mars\u2019 sales, over claims that it backed using animals for tooth decay research.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2017. An earlier version said that Mars withdrew products in 55 countries earlier this year. That happened in February 2016.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The pound slumped and shares in major banks, housebuilders and construction companies tumbled after the shock election result raised questions over the pace of Brexit talks and prospects for the UK economy. Sterling fell 2% to $1.2670 while shares in Lloyds Banking Group were down, along with those in Royal Bank of Scotland and the housebuilders Barratt and Taylor Wimpey. Shares in the fashion retailer Next were also lower on fears that consumer confidence would take a knock. But with the pound at its lowest level since since Theresa May called the snap election on 18 April, the FTSE 100 was pulled higher as the international companies that dominate the blue chip index stand to benefit from weakness in sterling. The City was wrongfooted by the election result, which was expected to return an increased majority for May rather than the hung parliament declared just before the London markets opened. The first clues came in an exit poll that stunned traders when it was published at 10pm on Thursday, described by Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, as a \u201cthunderbolt\u201d. \u201cBritain\u2019s inconclusive election means it is a question of when, not if, the country heads to the polls again in the near future,\u201d said Tombs. All eyes were on the pound, which has been the focus of City attention since the vote for Brexit a year ago, amid warnings that a hung parliament could drive the currency lower. While sterling\u2019s weakness pulled up the FTSE 100, which gained around 40 points, or 0.5%, it failed to cushion the domestically focused FTSE 250, which fell by almost 1%, or 180 points. For analysts at UBS there were concerns about the impact of the election result on the economy. \u201cSuch significant political uncertainty will further dampen sentiment and confidence, exacerbating the weakness we have already been starting to see over recent months,\u201d the UBS analysts said. A debate was also raging on City dealing floors about whether the election outcome was more likely to lead to a soft Brexit, with the UK able to retain access to the single market, and whether talks would start as planned later this month. Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg, said: \u201cMarkets might perceive the near-term uncertainty to be worse than it was after the Brexit vote. However, if a hung parliament forces a cross-party compromise, it could lead to a softer Brexit strategy, and may turn out to be positive in the long run after some serious initial confusion.\u201d But, he added: \u201cThe UK gets weak and wobbly government at the worst possible time, that is, when it has to renegotiate its position in Europe and the world. The Brexit clock is ticking ... Until parliament gets its act together the UK will be in no position to start serious Brexit talks on 19 June. After the UK wasted the first three months of the two-year divorce period, why should the EU agree to extend the deadline?\u201d The employers\u2019 body, the CBI, immediately called on the politicians to keep the political wrangling to a minimum. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said: \u201cThis is a serious moment for the UK economy. The priority must be for politicians to get their house in order and form a functioning government, reassure the markets and protect our resilient economy.\u201d The pound\u2019s slide had been signalled from the moment the shock 10pm exit poll was published, when it dived 2% almost instantly. But it stabilised through the night while dealers tried to gauge the accuracy of the exit polls. By the time trading began in London hours, it was clear that a hung parliament was inevitable. Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at World First, said sterling was moving as each seat was called through the night, with the currency staging brief recoveries every time it looked as if the poll had overemphasised Conservative weakness in the polls. \u201cIt is fair to say that the political uncertainty in the UK is rising again and thus might have implications for financial investments,\u201d said Christoph Riniker, the head of equity strategy research at Julius Baer. But while the UK market was focused on the uncertainty created by the outcome of the election, analysts at the financial firm IG noted that other markets were calm. Traditional safe havens such as gold and the yen were lower. \u201cIt\u2019s something that felt like something of catastrophe \u2026 but no one seems to care apart from the UK,\u201d said Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG.",

    "webTitle": "Willie Walsh: 'I think some of the criticism of BA has been unfair'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The frustrating thing for Willie Walsh is that, outside the airline industry, many people still think he is the direct boss of British Airways. In fact, he is the chief executive of IAG \u2013 its parent company \u2013 and the man who can sack the boss of BA. But, despite mounting public opinion, he is not minded to do so ... yet. It has been a busy couple of weeks for Walsh, since the bank holiday weekend meltdown of BA\u2019s computer systems \u2013 evidently the result of a slip by a technician \u2013 that left planes grounded and tens of thousands of passengers\u2019 holiday plans in tatters. The debacle\u2019s enduring image was of crowds of would-be travellers stuck in Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 5, with airline staff clueless what to advise \u2013 later compounded by the widespread loss of luggage and mealy-mouthed discussions of compensation. A void of information was filled by commentary on the decline of BA \u2013 and questions over whether years of cost-cutting was to blame. How bad a week was it? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a week,\u201d says Walsh swiftly. \u201cThe thing you\u2019ve got to recognise is that BA was back to normal pretty quickly. The critical thing was to get moving again and get customers looked after. I think some of the criticism has been unfair \u2013 but it\u2019s easy for me to say that.\u201d Unions point to hundreds of redundancies in the airline\u2019s IT department, where jobs had been outsourced to India. Walsh, however, says that is opportunistic nonsense: \u201cIt\u2019s to be expected, but it was completely misleading, it had nothing to do with it. To try to take advantage of customers\u2019 pain like that to pursue a different agenda is unfair.\u201d But BA\u2019s explanations \u2013 eventually boiling down to an individual flicking a power switch that they should not have touched \u2013 have failed to reassure. Walsh concedes, saying: \u201cPeople have struggled to understand some of it. The experts out there saying it was extremely rare and unusual questioned whether it happened at all. It did happen, and they\u2019re right: it is extremely rare and unusual.\u201d Some have queried whether there is a dearth of IT experience at the top of IAG, something Walsh immediately dismisses. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be an IT expert to understand how an uninterruptible power supply works. It\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d he says. Yet suspicion has been fuelled by years when BA has been relentlessly cutting costs, hitting everything from salaries to sandwiches. \u201cYou talk about it as cost-cutting, I talk about it as efficiency,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cIf you are to survive in an environment where average fares are declining, it drives you to be more efficient. There are times you\u2019ll get that wrong, or take decisions that are not liked by others. The idea that you would accept inefficiency \u2013 I just don\u2019t get it.\u201d So does he like the \u201cSlasher Walsh\u201d nickname? \u201cI\u2019ve heard lots of nicknames \u2013 none that I\u2019d ever use myself.\u201d He declines to list them. A strand of thought has emerged among analysts that BA has cut costs too far, risking customer loyalty by failing to maintain the demarcation between the flag carrier and its low-cost rivals. Walsh is unapologetic, saying that \u201cbrands need to adapt\u201d \u2013 as he first demonstrated while forcing through changes at the helm of Ireland\u2019s national carrier. \u201cThe brand values that Aer Lingus had back in the late 1990s were putting the airline out of business.\u201d He says the core values of BA\u2019s \u201cresilient\u201d brand need to be retained and protected, although he only identifies one, of being a British airline. \u201cBritishness is absolutely critical, it works extremely well, particularly outside the UK. But we\u2019ve got to be relevant in the market, to provide services to customers at a price they\u2019re prepared to pay. If you look at easyJet and Ryanair and their growth, they\u2019ve clearly done something that\u2019s more relevant than what we did.\u201d BA could not survive, he argues, had it carried on doing what it was: \u201cAll brands need to adapt.\u201d Millennials, Walsh contends, pose a huge challenge for a brand like BA. In the days after the IT meltdown, he had his hands full with a new venture to try to reach that younger, cash-strapped market: a low-cost, long-haul airline within IAG called Level, launching its first flight out of Barcelona to Los Angeles. Walsh then flew straight on to Mexico to take up his duties as chairman of Iata, the global airline body, holding its annual summit meeting. Even had he not been occupied elsewhere, Walsh says, he could not have got involved in BA\u2019s crisis response because the safety regulator has to know that an airline\u2019s accountable manager is making decisions, and not second-guessing \u2013 or being overruled by \u2013 his boss. \u201cIn this situation I think Alex did a good job,\u201d he says of BA\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, then adds: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say maybe I would have done things differently, but then I\u2019m a different person.\u201d Should not Cruz have been visible in the terminal, as many have suggested, immediately apologising for the chaos and showing passengers he cared? \u201cThat might have satisfied some people, but I\u2019m not sure it would have contributed to getting BA back and running as quickly as it did,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cWhere there is a crisis and defined roles, you have to get on with the job you\u2019re required to do.\u201d Walsh once said he would retire at 55, a milestone he passed last year. Extreme weight loss in 2015 sparked questions about his health, but it was simply Walsh paring himself to the bone with the same rigour he applied to his airlines. \u201cWhen I realised I was putting on more weight than I wanted, I had to do something about it.\u201d The ensuing diet \u2013 cutting out frequent cappuccinos and Cokes \u2013 was partly inspired by a desire to stay fit to enjoy the next stage in life. \u201cA friend of mine in his 70s said his greatest regret was not retiring when he could do more. \u201cI\u2019ll move on. Tim Clark [the chief executive of Emirates] and I had a chat about this; he said he wants to visit some of the places he\u2019s been to. You travel the world and don\u2019t see anything. I\u2019m in Mexico, and what am I seeing? The inside of a hotel.\u201d Walsh will sail a boat he keeps on the Thames, but rules out an easy golfing retirement: \u201cThere\u2019s work I want to do, things I think I could get involved in.\u201d He grows animated talking about an \u201cincredibly powerful\u201d campaign launched by Iata to tackle human trafficking. What else keeps him awake at night? \u201cI sleep OK, to be honest with you. I tend not to worry about things that I can\u2019t control. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in this industry \u2013 if you were to sit there worrying about all the things that might happen, you\u2019d be a physical and mental wreck.\u201d In fact, he misses running the airline, he says, system meltdowns and all. \u201cI\u2019ve got to accept that the role I have now is different. When you appoint people to run the business you\u2019ve got to have confidence in them. Until,\u201d he adds ominously, \u201cthe time that maybe you don\u2019t \u2013 and then you deal with that.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The co-founder of Boohoo.com has cashed in on the fast-growing popularity of the online fashion group by selling more than \u00a380m in shares. Mahmud Kamani and his siblings Rabia Kamani and Nurez Kamani sold a total of 36.6m shares. The Manchester-based retailer also raised \u00a350m through the placing of 22.7m new shares priced at 220p. The shares hit a record high \u2013 closing up 18% at 260p on Thursday \u2013 after Boohoo said the money raised from the sale of new shares would be used to pay for a \u201csupersite\u201d warehouse, as the retailer attempts to meet rising demand for its clothing ranges, aimed at 16- to 30-year-olds. The company, which sells dresses priced from \u00a34 to \u00a350 and jeans ranging from \u00a36 to \u00a335, is valued at about \u00a32.8bn \u2013 four times as much as Debenhams. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: \u201cIt says something about the extraordinary outlook for the business that all the shares have been snapped up at 220p, a minimal 0.3% discount to the closing price [on Wednesday].\u201d It left the Kamani family, together with co-founder Carol Kane, with a 39% stake in the business, which also includes the brands Pretty Little Thing and Nasty Gal. George Mensah, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cWe have no concerns about the possibility of the most senior member of management selling down equity, we believe this to be opportunistic \u2026 and we believe both chief executives to be committed to the long-term future of the business.\u201d The retailer exceeded expectations for first-quarter sales, which more than doubled to \u00a3120m in the three months to 31 May. Boohoo also raised its guidance for full-year sales growth to 60%, from an earlier forecast of 50%. The shares were floated at 50p three years ago and fell to 23p in the first year, but over the past 12 months they have risen more than 300%. Mahmud Kamani and Kane, joint chief executives, said the business had performed well across all brands and locations in the first quarter. \u201cThe combination of broadening product ranges, strong brand image, competitive prices and good customer service continues to drive sales momentum, while the inclusion of our new brands is proving the potential of our multi-brand strategy in delivering strong group revenue growth,\u201d they said. Warehouse expansion plans include an automated distribution centre to provide \u00a32bn in annual sales capacity, on top of the \u00a31bn provided by its extended site in Burnley. The cost of the land and construction of the warehouse is expected to cost about \u00a3150m over the next three years. A spokesperson for the company said Boohoo had yet to decide on a location for the 600,000 sq ft facility. The upbeat outlook from Boohoo was in sharp contrast to the fortunes of its rival Topshop, part of Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire, where UK sales fell for the first time in more than a decade. It also came despite a challenging backdrop for consumers, as prices rose faster than wages. Boohoo was founded in Manchester in 2006 targeting young, cost-conscious customers. The average item of clothing on the website is \u00a313. The company bought a 66% stake in Pretty Little Thing, which aims to \u201cmake every girl feel like a celebrity\u201d, in January. It bought US-based Nasty Gal, which targets 18- to 27-year-olds, a month later.",

Al Faisal Holding, a Qatari conglomerate with interests ranging from hotels to transport, was cited as a bidder for the hedge fund-owned bank in a deal being co-ordinated by Interritus. The Co-op Bank put itself up for sale in February, hoping to attract interest in a business that has 4m customers and an avowedly ethical stance. The bank has been seeking a long-term solution to its future since 2013 when it was discovered that the bank \u2013 then 100% owned by the Co-operative Group of supermarkets and funeral homes \u2013 needed \u00a31.5bn to keep afloat. Its financial difficulties were followed by revelations about its former chairman Paul Flowers who was later fined for possessing cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine and was dismissed as a minister by the Methodist church earlier this year. In 2013, the bank found the capital it needed in a rescue deal led by hedge funds, who will now be influential in determining the outcome of any discussions with potential bidders. The City believes the most likely outcome to the bank\u2019s latest fundraising exercise will involve hedge funds stumping up the cash, as part of a transaction involving the bank\u2019s bond holders and issuing new shares. The Co-op Bank has already warned bondholders that potential bidders have sought \u201csome form of liability management exercise\u201d \u2013 which could require investors taking losses in return for equity stakes. An April, the City was told the bank had \u201creceived a number of non-binding proposals from strategic and financial parties\u201d. Lenders such as Virgin Money were originally considered potential bidders. In March the bank reported a loss of \u00a3477m, which took its cumulative losses to \u00a32.6bn and forced the business to announce more branch closures that would reduce its estate to 95, around 200 less than five years ago. Interritus is an investment firm that owns a stake in Austrian bank Kommunalkredit and was founded by a former senior Deutsche Bank employee, Patrick Bettscheider.",

      "bodyText": "When it closed for business on election day, the City of London was in confident mood. Theresa May was Margaret Thatcher. Jeremy Corbyn was Michael Foot. Labour\u2019s manifesto was, if not the longest suicide note in history, the second longest. Opinion polls were pointing to a Tory majority of about 100, which is what Thatcher got in her second general election victory. By 10pm when the results of the exit poll were released, it dawned on the City that this was not a rerun of 1983 but of 1974. May was not Thatcher, she was Ted Heath, a prime minister lacking the human touch who had called an election when there was no need to do so. With a hung parliament pointing to the possibility of a second general election within months \u2013 another echo of 1974 \u2013 the markets responded in predictable fashion by dumping the pound. The City hates uncertainty but it has now got uncertainty in spades. Brexit talks are supposed to start the week after next and it is uncertain whether May will still be leading the team by then. May\u2019s plan to strengthen her hand in the negotiations by increasing her majority has been an abysmal failure. There are now obvious and serious questions being asked about what the final deal will look like and whether the article 50 talks can be completed within the two-year deadline. Unsurprisingly, the CBI expressed concern at an outcome that is bound to make business warier about investing. Life is only going to get more difficult for the Conservatives, assuming that they manage to cling on to power as a minority government. One reason May lost rather than won seats was that the country has had enough of austerity and is fed up with working ever harder for little reward. Political history suggests that sitting governments tend to do well when living standards are rising \u2013 as they were in 2015 - and badly when they are falling. On that basis, this was a supremely daft time to hold an election, because prices are going up more quickly than wages, which are still lower in real terms than they were seven years ago. Far from helping the Conservatives, the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London merely served to make voters wonder about the wisdom of cuts in police budgets in an attempt to hit deficit-reduction targets that have not been met. Certain things are clear despite the fog of uncertainty. First, the idea of balancing the budget has retreated further into the distance. A minority government will be looking to hand out goodies to the voters rather than squeeze them further. Second, the fall in the value of the pound will intensify the squeeze on living standards, making it even more likely that there will be soft-pedalling on austerity. Third, Philip Hammond is safe in his job because May is not strong enough to sack him. Finally, the prospect of a Brexit deal under which the UK stays in the single market has increased.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest revelations about behaviour at Uber are the most shocking in a long series. A senior executive obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India, it is reported. He was apparently motivated to invade her privacy because Uber executives had somehow convinced themselves that the rape case \u2013 for which the driver was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment \u2013 was related to a conspiracy by Ola, the company\u2019s big rival in India, to damage the US firm. There is no evidence to support the theory that Ola was somehow involved. If common sense, not to mention common decency, seems entirely absent at Uber, so does any vague understanding of good corporate governance. The executive in question \u2013 Eric Alexander, president of Uber Asia Pacific \u2013 was dismissed this week only after journalists from the Recode website made inquiries. According to the New York Times\u2019 sources, Alexander had shared and discussed the woman\u2019s medical records with Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s founder and chief executive, and senior vice-president Emil Michael. If this incident was isolated, it would still be inexcusable. But complaints about misconduct at Uber have come so thick and fast that the company was obliged to order two independent inquiries. The first report on sexual harassment, conducted by law firm Perkins Coie, led to 20 employees being dismissed. The findings of a second inquiry on Uber\u2019s wider culture, led by former US attorney general Eric Holder, are due to be announced next week. Through all the scandals, including allegations that Uber used secret software to fool law enforcement officers, supposedly independent directors such as Arianna Huffington, the most visible, have stood by Kalanick. That was true even when he admitted he needed \u201cleadership help\u201d after being filmed ranting at one of Uber\u2019s drivers. Uber is privately owned and Kalanick seems to have vice-like control of the shares. But, in any well-run public company, he would have been shown the door. If Uber intends to launch a public offering and join a US stock market, it will surely require an entirely new board.",

      "body": "<p>The latest revelations about behaviour at Uber are the most shocking in a long series. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/07/uber-executive-fired-eric-alexander-rape-case-india\">A senior executive obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India,</a> it is reported. He was apparently motivated to invade her privacy because Uber executives had somehow convinced themselves that the rape case \u2013 for which the driver was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment \u2013 was related to a conspiracy by Ola, the company\u2019s big rival in India, to damage the US firm. There is no evidence to support the theory that Ola was somehow involved.</p> <p>If common sense, not to mention common decency, seems entirely absent at Uber, so does any vague understanding of good corporate governance. The executive in question \u2013 Eric Alexander, president of Uber Asia Pacific \u2013 was dismissed this week only after journalists from the Recode website made inquiries. According to the New York Times\u2019 sources, Alexander had shared and discussed the woman\u2019s medical records with Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s founder and chief executive, and senior vice-president Emil Michael.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/08/uber-executive-had-no-reason-to-obtain-victims-medical-records-says-police-official\">Uber executive had no reason to obtain rape victim's medical records, says police official</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If this incident was isolated, it would still be inexcusable. But complaints about misconduct at Uber have come so thick and fast that the company was obliged to order two independent inquiries. The first report on sexual harassment, conducted by law firm Perkins Coie, led to 20 employees being dismissed. The findings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/21/uber-hires-eric-holder-to-investigate-sexual-harassment-allegations\">a second inquiry on Uber\u2019s wider culture</a>, led by former US attorney general Eric Holder, are due to be announced next week.</p> <p>Through all the scandals, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/03/uber-secret-program-greyball-resignation-ed-baker\">allegations that Uber used secret software to fool law enforcement officers</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/21/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-defense-arianna-huffington-executives\"> supposedly independent directors such as Arianna Huffington, the most visible, have stood by Kalanick</a>. That was true even when he admitted he needed \u201cleadership help\u201d after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/28/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-driver-argument-video-fare-prices\">being filmed ranting at one of Uber\u2019s drivers</a>.</p> <p>Uber is privately owned and Kalanick seems to have vice-like control of the shares. But, in any well-run public company, he would have been shown the door. If Uber intends to launch a public offering and join a US stock market, it will surely require an entirely new board.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The shock election result sent the pound plunging amid fears that Brexit negotiations could be delayed if voters returned a hung parliament to Westminster. The pound immediately dropped in reaction to the shock 10pm exit poll, falling as much as 2% to $1.27 in the currency markets, its lowest level in six weeks. It was projected the Conservatives would become the largest party but fall short of the 326 seats required for a majority. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, described the exit poll as a \u201cthunderbolt\u201d, reflecting shock across the City, where dealers had begun the evening expecting a clear majority for the Conservatives. The pound remained under pressure but analysts at financial firm IG said the futures markets were predicting the FTSE 100 index would open just 13 points lower, cushioned in part by the fall in sterling, which benefits the international companies in the index. The stock market had fallen 0.38% to 7449 on Thursday, before the exit poll was published. While investors were surprised when May called the election on 18 April, with the FTSE 100 suffering its biggest fall since the vote for Brexit, the Tories were expected to win convincingly. But the exit poll showed that would not be case. During the night the currency regained some of the lost ground as the first results came in and traders stationed at their desks across the City calculated that the exit poll was overstating the Conservatives\u2019 losses. But as the night wore on, the exit poll proved to be more correct than originally thought. Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at World First, said sterling was moving as each seat was called and at 1.30am, it reached a new low for the session of $1.2696, as sentiment shifted back towards the exit poll presenting a true picture. Cook saidsterling could fall to $1.24. This figure would, however, not be as low as the levels it plunged to after the Brexit vote almost a year ago. \u201cCurrencies like governments with mandates \u2013 and don\u2019t like delays to Brexit,\u201d Cook said. Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at MUFG, also warned the pound was vulnerable. \u201cThe market will be praying that this exit poll has got it wrong. Currency volatility is the best proxy for market fears; if the Conservative ship is sinking, then the market will be looking for a lifeboat,\u201d he said. Late on Thursday night, Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg, agreed: \u201cIf the exit polls are right, tomorrow will be interesting, to put it mildly.\u201d The City was focused on the fear that fresh political uncertainty could delay Brexit negotiations. Kit Juckes, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: \u201cThere will be other polls, and results will come out through the night, but this is going to leave Theresa May struggling to keep control of the Brexit process.\u201d Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Wealth Management, said: \u201cIt is early days, and the result can change, but it looks as though Theresa May\u2019s grip over the Conservative party has weakened, which does not bode well for the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.\u201d There was uncertainty about whether the election result could lead to a softer Brexit. Pickering said: \u201cMarkets might perceive the near-term uncertainty to be worse than it was after the Brexit vote. However, if a hung parliament forces a cross-party compromise, it could lead to a softer Brexit strategy, and may turn out to be positive in the long run after some serious initial confusion.\u201d While London dealers waited for the stock market to open, Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at IG, said: \u201cThe shock of the result is not really translated into the market.\u201d The loss of seats by the Scottish National party reducing pressure for Scottish independence was one potential reason, as was the prospect of a softer Brexit. The Confederation of British Industry was quick to say any new government should start to refocus on the economy, which, according to official statistics, was the worst performer in the EU in the opening months of 2017 as the Brexit vote started to take its toll. \u201cAs a nation, we have the creativity, skills and global outlook to make the UK a true world leader in the industries of the future, bringing jobs and growth to all parts of the UK,\u201d said Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the employers\u2019 body. \u201cAs early priorities, business will want to see a commitment to tax and regulatory stability, fast progress on a modern industrial strategy to support skills, infrastructure and innovation, and a Brexit approach that puts people and trade ahead of politics.\u201d",
