      "bodyText": "Britain is home to 840,000 people who are dollar millionaires with \u00a3660,000 or more excluding their main home \u2013 a combined wealth of $3.5tn (\u00a32.3tn). The number of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs owning at least $1m) declined by 1.2% from the end of 2007 to the end of 2013 as financial crisis turned to recession, but it is now expected to reach 1 million in the next three years, the report by New World Wealth said. Falling equity and property prices over the six years cut the total number of HNWIs by about 10,000, although the number of billionaires and those with $100m or more increased as rich people from abroad came to Britain. \u201cThis decline would have been far greater had it not been for the migration of a large number of wealthy individuals into the UK during the period,\u201d said the report. \u201cWe estimate that over 30,000 HNWIs moved to the UK during the review period. The bulk \u2026 came from the EU, Asia and the Middle East. Most of them settled in London and south-east England.\u201d While HNWIs\u2019 total wealth declined between 2007 to 2013 by 0.9%, UK GDP per head fell much more steeply, losing 16%. The share of the UK\u2019s total wealth owned by HNWIs is now 38%, compared with the worldwide average of 34%. London is home to most of Britain\u2019s wealthy, with 376,600 HNWI residents, or 44.8% of the UK total. But despite London\u2019s status as a haven for the world\u2019s wealthy, Edinburgh, Scotland\u2019s financial centre, has a higher concentration of HNWIs than the capital. HNWIs make up 5.8% of Edinburgh residents, compared with 4.5% for London and Manchester. London and the south-east\u2019s dominance of the nation\u2019s wealth is underlined by rankings for the top counties for millionaires. The capital and surrounding counties such as Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire make up seven of the top 10, with Greater Manchester, Edinburgh and Lancashire the others. The home counties include nine of the top 10 small towns for millionaires. The top three are Windsor in Berkshire, Weybridge in Surrey and Sevenoaks in Kent. Hale in Greater Manchester was number 10 and Alderley Edge, Cheshire, was 11. Britain, including the Channel Islands, is the third biggest HNWI market in the world, behind the US and Japan. Real estate and construction is the main source of wealth for 18% of UK HNWIs, ahead of financial services (15%), retail (10%) and media (9%). So-called core millionaires, with assets of up to $30m (\u00a320m), make up 64% of UK HNWI wealth. The number of \u201cultra-high-net-worth individuals\u201d, with assets of $30m or more, fell 0.2% from 2007 to 2013, but the number of billionaires rose by a third, to 102. Those with $100m or more increased by 8%. The years since the financial crisis have been marked by rich people from abroad buying property in the UK for investment or basing themselves in London. Rich foreigners helped fuel a 30% increase, to $15bn, in spending on luxury goods such as cars, clothing and hotels from 2007 to 2013, more than offsetting the decline in overall HNWI numbers.",

      "bodyText": "In a speech that delicately avoided mention of Greece or Germany, Mark Carney summed up what is wrong with the eurozone: it is in a debt trap and escape is only possible if its members start sharing some risks. The governor of the Bank of England is surely correct on the facts. Low growth is adding to the debt burden. Fear of stagnation is holding back investment. Quantitative easing, though welcome, can\u2019t eliminate risks. Too many countries are trying to improve their competitiveness against each other, doing little to improve aggregate demand. \u201cIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, if the eurozone were a country, fiscal policy would be substantially more supportive,\u201d said Carney. Effective currency unions like the US, he argued, have centralised authorities whose spending is at least a quarter of GDP. Such a system dampens localised shocks and keeps capital flowing to where it is needed. So far, so uncontroversial: it is no longer news that monetary union without fiscal union was a terrible idea. But the interesting part was where Carney described options for sharing risks and pursuing fiscal integration. How about \u201ca pooled employment insurance mechanism\u201d? In other words, a common policy for unemployment benefits, funded by all members. On paper, it sounds very modest \u2013 a baby step towards a euro system where more risks are shared. How likely is it to happen, though? In the current climate, not at all: the politics are just too toxic. Consider Carney\u2019s speech an excellent prescription of how to start to solve the euro mess. It was almost uplifting. But will the patient take the advice? Maybe only after another lost decade. Songbird not so chirpy This bid is inadequate but you should accept it anyway. Welcome to the whacky world of Songbird Estates, 70% owner of the Canary Wharf estate. The board\u2019s resistance to the \u00a32.6bn offer from Qatar Investment Authority and Brookfield of Canada has crumbled. It turns out that the big shareholders, who are about half the board, didn\u2019t want to follow their own advice. It would have been wise to have discovered those shareholders\u2019 true feelings before chirping so loudly and confidently. Everybody on the Songbird perch looks a little silly, from chairman David Pritchard, to the big shareholders, to the flock of expensive advisers \u2013 Rothschild, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Cazenove. The cast of characters in this saga is long. But the short fact is that Simon Glick, China Investment Corporation and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds own about 50% of Songbird between them. They could have blocked the deal if they had stuck together. Was it a collective wobble or did somebody fall first? We\u2019ll never be told, though fingers will point at the Chinese as they are the only ones without a board position. Or maybe Simon Glick, the New York real estate tycoon, made a cold calculation: $1bn in cash for his slice of Songbird is not so terrible when the alternative is being stuck in a non-dividend-paying company with a labyrinthine ownership structure. Whatever it was, the board and its advisers were pushing their luck by parading 381p as Songbird\u2019s true net asset value if the big shareholders were inclined to take 350p. The bizarreness is demonstrated by the fact that Morgan Stanley property funds have ignored advice endorsed by Morgan Stanley. The fees will still have to be paid, of course. The Qataris, who already owned 28% of Songbird, have played a blinder. This was a rare instance of a sovereign wealth fund making a hostile \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d bid for a public company. They read the deep disunity in Songbird\u2019s ranks correctly. Barring an eleventh-hour counter-bid, they will add to their vast collection of London properties at a price that will probably be seen as representing decent long-term value when Crossrail arrives to offer 40-minute journeys from the Wharf to Heathrow. As for the Songbird board, capitulation was the only credible position to adopt after the main shareholders accepted the offer meekly \u2013 but the directors still look more dodo than nightingale. Os\u00f3rio talked up What\u2019s behind this flurry of stories that Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio, boss of Lloyds Banking Group, is the hot tip to be the next chief executive of Standard Chartered? Horta Os\u00f3rio would be a good catch, of course. But a cynic might suggest that it is helpful for Lloyds, at this hour, to have his talents talked up. The bank will soon pay \u00a37m to Horta Os\u00f3rio in the form of incentive rewards. The inevitable pre-election political storm would be easy to handle if Horta Os\u00f3rio is seen as a man who Lloyds must keep.",

      "bodyText": "British Airways is to make radical changes to its airmiles scheme used by millions of travellers - called Avios - which will slash by 75% the airmiles the cheapest economy class tickets will earn, while giving business and expense-account flyers more rewards. A basic economy-class ticket from London to New York will from 28 April earn just 865 airmiles, down from 3,458. Previously the number of points earned on a return flight across the Atlantic would have been enough to obtain a flight from London to Milan (plus a \u00a335 fee), but after the changes it will fall far short of any destination served by British Airways. Avios is one of the biggest airmiles programmes in the world, used by 6.4 million travellers, and the changes immediately sparked accusations that the airline has \u201cgutted\u201d the scheme. Among the worst hit will be UK travellers who live outside London and use connecting flights from regional airports to fly to other destinations in Europe. Currently someone flying from Glasgow to Madrid return, connecting via Heathrow, will pay 9,000 Avios points plus \u00a335. But from 28 April the number of points required will double. Business and first-class passengers are the big winners from the changes. Travellers who turn left when they board a plane and enjoy the flat bed experience will see their Avios points rise by as much as two-thirds, with the Heathrow to JFK traveller picking up 8,645 airmiles, up from 5,187, on a one-way flight. British Airways is also introducing peak and off peak pricing for reward flights, for periods such as Christmas or during the school summer holidays. For example, a single flight to Rome will cost 7,500 points in July but 6,500 points in January. BA said the new structure means that \u201cfor two thirds of the year you will require fewer Avios than now to fly on reward seats.\u201d However, when business travellers come to redeem their points, the number of Avios they have to spend will rise. For example, a business class flight from London to Sydney currently costs 100,000 Avios points, but this will rise to 125,000 at off-peak times and 150,000 at peak times. Travellers also have to pay taxes, fees and charges. To sweeten the changes, BA is promising to make half a million extra seats available for travellers trying to use their accumulated points. \u201cWe guarantee that more than 9m reward seats will be available on our flights, with a minimum of two Club World/Club Europe and four World Traveller/Euro Traveller reward seats on all British Airways operated flights that are offered for sale on ba.com,\u201d it said. On Twitter, flyers accused the airline of devaluing the scheme. BA said the new Avios scheme would be fairer, with more expensive tickets earning higher rewards. \u201cWe\u2019ll make earning Avios on flights more aligned to the cabin you fly in and the different types of fares within that cabin. In practice this means that if you pay for a flexible ticket you will earn more Avios than the lowest priced ticket in the same cabin.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has launched a strong attack on austerity in the eurozone as he warned that he single-currency area was caught in a debt trap that could cost it a second lost decade. Speaking in Dublin, Carney said the eurozone needed to ease its hardline budgetary policies and make rapid progress towards a fiscal union that would transfer resources from rich to poor countries. \u201cIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, if the eurozone were a country, fiscal policy would be substantially more supportive,\u201d the governor said. \u201cHowever, it is tighter than in the UK, even though Europe still lacks other effective risk-sharing mechanisms and is relatively inflexible.\u201d Carney\u2019s remarks come just three days after the election of the Syriza-led government in Greece presented a direct challenge to the austerity policies championed in the eurozone by Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel. While not mentioning any eurozone country by name, Carney made it clear that he thought the failure to complete the process of integration coupled with over-restrictive fiscal policies risked driving the 18-nation single currency area deeper into a debt trap. \u201cSince the financial crisis all major advanced economies have been in a debt trap where low growth deepens the burden of debt, prompting the private sector to cut spending further. Persistent economic weakness damages the extent to which economies can recover. Skills and capital atrophy. Workers become discouraged and leave the labour force. Prospects decline and the noose tightens. \u201cAs difficult as it has been, some countries, including the US and the UK, are now escaping this trap. Others in the euro area are sinking deeper.\u201d Since the start of the eurozone crisis more than five years ago, Europe\u2019s policy makers have been calling for the creation of a banking union and a fiscal union to stand alongside the monetary union that created the single currency. There have also been calls, from the European commission, the European Central Bank and individual governments for economic reforms to make the eurozone more competitive. Carney noted: \u201cAs of this evening, progress on structural reforms in the euro area remains uneven. Cross border risk sharing through the financial system has slid backwards. Europe\u2019s leaders do not currently foresee fiscal union as part of monetary union. Such timidity has costs.\u201d The governor added that there are four features of Britain\u2019s economic model that showed how to escape a debt trap: an integrated financial system that channelled savings into investment; fiscal policy that moved money around the UK and was flexible enough to allow budget deficits to rise during downturns; the economy was open and flexible; and the monetary policy operated by Threadneedle Street was credible. He contrasted the UK with the eurozone, where output unadjusted for inflation has increased by 5% in almost seven years and inflation excluding fuel and food prices has been below 1% for over a year. \u201cThis is potentially dangerous. Low nominal growth is intensifying the euro area\u2019s debt burden. The fear of stagnation is holding back spending and investment.\u201d Carney has been vocal in his support for the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to start buying government and commercial debt in its own version of the quantitative easing programmes, but said the Frankfurt-based central bank was unable alone to eliminate the threat of a prolonged stagnation. \u201cThese exist primarily because, in most respects, the current construction of the euro area is unfinished.\u201d The governor expressed scepticism about whether improving competitiveness through driving down costs \u2013 a process known as internal devaluation \u2013 would work. \u201cInternal devaluations simply reallocate demand within the currency union. They do not boost aggregate demand in the euro area as a whole. Put another way, since competitiveness is relative, a solution for some cannot be a solution for all.\u201d Carney said the eurozone\u2019s unemployment rate of 11.5% was more than double that of the UK, but its fiscal deficit \u2013 the gap between tax revenues and spending \u2013 was only half the size of the UK\u2019s. The eurozone, he said, should be using a \u201cconstructive\u201d fiscal policy to support demand and mitigate the \u201ctail risks of stagnation\u201d. He added: \u201cEurope needs a comprehensive, coherent plan to anchor expectations, build confidence and escape its debt trap.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight. A quick reminder of the main events.... In a dramatic start to his tenure in office, Greece\u2019s new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has begun unpicking the deeply unpopular austerity policies underpinning the debt-stricken country\u2019s bailout programme. After storming to power on Sunday, the leftwinger said there was no time to waste. \u201cWe will continue with our plan,\u201d he told his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the right to disappoint our voters.\u201d Full story: Alexis Tsipras begins rolling back Greek austerity policies In another busy day in Greece, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis vowed to end the mistakes of the past, help reboot Europe\u2019s economy, and rehire the sacked cleaners whose struggle symbolises the public battle against Greece\u2019s bailout terms. Blogpost: Helena Smith: Unforgettable scenes at finance ministry Other ministers also began unpicking the Age of Austerity, freezing plans to privatise state assets. Our earlier summary has full details Greece\u2019s stock market tumbled, with its banks suffering their worst day ever. Financial stocks slumped by a third, raising fears that they might be nationalised. Blogpost: Black day for Greek stock markets And tonight, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s took the first step towards cutting Greece\u2019s credit rating further into junk territory. It warned that Greece\u2019s credit-worthiness was at risk, and flagged up the danger of a bank run.... We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Thanks for reading, and for all the comments. GW The most important line in S&amp;P\u2019s statement on Greece is its comment about savers taking out their money from their banks.... Reuters is helpfully snapping the key points from S&amp;P\u2019s statement on Greece, released a couple of minutes ago: S&amp;P REVISES GREECE SOVEREIGN CREDIT OUTLOOK TO CREDITWATCH NEGATIVE FROM STABLE; CURRENT RATING IS B S&amp;P SAYS IF NEW GREECE GOVT FAILS TO STRIKE AGREEMENT WITH OFFICIAL CREDITORS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT, THIS WOULD WEAKEN GREECE\u2019S FUNDING POSITION S&amp;P SAYS COULD LOWER GREECE\u2019S RATINGS IF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EU, EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND STALL S&amp;P - \u201cIF NEW GREEK GOVERNMENT FAILS TO AGREE WITH OFFICIAL CREDITORS ON FURTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORT, WOULD FURTHER WEAKEN GREECE\u2019S CREDITWORTHINESS\u201d S&amp;P-GREECE\u2019S RATING REFLECTS SOME OF ECONOMIC,BUDGETARY POLICIES ADVOCATED BY NEWLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT INCOMPATIBLE WITH POLICY FRAMEWORK AGREED S&amp;P - \u201cVIEW RECENT ACCELERATED PACE OF DEPOSIT WITHDRAWALS FROM GREEK BANKS,CONCOMITANT INCREASE IN ECB FINANCING TO THE BANKS, AS A CREDIT CONCERN\u201d Late news.... Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has just threatened to cut Greece\u2019s credit rating. S&amp;P has revised the outlook on Greece\u2019s B rating to creditwatch negative, from stable. That\u2019s the first step towards a formal downgrade. Could Greece\u2019s banks be nationalised?! Renaissance Capital\u2019s Charles Robertsons reckons it\u2019s possible, if relations between Athens and its lenders flounder. Today\u2019s plunge sent the Greek stock market down to its slowest level since September 2012. That means it has lost all the gains since Mario Draghi vowed to do whatever it takes to save the euro. Turnover was brisk, as investors raced to sell stocks, driving the banking sector down by a shocking 30%. That\u2019s the biggest selloff in their history, according to the FT. Piraeus, the country\u2019s largest bank by assets, has now halved in value in the last month. In case you missed it, here\u2019s our profile of Greece\u2019s new finance minister -- the \u201caccidental economist\u201d who\u2019s unlikely to back down in a row with lenders: Yanis Varoufakis: maverick economist with Greece\u2019s fate in his hands Greek media are reporting that Alexis Tsipras will meet with his economics ministers shortly. They\u2019ll discuss strategies ahead of Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloom\u2019s visit on Friday. Just in: Athens stock market has plunged by over 9%, and the banking sector has seen a quarter of its value wiped out. That\u2019s an extraordinary selloff. Greece\u2019s new anti-austerity government has got down to work, and started to unpick the austerity programme that drove the country deep into recession. In another action-packed day in Athens, ministers have been racing to unwind the actions of their ousted predecessors.....and shares have been tumbling on the local stock exchange. 1) Prime minister Alexis Tsipras told his ministers that they must not let voters down. At their first cabinet meeting, he declared: We are coming in to radically change the way that policies and administration are conducted in this country.\u201d Tsipras insisted that Greece must renegotiate debt relief, but vowed to avoid a destructive clash with lenders. Photos are here. 2) Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis also pledged to end the mistakes of the past. At a dramatic press conference, he vowed to end austerity, and rehire sacked cleaners -- paid for by paying for fewer consultants. 3) The day began with ministers announcing that they were halting plans to sell stakes in Greece\u2019s biggest port, and its main electricity provider. Both sales were demanded by the Troika. 4) Greek bank stocks have slumped in value today, with some tumbling by a third of their value. Greek bonds have also been hit, driving up their yields painfully high. The main Athens market is down over 9% in late trading 5) Analysts predict a fierce battle between Athens and its lenders. Berenberg bank suggests there is a 35% chance that Greece will quit the eurozone. The sacked finance ministry cleaners are delighted to have won their jobs back (as finance minister Varoufakis pledged at his handover ceremony) . Helena Smith reports: Katerina Capodistrias, one of the dozens who have daily camped outside the finance ministry to press demands for reinstatement. \u201cYanis Varoufakis is a star, a great economist and even better from Crete. We love him...He\u2019s the best choice for the post of finance minister.\u201d Despoina Kostopoulou, the cleaners\u2019 unofficial spokeswoman, said as far as she knew ALL of the cleaners would be rehired. \u201cWe are ecstatic,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe are now just waiting for the decision to be made, officially. We want to see it, and our names in it, with our own eyes. This is out 268th day outside the ministry but we have spent over a year and a half protesting on the streets. I expect that we will be here in the tents for a couple more days.\u201d Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s first ever press conference at the finance minister was quite an event. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: As hand-overs of government posts go, today\u2019s at the finance ministry will remain indelible in the minds of those who were there. Pained, raucous and joyful (with lots of spontaneous applause), it brought home in every way that this was a changing of guard \u2013 a turning not of the page but a book \u2013 in the country at the centre of the debt crisis. Out went the old era and in came the new, the besuited Gikas Hardouvelis looking both relieved and alarmed as he passed the chair to Yanis Varoufakis, his successor in trendy jacket and open-necked shirt. \u201cI sincerely wish the [new] government well,\u201d said Hardouvelis, eyes fixed firmly ahead, adding; \u201cGreece doesn\u2019t have the luxury of waiting to June to conclude the review of its programme with our partners.\u201d And then Varoufakis was off, rocking and rolling his way through Hardouvelis\u2019 script, demolishing the philosophy of a government that had, he said, thrown Greece into a self-perpetuating economic death spiral as a result of \u201cthe huge toxic mistake that had been made in this very building.\u201d Greece had no intention of clashing with its creditors but the logic of austerity was such that policies conducted in its embrace could only fail. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be an economist to see that,\u201d he said as some of those in the room (ministry staff perhaps?) began to clap. \u201cToday the denial of the problem is over, we are determined to change the logic [behind] the problem.\u201d At some point Hardouvelis, slumped in his chair, his deputy Christos Staikouras seated to his right, and now looking anything but happy, began to drum his fingers. An expression of disbelief flashed across his face as Varoufakis, all guns blazing, declared that the ministry would clamp down on expensive advisers and re-hire the cleaners that had become the face of austerity\u2019s injustice (much applause there) (and outside) that it would seek a Pan European New Deal to \u201creboot\u201d the economies not only of Greece but the continent at large, that under the radical leftists Athens would build a relationship \u201cof friendship and sincerity\u201d with Europe. And then it was over. Varoufakis, hugging Hardouvelis and kissing him on both cheeks (to Hardouvelis\u2019s somewhat dazed amazement) was out of his chair and off to begin \u201cthe hard work .\u201d HS Another symbolic moment: The railings that have \u201cprotected\u201d Greek MPs from the public are being removed today, reports Yannis Karagiorgas of Euronews. Photo of the day? It\u2019s the cleaning staff who lost their jobs at the Greek finance ministry as part of its austerity programme -- they applauded as they watched Yanis Varoufakis announce they would be rehired. Such a relief to see then smiling, after many months of tireless protests The rout is turning into a crash: Alexis Tsipras has spooked the Athens market, and holders of Greek bonds, by his early moves as PM, says Felix Herrmann, a market strategist at DZ Bank. Herrmann told Reuters: Tsipras has announced his new cabinet and his new finance minister seems to be a rough guy from the very far left of the political spectrum,\u201d \u201cThis is raising fears that there\u2019s a clash coming up between Athens and its lenders. The fact that he joined a coalition with the far right is not helping either.\u201d That\u2019s the Independent Greeks, with whom Syriza have virtually no common ground apart from their shared determination to end the current Greek bailout terms. Over in Berlin, Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman has told reporters that the chancellor expects to hear Greece\u2019s new economic strategy soon..... ....and despite the new Greek government\u2019s pledge to renegotiate its debts, Germany expects (or hopes?) Greece will stick to its obligations. Steffen Seibert said: \u201cI expect, as do all European partners, that the new Greek government will present its overarching economic and financial strategy imminently, and its clear ideas on how things proceed regarding the continuation of the current programme and how to fulfil Greece\u2019s obligations,\u201d \u201cIt will then be for European partners to discuss matters on the basis of these concrete suggestions,\u201d Back to finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s press conference... and he reveals he\u2019s going to visit his counterparts in France (Michel Sapin) and Italy (Pier Carlo Padoan) soon. No mention of a trip to Berlin, though..... The Athens stock market may be falling out of bed, but outside life continues as normal, reports crisis-watcher @teacherdude . Varoufakis says that he is planning to cut costs at the finance ministry by cutting the number of advisers. And he\u2019s also planning to rehire the ministry cleaners who have been fighting a legal battle since they lost their jobs. Those ladies came to symbolise Greece\u2019s battle against its creditors, spending months protesting outside government buildings. Finance minister Varoufakis insists that Greece will seek a new deal with its creditors..... Breaking: Greece\u2019s new finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, is giving a press conference in the finance ministry. Varoufakis is saying that Greece is \u201cturning a page on the mistake of the bailout\u201d. He also reveals that he\u2019s spoken to Jeroen Dijsselbloom, who hopes to find some common ground GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS SAYS TOLD EUROGROUP CHIEF WANTED A NEW AGREEMENT WITH LENDERS THAT EXITS BAILOUT LOGIC GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS SAYS WAS TOLD BY EUROGROUP CHIEF THAT COMMON GROUND CAN BE FOUND THROUGH DIALOGUE He\u2019s sitting alongside the former finance minister, Gikas Hardouvelis, who has warned that Greece faces \u201cacute financing needs in March\u201d. Yanis Varoufakis, the new Greek finance minister, in defiant mood. Not about austerity this time, but his blog. Writing in his personal blog, he vowed to continue posting his thoughts, defying those who consider it \u201cirresponsible for a finance minister to indulge in such crass forms of communication\u201d. Varoufakis conceded that his blog posts would be more infrequent and shorter from now on, but that he hoped to compensate his readers with juicier insights and comments. He wrote: For hope to be revived we must all strive to change the ways of a dismal past. Maintaining an open line with the outside world may be a small step in that direction. So, keep watching this space! You will find his blog here. AM Greek shares continue to fall sharply, led by the banks. Addressing his first cabinet meeting, Alexis Tsipras said the first priority of his government would be to address Greece\u2019s humanitarian crisis. The people demand we bleed in order to defend its dignity. Reuters is reporting that Giorgos Katrougalos, alternate minister for administrative reform, said some planned public sector job cuts would not go ahead. Those cuts that are against the constitution and those that have not gone through any evaluation will be cancelled, he said. AM Holger Schmieding, chief economist at German bank Berenberg has recently returned from Athens and is fired up over the situation in Greece. Just back from Athens, I feel almost compelled to shout it from the rooftops: it\u2019s not about the debt. it\u2019s about the economy, stupid - to borrow a phrase from Bill Clinton. In Athens, much of the discussions I had revolved around the debt: how much will Europe cut the burden now that Greek voters have asked for it? Or: wouldn\u2019t it be cheaper for Europe to write off half its claims on Greece than to risk losing it all? The new Greek government and its voters are in for a reality shock. The debate in Athens seems to suffer from four delusions. My best bet remains that, facing reality, prime minister Tsipras will eventually get real. A patient Europe will offer face-saving compromises. As a wily and power-conscious operator, Tsipras could still do a Lula-style U-turn instead of ending up in history books as the prime minister who broke his country. But it could be a close call. And it could well be a rough ride for Greece first before Syriza bows to reality. If worst came to worst in Athens, and I still believe it won\u2019t come to that, Europe would rather cut its losses than fund the perennial basket case into which an overdose of populist policies could turn Greece. The risk of accidental Grexit is real. We put it at 35%, well below par but still serious. Fortunately, Europe would have the defences it needs to contain the potential financial and economic contagion. The real issue to watch in Euope is the risk of political contagion. Will the likely clash between Syriza and reality deflate the allure of populists in Rome, Madrid and Paris or stoke the populist anger against the indignities of real life? We bet that reason will prevail despite the occasional hiccup. AM Shares are now being routed in Athens -- shares in its biggest banks, such as Piraeus and Eurobank, are down by around 20%. The five-year bond which Greece sold to investors last April, in its triumphant return to the markets, has hit its lowest ever level. The yield on the debt (which moves inversely to the price) hit an all-time high of 13.5% this morning; showing a greater risk that Greece will default. It\u2019s remarkable to think that Greece was swamped with demand at that auction. It sold \u20ac3bn of debt, but received offers for \u20ac20bn. Investors clearly believed that the Greek debt crisis was over.... Alexis Tsipras\u2019s determination to renegotiate Greece\u2019s borrowings will alarm many in the eurozone, particularly the north. But as HSBC\u2019s well-respected chief economist, Stephen King, explains, it takes two to create a debt crisis: (BOP=Balance of Payments) And here\u2019s finance minister Yanis Varoufakis attending the first cabinet meeting, where PM Tsipras warned the government faces a very difficult task. Greek bonds have weakened sharply since Greece froze its privatisation plans and vowed to seek debt relief. That has driven up the yield, or interest rate, further into dangerous levels. GREEK 3-YEAR GOVT BOND YIELD RISES 183 BPS TO 16.03%, HIGHEST IN THREE WEEKS - TRADEWEB GREEK 10-YEAR GOVT BOND YIELD RISES 50 BPS TO 10.30% - TRADEWEB GREEK 5-YEAR GOVT BOND YIELD HITS RECORD HIGH OF 13.11% - TRADEWEB Greek banking stocks have shed a third (!) of their value this week: Alexis Tsipras then told his cabinet that the international mood towards Greece is changing. He predicts positive talks with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who heads up the eurogroup of finance ministers, in Athens on Friday. And the prime minister reiterates that ministers must deliver on their pre-election pledges, declaring: We must not disappoint the voters who gave us a mandate. Alexis Tsipras has just held his first cabinet meeting in Athen, and details are hitting the wires now. He told ministers that they face an extremely difficult task, with the people expecting radical changes from their government. He vowed to restore national sovereignty and dignity to Greece. And the new prime minister insisted that he will push for a debt renegotiation deal, saying: We are a government of national salvation. Our aim is to negotiate debt relief. Tsipras also pledged not to pursue destructive clashes with creditors. And he told ministers that they must tackle unemployment, and seek \u201cbalanced budgets\u201d but not unrealistic surpluses. And he vowed to fight vested interests and end \u201cclientelism\u201d in Greek society; we are responsible only to the people. (quotes via Reuters) Economist Megan Greene of Manulife Asset Management (a eurozone-crisis expert) says Tsipras\u2019s government is ready for a fight with its lenders: The sell-off is accelerating: Greece\u2019s new foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias, has insisted this morning that Athens still wants to play a full part in European affairs. Greek bank shares are also falling again, sending the main ATG index into the red for the third day running. Shares in energy firm PCC and Piraeus Port have both tumbled by around 7% at the start of trading in Athens, after the government halted plans to sell its majority stake in both firms. GREEK ATG STOCK INDEX FALLS 0.8% AT OPEN GREEK BANKING SECTOR INDEX FALLS 3.7% SHARES IN GREEK UTILITY PPC FALL 7.2% AFTER GOVT PLANS TO FREEZE PRIVATISATION PROCESS SHARES IN PIRAEUS PORT FALL 6.6% AFTER GOVT PLANS TO STOP PLANNED SALE OF 67% STAKE IN COMPANY Syriza is also planning to help poorer Greeks by raising the minimum wage: Greece\u2019s lenders had forced the previous government to cut wages to boost competitiveness, one factor that has driven so many people into poverty. Devaluation, that traditional way of making a country more competitive - and lowering the real value of its debt - was obviously not an option in the eurozone. Germany\u2019s biggest newspaper isn\u2019t showing much sympathy for a Greek debt deal, flags up ING analyst Carsten Brzeski: European stock markets have inched higher, despite events in Greece. The FTSE 100 has gained18 points or 0.3% in early trading to 6830. Investors are cheered by Apple, which smashed profit forecasts last night. They\u2019re also waiting for the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly statement on monetary policy, due at 7pm tonight, which will show how close it is to raising interest rates. Gerald Lyons, who advises the Mayor of London on economic policy, reckons the Fed can be wait.... The new Greek government has also pledged to reverse the unpopular \u2018mobility scheme\u2019 which was used to lay off thousands of public sector workers, rolling back another key bailout measure. George Katrougkalos told Mega TV: \u201cIt will be one of the first pieces of legislation that I will bring in as a minister.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Greece\u2019s new anti-austerity government is making a dramatic start today, starting to unravel key parts of the country\u2019s bailout deal. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s administration is making good on the promises it made during the campaign, just hours after being sworn in. Energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis has announced this morning that he will freeze plans to privatise the country\u2019s dominant power utility PPC (in which the government holds a majority stake). Lafazanis told Greek TV that: \u201cWe will halt immediately any privatisation of PPC.\u201d Greece\u2019s lenders had forced the country to liberalise its energy market, as a condition of its \u20ac240bn bailout. Tsipras\u2019s government has also pulled the plug on the sale of a stake in the country\u2019s largest port. Reuters has the story: One of the first decisions announced by the new government was stopping the planned sale of a 67% stake in the Piraeus Port Authority, agreed under its international bailout deal for which China\u2019s Cosco Group and four other suitors had been shortlisted. \u201cThe Cosco deal will be reviewed to the benefit of the Greek people,\u201d Thodoris Dritsas, the deputy minister in charge of the shipping portfolio, told Reuters. Tsipras is clearly waving a few red rags (or possibly red flags?) at Brussels and the IMF; an early skirmish in the battle over Greece\u2019s debts. And that\u2019s before the radical finance minister,Yanis Varoufakis, gets to work. He\u2019ll receive the keys to the finance ministry at 2pm local time (noon GMT). We\u2019ll be tracking all the key events in Greece, and beyond, though the day.",

Or: wouldn\u2019t it be cheaper for Europe to write off half its claims on Greece than to risk losing it all?<br></p> <p>The new Greek government and its voters are in for a reality shock. The debate in Athens seems to suffer from four delusions.</p> <p>My best bet remains that, facing reality, prime minister Tsipras will eventually get real. A patient Europe will offer face-saving compromises. As a wily and power-conscious operator, Tsipras could still do a Lula-style U-turn instead of ending up in history books as the prime minister who broke his country. </p> <p>But it could be a close call. And it could well be a rough ride for Greece first before Syriza bows to reality. If worst came to worst in Athens, and I still believe it won\u2019t come to that, Europe would rather cut its losses than fund the perennial basket case into which an overdose of populist policies could turn Greece. The risk of accidental Grexit is real. We put it at 35%, well below par but still serious. </p> <p>Fortunately, Europe would have the defences it needs to contain the potential financial and economic contagion. The real issue to watch in Euope is the risk of political contagion. Will the likely clash between Syriza and reality deflate the allure of populists in Rome, Madrid and Paris or stoke the populist anger against the indignities of real life? We bet that reason will prevail despite the occasional hiccup.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>AM</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-01-28T11:32:29.511Z\">at 11.32am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54c8c089e4b0bff06d8666cf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-01-28T11:01:55.870Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Shares are now being routed in Athens </strong>-- shares in its biggest banks, such as Piraeus and Eurobank, are down by around <strong>20%.</strong> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FerroTV/statuses/560388385307897856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Greek stocks -7% and counting <a href=\"http://t.co/SUzan3SvOZ\">pic.twitter.com/SUzan3SvOZ</a></p>&mdash; Jonathan Ferro (@FerroTV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FerroTV/status/560388385307897856\">January 28, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/katie_martin_FX/statuses/560390288418828288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Greek markets today. *high whistle* <a href=\"http://t.co/cjU9v2DJLZ\">pic.twitter.com/cjU9v2DJLZ</a></p>&mdash; Katie Martin (@katie_martin_FX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katie_martin_FX/status/560390288418828288\">January 28, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54c8bd5ee4b087a04fca56d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-01-28T10:51:01.906Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The five-year bond which Greece sold to investors last April, in its triumphant return to the markets, has hit its lowest ever level.</strong><br></p> <p>The yield on the debt (which moves inversely to the price) hit an all-time high of 13.5% this morning; showing a greater risk that Greece will default.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"992dd5de4042306c44f346156655c8a64d28efdc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422442129674/10b5501b-a277-46d7-8c2c-c873a3172700-460x235.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek five-year bond yield\" width=\"460\" height=\"235\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek five-year bond yield</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s remarkable to think that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/10/greece-raises-3bn-euro-successful-bond-sale\">Greece was swamped with demand at that auction</a>.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "<p>Bad policy has entrenched ethanol in the US energy industry despite its many drawbacks. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to end its use and make way for other biofuels, but with gas prices on the downswing, it may not be enough<br></p>", 
      "body": "<p>Ethanol was supposed to do a lot for the US.</p> <p>It was supposed to help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It was supposed to combat climate change. It was supposed to be a gateway for more renewable fuels technology. It was supposed to reduce gasoline prices because it was cheaper.</p> <p>So when Congress mandated in 2005 that 10% of the nation\u2019s fuel supply had to be blended with ethanol, which is derived from corn, there were some idealistic hopes that renewable fuels would wean us off fossil fuels.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t worked that way. </p> <p>The US is reducing its dependence on foreign oil, but not because of ethanol. It\u2019s because we\u2019re pumping more of our own oil here, thanks to fracking. It hasn\u2019t led to more research and development of advanced biofuels. <br></p> <p>Instead, we\u2019re putting nearly 40% of the US corn crop in our gas tanks, which some argue pushes up food prices. </p> <p>And lately ethanol is not even a cheaper alternative to gasoline.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2015/jan/06/crude-oil-price-drop-benefits-rich\">In the US, one lesson from oil prices: rich people win, again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since mid-December, ethanol prices have risen above reformulated gasoline prices because of the sharp drop in crude-oil and gas prices, along with a rise in corn prices. <br></p> <p>As of 26 January, Chicago Board of Trade ethanol futures were holding around $1.448 a gallon, whereas New York Mercantile Exchange reformulated gasoline futures prices were at $1.3167, giving the renewable fuel a 13-cent premium. </p> <p>Ethanol prices are not likely to get any cheaper anytime soon, unless gasoline prices start to rise.</p> <p>Luckily for consumers, it shouldn\u2019t affect them too much at the gas pump. Scott Irwin, professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois, said it\u2019s a possibility prices could rise at the retail level because there\u2019s been about a 30-cents-per-gallon swing in the cost of ethanol. But that may only translate to about a 3-cents-per-gallon increase when filling a tank, since ethanol represents only 10% of the fuel.</p> <p>What else might be causing higher ethanol prices?

      "bodyText": "Ethanol was supposed to do a lot for the US. It was supposed to help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It was supposed to combat climate change. It was supposed to be a gateway for more renewable fuels technology. It was supposed to reduce gasoline prices because it was cheaper. So when Congress mandated in 2005 that 10% of the nation\u2019s fuel supply had to be blended with ethanol, which is derived from corn, there were some idealistic hopes that renewable fuels would wean us off fossil fuels. It hasn\u2019t worked that way. The US is reducing its dependence on foreign oil, but not because of ethanol. It\u2019s because we\u2019re pumping more of our own oil here, thanks to fracking. It hasn\u2019t led to more research and development of advanced biofuels. Instead, we\u2019re putting nearly 40% of the US corn crop in our gas tanks, which some argue pushes up food prices. And lately ethanol is not even a cheaper alternative to gasoline. Since mid-December, ethanol prices have risen above reformulated gasoline prices because of the sharp drop in crude-oil and gas prices, along with a rise in corn prices. As of 26 January, Chicago Board of Trade ethanol futures were holding around $1.448 a gallon, whereas New York Mercantile Exchange reformulated gasoline futures prices were at $1.3167, giving the renewable fuel a 13-cent premium. Ethanol prices are not likely to get any cheaper anytime soon, unless gasoline prices start to rise. Luckily for consumers, it shouldn\u2019t affect them too much at the gas pump. Scott Irwin, professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois, said it\u2019s a possibility prices could rise at the retail level because there\u2019s been about a 30-cents-per-gallon swing in the cost of ethanol. But that may only translate to about a 3-cents-per-gallon increase when filling a tank, since ethanol represents only 10% of the fuel. What else might be causing higher ethanol prices? It could be the Renewable Fuels Standard passed by Congress in 2005, said Don Roose, president of US Commodities, an agricultural consulting firm. \u201cBy mandating that 10% of the gas has to have ethanol in it, we have an artificial place to put ethanol,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the dominant reason [for higher prices].\u201d The corn-based ethanol mandate has lost many of its champions in the past few years, and there have even been moves to get rid of it. Most famously, such arguments cropped up during the rise of commodity prices in 2008 ahead of the credit crisis, and again in 2012 when a midwestern drought decimated corn supplies.

      "bodyText": "Canary Wharf is to be bought by Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and Canadian investor Brookfield Properties for \u00a32.6bn, after Songbird, the owner of the Docklands estate, admitted defeat. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s deadline, Songbird said its three major shareholders intend to accept the offer, and once this happens it will drop its resistance and recommend the offer to smaller investors. This means the Qatari fund can add east London\u2019s financial district, with its cluster of towers, to its portfolio of prized assets, including Harrods and the Shard. Songbird shares rose 6.5% to 342.25p on the surprise announcement. Songbird directors who own shares will also accept for their own holdings. Non-executive directors David O\u2019Connor and Alex Midgen, who were appointed by the Glick shareholders, have stakes that are worth \u00a31.9m and \u00a3390,000 respectively at the 350p offer price. The Qatari Investment Authority (QIA), Songbird\u2019s biggest shareholder with a 28.6% stake, and Brookfield have been trying to gain control of the property company since November. They welcomed the announcement. The backing from New York investor Simon Glick (with a 26% stake), the China Investment Corporation and Morgan Stanley, the three biggest shareholders after the Qatari fund, means that QIA and Brookfield have secured 85.6% support. Songbird owns the bulk of Canary Wharf Group, the owner of the Docklands estate. It is expanding for the first time since the 2008 banking crisis with plans for 30 buildings, including 3,100 homes, at Wood Wharf at its eastern edge. Songbird also owns 50% stakes in the Walkie Talkie skyscraper in the City and the Shell Centre on the South Bank, which it is redeveloping with QIA subsidiary Qatari Diar. Songbird, chaired by David Pritchard, had hoped to find another acquiror willing to offer more but talks with several parties came to nothing, partly due to the company\u2019s complex ownership structure. The firm maintained that the Qataris\u2019 final offer of 350p a share, up from the initial approach of 295p, was too low, and formally rejected the terms on 12 January. An independent valuation carried out in November put Songbird\u2019s value at 381p a share. Minority investors Third Avenue Management, Madison International Realty and EMS Capital have already indicated their willingness to sell. Songbird is likely to to be de-listed from the stock market following the takeover. Qatar stepped in with China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund in 2009 to rescue Songbird when the business came close to collapsing under its debt. Sir George Iacobescu, chairman of Canary Wharf Group, and the rest of the management will stay on. A source from the group said: \u201cIt is still very much business as usual and the company will continue its development drive. \u201cQIA and Brookfield have expressed their appreciation of the achievements of Canary Wharf as a company, its management and its assets. George has been assured by the potential new shareholders of their full support for the group\u2019s business plan and first rate staff. \u201cHe and the team are looking forward to working with them during what will be one of the busiest and most successful phases of Canary Wharf so far.\u201d The Docklands estate is the creation of the late Paul Reichmann who brokered the terms of the ambitious building project with then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, in 1987. The Canadian property tycoon bowed out in 2004 after an ugly takeover battle that saw Songbird, then a consortium of investors led by Morgan Stanley, take control of Canary Wharf Group.",

      "body": "<p>If you logged into Facebook over the holidays, you may have noticed a video from Kate Spade, the women\u2019s clothier that is best known for preppy classics and structured handbags. <br></p> <p>Called \u201cThe Waiting Game\u201d, the two-and-a-half-minute film features Academy Award-nominated actress Anna Kendrick as a girl laden down with shopping bags who discovers she\u2019s locked out of her Manhattan apartment. <br></p> <p>While she waits, Kendrick tries on her haul from Kate Spade. Then, in a fit of inspiration, she knots a clutch of scarves together and ties it to a glittering stiletto to pull down the stairs of the fire escape and climb into her apartment through the window. The credits roll and an accompanying link nudges viewers to the checkout line, reminding them they can shop the film at the retailer\u2019s website. <br></p> <p>In less than one month (between November and December 2014), \u201cThe Waiting Game\u201d reached over 9.9 million people and garnered over 49,000 likes, comments and shares.</p> <p>This has been, it is safe to say, the highlight of Nicolas Franchet\u2019s year. <br></p> <p>Franchet is the head of retail and e-commerce on Facebook\u2019s global vertical marketing team. He told the Guardian that since June, Facebook has served up an average of 1bn video views a day, with two-thirds on mobile devices. </p> <p>He pointed out that retailers can track conversions \u2013 industry parlance for the number of audience views that turn into actual sales. </p> <p>And what if a user watches the video but doesn\u2019t buy the advertisers\u2019 product? Through Facebook, retailers have the ability to specifically target those people who saw the ad and serve them ads for specific products to further encourage them to purchase. <br></p> <p>\u201cThat is very conducive to commerce,\u201d Franchet said.</p> <p>Having famous actresses at Facebook\u2019s disposal isn\u2019t necessary to increase reach and revenue. Instead, Franchet maintained that user-generated video is just as popular and, in fact, encouraged. </p> <p>Indeed, last month Facebook instructed everyone from journalists in the field to public figures to \u201cpost raw videos that are compelling, shareable clips that no one else will have\u201d. Like this blurry eight-second clip <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10152540670855369\">Taylor Swift took of herself</a> singing while driving.</p> <p>Last week, Facebook announced that over the last year, the number of video posts per person <a href=\"http://media.fb.com/2015/01/07/what-the-shift-to-video-means-for-creators/\">increased 75% globally</a> and 94% in the US. <br></p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s up 50% from earlier in the year,\u201d Franchet said, making video \u201ca massive new tool for marketers\u201d, especially small- to medium-sized businesses that don\u2019t have resources to spend on creating and producing traditional video ads. <br></p> <p>According to Facebook\u2019s data, more than half of the people who return to the social network daily watch at least one video and three-quarters of people in the US who use Facebook say they tend to discover the videos they watch from their feeds.</p> <p>The way Franchet, an eBay veteran, sees it, Facebook is not only a platform for businesses to get discovered by prospective customers, but its tools such as ads and their corresponding analytics \u201care very compatible with closing a sale\u201d \u2013 something that is compelling to small businesses looking to expand beyond the borders of their laptops, he said.</p> <p>To help small business \u201cright-size\u201d their marketing efforts amid millions of potential consumers, Franchet points to Facebook\u2019s recently launched tool that allows independent brick-and-mortar retailers to do location-based targeting to users near its shop. <br></p> <p>Since Facebook launched pages for business in 2007, organizations of all sizes have staked their claim, lured by the social network\u2019s enormous yet captive audience. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/feb/04/facebook-in-numbers-statistics\">Over 1.2 billion users</a> check into Facebook each month and, according to comScore, more than 20% of people\u2019s time on mobile is spent on Facebook services, including Instagram.</p> <p>But what Facebook has to do is turn that viewership into profits. <br></p> <p>This and other paid tools are expected to become a bigger part of marketing budgets this year. A <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/marketing/digital/research/digital-marketing-spend/cmo-spend-2015/\">recent Gartner survey</a> of companies in the US, Canada and the UK found that half of brands are planning to boost their digital marketing spend by an average of 17% in 2015, in hopes of enhancing customers\u2019 experience and behavior via mobile.</p> <p>Yet some experts and analysts aren\u2019t totally sold.</p> <p>Nate Elliott, vice-president and principal analyst covering social media at Forrester Research, is puzzled as to why the social network continues to mount challenges like this for itself.</p> <p>Facebook used to be the place brands came to converse with their fans, he says. Those who \u201cliked\u201d a brand on Facebook were predominately existing customers, which made the social network a good place for businesses to build loyalty.</p> <p>These devotees were previously served ads through unpaid distribution, otherwise known as organic reach. This meant that an average of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150675727637217\">16% of fans</a> of a brand saw a brand\u2019s content without the brand having to spend a penny. The bigger the collection of fans, the bigger the brand\u2019s potential for reaching more consumers.</p> <p>Then Facebook reported that it was doing away with organic reach altogether. <br></p> <p>\u201cThey have much less competition in the field of building relationships with existing customers,\u201d said Elliott. \u201cYet they actively disassembled that functionality. I think they could have found better way to make money than to eliminate the primary value brands were getting from Facebook.\u201d</p> <p>From his time at both eBay and Facebook, Franchet is convinced that small business owners are the shrewdest business people.<br></p> <p>\u201cThey are smarter and faster than big brands,\u201d he said, and try different kinds of marketing while focusing on the most bang for their buck. <br></p> <p>Franchet said the power of small businesses is something that he has observed and is translating to Facebook\u2019s platform in the form of an \u201cimpressive\u201d 3m videos. </p> <p>Putting those videos in front of the \u201cright\u201d people and then measuring for sales is something Franchet said that \u201cyou haven\u2019t been able to do with organic reach for a very long time.\u201d</p> <p>But Elliott contends that growth might be overblown. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a growing medium for brands,\u201d large or small, Elliott told the Guardian. <br></p> <p>\u201cMarketers value video because statistically it drives greater brand impact than most other forms of creative [advertising],\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd marketers love the creative format.\u201d </p> <p>Even so, Elliott says, Facebook is going to need to be careful about pushing too many video ads into user news feeds, especially in mobile. What Facebook is flogging as a tool for people to discover new brands and products may actually pose even greater challenges for the social network, Elliott said.</p> <p>Despite offering brands the means to target very specific audiences who\u2019ve yet to interact with them, Elliott said, \u201cthe reality is I can drive discovery [of brands] with TV ads, search, radio, banners on Yahoo. There are a million ways to drive discovery, and Facebook has a long way to go to prove it is a better option.\u201d</p> <p>With search, for example, Elliott points out that brands are already spending the majority of their search ad budget on generic and unbranded keywords like \u201cfamily beach vacation\u201d or \u201cbest rewards credit cards\u201d.</p> <p>When a consumer does a search, he maintains, they are looking to solve a problem. <br></p> <p>Marketers can use those searches more efficiently to convert to a sale, says Elliott, because the consumer is actively looking for a solution at that exact moment. \u201cThat is something Facebook can\u2019t offer marketers,\u201d Elliott said. </p> <p>\u201cWhen you see something in your feed from a company, that may be a chance to discover, but it also may be off-putting because you weren\u2019t looking for it,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Though video is designed to be distracting, most current ads have an instant-play feature for the visual only. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhat a marketer really wants is someone to click and play the audio,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cI think Facebook will find a lot fewer people going to be willing to do that on a mobile device.\u201d</p> <p>Marketing strategist and the author of Youtility, <a href=\"http://jaybaer.com/\">Jay Baer</a>, concurs. \u201cOn one hand, video is a perfect way to create additional touch points with customers and prospects online,\u201d he said, especially because many people simply prefer to watch videos rather than read text.</p> <p>Baer believes part of what\u2019s making video very effective right now is Facebook\u2019s auto-play feature, which starts videos playing without users having to click to start them. <br></p> <p>\u201cBecause auto-play can ring up bandwidth usage pretty fast, there are rumors that Facebook will disable it on mobile devices,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could have a slight, short-term negative impact on video as a customer outreach mechanism, but over time the trend will accelerate.\u201d <br></p> <p>Baer says Facebook is now even competing with YouTube for video viewers.

      "bodyText": "About 2,000 jobs are at risk after Tesco revealed the identities of the 43 unprofitable stores it will close as part of new chief executive Dave Lewis\u2019s efforts to revive the embattled grocer. The retailer said it would be closing 30 convenience stores \u2013 18 Express outlets and 12 inner-city Metro shops \u2013 along with seven superstores and six of its 12 non-food ventures, called Homeplus. None of Tesco\u2019s large hypermarkets \u2013 the Tesco Extra stores \u2013 has been earmarked for closure. The closures follow the abandonment of 49 sites where the retailer planned stores but has not built them. John Kershaw, a food retail analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: \u201cExpect Extra to be addressed in time. However, given they typically were extensions to over-trading stores, they are probably still marginally profitable, even if having suffered marked deterioration. [Former chief executive Philip] Clarke used to talk of a handful of problem Extras and Lewis has said that two thirds of the [247-strong] Extra estate is high quality.\u201d The announced closures are spread across Britain and illustrate the scale of Tesco\u2019s over-expansion during the past 10 years. The demise of its Liverpool Kensington Express store will still leave shoppers with 18 Tesco outlets within two miles of the stricken store, while there are 14 Tescos within that distance of the doomed Express on South Tottenham High Road in north London, plus 12 that near to the Express on Longbridge Road in Barking, east London, which is also scheduled to close. Lewis said: \u201cIn January, I announced that our performance as a business has fallen significantly short of where we would want it to be and that to protect the future of the business in the UK we would close 43 unprofitable stores. \u201cThe decision to close the stores has been exceptionally difficult to take. I recognise it will affect many hardworking colleagues, our customers and local communities. \u201cOur priority is to explain what this announcement means for our colleagues and, wherever possible, offer them alternative roles with Tesco. We will continue to serve our customers through other local stores and our dotcom service.\u201d The Express and Homeplus stores will close on 15 March; the Tesco Metros and Superstores on the list on 4 April. The identity of the stores has been revealed after Lewis said this month that he was closing the Cheshunt head office in Hertfordshire, as well as the 43 closures and the 49 planned stores now abandoned. Pauline Foulke, national officer at shop workers union Usdaw, said: \u201cThis is devastating news for more than 2,000 dedicated staff in the 43 Tesco stores across the UK who have worked hard to make their shop viable during a difficult time for the company. \u201cWe will now enter into full and meaningful consultation meetings on this proposal, where we will look closely at the company\u2019s business case for the closures. Our priority is to maximise employment within Tesco, seek redeployment opportunities for members, where possible, and to keep job losses to a minimum.\u201d There are 2,614 Tesco stores in Britain, a figure that increased by 37 during the previous 12 months, at the time of the grocer\u2019s interim results released in October. The stores cover a total of 39m sq ft (3.6m sq metres).",

The Docklands Development Corporation was set up by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s environment secretary Michael Heseltine in 1981 to breathe new life into London\u2019s old port, and Travelstead got its backing. But he didn\u2019t have the funding and eventually knocked on the door of Reichmann\u2019s company, Olympia &amp; York, in 1987. Reichmann did his own research among London\u2019s financial community. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/28/paul-reichmann\">He told the National Post newspaper</a>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I had 29 meetings with business leaders in London to see if such a project made sense. I did not ask them if they would move to Canary Wharf. The answer would have been no. My main question was: are you happy with your operating premises or do you see the need to do something dramatic? What I detected was the great majority were very unhappy with their premises, but their attitude was that they had no choice.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Canadian tycoon befriended Thatcher, who agreed to provide generous tax breaks. Reichmann, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/28/paul-reichmann\">who died in 2013</a>, had already delivered a similar project in Manhattan. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"344cd3e01cbfe9e184b0d5cd8505b2dfc2cee626\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422442823295/849a6f64-109f-4e8a-9dbe-43cffe94253a-281x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A poster on a Docklands community billboard protests the Canary Wharf development in February 1987.\" width=\"281\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster on a Docklands community billboard protests the Canary Wharf development in February 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Woolfitt/Adam Woolfitt/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1988<br></h2> <p>Construction began. <br></p> <h2>1990<br></h2> <p>The 244m Canary Wharf skyscraper at One Canada Square, topped by a pyramid, was the first tower to rise out of the docks in 1990. It was Britain\u2019s tallest building for two decades until it was overtaken by the Shard in 2010 (architecture critics thought it was too tall and Thatcher and Prince Charles didn\u2019t like it either).<br></p> <h2>1991</h2> <p>The first tenants moved to Canary Wharf in 1991.

      "bodyText": "Canary Wharf is to be bought by Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and Canadian investor Brookfield Properties for \u00a32.6bn after Songbird, the owner of the Docklands estate, admitted defeat. Canary Wharf takes its name from the quay where fruit and veg from the Mediterranean and Canary islands was once unloaded. The disused Docklands site, formed by a loop in the Thames, was turned into a second financial district to rival the City of London after 1987. Today, Canary Wharf\u2019s cluster of skyscrapers in east London is home to some of the world\u2019s biggest banks, such as Citigroup and HSBC. 1987 Canary Wharf is the creation of Canadian property tycoon Paul Reichmann, but the idea for an office complex in the Isle of Dogs came from American bankers Michael von Clemm and G Ware Travelstead. The Docklands Development Corporation was set up by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s environment secretary Michael Heseltine in 1981 to breathe new life into London\u2019s old port, and Travelstead got its backing. But he didn\u2019t have the funding and eventually knocked on the door of Reichmann\u2019s company, Olympia &amp; York, in 1987. Reichmann did his own research among London\u2019s financial community. He told the National Post newspaper: I had 29 meetings with business leaders in London to see if such a project made sense. I did not ask them if they would move to Canary Wharf. The answer would have been no. My main question was: are you happy with your operating premises or do you see the need to do something dramatic? What I detected was the great majority were very unhappy with their premises, but their attitude was that they had no choice. The Canadian tycoon befriended Thatcher, who agreed to provide generous tax breaks. Reichmann, who died in 2013, had already delivered a similar project in Manhattan. 1988 Construction began. 1990 The 244m Canary Wharf skyscraper at One Canada Square, topped by a pyramid, was the first tower to rise out of the docks in 1990. It was Britain\u2019s tallest building for two decades until it was overtaken by the Shard in 2010 (architecture critics thought it was too tall and Thatcher and Prince Charles didn\u2019t like it either). 1991 The first tenants moved to Canary Wharf in 1991. The banks Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse First Boston, HSBC and Citigroup, and the Financial Services Authority all moved to the Docklands in subsequent years. Barclays was the last clearing bank to leave Lombard Street in the City for Canary Wharf, in 2005. Much of Fleet Street also decamped east, including the Telegraph, the Mirror and the Independent, although only the Mirror remains. 1992 But it wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. In 1992, following a property crash, Olympia &amp; York filed for bankruptcy and Canary Wharf was placed in administration. 1995 Undaunted, three years later Reichmann pulled together a consortium of wealthy investors (including Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal and the American media mogul Larry Tisch) to buy Canary Wharf back from the banks for \u00a3800m. 1999 As the property market recovered and more firms moved to the Docklands, the business floated on the London stock market. 2004 Reichmann finally lost control of Canary Wharf during a fierce 11-month takeover battle, ending his 20-year involvement with the project. Canary Wharf Group was acquired by Songbird Estates, a consortium led by US investment bank Morgan Stanley. 2009 The Qatari Investment Authority became a major Songbird shareholder, after coming to the company\u2019s rescue with China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund in 2009, when Songbird almost collapsed under the weight of its debts. 2014 Canary Wharf is now spreading east, the first expansion of the estate since the 2008 financial crisis. There are plans for 30 buildings at Wood Wharf, including a 57-storey cylindrical residential skyscraper facing the waters of South Dock, designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, the Swiss architects behind Tate Modern and the Bird\u2019s Nest in Beijing. The eastern extension is set to almost double the number of people working and living in the area within the next 10 years. It will get a big boost from Crossrail, the \u00a316bn railway running east-west across London that is due to open in 2018.",

However, while the share of UK households owning a motorcycle is not on the rise, the over-50s age group is increasingly engaging in the sector. In 2014, the over-50s in the UK spent a total of \u00a3340m on motorcycle purchases \u2013 nearly a third of total motorcycle spending.

      "bodyText": "Severn Trent will cut payouts to shareholders to guarantee lower household water bills following demands by the regulator. The company, which supplies water to 4.2m homes and businesses across the Midlands and central Wales, said it would cut its dividend for the next financial year to March 2016 by 5% to 80.66p It is also scrapping its policy of inflation-busting dividend increases over the long-term to save cash. Until 2020, the annual dividend paid to shareholders will increase at no less than the rate of retail price inflation. Previously shareholders got a better deal, with dividend growth equivalent to retail price inflation plus 3% \u2013 a policy which will run for the last time during the current financial year to the end of March. The company said that by paying less to shareholders, water bills would fall in real terms for the next five years to around \u00a360 below the industry average. Next year average Severn Trent bills will fall by \u00a34 to \u00a3329. Liv Garfield, chief executive, said: \u201cAt Severn Trent we always seek to strike the right balance between the service customers receive, the bills they pay, and returns to investors and we believe our plan for the next five years achieves that balance, delivering better services, better value and a healthier environment. \u201cThe price review has been a challenging process but has led to a great outcome for customers.\u201d Industry regulator Ofwat ruled in December that average water bills should fall by \u00a320 to \u00a3376 over the next five years. Jonson Cox, Ofwat chairman, said at the time: \u201cThis is an important step in maintaining customers\u2019 trust and confidence in the water sector. We are bringing down bills so customers can expect value for money, while investors can earn a fair return.\u201d Severn Trent also announced a \u00a3100m share buyback programme. The company said its plans would help it maintain a sustainable investment grade credit rating. Severn Trent has pledged to invest \u00a36.2bn over the next five years to improve its service. Targets include fixing 100% of visible leaks within 24 hours and reducing interruptions to water supply by more than 50%.

      "bodyText": "Ikea paid out hundreds of millions of euros in bonuses to its staff last year after growth in China and recovery in its European markets boosted sales. The Swedish group famed for its flat-pack furniture and meatballs said that sales grew in most of its markets in 2014, but profits were flat after a big payout to staff. Ikea contributed \u20ac200m (\u00a3150m) to a staff loyalty scheme, and a growing number of employees took part in a bonus scheme, for which it booked a \u20ac98m cost. The company, which has 338 stores worldwide, reported net profits of \u20ac3.3bn in the 12 months to the end of August. Peter Agnefj\u00e4ll, the chief executive, said: \u201cIn the past year, we grew in almost all our markets, with China, Russia and Hungary being the fastest growing.\u201d Ikea has been opening new stores in China to take advantage of the country\u2019s rising middle-class. Agnefj\u00e4ll added: \u201cNorth America performed well and while the challenging economic situation may not be over, Europe continued to show improvements. An especially positive sign was the growth in most of southern Europe.\u201d Its business in Portugal did particularly well and the situation in Spain is improving, Agnefj\u00e4ll said, despite those being two of the worst hit economies during the depths of the eurozone crisis. Ikea\u2019s largest markets for sales last year were Germany, the US, France, Russia, and the UK, and the chain opened in Croatia for the first time. Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of stores open for less than a year, grew by 3.7%, while total sales in local currencies increased by 5.9% to \u20ac28.7bn. The furniture chain has in the past come under scrutiny for its tax arrangements. A recent investigation by the Guardian found that Ikea was among a number of large, high-profile corporations to arrange specially designed corporate structures with the Luxembourg authorities to limit their tax bills. In a separate section in the retailer\u2019s review of 2014, Ikea said it pays corporate and income taxes \u201cin accordance with laws and regulations, wherever we are present as retailer, manufacturer or in any other role\u201d. It paid corporate taxes of \u20ac801m in 2014, as well as other property and business taxes, custom duties, and environmental taxes totalling \u20ac715m. Earlier this month Ikea said sales in the UK \u2013 where it has 18 stores \u2013 soared in the final four months of 2014 after it introduced UK-sized mattresses and beds for the first time.",

Right Move still looks well placed to hold on to its market leadership in the UK property portal sector. However, this is already discounted in its valuation today in our view, even after the partial de-rating of the stock in the last year. Zoopla shares offer much better upside, taking a longer term view that OTM does not succeed \u2013 but it is being disrupted much more in the near term. We see both stocks moving lower over the next 6-12 months.",
