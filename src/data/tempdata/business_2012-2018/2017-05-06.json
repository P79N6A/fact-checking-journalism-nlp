      "bodyText": "Last week we saw a prime example of the difficulties Malcolm Turnbull faces when he tries to do something good. On Tuesday, while he and the education minister, Simon Birmingham, were getting ready to announce a big overhaul of school funding that would finally have the government embracing a progressive funding model, his predecessor, Tony Abbott, was doing his best impersonation of Kevin Rudd. As Rudd was apt to do whenever Julia Gillard was set to make a major announcement, Abbott posted a photo on Twitter to divert attention. It was of his appearance at the offices of the IPA, and depicted a scene so pathetic you could almost detect from the faces present a befuddlement at the life choices they had made that led them to such a sad position. The IPA is a thinktank that exists to talk up white western civilisation, deny climate change and argue for small government \u2013 low taxes and even lower welfare and services. It was its type of thinking that was behind Joe Hockey and Abbott\u2019s first budget, one so lacking in political and policy intelligence that it ended Hockey\u2019s political career and resulted in Abbott going from being prime minister to a backbench MP reduced to attending lame morning teas. The next day, Abbott continued his sniping on radio as he complained that the school spending proposals had yet to go through the party room and that \u201cat this stage it\u2019s hard to see that any of this extra funding is specifically tied to better academic outcomes and better student performance\u201d. He\u2019s Tony, and he\u2019s here to help. Since taking over the prime ministership, Turnbull has for the most part embraced the hard right wing of his political party to the extent that there was barely any difference between his and Abbott\u2019s prime ministership. You could argue he needed to do so, that his power was so weak he had to placate the rump who support Abbott, who believe the IPA makes some good points, who see welfare recipients as bludgers, and who think we need to protect our glorious western civilisation from Muslims and anyone who does not follow our \u201cvalues\u201d. But such a strategy has proved about as popular as the smallpox inflicted on indigenous populations by those glorious western civilisations. And so last week we saw signs of change, an embrace, to use one of Turnbull\u2019s favourite phrases, of the \u201cpenetrating glimpse of the obvious\u201d. Turnbull has seemingly realised that to cling to the 2014 budget is to cling to political death. Last week the government leaked that the zombie welfare cuts from that budget, such as a four-week waiting period for going on the dole, are to be dumped. It also looks set to unfreeze the Medicare rebate to doctors. And most crucially, it embraced the funding model proposed under the former ALP government by David Gonski. It appears Turnbull has grasped that despite what groups such as the IPA and the hard-right rump in his party would have us believe, Australians actually like well-funded and fairly provided government services. The schools funding reform package will result in a much better targeting of commonwealth funds than was ever proposed or considered by the Abbott government. Is it less money than the ALP would have provided? Yes \u2013 the ALP would say it\u2019s lower by $22bn over 10 years, although that figure appears less than certain at this point. But there is no getting around the fact the funding will now be better targeted \u2013 a smaller share of the money to the schools in the wealthiest areas, and a bigger share going to the poorest areas. And it is 180 degrees away from Turnbull\u2019s idiotic idea of last year for the commonwealth to pay for private schools and states to pay for public ones. Perhaps there needs to be a bigger total amount of money, but at least we are on the way to having a fair distribution \u2013 freed from the Gillard government\u2019s foolish, but at the time politically necessary, promise that no school would be worse off. It certainly is not perfect, and as with any policy we need to await the details to see the full impact. As the Mitchell Institute\u2019s Brownyn Hinz for example, notes, while it is all very well to talk about needs of schools, assessment of those needs \u201cshould also take into account the different starting points and learning growth of student populations in different schools\u201d. There are those who will suggest Turnbull and Birmingham have wedged the ALP and also flummoxed the unions who campaigned for the Gonski funding model. Personally I couldn\u2019t give a stuff. I really don\u2019t care who enacts progressive policies, so long as they are enacted! But of course one policy doesn\u2019t make a government progressive. Last week as well, the government announced cuts to higher education and changes that will have people earning less than $52,000 paying up to $1,290 more than they would have previously, and all students paying more for their degrees. Similarly, while the government is to spend more money than it would have on schools, we are yet to find out how it is to be paid \u2013 Birmingham only said \u201cthe budget will show clearly how that\u2019s going to occur\u201d. The cuts targeting welfare recipients remain, as does the ending of the 2% \u201cdeficit levy\u201d for those earning more than $180,000. And there appears little sense of any moves on housing affordability that will affect capital gains tax or negative gearing. The weeks around the budget are always as much about media management as they are about policy. Last week, with the announcement on school funding coming straight after and thus somewhat burying the cuts to higher education, the government certainly was trying to create the impression of a good-news budget. But unless the government has decided that ongoing funding for schools is good debt, someone is going to have to pay, and who does and how they do will help determine whether this shift towards progressive policy is anything more than just a brief flirtation away from the rightwing rump of Turnbull\u2019s party.",

      "bodyText": "Nothing says London like the Routemaster bus, tube roundel logo or Harry Beck\u2019s schematic underground network map. Now the capital\u2019s transport authority is seeking to generate cash to reinvest in its tube, train and bus services, using these design classics to sell branded products overseas. Transport for London (TfL) has struck its first global licensing deal, aiming to create a \u00a3100m a year branding business. From designer chairs using tube seat patterns and lamps inspired by bus headlights to London underground map tea towels, its own fashion brand and limited edition sets of Scrabble, TfL plans to take its successful UK licensing programme to global markets. \u201cWe have been chuntering along quite happily for a number of years and built a great foundation in the UK,\u201d said David Ellis, head of intellectual property development for TfL. \u201cSince slightly before the London 2012 Olympics, there has been an energy behind London. We are now hoping to really drive this internationally. It is time to push the brand in key territories across the global market.\u201d Top of the target list are Japan, China, North America and \u2013 closer to home \u2013 Europe, said Ellis. He cites the success of a pop-up shop opened in a Tokyo station in the Ginza shopping district last year as an example of the overseas sales potential. Among items on sale was a trainer made in partnership with Nike, patterned with the font used in all London underground maps, signs, logos, leaflets and on social media. This typeface, Johnston100, is an updated version of the original font, introduced in 1916 by calligrapher Edward Johnston. \u201cIt was way over-subscribed and was a huge success,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWe are now talking to a major Japanese trading company about how to take that forward. If you can build a strong licensing programme in fashion that can lead to accessories. And homewares is where we have also done well in terms of previous licences, such as our collaboration with Aga cookers.\u201d Previous licensing deals have been done with online furniture store Made.com, games maker Mattel and Kirkby Design, whose cushions based on the tube\u2019s retro seat patterns are stocked in outlets including John Lewis. TfL even has its own fashion brand, Roundel London, launched in 2013. TfL would not elaborate on targets for the international programme but licensing industry sources believe it could be a \u00a3100m a year brand in terms of retail sales, or \u00a350m of wholesale value. The organisation would typically expect to retain about 10% of the wholesale figure, meaning the global branding push could generate \u00a35m a year to reinvest in the London transport network if it all goes to plan. \u201cWe are not competing against Disney or other character brands selling merchandise,\u201d said Ellis. \u201cWe are a corporate brand which takes longer to build. We are certainly not going to use huge amounts of public money to advertise. It has to be low-risk commercial income; this is low-margin but high-profit.\u201d He said sales were likely to fluctuate as London\u2019s popularity waxed and waned. \u201cOur brand is synonymous with London. You can see our brand rise and fall with London\u2019s popularity and presence in the global market. There is great potential and it could earn significant income and we are confident it can. But we also go with the ups and downs of the capital city.\u201d The international expansion is partly designed to protect its brands from makers of fake products. Ellis said that TfL currently had more than 90 trademark infringement cases globally, and it gets \u201csix or seven warnings a week\u201d from authorities warning of attempts to register TfL trademarks. \u201cWe must stop other people trying to benefit from our trademark and assets,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, when you trademark a sign or mark you must use them in those classes or cateogries or you could lose rights to them for not trading. We have spent over 100 years building our assets, we have to protect our brands.\u201d TfL\u2019s global licensing strategy will be unveiled by branding agency TSBA, with which it has struck a five-year deal, at the annual Licensing Expo in Las Vegas later this month. \u201cTfL has a fantastic design heritage with instantly recognisable and loved logos art and vehicles,\u201d said Ian Mallalue, chief executive of TSBA. \u201cThis provides us with an opportunity to present London top the world using world-class British design.\u201d",

The cavalry arrived last week is the shape of retail veteran Archie Norman, who is to be its new chairman, and rising star Jill McDonald, poached from car parts and bike retailer Halfords, to oversee a clothing business which \u2013 despite its long-running problems \u2013 clings on to the title of being the UK\u2019s biggest. The appointments complete a changing of the management guard at the retailer, which began a year ago when Steve Rowe succeeded Marc Bolland as chief executive.

Also, after a relatively benign period, consumers are starting to feel the pinch as the weakness of sterling since the Brexit vote pushes up living costs. The internet is not going away either as shoppers reach for their smartphones rather than spend the day browsing in their local shops \u2013 a trend underlined by Next, which last week revealed that store sales had tumbled 8.1% over the past three months as purchases were transferred to its Directory home shopping business. During the six-year tenure of M&amp;S\u2019s current chairman Robert Swannell a lot has changed behind the scenes. He worked with Bolland on an expensive overhaul of the warehousing and IT system that is the backbone of stores, and also launched a new website that promises to be key to its future success. But analysts say he failed to tackle the thorny issue of the retailer\u2019s clothing arm, which has been losing ground to rivals including Next, Zara and Primark for most of the decade. This is reflected in the performance of M&amp;S\u2019s shares. When Swannell joined they were changing hands for 370p and on Friday they closed at 375p, after gaining 18p on the back of Norman\u2019s appointment. The former investment banker inherited a business the delivered profits \u00a3780m in 2011 but is handing over one expected to make just shy of \u00a3600m when it delivers its annual results later this month. Insiders say Norman and Rowe have established a rapport and that the 63-year-old City grandee would not have taken the job if he did not have confidence in his chief executive, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store in south London. Norman, who is feted for turnarounds including at Asda and ITV, is said to beaware of the challenges M&amp;S faces as it grapples with a 130-year high street legacy that includes more than 300 clothing stores and a food business that is showing early signs of losing momentum. \u201cArchie Norman is an excellent choice because he understands retail and quite frankly the company has drifted under Swannell,\u201d said one former M&amp;S director. \u201cI think history will say the Swannell years were a time when the company went backwards rather than forwards.\u201d M&amp;S\u2019s food halls have prospered as Britons\u2019 eating habits increasingly favour the convenience of its ready meals and treats. But selling clothing has only got harder, which makes the appointment of a fashion novice like McDonald \u2013 who has never worked in fashion retail \u2013 a surprising one. After a series of false dawns, some analysts are surprised by the risk implied by entrusting control of the important division to an executive with more experience of burgers and bikes after spending nearly a decade at McDonald\u2019s before joining Halfords. \u201cI was gobsmacked,\u201d said another former M&amp;S director of the decision to hire McDonald. \u201cWhen I saw it, I thought \u2018you are kidding me right\u2019? It\u2019s still the biggest clothing retailer in the UK, just about, so needs someone who understands clothing to do that job.\u201d But the executive said: \u201cI really hope it works because a strong M&amp;S makes for a strong high street and as a competitor I want them to succeed.

    "webTitle": "Brexit and energy: does \u2018taking back control\u2019 mean losing power?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Brexit spotlight swung last week away from the familiar cast of bankers quitting the City and coffee-shop chains worried about recruiting staff to the fate of the energy industry tasked with powering the economy when the UK leaves the EU. The loudest warnings came from MPs, peers, engineers and the industry itself over the impact that blocks to trade or freedom of movement would have on the nuclear and oil sectors. However, the UK\u2019s departure from the union also risks damaging urgent efforts to make the continent\u2019s energy systems greener and more efficient, an adviser to the head of the United Nations has told the Observer. Rachel Kyte, special representative on sustainable energy to UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said anything that hampered the global switch to lower carbon power would be regrettable. \u201cBrexit is at best a distraction, at worst a disruption of the need to continue to drive energy productivity across the UK and Europe \u2013 of having a much less energy-intensive economy and getting more productivity from each unit of energy, of having a cleaner energy system, of having much less use of carbon-intensive fuels,\u201d said Kyte. The former World Bank executive highlighted the increasing amount of renewable energy generation in the UK, which had led to what she branded \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d, such as the country\u2019s grid recently going a whole day without coal power. As Europe gets an increasing amount of power from wind, solar and hydro, Kyte said it was vital that Brexit did not harm the growing number of interconnector cables being built. \u201cWe are seeing the beginnings of a highly interconnected European market and there are benefits to the UK of being part of that, so one hopes that interconnectedness will not be affected,\u201d she said. From the power that keeps Britain\u2019s homes lit to the crude that keeps its cars running, here is how Brexit could affect the energy sector: Interconnectors At least eight cables are being laid under the sea or through the Channel Tunnel to trade power between the UK, Ireland, France, Belgium, Denmark and Norway, tripling the existing number of UK interconnectors. Billions of pounds are committed to the projects under way, and ones even further afield have been mooted, such as a cable to bring Iceland\u2019s volcanic power to the UK. The government hopes these interconnectors will continue to operate post-Brexit, and wants more beyond those planned already. \u201cThe ambitions are to go higher,\u201d business secretary Greg Clark recently told MPs, citing a UK-France connector approved in February as a sign that leaving the EU was not affecting investor confidence. A UK that is more reliant on the variable nature of wind and solar power would make such interconnectivity with other countries even more important, he said. Key to the future prospects for interconnectors will be whether the UK continues as a member of the EU internal energy market, in a similar fashion to Norway. Alternatives include tracking the EU regime without any formal arrangement, or striking a series of bilateral arrangements similar to those Switzerland has made with the bloc. Being outside the EU market would be worse, according to experts. Silke Goldberg, a lawyer at Herbert Smith Freehills, said: \u201cWhile the UK government is supportive of interconnectors, there are some concerns among investors that the economic case for new interconnectors in the Channel may be affected if the UK is not part of the internal energy market and electricity imports are subject to trade tariffs.\u201d Those building the cables, which are made from vast amounts of copper, appear undeterred. \u201cAs long as there is a need on both sides to do trade, there is not really a worst case I can see, as the interest is on both sides,\u201d said Auke Lont, head of the Norwegian state grid operator Statnett, which is building the world\u2019s longest undersea cable between the Norway and the UK. The North Sea Link interconnector is expected to mostly be used for exporting hydro power from Norway to the UK when complete in 2020, after Brexit, but will also export surplus wind power from Britain in the other direction. \u201cThe moral of the story is there is enough economic interest on both sides that it will easily withstand the fact that the UK now leaves the EU,\u201d Lont said. Nuclear The nuclear industry potentially stands to lose the most from leaving the EU. Buried in the small print of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill in January was the news that Britain would quit a vital atomic power treaty: Euratom, which underpins the transport of nuclear fuel and other materials across Europe. Last week saw a flurry of warnings from the industry, MPs and peers over the consequences of that decision. The nuclear trade body raised the prospect of disruption across the industry if alternatives are not in place within two years, urging ministers to avoid a \u201ccliff edge\u201d. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the difficulty was not the technicalities of putting in place new cooperation agreements with nuclear states or new inspection regimes for nuclear material, but the time window imposed by the article 50 process. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely pressing timeframe,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cWe\u2019ve already lost three months by the time the general election is factored in.\u201d Britain quitting the treaty has also raised doubts over the future of its involvement in research and development on nuclear fusion, a cleaner form of atomic power. The Joint European Torus (JET), a fusion research project at Culham in Oxfordshire, receives \u00a350m a year from Euratom. But the current contract runs out in 2018, halfway through Brexit talks. One way for the UK\u2019s nuclear industry to get back on the front foot after leaving would be to focus on a new generation of mini-reactors, according to a leading engineering body. \u201cPushing ahead on the demonstration and commercialisation of small modular reactors would be a key way for the UK to once again become a world leader in the field,\u201d said Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. But delays to a government competition to develop such reactors do not bode well. Carbon trading and renewables The government has given no hints on whether it will retain membership of the EU\u2019s flagship climate change regime, the Emissions Trading System. The carbon market currently costs industries such as oil, cement, and steel just under \u20ac5 per tonne of carbon they emit. The oil and gas industry are among the sectors seeking clarity on whether the UK will stay or go. Some experts think the market\u2019s links to EU institutions may mean an exit is inevitable. \u201cThe government has not announced plans to leave the ETS, although disputes are handled by the European court of justice, which may be a red line,\u201d said the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank. When Nick Hurd, the climate minister, was recently asked if the UK had an alternative lined up to the ETS, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re analysing it, as you\u2019d expect us to do.\u201d An obvious time to leave would be before the current phase of the scheme ends in 2019. On green energy, Clark maintains no decision has been taken on whether the UK will stick to the EU\u2019s renewable energy directive after leaving the union. But government sources have said that after Brexit the UK will probably scrap the EU target to get 15% of all energy from renewable sources by 2020. That would seem likely if the Tories win the general election. The UK has lobbied Europe in recent years in favour of carbon-cutting targets and against ones for renewables, to leave ministers free to pursue their preference to largely use new nuclear to meet climate goals, rather than wind or solar. Oil The big post-EU concern for the UK\u2019s ailing oil and gas industry is the prospect of new tariffs being imposed. Industry body Oil &amp; Gas UK warned last week that a hard Brexit, falling back on World Trade Organisation rules, would see trading costs almost double from \u00a3600m a year to \u00a31.1bn because of changing tariff rates. At best, trading costs might go down \u00a3100m if the UK can strike more favourable deals outside the UK. In a letter to Theresa May, the industry also stressed the international nature of its workforce, and called on the government to prioritise \u201cfrictionless access to markets and labour\u201d during Brexit talks.",

      "body": "<p>The Brexit spotlight swung last week away from the familiar cast of bankers quitting the City and coffee-shop chains worried about recruiting staff to the fate of the energy industry tasked with powering the economy when the UK leaves the EU.</p> <p>The loudest warnings came from MPs, peers, engineers and the industry itself over the impact that blocks to trade or freedom of movement would have on the nuclear and oil sectors.</p> <p>However, the UK\u2019s departure from the union also risks damaging urgent efforts to make the continent\u2019s energy systems greener and more efficient, an adviser to the head of the United Nations has told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>Rachel Kyte, special representative on sustainable energy to UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said anything that hampered the global switch to lower carbon power would be regrettable.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit is at best a distraction, at worst a disruption of the need to continue to drive energy productivity across the UK and Europe \u2013 of having a much less energy-intensive economy and getting more productivity from each unit of energy, of having a cleaner energy system, of having much less use of carbon-intensive fuels,\u201d said Kyte.</p> <p>The former World Bank executive highlighted the increasing amount of renewable energy generation in the UK, which had led to what she branded \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/21/britain-set-for-first-coal-free-day-since-the-industrial-revolution\" title=\"\">country\u2019s grid recently going a whole day without coal power.</a></p> <p>As Europe gets an increasing amount of power from wind, solar and hydro, Kyte said it was vital that Brexit did not harm the growing number of interconnector cables being built.</p> <p>\u201cWe are seeing the beginnings of a highly interconnected European market and there are benefits to the UK of being part of that, so one hopes that interconnectedness will not be affected,\u201d she said.</p> <p>From the power that keeps Britain\u2019s homes lit to the crude that keeps its cars running, here is how Brexit could affect the energy sector:</p> <h2>Interconnectors</h2> <p>At least eight cables are being laid under the sea or through the Channel Tunnel to trade power between the UK, Ireland, France, Belgium, Denmark and Norway, tripling the existing number of UK interconnectors. Billions of pounds are committed to the projects under way, and ones even further afield have been mooted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/11/iceland-volcano-green-power\" title=\"\">such as a cable to bring Iceland\u2019s volcanic power to the UK</a>.</p> <p>The government hopes these interconnectors will continue to operate post-Brexit, and wants more beyond those planned already.</p> <p>\u201cThe ambitions are to go higher,\u201d business secretary Greg Clark recently <a href=\"http://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/b0fd9808-9c5c-4565-83ea-5f7aa10def18?in=09:30:08\" title=\"\">told MPs</a>, citing a UK-France connector approved in February as a sign that leaving the EU was not affecting investor confidence. A UK that is more reliant on the variable nature of wind and solar power would make such interconnectivity with other countries even more important, he said.</p> <p>Key to the future prospects for interconnectors will be whether the UK continues as a member of the EU internal energy market, in a similar fashion to Norway. Alternatives include tracking the EU regime without any formal arrangement, or striking a series of bilateral arrangements similar to those Switzerland has made with the bloc.</p> <p>Being outside the EU market would be worse, according to experts. Silke Goldberg, a lawyer at Herbert Smith Freehills, said: \u201cWhile the UK government is supportive of interconnectors, there are some concerns among investors that the economic case for new interconnectors in the Channel may be affected if the UK is not part of the internal energy market and electricity imports are subject to trade tariffs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/05/interconnectors/giv-39023LZ1z5pXWtJ9/\" data-alt=\"Existing and proposed interconnectors\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/05/interconnectors/giv-39023LZ1z5pXWtJ9/\">Existing and proposed interconnectors</a> </figure>  <p>Those building the cables, which are made from vast amounts of copper, appear undeterred. \u201cAs long as there is a need on both sides to do trade, there is not really a worst case I can see, as the interest is on both sides,\u201d said Auke Lont, head of the Norwegian state grid operator Statnett, which is building the world\u2019s longest undersea cable between the Norway and the UK.</p> <p>The North Sea Link interconnector is expected to mostly be used for exporting hydro power from Norway to the UK when complete in 2020, after Brexit, but will also export surplus wind power from Britain in the other direction. \u201cThe moral of the story is there is enough economic interest on both sides that it will easily withstand the fact that the UK now leaves the EU,\u201d Lont said.</p> <h2>Nuclear</h2> <p>The nuclear industry potentially stands to lose the most from leaving the EU. Buried in the small print of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill in January was the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2016-2017/0132/en/17132en.pdf\" title=\"\">news that Britain would quit a vital atomic power treaty</a>: Euratom, which underpins the transport of nuclear fuel and other materials across Europe.</p> <p>Last week saw a flurry of warnings from the industry, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/02/britains-energy-supply-is-in-jeopardy-after-brexit-warn-mps\" title=\"\">MPs</a> and peers over the consequences of that decision. The nuclear trade body raised the prospect of disruption across the industry if alternatives are not in place within two years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/02/nuclear-industry-uk-brexit-euratom-hinkley-point-c-nia\" title=\"\">urging ministers to avoid a \u201ccliff edge</a>\u201d. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the difficulty was not the technicalities of putting in place new cooperation agreements with nuclear states or new inspection regimes for nuclear material, but the time window imposed by the article 50 process.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely pressing timeframe,\u201d he told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cWe\u2019ve already lost three months by the time the general election is factored in.\u201d</p> <p>Britain quitting the treaty has also raised doubts over the future of its involvement in research and development on nuclear fusion, a cleaner form of atomic power. The Joint European Torus (JET), a fusion research project at Culham in Oxfordshire, receives \u00a350m a year from Euratom. But the current contract runs out in 2018, halfway through Brexit talks.</p> <p>One way for the UK\u2019s nuclear industry to get back on the front foot after leaving would be to focus on a new generation of mini-reactors, according to a leading engineering body.</p> <p>\u201cPushing ahead on the demonstration and commercialisation of small modular reactors would be a key way for the UK to once again become a world leader in the field,\u201d said Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/02/alarm-sounded-over-delays-to-develop-uk-mini-nuclear-reactors\" title=\"\">delays to a government competition to develop such reactors</a> do not bode well.</p> <h2>Carbon trading and renewables</h2> <p>The government has given no hints on whether it will retain membership of the EU\u2019s flagship climate change regime, the Emissions Trading System. The carbon market currently costs industries such as oil, cement, and steel just under \u20ac5 per tonne of carbon they emit. The oil and gas industry are among the sectors seeking clarity on whether the UK will stay or go.</p> <p>Some experts think the market\u2019s links to EU institutions may mean an exit is inevitable. \u201cThe government has not announced plans to leave the ETS, although disputes are handled by the European court of justice, which may be a red line,\u201d <a href=\"http://eciu.net/assets/Reports/ECIU_brexit_briefing_background.pdf\" title=\"\">said the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit</a> thinktank.</p> <p>When Nick Hurd, the climate minister, was recently asked if the UK had an alternative lined up to the ETS, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re analysing it, as you\u2019d expect us to do.\u201d An obvious time to leave would be before the current phase of the scheme ends in 2019.</p> <p>On green energy, Clark maintains no decision has been taken on whether the UK will stick to the EU\u2019s renewable energy directive after leaving the union. But government sources <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/14/britain-preparing-scrap-eu-green-energy-targets-part-bonfire/\" title=\"\">have said</a> that after Brexit the UK will probably scrap the EU target to get 15% of all energy from renewable sources by 2020. That would seem likely if the Tories win the general election.</p> <p>The UK has lobbied Europe in recent years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/02/uk-eu-renewables-targets\" title=\"\">in favour of carbon-cutting targets and against ones for renewables</a>, to leave ministers free to pursue their preference to largely use new nuclear to meet climate goals, rather than wind or solar.</p> <h2>Oil</h2> <p>The big post-EU concern for the UK\u2019s ailing oil and gas industry is the prospect of new tariffs being imposed.</p> <p>Industry body Oil &amp; Gas UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/03/hard-brexit-oil-gas-industry-wto-freedom-of-movement\" title=\"\">warned last week</a> that a hard Brexit, falling back on World Trade Organisation rules, would see trading costs almost double from \u00a3600m a year to \u00a31.1bn because of changing tariff rates. At best, trading costs might go down \u00a3100m if the UK can strike more favourable deals outside the UK.</p> <p>In a letter to Theresa May, the industry also stressed the international nature of its workforce, and called on the government to prioritise \u201cfrictionless access to markets and labour\u201d during Brexit talks.</p>",

So, after the company got caught paying workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Derbyshire warehouse less than the national minimum wage, Transline insisted: \u201cWe do not breach national minimum wage legislation\u201d \u2013 only to subsequently make some back payments to underpaid workers.</p> <p>The Sports Direct scandal ended up with a parliamentary hearing last summer, where MPs accused Transline of misleading them (not so, said the company). Still, the fallout led to rumours of problems for the business and on 28 March, Transline stated: \u201cThere is no imminent need for funds within the business\u201d \u2013 which looked odd when it then submitted court documents preparing the company for insolvency less than four weeks later.</p> <p>Company watchers expect some news on its future this week, so how is the firm calling it? \u201cWe have been involved in a number of negotiations, and are now at an advanced stage with one of the parties,\u201d it says. Nothing could possibly go wrong.</p>",
