    "webTitle": "RBS signals government could sell taxpayer stake next year", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has given the clearest signal yet that the government is preparing to sell off part of the taxpayer's stake in the bailed-out bank next year. As the Edinburgh-based bank reported a profit of \u00a3826m for the first quarter compared with a \u00a31.4bn loss the same time last year, its chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, said RBS could be ready for sale from the middle of 2014 \u2013 or even earlier. But the return to profit, and talk about a return to the private sector, did not impress the stock market. RBS shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, dropping 5.5% to 289p, a level that represents a \u00a319bn loss on the \u00a345bn ploughed in by the taxpayer during 2008 and 2009. The decision to sell the 81% stake rests with the Treasury and the disposal is expected to take place in a series of tranches over a number of years. Hampton used more definitive language about the prospects of a share sale than he did at the results in February, issuing a video message in which he said drawing up a prospectus for shareholders could be achieved from the middle of 2014. \"It could be earlier \u2026 we think the recovery process will be complete in about a year or so's time,\" he said. A prospectus contains all the details about the bank's financial performance and would be needed to be sent to prospective shareholders if the shares are to be sold off. An uncharacteristically upbeat Stephen Hester, who became RBS chief executive at the time of the October 2008 banking crisis, said the group was \"back in profit \u2026 a big change on recent times\". Some \u00a3900bn has been taken off the bank's balance sheet which was \u00a32.3tn at the time of its bailout. But Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"We were quite bemused listening to RBS management describe the business as 'ready for privatisation in 12 months'. It is ready now \u2013 it was ready three years ago \u2013 surely the only issue we are actually discussing here is the price.\" The average share price at which taxpayers bought the stake in the bank was around 500p, although a figure has since emerged of 407p, which was the average price of the shares on the stock market on the days the shares were bought. Hester, who described the possibility of privatisation as a \"terrific thing for the country\", conceded that some of the share sales could take place at a loss. \"There may well be a cogent case for starting at a lower price but I believe the average price can, and should, be above the government purchase price,\" Hester said. The slow economy and tougher regulations had made all bank shares less valuable, Hester said, but he insisted he was not complaining about the regulatory changes facing the industry. \"It is our view that privatisation would be a terrific thing for the country psychologically and in terms of taxpayers money be freed up for other needs,\" Hester said. The parliamentary banking standards commission could still call for the break-up of RBS into a good and bad bank. Such a decision should be for the government, Hester said, but he did not dismiss the idea out of hand. Even though RBS was back in profit, the City had been expecting a stronger performance and was surprised by the sharp downturn in the investment bank's profits. \"Underlying trends are weaker, with [group] operating profit of \u00a3800m \u2013 down 28% \u2013 a \u00a3400m consensus miss. The markets [investment bank] division [pre-tax profit down 64%] looks awful,\" said Gordon. Hester has been under political pressure to scale back the investment banking division and focus RBS on helping grow the domestic economy. The bank did not make an additional charge for payment protection insurance on top of the existing \u00a32.2bn it has set aside, although it ring-fenced an extra \u00a350m for insurance rate swap mis-selling. It is also falling behind in selling off the 316 branches that it has been instructed to by Brussels and signalled a stock market flotation of the branches under the revived Williams and Glyn's brand could take place in 2015. The bank is also still waiting to learn the size of any fine for money laundering offences in the US and warned it could have a \"material adverse affect\" on future results.",

Would you ignore the up-front hit and count the long-term blessing of living in a world where ownership of RBS looks more normal?

The Treasury is beating the drum towards early privatisation and RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton says a sale prospectus could be drawn up by the middle of next year. Meanwhile, chief executive Stephen Hester trumpets the \"psychological\" benefit for the nation and his employees if RBS is no longer routinely described as a ward of state. Before they all get carried away, at least two points should be remembered. First, we need to decide in what form RBS should be privatised. Almost everyone agrees now that it would have been better if RBS had been nationalised in full in 2008 and split into a good bank and bad bank to protect lending to the economy. Is it too late to pursue the idea? Would it be sensible to do so? Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of the England, is in favour of a good bank/bad bank split as the best way to return a healthy RBS to the private sector. And Andrew Tyrie's banking standards commission may hold forth when it makes its final report next month. Let's hear that debate. Would it be more profitable to park the bad assets with the state and allow them to be unwound over time? King has argued this method would minimise losses over the long-term. We should \"face up to reality\", he argued in March. Osborne disagrees. But where is the Treasury's cost/benefit analysis? Second, the price at which shares are sold matters. At the moment, the government is proceeding as if a loss of any size can simply be blamed on the last Labour administration, but it's not that simple. Yes, Labour paid too much in the midst of a crisis (it reverse-engineered the numbers during the capital injection so that the state's stake would be 82% and RBS would stay in touch with the stockmarket). But the current government is responsible for choosing the best moment to sell. Today RBS shares, at 289p, stand 42% below the purchase of 500p; in real money, that's a \u00a319bn loss on the \u00a345bn paid. And the book value is 459p, which is not an irrelevant figure since the hope must be that a fully scrubbed-up bank, making profitable loans, could get closer to a par valuation one day. Each 10p movement in RBS' share price is worth \u00a31bn. We're not talking loose change. The worry is that the government has decided that privatisation of RBS at any price, and in its current form, is a fine thing and should be done as quickly as possible. It smacks of an attempt to close down debate about the merits of restructuring RBS before its return to the private sector. Uplifted? No. \"Is there anything especially cool about Google's London offices?\" asks a \"frequently asked question\" on Google UK's website. The official answer is antique red telephone boxes, lightshades that look like bowler hats and so on. (Not everybody's idea of office chic, but to each his own). The unofficial answer is the miracle by which London-based staff who seem to be selling advertising space are actually doing nothing of the sort. It turns out they are merely encouraging a sale that takes place in Ireland. From the point of view of Google Inc, the US parent, that's definitely cool since the Irish subsidiary pays corporation tax at just 12.5%. A Reuters investigation this week highlighted Google's practice. The newsagency found British customers of Google who thought they were being sold advertising space by Google UK employees; it found London-based Google staff boasting on LinkedIn about their sales prowess; it noted another FAQ that said the 1,500-strong London office focuses on both website engineering and \"sales;\" and it recorded Google job ads seeking recruits for London with sales expertise. Common sense, then, suggests that a lot of advertising space is sold by the UK operation. Of course, Google may also be justified in saying \"we comply with all the tax rules in the UK\". But what that means, we assume, is that it has been able to satisfy the UK tax authorities that there's a difference between the business of facilitating a sale (in London) and making a sale and dispatching the invoice (in Dublin). Margaret Hodge's public accounts committee should not confine itself to recalling Google executive Matt Brittin to hear his verbal gymnastics again. It should also summon HMRC officials to explain why they seem to have approved an arrangement that defies any normal understanding of where the economic activity takes place. A lot of activity too: revenue of $18bn (\u00a311.5bn) from 2006 to 2011, says Reuters. Google is a company with high profit margins. If the current tax officials can't see that there's something wrong when all that revenue yields corporation tax of just $16m (\u00a310m), we need new tax officials. It was the most eye-catching debt issue of the week. No, not the record $17bn offer from Apple at minuscule rates of interest. Rather, it was the \u00a3800m issued by fashion chain New Look that best illustrates the frenzied hunt for yield among bond investors. By conventional yardsticks, New Look, a leveraged buyout from 2004, is still vastly over-borrowed nine years later. Its total debts of \u00a31.1bn tower over top-line operating profits (ie, before interest payments) of \u00a3198m. Yet, in a deal that replaces old debt with new debt, the group yesterday said it had secured its \u00a3800m by issuing five-year bonds in three tranches at an interest rate of roughly 8%. That's an astonishingly low rate given the state of the balance sheet and conditions on the high street. Better still for New Look, it has managed to get rid of half the payment-in-kind notes that can prove poisonous if held for too long. These were rolling up at a rate of 10% a year and had reached \u00a3746m. Well done, New Look \u2013 it has secured some breathing space. You have to wonder, though, where the corporate bond bubble is leading. It looks dangerous. So Bob wasn't driven by the money Remarkable revelations from Bob Diamond. He's only ever owned a 11-year-old Jeep, and he was never in it for the money. Hmm. On the first point, many of us would find it possible not to own a car if we enjoyed the arrangement described in Barclays 2011 annual report: \"Executive directors are provided with\u2026 the use of a company vehicle or the cash equivalent and the use of a company driver when required for business purposes.\" On the money point, it's a shame the former chief executive didn't speak up earlier. There was an almighty row about Diamond's \u00a32.7m bonus in 2011, which was opposed initially by the head of the pay committee, Alison Carnwarth, who belatedly resigned. She thought Diamond should have set an example by taking no bonus in a year of lousy profits. We must conclude other directors strong-armed Diamond into accepting the \u00a32.7m against his will.",

      "body": "<p>As leading shares jumped to their highest level since the middle of March following better than expected US jobs figures, mining group <strong>Glencore Xstrata </strong>made a positive start to life as a merged company.</p> <p>In their first day of trading, the new combined shares ended 12.8p higher at 343.95p or nearly 4%, helped by a rise in copper prices on hopes that central bank action to boost the global economy would lead to higher demand for commodities.</p> <p>The company said aggressive cost cutting meant it would beat its savings target of $500m, and added it would return excess capital to shareholders via dividends or buy-backs. Glencore dominates the combined group: out of 14 key positions, only two will be filled by former Xstrata executives.</p> <p>And although the company played down the idea it would be rushed into disposals, Chinese regulators demanded the sale of the Las Bambas project and analysts believe Xstrata's near 25% stake in platinum miner <strong>Lonmin</strong>, up 18p to 286.3p, and the Zanaga mine in the Republic of Congo could be on the block. John Meyer at SP Angel said:</p> <blockquote> Mick Davis' departure [as chief executive of] Xstrata is likely to see a clear out of assets which fit less well with the new Glenstrata strategy. <br> Davis' acquisition of [a stake in] Lonmin looked like a great idea at the time but labour unrest and the massacre at Marikana make the holding as unpalatable as a rattlesnake at a children's tea party. </blockquote> <p>Analysts at Numis were not convinced by the tie up however. They said:</p> <blockquote> After years of planning, Glencore has succeeded in incorporating Xstrata. Now the real work begins of combining a historically aggressive commodities trader with a major mining entity. Glencore now has a captive commodity stream with copper, zinc and especially coal assets held by Xstrata. The main benefit will be if it can tie up a single commodity and move the price to their advantage, something Xstrata was unable to do. <br> We believe there is an overall lack of synergies, reflect by the apparent lack of competition concern by the Chinese. The move is a big gamble on coal and with current weakness this could blow-up, especially in the short-term. Given recent cost inflation pressures, it is widely believed that at least a quarter of the coal operations on the East Coast of Australia are now unprofitable, which is why BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are diversifying these non-core assets. Glencore has instituted a 100-day integration plan with vast lay-offs in middle management expected. In the long term, these may not provide the savings they expect, especially if the technical base is reduced in an industry short of skills. If prices continue to be weak, then an overpriced deal at the top of the market will come back to haunt, something the other majors are suffering from. The jury is out. </blockquote> <p>Credit Suisse was more positive, starting coverage with an outperform rating and 400p target price:</p> <blockquote> We see synergy potential substantially above management guidance not priced in by the market which, together with industrial volume growth should drive peer-leading earnings growth over the next two years. With an entrepreneurial, returns-focused management team, free cash flows could improve significantly by 2015 aided by capex reductions (around $13bn to less than $7bn), higher operating cash flows and asset sales of $5bn-$10bn. </blockquote> <p>Other miners also gained ground, with <strong>Antofagasta</strong> adding 70.5p to 983p and controversial Kazakh miner <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> climbing 30.3p to 292.7p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished at 6521.46, up 60.75 points on the day and 95 points on the week.</p> <p>At this time every year market pundits trot out the old adage about selling in May and going away.

Government borrowing is currently strongly placed in financial markets. The strength of public finances is a key support to the rating despite the more pressing issue of population aging.</p> <p>Public finances remain robust compared to peers. This provides Finland with some scope to absorb unexpected shocks and is reflected in the Stable Outlook. At 53% of GDP in 2012, general government debt is in line with the 'AAA' median and well below eurozone rating peers, including Germany ('AAA'/Stable). While the government has acknowledged that it will fail to meet its objective to reduce the central government deficit to no more than 1% of GDP by 2015, Fitch expects debt to GDP will remain below the EU threshold of 60% of GDP during the remainder of the parliamentary term of the current administration.</p> <p>With pension fund assets over 70% of GDP the government has a net asset position, one of only six countries in the OECD and only second to Norway when measured relative to GDP. This is a mitigating factor towards the rising cost of an ageing population for the government for the short to medium term. The impact of an ageing population on public finances, however, will accelerate from 2020 and the government will need to implement further reforms of pensions to restore long run sustainability.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's the statement: <a href=\"http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=790388&amp;origin=home\">Fitch Affirms Finland at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5183e037e4b01a34b123f6ab\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-03T16:05:11.804Z\">5.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dax hits record high as markets rally</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Germany's <strong>DAX</strong> stock exchange has closed at its highest ever level, as the rally sparked by today's forecast-beating American jobs data.</p> <p><strong>The DAX jumped by 160 points, or 2%, to 8122 points.</strong></p> <p>Here's a graph showing how Europe's markets closed, and the latest details from Wall Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-79b6ba10-2c76-4b32-87a7-b327e11cf324\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/3/1367597083567/03d51ea7-09c0-4190-aeeb-5ebed460d9be-296x420.png\" alt=\"Stock markets closing prices, May 3 2013\" width=\"296\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As you can see, the S&amp;P 500 remains over 1,600 for the first time ever, while the Dow Jones has dropped back below 15,000 having hit its own intra-day record high earlier.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-05-03T16:49:49.986Z\">at 5.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5183d4cde4b0917c6345bc1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-03T15:16:29.197Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Greece, MPs are to decide whether the Golden Dawn MP accused of trying to pull a gun on the mayor of Athens should face charges.</p> <p>The parliament will be asked to consider whether to lift the immunity from prosecution of Giorgos Germenis, who is also said to have accidentally hit a 12-year girl in the face when trying to strike the mayor.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_03/05/2013_497245\">Kathimerini reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Athens public prosecutor was on Friday to forward the case file on Golden Dawn deputy Giorgos Germenis to Parliament so MPs can decide on whether to lift the extreme rightist's immunity and allow him to face charges in connection with the attempted assault on Thursday of Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis.</p> <p>Police forwarded the prosecutor the file on Germenis which relates to the charges of attempted bodily harm and verbal abuse.

      "bodyText": "It's all over in Europe, after a busy week. We've had May Day rallies, a Greek strike, the ECB monthly meeting, and more economic news (mostly bad) than I'd like to remember. A very brief recap of today's two main stories \u2022 The US labour market is recovering faster than we thought. Today's jobs data showed 165,000 new positions were created in April, with another February and March's total revised higher by 114,000 new jobs. See here onwards. \u2022 Europe's economy is in worse shape than the European Commission had previously admitted. The EC's new growth forecasts predict a 0.4% drop in GDP this year, and show that France and Spain will both miss the official deficit targets this year. Here's a summary from earlier. \u2022 Commissioner Olli Rehn also claimed that Britain had no flexibility to ease fiscal policy (see here) In other news \u2022 Markets have posted strong gains, with the German DAX closing at its highest ever level, and the US Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 both hitting record highs (see here) \u2022 ECB policy maker Ewald Nowotny suffered a nasty dose of over-interpretations over negative interest rates (see here) \u2022 Finland's AAA credit rating has been affirmed by Fitch (see here) \u2022 A MP representing the Greek nei-Nazi Golden Dawn party, who is accused of trying to pull a gun on the mayer of Athens (and punching a girl in the melee) could face charges. (see here). Have great weekends all. Thanks, and goodnight! Late news from the rating agencies -- Fitch has just affirmed Finland's AAA rating, with a stable outlook. Finland's rating is underpinned by a combination of strong governance, high income per capita, a positive net international investment position and an impeccable debt service record. Government borrowing is currently strongly placed in financial markets. The strength of public finances is a key support to the rating despite the more pressing issue of population aging. Public finances remain robust compared to peers. This provides Finland with some scope to absorb unexpected shocks and is reflected in the Stable Outlook. At 53% of GDP in 2012, general government debt is in line with the 'AAA' median and well below eurozone rating peers, including Germany ('AAA'/Stable). While the government has acknowledged that it will fail to meet its objective to reduce the central government deficit to no more than 1% of GDP by 2015, Fitch expects debt to GDP will remain below the EU threshold of 60% of GDP during the remainder of the parliamentary term of the current administration. With pension fund assets over 70% of GDP the government has a net asset position, one of only six countries in the OECD and only second to Norway when measured relative to GDP. This is a mitigating factor towards the rising cost of an ageing population for the government for the short to medium term. The impact of an ageing population on public finances, however, will accelerate from 2020 and the government will need to implement further reforms of pensions to restore long run sustainability. Here's the statement: Fitch Affirms Finland at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable Germany's DAX stock exchange has closed at its highest ever level, as the rally sparked by today's forecast-beating American jobs data. The DAX jumped by 160 points, or 2%, to 8122 points. Here's a graph showing how Europe's markets closed, and the latest details from Wall Street. As you can see, the S&amp;P 500 remains over 1,600 for the first time ever, while the Dow Jones has dropped back below 15,000 having hit its own intra-day record high earlier. In Greece, MPs are to decide whether the Golden Dawn MP accused of trying to pull a gun on the mayor of Athens should face charges. The parliament will be asked to consider whether to lift the immunity from prosecution of Giorgos Germenis, who is also said to have accidentally hit a 12-year girl in the face when trying to strike the mayor. Kathimerini reports: The Athens public prosecutor was on Friday to forward the case file on Golden Dawn deputy Giorgos Germenis to Parliament so MPs can decide on whether to lift the extreme rightist's immunity and allow him to face charges in connection with the attempted assault on Thursday of Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis. Police forwarded the prosecutor the file on Germenis which relates to the charges of attempted bodily harm and verbal abuse. According to witnesses, Germenis tried to punch Kaminis after the mayor asked police to stop Golden Dawn from distributing food in Syntagma Square on Thursday. The lawmaker's punch missed the mayor and hit a 12-year-old who had visited a municipal office where candles for Orthodox Easter were being distributed. She was not seriously hurt. Parliament must now decide whether to lift Germenis' immunity. The Dow Jones industrial average just broke over the 15,000 mark for the first time: Anyone who was quick to 'Sell in May' may be feeling a bit bruised. Two more gobbets of US economic data have landed - and they are not as good as the jobs report. New orders at US factories fell by 4.0% in March, a bigger-than-expected drop. And the monthly measure of the services sector showed that growth slowed in April to a nine-month low. The ISM non-manufacturing index fell to 53.1, down from 54.4 in March. Here's Capital Economics's take on the US jobs data: The better than expected 165,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in April, combined with the 114,000 upward revision to the gains in the preceding two months, will go a long way toward soothing fears of another spring slowdown. With the unemployment rate edging down to a four-and-a-bit-year low of 7.5%, the Fed may yet begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases sometime in the second half of the year. Wall Street is open, and shares are racing higher as traders welcome the better-than-expected jobs data. The S&amp;P 500 has broken above the 1,600 point mark for the first time ever, and the Dow Jones industrial average has jumped 154 points to 14985, + 1.05%. European stock markets are also jumping -- on optimism that America's economy is in better shape. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 80 points at 6541, +1.2% \u2022 German DAX: up 138 points at 8099, + 1.74% \u2022 French CAC: up 48 points at 3907, + 1.26% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 155 points at 16903, + 0.9% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 156 points at 8562, + 1.8% Now we just need to move this optimism into the real European economy.... Today's US unemployment data is also another reminder of how bad the situation in Europe has become. The eurozone's jobless rate has now hit 12.1%, and the EC expects it will average 12.2% this year (see this post from earlier today) The US jobs market is also looking healthier than the UK, where the unemployment rate hit 7.9% in the three months to February. Our Wall Street correspondent, Dominic Rushe, has filed his first news story on the US jobs data: US unemployment hits lowest rate in four years on strong April jobs figures World markets soar as monthly report blows past estimates, with 165,000 jobs added and a jobless rate of 7.5% Despite the strong payroll data, there was no jobs growth in America's construction or manufacturing sectors last month. Some detail on today's US jobs data: The 165,000 new jobs created in April were focused on these areas: professional and business services, food services and drinking places, retail trade, and health care. Tthe number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) has fallen by 258,000 to 4.4 million. But there are also two data points that may signal economic weakness: \u2022 The number of people working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job rose by 278,000 to 7.9 million... \u2022 ...and the average working week for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls decreased by 0.2 hours in April to 34.4 hours. And finally, the labour force participation rate -- the percentage of people who are either in work, or looking for it - was flat month-on-month at 63.3%. The news that the US economy created 165,000 new jobs in April, and that an extra 114,000 more jobs were created than we thought in March and February, has cheered the markets. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 54 points to 6513, up 0.8%. And Wall Street is expected to rally when trading begins in under an hour's time: The dollar is also rallying against other currencies, up 1% against the yen, as the US economy looks healthier than 20 minutes ago. You can read the details of the US jobs data here, on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website: Employment Situation Summary The better-than expected rise jobs data from the US has pushed down the unemployment rate to 7.5% in April, from 7.6% in March. Breaking: The US economy gained 165,000 new jobs in April. Beating forecasts. March's number has been revised higher to 138,000, from the 88,000 that was so disappointing. And February's non-farm payroll has also been revised higher, to 332,000 from 268,000. Screeching tires and the smell of burning rubber from Bratislava this afternoon. ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny has told reporters that his comments about Mario Draghi's comments on negative interest rates being over-interpreted have been (wait for it) over-interpreted. Nowotny said he was \"a bit astonished\" to see the euro rise this morning, after he said there was \"no short-term relevence\" to Draghi's statement yesterday that the ECB was technically ready to charge banks who left deposits with them (see 8.59am). Reuters has the new Nowotny comments: \"I was a bit astonished by the reaction of the markets to my comments concerning the deposit facility,\" Nowotny told reporters in Bratislava. \"What I wanted to make very clear is: yes, there has been of course a discussion about going into negative territory and we are open minded about it but it is nothing that has immediate effect,\" he said. \"That is what I really meant,\" he added. \"Not that it is something that has to be excluded in principle. It is just an ongoing discussion. We are open minded about it but it is not something that will lead to a short-term result.\" \"I felt overinterpreted by the markets,\" the Austrian National Bank head said. The euro is still trading above $1.31, a gain of almost half a cent today. If Nowotny feels over-interpreted again, I'm sure he'll let us know. Electionista has wrapped up the latest political polling data from Italy and Germany: In Italy: And in Germany: Excellent blogpost on yesterday's ECB press conference by @pawelmorski, City fund manager, on Mario Draghi's failure to announce any decisive new measures to help the weakest areas of the eurozone, and why the much-expected cut in interest rates really isn't enough. We know \u2013 in as much as we know anything in economics that that 25bps cut will not add sufficient liquidity where it is needed. It may pump up Bund prices, and even help property owners in Helsinki or Munich, but money is not flowing to the companies and individuals that need it at the periphery for sure, and increasingly to the semi-core. This is like calling the Fire Brigade and being put on hold with periodic \u201cYour Call Is Important to Us\u201d\u2018s. The conference unfolded in the manner of those 1960s sitcom marital scenes when the husband comes home on his Wedding Anniversary with some ragged daffodils bought at a petrol station and an extra-large Toblerone. At first the wife is indulgent, waiting for the curtain to be swept aside and the string quartet and banquet revealed (maybe those much-leaked plans to siphon funds to smaller firms?). Then, as incredulity turns to rage, the husband gets self-righteous and defensive. He has, after all, been slaving away all day for the money to pay for these delightful flowers and delicious treats; Quite! More here: Mario Draghi: Your Call Is Important To Us Here's RanSquawk's video preview of the US jobs data for April, due for release in 45 minutes. Marketwatch has also written a preview, here. It explains that economists expect another 135,000 new jobs were created last month, while \"another soft number would raise alarm\" Business Insider has rounded up some of the best analyst predictions: IT'S JOBS DAY IN AMERICA: Here's Everything You Need To Know To Get Ready So a quick recap of the key points from the EC's Spring Forecasts (see 10.08am for details) \u2022 The eurozone recession will be deeper. The EC now expects a 0.4% drop in GDP in 2013, revised down from 0.3%, and a 1.2% rise in 2014, down from 1.4%. \u2022 Unemployment will remain a crisis. The euro area rate is expected to rise to 12.2% in 2013, and be 12.1% in 2014. The EC also pointed to the risks of \"social cohesion\" from the jobless rates in some countries -- but continues to push for countries to lower their deficits to meet its stability and growth pact. \u2022 France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands will all remain in recession this year. \u2022 Spain and France will be given another two years to hit the EC's deficit targets. Both are on track to run deficits significantly over 3% of GDP this year (6.5% for Spain, 3.9% for France). \u2022 Britain hasn't got room to ease. The EC forecasts a deficit of 6.8% in the UK in 2013. According to Rehn, the UK's debt levels mean that: There is really no case for a discretionary fiscal loosening in the UK. \u2022 And Italy is only expected to trim its deficit to 2.9% of GDP this year. That suggesting little room for additional stimulus measures without breaching the 3% target. Martin Koehring, European Analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit fears that the EC has not cut its growth forecasts enough. The EIU predicts that eurozone GDP will shrink by 0.7% this year and only recover by 0.5% in 2014 (rather than Olli Rehn's forecast of -0.4% this year and +1.2% in 2014). Koehring fears that austerity programmes and the weak eurozone banking sector will be a bigger drag on growth than the EC believes: Although financial markets in the euro area have stabilised and country borrowing costs have remained low, ongoing fiscal austerity will continue to limit consumer and business spending in 2013-14. Banks also remain hesitant to lend and demand for credit is low; we expect this to remain the case despite the recent interest rate cut by the European Central Bank. Major downside risks even to our more downbeat forecast persist, particularly a deterioration of the euro zone debt crisis, highlighted by the uncertain situations in Cyprus and Italy. Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define think tank agrees: In the FT, Peter Spiegel focuses on the fact that Spain, France and the Netherlands are all expected to miss the target of bringing their deficts below 3% of GDP this year: Here's the story: EU economies to breach deficit limits as economic picture darkens Three of the eurozone\u2019s five largest economies will bust through EU-mandated deficit limits this year as the bloc\u2019s recession continues to deepen, according to highly anticipated European Commission forecasts published on Friday. In addition to the anticipated breaches by France, Spain and the Netherlands, the currency union\u2019s third-largest economy, Italy, will come within a hair\u2019s breadth of missing the limit of 3 per cent of economic output, with a 2013 deficit forecasted at 2.9 per cent. And in the Wall Street Journal, Matina Stevis points to the desperate state of the European jobs markets EU Paints Gloomier Picture for Economy Dire jobs conditions and a protracted drying-up of credit to households and businesses will keep Europe's economy in a deeper-than-expected contraction in 2013 and slow down its return to growth in 2014, the European Commission said in its spring economic forecasts Friday. The 27-nation European Union economy will shrink by 0.1% in 2013, the EU's executive said. Its winter forecast published in February had projected a 0.1% growth rate. The 17-member euro area will suffer a 0.4% economic contraction this year, while the earlier forecast was a 0.3% contraction. The spring forecasts mark a small-scale calibration of the winter ones, taking into account economic performance in the early months of the year. Unemployment will remain at historic highs, with the EU's jobless rate seen at 11.1% for this year and next. In the euro zone, 12.2% of the workforce will be out of work in 2013 and the situation will hardly get better in 2014, when the rate is seen at 12.1%. Greece and Spain will see record jobless rates of 27% this year, a vastly different story to Austria's unemployment rate, seen at 4.7% in 2013. Reuters newsflash: FRENCH FINMIN WELCOMES EU COMMISSION'S FLEXIBILITY ON DEFICIT TARGET That follows Olli Rehn's comments that it makes sense to give France two more years to get its deficit below 3% -- to 2015, rather than 2013. 12 months ago, the EC was predicting growth of 1% this year -- not the 0.4% contraction in today's forecasts, as Charles Forelle of the WSJ points out: Britain's high debt levels mean it cannot risk a fiscal stimulus, claims Olli Rehn. Asked about the UK economy at today's briefing, commissioner Rehn pointed to the fact that the level of public debt is likely to rise close to 100% next year (under the EU's calculations). There is really no case for a discretionary fiscal loosening in the UK It is important that the UK follows through with consistent fiscal consoliation... to reach a sustainable fiscal position. The EC expects the UK economy to \"improve gradually\" with 0.6% GDP growth this year, then 1.7% in 2014. Slovenia is unlikely to get its deficit below 3% as soon as planned, Olli Rehn says, and the EC would want to see new economic reforms in return for extending the deadline. Asked about whether Slovenia could avoid international help, Rehn said: The stock of problems is not as vast as for many other countries, while the trend is very negative Therefore Slovenia's economic situation is stilll manageable as long as decisive action is taken without delay. Speaking in Brussels, Olli Rehn has told reporters that the EC is prepared to give France and Spain two more years to get their deficits below 3% of GDP. Rehn said: For France and Spain is is very obvious that it is more reasonable to have a correction of the excessive deficit over another two years. But other countries, though, should stick to their existing plans Today's forecasts show that France is expected to run a deficit of 3.9% in 2013, and 4.2% in 2014. On Italy, Olli Rehn says that he has been speaking with the country's new finance minister, and is looking forward to receiving details of how Enrico Letta's government plans to meet its own deficit reduction targets. You can read the EC's new forecasts here: Spring 2013 forecast: The EU economy \u2013 slowly recovering from a protracted recession More details of the EC growth forecasts from the Brussels press pack: The EC sees no hope of early relief in the unemployment market. It predicts that the jobless rate in the eurozone will reach 12.2% for 2013, and 12.1% in 2014*. It added: While the risks to the economic outlook have become more balanced on the back of important policy decisions since last summer, downside risks remain predominant. Very high levels of unemployment in some Member States could affect social cohesion and become persistent if further reforms are not undertaken. * - updated The EC has also cut its forecast for growth in 2014, from 1.4% to 1.2%. So, a deeper recession (with a 0.4% drop in GDP this year) and a slower recovery next year. Breaking news: the European Commission has cut its growth forecasts for the euro area, and warned that unemployment levels in some regions are unacceptably high. In its Spring forecasts, the EC predicted that eurozone GDP would fall by 0.4% this year, worse than the 0.3% decline pencilled in previously. For bailed-out, buffeted Cyprus, the EC now predicts a 8.7% tumble in economic output this year. Lots more to follow... Over in Brussels, commissioner Olli Rehn is announcing the EC's new economic forecasts -- there's a live feed here. Punchy economic news in the UK - with the service sector growing at its fastest rate in eight months in April. Markit's PMI came in at 52.9, up from 52.4, while the measure of new orders was the strongest since last May. That's an encouraging signal for UK economic growth this quarter (after dodging recession in Q1). European sovereign debt is rising in value this morning, driving down borrowing costs across the region. Spain's 10-year bond yields have dropped below the 4% mark for the first time since 2010, while Italy's 10-year debt is yielding just 3.74%. Very little of note in the stock markets, with the FTSE 100, the DAX and the CAC basically flat. India cut its interest rate for the third time this year earlier today, in an attempt to stimulate the country's economy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered its key rate to 7.25% from 7.5%, but warned that it didn't see much opportunity for further easing. India cut its growth forecast to 5% earlier this year, from over 6%. But inflation is too high for the RBI to consider cutting much further -- with its consumer prices index recorded at 10.39% in March. In a statement the RBI said it: cannot afford to lower its guard against the possibility of resurgence of inflation pressures. India's other challenge is that it's running a sizable current account deficit, which jumped to a record of 6.7% (partly due to the cost of importing commodities such as oil). Indranil Pan, an economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank in Mumbai, reckons that it's fanciful to expect the RBI to revitalise India's economy alone: Rate cuts are not the answer to resolve growth problems. The push has to come from the government by cutting wasteful expenditure and improving infrastructure bottlenecks. Economist Shaun Richards wrote a nice piece about the challenges facing the Indian central bank, back in February: The Reserve Bank of India is taking quite a gamble with India\u2019s economic future Yesterday's ECB meeting still looms over the European markets today, with one of the Bank's governing council members trying to dampen talk that the ECB might impose a negative deposit rate on banks*. Ewald Nowotny reckons people got too excited about Mario Draghi's comment that the ECB was \"technically ready\" to cut its deposit rate into negative territory, from 0.0% today. Nowotny told reporters in Bratislava that: Markets have over-interpreted the discussion yesterday. Of course, this is one of many options. But it is not an option that is relevant in the near future and it would need many aspects to analyse ... side effects and psychological effects. So, this is nothing that is of short-term relevance. That's helped to send the euro popping back against the US dollar, up 0.3% this morning at just over $1.31. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone and the wider global economy. It's a quieter morning after the drama of yesterday, when the European Central Bank slashed borrowing costs to a record low of 0.5% and hinted at imposing negative interest rates on banks which stash money with it overnight. The big action will come this afternoon - when America reports its employment data for April. The non-farm payroll (always 'eagerly awaited') will give us a decent idea of how the world's largest economy is performing, particularly as last month's reading was extremely weak. All week, economists have been cutting their forecasts for how many new jobs were created in America. They started at 155,000, but now it's down to around 140,000. Another disappointing reading might well add to fears that America's economy has entered a softer patch, with analysts already expecting GDP growth to slow this quarter as the 'sequester' government cutbacks hit home. Meanwhile, there's lots of analysis and reaction from the ECB to wade through (more to follow), and the EC is releasing its new Spring Economic Forecasts. I'll also be watching the usual hotspots of action, such as Italy, Cyprus and Greece -- where there's outrage after a Golden Dawn MP apparently tried to pulled a gun on the Athens mayor and accidentally punched a 12 year old girl. I wish I was making that up, but as Kathimerini explains: A crackdown by municipal authorities on an attempt by extreme-right Golden Dawn to distribute free food in central Syntagma Square on Thursday prompted one of the party\u2019s MPs to attempt an assault on Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis during which the MP apparently tried to pull out a gun. According to witnesses, Giorgos Germenis tried to punch Kaminis after the mayor asked police to stop Golden Dawn from distributing food in Syntagma. Police were sent to the square early on Thursday and used tear gas to force members of Golden Dawn to retreat from the area, taking with them a refrigerated truck containing meat, potatoes and other food. A few hours after the police crackdown, Germenis visited the offices of City Hall\u2019s solidarity initiative, which happens to be close to Golden Dawn\u2019s old headquarters near Larissis railway station, while workers were giving Easter candles to children and their parents. Witnesses said the MP lunged at Kaminis and tried to punch him but hit a 12-year-old girl instead, leaving her with a lightly bruised forehead. According to municipal employees, and to Kaminis, Germenis had a gun in his trouser pocket and tried to pull it out but was stopped by security guards.",

      "bodyText": "Hopes that Britain's economy could be stabilising have been bolstered by data showing that services companies posted their strongest performance last month since the Olympics. Activity beat expectations with its strongest growth for eight months in the closely watched Markit/CIPS PMI survey of the UK's services sector, which accounts for 75% of GDP. At 52.9 the index for April was above economists' forecastsand well clear of the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction. The PMI data came as Olli Rehn, European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, warned that Britain cannot risk a fiscal stimulus programme because of high debt levels. \"There is really no case for a discretionary fiscal loosening in the UK,\" he said. The services report - which covers businesses such as transport, hotels and computing - followed forecast-beating results in the PMI surveys for the smaller construction and manufacturing sectors earlier this week, which has fanned hopes that the UK economy made a steady start in the second quarter of the year. \"The three UK PMI surveys collectively signalled the fastest rate of economic growth for eight months in April. The improvement reflected a strengthening upturn in service sector business activity, a return to marginal growth in the manufacturing sector and a near-stabilisation of construction,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. \"The surveys provide the first evidence that the faster than expected economic growth seen in the first quarter persisted at the start of the second quarter,\" he added, but noted the rate of GDP growth signalled by the PMIs \"remains frustratingly modest\". Official data last month suggests that after contracting at the end of 2012 the UK economy grew again in the first quarter of this year, beating expectations with a 0.3% expansion. The growth was eked out against the backdrop of unusually harsh weather and removed most fears that the UK had slipped back into recession. The services report, which covers a wide range of businesses such as transport, hotels and computing, showed the strongest rise in new work in almost a year as companies cited new products, better weather and increased overseas demand. There was also \"modest\" jobs growth in the sector, the report said. Economists said the stronger-than-expected activity reduced the chances the Bank of England would step in with more stimulus. The Banks's nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) meets next week to decide whether to inject more electronic cash into the economy by extending its programme of quantitative easing (QE). In further good news for the UK economy, data showed that personal and company insolvencies fell to a five-year low in the first quarter of the year. The number of people declared insolvent in England and Wales fell to 25,006 in the first three months of the year according to the Insolvency Service, 12.9% lower compared with a year earlier. Company liquidations meanwhile fell to 3,678, 18% lower than the first quarter of 2012. They were the lowest since the financial crisis took hold in 2008. \"Overall the trio of good PMIs this week largely draw the line under the discussion over any more QE from the MPC next week,\" said David Tinsley at BNP Paribas. \"It was going to be pretty hard for the three voting for more asset purchases to convince the rest in any case, with a GDP print for the first quarter very much in line with February inflation report forecasts.\" Warnings remained, however, that the UK faces many headwinds, including a squeeze on household finances and an uncertain global economic outlook. The services report also showed business confidence remained subdued, noted Martin Beck at Capital Economics. \"An improvement in April's CIPS/Markit report on services joined the upticks already seen in the manufacturing and construction surveys in suggesting the second quarter has got off to a good start,\" eh said. \"But even with these positive signs, there is still little indication of the economy breaking out of an environment of fairly insipid growth.\"",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone's recession will be even deeper than previously feared this year, the European commission has warned, as it slashed its outlook for crisis-stricken Cyprus and downgraded the prospects of the bloc's biggest economies. The EU's executive arm now expects GDP in the single currency zone to shrink by 0.4% in 2013, a sharper decline than its previous forecast for a drop of 0.3%. The recovery pencilled in for 2014 will also be slower than expected and the unemployment crisis in the eurozone will persist, the commission said in its spring forecasts. Painting a picture of subdued domestic demand and lacklustre investment, the commission slackened its deficit-cutting targets to help some countries focus more on jobs and growth. Speaking against the backdrop of record high eurozone unemployment, the economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, said the commission was now prepared to give France and Spain two more years to get their deficits below 3% of GDP. \"France badly needs to unlock its growth potential and create jobs,\" he said, warning that the pace of economic activity in the eurozone was too slow to cut unemployment. With that in mind, he gave France and Spain greater leeway. \"For France and Spain it is very obvious that it is more reasonable to have a correction of the excessive deficit over another two years,\" Rehn said. Germany will be the only one of the area's five largest economies to escape recession this year and even its prospects were downgraded to growth of 0.4% from 0.5%. France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands are all expected to shrink. The sharpest revision was reserved for Cyprus, which the commission now sees contracting by 8.7% this year, from a 3.5% drop forecast in the commission's winter outlook in February \u2013 before the island was forced into a bailout led by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the EU. Unemployment on the troubled Mediterranean island is expected to be 15.5% this year and rise even further to 16.9% next year. \"Reduced business activity, possible spillovers from the restructuring of the banking sector to professional business services and the hiring freeze in the public sector are expected to push the unemployment rate higher in 2013 and more so in 2014,\" the commission said in its report, referring to the consequences of a bailout that included a raid on savers' deposits. The spring forecasts underlined the stark contrasts between eurozone member states, with France becoming decoupled from Germany as the economic centre of the single currency bloc. The commission sees the German economy recovering gradually on the back of improving domestic demand, helped by a \"robust labour market and more dynamic wage growth\". GDP in France, however, is forecast to stagnate this year amid modest exports. Eslewhere among the eurozone's largest economies, GDP in Italy is set to decline again in 2013, as reduced disposable incomes, low confidence and difficult financing conditions continue to weigh on consumption and investment. In Spain, the correction of pre-crisis imbalances \"remains a strong drag on domestic demand\" and the Netherlands is expected to shrink as the housing market and low disposable income hit consumption. The forecast of a 0.1% contraction in GDP for France contrasts with the government's own prediction of growth of 0.1%. The commission expects that the gloomy prospects for France mean it will run a deficit of of 3.9% of GDP in 2013, and 4.2% in 2014. Rehn said Paris was \"overly optimistic\" on growth as he granted an extension on the deadline originally set for this year to get the budget deficit under 3%. France said it would meet that target by 2014. The increased headroom for France and Spain will be welcomed by politicians and campaign groups pushing for a moveaway from austerity towards stimulating growth and employment. The commission's spring forecasts touched on the risks of failing to drive down unemployment, which it sees hitting 12.2% in the eurozone this year, up from 11.4% in 2012. \"While the risks to the economic outlook have become more balanced on the back of important policy decisions since last summer, downside risks remain predominant. Very high levels of unemployment in some member states could affect social cohesion and become persistent if further reforms are not undertaken,\" it said.",

Rehn said Paris was \"overly optimistic\" on growth as he granted an extension on the deadline originally set for this year to get the budget deficit under 3%. France said it would meet that target by 2014.</p> <p>The increased headroom for France and Spain will be welcomed by politicians and campaign groups pushing for a moveaway from austerity towards stimulating growth and employment.</p> <p>The commission's spring forecasts touched on the risks of failing to drive down unemployment, which it sees hitting 12.2% in the eurozone this year, up from 11.4% in 2012.</p> <p>\"While the risks to the economic outlook have become more balanced on the back of important policy decisions since last summer, downside risks remain predominant. Very high levels of unemployment in some member states could affect social cohesion and become persistent if further reforms are not undertaken,\" it said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The activities of large energy suppliers were under the spotlight again on Friday when Ofgem, the industry regulator, confirmed that it would levy a \u00a310.5m fine on SSE for mis-selling. The penalty, the largest the watchdog has imposed, was levied for numerous breaches of SSE's obligations relating to telephone, in-store and doorstep sales activities. It is the second time in less than two years that the utility has been found guilty of misleading customers on the doorstep and comes just 48 hours after Ofgem announced it was investigating SSE and five other suppliers about their failure to meet energy efficiency targets. In the latest mis-selling case the contraventions involved \"the use of misleading scripts\" by both telesales agents, while also failing to give \"accurate estimates and comparisons to customers\". SSE said it had \"nothing further to say\" about the fine but confirmed it would pay up by the 17 July deadline. When the penalty was first proposed earlier this month, the company said it was \"deeply regretful that breaches occurred and apologises unreservedly to any customers\". SSE pointed out that a large number of the breaches referred to activity undertaken between October 2009 and July 2011 \u2013 the point at which SSE suspended its doorstep sales operations in Britain. But the Ofgem confirmation notice also made reference to the fact that in May 2011 SSE was found guilty of \"misleading commercial practice\" in relation to doorstep-selling activities between 2008 and 2009. SSE, British Gas and Scottish Power are among six energy companies that are to become the subject of an investigation by Ofgem into their failure to reach UK carbon reduction targets. British Gas could face a large fine after missing one target by nearly 40%. Meanwhile another of the big six energy companies, npower, is facing the threat of a consumer boycott. More than 170,000 people have now signed a petition calling on the German-owned business to pay more tax in Britain.",
