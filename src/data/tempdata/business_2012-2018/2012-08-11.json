      "bodyText": "Consumers are being warned that the price of bacon will rise significantly next year as European producers quit the industry ahead of new laws governing animal welfare. The predicted decline in the number of European producers comes while many of their counterparts in the UK industry, who account for 40% of all domestic bacon sales, are battling to stay in business. Last week British pig farmers mounted a publicity drive to encourage consumers to buy British pork products. The National Pig Association warned that farmers who are responsible for as much as 10% of all British pig production will be forced to leave the industry by Christmas. The association blamed poor crop-growing conditions, particularly in the US, for a 25% rise in the cost of pig feed ingredients, which has meant many producers are unable to turn a profit. It claims that, if British pig farmers continue to leave the industry, around 1.5m rashers of British bacon and 2.3m British sausages a week will disappear from supermarket shelves. Sharp rises in pig feed prices are not new. There have been spikes in 2008 and 2011 due to poor weather. \"But what we are seeing now is a fundamental shift in grain prices going upwards,\" said NPA general manager Dr Zoe Davies. For the British consumer, soaring feed prices may not be a problem in the short term. High street rivalry is making supermarkets reluctant to pay farmers more to cover their extra costs of production. And empty spaces on supermarket shelves, caused by British producers quitting the industry, can be filled with imported bacon and sausages, which are often cheaper than British alternatives but do not adhere to stringent welfare standards. However, a partial ban on sow stalls, due to take effect throughout Europe from 1 January 2013, will have a major impact on the EU pig meat market, according to experts. BPEX, the body that represents the interests of pig producers, said that similar animal welfare legislation, which came into force at the start of this year, has caused serious disruption with the price of eggs up 75% compared with a year ago. BPEX warns that pig production is likely to fall by between 5% and 10% with the result that retailers will be face substantial price increases. Only three EU member states have reported that they comply with the new legislation. Several have already indicated that they expect a \"significant number\" of their producers to stop breeding pigs or allow their herds to run down. \"In the past, the UK was 40% self-sufficient for pork and 60% came from elsewhere,\" Davies said. \"But that is no longer going to be the case. We could soon see pork being imported from South America or Thailand if British producers go out of business.\"",

The Observer understands that the Olympic Security Group (OSG), the elite body with overall responsibility for the policing of the Games, wrote to the Home Office last week outlining a series of \"learning points\" that needed to be addressed before the UK stages another major sporting event. The group expressed concern that there was no independent regulator of G4S, which meant its progress in meeting targets leading up to the Games had gone largely unmonitored until it was almost too late to take action. \"It meant there was nobody who could press a panic button,\" explained a source familiar with the group's thinking. The OSG also said the fact that there were no cancellation clauses in G4S's contract also made it difficult to hold the company to account. It acknowledged that there had been warnings that G4S would not be able to deliver on its promises since the beginning of the year and noted that there had been a number of minor problems involving the company's personnel during the Games. Trade unions said the group's findings showed there was a need for greater oversight of private firms that were awarded public-sector contracts. \"Whenever the private sector gets it wrong in the justice sector, it is the public sector that bails it out,\" said Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union, Napo. \"With the private sector, it's always a race to the bottom.\" However, the OSG was more positive about the overall level of security at the Games. It notes that the torch procession and opening ceremony set an early goodwill precedent for the Olympics that continued to flow through the Games themselves. \"It meant it was clear from the outset that there would be no public support for any group who tried to exploit the Games for their advantage,\" the source said. Prior to the Olympics, the police's biggest fear had been that anti-capitalism protesters would stage a series of high-profile stunts aimed at causing public disorder. However, the report expresses satisfaction that there have been no serious breaches of security. Ironically, it suggests that the presence of the army may have helped matters. Bringing in respected military personnel bolstered public support, the OSG believes.",

Lawsky is head of New York's recently created financial services regulator, which operates out of the attorney general's office. This office has form. The two previous attorney generals, Eliot Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo, both became governor thanks largely to their insatiable appetite for bringing down the wrongdoers of Wall Street. Before his downfall Spitzer earned the moniker \"the sheriff of Wall Street\" as he exposed a host of institutions, including Merrill Lynch for mis-selling products to clients that it's own analysts knew would fail. Cuomo, meanwhile \u2013 with Lawsky in his inner circle of advisers \u2013 accused Bank of America executives of fraud, claiming that during the takeover of Merrill Lynch they hid billions of dollars in losses at the firm from shareholders. After the takeover Bank of America, which denies the allegations, received a second bailout from Washington. The nickname Ben \"long-arm-of-the\" Lawsky is already gaining currency. The 42-year-old keen marathon runner is the grandson of immigrants from Nazi Germany. He was born on a navy base in San Diego before moving to Pittsburgh, where he grew up with his twin sister. Originally hoping to become an architect, he switched to law, graduating with honours from Columbia Law school. Afterwards he took up a clerk's position with two Republican federal judges before moving to Washington to work in the Justice Department. He first made a name for himself in 1999 as counsel to a Democrat senator, where he honed his skills of delicately balancing policy, politics and the press, feeding interesting stories with fiery language to Capitol Hill's hungry journalists. Later he became a New York prosecutor, gaining a fearsome reputation for prosecuting terrorists, drugs barons and public officials with an aggression more suited to a Hollywood courtroom drama. It was here that he got his first taste for Wall Street blood after prosecuting an insider-trading scheme that involved using advance copies of Businessweek from the printing presses, tips from a Merrill Lynch analyst and insider knowledge on a Reebok takeover before it was public. In 2006 he could have followed the path of fellow lawyers and gone into the private sector, but instead he joined the then attorney general Cuomo. He quickly rose through the ranks to eventually become Cuomo's chief of staff. When Cuomo became New York governor last year, Lawsky could have moved on with him, but stayed where he was.

      "bodyText": "I couldn't help but cynically raise my eyebrows when Benjamin Lawsky, the state of New York's first superintendent of financial services, claimed Standard Chartered was a rogue institution for breaching sanctions on Iran. It was not because I have an informed view on whether or not Standard Chartered has been acting in such a grossly negligent fashion, but due to the fact that New York politicians have a long history of building their political careers off the backs of prosecuting the banking industry for misdeeds. The risk departments of all banks operating in the US zone are well aware of this fact and routinely report that such prosecutions could take place.So I guess Labour MP John Mann's suggestion that US regulators are out to get London as the world financial capital, in order to build up New York's reputation, has to be viewed with an equal measure of scepticism. Probably the better question for everyone is to ask: is it possible for cultures of big global banking groups to operate to a singular good business agenda? If not, is the enormous size of the banks that have caused so much havoc another reason to consider breaking up the large banks so that they can concentrate on performing certain financial services functions to the highest standards possible? What the various US regulators' investigations into Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered have in common is that they involve numerous businesses operating all over the world. HSBC and Standard Chartered have found themselves in trouble through some of their subsidiary companies that have transacted business through the US. It is one thing to operate a bank in a single jurisdiction and comply with that country's regulations and law, but global businesses operating in a multitude of jurisdictions have an extraordinary web of requirements and legal codes to acknowledge in their decision-making. In my own career, the senior and mid-level management debates about how to comply with certain regulatory and standards began more than 20 years ago as many OECD-member nations and others began the first stages of a crackdown on banks used to launder drug money and proceeds of other crimes. More than 10 years ago sanctions against helping certain countries such as Iran carry out day-to-day business in the global financial markets became part of our working lives too, as did watch lists of politically exposed individuals. When these actions began in the 1990s, bankers would complain that it was insulting to ask a client for identification. They would say it was impossible to verify the address of residents of the Middle East because they only had post office boxes. Knowing the source of a client's funds became a huge issue and still is because money launderers are sophisticated and know the loopholes, and impatient bankers just want the accounts open so that business can be conducted and they can, in turn, earn bonus revenue. But still, any banking leader working in this industry for more than 20 years should be able to see that they can only earn revenue from good business and should have been actively working to shed themselves of any dodgy money associated with corruption, crime and terrorism. While not all the jurisdictions have exactly the same regulations and laws, regulators and lawmakers in financial centres from New York to London, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Sydney, Johannesburg, as well as a number of smaller jurisdictions have all been saying: \"Banks, you are not above the law, you must make your businesses comply with our requirements \u2013 there is no debate \u2013 otherwise there will be consequences.\" I am certain that regulators are now looking at the global operations of big banks to make certain they have everyone operating to the highest standard. This is all the more reason why such large businesses might consider selling off or closing down the business lines that are too difficult to make compliant, no matter the consequence to a bank's income.

If not, is the enormous size of the banks that have caused so much havoc another reason to consider breaking up the large banks so that they can concentrate on performing certain financial services functions to the highest standards possible?</p> <p>What the various US regulators' investigations into Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered have in common is that they involve numerous businesses operating all over the world. HSBC and Standard Chartered have found themselves in trouble through some of their subsidiary companies that have transacted business through the US.</p> <p>It is one thing to operate a bank in a single jurisdiction and comply with that country's regulations and law, but global businesses operating in a multitude of jurisdictions have an extraordinary web of requirements and legal codes to acknowledge in their decision-making. In my own career, the senior and mid-level management debates about how to comply with certain regulatory and standards began more than 20 years ago as many OECD-member nations and others began the first stages of a crackdown on banks used to launder drug money and proceeds of other crimes. More than 10 years ago sanctions against helping certain countries such as Iran carry out day-to-day business in the global financial markets became part of our working lives too, as did watch lists of politically exposed individuals. When these actions began in the 1990s, bankers would complain that it was insulting to ask a client for identification. They would say it was impossible to verify the address of residents of the Middle East because they only had post office boxes. Knowing the source of a client's funds became a huge issue and still is because money launderers are sophisticated and know the loopholes, and impatient bankers just want the accounts open so that business can be conducted and they can, in turn, earn bonus revenue.</p> <p>But still, any banking leader working in this industry for more than 20 years should be able to see that they can only earn revenue from good business and should have been actively working to shed themselves of any dodgy money associated with corruption, crime and terrorism. While not all the jurisdictions have exactly the same regulations and laws, regulators and lawmakers in financial centres from New York to London, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Sydney, Johannesburg, as well as a number of smaller jurisdictions have all been saying: \"Banks, you are not above the law, you must make your businesses comply with our requirements \u2013 there is no debate \u2013 otherwise there will be consequences.\"</p> <p>I am certain that regulators are now looking at the global operations of big banks to make certain they have everyone operating to the highest standard. This is all the more reason why such large businesses might consider selling off or closing down the business lines that are too difficult to make compliant, no matter the consequence to a bank's income.</p> <p><em>Robert Taylor is a member of several corporate and institutional boards and former chief executive of Kleinwort Benson</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "At mid-morning a text message interrupted Peter Sands on his Canadian holiday. The boss of Standard Chartered had just begun his summer break and was relaxing after presenting yet another set of record half-year profits to the City. That an American regulator had accused the bank of breaching financial sanctions against Iran was a bolt from a blue. It was Monday and there were just minutes of trading left in London when the report, which claimed that the bank had helped Iranian clients avoid US sanctions in 60,000 transactions worth $250bn (\u00a3160bn), landed. For several years Standard Chartered, a bank which had pulled through the financial crisis with a remarkably squeaky clean reputation, had been telling shareholders in its annual reports that it was \"in discussions\" with American regulators about \"historic\" sanction breaches. But the nature of the allegations made by the state of New York's department of financial services (DFS) were extraordinary. Despite the tiny trading window, the bank's shares lost 6% of their value on Monday, and by Tuesday morning were in freefall, losing nearly a quarter of their value at one stage, as investors ditched the stock amid fears that the bank could lose its crucial banking licence in New York. It is the latest sorry chapter in what has been a bad year for London's Square Mile, which is still digesting the record fine meted out to Barclays for attempting to rig Libor and the fulsome apology from HSBC, which admitted helping Mexican drug barons launder money. Just a week ago Standard Chartered had boasted it was too \"boring\" for scandals and if evidence were needed that Sands, Standard's group chief executive, and his top managers were unaware of the ambitious New York regulator Benjamin Lawsky was preparing to land, it lay in the fact that it took them an agonising eight hours to respond. Standard Chartered insisted that 99.9% of its transactions had been lawful and apologised that just under 300, worth a total of $14m, had breached the rules. Meanwhile investors used that time to pore over the report and it didn't look pretty, not least the tough talk attributed to a senior Standard Chartered executive who gave a New York colleague worried about sanctions busting, memorably short shrift: \"You fucking Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians?\" It didn't take them long to figure out that the diatribe was supposed to have been uttered by Richard Meddings, now the bank's highly regarded finance director. The bank insists that the quotation is inaccurate. By Tuesday, Sands was on an aircraft back to London, leaving his holiday with his in-laws and returning to the bank's head office to begin the fightback that is crucial not just to savage his own reputation but to help restore the battered fortunes of the City itself. In New York, where the bank's chairman, Sir John Peace, had flown to meet the bank's lawyers, the episode is held up as yet another example of the City of London's rotten core. \"It seems to be that every big trading disaster happens in London,\" US congresswoman Carolyn Maloney told the house financial services committee as it investigated JP Morgan's massive London losses earlier this summer. Ironically, until the 2008 banking crisis, London was being held up by US politicians as a model of financial dynamism. \"Go back to 2005, 2006 and London was the envy of New York,\" said Peter Henning, Wayne State University law professor. London had lighter regulation and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) was regarded as \"toothless\", a trait which Henning said was admired by Wall Street bankers. Meanwhile, Michael Bloomberg, New York's mayor, and New York senator Charles Schumer were warning that the city was being \"stifled by stringent regulations\" brought in after the Enron scandal. As Henning pointed out, much of the \u2013 admitted and alleged \u2013 misconduct at Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered happened during this envied period of \"light-touch\" regulation. \"Well now I think we are probably seeing the consequences,\" he added. With the City's regulatory framework being tightened by the coalition government, which is disbanding the FSA and handing control of bank oversight to the Bank of England, there is concern in London that the US politicians are being opportunistic. As well as the DFS, Standard Chartered is in discussions with four other agencies, including the treasury department's office of foreign assets control, but it seems that Lawsky broke ranks without informing the other agencies . Labour MP John Mann, no friend of the banking set, feared \"an increasing anti-British bias by US regulators and politicians aimed at shifting financial markets from London to New York\". Even Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King waded in to say that the UK authorities hoped the various US regulatory bodies would work together while chancellor George Osborne sought assurances from US treasury secretary Tim Geithner that Standard Chartered would be treated fairly, given that US regulators usually work on settlements together. \"There's an election coming and Wall Street versus Main Street is very much going to be part of the debate,\" said James Cox, Duke University law professor. \"It's far safer for a politician to pick on some foreign bank than it is to pick on Citigroup.\" Washington is on holiday now, but before setting off for their summer homes, the politicians started preparations for what could be an autumn of British bank-bashing. Both the senate banking committee and the house financial services committee are looking into Libor. Barclays former boss Bob Diamond, who quit in the wake of the interest-rate rigging scandal, could be called to testify. Lawsky's DFS does not take holidays and Standard Chartered has been summoned to a hearing at 10am in New York on Wednesday to explain why it should be allowed to keep its banking licence. Speculation was rife this weekend that the hearing could be postponed to allow the US regulators to work together to try and complete a joint settlement. Sands and the bank's lawyers will spend the weekend poring over the allegations, which they insist contain numerous factual inaccuracies. Last week the measured Sands admitted the accusations had been \"very damaging \u2026 we are going to have to work hard to restore the damage\". At stake is not only his reputation but that of Meddings, the bank, and arguably the entire City.",

      "bodyText": "First the good news: this government is disintegrating. Second, the bad news: the disintegration will take some time, and meanwhile even more economic and social damage is likely to be wreaked on a public that by now ought not to be quite as unsuspecting as it was. The Olympics have, of course, been a wonderful diversion from the harsh reality that will soon return. Those of us who never got our act together to abandon the metropolis for the duration of the Games are thanking our lucky stars. The Liberal Democrats are thanking neither the stars nor their coalition \"partners\". They have plainly been taken for a ride. In their desperation to achieve their reform of the House of Lords they entered into a Faustian pact with the Conservatives. In the process, they allowed themselves to be frightened by the Treasury and the Bank of England into believing that the British economy's financing problems were on a par with those of Greece. Right from the beginning a handful of commentators, including your own correspondent, tried to warn them that this was far from the case; that the British debt position was one of the strongest in the western world; and that a deficit reduction programme was a worthy goal when an economy was growing fast, but likely to delay such a recovery if embarked on prematurely. Indeed, when the economy is depressed, and business and the general public (we so-called consumers) are cutting back, the only way to prevent the situation from becoming worse is for the public sector to fill the gap, not to make it even bigger. \"Healey's Law\" has been quoted before in this column and is worth repeating. It goes as follows: \"When you are in a hole, don't dig any deeper.\" As for all that public sector borrowing, it is being done at negligible interest rates \u2013 much lower than the rate at which the private sector can borrow for all those \"private\" infrastructure initiatives the government is doctrinally trying to encourage. As Robert Stheeman, head of the UK Debt Management Office, observes: \"It's extraordinary. If you had told me just a few years ago how low they [the UK's borrowing costs] could go, I wouldn't have believed you.\" Stheeman has always been confident of the strength of the UK's position, often pointing to the very long average maturity of the debt (some 14 years). However, chancellor Osborne did not do us any favours by stressing, foolishly and far too often, that the UK's credit rating (given by the very agencies who failed to spot the imminence of the global financial crisis) was the be-all-and-end-all of the tests of the coalition's deficit reduction strategy. Now the Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, can be heard proclaiming that it is not the be-all-and-end-all. Why? Because it is not working. Whitehall insiders recognise when a government is beginning to fall apart: Ministers become more obsessed than usual with \"tomorrow's headlines\". And the more obsessed they become, the worse are the headlines. Even those of us with long memories wrack our brains to think of any budget that has fallen apart so quickly as George Osborne's abysmal effort this year. Things have reached a pretty pass when even the International Monetary Fund urges the chancellor to think of easing up on the deficit reduction strategy and consider introducing temporary tax cuts. As it is, the premature rise in VAT to 20% is likely to go down as one of the great fiscal misjudgments in recent British economic history. Things have become so desperate that the refunds being made by the banks of mis-sold payment protection insurance are now being talked up as a reflationary measure. This, assuredly, as Dr Johnson said of patriotism, is \"the last refuge of a scoundrel\" \u2013 although I hesitate, for legal reasons, to call George Osborne a scoundrel. Talking of Osborne, one notes that there is much speculation about a cabinet reshuffle, although there is also much guidance that this will not involve the most obvious candidate for such a shuffle, namely the chancellor. Cameron's more illustrious predecessors, such as Harold Macmillan, would have had no hesitation in giving a discredited chancellor his marching orders. But to sack Osborne would of course be to admit the failure of the strategy, and invite retribution from the rating agencies. A Macmillan, of course, would have been big enough to call their bluff.",
