      "bodyText": "The Australian Taxation Office, in keeping with tax transparency laws, has reported information for nearly 2,000 organisations, including the publicly, foreign and privately owned. But crucial information was missing and this keeps the public in the dark about tax avoidance. According to the ATO, in information provided with its report, entities with taxable income or tax payable of zero or less are not disclosed because: Confidentiality provisions prevent the ATO providing any additional information about particular taxpayers in the report. All tax returns are confidential: the contents aren\u2019t available to the public. The transparency legislation is a departure from that rule and mandates that the ATO commissioner discloses only five line items from the corporate tax return. Because the tranparency legislation doesn\u2019t include negative taxable income or tax payable which is zero (or less), the result is that this information remains confidential to the ATO. Instead, tax losses, as well as other tax offsets from taxable income, are reported under a different labels on the company tax return. The data disclosed for each entity is limited to five labels on their tax returns: the entity\u2019s name, Australian business number, total income (largely equivalent to accounting revenue), taxable income and tax payable. Details of amounts paid for the petroleum resource rent tax and the minerals resource rent tax are also included. This year four more organisations were included in the report, which covers 2014-15 compared with 2013-14. But 41 records for 2013-14 were included with this release so the number of entities for 2014-15 may increase next year. Overall, there are insignificant decreases in total income, taxable income and tax payable from last year. The largest decrease was in taxable income, which declined by 7.5% for the average entity, whereas the decline in tax payable was only 2.5%. Despite the ATO\u2019s best efforts in getting organisations to pay the correct amount of tax, the corporate tax collections slightly decreased from 2013-14 to 2014-15. Entities are required to register for goods and services tax, and therefore receive an ABN, if their turnover (total income) is above $75,000. In this latest report 24 entities did not have an ABN for both years, in contravention of the Tax Administration Act 1953. The majority of organisations reported have tax payable at close to the company tax rate (30%) on taxable income, in both years. Notwithstanding, there are 355 entities (including Mitsubishi Development, Lendlease Corp, Exxonmobil Australia, Virgin Australia, Citic Resources Australia, General Motors Australia and Vodafone Hutchinson Australia) that disclosed no taxable income or tax payable for both 2013-14 and 2014-15. That\u2019s a huge $427bn of combined revenue these organisations paid no tax on over the two-year period ($214bn in 2013-14 and $213bn in 2014-15). There were also 61 other entities (including BlueScope Steel, BHP Billiton Aluminium Australia, CSL, RACV and Boeing Australia) that reported taxable income but no taxes payable over the two years. This is despite reporting combined taxable income of almost $5bn ($2.1bn in 2013-14 and $2.9bn in 2014-15). According to the ATO, these figures do \u201cnot necessarily mean tax avoidance, and assumptions about an entity\u2019s compliance with their tax obligations, or those of their associated groups, cannot be made solely on the basis of this data\u201d. But this brings into question the whole purpose of the Australian tax transparency laws. According to the explanatory notes to the legislation, the laws are based on the following grounds: To discourage aggressive tax practices. To inform public debate about corporate tax policy. To address concerns by the Group of 20 and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development regarding tax base erosion and profit shifting by multinational entities. The transparency reports may discourage aggressive tax policies, particularly the more extreme activities, but the limited disclosures do little to inform public debate about corporate tax policy. Based on these disclosures, users of these reports are limited to the view that the majority of entities on the list appear to be paying their fair share of tax, while those that are paying nothing, despite reporting billions in revenues and taxable income, are \u201cnot necessarily avoiding tax\u201d \u2013 according to the ATO. The reporting of taxable income but no tax payable may be the result of businesses applying carried forward tax losses or the use of other tax offsets that are provided by the tax system. Another reason for the high level of compliance with the tax regime is dividend imputation. This provides incentives for Australian-owned firms to pay tax on earnings at the full company tax rate. The issue of companies accumulating large tax losses is controversial, especially in light of scrutiny of the petroleum resource rent tax. An International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation report suggested that Chevron\u2019s Gorgon project has accumulated sufficient tax credits from such losses to offset any tax liability for the next 10 to 20 years. There is suspicion the $17bn cost blowout for the project is being artificially inflated through excessive interest deductions, debt loading, management fees and transport costs. The fact that losses can be carried forward to offset future tax liabilities makes the disclosure of losses as important for transparency as is the reporting of profits. The ATO tax transparency reports provide useful information about the tax affairs of Australia\u2019s largest entities, even if they are somewhat limited. They provide confidence that the largest and wealthiest entities are contributing their fair share of tax revenue to the common good. But the lack of disclosure of losses and other tax offsets is a black mark against the goal of tax transparency. This is particularly important considering annual revenues of more than $1.7tn are involved.

      "bodyText": "Before one dives into the political and regulatory thickets of media plurality and competition, there is a basic question to be asked about 21st Century Fox\u2019s \u00a310.75-a-share bid for Sky. Are the financial terms any good? Standard wisdom says Martin Gilbert and his panel of independent Sky non-executive directors can hold their heads high because the bid premium looks decent by traditional yardsticks. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s US company is offering 36% more than Sky\u2019s closing share price last Thursday, or 40% more than last Tuesday\u2019s level. But that analysis is too breezy, and too kind to Gilbert &amp; co. The bid premium only looks vaguely pretty because Sky\u2019s share price has tumbled in recent months \u2013 from \u00a311 in April to 773p before Murdoch dispatched his offer last Wednesday. The reasons for that decline are reasonably well understood. The investment world has been fretting that Sky is losing its ability to raise prices. BT offers alternative football attractions these days, rich newcomers like Netflix and Amazon have arrived on the TV scene, and UK consumers\u2019 real incomes may soon be squeezed by the fall in sterling. Plus, Sky, after the takeovers of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, is carrying more debt these days, introducing another level of risk. Yet there is little evidence that Sky\u2019s management share such anxieties. \u201cEach of our markets is making very strong progress,\u201d chief executive Jeremy Darroch reported at the full-year results in July, when the dividend was raised for the 12th year in a row. In October, the top brass delivered a blitz of bullishness in a day of presentations to investors, describing the many ways in which Sky can improve its Italian and German operations and feed new products, including mobile phones, to a fundamentally loyal set of customers in the UK. View those presentations and you would not come away with the impression that the management think Sky is in structural decline, or that they viewed the fall in the share price as justified. Quite the reverse: they sounded confident in the business, frustrated by the valuation and eager to prove the doubters wrong, as Sky has done many times over the years. Those outside Sky shareholders who are grumbling about the meanness of the \u00a310.75-a-share offer are right to protest. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s opportunism is legendary but Sky\u2019s independent directors are not meant to make his life easy. It is true, of course, that the presence of a 39% shareholder complicates matters because no counter-bidder will enter the fray. But it is still open to the independents to argue that a fair take-out price for Sky is closer to, say, \u00a312-a-share than \u00a311 and refuse to recommend less. Indeed, they could go further. Analysts at investment bank Citi called 21st Century Fox\u2019s offer \u201clow-ball\u201d and said fair value is \u00a313.50. As things stand, Gilbert and his independents have offered no detailed explanation of why they regard \u00a310.75 (minus any dividends subsequently paid by Sky) as acceptable. All shareholders were told in Friday\u2019s statement was that agreement was reached \u201cafter a period of negotiation\u201d that lasted about 48 hours. Why the hurry to lock down a price? The regulatory process could take months. If Gilbert, senior independent director Andrew Sukawaty, and their colleagues could explain their thinking, and how it squares with the executives\u2019 strong confidence in Sky\u2019s long-term prospects as a standalone company, one might have sympathy. There would at least be scope for a proper debate. But, as it is, the process seems rushed and lacking in transparency \u2013 and miles away from the \u201cbelt and braces\u201d scrutiny the non-executives promised. Opec\u2019s oil production cuts are the first move in a long game Round one in the latest battle in the oil market has gone Opec\u2019s way. The cartel, to the suprise of some, managed to get its squabbling house in order and agree production cuts at the Vienna summit last month. It also promised to convince some non-Opec countries, led by Russia, to deliver their own cuts, and it has now secured compliant public statements to that effect. Thus the price of a barrel of Brent has risen from $46 to $56 in a month. The impact is being felt already on forecourts in the UK. Do not assume, however, that the outbreak of harmony at Opec will last. It is too soon to conclude the cartel will be able to enforce compliance. Relying on Russia is an inherently uncertain stategy. The first test will come if US shale producers, who have cut costs to make it profitable to pump at $50 a barrel, start to increase volumes again. That would create tensions within Opec ranks. Early indications suggest the US shale industry, armed with fresh finance, is already drilling with more enthusiasm. It will be six months before we can tell if Opec has genuinely shifted the oil market in its favour.",

It will be six months before we can tell if Opec has genuinely shifted the oil market in its favour.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Lloyds Banking Group fails to meet 'fee-free' basic account guidelines", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is failing to meet \u201cfee-free\u201d guidelines for millions of its basic bank accounts, which are typically held by people on low incomes. Data published by the Treasury showed more than 3.6 million of the group\u2019s customers were at risk of running up bank charges because their accounts did not conform to a voluntary agreement reached between the government and the major high street banks in 2014. The agreement was designed to widen access to high street banks and help vulnerable customers. Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee, said the Lloyds group, in which the taxpayer still has a near-8% stake, was guilty of unacceptable behaviour. It is understood one of the accounts affected is the Halifax Easycash account, where a customer can be hit with up to three \u00a310 \u201creturned item fees\u201da day in cases in which there is not enough money in the account to make a payment but and the bank refuses to allow them to go into the red. Basic bank accounts are aimed at those who do not have a bank account or are ineligible for a standard current account. But the Treasury said that in the past, some banks sought to cut the costs of providing these by charging fees when direct debits or standing orders bounced. These charges were in some cases \u201cvery high\u201d, and some people were effectively \u201cunbanked\u201d after ending up saddled with significant overdrafts that left them unable to use their accounts , the Treasury added. In December 2014 the government reached a voluntary agreement with nine banking groups \u2013 including all the major high street names \u2013 which required them to offer fee-free banking from 1 January this year. The Treasury said there were now just under 8m basic bank accounts open in the UK, of which more than 4.1m met the 2014 agreement standards. However, that leaves more than 3.7m where customers are still not benefiting from completely fee-free banking. The vast majority of these are operated by the Lloyds group, which includes the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands. The remainder \u2013 estimated at just under 100,000 \u2013 are operated by the Royal Bank of Scotland group, which is 73% taxpayer-owned. The Treasury indicated that banks had been encouraged to migrate customers on old basic bank accounts to ones that met the guidelines, but it said they were not \u201ccompelled\u201d to do so. Mann said of the findings relating to the Lloyds group: \u201cThis is simply not good enough, and it\u2019s time Lloyds were held responsible for their actions. Over 3 million customers don\u2019t have the cheapest account possible, and that means they are potentially exposed to hidden fees.\u201d He added: \u201cThe only way Lloyds will resolve this is if they are forced to act, and that\u2019s why I am calling on the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority to fine them a percentage of their profits until this is resolved.\u201d All of the basic bank accounts at the other seven groups \u2013 Barclays, Clydesdale/Yorkshire, the Co-operative Bank, HSBC, Nationwide, Santander and TSB \u2013 are fully compliant. The Treasury also revealed that the Lloyds group accounted for almost half of the basic bank account market. Lloyds has indicated it wrote to existing basic bank account customers and gave them the option to move. But some backbook customers were not eligible for the new accounts. A spokeswoman said: \u201cWe welcome HM Treasury\u2019s data which shows that Lloyds Banking Group is opening 36% of the new basic bank accounts, demonstrating our commitment to support banking for all \u2026We believe all banks have a responsibility to provide basic bank account facilities to customers who would be otherwise excluded, and today\u2019s announcement highlights that the sector has a responsibility to do much more.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK petrol prices could rise by 3p a litre after Opec oil deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Households face further pressure from rising inflation as experts predicted a surge in petrol prices following an agreement by oil producers to cut global output. The cost of petrol is close to rising above \u00a31.20 a litre in some parts of the UK after a weekend deal between members of the Opec oil cartel and non-Opec countries. The AA motorists\u2019 organisation said the deal would add about 3p to the cost of a litre of fuel after the price of Brent crude climbed to more than $57 a barrel in the wake of the agreement. With UK inflation already expected to jump above 1% in official figures for November out on Tuesday, the latest rise in oil prices will begin to justify forecasts that inflation is heading for between 2.5% and 4% by the end of 2017. Opec, which accounts for about 40% of world supply and whose members include Saudi Arabia, said the deal with non-Opec members Russia, Mexico and Bahrain would result in a reduction of 558,000 barrels a day from 1 January. Although less than the targeted 600,000 barrels, it was the largest ever contribution to production cuts by non-Opec members and was the first such agreement between Opec and non-Opec members for 15 years. The move follows an agreement last month by Opec members to cut production by 1.2m barrels a day, also from the New Year, that followed weeks of wrangling. In January, Brent crude prices plunged to almost $27 a barrel and the price at the pumps dropped to \u00a31 a litre in some areas. But a recovery in demand for oil, especially from China and Europe, and the prospect of a deal orchestrated by Saudi Arabia to cut production has sent prices heading upwards. Brent crude jumped more than 6% to $57.89 a barrel, its highest level since mid-July 2015. The AA said the average price would rise from \u00a31.15 a litre for unleaded petrol to \u00a31.18, though in London and parts of the south-east, where prices have already hit \u00a31.17, the figure could rise above \u00a31.20. Adding to the oil price momentum was a comment from Saudi Arabia suggesting it could make bigger cuts than first envisaged. The Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, said: \u201cI can tell you with absolute certainty that effective 1 January, we\u2019re going to cut and cut substantially to be below the level that we have committed to on 30 November.\u201d Meanwhile, Iraq\u2019s oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi told Reuters the country was committed to complying with the pact, although it was confident it had the potential to raise output in the future. He said: \u201cThe cuts will aim at the figures we agreed with Opec definitely, but [for] the areas of the cuts there are many options on the table.\u201d But the prospect of US shale producers continuing to raise their own output levels, offsetting cuts by Opec, meant analysts were divided over whether the oil price has further to climb. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said a Trump-inspired growth spurt in the US and a recovery in China could spur demand for oil at a time when Opec has found a way to restrict supply. \u201cMake no mistake about it \u2013 this historic agreement is a gamechanger. Although the crude oil rally has already started at the end of last month when the Opec first announced the deal, I think there is plenty of fuel left in this rally,\u201d he said. \u201cAdmittedly, after a big gap we may see a retracement of some sort in prices now but ultimately the fundamentals still point to higher levels going forward. The oil market will now be balanced earlier than would have been the case without a deal. \u201cIt is very likely that US shale producers will take advantage of this opportunity to ramp up their crude output once again but this will be a worry for another day. David Hufton, a strategist at oil brokers PVM Oil Associates, said oil supplies were still expanding despite the deal and warned the price of oil was driven more \u201cby speculative players, moving in herds\u201d. Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, said the Brent crude price was likely to be capped at $60. \u201cRight now the market is kind of feeding on itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market could push [West Texas] another $1 to $2 up to $55, and Brent could go to about $60, but at that point there are some concerns that are going to start to cap the rally.\u201d Luke Bosdet, oil analyst at the AA, said US shale producers would react by increasing production to benefit from the higher oil price. \u201cThey have become more efficient during the two years of low prices and many firms can now make money at prices below $60 a barrel,\u201d he said.",

But a recovery in demand for oil, especially from China and Europe, and the prospect of a deal orchestrated by Saudi Arabia to cut production has sent prices heading upwards.</p> <p>Brent crude jumped more than 6% to $57.89 a barrel, its highest level since mid-July 2015. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The AA said the average price would rise from \u00a31.15 a litre for unleaded petrol to \u00a31.18, though in London and parts of the south-east, where prices have already hit \u00a31.17, the figure could rise above \u00a31.20.</p> <p>Adding to the oil price momentum was a comment from Saudi Arabia suggesting it could make bigger cuts than first envisaged. The Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, said: \u201cI can tell you with absolute certainty that effective 1 January, we\u2019re going to cut <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/30/oil-price-opec-cut-in-output-saudi-arabia-deal-market\">and cut substantially to be below the level that we have committed to on 30 November</a>.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Meanwhile, Iraq\u2019s oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi told Reuters the country was committed to complying with the pact, although it was confident it had the potential to raise output in the future. He said: \u201cThe cuts will aim at the figures we agreed with Opec definitely, but [for] the areas of the cuts there are many options on the table.\u201d</p> <p>But the prospect of US shale producers continuing to raise their own output levels, offsetting cuts by Opec, meant analysts were divided over whether the oil price has further to climb.</p> <p>Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said a Trump-inspired growth spurt in the US and a recovery in China could spur demand for oil at a time when Opec has found a way to restrict supply.</p> <p>\u201cMake no mistake about it \u2013 this historic agreement is a gamechanger. Although the crude oil rally has already started at the end of last month when the Opec first announced the deal, I think there is plenty of fuel left in this rally,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAdmittedly, after a big gap we may see a retracement of some sort in prices now but ultimately the fundamentals still point to higher levels going forward. The oil market will now be balanced earlier than would have been the case without a deal.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very likely that US shale producers will take advantage of this opportunity to ramp up their crude output once again but this will be a worry for another day.</p> <p>David Hufton, a strategist at oil brokers PVM Oil Associates, said oil supplies were still expanding despite the deal and warned the price of oil was driven more \u201cby speculative players, moving in herds\u201d.</p> <p>Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, said the Brent crude price was likely to be capped at $60. \u201cRight now the market is kind of feeding on itself,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe market could push [West Texas] another $1 to $2 up to $55, and Brent could go to about $60, but at that point there are some concerns that are going to start to cap the rally.\u201d</p> <p>Luke Bosdet, oil analyst at the AA, said US shale producers would react by increasing production to benefit from the higher oil price.</p> <p>\u201cThey have become more efficient during the two years of low prices and many firms can now make money at prices below $60 a barrel,\u201d he said.</p> <p></p>",

The plunge in the value of sterling over the last six months means the US company is paying about 15% less than it would have done if the deal was struck on the day of the referendum on 23 June. Fox and Sky announced on Friday they had agreed a deal for Murdoch\u2019s film and television firm to pay \u00a311.2bn for the 61% of Sky it does not already own, equivalent to $14.1bn. However, since the vote sterling has fallen from about $1.48 to under $1.26, meaning if Fox had made the same \u00a310.75 per share offer on the day of the referendum, it would have cost in the region of $16.6bn \u2013 close to $2.5bn more. Murdoch\u2019s papers the Sun and the Sunday Times both backed Brexit, but the Times ran a leader supporting remain. Murdoch himself described the vote for Brexit as \u201cwonderful\u201d just days after the referendum. The newspapers were separated from Fox in 2013 and are owned through Murdoch\u2019s subsidiary News Corp.

      "bodyText": "Online fashion retailer Asos has unveiled plans to hire 1,500 staff at its London headquarters and to double domestic manufacturing of its own-brand clothing. The company, which employs 2,500 people at the site in Camden, north London, said it expected to spend about \u00a338m on additional specialists in technology, marketing, editorial content and retail as it aims to double sales over the next five years. It is investing another \u00a340m in building an additional 40,000 sq ft (3,700 sq metres) at its base at the art deco Greater London House, formerly the Carreras cigarette factory, to house the extra workers. Nick Beighton, the chief executive, said Asos expected to open several more manufacturing facilities in the UK over the next three to four years, in order to double capacity from the two factories which make about 4% of its own-label products at present. The move is good news for UK fashion manufacturing, which was decimated in the 1990s when work moving abroad but has begun to see a renaissance in recent years amid rising costs in China and increasing demand for high fashion made quickly. Asos has been investing in training workers in the capital for more than five years at a factory in Haringey, north London, which employs about 100 people, 40 of whom are stitching dresses for Asos, Marks &amp; Spencer and online specialist Finery. Asos\u2019s UK investment is the latest financial commitment to the UK by a major digital business. It follows significant investment announcements from Facebook and Google, which plan to increase their staff numbers in the UK, despite fears that Brexit would make the country a less attractive place to invest. Alongside a number of British online retailers, Asos has benefited from the drop in the value of the pound, because almost 60% of its sales are outside the UK. Asos said the renovation of its HQ would include new staircases and light wells, a health club, training academy and \u201cquiet zone library\u201d, plus a tech bar and concierge service for staff. Beighton said: \u201cOur people are what make Asos special. We are creating a workspace that fosters creativity, where they can enjoy what they do.\u201d Asos is one of the companies that have come under scrutiny over working practices at their warehouses in recent months, after the Guardian\u2019s disclosure last year that temporary workers at Sports Direct were being paid less than the minimum wage. Neil Derrick, the Yorkshire regional secretary of the GMB union which has led protests against conditions at a warehouse near Barnsley which handles distribution for Asos, said: \u201cWe welcome the announcement of 1,500 new jobs at Asos but not when GMB\u2019s concerns for the workers in Yorkshire have been completely ignored. \u201cThe company\u2019s growth is on back of workers in their Yorkshire warehouse, yet there seems to be a huge disparity between how Asos staff in London and workers in Yorkshire are treated. Conditions in Barnsley are frankly shocking and have caused the GMB grave concern over the past two years. \u201cIf Asos want to provide \u2018fashion with integrity\u2019 as they claim, working with us to make their Yorkshire site a decent place to work would be a start.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Italy is prepared to launch a multibillion-euro rescue of Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) by the end of this week if the bank fails in its last-ditch effort to secure \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.2bn) from private investors, according to a finance ministry official. The official told the Guardian the ministry was \u201cfully confident\u201d that the world\u2019s oldest bank would be able to carry through its plans to bolster its financial strength without recourse to the taxpayer. \u201cWe are confident that the full plan works. So far we can only wait and see,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe think MPS will be able to raise capital on the markets over the next few days.\u201d Shares in Italy\u2019s third largest bank have seesawed in recent days amid uncertainty about how it will meet regulator\u2019s demands to find more capital after it was the weakest performer of any of the 51 banks tested by the European Banking Authority in an annual health check of the sector in July. MPS had asked the European Central Bank for an extension from the end of the year to 20 January to find the extra capital. The ECB is reported to have rejected such a move, which raised fears that the Italian government would have to intervene and on Friday drove its shares down 10%. But on Monday the shares were up 3.5% after MPS said it would press on with its existing plans to find funds. This includes a debt-for-equity swap and also a cash call to raise about \u20ac2bn from investors. Fears about the strength of Italy\u2019s banking system, which is weighed down by \u20ac360bn of bad loans, have focused on MPS. But UniCredit, Italy\u2019s biggest bank, is expected to announce on Tuesday its intention to tap investors for about \u20ac13bn when its chief executive, Jean-Pierre Mustier, meets investors in London. Any cash call by UniCredit would take place early next year, by which time the European authorities will have hoped to plug the gap at MPS. If MPS fails to secure a rescue by private investors in the coming days, Italy would embark on a precautionary recapitalisation, the finance ministry official said. Such a move would cost Italy between \u20ac2bn and \u20ac4bn and would fall under EU rules that forbid state intervention unless bondholders first take a hit. The private sector plan is being led by Wall Street bank JP Morgan and is thought to require a major investor \u2013 such as the sovereign wealth fund from Qatar \u2013 to commit about \u20ac1bn. However, it is thought that an investment on that scale would not be made until the political uncertainty sparked by the resignation of the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, abates. Paolo Gentiloni, the foreign minister in Renzi\u2019s government and now prime minister-designate, is in the process of forming a new government \u2013 a move that could make it easier to attract investors to MPS. The private capital injection ought to be launched by the bank this week and any intervention by the Italian government \u2013 if it becomes necessary \u2013 would not take place before this Friday or next Monday. While retail investors who hold \u20ac2.1bn of bonds in MPS might incur losses through a state intervention, Italy could probably seek an arrangement in which those bondholders would eventually be compensated. The prospects of tens of thousands of ordinary Italians losing their savings is one reason why such a rescue has been politically toxic even though MPS has long been considered the weakest bank in Italy. The problems facing Italy\u2019s banks are reflected in forecasts for the country\u2019s economic growth. The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s forecast for growth in the eurozone\u2019s third largest economy will fall below 1% over the next two years.",

      "bodyText": "European stock markets are now closed, so let\u2019s wrap up: Financial markets are expecting higher inflation after a group of oil producers sealed their first joint production cut deal since 2001. Brent crude is trading at a 17-month high, up 3.6% or $2 per barrel at $56.27, after 11 non-Opec members including Russia agreed to cut their production by around 550,00 barrels per day. That commitment means Opec will now deliver the 1.2m bpd cut agreed at the end of November, potentially putting a floor under oil prices. However the move has also sparked a selloff in European government bonds, driving borrowing costs higher as investors anticipate a spike in consumer price inflation, and higher interest rates. UK 10-year bond yields hit 1.5% for the first time since March. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, sum up the situation. \u201cThe historic OPEC deal over the weekend has led to confidence in the market pushing up to a 5 % surge in Oil prices. Euro Zone government bond yields have risen significantly reflecting among other things an expectation of higher inflation. As Saudi Arabia made greater than expected cuts and non-OPEC countries agreed cuts of 558,000 barrels a day, oil prices peaked at a 17 month high with WTI trading at $54.2 and U.S. Brent rising 4.4% at $56.73 per barrel, steadily clawing out from the slump \u2013 boosting oil stocks and Middle Eastern bonds among other assets. There\u2019s been drama on Wall Street, where $4bn was wiped off Lockheed Martin\u2019s value in early trading after Donald Trump tweeted that its F-35 jets were too expensive. Investors rushed to sell Lockheed shares, as the defence firm rushed out a statement defending the cost of the project and offering to discuss it with the president-elect. Another sign that the president-elect can move the markets with a tweet. But there\u2019s been little progress in the frenzied push to recapitalise Italy\u2019s banking sector. That could be a good sign -- Rome\u2019s government hasn\u2019t given up persuading private investors from injecting fresh cash into Monte dei Paschi (MPS) Italian bank stocks have gained ground today, with MPS closing 3.7% higher tonight. Paolo Gentiloni is being sworn in as Italy\u2019s next prime minister today, so he should soon be able to crack on with tackling the situation. Sources in the Italian Treasury have said that they are prepared to bail out MPS if needed, but hope that the bank can raise \u20ac5bn from investors. A senior ECB policymaker has said the bank has never discussed resorting to helicopter money, in an attempt to stimulate the eurozone economy. Over in Paris, Christine Lagarde has faced judges over claims of negligence during her time as finance minister. And European stock markets have just closed after a fairly unimpressive day. In London the FTSE 100 shed 63 points, or almost 1%, to 6890. That\u2019s partly because the pound had a good day against the US dollar, up almost one cent (bad news for exporters). That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting! GW True to her word, Christine Lagarde has not stayed silent - instead, she\u2019s told judges in Paris that she will fight the allegations that she was negligent by allowing the \u20ac400m payment to Bernard Tapie in 2008. Lagarde told the court that: \u201cI would like to show you that I am in no way guilty of negligence, but rather that I acted in good faith with only the public interest in mind.\u201d \u201cWas I negligent? No. And I will strive to convince you allegation by allegation.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Rupert Murdoch\u2019s attempt to take over broadcaster Sky has taken an interesting twist, as my colleague Mark Sweney explains: Advisers on the transaction between Sky and Fox, which is expected to lodge an official bid later this week, are pursuing a so-called \u201cscheme of arrangement\u201d. This tactic, which requires Sky to gain approval from investors representing 75% of the voting rights, will ensure that all shareholders against the deal are forced to sell once the threshold is reached. This would protect Murdoch from the unfortunate scenario where he finally claims his prize, but is left with a mutinous rump of investors who don\u2019t sell their Sky shares. Here\u2019s the full statement from Lockheed Martin, defending the cost of its F-35 fighters following Donald Trump\u2019s criticism. [Lockheed Martin delivered Israel its first two F-35 jets today] My colleague Kim Willsher reports that Christine Lagarde isn\u2019t planning to keep silent during her trial: The president of the court asked Lagarde how she intended to defend herself and if she wished to exercise her right to remain silent. \u201cI have no intention of keeping silent, madame la presidente,\u201d Lagarde replied. Here\u2019s Kim\u2019s report: Christine Lagarde\u2019s lawyer has urged the judges at the Plais de Justice to pause her trial for negligence during her time as French finance minister. Associated Press has the latest details from today\u2019s court hearing. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde went on trial Monday in a Paris court, accused of negligence for allowing a huge handout to a well-connected businessman when she was in the French government. Poised and serious, Lagarde took notes as the judge summed up the years-long legal saga that led to charges against her charges she contests. A well-respected pioneer for women in leadership, Lagarde faces up to a year in prison if convicted. A lawyer for Lagarde, Patrick Maisonneuve, pleaded for a delay in the proceedings, arguing that it doesn\u2019t make sense for her to face trial while a separate investigation in the broader case is still underway. It is unclear whether the judges will decide Monday on the appeal or adjourn for deliberations. The case revolves around a \u20ac403m ($425 million) payout to tycoon Bernard Tapie in an arbitration deal in 2008 over the botched sale of sportswear maker Adidas in the 1990s, when Lagarde was finance minister. The amount of the award prompted indignation in France. Investigators suspect that the whole process was rigged in favor of Tapie, a business magnate with close connections with political circles, including then-President Nicolas Sarkozy. Civil courts have since quashed the unusually generous award, declared the arbitration process and deal fraudulent and ordered Tapie to pay the money back. Lagarde is accused of \u201cserious negligence\u201d that allegedly allowed other people in the case to commit a suspected major misappropriation of public funds. Investigating judges say Lagarde committed a series of serious errors when she made the arbitration choice and also, later on, when she refused to challenge the deal, suggesting she may have been influenced by the political connections between Tapie and Sarkozy, according to court documents. Despite Lockheed Martin\u2019s problem, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a fresh record high in early trading on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average has also hit a new high, and at 19,776 is getting close to the 20,000 mark. Energy companies are rallying on the back of the oil production cut deal agreed over the weekend. A Lockheed Martin executive has responded to Donald Trump\u2019s attack, insisting that the company has taken steps to cut the costs of its F-35 programme. Reuters has the details: Since the beginning, we have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the price of the airplane by about 70% since its original costing, and we project it to be about 85 million dollars in the 2019 or 2020 time frame\u201d, said Jeff Babione, Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 programme leader. That hasn\u2019t stopped the company\u2019s shares falling by almos 5% in early trading, knocking almost $4bn off its value. The European Central Bank has never discussed flooding the eurozone with helicopter money. That\u2019s according to ECB board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, who has just completed an online Q&amp;A about monetary policy. Asked if the ECB could embrace helicopter funding (which means either a) handing the public money, or b) creating money to explicitly fund government spending), C\u0153ur\u00e9 indicated that it isn\u2019t on the ECB\u2019s agenda. C\u0153ur\u00e9 also defended the ECB\u2019s decision to trim its QE programme to \u20ac60bn per month of new bond purchases, from April, even though it sees inflation below target in 2019. C\u0153ur\u00e9 also argued that banks shouldn\u2019t grumble too much about record low interest rates -- ultraloose monetary policy does benefit them too: And he gets a bonus mark for playing this delivery too: The president-elect has done it again..... Shares in US defence firm Lockheed Martin are losing altitude in pre-market trading after Donald Trump tweeted that the F-35 fighter jet programme was \u201cout of control\u201d/ Trump is promising to make big cuts once in office, which will wipe 2% off the company\u2019s share price when trading begins on Wall Street in 45 minutes. The F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter is a stealth jet, designed and manufactured by Lockheed Martin in partnership with other defence firms. Last month the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin a $6.1bn contract to produce 57 F-35 stealth fighters -- the ninth batch, and 58% cheaper than the first order. Clearly not enough of a saving for Mr Trump.... The Russian rouble has leapt by 2%, after oil producers hammered out that deal to cut global output by 1.8m barrels per day. One US dollar now buys just 61.2 ruble, the lowest since October 2015 - before fears over Russia\u2019s economy hammered the currency: Newsflash: Christine Lagarde has now arrived at the Paris courthouse where she\u2019ll be tried of allegations of negligence (as explained earlier). Security is tight outside the courthouse: Here\u2019s Patrick Maisonneuve, Lagarde lawyer: Officials representing Greece\u2019s creditors will head back to Athens tomorrow, in another attempt to complete the latest review of its bailout. European Commission officials say they hope to complete the work soon: But...the two sides still seem someway apart, with Greece\u2019s lenders demanding economic reforms to hit its bailout targets. And finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has warned creditors not to be too hardline, urging them to consider compromises. As Tsakalotos put it: \u201cThe Greek expression is \u2018put water into wine\u2019. It\u2019s not an expression I like, because I wouldn\u2019t like my wine watered down, but you know what I mean, to reach an honest compromise.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Connan has tweeted from inside France\u2019s Cour de Justice, where the head of the IMF will face a special tribunal over the Tapie Affair today. Bloomberg also have a snappy summary of the case against Christine Lagarde: Basically, that Lagarde didn\u2019t do enough to stop a payout to [businessman Bernard] Tapie. She\u2019s accused of gross negligence in the use of public funds, a rarely used charge brought in cases where the evidence suggests the defendant didn\u2019t knowingly participate in activities to defraud the state. According to the indictment, Lagarde got at least two things wrong. First, she gave her go-ahead in October 2007 to the arbitration procedure even though the French investment agency, Agence des Participations de l\u2019Etat, \u201crepeatedly\u201d advised her against it. She\u2019s also accused of waiving the right to appeal the arbitration decision even though she was told that a possible legal challenge was available. More here: What\u2019s at Stake in Lagarde\u2019s French Trial: QuickTake Q&amp;A Heads-up: The European Central Bank is holding an online Q&amp;A in 90 minutes time (from 1pm GMT) It\u2019s looking for questions on monetary policy, having just decided to extend its bond-buying stimulus programme until the end of 2017. You can post them on Twitter using the #AskECB hashtag. Italian bank shares are rallying this morning, on hopes that the country\u2019s new government can resolve the problem in its financial sector. UBI Banca, the country\u2019s fifth largest lender, has jumped by over 4% while Unicredit and Banco Populare di Milano have both gained over 2.5% And this is helping Italy\u2019s stock market to outperform the rest of Europe; Milan\u2019s FTSE MIB is the only index up today. The City is hoping that the appointment of Italy\u2019s new prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, will create an opportunity to resolve the crisis. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics explains: Gentiloni\u2019s appointment is expected to mean the current Finance Minister, Padoan, stays in his post to focus on resolving the banking sector. While Monte dei Paschi is teetering on the brink of a collapse, an interim technocratic government is more likely to take on the difficult political capital cost involved in plugging in the bank\u2019s capital gap, by bailing in retail shareholders, with the promise of some fiscal compensation after the next election. The fact that private investors are shunning Italian political risk after the Referendum means that onus lies with the interim government to ensure successful political containment and prevent Eurozone systemic risk. Thus, while investors will continue to dislike uncertainty, the political risk-rewards of a likely compromise with Monte dei Paschi shareholders in the next few weeks, together with the EU\u2019s own backstop mechanisms, means that the situation will likely be contained. America\u2019s borrowing costs have hit their highest level in around 18 months, as the yield on US Treasury bills rises. That\u2019s partly due to the inflationary impact of the oil deal, and partly due to predictions that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates on Wednesday. Reuters\u2019 source at the Italian Treasury has given more details about how a state bailout of Monte dei Paschi might be handled: European government bonds are taking a bath this morning, amid fears that the deal to curb oil production will drive inflation higher. Prices are falling across the board, which pushes up the yield (or interest rate) on sovereign debt. Britain\u2019s 10-year gilt yield hit 1.5% for the first time since May, up from 1.43% on Friday night. Most eurozone debt is also out of favour. Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield has hit 0.396%, up from 0.347% on Friday, while France\u2019s 10-year yield has hit an 11-month high of 0.919%. And the gap between Italy and Spain\u2019s borrowing costs has widened to its widest level since February 2012 -- the heights of the eurozone debt crisis. Rising bond yields usually signify that the City is expecting higher inflation -- and thus demanding a higher rate of return when buying bonds. Reuters is reporting that Italy\u2019s government is prepared to recapitalise Monte dei Paschi if necessary - but still hopeful that private investors will stump up for the bank\u2019s \u20ac5bn cash call. Here\u2019s the story: Italy is ready to pump capital into Monte dei Paschi di Siena if the ailing bank fails to get the money it needs to remain in business from investors, a Treasury source said on Monday. Italy\u2019s third-biggest bank is pressing ahead with a plan to raise \u20ac5bn ($5.3 billion) on the market this year,despite political uncertainty in the country after a constitutional referendum triggered a government crisis. \u201cThere is confidence at the economy ministry that Monte dei Paschi\u2019s cash call can succeed. If the operation failed, the state would carry out a precautionary recapitalisation,\u201d the Treasury source said. \u201cThe bank\u2019s existence and its clients\u2019 savings will be preserved under any circumstances,\u201d the source added. Last night, MPS reopened its debt-to-equity swap -- which would allow retail investors to convert their bonds into shares. That could help to hit its target of raising \u20ac5bn in new capital. Over in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have jumped by 7.5% at the start of trading. The move came as EU economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici declared that Italy can tackle its banking problems without creating a new crisis. Moscovici was in best \u201cDon\u2019t panic!\u201d mode on France Info radio, saying: \u201cThere is not and there will not be a banking crisis in Italy, there will not be a European financial crisis coming from Italy. \u201cWe have the capacity to deal with the situation and it will be dealt with from both in Italy and at the European level.\u201d However, there\u2019s still no word on whether private investors will provide MPS with a lifeline, or whether its cash call will fail. Shares in oil companies are jumping this morning as investors anticipate higher profits once the output cuts kick in. Royal Dutch Shell have jumped by 3%, while BP are up 2%. Smaller oil exploration and production are also benefiting, with Tullow Oil up 8% and Cairn Energy gaining 6%. City experts agree that the deal agreed by Opec and non-Opec members are significant. But some suspect that prices may not rise much higher, because America\u2019s shale industry has not made promised to make any cuts. Morgan Stanley say this the deal should \u201cadd to bullish sentiment\u201d in the market, especially if producers actually comply with the cuts: FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed believes the oil price could push higher -- at which point US shale producers could easily return to the market. With 1.758 million barrels expected to be slashed out of the market, or about 2% of the global oil supply starting January 1, oil prices have more room to rally with Brent potentially crossing above $60 in the next couple of weeks. The market\u2019s focus will then switch to compliance with the agreement, and U.S. shale producers who are not a part of the agreement. U.S. rig counts rose by 21 last week to 498, the biggest increase since mid-2015, and the questions now becomes how fast will US shale ramp up production and at what level is it possible to cap the current rally? These production cuts show that Opec and non-Opec members are serious about putting a floor under the oil price, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. Saudi Arabia has shown a willingness to bring its oil production below the 10 million barrels a day mark. This is surely a sign that the country is serious about lowering the supply glut on the market. Moreover, this also shows that they are willing to do more than the non-OPEC countries to push the price of oil higher. Traders are also cheering the news that Russia is also going to cut its oil production by 300K barrels a day by May 2017. But Barclays believe prices will fall back during 2017. \u201cThere are too many moving parts for OPEC\u2019s new policy to be sustainable in the long term. The strategy is bound to overshoot, in our view, leading to lower prices in the second half of next year.\u201d The oil price is surging this morning, after energy producers hammered out a historic deal to cut output over the weekend. A group of 11 countries who are not part of the Opec cartel collectively agreed to cut output by 558,000 barrels per day, from January 1. That bolsters the production cuts agreed by Opec late last month; they are cutting 1.2m barrels per day in an attempt to cut the worldwide glut in oil and drive prices higher. It\u2019s the first such deal between Opec and non-Opec members in 15 years. And in further drama, Saudi Arabia also signalled that it might be prepared to make deeper cuts, on top of what it initially pledged. Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said after Sunday\u2019s meeting. \u201cI can tell you with absolute certainty that effective January 1, we\u2019re going to cut and cut substantially to be below the level that we have committed to on November 30.\u201d This is having a serious effect on oil this morning, driving Brent Crude and US Crude price to their highest level since last July. Brent, the benchmark for global oil price, is up 4.4% at $56.73 per barrel. Great news for Opec. But if prices stay at the levels, motorists can expect to pay more at the pump, and heating our homes might get pricier too.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... The battle to rescue Italy\u2019s banks will continue this week, now that foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni has been chosen to replace Matteo Renzi as prime minister. Executives at Monte dei Paschi, Italy\u2019s oldest bank, are making a final attempt to persuade private investors to back its \u20ac5bn cash call. If they fail, the bank could soon find itself swept into a bail-in. From Rome, my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports: Executives at Monte dei Paschi of Siena (MPS) were fighting on Sunday night to salvage a multibillion-euro rescue by private investors in a frantic attempt to prop up the bank. In a statement released after a board meeting on Sunday, the world\u2019s oldest bank said it would forge ahead with a debt-for-equity swap offer for tens of thousands of retail investors. The offer still requires regulatory approval. If MPS manages to convince investors to go along with the plan, it would help it avoid a government bailout by Italy, which would have far-reaching economic and political consequences. A deal to prop up MPS was thrown into doubt last week after the European Central Bank (ECB) reportedly said it could not have more time to secure the private investment. MPS had sought an extension until 20 January. Also on the agenda: Investors are watching the oil price closely, after producers agreed an output deal over the weekend (more on that shortly). IMF chief Christine Lagarde is appearing before judges in Paris this afternoon, over charges relating to the \u20ac400m payment made to businessman Bernard Tapie when she was French finance minister. Lagarde denies charges of negligence, but could potentially face up to a year in jail and a fine of \u20ac15,000 if convicted. She\u2019s already pleaded her case on France 2 television, saying: \u201cNegligence is a non-intentional offence. I think we are all a bit negligent sometimes in our life. I have done my job as well as I could, within the limits of what I knew.\u201d And traders are also counting down the hours until Wednesday afternoon, when America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, is widely expected to raise US interest rates. Fed chief Janet Yellen will also face a lot of questions about president-elect Donald Trump, we assume. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The amount of the award prompted indignation in France. </p> <p>Investigators suspect that the whole process was rigged in favor of Tapie, a business magnate with close connections with political circles, including then-President Nicolas Sarkozy. </p> <p>Civil courts have since quashed the unusually generous award, declared the arbitration process and deal fraudulent and ordered Tapie to pay the money back. </p> <p>Lagarde is accused of \u201cserious negligence\u201d that allegedly allowed other people in the case to commit a suspected major misappropriation of public funds. </p> <p>Investigating judges say Lagarde committed a series of serious errors when she made the arbitration choice and also, later on, when she refused to challenge the deal, suggesting she may have been influenced by the political connections between Tapie and Sarkozy, according to court documents.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-12T16:04:28.341Z\">at 4.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-584ec25be4b077e98485026a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-12T15:32:26.275Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Despite Lockheed Martin\u2019s problem, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a fresh record high in early trading on Wall Street.</strong></p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average has also hit a new high, and at 19,776 is getting close to the 20,000 mark.</p> <p>Energy companies are rallying on the back of the oil production cut deal agreed over the weekend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FoxBusiness/status/808329441202110464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Dow touches another record high. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WallStreet?src=hash\">#WallStreet</a>.   <a href=\"https://t.co/50AuEFyHMJ\">https://t.co/50AuEFyHMJ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/VZj0bMA09Z\">pic.twitter.com/VZj0bMA09Z</a></p>&mdash; FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxBusiness/status/808329441202110464\">December 12, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584ebe7be4b0e02f2b16b586\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-12T15:13:05.687Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LukeReuters/status/808327698439348224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One F-35 \ud83d\udee9costs @ $100 million.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch is planning a form of takeover for Sky that would make it easier for his 21st Century Fox group to squeeze out shareholders opposed to the \u00a311.2bn deal. Advisers on the transaction between Sky and Fox, which is expected to lodge an official bid later this week, are pursuing a so-called \u201cscheme of arrangement\u201d. This tactic, which requires Sky to gain approval from investors representing 75% of the voting rights, will ensure that all shareholders against the deal are forced to sell once the threshold is reached. Fox owns 39.14% of Sky and has 37.19% of voteable shares, but under a scheme of arrangement it is not allowed to cast its votes. The 75% approval threshold must be met by votes from non-Fox shareholders. Sky has a significant shareholder base that is disgruntled with elements of Fox\u2019s management of the business. In October, more than 50% of Sky\u2019s independent shareholders voted against James Murdoch\u2019s reappointment as chairman. Murdoch was approved by 71.55% of total shareholders when Fox\u2019s voting power was included. Under a straightforward takeover bid for Sky, Fox could be left with an activist minority shareholder base in the pay-TV broadcaster if less than 90% of Sky\u2019s investors accepted its bid. A conventional bid would require backing from 50% of the shareholder base for Fox to take legal control, but in order to take full control of the shares and force all investors to sell would require 90% backing \u2013 much higher than the scheme of arrangement\u2019s 75%. Legal experts say getting stuck below the 90% threshold with a conventional offer could leave Fox with numerous problems, including potentially preventing Sky from taking its shares off the London Stock Exchange and becoming a fully private business. Rupert Murdoch is also facing calls to increase his \u00a311.2bn offer for Sky from investors, who are also raising questions about the boardroom structure of the broadcaster. Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox film and television group stunned the City on Friday by announcing it had clinched the agreement of Sky for the bid of \u00a310.75 cash per share. Fox is also reportedly looking to include a guarantee on protecting staff numbers and investment in the UK to help sweeten its controversial move to take full control of Sky. The legally binding guarantees, which would be enacted if Fox\u2019s takeover bid successfully navigates competition and media plurality probes, are likely to include protections for Sky\u2019s 23,000 UK staff and a guarantee of investment in Sky. Some investors said over the weekend the price \u2013 at a 40% premium to the level the shares were trading before the offer was announced \u2013 was too low. Thomas Moore, investment director of UK equities at Standard Life Investments, added to the concerns on Monday. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to represent the interests of our clients and our view would be no, this isn\u2019t a good deal.\u201d He pointed out that the Sky share price was at a level it had been trading at only a few months ago, since when the the largest pay-TV broadcaster in Britain has been setting out ways to bolster returns to shareholders. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday, Moore added: \u201cThe share price clearly was at a low ebb on Friday when the bid was rumoured and, of course, we would be expecting a full value and the question is whether the board is independent enough to represent the interest of all shareholders, not just the 40% that is owned by 21st Century Fox.\u201d The boardroom composition of Sky was also raised by other investors. Sky has attempted to address this by setting up an independent committee of the board to review the offer from 21st Century Fox. The committee is being chaired by an existing board member, Martin Gilbert, who is chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management, which owns a stake in Sky. Moore said he hoped Gilbert would step up and put forward a strong case\u201d that the bid undervalued the true value of the company. Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, another Sky shareholder, said: \u201cIt would have been preferable to have an independent chairman. The creation of an independent committee of the board (excluding James Murdoch) to consider the bid addresses some of the conflicts of interest, however it doesn\u2019t go far enough.\u201d Murdoch has had hopes of unifying the two business empires for years. In 2011, he abandoned his News Corporation\u2019s \u00a38bn bid for BSkyB after public outcry over phone hacking. Since then, the businesses have been restructured. News Corp houses the newspapers, such as the Sun and the Times, and 21st Century Fox businesses such Fox News. Sky owns TV and film assets as well as pay-TV operations in Italy and Germany. Roddy Davidson of stockbroker Shore Capital said the price was credible. But, he added, this still might not stop \u201cpushback\u201d from shareholders. Analysts at global equity research firm Jefferies said the deal may be able to overcome any concerns from Britain\u2019s media regulator. \u201cOfcom\u2019s historical reservations about media plurality seem less credible now with more fragmented landscapes of news distribution and TV, also the split of legacy News Corp TV and press interests,\u201d they said. The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, has 10 working days from being notified of a formal bid to notify the regulator that an investigation should be launched. \u201cThe [culture] department is putting in place procedures to ensure that her decision making process is scrupulously fair and impartial should a decision be necessary,\u201d Matt Hancock, minister for digital and culture, told the Commons on Monday. \u201cThe role of the secretary of state here is a quasi-judicial one and it is important that she acts independently and is not subject to improper influence.\u201d Hancock added that guidance is being drawn up for ministers and officials for dealing with interested parties in the bid. Sky said in a statement: \u201cThe company recently launched its mobile offering and less than two months ago held an investor day that gave investors a comprehensive insight in to the company and its growth plans \u2013 the market took a view and fully priced in these opportunities prior to the possible offer. \u201cThe independent directors are highly experienced and respected individuals who know their fiduciary responsibilities. \u201cIf a bid at this level is forthcoming, shareholders themselves will have the opportunity to accept a price which reflects a 40% premium or they can chose to continue to hold their stock.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has until 6 January to notify the UK takeover panel of its intention to go ahead with its \u00a311.2bn purchase of Sky. Assuming this happens, Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, must decide whether or not to launch a public interest test. What will shape Bradley\u2019s decision? If Fox bids formally then Bradley will have 10 working days to weigh up whether the deal triggers public interest concerns, as laid out in section 58 of the Enterprise Act 2002. There are three kinds of public interest concern, only one of which applies here: the issue of media plurality. According to the act there is a need \u201cin relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in a particular area or locality of the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience\u201d. What is a public interest test? If the public interest test is triggered Bradley can ask the media regulator, Ofcom, to evaluate whether the public will lose too much from a reduction in plurality. Basically, to ask whether it is in the public interest to let Murdoch take 100% control of Sky, as well as running the Times, Sunday Times and the Sun through a separate company. What is media plurality? Ofcom believes a plurality of media sources is important for a well-functioning democratic society through \u201cinformed citizens and preventing too much influence over the political process\u201d. The regulator is charged with ensuring a diversity of viewpoints across the media \u2013 TV, radio, print and online \u2013 and preventing any one owner \u201cor voice\u201d having too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda. How will 21st Century Fox\u2019s takeover of Sky affect \u2026 1 Sky News Murdoch could look to make Sky News more like his rightwing Fox News channel in the US. Any \u201cFoxification\u201d of Sky News would still have to adhere to Ofcom\u2019s rules governing due impartiality and accuracy. Fox News, which is also broadcast in the UK, has fallen foul of the regulator many times through editorial lapses. Last year, Ofcom criticised a Fox News programme for breaching the UK code when a guest said Birmingham was a city \u201cwhere non-Muslims just simply don\u2019t go\u201d. However, Sky News has built up a strong reputation since 1989 as a trusted news outlet, winning numerous awards for its journalism so changing its editorial strategy could damage the brand. As part of the failed bid in 2011, Murdoch agreed to spin off Sky News to appease media plurality concerns, a deal accepted by Ofcom and the government. Fox may give the same undertaking to avoid a full-scale \u201cphase 2\u201d investigation by competition regulators this time. 2 Sky\u2019s role in the UK TV production market Sky spends more than \u00a35bn on TV content each year, with its biggest investment in sports rights, such as Premier League football matches. It also commissions shows including Fortitude and The Tunnel from UK producers. It owns 70% of Love Productions, the company responsible for The Great British Bake Off. Fox, which owns part of a joint venture that includes the makers of MasterChef, American Idol and The Biggest Loser, as well as a Hollywood film and TV studio, could allow Sky to build a large-scale TV production arm across Europe. Can News Corp \u2013 the Murdoch company split off to house publishing assets including the Times, the Sun and the Wall Street Journal \u2013 really be a separate entity from 21st Century Fox in the UK? On paper, yes. In reality, probably not. News Corp and Fox are separately listed public companies, with Murdoch as executive chairman and executive co-chairman respectively. If regulators look at media plurality, the two companies will be viewed essentially as one. \u201cFrom a legal perspective you always look at the whole group of companies so it is irrelevant that [Murdoch\u2019s assets] have been split into two,\u201d said Alan Davies, a competition lawyer at Jones Day. \u201cIf they are under common control then the law looks at them as if they are one entity.\u201d How does the bid affect the second phase of the Leveson inquiry into the press and phone hacking? The second stage of Sir Brian Leveson\u2019s inquiry, established in the wake of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, was to have looked at issues including the extent of unlawful or improper conduct within organisations including the paper\u2019s publisher, News International (now renamed News UK and part of News Corp). That second stage has yet to be launched. In 2011, Murdoch was forced to abandon his \u00a38bn-plus bid for full control of Sky as the fallout from the phone-hacking scandal made the deal politically impossible. The Leveson report following the first stage of his inquiry proved scathing about the conduct of Murdoch\u2019s son James as chairman of News International. He ultimately stepped down as chairman, and from the same role at Sky, and moved to the US. Last year he was promoted to Fox chief executive and returned as Sky chairman in April. Hacked Off, which campaigns on behalf of victims of phone hacking, argues it is now imperative that the second stage of the inquiry is launched, especially in light of the Sky takeover approach. Could James Murdoch\u2019s historical ties with News International derail the Sky bid again? In 2012, after the phone-hacking scandal, Ofcom found that Sky remained a \u201cfit and proper\u201d owner of a UK broadcasting licence. Remaining \u201cfit and proper\u201d is an ongoing requirement of all licensees, meaning Ofcom has the right at any stage to launch a new investigation, which includes looking at directors and shareholders. However, Ofcom had a chance to air any concerns about James Murdoch and investigate his role when news broke in January that he would be returning as Sky chairman. If a range of media organisations call for the Sky takeover to be investigated \u2013 as happened in 2011 \u2013 is Bradley obliged to trigger the public interest intervention notice? No. She is supposed to decide whether to call in Ofcom of her own accord. Media organisations can lodge their views with Ofcom if it is asked to conduct a public interest test. Many observers believe that because of the level of opposition to the first bid, and because her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, felt it necessary in 2011, Bradley will have to refer the deal to Ofcom for scrutiny or face accusations of partiality.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil prices have surged to a 17-month high after a group of the world\u2019s largest producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreed to reduce output in a landmark deal. The weekend agreement between Opec and a number of non-Opec members, notably Russia, has pushed Brent crude up more than 4% to $56.64 a barrel, its highest level since mid-July 2015. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is up 4.4% at $53.78. The move follows an agreement last month by Opec to cut production by 1.2m barrels a day from 1 January next year, following weeks of wrangling. On Saturday, producers from outside Opec agreed to reduce output by 558,000 barrels a day to help end the supply glut which has sent oil prices tumbling. Although less than the targeted 600,000 barrels it was the largest ever contribution to production cuts by non-Opec members. It represents the first such deal between Opec and non-Opec members for 15 years. Adding to the oil price momentum was a comment from Saudi Arabia suggesting it could make bigger cuts than first envisaged. The Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, said: \u201cI can tell you with absolute certainty that effective 1 January, we\u2019re going to cut and cut substantially to be below the level that we have committed to on 30 November.\u201d Meanwhile Iraq\u2019s oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi told Reuters it was committed to complying with the pact, although it was confident it had the potential to raise output in the future. He said: \u201cThe cuts will aim at the figures we agreed with Opec definitely, but (for) the areas of the cuts there are many options on the table.\u201d Despite the prospect of US shale producers continuing to raise their own output levels, analysts believe the oil price has further to climb. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: \u201cMake no mistake about it \u2013 this historic agreement is a gamechanger. Although the crude oil rally has already started at the end of last month when the Opec first announced the deal, I think there is plenty of fuel left in this rally. \u201cAdmittedly, after a big gap we may see a retracement of some sort in prices now but ultimately the fundamentals still point to higher levels going forward. The oil market will now be balanced earlier than would have been the case without a deal. \u201cIt is very likely that US shale producers will take advantage of this opportunity to ramp up their crude output once again but this will be a worry for another day. \u201cOn top of the now-favourable supply-side dynamics, the global economic recovery is continuing at a steady pace, especially in the US. So rising demand for oil from the US \u2013 and China \u2013 could be additional factors that could help fuel a much larger rally in oil prices than many had envisaged a few months ago.\u201d News of the proposed cuts has benefited the rouble, sending the Russian currency up more than 2% against the dollar to a 14-month high despite the prospect of a US interest rate rise on Wednesday. Bond yields are falling on the expectation that the dearer oil price will feed through to higher inflation. Meanwhile commodity companies were among the biggest gainers on the stock market, with Royal Dutch B shares more than 3% higher and BP 2% better.",

      "bodyText": "Executives at Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) are fighting to salvage a multibillion-euro rescue by private investors in a frantic attempt to prop up the bank. In a statement released after a board meeting on Sunday, the world\u2019s oldest bank said it would forge ahead with a debt-for-equity swap offer for tens of thousands of retail investors. The offer still requires regulatory approval. If MPS manages to convince investors to go along with the plan, it would help it avoid a government bailout by Italy, which would have far-reaching economic and political consequences. A deal to prop up MPS was thrown into doubt last week after the European Central Bank (ECB) reportedly said it could not have more time to secure the private investment. MPS had sought an extension until 20 January. Markets are now waiting to hear the future of a planned \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.2bn) cash injection by private investors to rescue the bank by 31 December. Reports of the ECB\u2019s decision, which were released on Friday and not publicly confirmed, have raised fears that MPS would not be able to secure the private funds in time and that it would therefore require a \u201cprecautionary recapitalisation\u201d \u2013 or rescue \u2013 by Italy. The fate of MPS is critical for a number of reasons. It is Italy\u2019s third largest bank and a failure to secure the private funds would immediately raise doubts about the stability of a number of other Italian banks, such as UniCredit, which also need to raise private capital. Any rescue of the institution by Italy under EU rules could lead to billions of euros in losses for retail investors, which in turn would damage the ruling Democratic party at a time when it has already been diminished by Matteo Renzi\u2019s resignation as prime minister last week following his defeat in a referendum on constitutional reforms. Under new EU rules, taxpayer funds cannot be used to rescue a bank unless bondholders take losses first. Italy could probably get the green light from Brussels to compensate certain junior bondholders, lessening the damage to investors and the political fallout, but the details of any such agreement are far from clear. Analysts said any such arrangement would involve refunding investors who fall below certain thresholds in terms of income and wealth. Shares in MPS closed down 10% on Friday following reports of the ECB\u2019s decision. The ECB refused to comment and gave no formal confirmation to MPS, but its decision may have closed the door to a private-sector solution under which major investors, including the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, would invest \u20ac5bn in cash. Federico Santi, an analyst at Eurasia Group, said that state support would likely be forthcoming if the private-sector solution failed to materialise. Santi said any amount of \u201cburden sharing\u201d or losses inflicted on junior bondholders would be hugely unpopular and a serious blow to the government. He said that it might nevertheless be easier for an incoming government led by the prime minister-designate, Paolo Gentiloni, to take unpopular measures, since Renzi would still want to lead his party into elections. A new poll is expected to be called early next year. Lorenzo Codogno, chief economist at LC Macro Advisors, said: \u201cNow that the political situation is about to stabilise and a government will be in office on Tuesday, the solution for MPS could equally be in sight, but it is still not clear whether a private solution is still feasible or, more likely, some public money would be necessary. \u201cThe problems of Italian banks will continue to drag on for months, if not years, but at least a framework would be in place to address the most pressing issues. It is now the final countdown.\u201d The country\u2019s third-largest lender has already been bailed out twice in modern Italian history, but it became clear after Britain\u2019s vote to exit the EU, which sent shockwaves across financial markets, that the Siena bank would require a third bailout. The bank\u2019s financial problems are nothing new. Italian banks have been weighed down by \u20ac360bn of non-performing loans that were mostly taken out by small Italian businesses which have been battered by years of recession. Italy returned to growth in 2015, but the improvements are only modest and the International Monetary Fund predicted that GDP would not likely return to pre-crisis levels until the mid-2020s. MPS\u2019s issues were exacerbated by other mistakes \u2013 principally a poorly judged \u20ac9bn acquisition \u2013 but its primary issue is that billions of euros in loans were extended by the bank at a time when the scale of the impending recession was being underestimated.",

    "webTitle": "FCA fines on City fall to lowest level since financial crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fines imposed on banks and other City firms by the financial regulator have slumped to the lowest annual figure since the start of the financial crisis and less than 3% of last year\u2019s total. With a few working days left until the end of the year, the Financial Conduct Authority has dished out 23 fines worth \u00a322.2m, down from 40 in 2015 when the total was \u00a3905m. The total fell because blockbuster fines doled out in the past two years for banks\u2019 rigging of foreign exchange markets and the benchmark Libor interest rate were not repeated. The FCA\u2019s fines go to the Treasury, which has used them partly to fund worthy causes. Aviva received the biggest fine of 2016 \u2013 \u00a38.2m for lax oversight of an outsourcer looking after clients\u2019 money. Aviva\u2019s penalty was dwarfed by the \u00a3284m handed to Barclays last year for foreign exchange manipulation. That record fine was more than 10 times the total for 2016. This year\u2019s figure is the lowest since 2007, when the FCA\u2019s predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, imposed \u00a35.3m of fines. The annual bill increased to \u00a322.7m in 2008 as the FSA responded to accusations of going soft on the City and rose each year to a peak of \u00a31.5bn in 2014. The slowdown in fines coincides with a turbulent period for the FCA that has left observers questioning its approach. Its former boss, Martin Wheatley, was forced out last year by the then chancellor George Osborne. Wheatley\u2019s uncompromising stance alienated the City. After banks waged a campaign for less aggressive regulation, Osborne declared after the 2015 election he wanted a more harmonious settlement with the financial industry. Andrew Bailey, who took over as the FCA\u2019s chief executive in July, said the drop-off in fines should not be read as a softening of the regulator\u2019s approach. Bailey said: \u201cIf we were to maintain the level that we had a few years ago, it would imply we were having something on the level of Libor and foreign exchange every year. If that happened, we would be asking ourselves: \u2018What is going on?\u2019 We would need a major blowup every year to maintain that level of activity and that isn\u2019t our objective.\u201d When Osborne recruited Bailey from the Bank of England, where he ran its regulatory division for three years, banks hoped he would be less confrontational than Wheatley. Peter Snowdon, a partner at the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said: \u201cCity firms think there has been a change in approach and that the new regime wants to be seen as less strident than the last one. Even taking into account the very large fines last year, that change is arguably reflected in the drop-off in fines.\u201d This year was also the first since 2007 that no UK bank was fined. The big four lenders \u2013 Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays \u2013 have paid out almost \u00a31.4bn since 2007, peaking in 2014 when all four were penalised and their fines amounted to \u00a3659m. The banks have paid big fines for shoddy treatment of retail customers as well as for manipulating markets. James Daley, the managing director of consumer group Fairer Finance, said: \u201cThe level of enforcement and fines we saw during the Wheatley era was probably about right and slowly we are seeing banks starting to slip back into bad habits. The sector has got miles to go before we can say it\u2019s serving consumers well and the regulator has got as big a task as it had five years ago.\u201d The FCA has taken a tough line on some matters since Bailey took over. In August, it extended the deadline for claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance, increasing the likely cost to the banks. Last month, it proposed measures to increase competition between fund managers and it announced clampdowns last week on the spread-betting industry and crowdfunding. Snowdon said: \u201cWhere they think they have identified inappropriate behaviour in the market, they are quite focused on it. Maybe they are shifting their emphasis to intervene earlier in the process rather than just fining people.\u201d The fall in fines could reduce the amount available to the chancellor for supporting good causes. In 2012, Osborne diverted fines, previously used to fund the FCA, to the Treasury and pledged to use the money for armed forces charities and the emergency services. In last month\u2019s autumn statement, Philip Hammond, Osborne\u2019s replacement, said \u00a3102m of Libor fines would be used for good causes. The Treasury has received about \u00a33bn from the FCA since the rule change. Any money not allocated for specific causes is used for general spending.

      "bodyText": "The UK economy will slow markedly next year as uncertainty about the country\u2019s future position in Europe and higher inflation hit consumers and businesses, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has predicted. The business group believes the UK will avoid recession but still lose momentum as the weak pound pushes up import costs and the resulting rise in inflation erodes people\u2019s spending power. New figures from the British Retail Consortium and Springboard suggest that consumers may already be becoming more cautious. Visitors to the high street and shopping centres fell in November despite shops cutting prices as part of the Black Friday promotional event. Footfall fell 1% to retail destinations year on year as consumers spent money online instead. This compares with a 0.9% drop in October. In new forecasts published on Monday, the BCC has upgraded its outlook for GDP growth this year to 2.1% from 1.8%, to reflect a stronger-than-expected performance from the economy in the months following the Brexit vote. It has also nudged up its forecast for 2017 growth to 1.1% from the 1% forecast in September but that would still represent the weakest growth since the financial crisis. The group downgraded its growth forecast for 2018 to 1.4% from 1.8% on the expectation that higher inflation would curb household consumption and that the UK would see more muted levels of investment, particularly business investment. Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC, said: \u201cIn the absence of a clear road ahead, many companies have been adopting a \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach in the months since the referendum, which has kept conditions buoyant this year and prevented a sharp slowdown in growth. \u201cWhile some firms see significant opportunities over the coming months, many others now see increasing uncertainty, which is weighing on their investment expectations and forward confidence. Lower sterling and rising inflation are now starting to affect business communities and consumers across the UK.\u201d The BCC said based on the available economic news and its own survey of businesses, it did not expect the economy to fall into a recession \u2013 something groups such as the International Monetary Fund had warned was a risk in the event of a vote for Brexit. The BCC is forecasting the public finances will be in worse shape as a result of an economic slowdown hitting tax receipts, undershooting the already downbeat expectations of the fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility . The business group expects inflation to breach the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target next year, with a forecast of 2.1% in 2017 and reaching 2.4% in 2018. Inflation was 0.9% on the last available figures from October, and November figures due on Tuesday are expected to show it edging up to 1.1%. Business investment is expected to fall by 0.8% in 2016, 2.1% in 2017 and 0.3% in 2018 \u2013 better than the previous forecasts for sharper falls in 2016 and 2017, but significantly worse than the 1.9% growth previously predicted for 2018. The group also warned export growth was set to slow over the coming years before edging up again in 2018. It said the effect on exports of the falling value of the pound, which makes UK goods cheaper in overseas markets, had previously been overstated. \u201cWhile a lower pound is a boon for some exporting businesses, many others see the latest devaluation of sterling less positively, as they are unable to benefit from it,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cGiven our findings, deeper incentives for both investment and exporting will be needed in the months and years ahead. As the Brexit negotiations commence, steps will need to be taken to help ambitious firms overcome the risks, real and perceived, born out of political uncertainty.\u201d",

Analysis by the thinktank New Financial looked at internal data from 71 companies that have signed up to the Treasury\u2019s Women in Finance charter, which works with firms to improve gender balance in British financial services. The companies \u2013 which include Barclays, HSBC, and London Stock Exchange Group \u2013 shared data confidentially with the Treasury, which anonymised it before passing it to New Financial to analyse. The report found that the average company target for the number of women at senior management level was 35% by 2020, up from the current average of 27%. The percentage of women at a senior level in the firms analysed, which had not already met their targets, ranged from 10% to 47%. Half of the signatories of the charter have between 20% and 40% of senior roles held by women, and 10 have parity, or more women than men in those roles. The companies\u2019 ambitions varied greatly, with targets ranging from 21% to 50%, and 15 firms aiming for at least 50% female senior management. Britain\u2019s banking giants have set the most ambitious gender diversity targets, according to the report, aiming to increase the number of senior women by an average of 40% over the next five years, from an an average of 23%. Medium-sized businesses, with between 500 to 1,000 employees, faced the steepest climb, with an aim to increase the number of women at senior management level by nearly 50%. While two-thirds of signatories named a man as their executive accountable for diversity, a fifth of signatories (15 firms) have already met or exceeded their targets. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money and the government\u2019s Women in Finance champion, said: \u201cIt is important that the next generation of women working in finance have the opportunity to break the glass ceiling and get to the top. \u201cAchieving a balanced workforce at all levels in financial services will undoubtedly improve culture, profitability and productivity, and I am delighted to see so many positive role models here today to mentor and encourage women just starting out with their careers.\u201d The average pay gap between men and women stands at 18.1%, the lowest level since records began, according to the Office for National Statistics.",

    "webTitle": "West Midlands is now employment blackspot, says thinktank", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The West Midlands has become an employment blackspot and is badly trailing behind other parts of the UK on job creation and living standards, a leading think tank has warned. These considerations pushed the region into voting to leave the European Union, said the Resolution Foundation. The West Midlands now has the lowest employment rate of any other big city region \u2013 64.5% compared with an average of 70.9% \u2013 and lags behind the UK average on growth, pay and income. The thinktank called on government to do more to help Birmingham and the surrounding area and said the new metro mayor for the West Midlands, who will be elected next May, must prioritise creating high-quality jobs, improving productivity, and tackling a long-standing skills shortages. The West Midlands delivered the strongest vote to leave the EU of any region in the UK once characteristics such as age and income were discounted. Walsall, Sandwell and Dudley particularly supported Brexit. Resolution said there were strong links between pro-leave sentiment and the employment problems, which stretch back to before the 2008 global financial crisis. Conor D\u2019Arcy, author of the report and a policy analyst at Resolution, said: \u201cThe West Midlands\u2019 terrible record on job creation has created a huge employment blackspot and was a key factor behind its overwhelming vote to leave the EU. \u201cTurning the city region\u2019s economic prospects around will be a huge task facing the new mayor, and they should have the full backing of central government too. Whitehall should recalibrate its flagship Midlands engine project to supporting the new mayor in overseeing a long overdue jobs boom across the West Midlands.\u201d The region, which has a population of 4 million and encompasses Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton, entered the downturn with the lowest employment rate of any city region. Employment prospects have only improved at a \u201cglacial pace\u201d since, Resolution said, despite success stories such as the revival of Jaguar Land Rover. The region\u2019s employment rate had grown by about half the average for city regions in the UK. If the West Midlands had kept pace with the average, an additional 114,000 people would now have a job. D\u2019Arcy added: \u201cFor years the West Midlands has been ignored as previous governments have focused on making London the financial capital of the world and Manchester a \u2018northern powerhouse\u2019. It\u2019s high time Birmingham and the Black Country are brought out of the shadows and made the focus of a national renaissance for Britain\u2019s major cities.\u201d The report found one of the fastest growth areas for employment had been work via agencies, an area that has come under scrutiny recently for its failure to provide a decent living or economic security to workers. \u201cIn contrast to trends across the UK and its cities, managers now make up a smaller proportion of the workforce than they did in 2008 while the share of professionals has remained flat against rapid increases elsewhere,\u201d Resolution said. The researchers also found that employment problems spread across the region. Solihull was the only local authority to have a higher employment rate than the UK\u2019s city region average. Birmingham was the worst performing part of the West Midlands, followed by Walsall. The report highlighted three groups experiencing particular troubles finding work: young people, BAME workers \u2013 black, Asian or minority ethnic \u2013 and low-qualified workers. It noted that barely half of all young people aged 16-29 were in work and urged policymakers to prioritise support for those disadvantaged groups with back-to-work programmes and other schemes. Despite its gloomy findings, the thinktank said there were still grounds for optimism that things could change under the the new mayor, who will have responsibility for transport, adult skills and planning, and will oversee a \u00a31.1bn, 30-year investment fund. One area where policymakers could make big progress, it said, was encouraging those who graduate from the region\u2019s universities to stay on there. The West Midlands has the highest proportion of students of any city region and retaining them by providing high-skill job opportunities would boost productivity and create spillover benefits for local non-graduates.",

      "body": "<p>The West Midlands has become an employment blackspot and is badly trailing behind other parts of the UK on job creation and living standards, a leading think tank has warned. </p> <p>These considerations pushed the region into voting to leave the European Union, said the Resolution Foundation.</p> <p>The West Midlands now has the lowest employment rate of any other big city region \u2013 64.5% compared with an average of 70.9% \u2013 and lags behind the UK average on growth, pay and income.</p> <p>The thinktank called on government to do more to help Birmingham and the surrounding area and said the new metro mayor for the West Midlands, who will be elected next May, must prioritise creating high-quality jobs, improving productivity, and tackling a long-standing skills shortages.</p> <p>The West Midlands delivered the strongest vote to leave the EU of any region in the UK once characteristics such as age and income were discounted. Walsall, Sandwell and Dudley particularly supported Brexit. Resolution said there were strong links between <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/16/leave-or-remain-black-country-businessmen-argue-for-and-against-brexit\">pro-leave sentiment</a> and the employment problems, which stretch back to before the 2008 global financial crisis.</p> <p>Conor D\u2019Arcy, author of the report and a policy analyst at Resolution, said: \u201cThe West Midlands\u2019 terrible record on job creation has created a huge employment blackspot and was a key factor behind its overwhelming vote to leave the EU.</p> <p>\u201cTurning the city region\u2019s economic prospects around will be a huge task facing the new mayor, and they should have the full backing of central government too. Whitehall should recalibrate its flagship Midlands engine project to supporting the new mayor in overseeing a long overdue jobs boom across the West Midlands.\u201d</p> <p>The region, which has a population of 4 million and encompasses Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton, entered the downturn with the lowest employment rate of any city region. Employment prospects have only improved at a \u201cglacial pace\u201d since, Resolution said, despite success stories such as the revival of Jaguar Land Rover.</p> <p>The region\u2019s employment rate had grown by about half the average for city regions in the UK. If the West Midlands had kept pace with the average, an additional 114,000 people would now have a job.</p> <p>D\u2019Arcy added: \u201cFor years the West Midlands has been ignored as previous governments have focused on making London the financial capital of the world and Manchester a \u2018northern powerhouse\u2019. It\u2019s high time Birmingham and the Black Country are brought out of the shadows and made the focus of a national renaissance for Britain\u2019s major cities.\u201d</p> <p>The report found one of the fastest growth areas for employment had been work via agencies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/britains-agency-workers-underpaid-and-exploited-thinktank-says\">an area that has come under scrutiny recently</a> for its failure to provide a decent living or economic security to workers.</p> <p>\u201cIn contrast to trends across the UK and its cities, managers now make up a smaller proportion of the workforce than they did in 2008 while the share of professionals has remained flat against rapid increases elsewhere,\u201d Resolution said.</p> <p>The researchers also found that employment problems spread across the region. Solihull was the only local authority to have a higher employment rate than the UK\u2019s city region average. Birmingham was the worst performing part of the West Midlands, followed by Walsall.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The report highlighted three groups experiencing particular troubles finding work: young people, BAME workers \u2013 black, Asian or minority ethnic \u2013 and low-qualified workers. It noted that barely half of all young people aged 16-29 were in work and urged policymakers to prioritise support for those disadvantaged groups with back-to-work programmes and other schemes. <br></p> <p>Despite its gloomy findings, the thinktank said there were still grounds for optimism that things could change under the the new mayor, who will have responsibility for transport, adult skills and planning, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/labour-announce-candidates-mayor-greater-manchester-west-midlands\">will oversee a \u00a31.1bn, 30-year investment fund</a>.</p> <p>One area where policymakers could make big progress, it said, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/21/london-one-quarter-graduates-uk-universities-centre-for-cities-report\">encouraging those who graduate from the region\u2019s universities to stay on there</a>. The West Midlands has the highest proportion of students of any city region and retaining them by providing high-skill job opportunities would boost productivity and create spillover benefits for local non-graduates.</p>",
