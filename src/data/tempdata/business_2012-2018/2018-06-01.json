      "bodyText": "Visa says the widespread outage which affected customers in the UK, Europe and abroad was caused by a \u201chardware failure\u201d and was not the result of unauthorised access. Cardholders can now use their Visa cards, with services now operating at \u201cclose to normal levels\u201d. Chip and pin transactions were affected, but ATM withdrawals were not. American Express and Mastercard were running a normal service throughout. The outage is believed to have started at around 2:30pm Disgruntled customers at supermarkets, petrol stations and abroad vented their frustrations on social media when there was little information from the financial services firm. Bank transactions were also hit. Experts have advised consumers to carry backup payment options, while Which? warned consumers to be \u201cextra wary\u201d of calls and emails relating to the network failure. Visa said the outage was caused by a hardware failure and was not a result of \u201cunauthorised access or malicious event\u201d. Five hours after an initial statement, the company said its payment systems were almost back to normal. The firm apologised to its customers after it admitted it fell \u201cwell short\u201d of its reliability targets today. Here is their latest statement: Earlier today, Visa had a system failure that impacted customers across Europe. Our goal is to ensure all Visa cards work reliably 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We fell well short of this goal today and we apologise to all of our partners, and most especially, to Visa cardholders. Visa cardholders can now use their Visa cards as we are currently operating at close to normal levels. The issue was the result of a hardware failure. We have no reason to believe this was associated with any unauthorised access or malicious event. UK Finance, a trade association which represents leading firms in the payments industry, said: Visa is currently experiencing a service disruption which is preventing some Visa transactions in Europe from being processed. It is investigating the cause and acting as quickly as possible to resolve the situation. Visa is working with banks, building societies, merchant acquirers and card providers to return to a normal service and will provide regular updates. Customers should check their bank, building society or card provider website or contact them with any queries. Which? has warned that the widespread network failure could attract scammers and advised people to be \u201cextra wary\u201d of calls or emails related to the outage. Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: Clearly this issue will be a huge inconvenience to customers and it must be resolved urgently. Visa and the banks need to ensure no-one is left out of pocket due to this outage. We strongly advise people to keep any evidence of extra expenses they\u2019ve incurred in order to claim them back.\u201d Guardian Money\u2019s Miles Brignall has just returned from the Morrisons supermarket in Letchworth. It\u2019s cash only signs up. Plenty of shoppers have abandoned their baskets. Others are queuing up outside the ATMs outside the building. Everyone\u2019s pretty good natured considering. He says he was able to pay using a MasterCard and had no problems. Amex was also being taken but no Visa cards. Readers have been getting in touch with their experiences. Although the outage appears to have struck at around 2:30pm, one reader said she was unable to use her Visa debit at lunchtime. Rebecca Rapport said: My Visa debit was declined in M&amp;S in the City at about 13:15 today. The sales assistant thought it was the card machine so I used Apple Pay. Sounds like this has been happening earlier than reported. Rich Dunning, an administrator at the University of Liverpool who is currently working in the US with a colleague, had his card declined. We\u2019re currently in the US for work and all our Visa work cards were declined, so it looks like the outage seems to be affecting cards being used outside Europe, too. Luckily I had some dollars in cash from earlier and a colleague has a MasterCard so we\u2019re not totally stuck! Amid a lack of information at a the supermarket till, reader Fiona Hillhouse had to make various enquiries at Asda and her bank before being told about the problem. My husband and I had nipped to Asda earlier to get some shopping. My husband used his card to pay and checkout assistant declared it was declined. They tried three times, so I ran out to the car to get my card which I\u2019d used just before to pay the hygienist. We have a joint account so I used my card - declined too. The none-to-helpful checkout assistant told us to take it up with the bank. How could both cards not be working? And how were we going to pay for our shopping? My husband used his credit card. Got home. Phoned the bank, waited half an hour to speak to someone. Account was fine it must be Asda\u2019s machines. Phoned Asda. Was advised it was a problem with Visa. Could they not have told us that instead of making us feel mortified as if we didn\u2019t have money in our bank account in front of a queue of customers. I\u2019m just relieved someone hasn\u2019t emptied our bank account! Guy Anker, the deputy editor of consumer website MoneySavingExpert.com, criticised the network failure in an age when we \u201crely so heavily on technology\u201d for basic purchases. After TSB\u2019s IT meltdown, this is yet another big banking or payment systems problem for people to have to deal with. It\u2019s simply not good enough in this day and age when we rely so heavily on technology to conduct what are pretty basic things such as buying a drink or a meal. If you\u2019re going out or making a payment online over the weekend, have a look at what\u2019s in your wallet and ensure if you\u2019ve a MasterCard or Amex you take that out or use it. And until this is fixed cash is king if you\u2019re spending out and about, so ensure you\u2019ve enough to get by on in case your cards don\u2019t work. As this is about processing credit or debit card transactions it shouldn\u2019t affect standing orders, direct debits or bank transfers. Peter Hahn, the professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking and Finance, said consumers should be prepared for the possibility of \u201ccyber risks\u201d at all times by having backup payment options. He told Sky News: In today\u2019s world, with cyber risks, everyone really needs to always be carrying two means to make a payment. That almost means you should have two bank accounts. Cyber risks can happen really anywhere. Visa - we tend to think of it as a bank, but for most of us what it means is that it\u2019s a communications network. We have a bank that we\u2019re going to have a credit card from, stores have their banks, and Visa is really the connection between those banks. And it\u2019s got lots of entry points that can be challenged so hopefully they\u2019ve got the expertise to fix those systems quickly. There have been no further updates from Visa since an initial statement sent more than two hours ago. Here is what we know so far. Labour MP Angela Rayner appears to have been affected during a visit to her local garage: Business owners and shoppers out in Broomhill in west Sheffield seemed intensely relaxed about the Visa machine difficulties. \u201cI usually just pay by cash anyway,\u201d said Mandy Stevens, as she came out of Morrisons with her shopping. The store had problems taking card payments all afternoon, with customers going outside and waiting patiently to take money out of a cash point, before returning. Stevens, who runs the SM Hair hairdressers across the road, said the first thing she knew of the troubles had been when a client asked if her machine was working because he had read the news. Her salon\u2019s machine was working fine on Friday. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just certain types of machines or certain places that are having trouble,\u201d she said. Most businesses on Broomhill\u2019s high street reported having some problems taking card payments on Friday afternoon. Richard Stacey from the Record Collector record shop said it had been a quiet day anyway, so the difficulties had not damaged business. A barista at Costa Coffee said he had heard that nearby cash machines were running out of money, which could cause difficulties if the problems persisted. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what tomorrow brings\u201d, he said. Remo Sineone, who runs Remo\u2019s, a cafe and deli, said he had been having particular trouble taking contactless payments on Friday afternoon. \u201cShort term, I can\u2019t really see it being much of a problem to be honest,\u201d he said. Hello, I\u2019ll be on the liveblog this evening. Do get in touch with your Visa outage stories here: isabel.togoh.casual@guardian.co.uk. One British traveller in Sicily has tweeted Visa for help because they cannot pay for train tickets to Palermo to get their flights. Twitter user Oscar Pratelli also stated that he was stranded. Broadcaster Jay Curtis tweeted that he had two Visa payments declined and was put on hold for 40 minutes, only to be told there was a Europe-wide problem. Staff in John Lewis in St Pancras station said Visa payments had been going down sporadically since about 4pm. \u201cSometimes it works, but a lot of transactions have been failing,\u201d Pedro Rodriguez, a sales assistant, said. \u201cMore than 10 transactions have failed. One lady had to call her bank and was quite upset, but most people have a MasterCard as well or cash so it\u2019s ok.\u201d Boots staff said the problem only appeared to effect PIN-number transactions and people were still able to pay for purchases below \u00a330. Thameslink and East Midlands Trains staff said they were not aware of people having difficulties buying tickets. Lisa Eagleton-Muir, 44, had come to London to audition for the Great British Sewing Bee, but could not buy any food at Kings Cross station for the train back to Newcastle. \u201cI\u2019ve only got two cards and they\u2019re both Visa. I tried to buy my tea in M&amp;S and a cafe but they were both rejected. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. It\u2019s a long journey home with no food.\u201d Luckily she was able to withdraw cash from the a cash machine. Paperchase in the station said it had stopped taking any card payments following repeated cancellations. \u201cI tried all my cards and none of them work, I\u2019m going to be really late for my train,\u201d said Alison Merritt Smith, 31, an arts producer. \u201cThe queues are intense in M&amp;S. But the are dealing with it fantastically.\u201d A range of companies have issued statements saying they are having problems with payments: Sainsbury\u2019s said: This seems to be affecting different customers cards in different ways but we are not experiencing significant issues currently. Train operator GWR said its ticket booths and vending machines were not able to accept Visa cards. A spokesman said that onboard train staff were aware of the issue and it was possible for passengers to buy tickets on the train with cash. We encourage passengers to use cash to buy tickets at ticket offices or the machines before they travel. We are taking steps to make ticket buying as easy as possible for passengers at this time. Wetherspoons confirmed it was suffering from \u201cintermittent Visa card issues\u201d which were affecting all cards processed by chip and pin or its mobile app. The pub group is asking customers to use an alternative card provider or cash. A TfL spokesperson said: Customers using contactless payment cards should be able to carry on using our Tube, bus and rail services as normal. We are monitoring the situation in close collaboration with our payments providers. In Spain, the guardia civil sent a tweet aimed at reassuring those affected by the system failure. Beneath a picture of Johnny Depp as a shocked Captain Jack Sparrow, the force said: \u201cStay calm. If you can\u2019t pay it\u2019s not because you\u2019ve been robbed or hacked. Visa is suffering a service crash in Europe that\u2019s stopping payments going through in its cards. A spokesman for supermarket chain Asda said problems with payments had been happening in stores across the country sporadically since 3pm on Friday. Some payments were going through but some were not, he said. Customers are being told that cash is the best way to pay. \u201cWhen you try and pay something, it sends a message to Visa and then Visa have to send a message back to the chip and pin machine to say this is OK and then the banks are in between at some point. The message that is coming back to the chip and pin, that is where the fault is. \u201cWe are advising customers that cash is the best way to buy your shopping because you can still get cash out with [a] debit card. In Scotland, some supermarkets say Visa is working sporadically and they are opening cash-only tills. Frances, a check out manager at Morrison\u2019s in Anniesland, Glasgow, has been giving out old-style hand-held card machines and paper authentication slips to check out staff, as well as opening more cash-only tills. She says that the outage has been coming in waves, so it is hard to know whether the cards will work or not. Customers are still getting served reasonably quickly though, despite the added delay of calling up to authenticate individual cards. Not quickly enough for Shelley, who was shopping with her two nephews having run out of milk during a babysitting session. She was flustered trying to pay her bill and then add the extra value points to her loyalty card at the customer service desk. The visa outage seems to be by no means uniform, and other stores across the shopping precinct reported no problems at all this afternoon. Banks have been apologising to irate customers for ongoing payment issues. A spokesperson for Royal Bank of Scotland said: We are aware that some customers are experiencing issues using their debit cards. We apologies to customers for the inconvenience and we are working with our suppliers to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Customers are still able to access cash through the ATM network. Some payments were being processed through RBS but it was not clear how many and how many were encountering problems. Lloyds Bank said: We are aware of an industry wide issue effecting Visa payments which is under investigation. ATM and Mastercard transactions are not impacted. We are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment on the matter and directed calls to Visa. We are leaving it to Visa to explain what the issue is. There has been no update from Visa since it posted this tweet just before 5pm on Friday Visa card users are experiencing widespread problems making online payments across the UK and in Europe. Visa said some card payments were failing and itwas investigating the cause of the disruption. Many customers have used Twitter to express their frustration and concern that their card payments are being denied. \u201cWe are investigating the cause and working as quickly as possible to resolve the situation,\u201d Visa said in a statement. It is understood that the problem to be limited to Visa card payments only. Several banks have used Twitter to tell customers that they are having some issues processing Visa payments. HSBC said they were \u201cslowly recovering\u201d while First Bank told customers there weren\u2019t \u201cany timescales for resolution at the moment\u201d. We\u2019re going to keep you up to date with all the developments as they happen.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Football fans heading to the World Cup this summer are going to get an education in Chinese TVs, mobile phones, electric scooters and Mongolian dairy products. As western companies, including Sony, Johnson &amp; Johnson and BP\u2019s Castrol, have pulled out of sponsoring the tournament after the Fifa bribery and corruption scandal, Chinese firms have secured an unprecedented presence at Russia 2018. When Russia kicks off against Saudi Arabia in the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow on 14 June, fans will be treated to a seven-minute advert for Mengniu Group\u2019s inner Mongolian milk and drinkable yoghurt. The commercial will be aired during each of the 64 games in the tournament. Spectators fancying an ice-cream will have to pick from unfamiliar names such as Mood for Green, Ice+ or Suibian SuiXinGuo, after Mengniu secured exclusive rights to sell sweet treats including yoghurt drinks in the stadiums. Other unfamiliar names to get to grips with during the month-long tournament include: Vivo, a mobile phone firm producing China\u2019s version of the iPhone at a fraction of the price; the TV and fridge maker Hisense; the electric scooter company Yadea; and Dalian Wanda, a conglomerate controlled by the multibillionaire Wang Jianlin. The dominating presence of Chinese brands comes despite the country\u2019s national team failing to qualify for Russia 2014 or the previous World Cup in Brazil. Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University, said: \u201cAs Fifa is now seen as a toxic brand that many western companies do not want to be associated with, China is seizing the opportunity. \u201cThe Chinese view of ethics and governance is different to western standards, and it is very easy for Chinese companies to say \u2018Fifa has moved on\u2019. And, that they were not backing the Sepp Blatter-era regime and are supporting a clean Fifa under Gianni Infantino [who replaced Blatter in 2016].\u201d Chadwick said the lack of demand from western companies to sponsor the World Cup in Russia, and Qatar in 2022, has left Fifa \u201cdesperate for cash, and Chinese companies spotted the opportunity for a relatively cost-effective way to get their brands in front of billions of global eyeballs\u201d. Wang, the fifth-richest person in China with a $23.4bn (\u00a317.6bn) fortune, according to Bloomberg\u2019s billionaires index, said: \u201cTwo or three years ago, Chinese and Asian companies probably wouldn\u2019t even have had a chance to sponsor Fifa even if we wanted to. But because some western companies dropped out, we got the opportunity.\u201d Wanda, which owns the British luxury yacht builder Sunseeker, the Hollywood studio that made Godzilla and The Hangover as well as a stake in Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, has signed up as a Fifa partner \u2013 the highest level of sponsorship \u2013 alongside Coca-Cola, Visa, Adidas and Russia\u2019s Gazprom for the next four World Cups. \u201cIf more Chinese brother companies become Fifa sponsors like Wanda, we will join forces to advance the interests of China soccer,\u201d Wang said. Chadwick said the Chinese companies\u2019 Fifa sponsorship deals were encouraged by President Xi Jinping to help fuel his dream of turning China into a \u201cworld football superpower\u201d by 2050. \u201cChina wants to host the the World Cup, China wants to win the World Cup, and I speculate they also want a Chinese president of Fifa,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cRescuing Fifa financially with these sponsorship deals will help the chances of achieving those dreams immeasurably.\u201d After TV rights sales, sponsorship is Fifa\u2019s biggest income stream and was worth $1.6bn for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The loss of sponsors and the struggle to sign deals after the bribery scandal dragged Fifa to a record $369m loss in 2016. Jon Tibbs, founder and chair of JTA, a sports reputation management company, said it was sensible of Chinese firms to use football for promotion. \u201cAs the traditional western brands get cold feet and face consumers\u2019 pressure, it is inevitable that Fifa turns to new markets,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Chinese brands seeking new markets it is relatively very easy and prestigious to partner with Fifa. It is widely believed that China will bid for the 2030 World Cup, obviously if there are a large number of Chinese sponsors helping to prop up Fifa that is a very good starting point.\u201d Sam Burne James, news editor of PR Week, said Fifa was \u201ccertainly seen as toxic\u201d by many British brands, and Boris Johnson\u2019s comparison of the World Cup under Vladimir Putin to the 1936 Olympic Games under Hitler had not helped. \u201cIf you look at few tournaments back, most of the brands would be recognisable to western audiences, now several of them are unheard of \u2013 and that shift will continue,\u201d he said. \u201cChinese companies get two things from sponsoring the World Cup. The first is access to western audiences that they will sooner or later be trying to win over, as their companies expand. The other is a cosmopolitan veneer to their brands, which they hope will resonate with their sizeable domestic markets.\u201d Vivo, founded nine years ago, paid \u20ac400m (\u00a3350m) for a six-year deal that included Russia 2018, Qatar 2022 and the Confederations Cup. It has signed up the Brazilian footballer Jos\u00e9 Roberto Gama de Oliveira - better known as Bebeto \u2013 and Holland\u2019s Ruud Gullit to front its World Cup campaign \u2013 and its advertising campaign video, launched this week, sums up the opportunity the Chinese corporate sponsors are trying to grab: \u201cThe world is watching,\u201d Vivo said. \u201cThis is our moment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An independent panel advising the World Health Organization has stopped short of recommending taxing sugary drinks to reduce obesity after failing to reach a consensus. Some countries, such as Mexico, France and Britain, are already taxing sugary drinks and the WHO made a non-binding recommendation in October 2016 that governments should impose a 20% tax. While the industry called this \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and \u201cunproven\u201d, activists had hoped for a strong endorsement from the panel, which includes heads of states and health ministers. The panel on Friday called on governments to increase efforts to fight an epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in low- and middle-income countries, which account for 71% of all deaths globally, or 41 million deaths a year. WHO\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, established the WHO Independent High-Level Commission on Noncommunicable Diseases last year to provide advice on how to reduce premature deaths from such diseases by a third by 2030. To achieve progress, \u201cgovernments should work with: food and non-alcoholic beverage companies in areas such as reformulation, labelling, and regulating marketing\u201d, said its report, which goes to a United Nations summit in September. The commission made six recommendations in its report, including for government heads to take responsibility for disease reduction and to increase regulation. It did not mention taxes specifically. The panel said its 21 members represented \u201crich and diverse views\u201d, but that some views were \u201cconflicting\u201d. As a result, it said recommendations around sugar taxes and the accountability of the private sector could not be reflected in the report, despite broad support from many commissioners. A WHO spokesman insisted it still supported taxing sugary drinks. He said: \u201cThis is a report by an independent commission, not WHO. WHO stands by its evidence-based guidance, including on the benefits of using fiscal policies to reduce exposure to harmful products, including sugar-sweetened beverages.\u201d Ghebreyesus added: \u201cWHO\u2019s position cannot change because of this report. What WHO said some years ago holds, because consumption of sugar is associated with obesity and at the same time, taxing sugar was shown to reduce consumption in many countries.\u201d NCDs are what health experts call illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, heart conditions, obesity and breathing problems that are not caused by infections and cannot be passed from person to person. Between them, they kill 41 million people a year worldwide. The view of the commission, set up to advise the WHO on how to tackle some of the world\u2019s most preventable killer diseases, is at odds with the WHO\u2019s previously strong support for sugar taxes. In 2016, it enthusiastically endorsed sugary drink taxes as a way of driving down sales, reducing their consumption and saving lives. Countries should consider introducing a tax on sugary drinks and set it at 20%, the WHO said. \u201cIf governments tax products like sugary drinks, they can reduce suffering and save lives. They can also cut healthcare costs and increase revenues to increase in health services,\u201d Dr Douglas Bettcher, the director of the WHO\u2019s department for the prevention of non-communicable diseases, said at the time. But the commission\u2019s report, released on Friday in Geneva and called Time to Deliver, explains that it does not include a sugar tax among its recommendations to reduce NCDs \u2013 aimed at governments and heads of state worldwide \u2013 because its members disagreed about it. In a message from its five co-chairs they admit: \u201cThere was broad agreement in most areas, but some views were conflicting and could not be resolved. As such, some recommendations, such as reducing sugar consumption through effective taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages and the accountability of the private sector, could not be reflected in this report, despite broad support from many [of the 21] commissioners.\u201d Anti-obesity campaigners reacted with dismay to the WHO commission\u2019s stance. Graham MacGregor, the chair of Action on Sugar, a London-based health charity, who is also a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, said: \u201cWhile the report makes a recommendation for governments to employ their regulatory and legislative powers to protect their populations, especially among children, the WHO has completely ignored any mention of a sugar tax on sugary drinks, despite a call by them for a 20% tax in 2016, which is completely scandalous and a very worrying U-turn. \u201cThey should also be recommending a 20% tax on all sweet and chocolate confectionery, the highest contributors of sugar in the British diet, and not pander to corporate lobbying.\u201d The Children\u2019s Food Campaign, a London-based alliance of health, education and children\u2019s organisations, called the failure to support a sugary drinks tax as \u201ca startling omission\u201d. It said: \u201cThere is a startling omission in relation to the turbo-charging power of fiscal measures such as the UK\u2019s soft drinks levy or sugary drinks tax which, according to Public Health England, has already achieved an 11% reduction in sugar levels in that category since 2015, compared to a pitiful 2% average reduction in sugar through the government\u2019s voluntary targets for the private sector. \u201cThis report appears to be rather sugar-shy when it comes to the bold recommendations the WHO director-general has called for.\u201d It dismissed the commission\u2019s recommendations as \u201cvague and lacklustre\u201d and out of step with the growing crackdown worldwide on sugar and junk food. In an evidence review it published in 2014 the WHO had also specifically endorsed a tax on sugary drinks, given their association with avoidable mortality from diabetes, stroke, heart attacks and cancer. \u201cParticular attention has been paid to taxing sugar-sweetened beverages as evidence suggests that such taxes could substantially reduce consumption and may contribute to a reduction in overweight and obesity\u201d, it concluded. The commission\u2019s five co-chairs were the presidents of Finland, Sri Lanka and Uruguay, a Russian health minister and former minister in Pakistan\u2019s government. The 21 commissioners included presidents, ex-presidents, current and former government ministers, academics, doctors and health experts from across the globe. They included Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York in 2001-13, who is now the WHO\u2019s global ambassador for NCDs and injuries.",

      "bodyText": "Mothercare is to close about 50 of its 137 stores by June next year with the potential loss of about 800 jobs after landlords approved a financial rescue package on Friday. Clive Whiley, the interim executive chairman of the struggling baby goods retailer, said the deal was a \u201ccrucial step forward to achieve the renewed and stable financial structure for the business that will drive an acceleration of Mothercare\u2019s transformation\u201d. The closures are another blow for troubled high streets around the country, which are facing an almost unprecedented retreat by household names struggling to adapt to changing consumer habits and the economic slowdown. A squeeze on shoppers\u2019 budgets, resulting from inflation on basic necessities including food and travel at a time of low wage growth, has combined with a switch to buying online and purchasing experiences rather than physical items, to make life tough for traditional shopkeepers. Marks &amp; Spencer has said it plans to close at least 100 stores by 2022, Toys R Us UK is closing all its 80-plus shops after going bust in February, while the fashion chain New Look and the flooring specialist Carpetright are shutting dozens of stores as they battle for survival. However, Mothercare shoppers in Wandsworth told the Guardian that the chain had also lost its edge amid new competition from the supermarkets and rivals such as Next as well as the ability to trade secondhand clothes online via sites such as Facebook or eBay. \u201cIt\u2019s old-fashioned, fuddy-duddy and a bit like a supermarket presentation, just no wow factor. They\u2019ve just held on to their reputation so long but haven\u2019t moved with the times,\u201d Siobhan Kane, a full-time mum, said. Laura Wingate, with her five-month-old son, said she was not impressed by customer service while the stores could be tricky to negotiate with a pram. \u201cMothercare is good quality, it\u2019s a staple, but in comparison with other places its not on the ball,\u201d she said. On Friday, more than three-quarters of Mothercare\u2019s independent creditors \u2013 including landlords and suppliers \u2013 backed the retailer\u2019s company voluntary arrangement (CVA) plan, a form of insolvency that enables retailers to exit unprofitable stores and reduce rents. Under the deal Mothercare asked for 65% rent reductions on 49 stores that are expected to close by next June and said it would halve rent paid on a further 21 outlets. The next stage of the group\u2019s survival plan involves Mothercare raising \u00a328m from shareholders, a condition of it securing \u00a367.5m in debt facilities to support the ongoing running of the business. Whiley said: \u201cWe are very grateful for the support of our many stakeholders across our creditor base in supporting today\u2019s CVA proposals. Their forbearance and support today is a crucial step forward to achieve the renewed and stable financial structure for the business that will drive an acceleration of Mothercare\u2019s transformation. \u201cThese measures provide a solid platform from which to reposition the group and begin to focus on growth, both in the UK and internationally.\u201d Securing the agreement on rent cuts and store closures comes despite fears of a push back from landlords, who have been faced with a string of CVAs in recent months. New Look, Carpetright and the restaurant chains Carluccio\u2019s, Byron, Prezzo and Jamie\u2019s Italian have used the process to jettison unwanted outlets. House of Fraser is expected to imminently announce details of a restructure under which at least 20 stores will close \u2013 a third of the group. The process is facing a potential delay amid wrangles with lenders and landlords over terms. There are fears the process could collapse as House of Fraser struggles to agree a deal at least two weeks before its next quarterly rental bill on 24 June. Charlotte Coates, a restructuring specialist at property advisory firm JLL, which is working with consultancy Begbies Traynor to advise a group of House of Fraser landlords, said they wanted more transparency on the terms of the deal. Landlords\u2019 concerns come as they face further potential CVAs in coming months. Hilco, the new owner of Homebase, is understood to be planning to close about 60 of the DIY chain\u2019s stores under a restructuring plan expected to be implemented over the summer. PoundWorld\u2019s private equity owner, TPG, is also weighing up a CVA if it is unable to find a buyer for the cut-price chain.

      "bodyText": "Investors pretty much knew that the US was about to slap steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Mexico and Canada, so in true market fashion, it was sell on the rumour and buy on the fact. The EU however said it was pressing ahead with a complaint to the World Trade Organisation about the US move, and had also opened a challenge against China over intellectual property. News that a week of political turmoil in Italy had ended with a new coalition government also helped sentiment, while the no confidence vote in Spain\u2019s (now ex) prime minister Rajoy was helped by the fact that a new euro-friendly administration was in place almost immediately. So markets are ending the week on a positive note, with Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 2.53%, Spain\u2019s Ibex 1.83% better and Germany\u2019s Dax ahead by 1.4%. In the UK the FTSE 100 is 0.5% higher, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 221 points or 0.9%. On the economic front, the US created more jobs than expected in May, something previewed by a Trump tweet ahead of the official release. In Europe, eurozone manufacturing fell to a 15 month low. In the UK, however, the latest manufacturing PMI survey came in slightly betteer than expected, although the recovery was said to be unconvincing. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. US factories grew strongly again last month, but slightly more slowly than expected. The final Markit manufacturing PMI came in at 56.4 compared to the intial estimate of 56.6 and April\u2019s figure of 56.5. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has spoken about the Trump tweet on the jobs figures: Despite the growing trade tensions after the US imposed its tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico, Wall Street has followed European markets higher, helped by a better than expected jobs figure. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 210 points or 0.86% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6% higher. Here is our story on the US jobs data, and the president commenting on the figures before their official release: Donald Trump broke with years of protocol on Friday, commenting on the US\u2019s latest jobs report an hour before its official release. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced at 8.30am that the US had added 223,000 new jobs in May as the unemployment rate slid t0 3.8%, its lowest level since April 2000 and one of the lowest levels since after the second world war. Trump, who has taken credit for job market growth despite the fact that it began under Obama, said on Twitter he was looking forward to the release of the monthly jobs report just over an hour ahead of its release. Following his tweet, treasury yields moved sharply higher. The monthly report is one of the most market sensitive pieces of economic information released by the government and is carefully guarded ahead of its release. For anyone other than the president, the comment would likely lead to an investigation or likely firing. The report is given to senior White House officials the day before its release but is usually closely protected. Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, said Trump should never again be given sight of the figures before their release. Our full story is here: And more Trump. The president has turned his attention back to trade, and Canada: Former US treasury secretary Summers has strong views on the Trump tweet which came ahead of the official announcement of the jobs numbers: More from ING Bank. Economist James Smith says the jobs data means a June rate hike is still on the cards. He said: Rising employment and an above-consensus wage growth figure will reinforce expectations for a rate rise in a couple of weeks, although Fed voters will also have a firm eye on the latest trade developments. President Trump said shortly before today\u2019s US jobs report that he was \u201clooking forward\u201d to seeing the numbers. And with the economy having added 223k jobs in May, he is likely to be fairly chuffed. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, a new post-crisis low, and in fact came within spitting distance of 3.7% once rounding is taken into consideration. This decline came as almost 300,000 job hunters found employment in May according to the household survey. But for the Fed, the key positive in this month\u2019s report is that wage growth beat estimates, taking the year-on-year rate back up to 2.7%. This comes as firms appear to be finding it harder to fill positions. The proportion of small businesses finding it hard to fill job openings continues to flirt with all-time highs, while it\u2019s taking around twice as long to fill vacancies than it did during depths of the financial crisis. We think wage growth could test 3% again this year as these skill shortages gradually filter through to the official numbers. All of this means that a rate hike is still highly likely from the Fed in a couple of weeks\u2019 time. Our base case is that the committee will hike a further two times after that in 2018, although of course there\u2019s no doubt that Fed officials will be keeping a firm eye on the brewing global trade war, and this is the main risk to our view. As far as the jobs numbers are concerned, we suspect it is probably too early to see the effect of Trump\u2019s metal tariffs in this month\u2019s data, but things could start to look a little more concerning over coming months. There are reportedly only around 300,000 workers directly employed in both the steel and aluminium production industries. By comparison, some estimates have put the number of jobs in companies reliant on steel/aluminium inputs at around 6.5 million \u2013 in industries covering aircraft to beer cans. On this basis, the risks stemming from the metals tariffs are likely to be a net negative for the overall jobs market. Here\u2019s ING strategist Viraj Patel on the US jobs numbers: The US unemployment rate has fallen to a new 18 year low of 3.8%, slightly better than the 3.9% expected. April\u2019s jobs figure was revised down from 164,000 - already weak - to 159,000 but March was higher than originally reported, up from 135,000 to 155,000. On the wages front, year on year earnings were up 2.7% compared to 2.6% in April, in line with forecasts. Month on month, wages grew by 0.3%, a little higher than the expected 0.2%. Perhaps no surprise given Trump\u2019s positive tweet, but the US jobs figures are much better than expected. Some 223,000 jobs were created in May compared to expectations of a 190,000 increase. Back with the EC, and commissioner Malmstrom says we are not in a trade war yet but in a very difficult situation brought on by the US. It is a very worrying situation, she says, it could escalate and the economic recovery risks being diminished by this. \u201c The US is playing a dangerous game here.\u201d Meanwhile, on the US jobs data which is due shortly, President Trump has tweeted about them ahead of time: On the US tariffs, she says the EU is talking to Canada, Mexico, as well as Japan. There might be others as well who will react. Malmstrom says the WTO| complaint about the US tariff will be made in the next few days, and the EU is also making a challenge against China on intellectual property. She says: We are not choosing any sides. We are determined to deal with the root causes of the current tension in the trade system. But we need to do that within the rules. Here\u2019s a link to the European Commission press conference by Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom on the response to the US tariffs. Here\u2019s Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable on the US tariffs, courtesty PA: As well as being petty and most probably illegal, Trump\u2019s trade war is ultimately self-defeating. In the inevitable retaliation, there will end up being tariffs on a plethora of US products from jeans to Trump Tower merchandise. This shows how absurd it is for the likes of [UK international trade secretary Liam] Fox to pin their hopes on - and entrust our economic future to - a bilateral trade deal with the US. We know he\u2019s illogical and stubborn, but he claims to be a good businessman. Trump must back down. Following the news of the US move, Fox had told Sky News the tariffs were \u201cpatently absurd\u201d but said they would not affect a post-Brexit trade deal between the US and UK. He said: The US administration has made clear again this week that they are very keen to see an agreement with the UK but regard steel imports as an EU issue. The European Union is pressing ahead with its retaliation to the US trade tariffs: The EU is opening a case at the World Trade Organisation, after the US imposition of a 25% duty on European steel and a 10% duty on European aluminium came into force this morning. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the EU trade commissioner, is also expected to announce retaliatory tariffs on classic American products, such as Levi\u2019s jeans, bourbon whiskey, cranberries and peanut butter, at a press conference later on Friday. \u201cThe European Union will today proceed with the WTO dispute settlement case adding those additional duties on a number of imports from the United States,\u201d Federica Mogherini, the EU high representative on foreign policy, told journalists this morning. \u201cThe European Union measures will be reasonable, proportionate and in full compliance with WTO rules and obligations.\u201d She was the latest European politician to hit back at the US decision, which has was described by President Emmanuel Macron of France as a \u201cmistake\u201d and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, as \u201cpatently absurd\u201d. Speaking on Friday morning, Germany\u2019s economy minister Peter Altmaier said he hoped that a decisive response from the EU would prompt the US president to think again. \u201cWe hope that the European response will result in a process of reflection in the USA,\u201d Altmaier told German broadcaster ARD, adding that the EU may look to work with Mexico and Canada on trade, also hit by the new tariffs. Bernd Lange, the German socialist MEP who chairs the European parliament\u2019s international trade committee, said the tariffs were \u201cillegal\u201d and insisted the EU would \u201cmake some countermeasures, no doubt about\u201d. He said: \u201cWe chose also some symbolic products like Harley-Davidson to make clear here is a red card.\u201d Here is the full story: Markets so far continue to be fairly relaxed about the prospect of a global trade war, and the ousting of Mariano Rajoy as Spanish prime minister. The resolution of the turmoil in Italian politics certainly seems to be helping sentiment, with Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB now up 2.5%. Elsewhere Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 1.77% following the vote against Rajoy, Germany\u2019s Dax has risen 0.9% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.24%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is 0.65% better. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open nearly 120 points higher. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda said: The imposition of steel and aluminium tariffs by the US on Europe, Canada and Mexico has drawn plenty of criticism from officials but maybe in a sign of how markets can become less sensitive to certain issues, the response has so far been fairly muted. Focus will now be on the retaliatory measures that these countries have lined up and whether that in turn triggers a larger and quite unnecessary trade war. Investors currently appear at ease with the situation but that could quickly change. And a handy guide to the potential global trade war from ING Bank: Here\u2019s a US Federal Reserve member on the trade tariffs: The voting in Spain by the way showed 180 in favour of ousting prime minister Rajoy, 169 against, and one abstention. The Spanish vote has had less impact than the turmoil in Italy, says Seema Shah, global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors: Much of the market panic around Italy was about the threat to its membership of the Euro area but, by contrast, all of the main Spanish political parties are supportive of the single currency. Presuming Sanchez does not try to hang on to power, Spain is likely to see new elections later this year and a market-friendly, pro-European government should materialise from there. In the meantime, given that the support of Basque nationalist MPs required a promise to not change the budget, Sanchez is unlikely to make sweeping changes to the budget. Material economic progress has been made in recent years - Spain\u2019s fiscal position has improved; unemployment has fallen; and the banking system has been strengthened - the latest political disruption does not upset the generally positive outlook for the Spanish economy. Of course, political uncertainty is never welcome, but it has been telling that Spanish bond yields have fallen again today. It seems that Italian politics are more important for Spanish markets than Spanish politics. Here is Sanchez receiving the applause after becoming prime minister elect: The confidence vote is underway in Spain and here\u2019s a link: Here\u2019s a quick summary of some of the day\u2019s PMIs: Back with UK manufacturing, and despite the unconvincing outlook, ING Bank economist James Smith believes the Bank of England is still inclined to raise interest rates this summer: At 54.4, the latest UK manufacturing PMI is a little better than hoped but is still a far cry from the levels seen towards the end of last year. Whilst Markit/CIPS noted the weakness partly reflected a slower pace of domestic orders, we also wonder whether the steadier global growth over the past few months is starting to weigh. We suspect it is too early to see any tariff impact in these figures, but the slowdown in the Eurozone that we saw through the first quarter may be playing a role. The gradual strengthening in the trade-weighted pound since last summer could also be beginning to hit demand at the margin. Of course, the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector only makes up around 10% of the economy, so we suspect the Bank of England will be paying closer attention to next week\u2019s services index as it tries to gauge whether growth is rebounding after the weaker first quarter. After a couple of months of dismal weather, May finally saw the sun come out and this should have given the struggling high street a much needed boost. That said...we think consumer-facing sectors are not out of the woods just yet. Households remain cautious in the face of rising petrol prices, stagnant real wages, as well as economic uncertainty more generally. For that reason, a rate hike over the summer is still far from guaranteed. However our feeling from recent Bank of England commentary is that the committee has a preference to hike rates sooner rather than later if the data allows, in part to combat the risk of rising wage growth and underlying inflation. Earlier we also had the German manufacturing PMI: The Spanish confidence vote is due in around 15 minutes (10am BST), and it seems Mariano Rajoy is resigned to leaving, with socialist Pedro Sanchez set to take over as prime minister. British factory growth was stronger than expected in May, according to a survey of the sector, but the increase masks its underlying weakness. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI came in at 54.4, up from 53.9 in April and above expectations of a figure of 53.5. Markit director Rob Dobson said: At first glance the mild acceleration in the rate of output growth and rise in the headline PMI would appear positive. However scratch beneath the surface and the rebound in PMI from April\u2019s 17 month low is far from convincing. Raw material prices rose more sharply in May, but manufacturers were less able to pass on these increases and also faces supply issues. Dobson said: These price and supply headwinds, combined with a further slowdown in new order growth, could jeopardise any further expansion of the manufacturing sector. The International Monetary Fund has called for countries to work together on trade. In response to the US tariff moves, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said: Everybody loses in a protracted trade war, we encourage countries to work constructively together to reduce trade barriers and to resolve trade disagreements without resort to exceptional measures. It is unfortunate that trade tensions are rising at a moment where the global recovery is being supported by trade. For the first time in a long time, trade is growing faster than global GDP, and spreading recovery around the world. Because of trade and innovation, billions of people today enjoy longer, healthier, and more prosperous lives. Earlier IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, tweeted from the G7 Symposium in Canada: Markets seem to be unmoved, not only by the US tariffs, but also the political uncertainty in Spain. UBS analyst Bosco Ojeda explains: In a quick succession of events the Spanish parliament will vote this Friday June 1st a vote of no confidence which could remove from power president Mr. Rajoy (Partido Popular) and appoint Mr. Sanchez (PSOE)... Mr. Sanchez (PSOE) has indicated that he aims to call for early elections but the exact timing is uncertain. Current polls show weak support for PSOE, while there is increasing support for [rival] Ciudadanos. So incentives to call elections are unclear and may extend towards the 2020 limit. Mr. Sanchez has reiterated a commitment with European orthodoxy and budget control in Spain. His plan includes the acceptance on the current 2018 budget. Going forward it may be more expansive on spending but there is not much room. Attempts to reverse reforms may not find a majority in parliament.A complete u-turn in policy seems unlikely. Assuming, for the time being, a high degree of policy continuity, we do not anticipate a substantial impact on the pace of growth. Usually elections have a mild impact on GDP with delays in confidence and investments. Spain\u2019s GDP growth at 3% YTD is solid but may slow moderately over the coming quarters, with full year growth of 2.8% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. According to polls the 3 largest parties (PP, Ciudadanos and PSOE) have c70% of vote intentions and support pro-European orthodox policies which in our view are unlikely to drive a u-turn in economic policy. Far left party Podemos according to polls does not have enough support to lead the economic policies. Overall, Spanish equities and bonds have lately suffered and discount a high level of uncertainty. Only contagion from Italy would represent a real risk to risk premium levels, in our view. Latest correction on equities offer opportunities, particularly on banks and largecaps. Italy\u2019s economy, the eurozone\u2019s third biggest, grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, in line with initial estimates. The annual increase was 1.4%. Fourth quarter growth was revised up quarter on quarter to 0.4% from 0.3%. Meanwhile the country\u2019s manufacturing PMI came in below expectations: The GDP figure and the PMI survey both came before the latest Italian political turmoil, of course. Eurozone factory growth was subdued in May, falling to a 15 month low, and the weakness looks set to continue. The IHS Markit final manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 55.5, in line with an initial estimate but below the April figure of 56.2. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit, said: Some of the weakness may have been related to a higher than usual number of holidays during the month, but risks appear tilted towards growth remaining subdued or even cooling further in the coming months. There are signs the soft patch has further to run. Despite the production trend slowing markedly in recent months, the order book slowdown has been even sharper. Although growth is slowing, it may still be strong enough for the European Central Bank to press on with its plans to reduce its economic stimulus programme, due to finish by the end of 2018. Away from trade for a moment, and here is a handy round-up of predictions for the non-farm payroll numbers later: We expect to hear more details of the EU\u2019s response to the US tariffs at lunchtime (1pm BST) when the bloc\u2019s trade commissioner gives a press conference. With European markets moving higher, taking their cue from Italy not tariffs, Wall Street is also expected to open in positive territory, with IG indicated a 90 point or so rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Setting aside the trade war tensions between the US and EU, for now anyway, the European indices got off to a strong start on Friday as the Italian political crisis appeared to come to an end. Though not exactly the ideal government in the eyes of the markets, with a combination of ministers from the anti-establishment Five State Movement and the right-wing League, the formation of any Italian government is something to celebrate given how pronounced fears were that the situation would result in a Eurosceptic snap election... The euro wasn\u2019t quite as enthused, its joy tempered by the brewing transatlantic trade issues, the nature of the Italian government and the fact today could see Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy receive a vote of no confidence. This meant the single currency only managed a 0.1% rise against both the dollar and the euro, crossing $1.17 against the former and \u00a30.88 against the latter. Legal proceedings against the US measures are due to be triggered at the World Trade Organisation today. The EU wants the US actions declared illegal, but under WTO rules it will have to wait until mid-June to implement any balancing - i.e. retaliatory - measures. The US tariffs, of course, came into effect at midnight on Thursday. A new reaction from China to the US tariffs, courtesy Reuters: China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about United States\u2019 decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum exports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the comments at a regular briefing in Beijing. On Tuesday the White House imposed 25% tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods with \u201cindustrially significant technology.\u201d The threat of a trade war does not seem to have spooked European investors too much, so far at least. The FTSE 100 has climbed 0.6%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up a similar amount. News of the new government in Italy has helped the FTSE MIB gain 2.14% while Spain\u2019s Ibex has added 1% despite the prospect of prime minister Rajoy being ousted. The EU, Canada and Mexico have said they will take the trade dispute to the World Trade Organisation. Europe has a list of products which will be subject to retaliatory measures, including peanut butter, Levi\u2019s jeans, Harley-Davidson motor bikes and bourbon whiskey. Canada plans tariffs on \u00a39.6bn worth of goods, from steel to orange juice. Mexico plans to target a range of products including lamps, sausages, cranberries and cheese. Former White House Press Secretary Anthony Scaramucci said there was still room for negotiation. He said President Trump\u2019s action was a measure to correct the uneven and unbalanced trade system. He told Radio 4: If you need to put up protective tariffs to protect your farming industry or parts of your industrial base, the United States is just basically saying \u2018okay that\u2019s not fair to us because we\u2019re accepting your goods and services into our country\u2019. You\u2019ve got to give us an opportunity to compete in your country. I am sure that there are chips on both sides that can get traded to make the problem go away. There\u2019s always room in a negotiation with him, but he\u2019s also the type of person that will walk from a negotiation. Back with the US move on steel and aluminium, and Gareth Stace, from trade body UK Steel, told BBC Radio Five Live that the US tariffs were \u201cillegal and protectionist.\u201d He added: This unilateral decision beggars belief. It is the last thing we need given that we are coming out of the worst steel crisis in a generation. He said the claims that the tariffs were being imposed for national security reasons was a smokescreen, given only 3% of steel in the US is used for defence products. And he warned that UK manufacturers exporting to the US not only faced a direct hit, but also there would be a glut of steel which would otherwise have gone to the US flooding the European market. He said: Twenty to twenty five million tonnes could flood our market. Deutsche Bank, which on Thursday reportedly saw its US business put on a Federal list of problem banks, has now had its credit rating cut by S&amp;P. The agency said: S&amp;P Global Ratings today lowered its long-term issuer credit ratings on Deutsche Bank AG and its core subsidiaries to \u2018BBB+\u2019 from \u2018A-\u2019. The outlook is stable. We removed the ratings from CreditWatch negative. .. The lowering of our long-term issuer credit rating reflects that Deutsche Bank\u2019s updated strategy envisages a deeper restructuring of the business model than we previously expected, with associated non-negligible execution risks. While we consider management is taking tough, although likely inevitable, actions and proposes a logical strategy to successfully restore the bank to more solid, sustainable profitability over the medium to long term, the bank appears set for a period of sustained underperformance compared with peers, many of whom have now finished restructuring. Over the coming 18 months, we will look in particular for robust delivery against 2019 objectives, such as the \u20ac22 billion cost target, and evidence that the bank retains the solid support of its clients, something that would help underpin the revenue base in the CIB division amid a period of downsizing. While we regard capital markets earnings as inherently more volatile than retail and commercial banking, we consider a well-balanced blend of profitable businesses to be supportive of the bank\u2019s creditworthiness. Therefore the bank\u2019s ability to preserve its global capital markets franchise, focused in particular on Europe, underpins our stable outlook. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Normally on a day like today, markets would be focused on the US jobs figures due later and the manufacturing surveys which will give the first snapshots of how the global economy performed last month. But there are a few other distractions for investors to worry about, notably the prospect of a global trade war now that the US has confirmed it will slap steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico. Traders are now waiting to see how the move, and the threatened retaliation will play out. Here is our latest story on the US action: Wall Street fell by 1% and European markets ended lower but the general reaction was more restrained than might have been expected (Germany\u2019s Dax was one of the biggest losers but that has as much to do with fears about Deutsche Bank\u2019s financial health as anything else.} Asian market seem to have taken the news in their stride, given that the move was widely expected. The Nikkei 225 is down just 0.14% and the indications are that European markets will open mostly higher: Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The expected tit for tat response from the EU, Mexico and Canada is setting the scene for a trade war, which is not conducive to global growth. However, the losses have not been as large as we would have expected just a few months ago. The market is becoming more familiar with this administrations\u2019 negotiating tactics and as a result, rather than seeing a move straight into risk off trading, we are seeing some investors take a wait and see approach. The traditional safe haven Japanese yen moved lower versus the dollar, as did gold and European bourses are pointing to a stronger start on the open. There are other things on the agenda too. Markets slumped earlier in the week on fears of a new Italian election, but those fears have now been eased with the formation of a populist government and that appears to be helping investor sentiment. Indeed, as far as Europe goes, Spain has taken over the mantle of immediate problem child. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy is facing a vote of no confidence and according to the latest reports, he may well lose. As far as the manufacturing surveys are concerned, there could be some signs of a slight rebound from April. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: After a strong year of economic activity in 2017 the manufacturing sector got off to a slightly softer start at the beginning of this year, across the board. In some of the recent April data there is evidence that this softness has evened out a little and started to stabilise. In Europe activity was able to rebound a little in part, while in the US we also saw increasing evidence of rising prices with prices paid at 7-year highs. If this trend continues in today\u2019s numbers then that should be supportive of a rebound in Q2. Expectations for Spain, Italy, France and Germany manufacturing are for 54, 53, 55.1 and 56.8. In the UK we also saw a decent rebound after a soft March number, which may well have been weather related. Activity in May is expected to have steadied at around 53.5, a slight decline from the modest rebound seen in the April numbers with particular attention likely to be on cost price inflation which still looks fairly robust. Finally the non-farm payrolls, where around 190,000 jobs are expected to have been created in May after a weak 164,000 figure in April. Wages are forecast to grow by around 2.8%, up from 2.6%. Even if the numbers are disappointing, analysts believe this will not stop the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates in June.

Economist James Smith says the jobs data means a June rate hike is still on the cards. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rising employment and an above-consensus wage growth figure will reinforce expectations for a rate rise in a couple of weeks, although Fed voters will also have a firm eye on the latest trade developments.</p> <p>President Trump said shortly before today\u2019s US jobs report that he was \u201clooking forward\u201d to seeing the numbers. And with the economy having added 223k jobs in May, he is likely to be fairly chuffed.</p> <p>The unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, a new post-crisis low, and in fact came within spitting distance of 3.7% once rounding is taken into consideration. This decline came as almost 300,000 job hunters found employment in May according to the household survey.</p> <p>But for the Fed, the key positive in this month\u2019s report is that wage growth beat estimates, taking the year-on-year rate back up to 2.7%. This comes as firms appear to be finding it harder to fill positions. The proportion of small businesses finding it hard to fill job openings continues to flirt with all-time highs, while it\u2019s taking around twice as long to fill vacancies than it did during depths of the financial crisis. We think wage growth could test 3% again this year as these skill shortages gradually filter through to the official numbers.</p> <p>All of this means that a rate hike is still highly likely from the Fed in a couple of weeks\u2019 time. Our base case is that the committee will hike a further two times after that in 2018, although of course there\u2019s no doubt that Fed officials will be keeping a firm eye on the brewing global trade war, and this is the main risk to our view.</p> <p>As far as the jobs numbers are concerned, we suspect it is probably too early to see the effect of Trump\u2019s metal tariffs in this month\u2019s data, but things could start to look a little more concerning over coming months.</p> <p>There are reportedly only around 300,000 workers directly employed in both the steel and aluminium production industries. By comparison, some estimates have put the number of jobs in companies reliant on steel/aluminium inputs at around 6.5 million \u2013 in industries covering aircraft to beer cans.

We suspect it is too early to see any tariff impact in these figures, but the slowdown in the Eurozone that we saw through the first quarter may be playing a role. The gradual strengthening in the trade-weighted pound since last summer could also be beginning to hit demand at the margin.</p> <p>Of course, the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector only makes up around 10% of the economy, so we suspect the Bank of England will be paying closer attention to next week\u2019s services index as it tries to gauge whether growth is rebounding after the weaker first quarter.</p> <p>After a couple of months of dismal weather, May finally saw the sun come out and this should have given the struggling high street a much needed boost. That said...we think consumer-facing sectors are not out of the woods just yet. Households remain cautious in the face of rising petrol prices, stagnant real wages, as well as economic uncertainty more generally.</p> <p>For that reason, a rate hike over the summer is still far from guaranteed. However our feeling from recent Bank of England commentary is that the committee has a preference to hike rates sooner rather than later if the data allows, in part to combat the risk of rising wage growth and underlying inflation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b110a1ee4b0033069061fe2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T08:56:14.464Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier we also had the German manufacturing PMI:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarkitEconomics/status/1002472619202043904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Germany?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Germany</a> Manufacturing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PMI</a> hits 15-month low in May.

UBS analyst Bosco Ojeda explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a quick succession of events the Spanish parliament will vote this Friday June 1st a vote of no confidence which could remove from power president Mr. Rajoy (Partido Popular) and appoint Mr. Sanchez (PSOE)...</p> <p>Mr. Sanchez (PSOE) has indicated that he aims to call for early elections but the exact timing is uncertain. Current polls show weak support for PSOE, while there is increasing support for [rival] Ciudadanos. So incentives to call elections are unclear and may extend towards the 2020 limit. Mr. Sanchez has reiterated a commitment with European orthodoxy and budget control in Spain. His plan includes the acceptance on the current 2018 budget. Going forward it may be more expansive on spending but there is not much room. Attempts to reverse reforms may not find a majority in parliament.A complete u-turn in policy seems unlikely.</p> <p>Assuming, for the time being, a high degree of policy continuity, we do not anticipate a substantial impact on the pace of growth. Usually elections have a mild impact on GDP with delays in confidence and investments. Spain\u2019s GDP growth at 3% YTD is solid but may slow moderately over the coming quarters, with full year growth of 2.8% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. According to polls the 3 largest parties (PP, Ciudadanos and PSOE) have c70% of vote intentions and support pro-European orthodox policies which in our view are unlikely to drive a u-turn in economic policy. Far left party Podemos according to polls does not have enough support to lead the economic policies. Overall, Spanish equities and bonds have lately suffered and discount a high level of uncertainty. Only contagion from Italy would represent a real risk to risk premium levels, in our view. Latest correction on equities offer opportunities, particularly on banks and largecaps.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"148fac528bc31ce03917faab8939226432d3b4be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/148fac528bc31ce03917faab8939226432d3b4be/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayoress of Barcelona, Ada Colau, on the second day of the no-confidence motion debate against Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy at the Lower House in the Spanish Parliament in Madrid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mayoress of Barcelona, Ada Colau, on the second day of the no-confidence motion debate against Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy at the Lower House in the Spanish Parliament in Madrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EMILIO NARANJO POOL / POOL/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b10ff38e4b0033069061f99\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T08:12:47.171Z\">9.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Italy\u2019s economy, the eurozone\u2019s third biggest, grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, in line with initial estimates.</p> <p>The annual increase was 1.4%.

While we regard capital markets earnings as inherently more volatile than retail and commercial banking, we consider a well-balanced blend of profitable businesses to be supportive of the bank\u2019s creditworthiness.

However, the losses have not been as large as we would have expected just a few months ago. The market is becoming more familiar with this administrations\u2019 negotiating tactics and as a result, rather than seeing a move straight into risk off trading, we are seeing some investors take a wait and see approach. The traditional safe haven Japanese yen moved lower versus the dollar, as did gold and European bourses are pointing to a stronger start on the open.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are other things on the agenda too.</p> <p>Markets slumped earlier in the week on fears of a new Italian election, but those fears have now been eased with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/31/italys-populist-leaders-strike-deal-resurrect-coalition\">the formation of a populist government</a> and that appears to be helping investor sentiment.</p> <p>Indeed, as far as Europe goes, Spain has taken over the mantle of immediate problem child. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy is facing a vote of no confidence and according to the latest reports, he may well lose.</p> <p>As far as the manufacturing surveys are concerned, there could be some signs of a slight rebound from April. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a strong year of economic activity in 2017 the manufacturing sector got off to a slightly softer start at the beginning of this year, across the board. In some of the recent April data there is evidence that this softness has evened out a little and started to stabilise. In Europe activity was able to rebound a little in part, while in the US we also saw increasing evidence of rising prices with prices paid at 7-year highs. If this trend continues in today\u2019s numbers then that should be supportive of a rebound in Q2. Expectations for Spain, Italy, France and Germany manufacturing are for 54, 53, 55.1 and 56.8. </p> <p>In the UK we also saw a decent rebound after a soft March number, which may well have been weather related. Activity in May is expected to have steadied at around 53.5, a slight decline from the modest rebound seen in the April numbers with particular attention likely to be on cost price inflation which still looks fairly robust.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally the non-farm payrolls, where around 190,000 jobs are expected to have been created in May after a weak 164,000 figure in April. Wages are forecast to grow by around 2.8%, up from 2.6%.</p> <p>Even if the numbers are disappointing, analysts believe this will not stop the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates in June.</p> <p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p> <p>9.00 BST Eurozone Markit manufacturing PMI</p> <p>9.00 BST Italian GDP</p> <p>9.30 BST UK Markit manufacturing PMI</p> <p>13.30 BST US non-farm payrolls</p> <p>14.45 BST US Markit manufacting PMI</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-06-01T09:06:41.810Z\">at 10.06am BST</time></p>  </div>",

The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced at 8.30am that the US had added 223,000 new jobs in May as the unemployment rate slid t0 3.8%, its lowest level since April 2000 and one of the lowest levels since after the second world war. Trump, who has taken credit for job market growth despite the fact that it began under Obama, said on Twitter he was looking forward to the release of the monthly jobs report just over an hour ahead of its release. Following his tweet, treasury yields moved sharply higher. The monthly report is one of the most market sensitive pieces of economic information released by the government and is carefully guarded ahead of its release. For anyone other than the president, the comment would likely lead to an investigation or likely firing. The report is given to senior White House officials the day before its release but is usually closely protected. Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, said Trump should never again be given sight of the figures before their release. \u201cYou should have gotten the employment numbers from the Council of Economic Advisers yesterday. And if this tweet is conveying inside information about a particularly good jobs number you should never get them in advance from the Council of Economic Advisers again,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. The latest gains were in retail trade, healthcare and construction, and wage growth \u2013 which has been slow since the end of the recession \u2013 picked up modestly. From a year ago, wages were up 2.7% \u2013 better than the 2.6% growth economists had forecast. So far this year the US has now added 207,000 new jobs a month, continuing a record nine-year streak of job creation. The strong numbers come as some economists worry that a threatened trade war could damage the US economy and as investors fret that the news will further pressure the Federal Reserve to speed up the rate at which it increases interest rates. But the report highlighted once again that many Americans remain on the sidelines despite the tightening labor market. The labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of workers in jobs or looking for work, edged down to 62.7% from 62.8% in April \u2013 levels last seen in the 1970s. That fall in participation was partly responsible for the latest dip in the unemployment rate, said the Economic Policy institute. \u201cAbout two-thirds of the drop in the unemployment rate in May was because workers found jobs, while about one-third of the drop was from people leaving the labor force,\u201d wrote EPi economist Elise Gould in a blog post.",

Four activists descended by ropes from the ceiling above the stage, as the Total chief executive, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, began his presentation, with at least 20 more gaining access to the Palais des Congr\u00e8s. Some of the activists chained themselves to fixtures in the hall with the proceedings disrupted by chants and the blowing of whistles. The remainder of the 250-strong group protested outside the venue. Edina Ifticene, who was invited by Pouyann\u00e9 to address the annual meeting to explain the protest, said direct action had been planned after Total ignored the activists last year. \u201cWe have been campaigning for more than a year and a half,\u201d she said, speaking to the Guardian. \u201cLast year at the annual meeting we had a share [of stock] and so asked questions of the company and provided a lot of evidence and arguments. They said everything is fine and there is no ecological risk. This year we decided to take direct action, we want Total to listen to us.\u201d Total wants to explore Brazil\u2019s Foz do Amazonas basin, which geologists estimate could contain up to 14bn barrels of oil, or more than the entire proven reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. Brazil\u2019s environmental agency rejected the company\u2019s bid for a licence for the fourth time on Tuesday, requesting more information. A Greenpeace expedition in April documented coral in the area where Total plans to drill, after an earlier discovery of a massive coral reef nearby. Greenpeace also opposes Total\u2019s investment in offshore oil production in French Guiana, which will boost its presence in the potentially lucrative area. Total faces more protests this month, after France\u2019s largest farmers\u2019 union called for a blockade of refineries in protest at the company\u2019s decision to use imported palm oil at a new biofuel production site.",

Pre-tax profits fell from \u00a3791.7m in 2016 \u2013 which was its worst performance since it was taken over by the American grocer Walmart in 1999 \u2013 to \u00a3712.6m last year.

After stripping out Easter, Asda reported like-for-like sales up 1% in the three months to 31 March. In April, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda spelled out the details of the deal that could create a new force in supermarket retailing that is bigger than market leader Tesco. Sainsbury\u2019s will pay Walmart nearly \u00a33bn in cash and hand it a 42% stake in the combined business if the tie-up is approved by the competition watchdog. Sainsbury\u2019s has promised to retain both brand names and insisted there were no plans for store closures as a result of creating the group comprising 2,800 outlets and sales of \u00a351bn.",

The Competition and Markets Authority is to look at issues including the rate at which funeral directors have raised prices in recent years. It will also look at whether the information provided by funeral directors on prices and services is too confusing for people to be able to choose the best option for them. \u201cProfit margins in the \u2018at-need\u2019 funeral market have been inflated for years,\u201d says James Daley, managing director at consumer group Fairer Finance. \u201cCustomers who buy funerals are grieving and have no idea what a fair price for a funeral is. And sadly they have proved far too easy to take advantage of. This market needs tighter regulation and better protections for consumers. \u201cEveryone will need a funeral eventually, and it\u2019s important that we can be confident we are paying a fair price for a good quality service.\u201d The average cost of a funeral is estimated to be nearly \u00a33,800, not including discretionary extra costs that can add \u00a32,000 to a bill. This is more than double the price when insurer SunLife first started tracking prices in 2004 in its Cost of Dying annual report. The rising level of cremation fees will also be a key focus of the CMA\u2019s investigation, as cremations now account for about 75% of all funerals. Separately, the Treasury has announced that it is launching an investigation into the pre-paid funeral sector \u2013 around 1.3 million people in the UK have a pre-paid plan \u2013 responding to bad practice in the industry. \u201cPeople can understandably be very emotionally vulnerable when planning a funeral,\u201d said Daniel Gordon, senior director of markets at the CMA. \u201cWe therefore think it is important that, at what can be a particularly challenging time, the process is made as easy as possible.\u201d News of the two investigations sent shares in Dignity, one of the UK\u2019s biggest funeral providers, tumbling almost 11%. In January, Dignity said it would consider disclosing its prices online and introducing a single national tariff for basic services amid mounting competition and criticism of its business model. The FTSE 350 company, which in January issued a profits warning, has seen its share price fall by over 50% in the last year. The company was forced to cut the price of its cheapest funeral package by 25%, after larger rival Co-op started cutting its prices in 2016. In January, Dignity said that initial reported deaths for 2017 were 590,000 in Britain, and the group conducted 68,800 funerals, compared with 70,700 the previous year. It noted that the Office for National Statistics predicted approximately 580,000 deaths in 2018. Last year, Dignity sponsored a report from Fairer Finance that uncovered an array of problems in the pre-paid funeral sector, both in terms of conduct and consumer protection. The Commons work and pensions committee also passed evidence from a report last year into funeral benefits to the CMA.",

      "bodyText": "Outsourcing specialists Capita and FDM Group are facing potential legal action from former employees who were faced with demands for thousands of pounds in fees when they tried to leave. Both companies insist graduates and other job hunters carry out three or four months of training, for which they are not paid, before they are put forward for work with top companies. Trainees must then agree to work for two years or be liable for up to \u00a320,000 in fees for the training courses, as first revealed by the Guardian last year. The campaigning barrister Jolyon Maugham QC, founder of the Good Law Project , who is backing legal battles over the legal affairs of Vote Leave and Uber\u2019s tax bill, is to launch a high court action in a bid to have such practices outlawed. The team, which includes Sean Jones QC, who is also acting for Hermes delivery drivers and Tesco shop workers on employment rights cases, is attempting to raise \u00a350,000 via the crowdfunding site CrowdJustice to support the case. Maugham said he believed charging such high fees acted as an \u201cunlawful restraint of trade\u201d as they did not legitimately reflect the cost of the training the companies had provided workers. He said all the contracts signed by those involved in the case levied the same obligation to pay right up until the last day of their two-year commitment. \u201cWe say this type of clause looks more like indentured labour than a reasonable balance between the interests of young graduates and these enormous professional services organisations,\u201d Maugham said. He said young people were finding themselves trapped in jobs because of the fear of having to pay fees, causing problems when they needed to move on for family, health or professional reasons. Capita, which provides services ranging from electronic tagging of offenders to store card services for retailers and BBC licence fee collection, demands up to \u00a313,000 from graduates who try to leave before completing their training and two years of work. Until last year it demanded up to \u00a321,000 from trainees, who do not receive any pay while attending courses that last a few months. The case includes one former Capita trainee, who faced a demand for \u00a318,500 when she left just over a year after completing her training after she made clear she could not take work outside Greater London. The company witheld her final month\u2019s salary after she refused to pay up. A former employee of FDM, a FTSE 250 company that supplies technology professionals and management consultants to companies including Virgin Media, BP and the Home Office, faced a demand for \u00a318,000 after trying to leave a few months after completing his training. One former FDM trainee told the Guardian that he had done unpaid training for two months, which included some general guidance on professional skills, such as how to write emails and make presentations, and followed by some IT training. He was then sent for interviews and placed with a company. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy in the job but the problem with the contract is there is so much room for manipulation and coercion. The manager knows that you are stuck,\u201d he said. He said the kind of training received by FDM was available online for a few hundred pounds and the training costs levied by the company was \u201ca purely arbitrary fee to stop people leaving\u201d. Tanya de Grunwald, the founder of careers blog Graduate Fog, which first revealed Capita\u2019s four-month unpaid training scheme and has helped put together the case, said: \u201cThis grotesque practice needs to die now. No one should have to pay a penalty to leave a job they are unhappy in.\u201d An FDM spokesperson said: \u201cFDM Group\u2019s training programme provides an opportunity for all graduates to gain and build a successful career in IT. \u201cWe provide an average of 10 weeks of training which equips trainees with the skills and knowledge and nationally recognised qualifications that are essential for them to become an IT or business consultant, across a number of service areas. \u201cWe have a clear and unwavering commitment for all trainees and employees to be treated and compensated fairly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our employees also receive a competitive graduate salary that far exceeds national minimum wage levels.\u201d Capita said it would be responding to a letter regarding potential legal action and declined to comment further.",
