      "bodyText": "The UK economy will have to weather a short, sharp shock, with Brexit uncertainty holding back both business investment and consumer spending, according to a leading economic forecasting group. As forecasters cut growth expectations, a survey of finance chiefs showed caution increasing since the referendum, and retailers reported fewer shoppers on the high street than a year ago. Severe dents to confidence mean the post-referendum economy is on \u201ca very different path\u201d from three months ago, said the EY Item Club, a forecasting group that uses Treasury modelling. It has slashed its predictions of economic growth for the next few years. In April, Item said the UK\u2019s GDP would grow by 2.6% in 2017 \u2013 a figure it now expects to be barely 0.4%. It expects the pound to have fallen 15% in a year by the end of 2016, and decline further through the decade. Consolation for borrowers may come from marginally lower interest rates in the short term, while a severely weakened pound will help exports \u2013 although not enough to prevent a significant deterioration in the UK\u2019s prospects. Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser at Item, said: \u201cLonger-term, the UK may have to adjust to a permanent reduction in the size of the economy, compared with the trend that seemed possible prior to the vote.\u201d Steve Varley, chairman of EY UK, said the next two years would be \u201cundoubtedly challenging\u201d. He added: \u201cThe UK government will need to quickly introduce measures to help offset Brexit blues, support the economy and continue to attract foreign investment. \u201cThe focus now needs to be on making sure that the UK negotiates the right trade deals that will allow access to key markets.\u201d Unemployment is forecast to rise from 5% to 7.1% by the end of 2019, cutting household disposable income. Consumer spending is expected to fall next year \u2013 the first decline since 2011. Spencer said: \u201cWorries about jobs are likely to see shoppers hold back on big ticket purchases, such as cars and housing-related spending. At the same time, higher inflation off the back of sterling\u2019s weakness will squeeze growth in real incomes.\u201d Meanwhile, the sole member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to vote to cut interest rates last week, as the bank held the rate constant, yesterday said inflation expections beyond the next few years had fallen since the referendum from an already low base. Gertjan Vlieghe, writing in the Financial Times to outline why he voted for an immediate cut, said: \u201cIt was clear enough to me already that we would not return inflation to [the Bank\u2019s] target sustainably without further monetary policy action.\u201d As well as a rate cut, he has argued for further stimulus from the Bank. Meanwhile, a survey of 132 chief financial officers at major UK companies showed that business optimism had declined to the point where most were gloomier about their firm\u2019s prospects now than during the height of the financial crisis. According to the poll by Deloitte, more than four out of five CFOs expect to cut hiring and discretionary spending in the next year. David Sproul, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte, said: \u201cThe outcome of the EU referendum has triggered a sharp, negative response from the corporate sector.\u201d While the speedy appointment of Theresa May as prime minister had reduced uncertainty, he said a vision for the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU should be set out for further stability and reassurance. Elsewhere, retailers reported a drop in shoppers on the high street in the week after the referendum, compared with the same period last year. While footfall figures for high streets, shopping centres and retail parks have been up in the first week of June, they finished the month 2.8% lower than the same period last year. This is the deepest decline since February 2014. Poor weather may have played a part, said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. She added: \u201cJune has [also] seen many distractions, from Euro 2016 to Wimbledon, so heading out to the shops seems to have slipped down the priority list for many.\u201d Dickinson said retailers should redouble efforts in the coming months and, adding: \u201cThe EU referendum will not have changed the in-store experience for customers and, crucially, the price of goods on the shelves.\u201d Although slightly more shoppers were out in the days after the referendum than before, the last week of each month normally sees a surge in spending at a time when many people get their pay packets. Data from Barclaycard released last week showed discretionary spending in pubs and restaurants fell back from 24 June.",

      "bodyText": "The average asking price of homes coming on to the market in England and Wales has fallen since mid June, according to property website Rightmove, with the Brexit vote exaggerating the usual summer slowdown. The figures, which cover the period between 12 June and 9 July, show that new sellers asked for an average of \u00a3307,824 for their homes, a fall of 0.9%, or \u00a32,647, on the previous four weeks. Miles Shipside, Rightmove\u2019s director, said the decline was \u201cwithin the range that we have seen at this time of year since 2010\u201d. \u201cWith the onset of the summer holiday season, new sellers typically price more conservatively and the average drop in the month of July is 0.4% over the last six years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this July\u2019s fall is marginally larger, as political turbulence has a track record of unsettling sentiment,\u201d he said. The latest monthly snapshot of asking prices, based on properties newly listed on Rightmove\u2019s website, shows that there were decreases in all parts of England and Wales. The biggest drop was in Yorkshire and the Humber, where new sellers were asking for an average of \u00a3174,614 \u2013 2.1% less than the previous month. The East Midlands recorded the smallest fall, with the average asking price down by 0.2% at \u00a3197,705. In contrast with recent research by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), Rightmove reported that buyer demand was not out of line with previous summer periods. \u201cIn the last two weeks post-referendum, compared to 2015, inquiries to agents from buyers are down by 16%,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, last year\u2019s figures were boosted by pent-up demand after the surprise general election result\u201d. Buyer inquiries were consistent with the same period in 2014, \u201cwhich is a more comparable benchmark\u201d, Rightmove said. Sellers seemed undeterred by the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU, the property website said. Compared with the same period in 2015, it said, in the two weeks before the referendum, the number of new properties coming on to the market fell by 8%, before increasing by 6% in the two weeks after the vote. The continued imbalance between the number of homes available and the number of would-be buyers meant that estate agents were reporting that inquiries per property remain remarkably resilient. Mark Manning, the director of Manning Stainton estate agents in Leeds, said: \u201cThe political soap opera that has played out following the historic vote to leave the EU, combined with the obvious economic uncertainty should have, for all intents and purposes, spawned a significant alteration in the market. \u201cUp north, all seems to be well, with new listings in June showing a 7% increase on 2015 and a volume of sales which remained broadly similar to those in previous months.\u201d Ahead of the referendum, the Treasury had warned of a fall in house prices if the leave campaign won. In the weeks since, estate agents have reported some sales falling through, and some buyers seeking to renegotiate prices down. The latest Rics report showed they were more pessimistic about the short-term outlook for the market than at any point since the late 1990s. On Thursday, the Bank of England said its forecasts for prices had been adjusted downwards since the vote. The bank also announced that it would not cut the base rate, but falling returns from government bonds have already led to price cuts on fixed-rate mortgages. Recently, Coventry building society launched the lowest 10-year deal, at 2.39%, and other lenders have been reducing five and 10-year rates. Brian Murphy, the head of lending at the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said it was too early to tell what the mid to long-term impact of the Brexit vote would be on the housing market. \u201cBut with many lenders repricing downwards, particularly on longer-term fixed rate products, buyers continue to be able to take advantage of historically low mortgage rates, which coupled with what looks to be an ongoing lack of supply, may well fortify the market in the months to come,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The latest labour force figures are a mixture of \u201cHmmm that\u2019s not real flash\u201d, and \u201cOMG that is amazing\u201d. But while some of the news about the creation of full-time employment deserved being excited about, the figures highlighted that the amount of joy you feel about the economy is very much dependent upon where you live. In June the unemployment rate rose to 5.8% in seasonally adjusted terms, and stayed steady at 5.7% in trend terms. The big news, however, was that the employment growth in seasonally adjusted terms was all in full-time employment \u2013 increasing by 38,400 while part-time employment fell by 30,600. This was very good news given my golden rule for employment figures is that full-time employment growth reveals the true strength of the economy. But given my second rule of employment figures is to trust the trend and treat the seasonally adjusted figures with suspicion, the news was less great. I\u2019m not sure why anyone would get too carried away with the monthly change in full-time employment in seasonally adjusted terms. About the only reason to follow it closely is if you had just chosen to give up caffeine and you needed a new stimulant. A quick look at the change in full-time employment in both seasonally adjusted and trend shows how analysis of the seasonally adjusted figures pretty much involves coming up with synonyms for \u201cerratic\u201d: Up 18,600; down 43,900; up 11,000; down 7,700; down 19,300; up 2,500; up 38,400. The past seven months has seen an average move of 20,100 positions each month (either up or down) and ends up with a whole 400 fewer people in full-time employment than there was in November last year. Trust the trend, and keep your heart palpitations to a minimum. In trend terms, 705 full-time employment position were added in June \u2013 which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot (it isn\u2019t \u2013 a mere 0.01% increase) but it was the first increase in full-time employment in trend terms since January: But June also saw a decline in the amount of hours worked \u2013 never a good sign. If we\u2019re going to try to at least pretend the glass could be half-full if we squint our eyes, then we can note that the decline in the amount of hours worker looks to have slowed. And if that is the case, it is a very good thing because the level of hours worked is perhaps a better indicator of economic health than is employment growth. The past six months has seen a very strong slowing in the growth of hours worked. For now employment growth has held up OK, but unless the level of hours worked starts picking up sooner or later actual employment is going to fall: The interesting thing about full-time employment is where it is coming from. Right now, if you are after full-time work, head to Victoria. Not only is Victoria beating the rest of the nation for full-time employment creation, it is beating its own history. In the past 12 months, an all-time record 87,800 full-time positions were created in the state: And while, because of population growth, that doesn\u2019t make it the biggest annual increase in percentage terms, the annual growth rate of 4.5% is the biggest since June 1989, so we\u2019re talking some pretty amazing job creation. And the growth is for both men and women \u2013 42,800 extra full-time jobs for men, and 45,000 for women. The 6.6% growth of full-time employment for women is the best for 20 years: So strong was the full-time employment growth in Victoria in the past year, it was actually more than for the entire nation \u2013 as full-time employment fell by 20,000 in the rest of the country. Such a phenomena is not unknown, but it is unusual \u2013 especially given the relative weakness in the rest of the county: It means even when looking at the trend figures it is hard not to be a bit sceptical of the figures. When labour force figures break records, it\u2019s a little like seeing an athletic world record being set \u2013 you think that it is wonderful and then you hope you can trust the result. The big disparity between jobs creation is a factor of the continued decline in full-time work in the mining states of Western Australia and Queensland, and New South Wales coming off the boil. While things are sunny in Victoria, Western Australia saw the fourth biggest fall of full-time employment in the past year \u2013 only during the global financial crisis have more full-time jobs been lost than the 34,957 lost in the 12 months to June: Thus even if the result is a true reflection of the state of affairs in Victoria, it highlights the very uneven nature of the economy \u2013 not so much two-speed as a patchwork where some states are brighter than others, and some states, like NSW, which have been bright now seem to be losing some sheen.",

About the only reason to follow it closely is if you had just chosen to give up caffeine and you needed a new stimulant.</p> <p>A quick look at the change in full-time employment in both seasonally adjusted and trend shows how analysis of the seasonally adjusted figures pretty much involves coming up with synonyms for \u201cerratic\u201d:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly growth of full-time employment\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BIA8Q/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Up 18,600; down 43,900; up 11,000; down 7,700; down 19,300; up 2,500; up 38,400.</p> <p>The past seven months has seen an average move of 20,100 positions each month (either up or down) and ends up with a whole 400 fewer people in full-time employment than there was in November last year.</p> <p>Trust the trend, and keep your heart palpitations to a minimum.</p> <p>In trend terms, 705 full-time employment position were added in June \u2013 which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot (it isn\u2019t \u2013 a mere 0.01% increase) but it was the first increase in full-time employment in trend terms since January:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly employment growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r3EcZ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But June also saw a decline in the amount of hours worked \u2013 never a good sign.

    "webTitle": "Ross McEwan on Brexit: it's not a banking crisis \u2013 RBS has plenty of money", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A little after 4.30am Ross McEwan picked up the phone to speak to his colleagues at Royal Bank of Scotland. The chief executive of the bailed-out bank had just learned that the UK had voted for Brexit. Up early to catch a flight to Edinburgh, McEwan wanted to ensure the contingency plans that had been drawn up several months earlier were being rolled out. Staff had been up early to deal with customer orders \u2013 the dealing room handled five times the usual amount of volume of foreign exchange \u2013 and the bank was watching for any signs of panic in the financial sector. While the share price did sink to levels reminiscent of the 2008 crisis, when the bank ran out of cash and survived only because of a \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, McEwan said the immediate impact in the first few days after the Brexit vote was different. \u201cWe had deposits coming to us because people realised we were a strong bank,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a banking crisis ... We\u2019ve got plenty of liquidity. We\u2019re open for business. We\u2019ve got plenty of money to lend,\u201d said the New Zealander, who has been at the helm of the 73% taxpayer-owned bank since October 2013. The EU referendum result will have implications for all banks. Interest rates, already at historic lows of 0.5%, look likely to be cut on 4 August, making profits harder to generate for all banks. The appointment of a new chancellor, Philip Hammond, is also a key factor for banks but particularly RBS, over which he could wield huge influence. George Osborne had hoped to sell off the bulk of the RBS stake by 2020. But the RBS chief executive, speaking before the cabinet was finalised, offered a simple message: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a plan that is working because we\u2019ve restructured the business exactly as we said we would. We have a core business here that still makes quarter on quarter \u00a31bn of pre-tax profits. So it\u2019s a very solid business that we are concentrating on.\u201d The sport fanatic, who enthuses about 5.30am bike rides on Saturdays in Richmond Park in London, took what is arguably the UK\u2019s highest profile job in banking after Stephen Hester, who had lured him from Australia a year earlier to run high street operations, was forced out after a series of run-ins with politicians. Sitting in an impersonal meeting room in the bank\u2019s London base, McEwan rattled off how he had cut costs, sold off riskier assets, and accelerated the pullback to 13 countries from the 54 countries where Fred Goodwin had planted flags. Halfway through his five-year plan, McEwan has refocused the bank on the UK and Ireland, where it owns Ulster Bank. Together these markets generate 90% of revenue compared with 50% pre-crisis. But while the bank might be stronger than it was pre-2008, profits are still elusive. Losses have hit \u00a350bn in the past eight years and the prospects of a full-year profit for 2016 seem slim. The recent share price slide means hopes of a return to the private sector have evaporated. With the half-yearly bank reporting season less than a fortnight away, McEwan could not talk about current trading. But he discussed the share price slide of the major banks. RBS\u2019s was at 185p on Friday \u2013 taxpayers break even on their stake at 502p. \u201cWhat\u2019s concerning investors [is] the interest rate[s] being lower for longer, what will that do to your earnings? If there is a slowdown in the economy, what will that to do loan impairment? Will you need to get more capital longer term? Those are the sorts of issues that banks are being asked the question on,\u201d said McEwan. There are also two RBS-specific factors \u2013 \u201cweights on the bank\u201d as McEwan described them. First, a penalty, which analysts predict could be as much as $13bn (\u00a310bn), from the US authorities relating to the sale of mortgage bonds before the 2008 crisis; and secondly, the need to spin off 315 branches to meet EU rules at the time of the bailout. The Williams &amp; Glyn brand is being revived to facilitate much delayed disposal of branches, and McEwan rejected the idea that Brexit might release RBS from this obligation. \u201cI\u2019m working on the basis rules are the rules,\u201d he said. This process means the RBS name will disappear off English and Welsh high streets, where the NatWest name will become more prominent. But RBS will remain the bank\u2019s identity on the stock market and on Scottish high streets. The Coutts private bank will retain its own brand. The Brexit vote has also put a focus on pay. The prime minister, Theresa May, has put the discrepancies between executive pay and those outside the boardroom on the agenda. Worker representatives on boards have been mooted. Analysts have been asking if a feeling of inequality may have motivated the Brexit vote and McEwan acknowledged this. He noted it was not just a UK phenomenon, pointing to the political situation in parts of the EU, the US and Australia. \u201cI think there is a cry out \u2018for we\u2019ve been left behind\u2019 but it\u2019s not just in the UK,\u201d said McEwan. He questioned how employee representation would work in the financial sector where the new senior manager regime places specific responsibility on boardroom directors, although he did not dismiss the idea. McEwan has tried to avoid Hester-style pay rows by waiving annual bonuses. But his \u00a33.8m pay deal for 2015 was the highest for a chief executive of the bank since its 2008 bailout. For the next half of his plan, McEwan said he was focused on his goal of making the bank No 1 for customer service by 2020. \u201cIn another two and half years my objective will be to be making profits, having all the [regulatory inquiries] and litigation out of the way and having all our service levels at the top of the market place,\u201d he said. Like other banks, RBS missold PPI but it has also had its own crisis \u2013 the allegations that small business customers were pushed to the brink so RBS could make greater profits. McEwan could offer no insight as to when a regulatory report on the matter might be published. When he arrived at RBS, he admitted being \u201cquite surprised by how bad this industry is\u201d and set about making changes. He is ending teaser rates, 0% balance transfers on cards and two years ago started helping mortgage customers prepare for a rate rise. Even against a backdrop where rates are now falling, those fixed rates on to which customers have been moved will \u201chave stood them in very good stead\u201d, said McEwan. Symbolic changes have been made too. The bank\u2019s boardroom in London \u2013 known as the \u201cwar room\u201d in Goodwin\u2019s day \u2013 has been renamed after Andrew Berkeley Drummond, part of the family that founded Drummonds Bank, which RBS still owns. As McEwan posed for pictures in the blue-curtained room, he paused at a plaque spelling out Drummond\u2019s rules: \u201cThe first rule never to be departed from is to make the welfare of the customers the first object.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A little after 4.30am <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ross-mcewan\">Ross McEwan</a> picked up the phone to speak to his colleagues at Royal Bank of Scotland. The chief executive of the bailed-out bank had just learned that the UK had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/uk-voted-for-brexit-but-is-there-a-way-back\">voted for Brexit</a>. Up early to catch a flight to Edinburgh, McEwan wanted to ensure the contingency plans that had been drawn up several months earlier were being rolled out.</p> <p>Staff had been up early to deal with customer orders \u2013 the dealing room handled five times the usual amount of volume of foreign exchange \u2013 and the bank was watching for any signs of panic in the financial sector. While the share price did sink to levels reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">the 2008 crisis</a>, when the bank ran out of cash and survived only because of a \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, McEwan said the immediate impact in the first few days after the Brexit vote was different. \u201cWe had deposits coming to us because people realised we were a strong bank,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/blackrock-larry-fink-uk-recession-brexit\">BlackRock chief warns Brexit will lead to 'short-term' recession in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is not a banking crisis ... We\u2019ve got plenty of liquidity. We\u2019re open for business. We\u2019ve got plenty of money to lend,\u201d said the New Zealander, who has been at the helm of the 73% taxpayer-owned bank since October 2013. </p> <p>The EU referendum result will have implications for all banks. Interest rates, already at historic lows of 0.5%, look likely to be cut on 4 August, making profits harder to generate for all banks. The appointment of a new chancellor, Philip Hammond, is also a key factor for banks but particularly RBS, over which he could wield huge influence.</p> <p>George Osborne had hoped to sell off the bulk of the RBS stake by 2020. But the RBS chief executive, speaking before the cabinet was finalised, offered a simple message: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a plan that is working because we\u2019ve restructured the business exactly as we said we would. We have a core business here that still makes quarter on quarter \u00a31bn of pre-tax profits. So it\u2019s a very solid business that we are concentrating on.\u201d</p> <p>The sport fanatic, who enthuses about 5.30am bike rides on Saturdays in Richmond Park in London, took what is arguably the UK\u2019s highest profile job in banking after Stephen Hester, who had lured him from Australia a year earlier to run high street operations, was forced out after a series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/12/rbs-ceo-stephen-hester-quits\">of run-ins with politicians</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fc01f10ac726f652d55fe8ec187cf85892bf481\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fc01f10ac726f652d55fe8ec187cf85892bf481/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Hester in 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Hester in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Moir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sitting in an impersonal meeting room in the bank\u2019s London base, McEwan rattled off how he had cut costs, sold off riskier assets, and accelerated the pullback to 13 countries from the 54 countries where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sir-fred-goodwin\">Fred Goodwin</a> had planted flags. Halfway through his five-year plan, McEwan has refocused the bank on the UK and Ireland, where it owns Ulster Bank. Together these markets generate 90% of revenue compared with 50% pre-crisis.<br></p> <p>But while the bank might be stronger than it was pre-2008, profits are still elusive. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/26/rbs-chief-executive-ross-mcewan-pay-2bn-loss-results-royal-bank-of-scotland\">Losses have hit \u00a350bn in the past eight years</a> and the prospects of a full-year profit for 2016 seem slim. The recent share price slide means hopes of a return to the private sector have evaporated.</p> <p>With the half-yearly bank reporting season less than a fortnight away, McEwan could not talk about current trading. But he discussed the share price slide of the major banks. RBS\u2019s was at 185p on Friday \u2013 taxpayers break even on their stake at 502p. \u201cWhat\u2019s concerning investors [is] the interest rate[s] being lower for longer, what will that do to your earnings? If there is a slowdown in the economy, what will that to do loan impairment? Will you need to get more capital longer term? Those are the sorts of issues that banks are being asked the question on,\u201d said McEwan.</p> <p>There are also two RBS-specific factors \u2013 \u201cweights on the bank\u201d as McEwan described them. First, a penalty, which analysts predict could be as much as $13bn (\u00a310bn), from the US authorities relating to the sale of mortgage bonds before the 2008 crisis; and secondly, the need to spin off 315 branches to meet EU rules at the time of the bailout. </p> <p>The Williams &amp; Glyn brand is being revived to facilitate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/rbs-admits-delays-offloading-williams-and-glyn\">much delayed</a> disposal of branches, and McEwan rejected the idea that Brexit might release RBS from this obligation. \u201cI\u2019m working on the basis rules are the rules,\u201d he said. This process means the RBS name will disappear off English and Welsh high streets, where the NatWest name will become more prominent. But RBS will remain the bank\u2019s identity on the stock market and on Scottish high streets. The Coutts private bank will retain its own brand.</p> <p>The Brexit vote has also put a focus on pay. The prime minister, Theresa May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/theresa-mays-plans-curb-boardroom-excess-receive-mixed-reaction\">has put the discrepancies between executive pay and those outside the boardroom on the agenda</a>. Worker representatives on boards have been mooted.<br></p> <p>Analysts have been asking if a feeling of inequality may have motivated the Brexit vote and McEwan acknowledged this. He noted it was not just a UK phenomenon, pointing to the political situation in parts of the EU, the US and Australia. \u201cI think there is a cry out \u2018for we\u2019ve been left behind\u2019 but it\u2019s not just in the UK,\u201d said McEwan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2016/jul/14/bank-of-england-keeps-cool-head-amid-rate-hysteria\">Bank of England keeps cool head amid rate hysteria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He questioned how employee representation would work in the financial sector where the new senior manager regime places specific responsibility on boardroom directors, although he did not dismiss the idea. McEwan has tried to avoid Hester-style pay rows by waiving annual bonuses. But his \u00a33.8m pay deal for 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/26/rbs-chief-executive-ross-mcewan-pay-2bn-loss-results-royal-bank-of-scotland\">was the highest for a chief executive of the bank</a> since its 2008 bailout.</p> <p>For the next half of his plan, McEwan said he was focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/27/rbs-bonuses-loss-pay-market-rate\">his goal of making the bank No 1 for customer service by 2020</a>. \u201cIn another two and half years my objective will be to be making profits, having all the [regulatory inquiries] and litigation out of the way and having all our service levels at the top of the market place,\u201d he said. Like other banks, RBS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/13/mis-selling-ppi-financial-services-market-public-accounts-committee-compensation-claims\">missold PPI</a> but it has also had its own crisis \u2013 the allegations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/25/rbs-accused-business-profits-regulators\">that small business customers were pushed to the brink so RBS could make greater profits</a>. McEwan could offer no insight as to when a regulatory report on the matter might be published.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/ross-mcewan-rbs-new-chief-executive\">he arrived at RBS</a>, he admitted being \u201cquite surprised by how bad this industry is\u201d and set about making changes. He is ending teaser rates, 0% balance transfers on cards and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/16/banks-customers-mortgage-rate-rise-rbs\">two years ago started helping mortgage customers prepare for a rate rise</a>. Even against a backdrop where rates are now falling, those fixed rates on to which customers have been moved will \u201chave stood them in very good stead\u201d, said McEwan.</p> <p>Symbolic changes have been made too. The bank\u2019s boardroom in London \u2013 known as the \u201cwar room\u201d in Goodwin\u2019s day \u2013 has been renamed after Andrew Berkeley Drummond, part of the family that founded Drummonds Bank, which RBS still owns. As McEwan posed for pictures in the blue-curtained room, he paused at a plaque spelling out Drummond\u2019s rules: \u201cThe first rule never to be departed from is to make the welfare of the customers the first object.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost four weeks have passed since Britain voted to leave the EU, and those who wanted to remain in it are having trouble accepting the result. They feel bereft. They feel that they were defeated by underhand means. They feel that those who voted for Brexit were uneducated and didn\u2019t really understand what they were doing. There is a nasty undercurrent of disdain, bordering on contempt, to all this angst. Many of those on the losing side of the referendum debate appear to actively want the economy to slide into recession in order to teach the 52% a lesson. Let\u2019s be clear. The economy is fragile. It was slowing down even before the referendum date was fixed and it is ill-prepared for the shock of Brexit. The UK has a budget deficit of 4% of GDP, a balance of payments deficit of 7% of GDP and the worst recent productivity record of any G7 country bar Italy. The idea that George Osborne \u201cfixed the roof while the sun was shining\u201d is fatuous. What\u2019s more, it is easy to sketch out the reasons why things are going to be difficult. Traditionally, investment is the swing factor in any economic cycle. When businesses are upbeat about the future, they spend more on new kit, boosting national output. When they are cautious, as they are certain to be now, they mothball spending plans and GDP weakens. Consumer spending will also be hit by the squeeze on spending power caused by the higher inflation that will result from the impact of the falling pound on the cost of imports. The flipside is that exports become cheaper, which will help boost output, albeit not by much, unless global demand recovers from its current depressed level. A slowdown, therefore, seems inevitable. The extent and duration of that slowdown will depend on the actions taken by the Bank of England and the Treasury, and how long it takes the government to sketch out what a Brexit Britain is going to look like. None of this is a surprise. The notion that the economy would struggle after a leave vote was strongly argued during the referendum campaign, but did not carry the day. Hence the view that those who voted for Brexit didn\u2019t understand what was at stake. Yet the evidence suggests that many of those who voted to leave knew that there would be a short-term hit to the economy, but decided that they were willing to take the risk. They weighed up the pros and cons \u2013 as did US investment banks, the CBI and universities \u2013 but came up with a different answer. A speech given last week by Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank, helps explain why so many people were unmoved by George Osborne\u2019s argument that the UK would be voting for a DIY recession if the country opted for Brexit. On a visit to Nottingham, Haldane said he was struck by the fact that for many people, the recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008 had never ended. When he talked about economic recovery, he was stopped in his tracks by a \u201cforest of furrowed brows\u201d. The message was simple: there had been no recovery. As Haldane went on to explain, this was not a case of false consciousness. The economic facts are plain: the economy is simply not delivering for millions of people. Earnings are 7% above where they were when the recession ended in 2009, but still 5% below the peak once rising prices are taken into account. This is the longest period of flat or falling real wages since the mid 19th century. UK national wealth, measured by the value of assets such as property and pensions, has increased by an impressive sounding \u00a33tn since 2009, but the gains have been skewed towards those who owned their own homes or had sizeable pension pots. Only in two UK regions of the UK, London and the south-east, is GDP per head higher than it was before the recession. Everywhere else, it is lower \u2013 strikingly so in some parts of the country. The argument deployed by the remain side, that the only real risk to Britain\u2019s economic renaissance was a vote to leave the EU, worked in the more affluent parts of Britain, where the recovery was tangible, but fell on deaf ears elsewhere. During the campaign, Osborne put out figures showing that households in the UK would be \u00a34,300 a year worse off on average by 2030 in the event of Brexit, because the economy would be six percentage points smaller. This had zero impact. In part, that might be because voters were rightly dubious about the Treasury\u2019s ability to make such long-term economic forecasts. But it seems that even those who did think that the economy might be a bit smaller by 2030 took the view that the additional six percentage points of GDP would accrue to rich people living inside the M25 and not to them. All the evidence suggests that this was a perfectly logical assumption. In essence, the referendum divided Britain between those who were doing well out of the status quo and those who weren\u2019t. The latter group wanted change and appear to be willing to risk a recession to get it. And change there has certainly been. Osborne has been fired, his ludicrous idea of a post-Brexit \u201cpunishment\u201d budget has been scrapped, and the idea of balancing the budget by the end of the parliament rightly abandoned. The Treasury has been told to put growth before deficit reduction, a change of tack that is long overdue, and will have to work with a business department that has the crafting of an industrial strategy as part of its remit. A stimulus package will be announced by the Bank next month. Brexit has also forced the rest of the EU to have a rethink, with a debate under way between those who think that the response should be a drive for closer integration and a more powerful group, which believes that the dream of political union is dead in the water. As in the UK, budgetary rules will be loosened, and not before time. None of this should disguise the enormity of the challenges ahead. But Britain\u2019s economy is dysfunctional and needs to be fixed. The same applies to the eurozone, only more so. Brexit provides an opportunity to try alternatives to failed policies. There is no guarantee that this opportunity will be seized. However, when the remainers talk of themselves as a persecuted minority and embrace the idea of recession with such relish, they should be aware of how they might sound to the people that Haldane spoke to in Nottingham: pampered, vindictive and unable to accept that they lost.",

A stimulus package will be announced by the Bank next month.</p> <p>Brexit has also forced the rest of the EU to have a rethink, with a debate under way between those who think that the response should be a drive for closer integration and a more powerful group, which believes that the dream of political union is dead in the water. As in the UK, budgetary rules will be loosened, and not before time.</p> <p>None of this should disguise the enormity of the challenges ahead. But Britain\u2019s economy is dysfunctional and needs to be fixed. The same applies to the eurozone, only more so. Brexit provides an opportunity to try alternatives to failed policies. There is no guarantee that this opportunity will be seized. However, when the remainers talk of themselves as a persecuted minority and embrace the idea of recession with such relish, they should be aware of how they might sound to the people that Haldane spoke to in Nottingham: pampered, vindictive and unable to accept that they lost.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook is offering free holiday cancellations to customers due to fly out to Turkey on Sunday following the failed military coup in the country. But other operators, including British Airways, Thomson and First Choice said flights were returning to normal following temporary cancellations. According to the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), 50,000 British holidaymakers are currently believed to be in Turkey. The country was rocked on Friday and Saturday by violence in Istanbul and Ankara, which claimed more than 250 lives. Most of the holidaymakers are staying in coastal resorts several hundred miles from the cities where the violent coup was suppressed. Abta said the situation remained fluid and urged travellers to follow the latest Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice. The FCO said the situation in Turkey appeared to be calming but added: \u201cThe security environment, however, remains potentially volatile. Following earlier disruption, flights to and from airports in Turkey are returning to normal, although some disruption remains.\u201d It told travellers to \u201cavoid public places, in particular demonstrations, and remain vigilant. Take sensible precautions if you are in the vicinity of any military or security forces.\u201d The FCO said the coastal resorts \u201cdo not appear to be significantly affected at present\u201d, but there was evidence there had been violence in Marmaris, one of Turkey\u2019s south-western coastal resorts. Tim Trott, a British tourist, told the BBC he had seen a helicopter \u201cpushing down air-to-ground fire\u201d on a nearby location where the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, was believed to have been staying. He said there had been armed soldiers in the hotel lobby. \u201cNo one I am speaking to is looking to venture out,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the Turkish contingent [who were staying in the hotel] have now gone.\u201d Thomson and First Choice said they would be running all of their flights on Monday as normal to the resorts of Bodrum, Antalya, Izmir and Dalaman. \u201cAll flights departing on Monday 18 July 2016 are operating as normal,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are continuing to closely monitor the situation, together with the relevant authorities. The safety and security of our customers and crew is our highest priority and we follow the advice of the UK government and the FCO.\u201d Thomas Cook had been advising customers to \u201cstay in their hotels until further notice\u201d, but a later statement from the company \u2013 which offers holidays to places such as Marmaris, Bodrum and Antalya \u2013 said: \u201cOur flight and holiday programme is operating as normal and our staff on the ground in resort tell us that everything is calm and customers are enjoying their holidays.\u201d British Airways on Sunday was due to run two of its three scheduled flights to Istanbul, following earlier cancellations, but said they might be subject to delays. \u201cWe continue to keep our flights to Turkey under review and we recommend that customers check ba.com for the latest information,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe safety and security of our customers and crew are always our top priority and we would never operate a flight unless it was safe to do so.\u201d An easyJet spokeswoman said the airline did not expect any changes to its schedule, while Turkish Airlines advised passengers to check the latest flight information for cancellations. The attempted coup came after many tourists had already abandoned plans to holiday in Turkey this year. In May, Thomas Cook said summer holiday bookings to Turkey had slumped. Last year it accounted for 23% of the tour operator\u2019s bookings but this had fallen to 5% even before the weekend\u2019s violence.",

    "webTitle": "Brexit impact is going to be horrible, says leading City fund manager", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the leading money managers in the City of London has said the fallout from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU will be \u201chorrible\u201d and that the Square Mile is still \u201cslightly stunned\u201d by the result. Richard Buxton, the chief executive and head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors (OMGI), which manages \u00a326bn of funds on behalf of individual investors and institutions, said warnings from the pro-EU campaign about the impact of Brexit before the referendum were well placed. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was doom-mongering, because it is absolutely going to be horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cMark Carney\u2019s speech [in which he warned of dangers of Brexit] was absolutely spot on. This is just really bad news. \u201cYou can criticise the Brexit team for a) an utterly mendacious campaign and b) not expecting that they would really win, so never having a plan. I mean the whole thing is literally unbelievable. It is extraordinary how we have ended up where we are.\u201d Buxton has worked in investments for 31 years and is regarded as the City\u2019s leading stock picker, alongside his rival Neil Woodford. Funds worth more than \u00a31bn left Schroders and went into Old Mutual when Buxton moved between the two companies in 2013. He said Brexit is not as immediately dangerous as the financial crisis in 2008, when cashpoints were 30 minutes away from running out of money. However, he remains concerned. \u201cUnlike an election result, where \u2018OK, it\u2019s not great, but in five years\u2019 time it can be reversed\u2019, this is stupendously final,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t always agree with Martin Wolf [the Financial Times columnist], but when he wrote the day after that this is probably the single worst event in British postwar history, yeah, I don\u2019t disagree. \u201cIn terms of the markets, you have seen this massive polarisation, literally 60-70% share price differential within days, between British American Tobacco [which went up due to the weakness of sterling against the dollar] and a housebuilder [that went down]. That is without precedent.\u201d Buxton said workers in the City and at OMGI were still coming to terms with the vote. \u201cI think people are still slightly stunned,\u201d he said. \u201cComing to terms with this is that classic cycle that you go through in terms of shock, grief, anger, all of that. We are very early into this. \u201cOur mood here is we\u2019re \u2018glass half full\u2019 people. We have pulled together. A lot of people have come in without being called; they were in early from that Friday [24 June] onwards. People have come together when they have needed to in terms of queries from regulators on liquidity and flows, and so on.\u201d The threat of redemptions \u2013 investors withdrawing their money from funds \u2013 is serious in the city. Several property funds blocked investors from taking out their money amid panic that the uncertainty caused by the referendum result could cause property prices to fall. Buxton admitted that OMGI had seen \u201cmodest outflows\u201d, but said a major overseas client had pumped more money into its funds because it believed that the fall in the value of sterling and tumbling share price provided a buying opportunity. \u201cWe are OK, but clearly we have got to accept that over the next six months we will have to work with our clients. At the moment, we are even struggling to get appointments with people because they are just head down, in the bunker, don\u2019t want to know, don\u2019t want to talk anyone and don\u2019t want to think about doing anything. That will fade over time, but it\u2019s how can we get out to people and say \u2018look, we do still think there are some amazing investment opportunities here\u2019.\u201d Buxton said the stock market had already priced in a \u201cpretty significant recession\u201d for the UK, with falls in the value of housebuilders, commercial property companies and financial institutions. \u201cNow I think the economy is going to judder to a halt [or] have a mild recession, but I don\u2019t think it is going to be as severe as some of these shares are pricing in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, there is no mad rush to add to or buy into some of those stocks, because the real economy is only going to gradually emerge over the next three to six months.\u201d The OMGI chief executive also warned of continued volatility in trading for the near term, because of the uncertainty surrounding the deal that Britain would negotiate with the EU. With Theresa May in place as prime minister and Philip Hammond as chancellor, the City is focusing on what policies the new government might pursue. Hammond, Buxton said, had \u201cwalked into one of the most unusual economic environments I have known in my 30-year investment career\u201d. \u201cI am pretty sure that the government will, in the autumn statement, do some fiscal weakening, such as reducing stamp duty on housing transactions, cutting petrol taxes to offset the increase that will come from the weaker currency,\u201d Buxton said. \u201cThe bigger question is: are they bolder? Do they go \u2018right, well we are in a different world; if we can borrow at a ludicrously low rates through extensive debt issuance, then let\u2019s do so, specifically to invest either directly or alongside private investors in infrastructure projects\u2019. \u201cWe could resurface [the] M1 [motorway], we have a clear need for more gas-fired electricity generational plants. The private sector is not stepping up and doing any of this, unsurprisingly, so lets do some funding, some guarantees, make things attractive. \u201cIt will be interesting whether they do that. But clearly, even just the former measures, let alone the latter, mean the budget deficit is going to be swinging out again. Now, that, to my way of thinking, is why sterling is weak and could weaken further, to be honest. Already it [the deficit] wasn\u2019t coming in quick enough, but it is going to start expanding.\u201d As for the response of his company, Buxton said OMGI would open a new office in Dublin if it needed to, but predicted that there was unlikely to be any \u201cclarity\u201d for two years as the UK negotiated to leave the EU. \u201cFor now, the UK is still a member of Europe [the EU] and we can still do everything that we were doing,\u201d he said.",

People have come together when they have needed to in terms of queries from regulators on liquidity and flows, and so on.\u201d<br></p> <p>The threat of redemptions \u2013 investors withdrawing their money from funds \u2013 is serious in the city.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/aviva-halts-trading-in-its-property-fund-brexit-standard-life\"> Several property funds</a> blocked investors from taking out their money amid panic that the uncertainty caused by the referendum result could cause property prices to fall.</p> <p>Buxton admitted that OMGI had seen \u201cmodest outflows\u201d, but said a major overseas client had pumped more money into its funds because it believed that the fall in the value of sterling and tumbling share price provided a buying opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cWe are OK, but clearly we have got to accept that over the next six months we will have to work with our clients. At the moment, we are even struggling to get appointments with people because they are just head down, in the bunker, don\u2019t want to know, don\u2019t want to talk anyone and don\u2019t want to think about doing anything. That will fade over time, but it\u2019s how can we get out to people and say \u2018look, we do still think there are some amazing investment opportunities here\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Buxton said the stock market had already priced in a \u201cpretty significant recession\u201d for the UK, with falls in the value of housebuilders, commercial property companies and financial institutions. </p> <p>\u201cNow I think the economy is going to judder to a halt [or] have a mild recession, but I don\u2019t think it is going to be as severe as some of these shares are pricing in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, there is no mad rush to add to or buy into some of those stocks, because the real economy is only going to gradually emerge over the next three to six months.\u201d</p> <p>The OMGI chief executive also warned of continued volatility in trading for the near term, because of the uncertainty surrounding the deal that Britain would negotiate with the EU. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/jun/24/mark-carney-seeks-to-reassure-financial-markets-after-brexit-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4myve\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2574113\"            data-video-name=\"Mark Carney seeks to reassure financial markets after Brexit \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-576d3be4e4b0be24d34f5edf\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/06/24/160624MarkCarney_KP-28185295_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/06/24/160624MarkCarney_KP-28185295.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/06/24/160624MarkCarney_KP-28185295_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/06/24/160624MarkCarney_KP-28185295_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/06/24/160624MarkCarney_KP-28185295_synd_768k_vp8-1.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/jun/24/mark-carney-seeks-to-reassure-financial-markets-after-brexit-video\">Mark Carney seeks to reassure financial markets after Brexit</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>With Theresa May in place as prime minister and Philip Hammond as chancellor, the City is focusing on what policies the new government might pursue. Hammond, Buxton said, had \u201cwalked into one of the most unusual economic environments I have known in my 30-year investment career\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cI am pretty sure that the government will, in the autumn statement, do some fiscal weakening, such as reducing stamp duty on housing transactions, cutting petrol taxes to offset the increase that will come from the weaker currency,\u201d Buxton said. </p> <p>\u201cThe bigger question is: are they bolder? Do they go \u2018right, well we are in a different world; if we can borrow at a ludicrously low rates through extensive debt issuance, then let\u2019s do so, specifically to invest either directly or alongside private investors in infrastructure projects\u2019.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe could resurface [the] M1 [motorway], we have a clear need for more gas-fired electricity generational plants. The private sector is not stepping up and doing any of this, unsurprisingly, so lets do some funding, some guarantees, make things attractive. </p> <p>\u201cIt will be interesting whether they do that. But clearly, even just the former measures, let alone the latter, mean the budget deficit is going to be swinging out again. Now, that, to my way of thinking, is why sterling is weak and could weaken further, to be honest. Already it [the deficit] wasn\u2019t coming in quick enough, but it is going to start expanding.\u201d</p> <p>As for the response of his company, Buxton said OMGI would open a new office in Dublin if it needed to, but predicted that there was unlikely to be any \u201cclarity\u201d for two years as the UK negotiated to leave the EU.</p> <p>\u201cFor now, the UK is still a member of Europe [the EU] and we can still do everything that we were doing,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Five years after its creation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is shifting its attention from its core areas of focus \u2013 mortgages, student loans and other products sold directly to individual consumers \u2013 to an issue that for many Americans is equally important but that so far has not been tackled head-on. How can women get a loan to launch a small business? It sounds a straightforward question, doesn\u2019t it? Surely it\u2019s just a matter of marching into your bank, filling out the forms, supplying a business plan and all the necessary documentation and waiting for a response. Too often, though, that answer is likely to be \u201cno\u201d. And it is entirely possible that gender may be the reason for such a rejection. Two years ago, a report by Democratic staffers of the Senate small business and entrepreneurship committee finally managed to nail down some numbers. While women owned 30% of US businesses, they calculated, for every dollar of conventional small business loans that they received, another $23 went to men. That juxtaposition, the staffers argued, didn\u2019t make sense. If so many women were running so many businesses so successfully, why did so few qualify for loans? That funding gap is important for the US economy since, according to a recent survey commissioned by American Express Open, female-owned businesses not only employ 9 million people and generate $1.6tn a year in revenue, but they are growing at five times the national average. Since 2007, more than 1,000 female-owned businesses have opened their doors every day and their hiring has grown consistently, even when that of male-owned small businesses has flagged. If women can\u2019t get access to capital, then those benefits will be capped. There are plenty of valid reasons why women might not qualify for loans. The business proposals might not be robust enough. Their credit scores might not be high enough. But one study, published by the Institute of Government &amp; Public Affairs and based on an analysis of lending in Chicago, found that even after adjusting the data to take into account factors like creditworthiness, gender has a dramatic impact on both access to loans and the size of the credit line a bank will grant to a small business owner. Not surprisingly, so does race. Hence the CFPB\u2019s tentative foray into cracking down on discrimination in small business lending. The agency already requires banks to collect and provide data on the gender, race and ethnicity of applicants for mortgages. Now it will ask lenders to do the same for anyone applying for a commercial loan. This is covered under Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and while the CFPB has been slow to get moving on the issue, in April it recruited a former Small Business Administration official, Grady Hedgespeth, to oversee the move. Getting solid data \u2013 as opposed to the results of surveys like those conducted for American Express and the Senate committee staffers \u2013 will be a step in the right direction. But what follows from that? There are some indications that being denied funding has less to do with the content of your business plan and more to do with who you are, and sometimes what you look like. Consider a series of studies conducted by scholars at Harvard Business School, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and the MIT Sloan School of Management, designed to figure out what kind of investment pitches from entrepreneurs are most successful in wooing \u201cangel\u201d investors. It turns out that backers of startup companies prefer to invest their money with attractive men than any women, whether attractive or not \u2013 even if the content of the business proposals is identical. It\u2019s not surprising, therefore, that women aren\u2019t just at a disadvantage in the universe of bank lending, but in the venture capital universe, where less than 7% of all venture capital funds are allocated to companies founded by women. The Silicon Valley \u201cbros\u201d fund guys who look like them. One anonymous female entrepreneur went public with the advice she received, to hire \u201ca nerdy looking dude to represent your company publicly. You know, to make up for your looks\u201d. (Even then, women don\u2019t always stay at the helm of the companies they launch \u2013 Zipcar\u2019s two founders are an example.) It\u2019s all a vicious circle. Venture capital firms tend to recruit partners from the ranks of successful CEOs. So the fewer women who get funding and launch startups, the smaller the pool of candidates becomes. And yet Vivek Wadhwa, a noted Silicon Valley entrepreneur, has pointed to a list of findings that should challenge the perception that women aren\u2019t worth backing. They run businesses in a more capital-efficient manner; their startups fail less frequently; they have higher revenues; and organizations that include more women have higher returns on equity. There are some pinpoints of light here that should be encouraged. First of all, if you have a pension fund that invests in venture capital, encourage it to take a look at some of the new female-run venture capital funds. Their founders will be just as tough when it comes to evaluating a business plan, but likely won\u2019t don the same kind of gender blinkers. The more capital they have at their disposal to put to work, the more the imbalance in funding can be redressed. Secondly, advocate for the CFPB and its efforts. The banks will soon begin pushing back \u2013 yet again \u2013 against the agency\u2019s attempt to collect this data, worried that it will bring with it a bunch of lawsuits about \u201cpinklining\u201d. So what? If banks have been mis-selling products to women, especially poorer women or women of color, based on their gender, they need to be held accountable. And the agency needs to have the budget to do its work properly. Thirdly, support educational efforts under way locally and nationally that ensure that women are able to take advantage of opportunities that do exist to borrow, when they have a great business idea and the market timing is right. Grameen America, for example, doesn\u2019t just offer microloans. It works with low-income women to help them build savings and credit scores. Finally, keep an eye on the crowdfunding world. While this can be a bit of a perilous area for inexperienced investors, it also can be a boon for small business owners seeking startup capital who have been turned down for more conventional loans. One early study of Kickstarter projects (from 2009 to 2012) found that 69.5% of those posted by women were likely to be funded, while only 61.4% of men\u2019s business plans got funding. A second survey, published in 2014, replicated those findings, and found the results were particularly striking for technology companies: 65% of companies and projects posted by women were funded, compared to only 30% for men. Crowdfunding isn\u2019t a panacea, however. While the number of deals and their dollar value is growing, it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to fill up what the big commercial banks could do. It has been 28 years since Ronald Reagan signed the Women\u2019s Business Ownership Act, legislation that for the first time made it illegal for states to pass laws requiring women to have a man cosign a business loan. It\u2019s time to ensure that women can take full advantage of the opportunities it should have created, and banish the more subtle forms of discrimination that endure.",

      "bodyText": "Without the European Union\u2019s shackles, Britain will be free to develop new products and innovate for greater success. Like a gleaming stallion racing away from the herd, the UK will leave Europe\u2019s deadbeat economy in the dust. It\u2019s a Brexiters\u2019 image that also pictures Europe falling back, unable to maintain its poise while protecting the interests of unionised workers and ageing elites. The most recent economic figures appear to bear this out, with lower growth posing a fresh problem for Brussels and European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi, who had presumed that increases in GDP, while still only moderate, were steady and assured. And it\u2019s true that policymakers in Denmark, Sweden and even some quarters of liberal Germany fear that, without the UK, Europe will turn inwards and ossify, forcing them to question their own membership. Governments in Portugal and Spain have added to the pain, going head to head with Brussels after they broke through their budget ceilings. Italy wants to pump \u20ac40bn into its banks against eurozone rules. In all cases, ministers are attempting to shore up outmoded or bust institutions. The question for Brexit campaigners is whether Britain is so very different to its continental cousins and can grow in a way that satisfies the demand of most Brexit voters. And to that question, the answer must be no. Britain has seen a renaissance in jobs since 2013, of that there is no doubt. But most of those extra jobs were among the self-employed or fell into categories that can only be described as insecure and low-paid. When companies finally took the plunge and advertised full-time jobs from 2014 onwards, around a third went to migrants. If you turn off the migration tap and regulate insecure jobs out of existence, as no doubt the voters of Brexit-loving Stoke-on-Trent would like, you have no growth. Overnight Britain becomes France, weighed down by high unemployment and low growth after sticking with policies that protect the terms and conditions of the current generation of workers, and discourage investment. It is this mostly older group of workers across the developed world, worried about their pay, pensions and conditions of employment, that want to slam the brakes on globalisation and reject the remedy proposed by big business: greater labour-market flexibility and only limited job protections. The same issue is causing social turmoil in the US, where a strong economic recovery from the 2008 crash is largely driven by consistently high net immigration filling gaps in the labour market and bringing new ideas and skills to places like Silicon Valley. Voters bridling against a diet of constant change are the bedrock of Donald Trump\u2019s push for the White House. Economists for Brexit, a 13-strong group who championed the UK quitting the EU, want British voters to embrace the anxiety that comes with flexible working and rates of pay that go up and down in line with the demand for their services, as determined by global capitalism. Of course their message is more optimistic and is about developing high-skilled jobs. And they are not such principled free marketeers they can\u2019t find room to offset their call for unfettered free trade with a bit of government subsidy directed at hard-pressed parts of the economy, particularly manufacturing and agriculture. Infrastructure spending with borrowed money is also allowed. But it is noticeable that the US-style green card entry system they propose would shift the balance towards high-skilled workers without necessarily cutting the numbers. As the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan said a day after the vote, a points system to determine who can work in the UK and who can\u2019t would not on its own prevent the population growing by 1 million every three years, mostly through immigration. And when you have new chancellor Philip Hammond saying that Britons need to fall over themselves to attract overseas investors upset at Brexit, putting a lower corporation tax rate at the top of his list, it is only a matter of a few years before the people of Stoke-on-Trent begin to feel conned again. Like all other countries, Britain needs to increase demand to escape or at least ameliorate the deflationary spiral gripping the global economy. The G20 finance ministers meet this week and will reiterate the need for governments to supplement central bank funds in boosting growth. Only government can provide the cure, with a commitment to invest where the private sector cannot or will not go. That means Theresa May will need to bust George Osborne\u2019s budget forecasts by more than a few billion to implement an industrial strategy worthy of the name. The temptation will be to spend the money on an industrial commission or research centre to advise ministers on the way forward. Vince Cable did all this when he was business minister and implemented what he could. He was stopped in his tracks by Osborne when he wanted to spend some money. Yet there are oven-ready projects across the country that could be commissioned, encouraging contractors to invest in new equipment and skills. Will they be commissioned? Not if the nation\u2019s ageing nimbys block each individual proposal. And not if the concern persists that governments cannot be trusted to spend taxpayer funds and get good value.",

      "bodyText": "A lot has changed since George Osborne announced Andrew Bailey as new head of the Financial Conduct Authority less than six months ago. Osborne was then in his post-election pomp and seen as the most likely successor to David Cameron. He had ousted Martin Wheatley, Bailey\u2019s predecessor, for being too tough on the banks and declared interim boss Tracey McDermott out of the running without warning her. But Bailey, who started on 1 July, had barely got his feet under the desk before Theresa May replaced Osborne with Philip Hammond, whose views on regulation we don\u2019t yet know. The FCA is, of course, set up as an independent watchdog, but it can\u2019t help notice the way the political wind is blowing. After May\u2019s attack on \u201cthe privileged few\u201d, Osborne\u2019s push to cosy up to the City may not be so fashionable. So it\u2019s a great week for Bailey, who joined from the Bank of England, to face questions at the FCA\u2019s annual meeting on Tuesday and then from Andrew Tyrie and the gang at the Treasury committee the next day. Potential subjects for discussion include the dropping-off of FCA fines to a trickle this year, delays in getting new firms authorised and staffing levels that appear to be stretched. What are morale and employee turnover like after Osborne\u2019s dismissal of Wheatley and McDermott? Commercial property crisis brews Commercial property has been one of the biggest business casualties of the Brexit vote, so it\u2019s good timing that Land Securities and British Land report on trading this week. Since 4 July, seven funds invested in office blocks, retail parks and the like have barred withdrawals or cut their value as retail investors head for the door. The Bank of England has warned commercial property prices, especially in London, are too high. It\u2019s easy to see how things could go wrong. Foreign investment, which has fuelled the boom, is ebbing, and values are falling on concerns about the economy. As Mike Prew, an analyst at Jefferies, points out, commercial property is mainly funded by bank lending and owners of property have taken on more debt. Smaller banks are more exposed than big lenders and 75% of small- and medium-sized companies use property as collateral. The share prices of commercial real estate companies have fallen heavily since the referendum result. Land Securities and British Land are the two biggest and their trading updates will coincide with their annual general meetings this week. Shareholders should inquire about this brew of risks. Lack of direction at easyJet? What is going on post-Brexit at easyJet, which publishes a trading update on Thursday? On the Friday of the referendum result, the budget airline issued a vague but reassuring statement saying that it would continue to achieve long-term earnings growth and returns for shareholders. But the following Monday it published a more detailed update listing problems in the European aviation industry such as cancellations and saying Brexit had made things worse. Analysts were bemused by the timing of the two statements but didn\u2019t get the chance to question Carolyn McCall, easyJet\u2019s chief executive. There are also questions about how Brexit will affect easyJet\u2019s ability to fly throughout Europe and where it will base its operations. The message from the company is that it may need one or two extra air operator certificates, in addition to its UK and Swiss ones now, but that would mean placing a handful of employees in a particular country. It all depends on the deal the new government manages to get from the EU. Whatever the outcome, easyJet\u2019s head office and its 1,000 employees would stay at Luton airport, a spokesman said. Still, there\u2019s nothing like hearing things from the boss, so there will be plenty to talk about when McCall faces analysts for the first time since the Brexit vote.",
