      "bodyText": "Mortgages for homeowners and buy-to-let landlords could become more expensive under new rules being imposed by international regulators, an industry trade body has warned. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said the global rules were likely to have \u201cunintended and negative consequences\u201d for buy-to-let borrowers and those borrowing to finance the purchase of their own home. It warned that the Basel committee on banking supervision \u2013 which sets rules to be adopted by national banking regulators \u2013 could require lenders to amass bigger capital cushions against home loans. This would push up the cost of borrowing. The CML said in response to a consultation issued by the Switzerland-based committee: \u201cProposed changes by international banking regulators to the rules for assessing credit risk do not reflect the real underlying risk of those assets and would result in unduly harsh capital treatment of both prime residential and buy-to-let mortgages.\u201d It added: \u201cIn current market conditions, mortgage funding is available and attractively prices and UK consumers are enjoying some of the lowest rates ever. But capital requirements that are excessive relative to the risk of the underlying assets are likely to affect the cost and availability of mortgages.\u201d The CML said that new mortgage regulation in the UK, which contains affordability tests for borrowers, were being overlooked by the regulators in Switzerland. It also raises questions about whether the new rules would have to be applied to existing lending and not just new loans. There could also be implications for homeowners wanting to increase the value of their existing mortgage because of the way the rules are being drafted. For instance, a loan worth 81% of the value of a property would require more capital - and be more expensive - than a loan for 79% of the value of a property. As the CML published its response to the Basel committee, ratings agency Moody\u2019s said that new rules being introduced by the UK government would make the buy-to-let market \u2013 and the entire banking sector \u2013 safer. In the autumn statement, George Osborne announced a three percentage-point premium on stamp duty on buy-to-let properties and second homes. Riccardo Rinaldini, an analyst at Moody\u2019s said these change should help to \u201ctemper the growth\u201d of the buy-to-let sector. \u201cThis should reduce the tail risk of a sharp decline in house prices from a concentrated market sell-off when interest rates eventually rise,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWe consider buy-to-let mortgages to be inherently riskier than owner-occupied mortgages,\u201d said Rinaldini. \u201cIf borrowing costs rise and rental income no longer covers landlords\u2019 interest payments, a broad based sell-off of BTL properties could fuel a fall in house prices, negatively affecting all banks and building societies in the UK.\u201d Approximately 15% of all outstanding residential loans to individuals are for buy-to-lot properties and the Bank of England has repeatedly said it is watching the buy-to-let mortgage market. In December, the Bank said it was scrutinising the terms under which mortgages are being granted to buy-to-let landlords, for fear they could be more vulnerable than other borrowers to a rise in interest rates. It has also asked for formal powers to rein in the market. Moody\u2019s said that the current low unemployment and low-interest rate environment had held down arrears for buy-to-let mortgages and would not affect the credit quality of the lenders it rates. It added: \u201cThat said, a loosening of underwriting criteria or attempts to aggressively boost market share in the BTL market are far more likely to put downward pressure on standalone credit assessments, given the increase in the cost of risk that could materialise in an economic downturn.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Market rally continues but oil falls as Opec warns on excess supply - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Despite weak Chinese data over the weekend and a drop in the oil price, investors pushed stock markets higher ahead of this week\u2019s raft of central bank meetings. The poor Chinese retail sales and industrial production figures only served to suggest there could be further stimulus measures from the country\u2019s central bank to boost its economy. So for the moment we are in bad news is good territory once more. As for the oil price, the slide below $40 a barrel for Brent did not upset the generally positive mood. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today has marked a positively tranquil start for European markets, which have been grinding higher following on from the post-ECB rally seen last week. Tentative signs of weakness in the crude markets have sent jitters across the commodity space, with energy, precious metals and base metals all suffering on the day. This decoupling of commodity prices and equity markets highlights a possible end to the direct linkage between crude and stocks which has dominated the trading landscape over recent months. The upbeat mood follows last week\u2019s stronger than expected stimulus measures from the European Central Bank, but now all eyes are on the Bank of Japan, US Federal Reserve and Bank of England, all of whom meet this week. So more volatility is likely in the coming days, but for the moment, the final scores for the day showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.78 points or 0.57% at 6174.57 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.62% to 9990.26 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.31% higher at 4506.59 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was virtually unchanged, down just 0.03% at 18,981.77 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.57% at 9142.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.37% to 566.20 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 18 points or 0.11% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The negative news for the oil price continues. After Opec said excess supply would be higher than previously thought this year and Iran dashed hopes of a co-ordinated cut in output, came reports that US crude stockpiles continued to rise. Information firm Genscape said inventories at Cushing in Oklahoma, the delivery hub for US crude, rose by 585,854 barrels, according to Reuters. So Brent crude continues to sit in negative territory, down 2.6% to $39.32 a barrel, although off its worst levels of the day of $38.82. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is down nearly 4% at $36.97. Oil continues to slide: Anyone waiting for the \u2018major announcement\u2019 from Bangladesh after cyber thieves stole $81m from the central bank\u2019s accounts.....will have to wait a little longer it appears. To recap, the country\u2019s finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has heavily criticised Bangladesh Bank for not alerting the government to the theft earlier, and said a statement concerning the central bank would be made shortly. However Reuters is reporting that the announcement will now be made on Tuesday rather than today. It says central bank governor Atiur Rahman has been in India for a conference and arrived back late on Monday. Opec\u2019s monthly oil report has kept its overall forecast for growth in crude demand unchanged at 1.25m barrels a day for 2016. But it has cut its estimate for demand for the organisation\u2019s own crude, and says its forecast that supply from non-Opec producers will decline by 700,000 is becoming more uncertain. It said rival producers were still trying to maintain output despite low prices. So it expects excess supply in 2016 to increase to 760,000 barrels a day from the previously anticipated 720,000. Some Opec producers have proposed freezing output at January levels, with a meeting between its members and other producers such as Russia reportedly planned for Doha in April. But Iran, which has just returned to the world stage following the lifting of sanctions, is believed to be reluctant to agree to a freeze. Overall Opec said its output fell by 175,000 barrels a day in February to 32.28m barrels compared to January. The Opec report comes after the International Energy Agency said last week it believed oil prices - which have slumped on a glut of supply and falling demand - might have bottomed out. Brent crude is currently down 3% at $39.17. Last week\u2019s European Central Bank announcement included - as well as a further rate cuts - the proposal to buy bonds through its QE programme issued by companies and not just financial institutions. Here is a note of what has been bought so far through the QE programme: Another big share mover today is GW Pharmaceuticals, a pharmaceutical business which develops cannabis-based treatments. Its shares have more than doubled after news that its Epidiolex drug had significantly reduced seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome, a type of epilesy for which there are currently no treatments approved in the US, compared to a placebo. The full story is here: The Starwood news has also prompted thoughts of further consolidation in the sector, helping push up shares in UK-listed InterContinental Hotels by more than 4% to \u00a328.45. Shares in hotel chain Starwood have soared in early New York trading, after a Chinese consortium launched an audacious $13bn takeover bid. Chinese insurance group Anbang is leading the group, which is proposing to pay $76 per share in cash for Starwood, which owns the Sheraton, St Regis and W Hotels chains. That may have come as a nasty shock to Marriott, which reached an agreement to acquire Starwood last November at an estimated $63.74 a share. Starwood has said this new offer is \u201chighly conditional and non-binding\u201d. But Wall Street reckons it is serious, sending the group\u2019 shares up 6.6% to over $75... The US stock market has just opened for the week, surprising any European who didn\u2019t realise America put its clocks forward yesterday (ahem). Shares are dipping in early trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 26 points or 0.15%. Investors may be cautious ahead of this week\u2019s two-day Federal Reserve meeting, which culminates with a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the Fed faces a \u201cdelicate balancing act\u201d this week. They will want to sound cautious about the economic outlook, without causing panic, while also probably predicting three rate rises this year. The fact that markets only discount a 20% chance of a rate hike in April, and a 43% probability of a June move, highlights that this delicate balancing act will be no easy task. Germany\u2019s Berenberg has become the latest bank to predict turmoil if Britain votes to leave the European Union. In a new report, Berenberg identified the usual risks, including a weak pound, slower growth, and a sharp hit to business confidence. It also floated the prospect of London mayor Boris Johnson ending up in Number 10 Downing Street. Here\u2019s the key points from Berenberg\u2019s Kallum Pickering: \u00b7 In the short-run, a vote for Brexit would be a demand-side shock: A sharp rise in uncertainty would harm business and household confidence, causing investment and spending to decline. Growth slows (recession possible), unemployment rises, the Bank of England (BoE) loosens monetary policy and fiscal deficits rise. \u00b7 Our key tail risk \u2013 a sterling crisis: A loss of confidence by markets leads to a run on sterling. This remains a low-probability event. But we cannot rule it out given the UK\u2019s serious twin deficits. It would probably require the BoE to hike, despite weak demand, in order to support the pound, counter inflation and keep capital in the country. \u00b7 In the long run, we are still alive: Eventually, growth would return to more-normal patterns. But slower population growth, weaker investment and limits on free trade would likely reduce the UK\u2019s potential growth rate \u2013 the size of this shock would depend on the new trade agreements with the EU and other countries. \u00b7 Boris for Prime Minister: David Cameron would likely resign as Prime Minister, creating turmoil in the Conservative Party. Boris Johnson would likely win a leadership battle against other prominent \u201couters\u201d in the Conservative Party. Anti-UK parties in pro-EU Scotland would push for another referendum \u2013 with a modest to high chance that a new vote ends in Scotland leaving this time. \u00b7 Norway style? The UK will likely try to strike a deal for preferential access to the EU market. Of the three most likely options, Norwegian-style membership of the European Economic Association (EEA) would be the least bad. But this might not be on offer. And, even if it were, the UK might have to accept serious concessions that are far worse than those which Mr Cameron\u2019s new \u201cin\u201d terms avoid. EEA membership would give the UK autonomy over its external trade policy towards non-European Union countries, which it does not have currently as an EU member. But the UK on its own may lack the clout to strike better deals with Asia and the US than the much bigger EU can. Egypt\u2019s stock market has soared by 6% following the surprise devaluation of the Egyptian pound this morning. Investors are confident that the move will help Egypt\u2019s economy, by attracting overseas capital back to the country. But it\u2019s also likely to be inflationary, so Egyptian businesses and consumers should expect higher borrowing costs soon. Jason Tuvey, a Middle East economist at Capital Economics, told Reuters that: \u201cInevitably there will be short-term pain as inflation rises, and the central bank will hike rates at its meeting on Thursday, probably in the order of 100 basis points. But in time the devaluation will bring benefits to Egypt...and encourage foreign investors back to the country.\u201d A former top Irish banker appeared in a Dublin court today, to face charges relating to the collapse of one of the country\u2019s fallen lenders. David Drumm, former CEO of Anglo Irish Bank, was arrested in the early hours of Monday after arriving at Dublin Airport. He had fought attempts to extradite him from the US for several months, before dropping his legal challenge in February. Prosecutors are arguing that Drumm should not get bail, as our Ireland correspondent Henry McDonald reports: The 49-year old was formally charged at a north Dublin police station after arriving at Dublin airport from Boston on Monday morning . Drumm is accused of forgery, conspiracy and false accounting for loans in 2008 designed to rescue Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s share price. The Dublin-born banker denies any wrongdoing. The charges carry prison sentences ranging from a maximum of five years, up to an unlimited term of imprisonment. Anglo Irish played a crucial role in the Irish property boom, which collapsed after the financial crisis. The bank was nationalised in 2009, after sinking under billions of euros of bad property debts. Henry explains: After the rescue of Anglo Irish Bank, it was nationalised and renamed the Irish Banking Resolution Corporation. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic boom, when it became the major financier for overstretched Irish developers and investors playing the global property market, caused national outrage in Ireland. European stock markets are all comfortably higher as City traders\u2019 minds turn to lunch. After a fairly quiet (ok, dull) morning, the FTSE 100 is up 20 points, with mining stocks still among the biggest risers. And the German DAX is still the standout performer, as Sunday\u2019s state elections fail to spark a panic in Frankfurt. The prospect of more stimulus measures out of China soon are pushing shares higher, says Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG. Monday is likely to be the calm before the storm as a dearth of corporate and economic data will see traders scratching around for a sense of direction ahead of this week\u2019s UK budget and the FOMC\u2019s interest rate decision. Confirmation that China is set to return to its policy of infrastructure spending and equity market support has been as good an excuse as any to see the bulls hold the early morning upper hand. Unsurprisingly, as the Asian beast looks to be awakening from its slumber, the mining sector has been the major beneficiary in the FTSE. Morgan Stanley have also scrapped its prediction that the US central bank would raise interest rates three times in 2016. It now only expects a single hike from the Federal Reserve, in December, reflecting the US economy\u2019s weaker growth prospects. In today\u2019s report, they say: In the US, our economists look for the Fed to delay its next rate hike until the December 2016 FOMC meeting \u2013 a big change from their previous expectation of three hikes this year. Our economists expect quarterly real GDP growth to stay below 2.0% through 2017. We\u2019ll find out on Wednesday if Fed policymakers have changed their own expectations, when the results of this month\u2019s meeting are released. Morgan Stanley has slashed their forecasts for global growth, and warned that the risks of a global downturn have increased. In a new report, analyst at the Wall Street bank cautioned that: Growth remains weak and the probability of a global recession has risen..... Our economists are below consensus on global, emerging markets and developed markets growth and have raised their probability of a global recession within the next 12 months to 30%. They cut their prediction for growth across the world\u2019s 10 largest countries to just 1.5%, down from 1.8%, and halved its forecast for Japanese growth. MS also forecast much deeper recessions in Brazil and Russia this year, reflecting gloom over emerging market prospects. It\u2019s a timely reminder for global central bank chiefs in the UK, US and Japan as they gather to set monetary policy this week. Indeed, MS warns that central bankers are losing the power to keep economies on track. Central banks hold a declining number of less effective policy tools. Their latest foray, negative rates, may do more harm than good. How bad is it if central banks are powerless to boost the economy? Well, it clearly isn\u2019t good. But it also isn\u2019t as \u201cunprecedented\u201d (and therefore bad) as often portrayed. Prior to 2010, central bank easing was usually unable to stop market declines (2002, 2008). And this makes sense; policy can\u2019t change the course of the underlying economy, it can only nudge it one way or the other. Bloomberg agrees that this is a big week for monetary policy, but doesn\u2019t expect any interest rate hikes or cuts: Here\u2019s more details of the surprisingly decent eurozone factory data, from Howard Archer. There were widespread gains in output across sectors in January. In particular, capital goods output jumped 3.2% month-on-month while there were also healthy month-on-month gains for consumer non-durables (2.4%), durables goods (1.3%) and intermediate goods (0.9%). Additionally,energy output rebounded 2.4% month-on-month in January after a dip of 3.4% month-on-month in December when the weather was unseasonably mild. Among the major Eurozone countries, industrial production saw large month-on-month increases in January in Germany (2.9%), Italy (1.9%),France (1.4%) and the Netherlands (2.1%). There was also a mightily impressive jump of 12.7% in Ireland. However, Spanish output edged down 0.2% month-on-month in January. Boom! Eurozone factories have reported a surprisingly strong increase in factory output. Industrial production across the single currency region surged by 2.1% month-on-month in January, and was 2.8% higher than a year ago. That\u2019s an encouraging signal for Europe\u2019s lacklustre economy, which appeared to slow at the start of this year. City economists, such as IHS\u2019s Howard Archer, are impressed: No immediate market reaction, though - with shares still comfortably up this morning. Over in Bangladesh, the government has lashed out at the central bank after cyber thieves pinched $81m from its accounts. Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has promised a \u2018major announcement\u2019 shortly, and heavily criticised Bangladesh Bank for not alerting the government to the theft earlier. As we covered last week, the funds were lifted from an account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last month. The hackers nearly stole $1bn, but authorities noticed they had misspelled \u2018foundation\u2019 as \u2018fandation\u2019 and halted the transfer. Muhith is fuming about the affair, telling reporters that: \u201cBangladesh Bank has the audacity not to inform me..... I am very unhappy about it. The handling of the matter by Bangladesh Bank is very incompetent.\u201d Brent crude oil has fallen back below $40 per barrel this morning, after Iran sank hopes of a co-ordinated production cut. Tamas Varga, oil analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates, explains (via Reuters): \u201cOil is down because Iran said they would only join the output freeze group once they reached production of 4 million barrels a day (bpd).\u201d Brent had hit a three-month high last week, partly due to speculation that producers might agree to slow their pumps. Today\u2019s fall is good news for consumers, but worrying for central bankers as they struggle to get inflation up. Egypt\u2019s central bank has just fired another shot in the currency wars, by devaluing its currency. In an unexpected move, the Egyptian Central Bank cut the value of the Egyptian pound by around 13%. That means one US dollar is now worth 8.85 Egyptian pounds, up from 7.73 before. The move follows a worrying drop in Egypt\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. The Financial Times\u2019s Cairo correspondent, Heba Saleh, explains why that matters: Falling foreign currency inflows have been strangling businesses and threatening imports of basic necessities including medicines. A terrorist bomb that downed a Russian airliner caused a sharp drop in tourist numbers exacerbating already dollar shortages. Egypt\u2019s central bank also announced it would follow a \u201cmore flexible exchange rate policy\u201d - which looks like an admission that it will allow the currency to keep weakening. In Frankfurt, traders have responded to Angela Merkel\u2019s drubbing at the polls...by sending shares soaring. The DAX index has jumped over the 10,000 point mark for the first time since mid-January, making it the best-performing stock market today. Every share is up, with semiconductor firm Infineon Technologies and carmakers Volkswagen and Daimler all up 2.5%. You might have expected shares to suffer from the news that the governing CDU party lost two state elections yesterday. But some analysts argue that those defeats don\u2019t reflect too badly on its leader. Our Berlin bureau chief Philip Oltermann explains: During the campaign, CDU candidates in all three states had distanced themselves to varying degrees from their leader\u2019s strategy for the refugee crisis. The politician who won in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019s, Green state premier Winfried Kretschmann, had passionately defended the German chancellor\u2019s open-borders stance, stating in one day that he was \u201cpraying every day\u201d for her wellbeing. A breeze of optimism has pushed shares higher in London this morning. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 44 points, or 0.75%, to 6184 points. That adds to the 103-points jump recorded on Friday, as traders (belatedly) welcomed the European Central Bank\u2019s latest stimulus package. Mining stocks are leading the rally, which is usually a sign of optimism about growth prospects and the (slowing) Chinese economy. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says traders are expecting Chinese authorities to deliver more stimulus measures - after last weekend\u2019s poor industrial production and retail sales figures. At odds with the old adage \u201cno news is good news\u201d, it would appear it\u2019s more a case of \u201call news is good news\u201d when it comes to China. China\u2019s stock market has also enjoyed a solid day, with the Shanghai Composite index closing 1.7% higher. The rally was sparked by hopes of fresh intervention from Beijing, after a Chinese regulator said it\u2019s too early to consider withdrawing government bailout funds from the market. That helped traders to ignore the latest disappointing Chinese economic data, which showed a sharp slowdown in retail sales (to +10.2%, from +11.1%). Industrial production growth also weakened, to 5.4% from 5.9%. Shares have pushed higher across Asia as the rally that began in Europe last Friday continues. In Japan, the Nikkei jumped by 1.75% to close at 17,233, a one-week high. There were similar gains at other bourses, as investors begin the week in good spirits ahead of this week\u2019s flurry of central bank meetings. Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG in Singapore, says traders are hopeful that US interest rates remain unchanged for a few more months: \u201cInvestors seemed more confident that there is little chance of a March Fed hike this week, but they are anticipating some sort of guidance at the press conference.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u2019s fireworks from the European Central Bank, the world\u2019s other top central banks get their time in the spotlight this week. The Bank of Japan (Tuesday ), the US Federal Reserve (Wednesday) and the Bank of England (Thursday) will all ponder how to set monetary policy to guide their respective counties forward - through the malaise of the global economy. Mario Draghi has set the bar pretty high, by announcing rate cuts and fresh stimulus measures last week. Could the BoJ follow suit? It\u2019s not impossible, given Japan\u2019s persistent deflation and low growth problems. Alastair Winter, chief economist at City bank Daniel Stewart, explains: Recent developments have suggested Prime Minister Abe is applying pressure for even more \u2018growth-friendly\u2019 interventions, especially as Consumer Confidence last week added to the list of dismal data. BoJ Governor Kuroda has become quite skittish of late and his recent remarks that all was going well could presage a further bout of easing, albeit perhaps not this week. A few month ago, investors had expected the Federal Reserve to raise rates at this week\u2019s meeting. That\u2019s now unlikely, given the recent signs of weakness in the global economy. As this chart shows, economists expect the first rate hike in June - but they have been wrong before.... Either way, Fed policymakers will provide new economic forecasts and rate hike predictions, so we\u2019ll get an insight into their mood. But don\u2019t expect too much from the Bank of England; its likely to leave interest rates at just 0.5%, extending a pattern that began in March 2009. Winter again: Meanwhile, Governor Carney has in the past also been criticised for sending out false signals but he has been more consistent recently and, having resisted negative rates and more QE hitherto, is most unlikely to announce any changes on Thursday. So the long period of record low borrowing costs is likely to continue: Also coming up today... OPEC, the oil cartel, is due to publish its latest monthly report today (probably before lunchtime) In the UK, chancellor George Osborne should be putting the finishing touches to his budget, due on Wednesday. It\u2019s likely to be a gloomy affair, with Osborne already admitting that he\u2019ll make \u00a34bn of fresh cuts. And yesterday\u2019s German state elections may have some impact on the markets. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party lost two state seats, with both pro and anti-refugee parties making ground. Not much corporate news or economic data to look forward to, alas, but we\u2019ll do our best.....",

But slower population growth, weaker investment and limits on free trade would likely reduce the UK\u2019s potential growth rate \u2013 the size of this shock would depend on the new trade agreements with the EU and other countries.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>Boris for Prime Minister: </strong>David Cameron would likely resign as Prime Minister, creating turmoil in the Conservative Party. Boris Johnson would likely win a leadership battle against other prominent \u201couters\u201d in the Conservative Party. Anti-UK parties in pro-EU Scotland would push for another referendum \u2013 with a modest to high chance that a new vote ends in Scotland leaving this time.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>Norway style? </strong>The UK will likely try to strike a deal for preferential access to the EU market. Of the three most likely options, Norwegian-style membership of the European Economic Association (EEA) would be the least bad. But this might not be on offer. And, even if it were, the UK might have to accept serious concessions that are far worse than those which Mr Cameron\u2019s new \u201cin\u201d terms avoid. EEA membership would give the UK autonomy over its external trade policy towards non-European Union countries, which it does not have currently as an EU member. But the UK on its own may lack the clout to strike better deals with Asia and the US than the much bigger EU can.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e6b988e4b07324a2d39e06\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-14T13:20:50.726Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b921efdde3f325f69681b05c332b4a74e6bba481\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b921efdde3f325f69681b05c332b4a74e6bba481/0_587_3175_1904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man counts Egyptian currency at an exchange office in Cairo, Egypt, today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man counts Egyptian currency at an exchange office in Cairo, Egypt, today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amr Nabil/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Egypt\u2019s stock market has soared by 6% following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/mar/14/market-rally-central-banks-opec-business-live?page=with:block-56e6807ce4b06de4cb3901b8#block-56e6807ce4b06de4cb3901b8\">the surprise devaluation of the Egyptian pound this morning</a>.</p> <p>Investors are confident that the move will help Egypt\u2019s economy, by attracting overseas capital back to the country.

Its shares climbed 4.5p to 587.5p after the figures were announced on Monday. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cFever-Tree has been the best IPO of the last two years, with the shares up something like 313% \u2026 and is held up by many as a role model for Hotel Chocolat.\u201d The chocolatier plans a \u00a3150m flotation by the end of June. As well as adding Marks &amp; Spencer and British Airways to its list of customers, which also includes Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury, Fever-Tree has struck a deal to supply easyJet with its new 150ml cans. The executive deputy chairman and co-founder, Charles Rolls, said: Fever-Tree\u2019s ongoing success is driven by a global consumer desire and demand to drink premium mixers to complement their premium spirits, and our strong first move advantage \u2026 We maintain that the premium segment is still in its infancy and will continue to outperform the other drinks categories. The company said growth had been strong across its four main geographical regions, and the new year had started well.

We make no changes to forecasts at this stage and our target price remains at 740p. We think the group can deliver underlying growth of about \u00a310m to \u00a312m per annum. Growth over and above this will be determined by sizeable wins in the off-trade, although these are less predictable.

GW said a clinical trial showed its Epidiolex drug had significantly reduced seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome, a type of epilepsy for which there are currently no treatments approved in the US, compared to a placebo. In the trial of 120 patients, those taking Epidiolex saw a reduction of monthly convulsive seizures of 39% compared with 13% for a placebo, which GW said was highly statistically significant. The company\u2019s chief executive Justin Gover said: The positive outcome of this Phase 3 trial is a significant milestone in the development of Epidiolex as a potential new treatment for patients suffering from Dravet syndrome. We are excited about the potential for Epidiolex to become the first [US Food and Drug Administration] approved treatment option specifically for Dravet syndrome patients and their families. The study is the first of four epilepsy trials, and GW now plans to ask for a meeting with the FDA to discuss its plans to seek regulatory approval for the treatment. GW was founded in 1998 to explore the medical benefits of cannabis, and its multiply sclerosis treatment Sativex now has approval in more than 20 countries, although not in the US. The company has a UK government licence to grow cannabis plants for medical use. News of the successful Epidiolex trial has pushed its shares up 123% to 481.75p.",

      "bodyText": "Goals Soccer Centres is following in the footsteps of Stephen Gerrard and Frank Lampard and pinning its hopes on the US as its UK performance runs out of steam. The 5-a-side specialist has reported its first annual pretax loss in 12 years, dropping into the red to the tune of \u00a36.2m after a \u00a36.8m profit in the previous year. The 2014 figures were boosted by the enthusiasm generated by the World Cup, but since then the business has faced growing competition, and has also taken a \u00a314.5m impairment charge, including a write-off of \u00a38.2m on underperforming centres. It has appointed a new chairman in Nick Basing, to replace Keith Edelman, but its still searching for a chief executive. It plans to curtail its openings in the UK but hopes to add four more sites to its one centre in the US. Managing director Keith Rogers - who will now spearhead the US operation - said: We have built a strong football brand and have pioneered the game in the UK. However, we are not blind to the challenges we face in a fast evolving market. The development of full size artificial pitches on school and local authority sites has fuelled increasing competition to our league offering and players now have more choice on where to play their game. This has impacted our business significantly recently. Like for like sales fell 6.7%, with the decline accelerating in the second half to 11.5%. But the first nine weeks of the current year have seen modest positive like for like sales. On the US Rogers said: Our confidence in and enthusiasm for the US market continues to grow. We have made significant progress on our US site pipeline, with one site having completed legals and all necessary consents and another four sites at an advanced stage. A strategic review is due by May\u2019s annual meeting, and could be accompanied by a fundraising, analysts believe. At N+1 Singer, Sahill Shan said: 2015 finals are broadly in line with our significantly reduced expectations and as feared, contain an asset impairment exercise. Judging by the tenor of the results the new executive chairman and new chief executive (still to be finalised) have an enormous challenge to revive a flagging UK business. This is evidenced by a clear admission that the UK business is under-invested and with much increased competition. Given a stretched balance sheet, we would not rule out another equity raise to back the new management\u2019s strategic review, which we understand is likely to be unveiled at the annual meeting stage on 5 May. Current trading would suggest a degree of like for like stability rather than a good recovery. We are unlikely to make any material forecast changes post today\u2019s finals and maintain a buy in the belief that the new team can unlock shareholder value. Canaccord Genuity said: There\u2019s no denying that 2015 was a disappointment as the promise from the hard work of 2014 melted away in the second half of 2015. A New Year brings a new season where like for like sales are fractionally up, a new executive chairman, a board that is changing and a renewed focus on cash generation. UK roll-out has stopped and the dividend has been cancelled but the US plans remain intact. We have trimmed our earnings per share forecasts by -1.8% to 11.4p for 2016 and by -9.6% to 12.2p for 2017. We retain our hold recommendation and nudge down our target price to 135p (was 140p) to reflect the forecast changes. Mr Basing\u2019s appointment to the post of executive chairman and the relocation of Mr Rogers to spearhead the US development brings fresh vigour to the group and a stronger focus on the US. Mr Basing expects to complete his strategic review of the business by May\u2019s annual meeting which will be an important date for shareholders. The reality is that the results of the US initiative will drive the share price in the longer term, in the shorter term, the need to turn around the UK operations is key. Goals\u2019 shares are currently down 1.7% at 114.5p.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the bank that almost bankrupted Ireland has been granted bail under strict conditions including the surrender of his passport and having to report to police twice a day. David Drumm appeared in Dublin district court on Monday morning to face 33 charges relating to the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank. Drumm fought a four-month battle against extradition from the US to Ireland. He dropped his legal challenge against extradition in February. Within hours of Drumm arriving back in Dublin from Boston, the 49-year-old former chief executive of the bank was formally charged at Ballymun Garda station in the north of the city. Drumm was accused of forgery and false accounting for loans in 2008 designed to rescue Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s share price. The Dublin-born banker denies any wrongdoing. The charges carry prison sentences ranging from five years to an unlimited term. In 2009 Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised, with the Irish taxpayer having to pay \u20ac30bn (\u00a323bn) to rescue a financial institution that was once the preferred bank of builders and property speculators. During the hearing, which began at 11am on Monday, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na said they opposed bail due to, they said, Drumm being a flight risk and due to the seriousness of the charges and potential penalties. But court judge Michael Walsh agreed to bail once Drumm surrendered his Irish passport and gave assurances he did not possess a US one. He was also ordered to sign on twice a day in Balbriggan Garda station in north county Dublin. The judge instructed Drumm to offer up two independent sureties of \u20ac50,000 each; \u20ac25,000 must be lodged in cash and the other \u20ac25,000 must be shown in a bank account. After the bank bailout Drumm left Ireland for the US and refused repeated requests to come home and be questioned over the bank\u2019s affairs. During the extradition hearing Drumm was moved from his home in an upmarket area of Boston to the Plymouth county correctional centre which his lawyers described as \u201cunrelentingly harsh\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable\u201d. After the rescue of Anglo Irish Bank, it was nationalised and renamed the Irish Banking Resolution Corporation. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic boom, when it became the major financier for over-stretched Irish developers and investors playing the global property market, caused national outrage in Ireland.",

Up to 40 jobs are set to go at the site, part of the Capita subsidiary whose services range from administering pension schemes to collecting the TV licence. A spokesman said the move was a one-off, adding: \u201cWe have reviewed our current resource requirements and are undergoing a small restructure to make the business more efficient and to more closely align it with the needs of our clients.\u201d Final numbers for the cuts have yet to be confirmed, but it will be less than 1% of the 4,500 workforce. Separately there are also reports that Phil Cusack, the chairman of Greater Manchester chamber of commerce, lost his job as north west business development director at Capita. The news comes after last month\u2019s disappointing full year results from the company which sent its shares to a two year low. The company reported a fall in pretax profits from \u00a3292.4m to \u00a3112.1m after larger than expected impairment charges and the costs of abandoning lower growth businesses. Its pipeline of bids dropped from \u00a35.1bn to \u00a34.7bn, while it predicted organic revenue growth of at least 4% in 2016, down from 4.3% last year. Alongside the results, it also announced the departure of its chairman Martin Bolland. In a sell note on the business, Michael Donnelly at Panmure Gordon said: \u201cThe impairment is probably not as large as we had feared, but the risk now is that further impairments in other divisions will further occlude what is already an increasingly incomprehensible set of accounts. \u201cCapita\u2019s exit from weaker businesses has clearly driven a marginal improvement in metrics, but falling cash generation and conversion should remain a concern for investors as the portfolio is further rebalanced.\u201d More generally, a recent Guardian survey showed that more than one in three public-private partnership deals signed with outsourcing companies had come back in house once the contract came to an end. Capita shares are currently up 3p at \u00a310.40.",

      "bodyText": "Unlike other European markets, UK shares slipped back last week but have at least started the new trading session on a positive note. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: While European and US markets managed to book their fourth successive week of gains they still remain in negative territory for the year, though the FTSE 100 did slip back slightly last week, largely as a result of weak performances from the mining, oil and gas and banking sectors which all posed negative weeks, and weighed overall. This week looks set to get off to a positive start due to Asia markets following on from the positive end to last week, as we look ahead to another week of headline risk from data and central banks. The Bank of Japan meets over the next two days, while the US Federal Reserve will unveil its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday, the same day as the UK budget. The day after comes the Bank of England announcement. China\u2019s central bank could also be in the spotlight. Weak retail sales and industrial production figures from the world\u2019s second largest economy over the weekend prompted speculation the bank might be prepared to provide more stimulus to boost the flagging economy. This thought has helped mining shares, with Glencore up 6.3p to 148p, Anglo American adding 19.6p to 535.2p and BHP Billiton 19.8p better at 835.6p. So overall the FTSE 100 is currently 32.91 points higher at 6172.70. ITV has climbed 3.5p to 237.9p following a report in the Sunday Times that Channel 4 could be privatised. That could help ITV if it leads to the introduction of retransmission charges, said Liberum. In a buy note analyst Ian Whittaker said: The Culture Secretary yesterday indicated he was in favour of privatising Channel 4. We see this as increasing the chances of the introduction of retransmission fees for the main public service broadcasting channels, which would be a boost to both ITV\u2019s earnings and rating. If ITV could charge \u00a31 per month per pay-tv subscriber for ITV1, we estimate this would boost full year revenues (and adjusted pretax profit, as it would be 100% margin enhancing) by \u00a3145m, or a 12% boost to our current 2017 estimated ITV forecasts (we currently do not assume any retransmission revenues for ITV1 in forecasts). It should also \u2013 as it did for the US broadcasters \u2013 lead to a re-rating of the shares. Morgan Stanley was also positive on the broadcaster: ITV looks cheap against peers and the advertising outlook may be better than the April number suggests. But Liberum\u2019s Whittaker repeated his sell rating on Pearson, up 0.5p to 872.5p, after comments from a US book business. He said: Barnes and Noble Education, a major US college bookstore business reported third quarter numbers last week and indicated it was seeing a number of structural headwinds in the sales of textbooks and materials in the US higher education market: \u201cAs we look at sales for the quarter by merchandise category, our textbook sales declined 5.4% on a comparable basis, primarily due to the later Rush period and decreased enrollments in community colleges. Aggressive online marketplace pricing, digital direct courseware sales, OER (Open Education Resources) content, along with students\u2019 reluctance to purchase textbooks, is providing some headwinds for course material sales. In order to combat these headwinds, we have successfully piloted our textbook price-matching program on multiple campuses this fall, and again during the Spring Rush.\u201d This seems at odds with Pearson\u2019s comments about \u201ccyclical/policy\u201d factors being the main reason for the problems it faces in its US higher education side, which we estimate is at least one-third of group profits. Insurer Admiral has fallen 41p to \u00a318.74 after a good recent run as HSBC moved from buy to hold, while the same bank reduced its rating on transport group Stagecoach, down 13.6p to 259.8p, from hold to reduce. Aviva is down 6.4p at 489p as RBC issued an underperform rating, although it raised its target price from 460p to 480p.",

In a report that singled out \u201cwealthy British tax-dodgers\u201d for withholding funds that could be used to fight poverty, the charity called for a crackdown on tax havens. It said that the total net wealth of people in the UK had increased from \u00a36tn in 2000 to \u00a310tn in 2015, based on figures from Swiss bank Credit Suisse. But while just 7p in every pound of wealth created went to the 30 million people who make up the nation\u2019s poorest 50%, around 26p went to the richest 1%. The 1%, which comprises 600,000 people, increased their collective wealth by 79% to \u00a32.4tn, or an average of \u00a33.7m each, over the 15-year period. During the same timeframe, the average wealth of someone in the bottom 10%, including debt, rose to \u00a31,600 compared to \u00a31,100, a far more modest 45% rise. Oxfam said the growth in wealth should be spread more evenly, pointing to figures showing that more people than ever before rely on food banks to feed themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not right that a tiny group of individuals hoovers up so much of the UK\u2019s growing prosperity while barely any trickles down to those who have least,\u201d said Mark Goldring, Oxfam chief executive. \u201cWe need action to ensure that a rise in wealth is more evenly shared in order to combat poverty and ensure everyone gets a fair share.\u201d In a report titled End the Era of Tax Havens, Oxfam said wealthy people funnelling cash to \u201csecrecy jurisdictions\u201d such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda were contributing to the wealth divide. It said the Treasury was losing around \u00a35bn a year from British \u201ctax-dodgers\u201d holding more than \u00a3170bn in tax havens. It also highlighted the impact on the global wealth gap, saying governments are thought to be losing \u00a3120bn, with the world\u2019s poorest regions missing out on \u00a343bn. Oxfam also called on the UK chancellor George Osborne to use this Wednesday\u2019s budget to clamp down on corporate tax-dodging, by requiring UK companies to publish country-by-country data on profits and tax contribution.",

The bulk of the decline was down to a fall-off in visits to the high street, which were 2.9% lower than the same month in 2015. Shopping centres also welcomed fewer visitors, down 0.6%, but retail parks reported an increase of 2.5%, partly as a result of additional attractions such as restaurants and entertainment. Overall, every area of the country except Greater London and the south-west experienced a downturn in the number of shoppers coming through retailers\u2019 doors. Diana Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said the disproportionately large fall in high street shopping traffic was down to \u201cthe tough retail trading environment\u201d, which has led to shops competing on price to capture customers\u2019 disposable income. She said the simultaneous increase seen in retail parks, which tend to feature larger, warehouse-style outlets, reflected demand for furniture and household goods. She also identified a shift towards shopping in the evening, with customer footfall in February showing a 0.2% increase in the evening, compared with a 3.9% fall during daytime hours. Retail parks were able to poach customers from the high street, she said, by \u201cproviding the right environments and price points to make out-of-home dining and socialising easy, attractive and affordable\u201d. Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, said government policies such as the national living wage and the introduction of an apprenticeship levy were adding to retailers\u2019 costs. She called on the chancellor to use Wednesday\u2019s budget to \u201crecognise both the burdens facing retailers as well as our importance to the UK\u2019s economy and communities\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government will be putting retail jobs at risk if it does not undertake a fundamental review of business rates, Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, has warned ahead of the budget on Wednesday. In a clear warning to the chancellor, George Osborne, Lewis said business rates were \u201ccompletely disproportionate\u201d and the fact they are linked solely to property puts traditional retailers operating from physical stores at a disadvantage. Lewis also threw his weight behind a report by the British Retail Consortium that said there could be 900,000 fewer jobs in retail by 2025 as costs including business rates and the national minimum wage rise. Lewis said the BRC report was a \u201cfair reflection\u201d of the outlook for the retail sector, which is a major employer in the UK. \u201cIf the government is not careful, it is going to keep piling on the burden. Business rates are the single biggest tax Tesco pays \u2013 \u00a3700m a year.\u201d Last year, Lewis said retailers face a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d as profits slump and costs rise. Retailers face \u00a314bn of extra costs in the next five years from an increase in business rates and Osborne\u2019s introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d in 2016, he said. \u201cThere is a real risk that [this] will put pressure on employment in traditional retail,\u201d he added. Last month, leaked documents revealed that Tesco is considering cutting store staff by 39,000 over the next three years as the supermarket group tries to reverse a decline in profits. The group, which employs more than 300,000 people in the UK, cut thousands of jobs last year as part of efforts to reduce costs, although Lewis said there were no current plans to go further. But he added: \u201cWe have to keep that under review depending on what happens in the budget [and the wider market].\u201d His focus on business rates was echoed by the British Chambers of Commerce. Its acting director general, Adam Marshall, said: \u201cMinisters must also finally take action to ease the burden of business rates. Reform of the rates system is long overdue and a source of uncertainty for companies everywhere\u201d. Marshall has been propelled into the role since the departure of John Longworth after he was suspended for expressing his support for a UK exit from the European Union. \u201cIn an increasingly uncertain economic environment, the chancellor should avoid any and all moves that could damage business confidence. At a time when many businesses already face sharply higher costs and taxes, the chancellor must avoid adding any new obligations on our firms,\u201d Marshall said. Osborne launched a review into business rates, which are based on commercial properly values, last year, and since then has promised to give local authorities control over business rates by 2020. Tesco reported better than expected trading over Christmas and recent market data suggests that Lewis has dramatically slowed the pace of sales falls in recent months. Lewis said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased with progress, but I\u2019m absolutely sure there is much more that we need to do.\u201d He said he expected the grocery market to remain tough in 2016. \u201cNot since the early 1970s has the UK market experienced any food deflation and we are now entering a third year of that. Nothing I see suggests that is going to change in the next year or so ... Deflationary prices are good for customers but challenging for a business like ours and pressures from business rates and the living wages and new competitors.\u201d Tesco had \u201can opportunity to manage those conditions better than others,\u201d Lewis said. One area of focus is Tesco Mobile, the group\u2019s telecommunications business, which is currently run as a 50-50 joint venture with O2. O2 is in the process of being taken over by Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network in the UK. Tesco has signalled to European regulators, who are currently considering the deal, that it is looking at taking full ownership of the venture and securing capacity on Hutchison\u2019s networks. Lewis said Tesco would \u201clook at all options\u201d to protect its position in Tesco Mobile. \u201cIt is a very good business that is extremely well managed and customers love it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the regulator looks at it, we need to make sure we protect the value in what is a great business for us.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Millions of UK holidaymakers and business travellers face higher air fares and fewer scheduled flights between the UK and the European Union if the UK votes to leave the 28-member bloc in the June referendum,, an industry trade body has warned. Consumer protections, including free health cover through the European Health Insurance Card and financial protection for package holidays are also at risk, according to the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta). Abta also fears that in the short term, the \u201cprolonged uncertainty\u201d could weaken the pound against other currencies, reducing spending power overseas. Abta has around 1,200 members \u2013 from airlines to tour operators to travel agents \u2013 with a combined UK turnover of \u00a332bn. More than 29m foreign holidays each year are made by UK holidaymakers to EU countries, around 76% of all holidays taken. In addition, 68% of all business trips from the UK are to EU countries \u2013 the equivalent of 4.6m business visits Abta\u2019sreport uses economic analysis by professional services firm Deloitte to explore the impact on travel businesses and consumers. \u201cOur assessment of the report\u2019s findings is that a vote to leave will lead to uncertainties and may lead to increased costs for travel businesses and the travelling public,\u201d said Mark Tanzer, chief executive of Abta. \u201cWe recognise that people will approach this referendum by considering many factors \u2013 personal, professional, and economic \u2013 before casting their vote. Abta has considered what a vote to leave the EU might mean purely from a travel perspective. Our view is that the potential risks and downsides are not matched by an equal upside for the traveller,\u201d said Tanzer. Abta warned that while many EU regulations designed to benefit holidaymakers and business travellers would not change immediately following Brexit, they were at risk in the future. These include financial protection for package holidays, compensation for flight delays, access to free health cover through the European Health Insurance Card, caps on mobile phone charges and \u201copen skies\u201d across the EU, which have led to more routes, more airlines, and lower fares. Of immediate concern is the impact that a period of prolonged uncertainty will have on the strength of the pound versus other currencies, the report said: \u201cA weaker pound has a direct impact on spending power overseas, making the cost of holidaying or visiting abroad more expensive, as well as adding costs for UK businesses to buy abroad.\u201d Andrew Swaffield, chief executive of the budget airline Monarch, said the emergence of low-cost airlines has increased competition and helped to cut prices for consumers. \u201cIf the UK were to exit the EU, Monarch would view the outcomes for the travel sector as very negative, not least because of the uncertainty that would follow in the aftermath,\u201d Swaffield said. \u201cAn exit would most likely lead to higher air fares and fewer scheduled flights between the EU and the UK.\u201d Swaffield \u2013 along with Tui\u2019s Fritz Joussen and Virgin Atlantic founder Richard Branson \u2013 has already spoken out against Brexit. Meanwhile, last month Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet suggested a Brexit could herald a return to the days when flying was \u201creserved for the elite\u201d while Peter Long, former boss of the Tui travel group, said close cooperation with other EU states was essential to \u201cprotect the security of our holidaymakers\u201d. There have been some alternative views. Joel Brandon-Bravo of travel deal website Travelzoo has said that travel patterns might not alter much in the months following Brexit or that EU nations would add visa restrictions or significant costs to travel.",

These include financial protection for package holidays, compensation for flight delays, access to free health cover through the European Health Insurance Card, caps on mobile phone charges and \u201copen skies\u201d across the EU, which have led to more routes, more airlines, and lower fares.<br></p> <p>Of immediate concern is the impact that a period of prolonged uncertainty will have on the strength of the pound versus other currencies, the report said: \u201cA weaker pound has a direct impact on spending power overseas, making the cost of holidaying or visiting abroad more expensive, as well as adding costs for UK businesses to buy abroad.\u201d<br></p> <p>Andrew Swaffield, chief executive of the budget airline<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/07/troubled-monarch-airways-returns-profit\"> Monarch</a>, said the emergence of low-cost airlines has increased competition and helped to cut prices for consumers. </p> <p> \u201cIf the UK were to exit the EU, Monarch would view the outcomes for the travel sector as very negative, not least because of the uncertainty that would follow in the aftermath,\u201d Swaffield said. </p> <p>\u201cAn exit would most likely lead to higher air fares and fewer scheduled flights between the EU and the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Swaffield \u2013 along with Tui\u2019s Fritz Joussen and Virgin Atlantic founder Richard Branson \u2013 has already spoken out against Brexit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/carolyn-mccall\">Carolyn McCall</a>, chief executive of easyJet<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/14/brexit-could-risk-tourists-safety-and-push-up-flight-prices-say-top-travel-figures\"> suggested a Brexit could herald a return to the days when flying was \u201creserved for the elite\u201d</a> while Peter Long, former boss of the Tui travel group, said close cooperation with other EU states was essential to \u201cprotect the security of our holidaymakers\u201d. </p> <p>There have been some alternative views. Joel Brandon-Bravo of travel deal website Travelzoo has said that travel patterns might not alter much in the months following Brexit or that EU nations would add visa restrictions or significant costs to travel.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A body set up to defuse rows between major companies and their City investors has been involved in nine situations since it was established in October 2014, it has announced. The Investor Forum, born out of the 2012 review by John Kay into long-term investing, said it had been involved in behind-the-scenes talks on issues including succession planning, corporate governance and strategy. Simon Fraser, the chairman of the Investor Forum, would not identify the disagreements or confirm any involvement in the situation at Sports Direct, which has recently fallen out of the FTSE 100 amid revelations by the Guardian about working conditions at the sports retailer. Fraser, a former chief investment officer at Fidelity, said the forum had secured the backing of 19 fund managers for the next three years. The body facilitates talks between groups of major City shareholders and the companies in which they hold stakes. It has been operating with the support of the Investment Association, but now intends to become independent. Lady Neville-Rolfe, a minister at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, said: \u201cThe forum plays a valuable role in bringing investors together to support and challenge companies to ensure their strategies create long-term value.\u201d In the future, the Investor Forum may publish an annual report that could provide more information about its interactions between companies and shareholders. James Anderson, a partner at Baillie Gifford, said the forum \u201cenables serious dialogue with major companies away from the noise of market trading and offers the opportunity to reverse the fragmentation and diminution of our influence and responsibilities as owners that has so marred recent history\u201d. Asked about the situation at advertising company WPP, where the chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, is poised to receive a \u00a360m share bonus, Fraser said that as an example, the Investor Forum was unlikely to be asked to focus on a situation as specific as pay.",
