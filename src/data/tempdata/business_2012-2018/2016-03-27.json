      "bodyText": "Buying a train ticket in Britain can be a trying experience. Getting the best price available for a journey by rail, while faced with lengthy queues to see a sales clerk, can test the most robust patience. In the coming months, commuters on Greater Anglia will be offered a new service that aims to simplify the rail journey and charge users the best price, avoiding rail travel\u2019s often-byzantine fares. MultiPass is an app that finds the best fare for the day or week, depending on how the user has travelled previously. Commuters have to check in on the app after arriving at a train station. The app then works as a virtual pass, recording journeys, with data used to work out best fare. A trial involving 100 people last year is now being extended to a full operating system from May in a bid to replace paper tickets. Alexander Peschkoff, one of three co-founders, said there was a frustrating complexity about the type of tickets bought from a machine in a train station \u2013 from understanding what time is considered peak or off-peak to being unable to change the ticket once you have bought it. \u201cThe idea was to recreate something similar to the ticket office experience where you go in to the ticket office and you say \u2018I am going to Manchester\u2019 [and they say] \u2018when are you coming back? Tomorrow? Here is your ticket.\u2019 Done,\u201d he said. The MultiPass system works in a similar way to London\u2019s Oyster card, where the cheapest fare is calculated for all journeys taken in one day. When the user goes into a train station, a beacon registers that they are there via the app and they input their destination. A barcode ticket is issued on the phone to show an inspector. The actual price of the tickets used is only settled at the end of the week, giving the best possible price based on the single and return journeys, and also takes into account whether a weekly travel card would cut the users\u2019 bill. \u201cIf you buy a single but then your plans change and you have to go back then you have to buy another single,\u201d said Peschkoff. \u201cWith MultiPass, we give you a virtual ticket, a soft ticket. It is stored in the cloud and it is only settled at the end of the week. If you travel more during the week, we will cancel the original ticket and we will replace it with a more suited and better version of the ticket. \u201cIf you wake up on a Monday morning and decide to go to Cambridge and buy a single, with MultiPass you always buy a single, you get a soft single ticket, you go to Cambridge and then you come back. We say we have already charged you \u00a319.90 for a single but the return is \u00a324 so we will only charge you the price of the return,\u201d Peschkoff explains. If the customers travel to Cambridge and back each day, then by Thursday they will have accumulated four return tickets in the cloud. So MultiPass will cancel them all and replace them with a cheaper seven-day season ticket. \u201cThen we tell you that you can travel on Friday, Saturday, Sunday for free because you have bought the ticket,\u201d Peschkoff adds. This may allow users to take advantage of tickets that they may not have been aware of, according to Peschkoff, who said three-quarters of people bought their tickets at the station. Many travellers were unaware, he said, that return tickets were valid for 30 days after they were bought. The majority of people who would benefit from buying a weekly ticket are not buying them because of the expense. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise this,\u201d he said. An initial trial was held at 24 stations between London Liverpool Street and Cambridge with 100 customers. The Greater Anglia rail network, operated by Abellio, will be fitted with beacons by May and the MultiPass system will then be rolled out, route by route. The first routes to go live will be London-Cambridge, followed by lines to Southend and Norwich. All routes will be completed by the end of the year, said Peschkoff. Another pilot scheme is planned for the north of England, most likely between Sheffield, Doncaster and York. MultiPass\u2019s goal is to become a nationwide system of ticketing, eventually being used on contactless payment cards in the same manner as has been adopted by London Underground. Navigating the complex grid that is the British rail network \u2013 and its 24 operators \u2013 is an enormous challenge, however, with the only slight relief being that some companies run multiple rail franchises. \u201cIt is rocket science,\u201d said Peschkoff. There has been some resistance from operators that benefit from customers buying tickets at a higher price, he said, and there is a complex bureaucracy of winning multiple approvals and permissions through every operator. The company makes money by taking a commission from the operators on the tickets that are sold, while the consumer does not pay any more for their journeys. So far, \u00a32m has been invested in the company and it has received \u00a31.1m from Innovate UK, the government agency that supports funding research and technology development. It has also developed a secure wearable device. Peschkoff said tackling the UK\u2019s complex rail and ticketing system would give them a better footing for international expansion. \u201cOnce we have cracked the UK, the rest is plain sailing.\u201d You can read our archive of Innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website, where you will find more information on how the centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and elsewhere.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have something in common. Both are hostile to the free trade deals that Barack Obama has been negotiating, and both have been campaigning on a platform of putting American workers first. One thing is certain: if either of these two political insurgents makes it to the White House, there will be no great rush to provide easier access to the world\u2019s biggest market. The agreement that Obama has been seeking with the European Union, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), will be dead in the water. Hillary Clinton has been more supportive of trade deals in the past but has grown noticeably less enthusiastic as it has become clear that the tougher line adopted by Sanders resonates with many Democrats. Trade has turned into a political issue in the US. Presidential hopefuls are expected to have a view on the transpacific partnership, imposing sanctions on China for currency manipulation and whether the US should have signed the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada in the early 1990s. The same applies in the UK, where the Brexit debate has forced both sides to develop an instant expertise in the different sort of trade regimes that exist between the EU and the rest of the world. There are intense debates about the merits \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 of the Norwegian model, the Swiss model and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) model, and detailed forecasts about the economic costs and benefits of each. An early sign that trade policy was no longer merely the preserve of political nerds came with the groundswell of opposition in Europe to TTIP. This was billed originally as something largely apolitical: an attempt to harmonise rules and regulations in the US and the EU so there were fewer barriers to trade. Yet the TTIP is deeply contentious. Opponents say \u201charmonisation\u201d is not some boring, technocratic exercise, but rather a race to the bottom that will dilute quality controls and safety standards. But it has been the idea of an investor state dispute settlement (ISDS) system, under which corporations could challenge decisions made by governments, that has proven particularly toxic. It was not that long ago that freer trade was thought to be a good thing. The WTO was set up at the end of the Uruguay round of trade liberalisation talks, which ended in late 1993. At that point, it was assumed that there would soon be further global agreements to cover unfinished business in areas such as agriculture and services. Few imagined that it would take until 2001 to begin another round of talks and that these would drag on for 14 years before being abandoned. The assumption in the early 1990s was that the world was entering a new era of globalisation, to match that of the late 19th century, in which there would be free movement of capital, people and goods. The first world war put paid to what has been dubbed one era of globalisation. Brexit, rows over TTIP, Europe\u2019s attempts to halt the flow of migrants and the \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach adopted by Trump and Sanders all send out the same message: the retreat is underway from another period of globalisation. This process has had a number of phases. It was always obvious that there would be winners and losers from globalisation, since it involved companies moving production from high cost to low-cost parts of the world. Factories in the west closed, but consumers benefited from cheaper goods. Initially, the winners easily outnumbered the losers, although the losses suffered by the losers were bigger than the gains for the winners. But the last period of globalisation was a lot more fragile than it looked. It was built on the availability of easy credit, as became painfully apparent in 2007, when the financial markets froze up and trade collapsed on a scale not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. There has been no return to pre-crisis days. Recovery has been much more modest than in previous economic cycles and world trade is barely growing. Unemployment has remained high in the eurozone and even in those developed countries where it has come down \u2013 the US and the UK \u2013 wages have remained under pressure. The recession and its aftermath have meant an increase in the number of people who think that the economic system may be working for the owners of multinational corporations and the global super rich, but is not working for them. The sense of unhappiness has been fanned by two other factors. First, the recovery has been skewed in favour of the haves rather than the have nots, largely because while earnings have been depressed, asset prices have been going up fast. Second, the traditional parties of the centre appear to have nothing to offer other than a return to the debt-sodden, finance-driven world that led to the crisis in the first place. As in the retreat from the globalisation era that ended the first world war, voters are turning their backs on mainstream politicians and looking instead to those that can articulate their sense of being ignored or left behind. Hence the support for Trump, Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn, and Marine Le Pen in France, all of whom come from outside the mainstream. Politics is grappling with what the economist Dani Rodrik has called an \u201cinescapable trilemma\u201d: the ability to have any two of democracy, global integration and the nation state, but not all three simultaneously. One solution, according to Rodrik, would be global federalism, an attempt to align the scope of politics to that of global markets. The EU could be considered an attempt to test out the viability of this approach. Europe\u2019s current difficulties suggest that a global polity remains some way off. Another answer, he suggests, would be to put global economic integration ahead of domestic objectives. This would mean a return to the pre-1914 world of the gold standard, unfettered capital flows and unchecked migration. Incompatible with mass democracy and the growth of welfare states, it risks intensifying the backlash against globalisation. Finally, Rodrik says there could be a recognition that there can only be so much global integration, with controls on the free movement of capital, people and goods. This was pretty much the settlement that was brokered after the second world war, but unpicked from the mid-1970s onwards. If history is any guide, this process has further to run. It took more than three decades, which included two world wars and the Great Depression, for a new economic order to emerge. Efforts to turn the clock back failed, old solutions to economic problems no longer seemed to work, banks failed, deflation set in, and free trade was replaced by protectionism and economic nationalism. This all seems worryingly familiar from the perspective of 2016.",

First, the recovery has been skewed in favour of the haves rather than the have nots, largely because while earnings have been depressed, asset prices have been going up fast. Second, the traditional parties of the centre appear to have nothing to offer other than a return to the debt-sodden, finance-driven world that led to the crisis in the first place.</p> <p>As in the retreat from the globalisation era that ended the first world war, voters are turning their backs on mainstream politicians and looking instead to those that can articulate their sense of being ignored or left behind. Hence the support for Trump, Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn, and Marine Le Pen in France, all of whom come from outside the mainstream.</p> <p>Politics is grappling with what the economist Dani Rodrik has called an <a href=\"http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/06/the-inescapable.html\">\u201cinescapable trilemma\u201d</a>: the ability to have any two of democracy, global integration and the nation state, but not all three simultaneously.</p> <p>One solution, according to Rodrik, would be global federalism, an attempt to align the scope of politics to that of global markets. The EU could be considered an attempt to test out the viability of this approach. Europe\u2019s current difficulties suggest that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Polity_Theory\">a global polity</a> remains some way off.</p> <p>Another answer, he suggests, would be to put global economic integration ahead of domestic objectives. This would mean a return to the pre-1914 world of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/03/gold-standard-no-economic-sense\">the gold standard</a>, unfettered capital flows and unchecked migration. Incompatible with mass democracy and the growth of welfare states, it risks intensifying the backlash against globalisation.</p> <p>Finally, Rodrik says there could be a recognition that there can only be so much global integration, with controls on the free movement of capital, people and goods. This was pretty much the settlement that was brokered after the second world war, but unpicked from the mid-1970s onwards.</p> <p>If history is any guide, this process has further to run. It took more than three decades, which included two world wars and the Great Depression, for a new economic order to emerge. Efforts to turn the clock back failed, old solutions to economic problems no longer seemed to work, banks failed, deflation set in, and free trade was replaced by protectionism and economic nationalism. This all seems worryingly familiar from the perspective of 2016.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Most British workers are spending longer at their workplace for little or no gain in productivity, according to a landmark study being released this week. More than two-thirds of employees say they are working longer hours than two years ago, but only 10% believe they are more productive. The study of attitudes to work by the Smith Institute, a UK thinktank, also found that more than a quarter of staff believed their productivity had declined over the period. Coming only a fortnight after the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) downgraded its forecast for productivity, the study will fuel concerns that British businesses are relying on cheap labour to work more hours in an effort to increase output. The study found that nine in 10 workers said they believed productivity was important and almost 80% said their employer measured it, at least sometimes. But they said managers usually sought productivity gains through jobs cuts or simply doing the same tasks at a faster pace. Only a minority of employees associated higher productivity with better pay and conditions. The report said: \u201cThere is a clear message that employees feel that they should receive a fair share from delivering higher productivity in pay terms, but they feel pessimistic that this will be the case.\u201d Productivity is based on a measure of the hours worked to produce a specific output. It fell in the last quarter of 2015, bringing to an end nine months of improvements, the OBR said. Without sustained improvements in the UK\u2019s output per hour worked, it said, a recovery was further away. The government has vowed to improve productivity, but its latest plan was criticised as \u201ca vague collection of existing policies\u201d by a committee of MPs. The OBR, which is the Treasury\u2019s independent economic forecaster, said before the budget that wage growth would be lower over the next five years than the 2.2% previously predicted, at an average 2%. Listening to workers would be the fastest route to higher productivity, respondents told the Smith Institute, though managers mostly ignored advice from colleagues and the shop floor. One civil servant surveyed said: \u201cIt would be better to concentrate on improving quality, not quantity \u2026 [to get work] right first time rather than continually having to repeat or rectify botched or inadequate work which meets a so-called target.\u201d An NHS radiographer warned that productivity can be hard to judge. \u201cHaving a difficult conversation with a patient is extremely important to the patient but could be deemed non-productive as it does not physically produce an outcome.\u201d More than 7,400 workers across the private and public sectors responded to the survey, which was conducted for Unions21, a mainly union-funded thinktank that aims to \u201cprovide an \u2018open space\u2019 for discussion on the future of the trade union movement and the world of work\u201d. Shop workers made up the largest proportion of respondents, but many came from the energy sector, media and communications and central government. The study, which will be presented to the Unions21 conference next week, found that 82% of workers see technology as \u201cnecessary and inevitable\u201d even though a third believe it will probably make their current role redundant. Official figures show that productivity has barely increased since 2006 and that the UK has the lowest rate of growth in the G7. Some academics believe the current measure of productivity is outdated and misses huge advances in the technology sector. Others argue that the UK\u2019s reduced reliance on the highly productive financial sector, which generates a high income from relatively few inputs, and shift to service industries that rely on large numbers of low paid workers, has reduced average productivity.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Boardroom pay will soon be back in the spotlight as this year\u2019s annual general meeting season gets under way in the City. Major investors are also on alert for companies handing out overly generous pension arrangements to their senior executives, having too few women at the boardroom table and not having succession plans in place for their bosses. Shareholders \u2013 some of whom control multimillion-pound stakes and others who own just a couple of shares \u2013 get a chance to voice their views in public at the AGMs of many major companies listed on the stock market which will take place in the coming three months. They can be hostile events for the full-time directors and part-time non-executives, not only because investors can ask questions from the floor but also because they vote on a series of resolutions, including the traditionally contentious issue of executive pay. \u201cThe first area that comes up at the AGM season, and what we are watching particularly carefully this year, is remuneration,\u201d said Bruce Duguid of Hermes Investment Management. In 2014, companies put their pay policies to the vote for the first time. These polices set out the approach to executive pay for the coming three years so 2016 is the last year they are in place. Some companies may now be trying to increase the salaries of their boardroom executives before putting their three-year policies to the vote again next year. \u201cThis is the time to attempt to look at higher quantum,\u201d said Duguid. Each year investors are also given a vote on the remuneration report covering that year\u2019s pay \u2013 and this year pension payouts to top executives are on shareholders\u2019 agenda. The advisory body Pirc, or the Pensions and Investment Research Consultants, is also seeking proper explanations from companies for the use of share buybacks to ensure that these are not being used to prop up pay deals for company bosses by artificially improving shareholder returns. The scale of pay deals on offer is illustrated by Sir Martin Sorrell \u2013 the founder and chief executive of WPP \u2013 who stands to receive almost \u00a370m for 2015. Succession planning is being closely watched too. GlaxoSmithKline, HSBC and Schroders are among companies that have announced changes at the top. The pharmaceutical company GSK said its chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, would go next year while the banking group HSBC is preparing for the departure of its chairman Douglas Flint and, it has signalled, the chief executive Stuart Gulliver too. The asset manager Schroders is flouting corporate governance codes by elevating its chief executive, Michael Dobson, to the chairman\u2019s seat. Oliver Parry, senior corporate governance adviser of the Institute of Directors, contrasted Schroders and HSBC which, he said, was planning a year in advance. \u201cThey are doing a very good job,\u201d he said. The aim is to avoid the cost of luring chief executives from rival firms, as recently highlighted by the oil and gas firm BG. It hired CEO Helge Lund on a multimilllion-pound scheme just months before being sold to the oil company Shell, and details of Lund\u2019s final pay deal are awaited by BG shareholders. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London Asset Management, said companies could be risking rows if pension payments were excessive. \u201cWe do not think executives should receive preferential treatment with regards to pension payments. Companies should strive to achieve pension fairness for all staff, regardless of seniority. Lloyds Banking Group stands out as a laggard on this issue offering a pension benefit of 50% of base salary to the CEO,\u201d she said. In a comment piece for the Guardian, she said: \u201cThere is no clear cut model for success, but we strongly believe that across the [banking] sector, more must be done to ensure that executives are remunerated appropriately for the value they deliver to shareholders. This means sharing the pain as well as the gain.\u201d Duguid of Hermes is also preparing to protest at companies that have failed to reach the target set in 2011 by Lord Davies for 25% of the seats to be held by women by now. A new target for 33% female representation in the boardroom has been set for 2020. \u201cIf a company hasn\u2019t reached the [25%] target and has no plans to do so over the next period to 2020, and has no explanation for why, we will consider voting against,\u201d said Duguid. The \u201cshareholder spring\u201d of 2012 \u2013 when record numbers of pay deals faced rebellions \u2013 is still fresh in many executives\u2019 minds. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of the advisory agency Manifest, said: \u201cAre we going to get a repeat of the shareholder spring? I don\u2019t think so. But we could see some of the underperforming companies taken to task.\u201d Potential flash points Persimmon 14 April The house builder\u2019s long-term bonus scheme is based on generating returns to shareholders, which Manifest said are \u201cunder the direct control of the company and there is a potential threat that unsustainable shareholder returns could be made at the expense of longer term investment in company assets\u201d. Defending the scheme, Persimmon said it had been approved in 2012 and extends beyond the boardroom to 150 executives. BP 14 April A near-$20m pay deal for Bob Dudley, fuelled by a $6.5m increase in his pension contribution. The company points out Dudley has a US pension scheme which is inflated under UK rules. Schroders 28 April The elevation of the chief executive, Michael Dobson, to chairman. The fund manager has issued a letter to its investors setting out that Dobson is the outstanding candidate for the role. Barclays 28 April It has warned of a dividend cut in 2016 and 2017, and in 2015 paid out \u00a3500m more in bonuses than in dividends to shareholders. The chief executive, Jes Staley, has said the \u201chard\u201d decision on the dividend was needed to bolster shareholder returns in the years ahead. Lloyds Banking Group 12 May A pension contribution of 50% of salary for the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio \u2013 an arrangement that has been in place since he was hired six years ago \u2013 may be criticised.",

Sarah Wilson, chief executive of the advisory agency Manifest, said: \u201cAre we going to get a repeat of the shareholder spring? I don\u2019t think so.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The political crisis in Brazil over economic mismanagement and high-level corruption, likely to come to a head next week, has reinforced the fashionable view, popular among western governments and businesses, that the Brics bubble has burst. Members of the exclusive Brics club of leading developing countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 are failing to justify predictions that, separately and together, they will dominate the 21st century world, or so the argument goes. The Brics concept, plus acronym, was dreamed up in 2001 by Jim O\u2019Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. He highlighted the combined potential of non-western powers controlling one quarter of the world\u2019s land mass and accounting for more than 40% of its population. O\u2019Neill\u2019s idea morphed into a formal association, with South Africa joining the original Bric group in 2011. The five nations, with a joint estimated GDP of $16tn, set up their own development bank in parallel to the US-dominated IMF and World Bank and hold summits rivalling the G7 forum. Their next meeting will be in Goa, India, in October. But ambitious plans to create an alternative reserve currency to the US dollar and challenge American dominance in IT and global security surveillance have come to little. Meanwhile, adverse economic conditions compounded by falling global demand and lower oil and commodity prices are taking their toll. Last November, Goldman Sachs, where the idea originated, closed its Bric investment fund after assets reportedly declined in value by 88% from a 2010 peak. The bank told the US securities and exchange commission it did not expect \u201csignificant asset growth in the foreseeable future\u201d. \u201cThe promise of Bric\u2019s rapid and sustainable growth has been challenged very much for the last five years or so,\u201d Jorge Mariscal, the chief investment officer of emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management, told Bloomberg Business. \u201cThe Bric concept was popular. But nothing is eternal.\u201d The problems facing Brics members are remarkably similar, even though each country is different. Russia and Brazil have both fallen into recession, while China, the principal engine of world growth, has seen a sharp contraction in overall economic activity. Brazil\u2019s economic woes have been compounded by scandals that could yet force the resignation or impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, the country\u2019s president, and the trial of her predecessor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (Lula). With about a quarter of members of Brazil\u2019s congress facing some form of criminal investigation, the crisis has become structural and existential in scope, raising worries about the durability of Brazil\u2019s young democracy. Identical concerns have arisen in South Africa where Jacob Zuma, the country\u2019s president, and the ruling African National Congress government are beset by allegations of corruption and malfeasance. Big questions surround the influence wielded by private individuals and businesses over government appointments and policies. The backdrop is under-performing state-owned companies, a depreciating currency, falling exports and rising inflation. If this sounds familiar, look at Russia, where the value of the rouble has plummeted due to lower oil exports \u2013 on which the economy is unhealthily dependent. Oil revenues are said to be down about $30bn in five years. State-condoned or tolerated corruption is a big issue for Moscow, too. Cost considerations may have been a factor in the recent, surprise decision by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, to pull most of his forces out of Syria. Russia\u2019s economy also continues to suffer as a result of western sanctions imposed following Putin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea. A common factor for all Brics countries as they struggle economically is institutional weakness, in particular a lack (or in some cases, a total absence) of democratic accountability, transparency in public life, and independent media scrutiny of official behaviour. This holds especially true in China, where a fearful ruling Communist party has cracked down on public debate, labour activists, independent lawyers, and civil society organisations as economic woes triggered by falling exports and market instability have mounted. As in Brazil and Russia, the Chinese authorities\u2019 unspoken worry is spreading social unrest. This risk is increasing as Beijing seeks to restructure unprofitable state-owned industries, such as coal and steel, with the potential loss of millions of jobs. Meanwhile growth targets of 6.5-7% in the 2016-20 13th five-year plan look optimistic. Nor does the Brics group lack internal challenges. Efforts at closer political cooperation have foundered over differences about who is in charge, how best to achieve UN security council reform and, for example, territorial disputes between India and China. But not all the Brics are floundering. As the analyst George Magnus noted in Prospect magazine, India currently presents a model of relative progress which the others might study to their advantage. \u201cIndia is certainly no paragon of virtue when it comes to corruption, nor is its economic infrastructure efficient, but it is endeavouring to accelerate economic reform, and competitiveness,\u201d Magnus wrote. \u201cIndia\u2019s economy is relatively closed and so it is not as vulnerable to the slowdown in world trade; lower oil prices have unequivocally benefited the country; and inflation, interest rates, and deficits are falling. The government is trying to open up to more infrastructure spending, foreign investment and an array of improvement measures that should help the economy sustain growth rates of above 7%.\u201d Given their sheer size, their vast resources, and their youthful populations, it would plainly be foolish to write off the Brics, especially as a declining US grows more introspective and Europe\u2019s confidence falters. But economic performance cannot be the only measure of success or failure. To take their rightful place in the 21st century, the Brics countries must create more open, accountable, and trustworthy systems of governance. This is a challenge of leadership, not profit and loss.",

Stamp duty schadenfreude Buy-to-let landlords and their lawyers are two of the most dearly loved groups of people in the country. There can be no doubt about it. Their national treasure status is so assured that it is almost impossible to find anybody even remotely tempted to take a pop at them. So we all share the pain this weekend on the news that would-be landlords are rushing to complete property purchases before stamp-duty changes come into effect this week, with solicitors working over the bank holiday to make sure deals are completed in time. From Friday, anyone buying a second home for any purpose will pay a rate three percentage points higher than the standard rate, adding \u00a36,000 to the upfront cost of buying a \u00a3200,000 property.

He then needs another large gulp as the lad\u2019s pet bulldog passes wind on a saltire rug. Sophisticated advertising this may not have been, but it could be viewed as a prophetic metaphor for this week\u2019s instalment of the sugar tax row. Executives from the drink\u2019s manufacturer, AG Barr, which is unveiling results this week, will have to keep sipping on their famous brew to calm their nerves when fielding City queries about the impact of the chancellor\u2019s plans. In this allegory, AG Barr might cast itself as the angry father, with the London-based Treasury as the boyfriend \u2013 and it will surely view the emitting canine as George Osborne. Chief exec Roger White has already expressed his \u201cdisappointment\u201d that soft drinks have been singled out \u201cgiven it is the only food and drink category to have made any real progress in reducing sugar intake in recent years\u201d \u2013 and he might have a case if he claimed to be doubly unlucky.

We have been here before, when the government impose an arbitrary time limit on completing cases before a deadline.\u201d Just terrible, isn\u2019t it?</p> <h2>Irn-Bru maker braced for sugar tax</h2> <p>An old television advert for Irn-Bru showed a Scottish father taking a swig from a can of Scotland\u2019s most famous (soft) drink in order to control his temper when meeting his daughter\u2019s new, England-supporting boyfriend. He then needs another large gulp as the lad\u2019s pet bulldog passes wind on a saltire rug.</p> <p>Sophisticated advertising this may not have been, but it could be viewed as a prophetic metaphor for this week\u2019s instalment of the sugar tax row. Executives from the drink\u2019s manufacturer, AG Barr, which is unveiling results this week, will have to keep sipping on their famous brew to calm their nerves when fielding City queries about the impact of the chancellor\u2019s plans.</p> <p>In this allegory, AG Barr might cast itself as the angry father, with the London-based Treasury as the boyfriend \u2013 and it will surely view the emitting canine as George Osborne.</p> <p>Chief exec Roger White has already expressed his \u201cdisappointment\u201d that soft drinks have been singled out \u201cgiven it is the only food and drink category to have made any real progress in reducing sugar intake in recent years\u201d \u2013 and he might have a case if he claimed to be doubly unlucky.</p> <p>Unusually for the chancellor, Osborne has yet to hint at a U-turn.</p>",

His meddling in education policy and \u00a3100m support for the homeless were likewise smoke bombs thrown to divert attention from his adding another \u00a34.6bn of disability benefit cuts to the huge welfare reductions needed to create a budget surplus in 2020. The business community supports his mission and backs almost without question the \u00a312bn of welfare cuts, pay restraint in the public sector and generous tax breaks for the better-off that allow Osborne to make up the numbers. It cares little that the \u00a34.6bn of personal independent payment cuts were abandoned. It knows there is plenty of time to find an alternative. Yet the budget wasn\u2019t all good for those sitting in boardrooms. In fact business leaders, if they stopped fawning over the Tory leadership for a moment, should recognise the lack of strategic thinking and constant tinkering to achieve artificial targets as a reason to be more combative. Muted, often private, criticism is the order of the day because Osborne is supposed to be business\u2019s champion. And in some respects he is. Who else would take another slice out of corporation tax, cutting it from 20% to 17% by 2020? The chancellor is also chief tactician in the pro-EU camp, which has the overwhelming backing of business leaders. And the Treasury says it will forgo billions of pounds of business rates from small firms over the parliament, which will mean many of them paying no business rates at all. Abandoning plans to increase fuel duty \u2013 especially a rise in the tax on diesel \u2013 was a victory for the transport lobby. These generous handouts are understandably welcomed by the business community. Yet they are only part of a broader set of measures that would be described as anti-business should any Labour chancellor think of following the same path. On business rates, the chancellor quietly ignored a report he commissioned that proposed sweeping reforms and offered as a sop the prospect of more frequent revaluations. However, it was Osborne who delayed the 2015 revaluation until next year. Accountancy firms warned of trouble ahead \u2013 probably picturing themselves in meetings with irate company bosses slapped with higher-than-expected rate bills \u2013 but business lobby groups only wrote eulogies. Then there was the plan to bring forward corporation tax payments in a modernisation programme that will add \u00a39bn to the exchequer in the initial years. That was delayed from 2017 to 2019 to help the Treasury reach its surplus target in the following year. The chopping and changing will not be welcome news. Another 0.5 percentage points on insurance premium tax, which has become the chancellor\u2019s cash cow of choice, could hit one of Britain\u2019s few world-beating industries if homeowners decide to stop buying cover. From a business perspective, North Sea oil and the financial sector pay hefty tax bills in the good years. Osborne\u2019s tendency is to overtax them for a quick gain \u2013 and stifle investment. That happened to Scotland\u2019s oil industry after raids in 2011 and 2012 when the oil price was high. The same attitude could hurt the UK\u2019s insurance industry now. But the business lobby groups kept their counsel, just as they did over a restriction on the amount of interest payments they can set against tax. This measure, which will hit companies that borrow heavily in the UK to finance operations overseas, is expected to raise almost \u00a34bn. This is no doubt the subject of back-door lobbying, but there has been little public condemnation. Not much was said about an attack on \u201chybrid mismatch\u201d schemes, which as my Guardian colleague Nils Pratley has pointed out, are designed to bury expenses in complex accounts to avoid tax. This will produce \u00a3950m, says the Treasury. Another \u00a312bn is due to come from measures to \u201cstop tax evasion, prevent tax avoidance and tackle imbalances in the system\u201d. Big businesses operating in the UK might have expected their lobbyists to man the barricades in defence of legitimate accounting practices that have boosted shareholder returns and made Britain a great place to do business. Not a bit of it, which means they think neither of these measures will have the impact the Treasury has claimed, or that Osborne\u2019s small-government agenda, privatising zeal and headline tax cuts are worth the sacrifice. After Osborne sat down, CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn praised Osborne\u2019s warm words on infrastructure \u2013 when there had been no new money and his record is lamentable. She applauded his devolution plans \u2013 when London mayor Boris Johnson got the most favourable settlement on business rates. Osborne\u2019s theatrics, which often mean announcing major, and almost instant, changes to business taxes, are never criticised. These surprises have wiped out some firms and meant yearly chopping and changing to the tax rules. Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling came under fire from the business community for their higher taxes and more complicated financial legislation. But at least they consulted on planned reforms. Osborne consults only after the budget has been published. And why not, when the business community is so forgiving?",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Like Easter, the start to the buying season for househunters has come early this year. Mortgage approvals in February were 20% up on the same month in 2015. It\u2019s not hard to see why. Higher stamp duty on buy-to-let properties and second homes comes into force at the start of April, creating an incentive for potential purchasers to evade the clutches of the taxman. The surge in activity is giving an added upward twist to house prices, which are rising by around 10% a year \u2013 five times faster than average earnings. Britain has been here before. In 1988, there was an orgy of buying after Nigel Lawson announced in his spring budget that double mortgage interest relief for couples would be abolished in August that year. The boom was followed by a six-year slump that saw a record number of home repossessions. Could this happen again? Well, clearly many of the same ingredients are in place. Mortgage demand is strong, prices are going up fast and there is a strong belief among buyers that the market can only ever go up. All that is lacking is a trigger, provided in 1988 and 1989 by a doubling of interest rates from 7.5% to 15% in little more than a year. Prices started to fall and those who had joined the party late found that they couldn\u2019t keep up the monthly payments on homes that were worth less than they paid for them. The Bank of England currently has no plans to raise interest rates, which have been pegged at 0.5% for the past seven years. Even so, Threadneedle Street is rightly concerned about the amount of money being pumped into buy to let and the vulnerability of the sector to even a modest increase in the cost of borrowing. The terms of buy-to-let mortgages tend to be less onerous than they are for owner-occupiers, and this tends to accentuate the boom-bust cycle. Why? Because it encourages buy to let when the property market is hot, but means the buy-to-let sector is more sensitive to rising interest rates. The Bank is keen to avoid a downturn in the housing market being amplified by buy-to-let landlords selling up en masse because their investments have gone sour. On Tuesday, the Bank will publish the findings of its Prudential Regulation Authority on underwriting standards for buy-to-let contracts. Put simply, Threadneedle Street suspects that the clock has been turned back to the days before the 2007 financial crisis, when lenders were not especially picky about who got a mortgage. The problem is that the Bank has been making this point for a while now and is starting to look a bit like the boy who cried wolf. Potential buy-to-let landlords know that there is not going to be a doubling of interest rates, as there was in the late 1980s, and could be forgiven for believing that Mark Carney and the rest of the financial policy committee are all talk. It really is time for the Bank to put up or shut up. The FPC could do a number of things. It could say that the percentage of buy-to-let mortgages granted by a lender should not exceed a certain percentage. It could tighten the terms of buy-to-let loans so that they are brought into line with the more stringent yardsticks used for owner-occupiers. It could force lenders to hold more capital against buy-to-let loans, thus making them less profitable. Or it could try a combination of all three. If the Bank again does nothing, lenders will assume \u2013 quite understandably \u2013 that permanently low interest rates, FPC timidity and the ability of landlords to pass on higher stamp duty to tenants in the form of higher rents make buy-to-let pretty much risk-free. But it isn\u2019t. There is a bubble inflating out there that needs to be pricked \u2013 and the sooner the better. Frackers no longer cooking with gas After all the hoopla about the US shale gas \u201crevolution\u201d, you might have thought the first shipments to Europe would create a stir. Chemicals group Ineos even flew journalists to Norway to witness its first tanker discharging gas from Pennsylvania shale fields at Rafnes, but headlines were few. This is mainly because the bubble of excitement around low-cost American gas has been popped by the collapse of hydrocarbon prices worldwide. Similarly there was little euphoria about the huge, and hugely expensive, Gorgon gas project in Australia coming on stream last week. That $54bn scheme was meant to work wonders for Chevron and its partner Shell, but the liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments are sailing into choppy waters: Asian gas prices are two-thirds below 2014 levels and expected to fall further. Around the globe, as with oil, there is too much gas floating around. It makes no sense now for Chevron to export the Gorgon gas that is not already sold on long-term contacts. Nor is it likely to be worth Ineos\u2019s while to cart ethane 3,800 miles across the Atlantic to Norway \u2013 and later to its Grangemouth refinery in Scotland. But Swiss-based Ineos no doubt expects prices to recover and is also hedging its bets. It has bought $750m of North Sea fields from Russia\u2019s Mikhail Fridman, and is promising to invest \u00a3640m in Britain if a shale boom can be created here. There is currently no shale gas drilling in the UK, although pioneers such as Cuadrilla Resources and Igas hope it will not be long before planning authorities consent to more wells. Murdo Fraser, the Conservative member of the Scottish parliament, has been using Ineos\u2019s planned imports to Grangemouth to bang the drum in favour of a homegrown industry. Would-be UK frackers still face major opposition from environmentalists and people living near potential shale sites, but, just like US ones, they have a bigger problem at the moment: the bottom has fallen out of the market. For his Next trick Lord Wolfson is rarely the most cheerful man on the high street, even when Next, the retailer he runs, is trading well. However, this time, there may well be some substance to his pessimism. The Next boss warned the retailer faced the toughest year since 2008, sending its shares down 15%. This is partly down to a wider slowdown in consumer spending, but the main concerns about Next are unique to the Leicester-based chain. Critics of the company have often questioned why it has been able to increase profits ahead of the market, when its ranges of clothing can appear so dowdy. The answer is its credit business, which generates more than \u00a3150m in interest charges for Next and encourages customers to spend more. However, the number of credit customers is now in decline and Next is struggling to turn it around. Given that Next faces tough competition from the likes of Zara, Primark and Marks &amp; Spencer, the weakening of this potent weapon poses a genuine problem for Wolfson.",

Potential buy-to-let landlords know that there is not going to be a doubling of interest rates, as there was in the late 1980s, and could be forgiven for believing that Mark Carney and the rest of the financial policy committee are all talk. It really is time for the Bank to put up or shut up.</p> <p>The FPC could do a number of things. It could say that the percentage of buy-to-let mortgages granted by a lender should not exceed a certain percentage. It could tighten the terms of buy-to-let loans so that they are brought into line with the more stringent yardsticks used for owner-occupiers. It could force lenders to hold more capital against buy-to-let loans, thus making them less profitable. Or it could try a combination of all three.</p> <p>If the Bank again does nothing, lenders will assume \u2013 quite understandably \u2013 that permanently low interest rates, FPC timidity and the ability of landlords to pass on higher stamp duty to tenants in the form of higher rents make buy-to-let pretty much risk-free. But it isn\u2019t. There is a bubble inflating out there that needs to be pricked \u2013 and the sooner the better.</p> <h2>Frackers no longer cooking with gas</h2> <p>After all the hoopla about the US shale gas \u201crevolution\u201d, you might have thought the first shipments to Europe would create a stir. Chemicals group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/23/first-us-shale-gas-europe-ineos-arrives-norway\" title=\"\">Ineos even flew journalists to Norway</a> to witness its first tanker discharging gas from Pennsylvania shale fields at Rafnes, but headlines were few. This is mainly because the bubble of excitement around low-cost American gas has been popped by the collapse of hydrocarbon prices worldwide.</p> <p>Similarly there was little euphoria about the huge, and hugely expensive, Gorgon gas project in Australia coming on stream last week. That $54bn scheme was meant to work wonders for Chevron and its partner Shell, but the liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments are sailing into choppy waters: Asian gas prices are two-thirds below 2014 levels and expected to fall further.</p> <p>Around the globe, as with oil, there is too much gas floating around. It makes no sense now for Chevron to export the Gorgon gas that is not already sold on long-term contacts. Nor is it likely to be worth Ineos\u2019s while to cart ethane 3,800 miles across the Atlantic to Norway \u2013 and later to its Grangemouth refinery in Scotland.</p> <p>But Swiss-based Ineos no doubt expects prices to recover and is also hedging its bets. It has bought $750m of North Sea fields from Russia\u2019s Mikhail Fridman, and is promising to invest \u00a3640m in Britain if a shale boom can be created here. There is currently no shale gas drilling in the UK, although pioneers such as Cuadrilla Resources and Igas hope it will not be long before planning authorities consent to more wells. Murdo Fraser, the Conservative member of the Scottish parliament, has been using Ineos\u2019s planned imports to Grangemouth to bang the drum in favour of a homegrown industry.</p> <p>Would-be UK frackers still face major opposition from environmentalists and people living near potential shale sites, but, just like US ones, they have a bigger problem at the moment: the bottom has fallen out of the market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"960c246ce5261f3e4d1de846726dae26b23894eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/960c246ce5261f3e4d1de846726dae26b23894eb/0_371_1984_1190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wolfson: even more pessimistic than usual.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wolfson: even more pessimistic than usual.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Next/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>For his Next trick</h2> <p>Lord Wolfson is rarely the most cheerful man on the high street, even when Next, the retailer he runs, is trading well. However, this time, there may well be some substance to his pessimism.</p> <p>The Next boss warned the retailer faced the toughest year since 2008, sending its shares down 15%. This is partly down to a wider slowdown in consumer spending, but the main concerns about Next are unique to the Leicester-based chain.</p> <p>Critics of the company have often questioned why it has been able to increase profits ahead of the market, when its ranges of clothing can appear so dowdy.</p> <p>The answer is its credit business, which generates more than \u00a3150m in interest charges for Next and encourages customers to spend more.</p> <p>However, the number of credit customers is now in decline and Next is struggling to turn it around.</p> <p>Given that Next faces tough competition from the likes of Zara, Primark and Marks &amp; Spencer, the weakening of this potent weapon poses a genuine problem for Wolfson.</p>",
