      "bodyText": "The US drugstore chain Walgreens is pressing ahead with a full takeover of the group behind high-street retailer Boots the Chemist but is rowing back on a controversial plan to shift its headquarters to Europe to reduce its tax bill. Walgreens bought a 45% stake in Alliance Boots for \u00a34.3bn in a 2012 deal that included the option to buy the remainder within three years. Confirmation of the decision to proceed is expected to come on Wednesday. The terms of the transaction are expected to follow the same formula as the original, with the 55% stake expected to be valued at around \u00a35bn. In recent months speculation surrounding the timing of the second stage of the deal has intensified after its emerged that Walgreens shareholders had lobbied the board to pursue a \"tax inversion\" and redomicile its tax base. Private equity backed Alliance Boots is based in Switzerland, where its tax rate is 20% compared with Illinois-based Walgreens' 37.5%. In the wake of Pfizer's unsuccessful move for UK drugs giant AstraZeneca, which was also motivated by a desire to lower its tax burden, tax inversions have faced political scrutiny, with the president, Barack Obama, stating that US companies which moved their headquarters overseas to save tax were damaging the country's economy. It is thought the Walgreens board decided that the political row surrounding companies that move their domicile for tax purposes could damage the firm's reputation among US consumers. Even if it goes down well with its shoppers, the decision to abandon the tax move is likely to prove less popular with shareholders who argued that the freed-up cash could have been used to pay dividends or reinvest in Walgreens' US chain. The leak of the impending deal went down badly, with Walgreens' shares falling more than 4%. The deal will trigger big payouts for the private equity firm KKR and the Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina who bought Alliance Boots off the stock exchange in 2007 in a controversial \u00a312.2bn takeover backed with \u00a39bn of debt. The investors have already recouped their original investments of more than \u00a31bn apiece, with ownership of the outstanding stake split between Pessina, KKR and \"silent investors\" affiliated to KKR. In 2012 Pessina, who is based in Monaco, signalled his commitment to the business by collecting his initial \u00a31.4bn payment in Walgreens shares while the rest took cash. The full merger, which is not expected to be pushed through until next year, will create a global health and beauty giant with more than 11,000 stores. Walgreens, founded by the entrepreneur Charles Walgreen who opened his first store in Chicago in 1901, has more than 8,200 stores in the US. Boots, which traces its history back to 1849 when John Boot opened the first store selling herbal remedies in Goose Gate, Nottingham, is now part of a group with 3,150 stores in more than 25 countries. A spokesman for Alliance Boots declined to comment and Walgreens could not be reached for comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A surge in activity across the US services sector in July fuelled by spending on new homes put the economy on track for a strong second half of 2014, according to a business survey. Businesses recorded growth rates only slightly below the previous month's record as the US continued to rebound from freezing weather in the spring that sent the economy's recovery into reverse. But the Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) contained warning signs that the 4% annualised GDP growth in the second quarter was unlikely to be maintained after service sector businesses reported a fall in confidence and a slowdown in job creation. Meanwhile analysts also said a fall in service sector activity growth in China last month to a record low would dent confidence in the global economy's growth prospects and its ability to maintain recent rises in output during the second half of this year. Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist said the summer months could represent a peak in the rate of growth. \"The surveys indicate that the rate of job creation has waned, as have inflows of new business. Business confidence has also fallen to the lowest since late 2012 as companies have noted greater economic uncertainty and mounting risk aversion.\" The US economy suffered in the spring after the country was blanketed in freezing snow, closing factories and cutting transport links. The bounce was rapid and revealed all major sectors recovered most of the lost output. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve have hinted at an early rate rise should the momentum continue into the latter half of the year, but appear to be vindicated in their warnings that it is unlikely while the recovery remains bumpy. China, the world's second largest economy, saw its services sector slow sharply in July to its lowest level in nearly nine years. The HSBC/Markit China services PMI fell to 50 in July, the lowest reading since data collection began in November 2005, indicating a recovery in the broader economy is still fragile and may need further government support. A reading above 50 indicates growth while a fall to 50 shows the sector stagnated in July. Services, which account for about 46% of GDP and roughly half of all jobs in the country, have been one of the few bright spots in China's economy this year. Analysts said the sudden signs of weakness raised the question of whether Beijing will need to do more to shore up growth as well as consumer and business confidence. Qu Hongbin, HSBC's chief economist in China, said: \"The weakness in the headline number likely reflects the impact of the ongoing property slowdown in many cities as property related activity such as agencies and residential services see less business.\" He added: \"Today's data points to the need of continued policy support to offset the drag from the property correction and consolidate the economic recovery.\" China's main stock markets fell on the news. The Shanghai Composite Index ended down 0.2% at 2,220. The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.3%. Some economists blamed a slowdown in the housing market for the weak reading, as property-related activities saw less business. China Vanke, the country's biggest residential property developer, lost 2.1% of its value after posting July sales which showed a big drop from June. Poly Real Estate also slid 1.7%. China's manufacturing sector has continued to expand after contracting last year, but with government support that has yet to reach the services sector.",

      "bodyText": "Young people face a steeper climb to achieve the lifestyle of today's baby boomer generation, according to an index measuring intergenerational fairness which recorded a rise from last year. The declining affordability of housing for the under-30s accounted for the increase alongside a rise in government debt, which future generations must pay. The intergenerational fairness index, which was created by a charity, the Intergenerational Foundation (IF), to compare the burden faced by younger people with that of older workers and retirees, rose to 133 points in 2014 from 130 last year. The IF also found that under-25s suffered from stagnant employment levels and low levels of house-building. It said there has been a rise in the cost to the workforce of the state pension, while a fall in GCSE pass rates would put an immediate brake on the earning capacity of many young people. The index also measured a decrease in democratic participation by young people and increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Angus Hanton, the co-founder of the IF and joint author of the index, said: \"Like overloaded packhorses, our young people are becoming increasingly burdened by other generations' debts while loaded down with debts other generations have never had to pay, such as \u00a39,000-a-year student tuition fees and record housing costs. When will government realise there's nothing left to take from the young?\" He added: \"In spite of repeated government assurances that the burden of government debt is decreasing, the 2014 IF index reveals a record total of \u00a31,254 billion of public debt, equivalent to \u00a342,000 for each person in the workforce.\" The index shows median incomes for people aged 22-29 have risen by 1% while median house prices have increased by 2.8%. According to figures from the Office of National Statistics, retirees have seen their incomes increase by 5.1% between 2007/08 and 2011/12, while working households saw typical incomes fall by 6.4%. Hanton said: \"When government debt and public-sector pension liabilities are combined, the resulting debt per member of the workforce is now over \u00a370,000, equivalent to more than three times median household incomes.\" Laurence Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston University, and the father of intergenerational accounting for the World Bank in the 1990s, said the index showed \"intergenerational inequity continues to be the moral issue of our day\". He said: \"Like an adult report card, the Intergenerational Foundation's vitally important intergenerational index makes it clear that the UK is failing its young.\" The IF called on the government to embark on a programme of \"intergenerational rebalancing\". It said: \"This could be achieved by encouraging a nationwide housebuilding programme to reduce house prices, reducing student tuition fees and student loan interest rates, better targeting of universal benefits for older generations, increasing public-sector pension contributions, scrapping the exemption from national insurance payments for those working post-retirement and shifting taxation towards property wealth rather than earned income.\"",

At a \u00a39bn-turnover business, fractions of a percentage point matter, and the currency effect isn't helping the continental operations. In the long term, Royal Mail still looks attractive given the cashflows and scope for efficiency gains, which is Woodford's argument. In the short term, it needs Christmas to be bountiful.",

      "bodyText": "This year's IPO frenzy has shown further signs of fading, as yet another company ditched plans to list its shares on the London stock exchange. Urban Exposure, an investment vehicle that funds the development of new homes, is the second property company to cancel its listing plans within a week. It was hoping to raise \u00a3500m to fund the construction of homes in London and the south-east. The company said it had received an encouraging response from prospective investors, but added that it was concerned about the \"prevailing IPO backdrop\". It remains in discussions with a number of them who may provide private funding. After a lull that lasted several years in the wake of the financial crisis, the London market saw more flotations during the first half of this year than in the boom times of 2007. Forty companies raised \u00a35.7bn from the start of the year until early June, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The money raised in 2014 easily outstrips the previous \u00a34.9bn record for the same period, set in 2007. There are growing signs, however, that float fatigue has set in after several market debutantes tumbled in value. Shares in Pets at Home have dropped 25% since it floated in March. Shares in AO World, the domestic appliance website, have lost 31% since its float in February while shares in the fast-growing fashion website Boohoo have dropped 22% since their March listing. Both AO World and Boohoo rocketed on their market debuts, triggering fears that the stock market was once again gripped by dotcom fever following the high-profile IPOs of Twitter and King Digital Entertainment in the US. This led to a sell-off in technology stocks around the world in April which dragged down stock markets. In May, clothing chain Fat Face became one of the first companies to pull its planned London listing in which it hoped to raise \u00a3110m, citing difficult stock market conditions. When the property management firm Clipstone cancelled plans for a \u00a3140m float last week, it blamed the summer slowdown. Last month the student accommodation fund manager Brandeaux decided against listing its troubled fund Liberty Living in what would have been a \u00a3400m launch. Hungarian budget carrier Wizz Air has also cancelled plans for an IPO. London's bluechip index, the FTSE 100, has come close to reaching a record high several times this year. In late February, mid-May and early June, the index pushed towards the all-time high of 6930 reached on 30 December, 1999, at the height of the dotcom bubble. However, along with other stock markets the FTSE has fallen back over the past week, knocked by concerns over early interest rate rises on both sides of the Atlantic and mounting geopolitical fears. It has fallen into negative territory for the year, and closed at 6682.40, up nearly five points, on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average suffered a fall of more than 300 points last Thursday, its worst daily performance since February, which wiped out all the gains made so far this year \u2013 just a fortnight after hitting a record high.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's dominant services sector enjoyed a stronger than expected July, raising expectations that one or more Bank of England policymakers will vote for a rise in interest rates this week. Activity in the sector \u2013 which includes restaurants, hotels, transport and business services and accounts for more than three-quarters of the economy \u2013 rose at its fastest pace in eight months, according to the Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index (PMI). The headline index rose to 59.1 from 57.7 in July, and any reading above 50 indicates expansion. Economists were expecting a more modest increase to 57.9. The figure offsets weakening growth indicated in the equivalent survey for manufacturing, suggesting that the third quarter got off to a reasonable start in July following growth of 0.8% in both the first and second quarters. Economists said there was no sign as yet of the slower growth predicted by the Bank for the second half of the year. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \"The survey data point to the growing likelihood of yet another strong economic expansion in the third quarter. We would expect to see GDP rise by 0.8% again if the surveys hold their current levels.\" Economists said that the better-than-expected PMI increased the prospects that one or more members of the Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee would vote for a rate rise when it makes its monthly policy decision on Thursday. It would be the first time that a member has voted for a rise since July 2011, when Martin Weale and Spencer Dale voted for an increase of 0.25 of a percentage point. They were overruled by colleagues, and Bank rate has been unchanged at 0.5% since March 2009. The MPC has made it clear in recent weeks that it will not raise interest rates until it sees a pick-up in wage growth, which is still lagging inflation, despite economic recovery. But services companies surveyed for the July PMI reported that their operating costs were being driven higher by increases in wages, reinforcing expectations that rates might rise sooner rather than later. James Knightley, economist at ING, said: \"[The services PMI] suggests that the UK economy is maintaining its momentum in the third quarter and will increase speculation that one, possibly two members of the Bank of England's MPC will be voting for a rate rise at Thursday's policy meeting.\" However, the majority of MPC members are expected to vote to leave rates unchanged, and any dissent will only be made public when the minutes of the meeting are published two weeks after the event. The last time the committee was divided was June 2013, when the then governor Lord King, Paul Fisher, and David Miles, voted to increase quantitative easing by \u00a325bn to a total of \u00a3400bn. They were outvoted. Heightened expectations of a rate rise in the UK on the back of the stronger-than-expected services PMI pushed the pound up against the dollar and the euro. Sterling rose to a session high of $1.6890, up 0.15% on the day. The euro slipped to a day's low against the pound of 79.330p. The all-sector PMI for July \u2013 combining the services, construction and manufacturing surveys \u2013 showed accelerating growth, with an increase to 59.1 from 58.4 in June. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club said the all-sector survey suggested a strong start to the third quarter but cautioned that it was at odds with other economic data. \"For example, July's GfK consumer confidence barometer dropped for the first time since December, while house-price growth (on the Nationwide measure) slowed in the same month to the lowest rate since April 2013,\" he said. Despite the increase in the headline index, employers across the three sectors combined created jobs at a slower rate in July than they did in June. In the eurozone, a combination of Markit's manufacturing and services PMIs revealed mixed fortunes for the region's biggest economies. Overall, the eurozone's composite output index rose to a three-month high of 53.8 in July, from 52.8 in June, suggesting the single currency bloc's recovery accelerated at the start of the third quarter. However, a breakdown by country showed a strong performance from Germany while Spain offset another weak month for France. The index in Germany and Spain hit a three-month high of 55.7. In France, the survey also hit a three-month high, but at 49.4 \u2013 below the crucial 50 mark \u2013 it was another month of shrinking activity. Williamson said that although the data overall was positive, the eurozone was still facing a lot of uncertainty. \"There is clearly growing anxiety about the economic impact of the crisis in Ukraine. At the moment, the effects seem to be limited to weaker growth of demand at exporting manufacturers, but any further escalation of the crisis could further subdue the overall pace of economic growth in coming months.\" The eurozone economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter, while unemployment remains elevated at 11.5%.",

      "bodyText": "As the plane touches down after a week or two away in the sun, it will be a relief to some tired travellers that the homecoming grocery order they placed online will already be waiting for them \u2013 shortly beyond passport control and the baggage carousel. Waitrose, in partnership with logistics company ByBox, will set up refrigerated lockers from this autumn in Gatwick's two terminals, enabling travellers to pick up their groceries on the way home. It is the latest such venture launched in the past few months as retailers respond to demand from British shoppers for click-and-collect services. Argos has revealed that shoppers will be able to pick up eBay parcels from 650 stores by the end of this year, while London Underground and Network Rail have both recently announced plans to turn their stations into pickup points for a host of different retailers, from Sainsbury's to New Look. Local shops, car parks and petrol stations are being turned into places to pick up shopping ordered online, and in the near future the chances are that even when you head to the high street or shopping centre, you will already have chosen at least some of your purchases. The timing of the recent announcements is not coincidental: while their customers are thinking only of enjoying the sunshine, retailers are already laying plans for Christmas. Selfridges' August opening of its Christmas department is one of the more visible developments, but behind the scenes retailers see services that bring together high-street retail and the world of online shopping as the key to winning customers this Christmas. The British may love shopping online, but they don't like waiting in for deliveries, particularly in the runup to Christmas. Last year there were chaotic scenes in some stores overwhelmed by shoppers trying to pick up their purchases. This year, retailers hope to offer them more options. \"The new battleground is going to be 'omni' services like click and collect and store staff helping shoppers buy goods from a wider online selection,\" says Andy Street, managing director of department store John Lewis. He says former high-street retailers have found they can fight back against the growth of online specialists such as Asos or Amazon by using these services to make it as easy as possible to switch between shopping online and in stores. Nearly a third of all John Lewis's sales are now online and that is expected to rise further to about 37% this Christmas. But that growth is being driven by click and collect, which is up by 49% so far this year.Already, John Lewis parcels can be picked up from a wide variety of different spots including its own stores, Waitrose outlets and from thousands of independent retailers via a partnership with specialist service provider Collect+. But the department store has also realised that transport hubs such as stations are gearing up to be the favoured shopping pick-up point of the future. This autumn, John Lewis opens its \"click and commute\" store in London's St Pancras station which will only offer a small range of goods to buy directly, but where shoppers will be able to pick up goods ordered online. John Lewis customers are not the only ones keen on the idea. More than half of British shoppers have now picked up online orders from a store or other convenient spot, up from 45% six months ago. Click and collect sales are expected to rise by 82% in the next five years, with food orders expected to more than double, according to analysts at Verdict Research. Tesco said 70% of its online orders for fashion and homewares were collected in stores last Christmas. Meanwhile, with growth in food sales hard to find, supermarkets are experimenting with a host of different ideas to help them tap into the trend towards pre-ordering the weekly grocery shop. Innovations include refrigerated vans stationed in supermarket car parks and special lockers with three different temperature zones that are being tested by Asda and Waitrose. As well as the Gatwick deal, Waitrose will be using refrigerated lockers at six stations on the London Underground and at Reading's Green Park business park after testing the idea with its own staff for about a year. Robin Phillips, head of e-commerce at Waitrose, says: \"Like many of the grocers we are still under-represented. Our lockers are a chance to put the brand on stilts and reach more people.\" It is not only well-resourced and internet-savvy businesses such as Waitrose and John Lewis that can benefit. A recent study by analysts at Experian for the former high-streets minister Brandon Lewis highlighted the way local shopping areas could benefit as the rise of click and collect brings online shoppers to local stores. Collect+ is a business that works with 5,500 independent retailers that offer their stores as pickup points for goods bought online from more than 260 retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, Topshop, Boden and Asos. Its volume of sales rose 70% last year and although its chief executive, Neil Ashworth, says he doubts the company will repeat that growth this year, he is still expecting a rise in \"significant double digits\". The network will add another 2,000 pickup points by March next year, giving more small shops the chance to entice those popping in to pick up their parcel to buy something extra while they are visiting. \"Click and collect is in the psyche of the consumer. People are leading busier lives and they are looking for anything that provides them with choice of how they buy,\" Ashworth says. He calculates that up to 90% of goods sold by online department store Amazon can be carried home rather than delivered to the door, with clothing, home gadgets and furnishings all popular. But he admits that competition between click and collect operators is toughening up thanks to new entrants such as Doddle, a venture backed by National Rail which aims to put pickup points at more than 300 stations for retailers including New Look and TM Lewin. In response, Collect+ is trying out new ideas including an upmarket collection point in the Westfield shopping centre in White City, west London. There, shoppers can not only pick up their parcel, but try on clothing and talk to a personal shopper who can find them an alternative if needed. It sounds suspiciously like an old-fashioned shop \u2013 but why quibble?",

It is the latest such venture launched in the past few months as retailers respond to demand from British shoppers for click-and-collect services.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/03/argos-ebay-click-and-collect-service-650-stores\" title=\"\">Argos has revealed that shoppers will be able to pick up eBay parcels from 650 stores </a>by the end of this year, while London Underground and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/18/network-rail-doddle-online-shoppers-pick-up-points\" title=\"\">Network Rail have both recently announced plans to turn their stations into pickup points</a> for a host of different retailers, from Sainsbury's to New Look.</p> <p>Local shops, car parks and petrol stations are being turned into places to pick up shopping ordered online, and in the near future the chances are that even when you head to the high street or shopping centre, you will already have chosen at least some of your purchases.</p> <p>The timing of the recent announcements is not coincidental: while their customers are thinking only of enjoying the sunshine, retailers are already laying plans for Christmas.</p> <p>Selfridges' August opening of its Christmas department is one of the more visible developments, but behind the scenes retailers see services that bring together high-street retail and the world of online shopping as the key to winning customers this Christmas.</p> <p>The British may love shopping online, but they don't like waiting in for deliveries, particularly in the runup to Christmas. Last year there were chaotic scenes in some stores overwhelmed by shoppers trying to pick up their purchases. This year, retailers hope to offer them more options.</p> <p>\"The new battleground is going to be 'omni' services like click and collect and store staff helping shoppers buy goods from a wider online selection,\" says Andy Street, managing director of department store John Lewis. He says former high-street retailers have found they can fight back against the growth of online specialists such as Asos or Amazon by using these services to make it as easy as possible to switch between shopping online and in stores.</p> <p>Nearly a third of all John Lewis's sales are now online and that is expected to rise further to about 37% this Christmas. But that growth is being driven by click and collect, which is up by 49% so far this year.Already, John Lewis parcels can be picked up from a wide variety of different spots including its own stores, Waitrose outlets and from thousands of independent retailers via a partnership with specialist service provider Collect+. But the department store has also realised that transport hubs such as stations are gearing up to be the favoured shopping pick-up point of the future. This autumn, John Lewis opens its \"click and commute\" store in London's St Pancras station which will only offer a small range of goods to buy directly, but where shoppers will be able to pick up goods ordered online.</p> <p>John Lewis customers are not the only ones keen on the idea. More than half of British shoppers have now picked up online orders from a store or other convenient spot, up from 45% six months ago. Click and collect sales are expected to rise by 82% in the next five years, with food orders expected to more than double, according to analysts at Verdict Research.</p> <p>Tesco said 70% of its online orders for fashion and homewares were collected in stores last Christmas.</p> <p>Meanwhile, with growth in food sales hard to find, supermarkets are experimenting with a host of different ideas to help them tap into the trend towards pre-ordering the weekly grocery shop. Innovations include refrigerated vans stationed in supermarket car parks and special lockers with three different temperature zones that are being tested by Asda and Waitrose.</p> <p>As well as the Gatwick deal, Waitrose will be using refrigerated lockers at six stations on the London Underground and at Reading's Green Park business park after testing the idea with its own staff for about a year.</p> <p>Robin Phillips, head of e-commerce at Waitrose, says: \"Like many of the grocers we are still under-represented. Our lockers are a chance to put the brand on stilts and reach more people.\"</p> <p>It is not only well-resourced and internet-savvy businesses such as Waitrose and John Lewis that can benefit.

      "bodyText": "Britain's big banks are exposed to multimillion pound fines and lawsuits that could dent their profits, the rating agency Moody's warned on Tuesday, as it downgraded its outlook for the sector because of new rules intended to prevent another taxpayer bailout. The agency reduced its outlook from stable to negative, because of the uncertainty faced by lenders to banks as a result of new rules on ringfencing high street arms from \"casino\" investment banking businesses. The new rules will mean taxpayers are less likely to bail out banks in the future. The ring fences, born out of the independent commission on banking chaired by Sir John Vickers in 2011, need to be in place by 2019, but the HSBC chairman, Douglas Flint, has called on the government to give banks more time to make the changes, which the bank has argued will cost hundreds of millions of pounds a year. Flint said on Monday that there was a \"growing fatigue\" in some of the bank's operations, where staff were having to work at weekends to implement systems changes, in part caused by the ringfencing rules. Moody's said: \"We expect the related changes in business models, organisation and funding structure changes to have significant implementation costs over a multi-year period, which, given their early stage of development, have yet to be reflected in banks' bottom lines\". The agency, which advises lenders on the creditworthiness of banks, is basing its analysis on whether bondholders, for instance, would need to take losses when banks run into trouble \u2013 known as a bail-in and something that did not happen during the 2008 banking crisis because the government stepped in with billions in rescue funds. Moody's is changing its outlook on the sector to reflect its view \"that the improved operating environment and banks' stable financial fundamentals will not fully offset the negative credit implications of the finalisation of the UK resolution and bail-in regime and the related ringfencing framework\". \"As a result of their final implementation, our current systemic support assumptions for UK banks will likely decline [during the next 12 to 18 months],\" the agency said. It also has negative outlooks on the six largest UK financial institutions to reflect its expectations that taxpayers would be less likely to step in next time. Its list of positive factors for the sector \u2013 stronger economic growth, improving profitability and fewer bad debts \u2013 was offset by the fact that UK banks are exposed to conduct and litigation charges which could hit profits and erode capital bases. According to Moody's, the six largest banks have incurred \u00a320bn of costs for payment protection insurance mis-selling, \u00a34bn for interest rate swaps and \u00a36.5bn for fines such as those for Libor rigging and money laundering offences. Moody's comments relate to HSBC, Barclays, the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander, Nationwide Building Society and the bailed out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. \"Banks will have to set aside additional provisions for PPI, but we believe these costs have peaked,\" Moody's said. \"However the large UK banks still face potential material redress costs of the sale of interest-rate hedging products, upcoming settlements and fines from US and other cross-border investigations.\" It described conduct-related costs as \"unpredictable\" and said that the \u00a3226m fine and compensation imposed on Lloyds Banking Group for rigging rates showed that \"even banks without large investment banking activities are exposed to legacy remediation costs\". With the banks being subjected to stress tests to assess their ability to withstand shocks to the system, Moody's said it did not expect any of them to fail when the results are published later in the year.",

Andy Haldane, the bank's chief economist, warned that the cause of the next crisis could be the massive buildup of risky assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions that lie outside the banking sector. He said regulators would need to be aware of \"risks emerging in the financial shadows\" that are currently paid little attention. \"It is likely that regulatory policy would need to be in a constant state of alert for risks emerging in the financial shadows, which could trip up regulators and the financial system,\" Haldane wrote in Central Banking Journal. \"In other words, regulatory fine-tuning could become the rule, not the exception.\" The Bank of England has warned several times about risks building up outside the banking sector, which has come under the regulatory microscope since the 2008 crash, but has usually focused on risky loans made by non-bank financial companies and trading by banks outside regulated exchanges. Haldane, who was previously one of the bank's heads of financial stability, said the vast scale of assets built up in investment funds and insurance companies posed a problem as it ebbed and flowed in and out of different asset classes, causing sharp falls and spikes in values. He said: \"With more activity outside the banking system, and with the banking system itself better protected, the financial system and economy may become less prone to the low-frequency, high-cost banking crises seen in the past. \"But that is not the end of the story. Risk, like energy, tends to be conserved not dissipated, to change its composition but not its quantum.

On regulation, central banks have gone from spectator to player, with some granted micro-prudential as well as macro-prudential regulatory responsibilities. On operational matters, central banks have gone from market-watcher to market-shaper and market-maker across a broad class of assets and counterparties. On transparency, we have gone from blushing introvert to blooming extrovert. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>Central banks are unlikely to return to those pre-crisis days.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this world, central banks\u2019 operational policies would be likely to remain expansive. Non-bank counterparties would grow in importance, not shrink. So too, potentially, would more exotic forms of collateral taken in central banks\u2019 operations. Market-making, in a wider class of financial instruments, could become a more standard part of the central bank toolkit, to mitigate the effects of temporary market illiquidity droughts in the non-bank sector. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>We also learn that Haldane is an A.A Milne fan.

of the change in outlook to negative for the UK banking system is that the UK government is now able to finalise the secondary legislation to implement the structural reforms relating to the UK

The slightly disappointing aspect of the report is that the expectations component has fallen to an eight month low, but this is no real surprise given the pace of recent expansion and the fact that sterling strength and the prospect of interest rate rises are potential headwinds.<strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong> J<strong>eremy Cook, chief economist at currency company World First</strong>, sees signs of \u201ccommendable strength\u201d in the UK economy.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>Job creation has continued the trend of improvement seen through the first half of the year, something that will only extend, given the rise in work backlogs hitting a 7 month high.<br>This will eventually show in wage settlements, although those remain low and stable at the moment.

Surging demand in the UK services industry has led to an increase in hiring, and raised expectations of a rise in interest rates. Spain and Germany have also seen a flood of new business activity, boosting employment rolls France\u2019s services industries managed to grow in July, but decline in manufacturing makes it the laggard among eurozone economies The chief executive of Credit Agricole reported a \u20ac708m (\u00a3562m) loss over its exposure to Banco Espirito Santo The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has said regulatory fine-tuning could become a permanent job for central bankers, in a post-crash financial system with more risk emanating from insurance companies, mutuals and pension funds. That\u2019s all from the business blog today. Thank you for following and commenting. US service industries continued growing in July, but fell back slightly on the previous month. The Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index came in at 60.8 in July, making this the 9th consecutive month the survey was above the growth benchmark of 50. The July figure was slightly below expectations that the index would remain at the June level of 61. Higher levels of work contributed to more hiring, although the pace of job creation slackened compared to the previous month. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the survey suggested the US economy was maintaining strong momentum, but warned that growth could cool. The elevated survey readings suggest that the economy is on course to grow strongly again in the third quarter, building on the 4.0% annualised expansion of GDP seen in the second quarter. \u201cThis is also a broad-based upturn: the services sector grew at a rapid pace, just slightly weaker than June\u2019s post-recession high, accompanied by a surge in factory production. However, there are signs that growth could cool in coming months. The surveys indicate that the rate of job creation has waned, as have inflows of new business. Business confidence has also fallen to the lowest since late 2012 as companies have noted greater economic uncertainty and mounting risk aversion. While the economy looks set to continue to expand at robust pace in the second half of the year, these summer months may turn out to represent the peaking in the rate of growth. Wall Street stocks have opened slightly down, largely in line with expectations following data from China that showed declining growth in service industries. The Dow Jones is down 0.35% at 16,510 points, while the Nasdaq is down 0.4% at 4366 points. The final tranche of today\u2019s major economic data is due at 14.45 UK time, when we have the US service managers\u2019 purchasing index. A preliminary reading showed the index at 61 for July, unchanged from June, which was the highest reading since the survey began in October 2009. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has not given any specifics on a possible tit-for-tat response to western sanctions, according to Bloomberg. He was speaking the day after Russian budget airline Dobrolet announced it was cancelling all flights, because of EU sanctions. Almost 30,000 Russian holidaymakers were left stranded when another tour company cancelled operations. Medvedev also said Russia may have to raise taxes as a last resort to deal with the west\u2019s punitive action. Via Russian state news agency Ria Novosti We need to analyse more variants of mobilising the [budget] income, [to consider] all possible options, including raising taxes, although this measure should be taken only under a worst-case scenario. Russia\u2019s prime minister Dmitry Medvedev says the government needs to discuss possible retaliation after EU sanctions against a Russian airline. Via newswires... I\u2019ll bring you more as I have it. Earlier this morning, we reported that France is lagging behind the other big eurozone economies. Delving a little deeper into the latest French economic data shows how entrenched the problems are. French service industries grew in July, to reach 50.4 on Markit\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index, an advance on 48.2 in June and good news from a survey when anything over 50 counts as expansion. But the details are not so encouraging: employment in service industries fell for the 9th successive month, although the pace of job losses began to ease. Jack Kennedy, Markit\u2019s senior economist, said services had moved on to firmer footing, but employers faced rising costs. The PMI data continued to portray a struggling sector weighed down by weak demand. Indeed, a further round of price cutting was signalled despite a continued rise in firms\u2019 input costs. The (relative) strength in services was offset by a decline in manufacturing, which pushed down the overall output index to 49.4. (JR) This is what Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s lawyers are saying about his offer to pay $100m to settle his bribery case. Via the FT\u2019s Frankfurt bureau chief (JR taking over again) Spain\u2019s Telefonica has bid \u20ac6.7bn for Vivendi\u2019s Brazilian broadband unit, as it seeks to grab a share of the fast-growing Latin American market. The announcement came as a surprise after Vivendi\u2019s chairman Vincent Bollore said in June that the company would keep hold of its last remaining telecom asset, despite repositioning the company as a media group. Vivendi pulled the sale of GVT when none of the potential buyers failed to meet the \u20ac7bn price tag. The company said at the time it would not sell at a \u201csilly\u201d price. The new offer comprises a cash payment of almost \u20ac4bn, plus new shares to be issued by Telefonica Brazil, worth 12% of the enlarged group. Breaking news: the UK services industry has increased at its fastest rate in 8 months. There\u2019s some good news coming out of Portugal for once. Its jobless rate dropped for the fifth consecutive quarter in the three months to June. The unemployment rate fell to 13.9% from 15.1% the previous quarter. That is a big improvement on the 16.4% jobless rate recorded in the same period last year. (Jo Moulds standing in for Jennifer over lunch) Italian financial journalist Fabrizio Santo writes that Banco Espirito Santo will be removed from Portugal\u2019s main stock exchange. The Bank of England has published the full text of chief economist Andrew Haldane\u2019s article for the Central Banking journal. And it is well worth reading, not least for a very good overview of how central banks evolved from the ethos of \u201cnever apologise, never explain\u201d into independent institutions in the public eye. Haldane explains how central banks had to re-invent themselves during the financial crisis. On monetary policy, we have gone from setting short safe rates to shaping rates of return on longer-term and wider classes of assets. On regulation, central banks have gone from spectator to player, with some granted micro-prudential as well as macro-prudential regulatory responsibilities. On operational matters, central banks have gone from market-watcher to market-shaper and market-maker across a broad class of assets and counterparties. On transparency, we have gone from blushing introvert to blooming extrovert. Central banks are unlikely to return to those pre-crisis days. In this world, central banks\u2019 operational policies would be likely to remain expansive. Non-bank counterparties would grow in importance, not shrink. So too, potentially, would more exotic forms of collateral taken in central banks\u2019 operations. Market-making, in a wider class of financial instruments, could become a more standard part of the central bank toolkit, to mitigate the effects of temporary market illiquidity droughts in the non-bank sector. We also learn that Haldane is an A.A Milne fan. The article is titled Halfway up the Stairs and quotes Milne\u2019s 1924 poem, Halfway Down. A quick update on Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s offer to pay $100m (\u00a360m) to end his trial on bribery charges. State prosecutors have accepted, but the deal has done down badly in Germany. From Josie Le Blond\u2019s story: Speaking on German radio on Tuesday, Germany\u2019s former justice minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger called the deal \u201ccheeky.\u201d If it were to go through, she said, \u201cit would not be consistent with the spirit and purpose of our legal system\u201d. Moody\u2019s have blamed regulation and misconduct investigations for their decision to downgrade the outlook for the UK banking system. Here is the statement from Carlos Suarez Duarte, a Moody\u2019s vice president. The key driver of the change in outlook to negative for the UK banking system is that the UK government is now able to finalise the secondary legislation to implement the structural reforms relating to the UK resolution and bail-in regime and the related ring-fencing framework. Banks are facing regulations designed to prevent a rerun of the financial crisis, including setting up a ringfence between their retail banking and \u201ccasino\u201d investment arms. On Monday HSBC chairman Douglas Flint attempted to sound a Churchillian note, as he complained about \u201cunprecedented\u201d regulatory reforms. I do not think we have ever had to ask so much of so many The demands now being placed on the human capital of the firm and on our operational and systems capabilities are unprecedented. That makes the timing of this Moody\u2019s downgrade especially interesting. Another factor in the downgrade decision was UK banks\u2019 exposure to conduct and litigation charges that Moody\u2019s deem likely to hit profits But Moody\u2019s, which along with the other ratings agencies faced criticism for failing to spot the financial crash, thinks UK banks are mostly in a good place The improved credit fundamentals of most UK banks -- mainly asset quality, earnings and capital -- put them in a stronger position to withstand unexpected shocks, such as a house price correction. Hot off the wires Credit-rating agency Moody\u2019s has downgraded the outlook for UK banks to negative from stable. More to follow... The story of the four largest economies of the eurozone in one chart Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, thinks the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee could be split for the first time in three years. The pick-up in the composite PMI somewhat increases the chances that the MPC decides to raise interest rates before the end of the year and may even produce a split interest rate vote tomorrow for the first time since July 2011. After all, the MPC has been expecting the recovery to lose steam in the second half of this year. Nonetheless, with inflation still on track to ease further this year and debt burdens remaining high, we still expect rises in interest rates to be much more gradual than during past economic recoveries. The MPC gathers tomorrow for its monthly meeting. Will interest rates go up before the election? That is one of the big questions preoccupying economists. And today\u2019s data showing strong growth in the UK services sector will only heighten expectations. Here is a round-up of economists\u2019 reaction to the PMI data: Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS, describes the services industry data as \u201ca significantly stronger report than expected\u201d. Not only was the headline services business activity index at an eight-month high in July, but other elements of the survey were largely very strong which bodes very well for services activity through the third quarter and beyond. He thinks this boost the chances of a rate rise: With governor Mark Carney stressing that the strength of data will drive when the Bank of England will first edge up interest rates, the overall robust set of July purchasing managers\u2019 surveys with strong incoming new business will likely be seen as supportive to a move in late-2014 rather than early-2015. James Knightley at ING also thinks a few members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will be minded to vote for a rate rise after reading this report. [The July reading] suggests that the UK economy is maintaining its momentum in 3Q14 and will increase speculation that one, possibly two members of the Bank of England\u2019s MPC will be voting for a rate rise at Thursday\u2019s policy meeting. The slightly disappointing aspect of the report is that the expectations component has fallen to an eight month low, but this is no real surprise given the pace of recent expansion and the fact that sterling strength and the prospect of interest rate rises are potential headwinds. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency company World First, sees signs of \u201ccommendable strength\u201d in the UK economy. Job creation has continued the trend of improvement seen through the first half of the year, something that will only extend, given the rise in work backlogs hitting a 7 month high. This will eventually show in wage settlements, although those remain low and stable at the moment. Sector strength was seen domestically and, more importantly, internationally, which stands in contrast to current thoughts from corporates in the manufacturing sector that the recent strength of the pound may be damaging British businesses\u2019 prospects abroad. Another forecast from Chris Williamson of Markit: Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, is forecasting a 0.8% rise in GDP for the third quarter if current trends continue. The vast services economy\u2019s growth surge shows no sign of abating. The July PMI showed the sector expanding at the fastest rate since last November, as demand for services continued to increase at a rate rarely seen in the survey\u2019s 18-year history. The buoyancy of the services and construction sector PMIs suggest the domestic economy clearly continued to boom in July, offsetting the cooling of growth seen in the manufacturing sector. So what is behind the uptick in services activity? Purchasing managers told Markit they had been hiring more people, to keep on top of current workloads and in anticipation of more in the coming months. Backlogs of work were increasing, although positive sentiment about the future was lower than in previous months. Companies also said wages were driving up operating costs. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index for services rose to 59.1 in July, up from 57.7 in June, well clear of the benchmark of 50 that signals expansion. Over 30% of the survey panel reported an increase in activity since June. Eurozone economic growth accelerated in July, on the back of an uptick in business in Germany and Spain. But bad news in France, where a slight pick-up in services was offset by deepening downturn for manufacturing. Markit\u2019s eurozone composite output index rose to a three-month high of 53.8 in July, up from 52.8 in June. Here is the full breakdown: Germany 55.7 Spain 55.7 Italy 53.1 France 49.4 The country-by-country picture underscores the weakness in France; on this Markit scale anything less than 50 means the economy is shrinking. The financial crisis has changed economic policy making for good. That could be one conclusion to draw from the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andrew Haldane, who has said central banks would find it difficult \u201cto beat an orderly retreat\u201d from regulating the financial system. In an article in the journal Central Banking, Haldane said central banks could have a permanent role in the regulatory fine-tuning of banks and other financial institutions. It is likely that regulatory policy would need to be in a constant state of alert for risks emerging in the financial shadows, which could trip up regulators and the financial system. In other words, regulatory fine-tuning could become the rule, not the exception. Haldane also warned of new risks facing the financial system, as a result of potentially risky activity from mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds. [The financial system could] exhibit a new strain of systemic risk - a greater number of higher-frequency, higher-amplitude cyclical fluctuations in asset prices and financial activity, now originating on the balance sheets of mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds...These cyclical fluctuations could in turn be transmitted to, and mirrored, in greater cyclical instabilities in the wider economy. The highlights are summarised on CentralBanking.com. I will try and track down a full copy of the text. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the Spanish PMI report, has given his verdict. A surge in new orders provided a real boost to the Spanish service sector in July, leading to a faster rise in activity and further job creation. Companies remained optimistic that these recent improvements will continue over the coming year. Firms still had to lower their output prices in order to achieve the sort of new business growth recorded in July, but the rate of discounting was the least marked since the economic crisis began in mid-2008. Spanish service providers saw new business increase at the sharpest pace since late-2006 in July, buoyed by a strong demand for transport and financial services. The Markit index rose to 56.2 in July from 54.8 in June, the 9th successive month it stood above 50, which indicates expansion. The best estimate of economists polled by Reuters was 55.1 Words of regret this morning from Credit Agricole\u2019s boss, after the French bank reported a \u20ac708m (\u00a3562m*) loss related to its stake in Banco Espirito Santo (BES), the Portuguese bank that received a near \u20ac5bn bailout over the weekend. On a call with journalists this morning, chief executive Jean-Paul Chifflet said the problems with BES and its founding family were not known to Credit Agricole. Today the group must deal with the issues specific to the Espirito Santo family and which took place outside the sphere of the bank\u2019s corporate governance and which were unknown to us. We can only regret having been misled by the family with which Credit Agricole was trying to create a true partnership to build the biggest private bank in Portugal. Credit Agricole has been a key shareholder of BES since the early 1990s. The Portuguese bank last week reported a higher-than-expected loss to cover exposure to companies owned by its founding Espirito Santo family. Quotes via Reuters. *\u00a3 conversion corrected Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Spain is growing, Italy slowing and France is stagnating. Germany remains solid, while the UK is showing healthy growth. That is what economists are expecting from a batch of data on services that will fill in more details about the health of European economies. The UK data is likely to show that services, which make up three quarters of the economy, are in robust condition. Economists have pencilled in a reading of 58.1, up from June\u2019s 57.7, on the Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index where anything over 50 counts as expansion. In France the reading is expected to come in at 50.4, putting further pressure on President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sums it up Today\u2019s numbers may paint a positive picture in some areas, namely Spain where GDP appears to be recovering slowly, but France remains a particular concern, with rising unemployment and an economy mired in quicksand, and a paralysed government. It is a very different story in China, where growth in the service sector has fallen to its lowest level in nine years. The HSBC/Markit PMI reading fell to 50.0 in July, the lowest reading since November 2005 when the data series began. Services account for 45% of China\u2019s economy and the stuttering performance has prompted questions about whether the authorities should do more to support growth, especially in China\u2019s fast-cooling housing market. Aside from data, I\u2019ll be looking at the fallout from the Banco Espirito Santo bailout. One of the biggest casualties so far is France\u2019s third-largest bank, Credit Agricole. The bank announced today it has taken a hit of \u20ac708m (\u00a3950m) in relation to is BES stake, wiping out its second quarter profits. More to follow...",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last month, the Bernar Venet Foundation opened in the artist's beautiful home in Le Muy, an hour from Nice. Among the works on view \u2013 by appointment only \u2013 is a metal chain sculpture by Arman in the beautiful grounds, pieces by Richard Long and Frank Stella in the spacious hall, and a painting by Sol LeWitt in the living room. Although Bernar Venet has lived in New York since 1967, he established a foundation in his native Provence in order to house his own works as well as his collection of minimal art. His foundation is unusual in that it was set up under US tax law, with 100% of the value of the donated works and funds to be deducted from income tax. Along with the Portuguese Calouste-Gulbenkian Foundation, his foundation is one of few in France to operate under a foreign tax regime. There are some 3,220 foundations that operate under the French tax system. According to a study by the Observatoire de la Fondation de France, an independent body that monitors charitable and philanthropic institutions, the number soared by more than 60% between 2001 and 2010 as a result of tax breaks introduced in 2003. Companies benefit from a 60% tax deduction on donations up to 0.5% of annual turnover, while individuals can deduct 66% of their donation to a maximum of 20% of their taxable income. According to Laurence de Nervaux from the Observatoire, \"French tax measures in favour of sponsorship are the most advantageous in Europe.\" The legal framework is, however, extremely complex. State-approved foundations benefit from the most favourable tax regime. \"That status inspires confidence. It's a guarantee of sorts, but it's a long and expensive business,\" said Eve S\u00e9jalon, from the French Foundation Centre. \"First you must make a donation of at least \u20ac1.5m [$2m] that you won't be able to recover, and then you have to wait patiently for a year and a half until you obtain the approval of the council of state.\" Of the 626 state-approved foundations, 100 are devoted to culture. They include the Maison Rouge, a private contemporary art foundation established in Paris in 2004 by the collector Antoine de Galbert, and the Hippocr\u00e8ne Foundation, a family foundation, which donates \u20ac500,000 a year to some 40 European projects. Another method is to set up a foundation under the auspices of an existing state-approved foundation. Some 200 companies in France opt for this system, which requires a minimum endowment of \u20ac200,000 spread over five years. The founder is free of administrative management and benefits from the legitimacy of the \"parent\" foundation. Most companies prefer the corporate foundation system, which requires a minimum endowment of \u20ac150,000 spread over five years. It takes only four months to set up but the disadvantage is that it cannot call on the general public for funding, or obtain donations or legacies from anyone but the founding company's employees. Guillaume Houz\u00e9, chairman of the Galeries Lafayette Foundation, which has an endowment of \u20ac21m over five years, believes that this format enables a company to \"lay down its commitment in stone\" \u2014 in other words, to make it professional and lasting. Setting up a foundation is good for a company's image, including the way it is perceived by employees. \"When we established our foundation it changed the way people saw us. It shows that we're serious,\" said Colette Barbier, director of the Ricard Foundation, which has been supporting emerging artists since 2005. \"It has been a breath of fresh air to the company,\" added Louis Roederer, deputy CEO. Another type of foundation, which looks likely to grow in popularity, is the regional corporate foundation, which can be set up jointly by a group small and medium-sized companies. \"It's difficult to carry out corporate sponsorship on your own when your company only has an annual turnover of \u20ac1m,\" said Robert Fohr, in charge of the sponsorship unit at the French ministry of culture. \"By getting together, companies can do more and do it better.\" Since 2009, a new system has proved very popular: the French version of the US endowment fund. This can be set up within a fortnight at the prefecture headquarters, has no minimum financing requirement and only minimal governance. It has proved very successful with 1,660 such funds set up in just four years, more than 20% of which are involved in the cultural arena. The Fran\u00e7ois Pinault Foundation, established in Amsterdam by the eponymous millionaire, may soon switch to this highly flexible format. These funds were designed first and foremost as vehicles for individual philanthropy but are increasingly attracting companies, including the property development group Emerige, which has just set up its own contemporary art fund. For the hypermarket magnate, Michel-Edouard Leclerc, chairman of the H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Edouard Leclerc Fund for Culture in Landerneau (Brittany), the endowment fund guarantees independence. \"We can move faster because we don't have to answer to the government,\" he said. \"The only shortcoming is that the word 'fund' doesn't carry as much weight as 'foundation'\". But the Bordeaux wine magnate, Bernard Magrez, believes that enthusiasm for these funds will die down. In 2012, 36% proved to be inactive, and 60% were just empty shells without any funding at all. The biennial survey carried out by Admical, an organisation that promotes the development of corporate sponsorship, highlighted a snag in this apparent profusion of funds and foundations. Cultural sponsorship, which totalled nearly \u20ac500m two years ago, has dropped to \u20ac364m. The survey showed that in 2012 more than 25% of corporate sponsorship was devoted to culture. But now it stands at 13%. The companies questioned, especially the smaller ones, stated that they had no short-term outlook on whether or not they would pursue their commitment. About 10% were considering reducing their sponsorship budget and 8% were thinking pulling out altogether. The reason, in addition to the economic crisis, which has hit small and medium-sized companies hard, lies in the current uncertainty over taxation. Since Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was elected in 2012, the government has regularly stated that it will reduce tax vehicles and companies fear they will bear the brunt. \"We need a clear message,\" said St\u00e9phane Martinez, chairman of Fondation M\u00e9c\u00e8nes et Loire. \"The government can't keep changing its mind, or telling us that sponsorship is a tax shelter. It's annoying.\" B\u00e9atrice de Durfort, chief representative of the French Foundation Centre, agrees. \"We have good sponsorship measures here that need to be grounded. Otherwise we'll lose everyone on the way.\" How different luxury brands approach sponsorship Luxury groups tend to set up foundations to promote contemporary art. Cartier was a pioneer in 1984 when it established its own under the auspices of the Fondation de France, an independent agency set up by the government in 1969. The Cartier Foundation has an annual budget of \u20ac10m ($13m). Although Cartier is synonymous with high-end watches and jewellery, the foundation promotes and supports popular art and emerging artists. \"We don't go in for sponsorship to the greater glory of Cartier, even though the name is useful because it is so well-known and respectable,\" said the foundation's chairman, Alain-Dominique Perrin. \"My first action was to forbid us from commissioning artists supported by the foundation for Cartier creations.\" The LVMH group, on the other hand, has asked artists such as Takashi Murakami and Yayoi Kusama to design leather goods, and in 2006 set up the Louis-Vuitton Foundation for Creation. The foundation's premises, designed by Frank Gehry, will open in October. LVMH has been a corporate sponsor since 1991 and has built up a contemporary art collection as well as sponsoring exhibitions. Herm\u00e8s came onto the scene in 2008, focusing on contemporary artists and artisans. \"The family was against the idea of a foundation at first,\" said Pierre-Alexis Dumas, chairman of the Herm\u00e8s Foundation. \"It wasn't the done thing to advertise any support we were giving, it was seen as boasting. And anyway Herm\u00e8s didn't need a foundation to exist as a brand.\" Public institutions, which often depend on donations from these groups, fear that these will be diverted to their foundations. \"Obviously choices have to be made,\" admitted Guillaume Houz\u00e9, chairman of the Galeries Lafayette Foundation. \"But our group continues to support public projects.\" RM This article appeared in the Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde",

      "body": "<p>Last month, the <a href=\"http://www.bernarvenet.com/\" title=\"\">Bernar Venet Foundation </a>opened in the artist's beautiful home in Le Muy, an hour from Nice. Among the works on view \u2013 by appointment only \u2013 is a metal chain sculpture by Arman in the beautiful grounds, pieces by Richard Long and Frank Stella in the spacious hall, and a painting by Sol LeWitt in the living room.</p> <p>Although Bernar Venet has lived in New York since 1967, he established a foundation in his native Provence in order to house his own works as well as his collection of minimal art. His foundation is unusual in that it was set up under US tax law, with 100% of the value of the donated works and funds to be deducted from income tax. Along with the <a href=\"http://www.gulbenkian.pt/\" title=\"\">Portuguese Calouste-Gulbenkian Foundation</a>, his foundation is one of few in France to operate under a foreign tax regime.</p> <p>There are some 3,220 foundations that operate under the French tax system. According to a study by the <a href=\"http://www.fondationdefrance.org/\" title=\"\">Observatoire de la Fondation de France</a>, an independent body that monitors charitable and philanthropic institutions, the number soared by more than 60% between 2001 and 2010 as a result of tax breaks introduced in 2003. Companies benefit from a 60% tax deduction on donations up to 0.5% of annual turnover, while individuals can deduct 66% of their donation to a maximum of 20% of their taxable income. According to Laurence de Nervaux from the Observatoire, \"French tax measures in favour of sponsorship are the most advantageous in Europe.\"</p> <p>The legal framework is, however, extremely complex. State-approved foundations benefit from the most favourable tax regime. \"That status inspires confidence. It's a guarantee of sorts, but it's a long and expensive business,\" said Eve S\u00e9jalon, from the French Foundation Centre. \"First you must make a donation of at least \u20ac1.5m [$2m] that you won't be able to recover, and then you have to wait patiently for a year and a half until you obtain the approval of the council of state.\"</p> <p>Of the 626 state-approved foundations, 100 are devoted to culture. They include the <a href=\"http://www.lamaisonrouge.org/\" title=\"\">Maison Rouge,</a> a private contemporary art foundation established in Paris in 2004 by the collector Antoine de Galbert, and the Hippocr\u00e8ne Foundation, a family foundation, which donates \u20ac500,000 a year to some 40 European projects.</p> <p>Another method is to set up a foundation under the auspices of an existing state-approved foundation. Some 200 companies in France opt for this system, which requires a minimum endowment of \u20ac200,000 spread over five years. The founder is free of administrative management and benefits from the legitimacy of the \"parent\" foundation.</p> <p>Most companies prefer the corporate foundation system, which requires a minimum endowment of \u20ac150,000 spread over five years. It takes only four months to set up but the disadvantage is that it cannot call on the general public for funding, or obtain donations or legacies from anyone but the founding company's employees. Guillaume Houz\u00e9, chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.groupegalerieslafayette.fr/en/\" title=\"\">Galeries Lafayette Foundation</a>, which has an endowment of \u20ac21m over five years, believes that this format enables a company to \"lay down its commitment in stone\" \u2014 in other words, to make it professional and lasting.</p> <p>Setting up a foundation is good for a company's image, including the way it is perceived by employees. \"When we established our foundation it changed the way people saw us. It shows that we're serious,\" said Colette Barbier, director of the <a href=\"http://www.fondationricard.com/\" title=\"\">Ricard Foundation</a>, which has been supporting emerging artists since 2005. \"It has been a breath of fresh air to the company,\" added Louis Roederer, deputy CEO.</p> <p>Another type of foundation, which looks likely to grow in popularity, is the regional corporate foundation, which can be set up jointly by a group small and medium-sized companies. \"It's difficult to carry out corporate sponsorship on your own when your company only has an annual turnover of \u20ac1m,\" said Robert Fohr, in charge of the sponsorship unit at the French ministry of culture. \"By getting together, companies can do more and do it better.\"</p> <p>Since 2009, a new system has proved very popular: the French version of the US endowment fund. This can be set up within a fortnight at the prefecture headquarters, has no minimum financing requirement and only minimal governance. It has proved very successful with 1,660 such funds set up in just four years, more than 20% of which are involved in the cultural arena. The Fran\u00e7ois Pinault Foundation, established in Amsterdam by the eponymous millionaire, may soon switch to this highly flexible format. These funds were designed first and foremost as vehicles for individual philanthropy but are increasingly attracting companies, including the property development group Emerige, which has just set up its own contemporary art fund.</p> <p>For the hypermarket magnate, Michel-Edouard Leclerc, chairman of the H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Edouard Leclerc Fund for Culture in Landerneau (Brittany), the endowment fund guarantees independence. \"We can move faster because we don't have to answer to the government,\" he said. \"The only shortcoming is that the word 'fund' doesn't carry as much weight as 'foundation'\". But the Bordeaux wine magnate, Bernard Magrez, believes that enthusiasm for these funds will die down. In 2012, 36% proved to be inactive, and 60% were just empty shells without any funding at all.</p> <p>The biennial survey carried out by Admical, an organisation that promotes the development of corporate sponsorship, highlighted a snag in this apparent profusion of funds and foundations. Cultural sponsorship, which totalled nearly \u20ac500m two years ago, has dropped to \u20ac364m.</p> <p>The survey showed that in 2012 more than 25% of corporate sponsorship was devoted to culture. But now it stands at 13%. The companies questioned, especially the smaller ones, stated that they had no short-term outlook on whether or not they would pursue their commitment. About 10% were considering reducing their sponsorship budget and 8% were thinking pulling out altogether.</p> <p>The reason, in addition to the economic crisis, which has hit small and medium-sized companies hard, lies in the current uncertainty over taxation. Since Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was elected in 2012, the government has regularly stated that it will reduce tax vehicles and companies fear they will bear the brunt. \"We need a clear message,\" said St\u00e9phane Martinez, chairman of Fondation M\u00e9c\u00e8nes et Loire. \"The government can't keep changing its mind, or telling us that sponsorship is a tax shelter. It's annoying.\"</p> <p>B\u00e9atrice de Durfort, chief representative of the French Foundation Centre, agrees. \"We have good sponsorship measures here that need to be grounded. Otherwise we'll lose everyone on the way.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-443543095\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GWeekly/2014/8/1/1406895792642/luxury-watches-010.jpg\" alt=\"luxury watches\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: STR/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How different luxury brands approach sponsorship</h2> <p>Luxury groups tend to set up foundations to promote contemporary art.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Is a booming service sector good or bad news? On balance, of course, news that what is by far the biggest sector of the economy performed better than analysts were expecting last month, is positive. But the cloud to this silver lining is that the latest snapshot of services provides ammunition for interest rate hawks pressing for an increase in the cost of borrowing. Two things stand out about the Markit/CIPS services PMI report. The first is the headline number for the purchasing managers' index. At 59.1 it was not only well above the 50 cut-off level that separates an expanding from contracting services sector, but also the highest since last November. The survey is not totally comprehensive, excluding retailing, energy and government-provided services. In recent times it also tended to point to rather stronger growth than the official data from the Office for National Statistics. But the latest healthcheck is still consistent with growth of around 0.8% in the third quarter of 2014. That would continue the trend recorded in the first half of the year, and would surprise the Bank of England, which is expecting the pace of growth to ease back. The second feature of note in the PMI is that firms are reporting that they are starting to raise wages. Stronger demand is leading to an increase in hiring, and that is feeding through into the level of pay. Again, this runs counter to official data, currently showing annual earnings growth of 0.7% excluding bonuses. Up until now, the Bank's monetary policy committee has been unanimous in voting for interest rates to remain pegged at 0.5%. But two schools of thought are emerging about where policy should go from here. One points to evidence of a slight cooling in the housing market, the high level of consumer indebtedness and the weakness of earnings to urge caution about raising rates too quickly. The other believes it is only a matter of time before annual growth in excess of 3% and a sharp fall in unemployment feeds through into higher wages, and that there is a danger of the Bank falling behind the curve. Tuesday's report from Markit/CIPS provides ammunition for the second camp. The MPC starts its two-day interest-rate setting meeting on Wednesday. The chances of the first split vote in three years and of dearer borrowing by the end of the year have increased.",

      "body": "<p>Is a booming service sector good or bad news? On balance, of course, news that what is by far the biggest sector of the economy performed better than analysts were expecting last month, is positive. But the cloud to this silver lining is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/05/uk-services-sector-growth-fuels-interest-rate-rise\" title=\"\">the latest snapshot of services</a> provides ammunition for interest rate hawks pressing for an increase in the cost of borrowing.</p> <p>Two things stand out about the Markit/CIPS services PMI report. The first is the headline number for the purchasing managers' index. At 59.1 it was not only well above the 50 cut-off level that separates an expanding from contracting services sector, but also the highest since last November. The survey is not totally comprehensive, excluding retailing, energy and government-provided services. In recent times it also tended to point to rather stronger growth than the official data from the Office for National Statistics. But the latest healthcheck is still consistent with growth of around 0.8% in the third quarter of 2014.</p> <p>That would continue the trend recorded in the first half of the year, and would surprise the Bank of England, which is expecting the pace of growth to ease back.</p> <p>The second feature of note in the PMI is that firms are reporting that they are starting to raise wages. Stronger demand is leading to an increase in hiring, and that is feeding through into the level of pay. Again, this runs counter to official data, currently showing annual earnings growth of 0.7% excluding bonuses.</p> <p>Up until now, the Bank's monetary policy committee has been unanimous in voting for interest rates to remain pegged at 0.5%. But two schools of thought are emerging about where policy should go from here. One points to evidence of a slight cooling in the housing market, the high level of consumer indebtedness and the weakness of earnings to urge caution about raising rates too quickly. The other believes it is only a matter of time before annual growth in excess of 3% and a sharp fall in unemployment feeds through into higher wages, and that there is a danger of the Bank falling behind the curve.</p> <p>Tuesday's report from Markit/CIPS provides ammunition for the second camp. The MPC starts its two-day interest-rate setting meeting on Wednesday. The chances of the first split vote in three years and of dearer borrowing by the end of the year have increased.</p>",

Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight The very strong July purchasing managers' survey for the dominant services sector provides a strong antidote to some recent signs that robust UK growth could be losing a little momentum. Not only was the headline services business activity index at an eight-month high in July, but other elements of the survey were largely very strong which bodes very well for services activity through the third quarter and beyond. With Governor Mark Carney stressing that the strength of data will drive when the Bank of England will first edge up interest rates, the overall robust set of July purchasing managers' surveys with strong incoming new business will likely be seen as supportive to a move in late-2014 rather than early-2015.

Jones, who ran the UK's leading employers' organisation between 2000 and 2006, said a business covenant would outline business's obligations to society and what it could expect from the government in return. Jones, currently chairman of Triumph Motorcycles, a corporate adviser for Jaguar Cars and JCB, and an adviser to Babcock International Group, said that in return for the government providing a skilled workforce, a modern transport infrastructure and a competitive tax regime, business should pay its taxes and make sure staff were looked after. \"Companies may have to make people redundant but if they do, they should make sure their people are retrained and make sure they get another job. They should take pride in paying tax and in being fair in their pricing policy.\" The former CBI director general added: \"The banks and the energy companies have done us no favours. The public still has a favourable view of small business but big business is down there with the journalists, the estate agents and the lawyers.\"",
