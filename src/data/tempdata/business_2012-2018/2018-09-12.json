      "bodyText": "Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary has told Chris Grayling to \u201cget off his backside\u201d and strike a deal with the EU to avoid flights being grounded by a no-deal Brexit, in a swipe at the transport secretary\u2019s overtures to individual countries. O\u2019Leary, who has transformed the no-frills airline into Europe\u2019s largest during his 25-year tenure, referred to Grayling\u2019s efforts to convince 27 EU member states to prepare bespoke aviation deals with the UK. He said such a plan was \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d, adding that \u201cChris Grayling has had no assurances from the EU that planes will continue flying\u201d after 29 March 2019, the official Brexit date. A deal would eventually be thrashed out in the event that flights to and from the Europe ceased, he predicted, because politicians would be forced to respond to public anger. \u201cEven Jacob Rees-Mogg and some of the crazier wing of the Brexiteers will struggle to explain why there are no flights to Europe,\u201d he added. \u201cMany of them have holiday homes in Europe.\u201d But he said Grayling should \u201cget off his backside\u201d in the meantime to ensure an EU-wide agreement that prevents flights being grounded at all. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cWe believe that it is in the interests of both sides to ensure continuity \u2013 but it is only sensible to prepare for a range of scenarios. \u201cThat is why, as the [European] commission will not yet engage with the UK on contingency planning, we have proposed bilateral conversations with member states to discuss arrangements we could put in place to ensure continued air connectivity.\u201d In his wide-ranging remarks O\u2019Leary also admitted making \u201cmistakes\u201d in his handling of strikes by cabin crew and pilots but vowed to put up with more industrial action if necessary. Ryanair was forced to cancel 20,000 flights last year amid staff rostering problems and industrial disputes in several countries. O\u2019Leary, who waived a \u20ac1m (\u00a3890,000) bonus over the resulting flight cancellations, conceded he should share some of the blame for the disruption, which has tested Ryanair\u2019s reputation for reliability. \u201cI need to improve my own performance,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cClearly we\u2019ve made mistakes [\u2026] with the unions.\u201d But he also refused to back down in the face of further industrial action, including large-scale walkouts planned by cabin crew later this month. He said Ryanair was \u201cwilling to accept strikes\u201d to avoid a rise in costs that might force it to raise fares, vowing that the airline would not \u201croll over like easyJet every time we\u2019re threatened with a strike\u201d. He accused the unions of promising members \u201cmotherhood and apple pie and 70% of the virgins in paradise\u201d but insisted staff were well paid. \u201cWe won\u2019t bend over because they threaten us with strikes,\u201d he added. O\u2019Leary made his remarks during a presentation of the airline\u2019s summer schedule, including a new base at Southend, two more aircraft at Luton and 23 new routes. He said the expansion would take to 26 million the number of customers a year travelling through London airports, predicting that continued growth would see Ryanair overtake easyJet as the airline with the most UK passengers in the next 12 to 18 months.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, former prime minister Gordon Brown has warned that the world risks blundering into a new financial crisis. Brown told the Guardian that nationalism, and the lack of a co-ordinated global response, means global leaders are failing to tackle important problems. He\u2019s well-positioned to comment, having been UK PM when the Lehman Brothers crisis blew up a decade ago. Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports: \u201cWe are in danger of sleepwalking into a future crisis,\u201d Brown said when asked to assess the risks of a repeat of 2008. \u201cThere is going to have to be a severe awakening to the escalation of risks, but we are in a leaderless world Brown also singled out the recent turbulence in emerging markets as a key concern, saying: \u201cIt is very difficult to say what will trigger it [the next crisis] but we are at the latter end of the economic cycle where people take greater risks. There are problems in emerging markets.\u201d Here\u2019s the full piece: Goodnight! GW In an unusual development, the Takeover Panel has forced Sports Direct to rule out a bid for Debenhams. This was triggered by those comments from non-executive director Simon Bentley, revealing that the SPD board had discussed the idea of a takeover. In a statement tonight, SPD says: Further to recent press speculation in relation to Debenhams plc, Sports Direct confirms that it does not intend to make an offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Debenhams plc. Elsewhere in the markets, the oil price rose after the latest US crude inventory figures showed a 5.3 million barrel drop last week. CNBC has the details: Brent crude futures were last up 58 cents on the day at $79.64 a barrel and briefly broke above $80. U.S. crude futures rose $1.15, or 1.7 percent, to $70.40 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U.S. crude oil inventories dropped by 5.3 million barrels last week. \u201cWe think oil market fundamentals are increasingly supportive of crude prices, at least at current levels,\u201d said Gordon Gray, HSBC\u2019s global head of oil and gas equity research. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has outperformed the Chinese stock market today. It ended the session up 39 points at 7,313, a gain of 0.5%. Ryanair\u2019s ever-quotable CEO has weighed in on Brexit, by urging the UK\u2019s transport minister to help stop flights being grounded after Britain leaves the EU: Trade war concerns are keeping a cap on the markets today. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has risen by just 0.1% in early trading. The Nasdaq is down 0.3%, as some semiconductor firms drop. Most European stock markets have risen, with the FTSE 100 up 32 points. But energy stocks are suffering, after SSE surprised the City with a profits warning following the hot summer (which hit demand for heating). Its shares are down 8%, while Centrica is down almost 3%. Back in Vladivostok, presidents Putin and Xi have visited the Okean Russian Children\u2019s Centre. Ten years ago, the centre took in around 2,000 children from China\u2019s Sichuan and Gansu provinces who had been affected by the devastating Wenchuan earthquake, which killed almost 70,000 people. These children received recreation and medical treatment at the centre, to help them recover and recuperate from their ordeal.Xi visited the center in 2010 when he was vice-president. They have also visited the local university, to underline the economic ties between the two countries. UK retailer Sports Direct has been making plenty of headlines today, as it holds its AGM. The first: chairman Keith Hellawell has stepped down, following scathing criticism of the company\u2019s corporate government in recent years. This move spares Hellawell another shareholder protest -- last year, barely half of investors supported his re-election. Secondly, senior non-executive Simon Bentley told the meeting that SPD had discussed merging its new acquisition, House of Fraser, with struggling retailer Debenhams. Bentley insisted, though, that no move was imminent as the group might \u201chave its hands full\u201d with House of Fraser, which it rescued from administration last month. Intriguingly, SPD boss Mike Ashley showed up at the AGM, having previously indicated he was too busy. So he may have heard from fans of Newcastle United, Ashley\u2019s football club, who turned up to protest against him. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s strident criticism of China, could the US president end up striking one of his famous deals with Beijing? Ursula Johnston, head of customs at law firm Gowling WLG, thinks multinational firms must prepare for a full-blown trade war, by working out how their supply chains will be hit by higher tariffs. But in the end, perhaps peace will break out? An exercise to identify the most cost sensitive supply chains can be undertaken by utilising existing company trade data which can be readily sourced from a variety of internal and external sources including government border authorities and customs brokers. \u201cHowever in the long-term, given that both the US and China are starting to realise the realities of an aggressive, closed approach to trade in recent months, one wonders if the more open and collaborative trading relationship with Mexico that has been recently implemented is more typical of what will end up happening in reality.\u201d Associated Press is reporting that China is putting off accepting license applications from American companies. It suggests that Beijing is widening its retaliation against the US trade tariffs -- moving simply beyond slapping tariffs on imports. AP explains: The license delay applies to industries Beijing has promised to open to foreign competitors, according to Jacob Parker, vice president for China operations of the U.S.-China Business Council. The group represents some 200 American companies that do business with China. In meetings over the past three weeks, Cabinet-level officials told USCBC representatives they are putting off accepting applications \u201cuntil the trajectory of the U.S.-China relationship improves and stabilizes,\u201d Parker said. Chinese authorities have promised to increase foreign access to areas including banking, securities, insurance and asset management. \u201cThere seem to be domestic political pressures that are working against the perception of U.S. companies receiving benefits\u201d during the dispute, Parker said. China and Russia\u2019s concerns about protectionism may be well-merited, but neither country has a clean slate on the issue. China has long been criticised for protecting its own companies at the expense of foreign rivals. It uses the power of the state to support domestic firms in a way that EU and US rivals can only dream of. Beijing\u2019s policy of \u2018forced technology transfers\u2019 is particularly controversial -- it makes foreign firms share technology if they want to do business in China. A chance to steal US secrets? Russia has also been accused of protectionism. Critics cite cuts in foreign worker quotas, and state support for the rare earth metals industry, agriculture and aircraft makers. Back in June, the European Union warned that China and Russia are actually the most trade protectionist countries. China set up 10 new trade barriers in 2017, according to the EU, followed by Russia with 6. That meant Russia now imposes 36 barriers to free trade with the EU, followed by China with 25 and Indonesia with 23, hindering EU export and investment opportunities. Newsflash: The chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland has warned that taxpayer can\u2019t expect to recoup the money spent rescuing the bank. Speaking on the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis\u2019s worst moments, Howard Davies said RBS had been focused on \u2018survival\u2019 ever since its \u00a345bn rescue in autumn 2008. He cautioned that the government is \u201cunlikely to recoup its investment in full\u201d, adding: \u201cThe focus on survival over a decade has had a cost. \u201cThe bank has lost almost 130 billion during the period. That amounts to around four-and-a-half times the bank\u2019s current market capitalisation.\u201d RBS shares are currently trading at 245p, less than half the 502p at which the bank was rescued. The UK government began cutting its majority stake in the bank in June by selling some shares, at a paper loss of \u00a32bn. RBS management have spent the last decade cutting the size of the bank, and resolving legal challenges from regulators over misconduct before the financial crisis. The scale of that task, Davies says, helps explain why RBS isn\u2019t worth more today: \u201cIt seems clear that, in aggregate, the cost of these remedies to the bank and its shareholders was very much greater than could reasonably have been forecast at the time. \u201cIt is another important reason why the book value of the bank is not greater than it is today.\u201d Ouch! Factory output across the eurozone fell unexpectedly in July. Industrial production fell by 0.8% during the month, compared with June. Durable consumer goods production shrank by 1.9%, while non-durable consumer goods fell by 1.3%. On an annual basis, production was 0.1% lower than in July 2017 - the first annual decline since 2016 - led by sharp falls in Italy. This may be a sign that trade war angst is hurting the global economy, and hurting demand for goods. Trade war angst has pulled emerging market stocks down to their lowest level since May 2017 today. Some traders are pointing to China\u2019s decision, yesterday, to ask the World Trade Organisation for permission to impose $7bn a year in sanctions on the United States. The move is retaliation on Washington for not complying with an earlier WTO ruling. It all centres on the duties which America imposes on China for \u2018dumping\u2019 goods on the US market at artificially low prices. That process, The U.S. calculation method, known as \u201czeroing\u201d, has been ruled illegal in a series of trade disputes brought to the WTO. China says America hasn\u2019t obeyed these previous rulings, so now wants authorisation to impose $7bn of tariffs in response. More details here. There are also signs in Vladivostok that relations between China and Japan are warming up. Japanese PM Shinzo Abe told the economic forum that he hopes to visit China soon, and to welcome Xi to Japan in the future too. Abe said: \u201cIn response to China\u2019s gracious invitation, I intend to visit China this year, the year in which we commemorate the 40th anniversary of the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China,\u201d \u201cAfter that, I very much wish to invite President Xi to Japan. Through this exchange of visits at the leaders\u2019 level, I hope to raise Japan-China relations to a new stage.\u201d That may just sound like warm words (the diplomatic equivalent of \u201cdarling, you really must come round for supper!\u201d). But don\u2019t forget, Tokyo and Beijing were recently at odds over a group of islands in the East China sea (known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China). Those clashes raised fears of a military clash between the two Asian powerhouses - so today\u2019s friendly noises are significant. As a teetotaler, Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t have appreciated the vodka being quaffed in Vladivostok. But the US president should still note the warmth between Xi and Putin this week. Such clear chumminess suggests that the White House\u2019s belligerence over trade is encouraging friendships and alliances elsewhere. Naeem Aslam, analyst at Think Markets, believes America could lose out, if its rivals band together: President Xi Jinping, already said during his speech at Eastern Economic Forum in Russia that the country\u2019s relationship with Russia is at all-time high. His message was clear that his country is ready to study other relationship and work on different projects with them. Putin just added more fuel on the fire during the conference and criticised those countries who favour protectionism- a direct hint to US. Trump needs to change his attitude or the US will become the biggest loser of this trade war... In fact, we think that we are moving fast toward a moment when the US will lose all of its control because other countries will have much stronger position because working together. President Vladimir Putin has now echoed Xi\u2019s attack on US trade policies. He told the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) in Vladivostok that \u201cnew forms of protectionism\u201d are on the rise, threatening the Asia-Pacific region. Putin said: \u201cBasic principles of trade \u2014 competition and mutual economic benefit \u2014 are depreciated and unfortunately undermined, they\u2019re becoming hostages of ideological and fleeting political situations, in that we see a serious challenge for all of the global economy, especially for the dynamically-growing Asia-Pacific and its leadership,\u201d he added. Other Asian stock market also fell today, dragging shares across the region to their lowest levels in 14 months. Japanese stocks fell by around 0.5%, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng shed another 0.3%. While Xi was speaking in Vladivostok, the Chinese stock market was heading into the red again. The Shanghai Composite index fell by 0.3% to close at its lowest level since late January 2016, as traders continued to be dogged by trade war worries. Indeed, it came within a whisker of hitting its lowest since 2015. Stocks in China have suffered badly from the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs, as they will hurt demand for Chinese goods in America. Beijing\u2019s tit-for-tat retaliation is also dragging on the market, as it makes US goods pricier in China. Yesterday Russian president Vladimir Putin treated Xi Jinping to pancakes with caviar, washed down with best vodka, on the sidelines of the Vladivostok economic forum. It\u2019s a sign that the leaders are committed to their alliance against America powerful position. As the San Francisco Chronicle puts it: Beijing and Moscow have developed a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d reflecting their shared opposition to the \u201cunipolar\u201d world, the term they use to describe perceived U.S. global domination. The rapprochement has been driven by a strong personal relationship between Putin and Xi, seen as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. The two have met nearly 30 times, and Putin said that the Chinese president is the only world leader whom he once invited to celebrate his birthday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade wars are on investor\u2019s minds again today, as the president of China launches a coded attack on Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies. Chinese President Xi Jinping warned this morning that the political landscape was becoming increasingly dominated by protectionism and unilateralism. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Russia\u2019s Vladivostok, Xi warned that: \u201cThere are deep and complex changes underway in the international situation, the politics of force, unilateral approaches and protectionism are rearing their head.\u201d Xi\u2019s comments come a few days after Trump threatened China with a further $267bn in tariffs, on top of the $50bn already implemented and $200bn under consideration. Faced with such firepower from Washington, the Chinese leader is now pushing for closer ties to Moscow. He told an audience in Vladivostok that China is keen to participate in development projects in Russia\u2019s eastern flank, arguing: \u201cWe have unique geographic benefits. China and Russia are the biggest neighbours, we have solid political ties. Chinese and Russian relationships are at all times high level.\u201d That last line may raise eyebrows in London, as the UK pushes for an international response to the Salisbury Novichok poisoning..... Xi\u2019s comments suggest Beijing is rather concerned by Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for imposing tariffs to get America \u2018fair trade\u2019. He\u2019s not alone. Yesterday, IMF chief Christine Lagarde warned that the US-China trade war could deliver a \u201cshock\u201d to emerging markets, which are already suffering from \u201cfragmented vulnerabilities\u201d. She told the FT that a new wave of tariffs could cause economic disruption and hurt poorer consumers. \u201cTrade is a positive, trade is a plus, trade needs fixing certainly but it is a tool and an engine for growth that should not be under threat, particularly at the moment.\u201d Later today, new output data may show whether the trade dispute is hurting eurozone factories. Traders will also be watching the oil price, as hurricane Florence approaches the US coast.

    "webTitle": "Debenhams comment by Sports Direct forces watchdog to intervene", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Takeover Panel has been forced to intervene after a Sports Direct director caused confusion by saying the retailer has considered buying Debenhams \u2013 before insisting he did not intend to make the comment. The intervention by the City watchdog for corporate deals prompted Sports Direct to issue a formal statement confirming it did not plan to make a bid for the struggling department store chain for six months. The company reserved the right under Takeover Panel rules to make a bid if there was a \u201cmaterial change of circumstances\u201d at Debenhams, with full agreement of the company\u2019s board or after a bid from a third party. Earlier on Wednesday Simon Bentley, the firm\u2019s senior non-executive director, told reporters after Sports Direct\u2019s annual shareholder meeting a takeover of the department store had been discussed by the board. Bentley said the move was part of talks about what might happen to Debenhams, which has been forced to refinance, sell off assets and consider closing stores amid poor trading. Bentley hinted there would be no imminent move because the group was busy handling the takeover of House of Fraser , which Sports Direct bought out of administration when it collapsed last month. \u201cWe might have our hands full,\u201d he said. He then suggested Sports Direct could move in on Debenhams \u2013 where it already owns a 29% stake \u2013 when the time was right. \u201cIf there are opportunities in the future we would be in a position to take advantage,\u201d Bentley said. Debenhams shares climbed 9% as a result of Bentley\u2019s comments, but Sports Direct later issued a statement saying he had not meant to suggest a merger between House of Fraser and Debenhams was on the cards. In the statement Bentley said his comments referred only to \u201ca general question about whether or not we discuss our strategic investments, and in particular Debenhams, to which I replied in the positive.\u201d Bentley added in the statement:\u201cI made no mention of any merger between House of Fraser and Debenhams, nor did I intend my answer to infer that.\u201d Bentley and Sports Direct\u2019s chairman Keith Hellawell both announced they were stepping down from the Sports Direct board just ahead of the meeting, even though they had both been listed for re-election. Bentley, who has been with the company for 11 years, said at the meeting that it was a \u201cnatural good time\u201d for he and former police chief Hellawell to step down as Sports Direct was becoming a bigger business. He insisted his exit was not prompted by a lack of support from independent shareholders, saying there had been a \u201cbig majority in favour\u201d of his staying on. Hellawell said he had \u201coverseen significant improvements in the working practices and corporate governance of the company\u201d. He will be replaced by the former Nike executive David Daly with immediate effect. It is not clear whether Hellawell, a controversial figure who has been under pressure from major shareholder advisory groups, had the support of independent shareholders who had voted before the meeting, because the motions to reappoint both Hellawell and Bentley were withdrawn just before the meeting. However, Mike Ashley, the billionaire founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, did take a battering from independent shareholders. Nearly 37% of independent shareholders who voted, wanted to block his reappointment. Sports Direct had said before the meeting that Ashley would not be attending due to other demands on his time. In the event, he did attend, but did not speak and went into a meeting room as soon as the official proceedings were over. Glass Lewis, the investor advisory group, accused the board of \u201cpoor governance\u201d and urged investors to vote against the re-election of Hellawell, , Bentley and Ashley. Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) raised concerns about employment practices while the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), said there were \u201congoing operational, governance and risk oversight concerns\u201d. The chair of the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum welcomed the exit of Hellawell and Bentley and called on Daly to commission an independent review of Sports Direct\u2019s employment standards and corporate governance. At last year\u2019s meeting, Hellawell defended Sports Direct\u2019s use of zero-hours contracts and said there was no need for an independent review of its working practices despite heavy criticism since the Guardian exposed how temporary staff at its depots were in effect being paid below the minimum wage.",

In the statement Bentley said his comments referred only to \u201ca general question about whether or not we discuss our strategic investments, and in particular Debenhams, to which I replied in the positive.\u201d</p> <p>Bentley added in the statement:\u201cI made no mention of any merger between House of Fraser and Debenhams, nor did I intend my answer to infer that.\u201d</p> <p>Bentley and Sports Direct\u2019s chairman Keith Hellawell both announced they were stepping down from the Sports Direct board just ahead of the meeting, even though they had both been listed for re-election.</p> <p>Bentley, who has been with the company for 11 years, said at the meeting that it was a \u201cnatural good time\u201d for he and former police chief Hellawell to step down as Sports Direct was becoming a bigger business. He insisted his exit was not prompted by a lack of support from independent shareholders, saying there had been a \u201cbig majority in favour\u201d of his staying on.</p> <p>Hellawell said he had \u201coverseen significant improvements in the working practices and corporate governance of the company\u201d. He will be replaced by the former Nike executive David Daly with immediate effect.</p> <p>It is not clear whether Hellawell, a controversial figure who has been under pressure from major shareholder advisory groups, had the support of independent shareholders who had voted before the meeting, because the motions to reappoint both Hellawell and Bentley were withdrawn just before the meeting.</p> <p>However, Mike Ashley, the billionaire founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, did take a battering from independent shareholders. Nearly 37% of independent shareholders who voted, wanted to block his reappointment.</p> <p>Sports Direct had said before the meeting that Ashley would not be attending due to other demands on his time. In the event, he did attend, but did not speak and went into a meeting room as soon as the official proceedings were over.</p> <p>Glass Lewis, the investor advisory group, accused the board of \u201cpoor governance\u201d and urged investors to vote against the re-election of Hellawell, , Bentley and Ashley.</p> <p>Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) raised concerns about employment practices while the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), said there were \u201congoing operational, governance and risk oversight concerns\u201d.</p> <p>The chair of the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum welcomed the exit of Hellawell and Bentley and called on Daly to commission an independent review of Sports Direct\u2019s employment standards and corporate governance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>At last year\u2019s meeting, Hellawell defended Sports Direct\u2019s use of zero-hours contracts and said there was no need for an independent review of its working practices despite heavy criticism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">since the Guardian exposed</a> how temporary staff at its depots were in effect being paid below the minimum wage.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two of the world\u2019s largest tobacco companies are financing opposition to a Montana ballot referendum that would lead to government-funded healthcare for about 94,000 people in the state. This week, regulators found that Altria and RAI Services, the corporate parents of the Marlboro and Camel cigarette brands, violated the state\u2019s campaign finance rules by failing to disclose support to a group campaigning against the measure, called Montanans Against Tax Hikes (Math). \u201cIt\u2019s a simple choice \u2013 Medicaid saves lives. Big tobacco kills,\u201d said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, which is helping organize the ballot initiative. This November, Montanans will vote on whether to add$2 to the tax on packs of cigarettes. The referendum calls for the tax to be used to fund Medicaid, a government health insurance program that provides care for the poor. Medicaid eligibility was expanded in Montana under the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama\u2019s flagship legislation as president that is sometimes nicknamed \u201cObamacare\u201d. The reform gave states the option to provide government-run health insurance to people who earn slightly more than the federal poverty level, and provided federal money to pay for 90% of the cost. However, Montana\u2019s expansion program will expire in 2019. To stop the program from shrinking \u2013 and leaving 94,000 Montanans without healthcare coverage \u2013 the referendum seeks a permanent expansion and a cigarette tax to pay for it. Cigarette taxes have been found by the US surgeon general, the World Bank and the World Health Organization as the most effective way to encourage smokers to quit and discourage young people from smoking. Montana\u2019s current cigarette taxes are $1.70 per pack, about the median in the US. Industry heavyweights collectively known as big tobacco fiercely opposeMontana\u2019s proposed tax hike. Together, Altria and RAI Services spent $7.7m opposing the tax increase through contributions to Math, which produced television, radio and digital ads. The race is the second most expensive in Montana, behind a campaign to unseat the Democratic US senator Jon Tester, according to the local station KTVH. According to a decision from Montana regulators, the tobacco companies failed to register as \u201cincidental committees\u201d in opposition to the ballot initiative, as the rules require. They also failed to disclose travel expenses, when cigarette lobbyists flew to the state to lobby the Montana Chamber of Commerce. The Montana regulator\u2019s report shows the depth of lobbying Math engaged in. In mid-May, Math had no public presence, but was \u201caware\u201d of focus groups Altria and RAI had conducted in Montana. The campaign against the Medicaid referendum picked up steam in June. At that time, Math told campaign finance regulators it was aware Altria and RAI were polling in Montana, but the activity was \u201cfor the sole benefit of Altria Client Services LLC and RAI Services Company and was not an attempt to influence voters\u201d. After that, Math, Altria and RAI appeared to work in lockstep. Together, the three entities planned a meeting to lobby the Montana Chamber of Commerce to oppose the ballot initiative. RAI prepared materials for the meeting, an Altria representative flew in to Montana, and Math attended as well. Later, polling and focus groups conducted by Altria and RAI were reported as in-kind services donated to Math. Altria and RAI even filed lobbying reports on the same days. Chuck Denowh, Math\u2019s treasurer, told the Guardian Math had, \u201ca broad base of support\u201d. Denowh refused to answer when asked about Math\u2019s primary backers \u2013 Altria and RAI Services \u2013 and said he would not stand \u201cthis runaround\u201d, before hanging up. But Altria and RAI Services, are not just Math\u2019s most significant funders \u2013 they are nearly their only funders. A phone number provided for Math in the group\u2019s campaign finance filings went to the voicemail of Shelby DeMars, partner in the lobbying firm the Montana Group. DeMars worked as communications director for the secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, when he served in Congress. Denowh is also a partner at Montana Group, but said Math washis \u201cproject\u201d. The Montana Group has run other \u201cgrassroots\u201d campaigns in the past, including Count on Coal Montana, which promoted coal-fired power plants in the state, and United Property Owners of Montana, which opposes public lands efforts such as the establishment of free-roaming bison herds. Math later provided a statement via email, calling the ballot initiative (I-185) \u201ca massive new tax increase that permanently expands Medicaid but doesn\u2019t allocate enough money to pay for it, leaving all Montanans on the hook for tens of millions of dollars per year. Montanans Against Tax Hikes plans to run a campaign and make sure voters understand why they should reject I-185.\u201d Altria and RAI did not respond to requests for comment. Smoking costs Montana\u2019s Medicaid program $81.1m each year, or $779 per household in federal and state taxes in the sparsely populated state, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Each year, tobacco companies spend an estimated $31.3m advertising to Montanans, and $8.9bn advertising across the United States. The Fairness Project is also aiding on-the-ground organizers to expand Medicaid in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah to expand Medicaid through ballot initiative. Montana\u2019s referendum is the only which also calls for a tobacco tax hike.",

    "webTitle": "Keith Hellawell's Sports Direct reign comes to a chaotic end | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse \u2013 for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley. The defining episodes of Hellawell\u2019s time have been about Sports Direct\u2019s reputation \u2013 territory where the chairman clearly isn\u2019t an idle bystander, or shouldn\u2019t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before this newspaper\u2019s expose that prompted the business select committee\u2019s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate? Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. \u201cOne of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,\u201d he said. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct\u2019s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes\u2019 notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when he said he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator\u2019s report. At that point, some of Hellawell\u2019s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man. Hellawell\u2019s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders\u2019 tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a \u00a35m fee to Ashley\u2019s future son-in-law, its new \u201chead of elevation\u201d, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via the purchase of House of Fraser. Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell\u2019s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley\u2019s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%. Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is planning a bid for Debenhams, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed. Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour\u2019s RBS plans Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, said Macpherson, \u201cbut steer clear of the banks\u201d. It is sound advice. RBS these days is only 62% owned the state, and could soon be minority-owned, so an incoming chancellor could not simply seize command and start issuing instructions. At the current share price, and at the current stake, it would cost the thick end of \u00a310bn to buy out minorities. For what purpose? There is much government could do to improve access to funding for small and medium-sized business but RBS is already the biggest or second-biggest lender to the sector in most regions of the country. Getting the state to underwrite those risks directly, or even to take on greater risks by loosening lending criteria, could be a very slippery slope. What if other big banks decide they won\u2019t compete with a state-backed lender with no responsibilities to outside investors to make a profit? Lack of strong competition in lending \u2013 the deeper problem \u2013 would be made worse. Macpherson\u2019s prediction of a \u201ccorrosive\u201d process, for banks and taxpayers, sounds on the money. Labour, if it\u2019s really gearing up for an imminent election, as shadow chancellor John McDonnell says, needs to rethink. It has, thankfully, dropped the idea of splitting RBS into 100 regional lenders, probably realising that the country does not need 100 new thinly capitalised Northern Rocks. The revised plan is less dramatic and, yes, by all means launch a \u201cnational investment bank\u201d to pursue a few economic objectives. But keep RBS, for all its faults, frustrations and past bad behaviour, independent.",

      "body": "<p>Nobody would suggest that chairing a public company in which Mike Ashley is the controlling shareholding is easy, but Keith Hellawell, during his nine years in the hot seat at Sports Direct, managed to make things worse \u2013 for himself, for the business, and, in some ways, even for Ashley.</p> <p>The defining episodes of Hellawell\u2019s time have been about Sports Direct\u2019s reputation \u2013 territory where the chairman clearly isn\u2019t an idle bystander, or shouldn\u2019t be. The most serious affair was the revelation of shoddy working conditions at the Shirebook distribution centre. Even before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">this newspaper\u2019s expose</a> that prompted the business select committee\u2019s high-profile inquiry, complete with damning conclusions, the Unite union had complained loudly, including at annual meetings. Had the board, led by Hellawell with the supposed authority of a semi-outsider, bothered to investigate?</p> <p>Yes, it had, Hellawell admitted in the aftermath. \u201cOne of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/07/sports-direct-board-turned-down-chairman-keith-hellawell-resignation\">he said</a>. In other words, a former chief constable of two police forces failed in the role of detective.</p> <p>Perhaps we should not have been surprised by the lack of real curiosity. The appearance of a comedy copper had been established in 2015 when Hellawell was questioned about Sports Direct\u2019s behaviour during the collapse of a Scottish subsidiary, USC, and subsequent purchase of the stores from the administrator after 200 people had lost their jobs at 15 minutes\u2019 notice. Hellawell stunned MPs when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/25/sports-direct-backstreet-outfit-mps-parliamentary-inquiry\">he said</a> he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened and had not read the administrator\u2019s report.</p> <p>At that point, some of Hellawell\u2019s value to Ashley as a shield was lost. On Shirebrook, the business committee insisted it wanted to hear from the main man.</p> <p>Hellawell\u2019s exit was announced on the morning of the annual meeting, meaning he escaped the possibility of another vote against his reappointment by independent shareholders. His chances did not look good. Outsiders\u2019 tone had not noticeably softened as Sports Direct has paid a \u00a35m fee to Ashley\u2019s future son-in-law, its new \u201chead of elevation\u201d, and embarked on its poorly explained adventure into department stores via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/10/house-of-fraser-calls-in-administrators-as-rescue-talks-fail\">the purchase of House of Fraser</a>.</p> <p>Some investors, of course, always chose not to object to Hellawell\u2019s presence, regarding him as an irrelevance given Ashley\u2019s tight day-to-day control. For the rest of us, though, he was the embodiment of why corporate governance matters, even at companies where the founder owns 62%.</p> <p>Nobody expected Hellawell to tame the uncontrollable Ashley but they did expect the chairman to show he was vaguely in the loop and on top of events. A chaotic last day, with Sports Direct forced by the Takeover Panel to deny it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/12/under-fire-sports-direct-chairman-keith-hellawell-to-step-down\">planning a bid for Debenhams</a>, was a suitably shambolic note on which to end. He will not be missed.</p> <h2>Nick Macpherson is on the money about Labour\u2019s RBS plans</h2> <p>Sir Nick Macpherson, the former senior Treasury official, is right: the Labour leadership needs to get its thinking straight about Royal Bank of Scotland. The current plans, which envisage using RBS as a vehicle for state-directed lending to small businesses, look like a confused mish-mash that could be hideously expensive. There could be a case for nationalisation on the railways, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/12/nick-macpherson-treasury-mandarin-warns-labour-rbs-lending-proposal\">said Macpherson</a>, \u201cbut steer clear of the banks\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The viral publisher Unilad, known for its commitment to student-friendly online \u201cbanter\u201d, is facing insolvency proceedings following a demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) amid concerns over the future of the site\u2019s Facebook-centric business model. HMRC issued a winding-up petition against Unilad\u2019s parent company in July, which is due to be heard at the high court next week. Such notices are usually issued when a business has failed to pay its taxes and the company could be liquidated unless it can come to an agreement. \u201cThe situation with HMRC is being resolved swiftly,\u201d said a spokesperson for Unilad, who declined to give any further information on the social media publisher\u2019s financial position or why it was facing the demand from the taxman. The British site is currently the fourth biggest publisher on Facebook, according to analysis service NewsWhip, attracting more interactions from readers than major news outlets such as the New York Times, MailOnline, and the BBC. It has continued to rise up the Facebook rankings in recent months despite the social network\u2019s insistence it is changing its algorithm to push higher-quality news in people\u2019s newsfeeds. There are continued concerns over whether such social media-centric publishers can continue to thrive and build sustainable business models, especially while relying on native advertising \u2013 where the sites produce their own content such as branded video for advertisers. A spokesperson for Unilad also declined to comment on claims that staff had recently been laid off by the site. There was also no response to suggestions that the company could struggle to pay the site\u2019s original founder Alex Partridge following a lengthy court case regarding his right to a stake in the company. Earlier this year Unilad co-chief executive Sam Bentley left the Manchester-based company following unspecific \u201callegations of historic misconduct made against the company\u201d, with Unilad saying other staff had been disciplined as a result of an internal investigation. The site began life as a viral Facebook page founded in 2010 by Partridge, an Oxford Brookes university student who coincidentally also founded its arch-rival LADbible. Unilad\u2019s original incarnation was briefly shut down two years later after being held up as symptomatic of \u201clad culture\u201d and facing a backlash over posts that made jokes about rape and homophobia. The Unilad brand and its Facebook page were later reused for a new site launched in 2014 under the leadership of Liam Harrington and Bentley, who were both in their early 20s. The site\u2019s main Facebook page currently has 40 million followers, who see a mix of lighthearted news stories, memes, and viral videos. On Wednesday afternoon stories include the \u201cTerrifying moment worker discovers dozens of rats under concrete\u201d, a video of a cow with three horns in Brazil, and a tribute post to the BBC series Peaky Blinders. Harrington told the Guardian in 2016 that publishers such as his are \u201csocial enterprises that are catering to everyone\u201d and in common with other male-focussed viral publishers, had toned down its more extreme and offensive content and increased the number of features on issues such as men\u2019s mental health. It also has a variety of sites and Facebook pages covering tech, gaming, food, and sport and launched a longform documentary series on the \u201cDark side of Britain\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "The housing boom is over and we are in huge danger if the economic tide turns | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a solid five years of rising house prices, across the nation, especially in Sydney, the boom is over. It has left the nation very much in debt, and while the Reserve Bank is mostly not worried, should our economy\u2019s run without a recession come to an end, we will enter an economic downturn with households and the economy more susceptible to collapsing house prices than ever before. The latest housing finance figures from the ABS confirm the findings of private firms that housing prices have been falling for some time now. In July, the value of housing finance was 8.3% below what it was 12 months previous \u2013 the biggest annual fall since the GFC: The biggest reason for the fall has been the drop in investor housing loans \u2013 a fall that is largely policy driven as the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and RBA sought to reduce banks\u2019 exposure to risk. While the value of owner-occupier housing finance is just 1.2% below its most recent peak, investor housing finance is 22% below its recent peak of December 2016 and 28% below its record level of April 2015: Given the link between the growth of housing finance and house prices, we can expect house prices, which according to some measures have been falling for nearly a year, to continue to weaken for some time yet: As ever, however, the picture is not uniform. The total value of owner-occupier home loans has fallen in New South Wales and is slowing in Victoria, while there has been a slight pick-up in South Australia and Queensland. Western Australia, on the other hand, has been going backwards now for more than three-and-a-half years: You might think that we would see a fall in the average size of a home loan. But this has not occurred, because while the total value of housing finance has fallen, it has not fallen by as much as has the number of people taking out a home loan. It has left us in a situation that even in NSW, where total owner-occupier housing finance has fallen by 2.7% in the past year, the value of the average home loan has risen by 5.3% to $463,200: The increase in the average owner-occupier mortgage size in NSW since the RBA began cutting rates in November 2011 of 43% and 39% in Victoria would have many hoping that the bubble has well and truly popped. This is especially the case since in that time full-time earnings in NSW have risen by just 21%. The problem with wishing for housing prices to fall is that it is a pretty harsh way to go about improving housing affordability. With that increase in housing prices since the end of December 2011 has come a very large increase in the debt levels of Australian households. This aspect was noted in a speech on Monday by the RBA assistant governor, Michele Bullock. Bullock noted that Australia has one of the highest levels of household debt in the OECD. She did, however, suggest one reason was that, unlike other nations, \u201cthe rental stock is mostly owned by households\u201d. She noted that \u201cAustralians borrow not only to finance their own homes but also to invest in housing as an asset\u201d. But while there has been an increase in investment housing debt, the debt to income ratio of owner-occupier housing is also at records levels. The amount of debt held for owner-occupier housing is now larger than the amount of households\u2019 annual disposable income: Bullock argued that while our debt levels are high, the current low interest rates mean our mortgage payments are well below peak levels, and thus households are not overall struggling with the large debt: She also noted that \u201cthe economy is growing above trend and unemployment is coming down\u201d, and households have taken advantage of the low interest rates \u201cto build prepayments in offset accounts and redraw facilities\u201d. This is one reason why lowering interest rates rarely has as strong an impact on economic growth as raising them \u2013 many households keep their repayments the same as interest rates go down in order to pay off their mortgage faster. It does suggest worries about a collapsing housing market might be not as great as it would seem given our level of debt. But largely that is because the economy has not had a major external shock for nearly a decade. The overriding problem, however, is unless incomes begin to grow faster than debt, the ratio of debt to income will continue to grow, and that means when we do have our next economic downturn it will be at a time where households are in more debt than at any time in our history. That is a precarious position to be in and why the lack of wages and household income growth during this recent period of solid economy growth is not only exacerbating inequality, it makes us more vulnerable should that growth come to a halt. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

In July, the value of housing finance was 8.3% below what it was 12 months previous \u2013 the biggest annual fall since the GFC:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Housing finance value - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/b8FqX/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The biggest reason for the fall has been the drop in investor housing loans \u2013 a fall that is largely policy driven as the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and RBA sought to reduce banks\u2019 exposure to risk.</p> <p>While the value of owner-occupier housing finance is just 1.2% below its most recent peak, investor housing finance is 22% below its recent peak of December 2016 and 28% below its record level of April 2015:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Value of monthly housing finance\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WOe7W/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Given the link between the growth of housing finance and house prices, we can expect house prices, which according to <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-11/property-prices-in-sydney-melbourne-likely-to-remain-stagnant/10231796\">some measures</a> have been falling for nearly a year, to continue to weaken for some time yet:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"House prices and housing finance - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/T5jKa/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As ever, however, the picture is not uniform. The total value of owner-occupier home loans has fallen in New South Wales and is slowing in Victoria, while there has been a slight pick-up in South Australia and Queensland. Western Australia, on the other hand, has been going backwards now for more than three-and-a-half years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Value of owner-occupier housing finance - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Nzoo7/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>You might think that we would see a fall in the average size of a home loan. But this has not occurred, because while the total value of housing finance has fallen, it has not fallen by as much as has the number of people taking out a home loan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Owner-occupier housing finance - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jqiG2/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It has left us in a situation that even in NSW, where total owner-occupier housing finance has fallen by 2.7% in the past year, the value of the average home loan has risen by 5.3% to $463,200:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average owner-occupier mortgage\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gKxVV/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The increase in the average owner-occupier mortgage size in NSW since the RBA began cutting rates in November 2011 of 43% and 39% in Victoria would have many hoping that the bubble has well and truly popped. This is especially the case since in that time full-time earnings in NSW have risen by just 21%.</p> <p>The problem with wishing for housing prices to fall is that it is a pretty harsh way to go about improving housing affordability. With that increase in housing prices since the end of December 2011 has come a very large increase in the debt levels of Australian households.</p> <p>This aspect was noted in <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-10.html\">a speech on Monday</a> by the RBA assistant governor, Michele Bullock.</p> <p>Bullock noted that Australia has one of the highest levels of household debt in the OECD. She did, however, suggest one reason was that, unlike other nations, \u201cthe rental stock is mostly owned by households\u201d. She noted that \u201cAustralians borrow not only to finance their own homes but also to invest in housing as an asset\u201d.</p> <p>But while there has been an increase in investment housing debt, the debt to income ratio of owner-occupier housing is also at records levels. The amount of debt held for owner-occupier housing is now larger than the amount of households\u2019 annual disposable income:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Ratio of household debt to income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XLaes/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Bullock argued that while our debt levels are high, the current low interest rates mean our mortgage payments are well below peak levels, and thus households are not overall struggling with the large debt:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Ratio of debt interest payments to disposable income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/i629Z/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>She also noted that \u201cthe economy is growing above trend and unemployment is coming down\u201d, and households have taken advantage of the low interest rates \u201cto build prepayments in offset accounts and redraw facilities\u201d. This is one reason why lowering interest rates rarely has as strong an impact on economic growth as raising them \u2013 many households keep their repayments the same as interest rates go down in order to pay off their mortgage faster.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/03/australians-told-to-expect-longest-and-deepest-housing-slump\">Australians told to expect 'longest and deepest' housing slump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It does suggest worries about a collapsing housing market might be not as great as it would seem given our level of debt. But largely that is because the economy has not had a major external shock for nearly a decade.</p> <p>The overriding problem, however, is unless incomes begin to grow faster than debt, the ratio of debt to income will continue to grow, and that means when we do have our next economic downturn it will be at a time where households are in more debt than at any time in our history.</p> <p>That is a precarious position to be in and why the lack of wages and household income growth during this recent period of solid economy growth is not only exacerbating inequality, it makes us more vulnerable should that growth come to a halt<a href=\"xhttp://www.theguardian.com\">.</a></p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "A former senior Treasury mandarin has warned Labour against using the taxpayer stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to direct lending to the British economy. Nick Macpherson, who helped bail out RBS as Gordon Brown\u2019s top Treasury official during the financial crisis a decade ago, said current Labour party plans for the bank made him worried, while warning nationalisation was \u201ccorrosive\u201d for banks and taxpayers. \u201cIt won\u2019t end well,\u201d he said of a Labour policy suggestion that would mandate RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. \u201cIf you want to implement socialism, I don\u2019t think nationalisation is necessarily the best way to do it. \u201cThere may well be a case in things like the railways, but steer clear of the banks.\u201d The warning from one of the most senior Whitehall officials under three successive prime ministers comes a decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global financial crisis and the use of billions of pounds of taxpayer money to prevent British banks following their Wall Street counterpart into oblivion. The Labour government of the day stepped in to prevent bank failures in Britain, bailing out RBS, Lloyds and other financial institutions to prevent the last recession turning into another great depression akin to the one that followed the Wall Street crash of 1929. At the height of the crash about \u00a3955bn of state support and guarantees were needed to keep the UK banking industry afloat, according to the National Audit Office. About \u00a345.5bn of RBS shares were bought. But while share sales have begun, the bank remains majority owned by the state. Howard Davies, the RBS chairman, spoke alongside Macpherson at the event in London to mark the 10th anniversary of Lehman\u2019s collapse, using his lecture to warn taxpayers they were \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to see all of their money recovered from the bailout. \u201cThe bank was rescued to save the UK financial system from collapse, not as a financial investment,\u201d he said. He called Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge to break up RBS into regional units a \u201cgenuinely alarming idea\u201d that would be both expensive and difficult to achieve, while suggesting it may never happen because the current Conservative government has plans to keep selling the taxpayers\u2019 stake. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has earmarked the sale of \u00a33bn of RBS shares in each financial year until 2023 as part of Tory spending plans, though he faces sharp criticism for losses on the bailout incurred by taxpayers, including from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The idea of using RBS to direct investment in the UK economy was made in a report by the economist Graham Turner earlier this year that had been commissioned by McDonnell. Under the plans, RBS would undertake the lending activities of the new national investment bank Labour would establish should it come to power. Establishing a national investment bank was one of the key recommendations of the Institute for Public Policy Research\u2019s commission on economic justice, which includes the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, senior business leaders and economists. A Labour source said: \u201cLabour\u2019s model of public ownership and plans for reform of the banking sector will deliver the stability and reliability our public service and economy so desperately needs.\u201d",

Adoboli, 38, who was found guilty in 2012 of fraud that lost his Swiss bank $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn), is being deportation to Ghana because he is not a British citizen despite living in the UK since the age of 12. He was released from prison on probation in 2015 after serving half of a seven-year sentence. Last week he was detained at Dungavel immigration removal centre in Scotland. On Wednesday he was transported to Colnbrook immigration removal centre, close to Heathrow. Campaigners fighting against Adoboli\u2019s deportation said they understood the Home Office had booked a charter flight for deportation to Ghana on 18 September, and said Adoboli is \u201cearmarked to be on this plane\u201d. A spokesperson for the Home Office declined to speak about Adoboli\u2019s case, but said: \u201cAll foreign nationals who are given a custodial sentence will be considered for removal.

      "bodyText": "Stock market returns since Lehman\u2019s collapse Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008, prompting a fall in the FTSE 100 of 4%. It was the beginning of a slump that by Christmas of that year had resulted in 23.4% being wiped off the value of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies. As a stock market crash, it ranks alongside the dotcom bubble and the shock of 1987, says the analyst Laith Khalaf of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown. However, while living standardshave flatlined since that date, the stock market revival has been nothing short of spectacular. An investment of \u00a310,000 in the FTSE All-share index in August 2008, before the Lehman crash, would now be worth \u00a314,893, without including dividends, and \u00a321,352 with dividends reinvested. The US markets have gained even more. A \u00a310,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 in September 2008 would now be worth nearly \u00a340,000, with dividends reinvested. That phenomenal performance is partly down to the rise in value of the Faang stocks \u2013 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2013 and also helped by the weaker pound boosting returns for UK investors. Best performing shares in the FTSE 100 since Lehman London Stock Exchange Group + 545% Intercontinental Hotels +515% Fashion chain Next, Costa coffee and Premier Inn group Whitbread and Sky TV are all up more than 200% Worst performing shares from FTSE 100 when Lehman collapsed Lonmin (mining business, extracting platinum in South Africa) -99.8% Royal Bank of Scotland -89.7% Lloyds Banking Group, Thomas Cook, outsourcing firm Capita and transport firm First Group are all still down more than 50% UK recession and recovery Economic output fell by 6.1% after the crash and it took 21 quarters for GDP to return to pre-crisis levels, according to ONS data. Real wages are still below pre-crisis levels. In September 2008, regular pay stood at \u00a3465 a week, compared with \u00a3461 today when inflation is taken into account. It dipped to \u00a3442 per week in March 2014, also according to figures from the ONS. Employment, though, has soared in the last 10 years and unemployment has dropped to lows not seen since 1975. Following the 2008-09 recession the unemployment rate rose to 8.5% but has now receded to 4% \u2013 the lowest level for 43 years. Pension black holes Low interest rates and the Bank of England\u2019s quantitative easing programme have driven down the interest rates pension funds can earn over the long term. The 10-year gilt yield, which is a proxy for the interest rate paid on government bonds, fell from 4.5% before the collapse of Lehman to around 3% in the aftermath, then fell back to below 2% during the eurozone debt crisis, then to a little over 0.5% after the Brexit vote. Pension liabilities, which are the long-term costs faced by a retirement plan, rise as gilt yields fall. So while lower interest payments on government debt is good for the Treasury, pension funds found their deficits widening. The 10-year gilt is now 1.49%. House prices Like share prices, house prices dipped following the crash only to recover in most parts of the country \u2013 and spectacularly in London. In September 2007 the average UK house price was \u00a3190,032. By March 2009 it was \u00a3154,452, according to ONS/HM Land Resistry data. The average house price is now \u00a3228,384. The strongest growth has been in the capital, the east and the south-east of England. Prices in Northern Ireland and the north-east are still below September 2007 levels. A lost decade for savers Huge sums have poured into savings accounts since the crash. Unfortunately the low interest rates adopted to help the economy mean the average interest paid on deposit accounts has slumped from 3.1% in 2008 to 0.43%, according to Bank of England figures. Many accounts pay no interest at all and the sums in these has swollen from \u00a348bn in September 2008 to \u00a3164bn today. A sum of \u00a310,000 held on deposit for the last 10 years would now be worth \u00a310,852 \u2013 or \u00a38,790 when inflation is taken into account. All figures supplied by Hargreaves Lansdown",

      "bodyText": "The publisher of the Mirror and Express newspapers is to axe 70 staff and shut weekly celebrity magazine Star, as the new owner of Richard Desmond\u2019s national titles makes tens of millions in cost cuts. Reach, the name adopted by Trinity Mirror after completing the \u00a3200m takeover of the Express and the Star titles and OK! magazine earlier this year, will inform staff of the cuts on Wednesday. Staff are to be told that those affected will be subject to a 45-day consultation period, which typically means that more than 100 roles are affected. However, it is understood the number being made redundant is 70. Reach is also shutting weekly celebrity magazine Star as part of its cost cutting drive. Reach said since the takeover the eight national titles had begun to pool staff and editorial resources, after a successful trial with sports. Editorial initiatives include an \u201cinternal content feed\u201d serving all titles to provide coverage, wherever possible, of non-exclusive events of the day, and increased sharing of back-of-the-book content - for example, book and film reviews. \u201cOur sports desks have been collaborating very effectively in recent weeks, which gives us confidence that our plans to share other content will work well,\u201d said a spokesman for Reach. \u201cThe crossover readership between the titles is very low. The aim is to retain as much resource as possible in areas such as politics, exclusive story-breaking, investigations and columnists, which differentiate each of our titles and give them their distinctive character.\u201d The company expects to make \u00a320m in savings by 2020 after the takeover, with \u00a312m of that coming from cuts to editorial staff and pooling of content and resources across the titles. Simon Fox, the chief executive of Reach, has pledged that the national newspaper titles, which are at opposite ends of the political spectrum, will remain editorially independent. \u201cThe Mirror is not going to go rightwing and the Express is not going to go leftwing,\u201d Fox told the Guardian in February. \u201cThey will absolutely all have editorial independence.\u201d The editors of the four Northern &amp; Shell national titles have left since the deal was completed. The job cuts do not affect staff at Reach\u2019s regional newspaper arm, the UK\u2019s biggest publisher of local titles, which include the Manchester Evening News, Birmingham Mail and Liverpool Echo. In July, Reach reported a first-half loss of \u00a3100m after writing down the value of its portfolio of 160 local newspapers and websites by \u00a3150m. The move reflected the tough outlook for local titles in the digital era.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The energy company SSE has issued a profit warning, blaming the looming price cap on the industry\u2019s poor-value default tariffs, the hot weather and higher gas prices. In an unscheduled trading update, the firm, one of the UK\u2019s big six energy suppliers, said adjusted operating profits at its household supply business would be significantly lower next year, if the industry regulator\u2019s proposed cap is implemented on 1 January. More than 11m households will have their energy bills cut by about \u00a375 a year under the cap. The overall saving from capping household bills at \u00a31,136 a year is expected to be about \u00a31bn, which would largely wipe out combined profits of \u00a3924m made by the big six energy companies last year. Shares fell nearly 9% after SSE said it had already taken a \u00a3190m hit on adjusted operating profit in the first five months of its financial year. It blamed higher than expected gas prices and other commodity price changes, as well as the long spell of dry, warm weather, which discouraged customers from using their heating. A lack of wind and rain has also resulted in lower than expected output from renewables. As a result, SSE profits in the six months to 30 September will be around \u00a3293m, half of the \u00a3586m achieved last year. The company noted that unlike other suppliers, it had raised its household prices only once this year. Alistair Phillips-Davies, its chief executive, said: \u201cLower than expected output of renewable energy and higher than expected gas prices mean that SSE\u2019s financial performance in the first five months has been disappointing and regrettable.\u201d He said the firm\u2019s \u00a31.7bn investment in regulated networks and renewables had gone well and welcomed the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s provisional backing for the merger of SSE\u2019s retail arm with npower. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u201cIt is very rare to see a profit warning from a utility company as they are meant to have fairly predictable income streams. Yet SSE bucks the trend because of the wrong type of weather.\u201d George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, added: \u201cHardly any rain or wind meant output from its hydro and wind assets wilted in the heat, and with nobody putting the heating on, customer meters just didn\u2019t tick over. All the while, the price of gas in the wholesale market has kept on rising. \u201cInvestors should remember that SSE can\u2019t control any of these factors and a business increasingly focused on renewable energy will have good years and bad. With that longer-term outlook in mind, the board says it intends to stick to pre-existing dividend plans.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "What became of the G20 leaders who met in 2008 to avert financial crisis?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 the G20 called an emergency meeting in Washington in a bid to contain the fallout from the mounting financial crisis. In the decade since each nation represented has had diverging fortunes. Of the world leaders who attended the summit, only two are still in position today \u2013 Angela Merkel and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. One is in prison and four others have become embroiled in corruption charges. Here we look at the global ramifications of the crash for those present and the countries or organisations they represented. Gabriel Sterne, head of global macro research at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the divergence across economies that is so striking. GDP did not even shrink in several Asian economies [compared to Europe]. Spain only surpassed the pre-crisis peak last year, Italy has not done so yet, and as for Greece \u2026 don\u2019t even mention Greece!\u201d Silvio Berlusconi (Italy) The eurozone\u2019s third largest nation is the only nation at the G20 where the economy remains smaller than before the financial crisis. It has had a decade of sluggish recovery marred by continuing concerns about the stability of its banks and political unrest. Berlusconi resigned in 2011 at the height of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis, and there have been five prime ministers since. Berlusconi made a comeback in politics last year, after a conviction for tax fraud, sex scandals and heart surgery. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso (European commission) The head of the European commission had to fight to keep the eurozone together in the face of the sovereign debt crisis across the single currency bloc. He stepped down in 2014 \u2013 and then controversially took a position with US investment bank Goldman Sachs. Gordon Brown (UK) Key to forming the G20 and orchestrating the international response to Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy, Brown hosted the April 2009 London summit after the first meeting in Washington. Brown lost Labour\u2019s majority at the 2010 election and was replaced by David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The Tories used the banking crash to their advantage, blaming the recession and ballooning UK budget deficit on profligate Labour spending and lax regulation. Brown quit as party leader, and stood down from parliament in 2015. The UK flirted with double-dip recession as the coalition imposed austerity to cut the deficit, rather than stimulating the economy \u2013 which some economists blame for the slow pace of recovery from the crash. Britain was one of the slowest nations in the G20 to return GDP back to pre-crisis levels. Workers\u2019 pay is still below its pre-Lehman peak. Angela Merkel (Germany) The longest-serving head of government in the EU and de-facto leader of the bloc is the only G20 leader in the same position a decade after Lehman. She has faced sharp criticism for promoting austerity measures and for the tough conditions attached to the Greek bailout. Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero (Spain) Spain is not a formal member of the G20 but has \u201cpermanent guest\u201d status, despite having the sixth-largest economy in Europe. The eurozone sovereign debt crisis, a property market crash and Spain\u2019s inability to save its banks without EU support triggered recession, extreme levels of unemployment and the use of austerity measures. Zapatero\u2019s socialists lost the 2011 election to Mariano Rajoy\u2019s conservative People\u2019s party. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan (Turkey) Alongside Merkel, the Turkish political strongman is one of few from the Washington meeting still in power. He became president in 2014, and scrapped his former post of prime minister after a referendum this year. He survived a coup attempt in 2016 and cracked down on opponents. Turkey has been one of the best-performing economies in the G20, yet much was underpinned by increasing debt levels. The country now faces an unfolding economic crisis from a plunging currency and rising borrowing costs. Manmohan Singh (India) India has one of the fastest growing economies in the world, propelled by rapid population growth, increasing urbanisation and hi-tech industrial development. Manhoman Singh, an economist, served as prime minister until 2014 when his Congress party was defeated by Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party. Stephen Harper (Canada) Canada weathered the financial crisis comparatively well, although it was still badly hit by the worldwide recession which followed. No financial institution failed and the governor of the Bank of Canada at the time, Mark Carney, was hired as governor of the Bank of England. Harper\u2019s conservatives were defeated by Justin Trudeau\u2019s liberal party in 2015. Kevin Rudd (Australia) The only developed nation from the G20 where there was no recession following the demise of Lehman Brothers, Australia was insulated by its position as a commodity exporter to fast-growing China. Kevin Rudd was deposed by his deputy, Julia Gillard, in 2010. Rudd then replaced Gillard in 2013 but lost an election three months later to Tony Abbott\u2019s liberals. Two more prime ministers have followed. Taro Aso (Japan) Still in power, but with a changed remit. Taro Aso was replaced by the democratic party\u2019s Yukio Hatoyama in late 2009. When Shinzo Abe returned won power for his liberal democrats in 2012, he appointed Aso as deputy prime minister and minister of finance. The Japanese economy has struggled with stagnation for decades, facing challenges from an aging population and the highest level of government debt in the world. Abe has used quantitative easing to try to stimulate growth. Robert Zoellick (World Bank) The World Bank \u2013 the institution charged with aiding developing nations \u2013 was at the meeting for fear the crisis would spill over to hit emerging markets, which was the case for some countries. Zoellick was replaced by Jim Yong Kim in 2012. Dominique Strauss-Kahn (IMF) Disgraced amid accusations of sexual assault against a hotel maid in New York, which were later settled out of court, Strauss-Kahn stood down from the IMF in 2011. He was replaced by Christine Lagarde. He also faced accusations of aggravated pimping, for which he was acquitted in 2015. Jan Kees de Jager (Netherlands) With a sizeable financial system, the Netherlands was a guest at the Washington meeting. The Dutch had to bail out ING bank and part of ABN Amro after its disastrous takeover by the UK\u2019s RBS. De Jager attended in place of prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende, whose father had just died. He is now chief financial officer of telecoms company KPN. Dmitry Medvedev (Russia) Russia was hit by the financial crisis, although not as badly as some other G20 nations, and staged a sharp recovery until around 2014. The economy has since suffered amid US and European economic sanctions over its annexation of Crimea. Medvedev had replaced Vladimir Putin as president in 2008 when Putin faced term limits. He then stood aside in 2012, allowing for Putin\u2019s return. He is now the Russian prime minister. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner (Argentina) Argentina has had a difficult decade since the financial crisis, including a sovereign debt default in 2014. Kirchner was replaced by Mauricio Macri after elections in 2015 and is to face trial over an alleged cover-up of Iranian involvement in the bombing of a Jewish community centre. Argentina meanwhile faces a new economic crisis from a falling currency and high debt levels. It has asked for $50bn in emergency support from the International Monetary Fund. Felipe Calder\u00f3n (Mexico) Calder\u00f3n took office around the start of the Mexican drug war in 2006, which is ongoing. The country experienced a sharp downturn after the financial crisis, before staging a robust recovery. He stood down in 2012, replaced by Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Mexico faces challenges from Donald Trump imposing import tariffs and pushing US firms to move more jobs back to America. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (Indonesia) Relatively insulated from the crash, Indonesia was one of the few G20 countries that did not see its GDP fall following the collapse of Lehman. Yudhoyono stood down in 2014. Indonesia now faces problems with a plunging currency and high levels of debt as emerging market economies around the world struggle with the stronger US dollar. Luiz Lula da Silva (Brazil) Imprisoned for corruption and money laundering for 12 years in April, Lula is among several of the G20 leaders marred by scandal in the decade since Lehman\u2019s collapse. He was succeeded in 2011 by his former chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, who was then impeached as the country lurched through accusations of corruption across politics. The Brazilian economy has since performed poorly in the decade following the crash. George W Bush (US) Government support for the banking industry was anathema to the Republican president as Lehman was allowed to fail. Politicians around the world however quickly realised they could not ignore the panic it triggered, including Bush, who signed into law a $700bn bailout for the US banks in October 2008. Barack Obama won the 2008 election, replacing Bush in January 2009 amid recession from the financial crash. Obama unleashed a stimulus package worth about $1.4tn in tax cuts, spending and other measures to avert a damaging and slow recovery from the crash. Hu Jintao (China) The strongest-performing economy in the G20 in the decade since the financial crisis, China saw rapid growth in the years immediately after the crash, with the growth rate peaking above 10% in 2010. The period since has been focused on managing the gradual slowdown of the economy as it transitions towards becoming a developed market, with a greater focus on services. Hu was replaced by Xi Jinping in 2012. However there are growing concerns over high levels of Chinese corporate debt, which some economists fear could trigger the next global financial crisis, as well as the threat of trade tariffs from Donald Trump. King Abdullah (Saudi Arabia) The oil-rich kingdom saw no drop in real GDP below its peak achieved before the financial crisis, amid continuing demand for natural resources in China, India and other emerging market economies. Abdullah died in 2015 and was succeeded by his half-brother Salman. Nicolas Sarkozy (France) Another G20 world leader tainted by corruption allegations in the past decade, Sarkozy was beaten by socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in the 2012 French elections. He faces charges for corruption and influence peddling, and investigations for donations from the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi \u2013 allegations he has said are \u201ccrazy\u201d. France has experienced sluggish growth since the crisis and unemployment remains high although growth returned last year. Centrist Emmanuel Macron\u2019s new En Marche party defeated far-right leader Marine Le Pen last year. Lee Myung-bak (South Korea) A former Hyundai executive nicknamed \u201cthe bulldozer\u201d, he used typically Keynesian economic stimulus from a construction programme in 2009 to avert a worse recession. South Korea needed to provide loan guarantees to support its banking system and was hardest hit of the major Asian economies. Lee was succeeded by Park Geun-hye in 2013. He was arrested on charges of bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion earlier this year. Kgalema Motlanthe (South Africa) South Africa fell into recession for the first time since the end of apartheid, even though the country was benefiting from a construction boom ahead of the 2010 World Cup, with the loss of millions of jobs. Motlanthe was succeeded by Jacob Zuma in 2009. South Africa is still suffering from high unemployment, while the rand has fallen this year as emerging market nations come under pressure from the rising US dollar.",

      "body": "<p>In the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 the G20 called an emergency meeting in Washington in a bid to contain the fallout from the mounting financial crisis. In the decade since each nation represented has had diverging fortunes.</p> <p>Of the world leaders who attended the summit, only two are still in position today \u2013 Angela Merkel and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. One is in prison and four others have become embroiled in corruption charges. Here we look at the global ramifications of the crash for those present and the countries or organisations they represented.</p> <p>Gabriel Sterne, head of global macro research at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the divergence across economies that is so striking. GDP did not even shrink in several Asian economies [compared to Europe]. Spain only surpassed the pre-crisis peak last year, Italy has not done so yet, and as for Greece \u2026 don\u2019t even mention Greece!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/09/g20-zip/giv-39027Rv9Iy6SXVUV/\" data-alt=\"world leaders\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/09/g20-zip/giv-39027Rv9Iy6SXVUV/\">world leaders</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Silvio Berlusconi (Italy)<br></strong>The eurozone\u2019s third largest nation is the only nation at the G20 where the economy remains smaller than before the financial crisis. It has had a decade of sluggish recovery marred by continuing concerns about the stability of its banks and political unrest.</p> <p>Berlusconi resigned in 2011 at the height of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis, and there have been five prime ministers since. Berlusconi made a comeback in politics last year, after a conviction for tax fraud, sex scandals and heart surgery.</p> <p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso (European </strong><strong>commission)<br></strong>The head of the European commission had to fight to keep the eurozone together in the face of the sovereign debt crisis across the single currency bloc. He stepped down in 2014 \u2013 and then controversially took a position with US investment bank Goldman Sachs.</p> <p><strong>Gordon Brown (UK)<br></strong>Key to forming the G20 and orchestrating the international response to Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy, Brown hosted the April 2009 London summit after the first meeting in Washington.</p> <p>Brown lost Labour\u2019s majority at the 2010 election and was replaced by David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The Tories used the banking crash to their advantage, blaming the recession and ballooning UK budget deficit on profligate Labour spending and lax regulation. Brown quit as party leader, and stood down from parliament in 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/09/archive-zip/giv-3902SrhqfTmP1Abu/\" data-alt=\"growth since crisis\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/09/archive-zip/giv-3902SrhqfTmP1Abu/\">growth since crisis</a> </figure>  <p>The UK flirted with double-dip recession as the coalition imposed austerity to cut the deficit, rather than stimulating the economy \u2013 which some economists blame for the slow pace of recovery from the crash. Britain was one of the slowest nations in the G20 to return GDP back to pre-crisis levels. Workers\u2019 pay is still below its pre-Lehman peak.</p> <p><strong>Angela Merkel (Germany)<br></strong>The longest-serving head of government in the EU and de-facto leader of the bloc is the only G20 leader in the same position a decade after Lehman. She has faced sharp criticism for promoting austerity measures and for the tough conditions attached to the Greek bailout.</p> <p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero (Spain)<br></strong>Spain is not a formal member of the G20 but has \u201cpermanent guest\u201d status, despite having the sixth-largest economy in Europe. </p> <p>The eurozone sovereign debt crisis, a property market crash and Spain\u2019s inability to save its banks without EU support triggered recession, extreme levels of unemployment and the use of austerity measures.</p> <p>Zapatero\u2019s socialists lost the 2011 election to Mariano Rajoy\u2019s conservative People\u2019s party.</p> <p><strong>Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan (Turkey)<br></strong>Alongside Merkel, the Turkish political strongman is one of few from the Washington meeting still in power. He became president in 2014, and scrapped his former post of prime minister after a referendum this year. He survived a coup attempt in 2016 and cracked down on opponents.</p> <p>Turkey has been one of the best-performing economies in the G20, yet much was underpinned by increasing debt levels. The country now faces an unfolding economic crisis from a plunging currency and rising borrowing costs.</p> <p><strong>Manmohan Singh (India)<br></strong>India has one of the fastest growing economies in the world, propelled by rapid population growth, increasing urbanisation and hi-tech industrial development.</p> <p>Manhoman Singh, an economist, served as prime minister until 2014 when his Congress party was defeated by Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Harper (Canada)<br></strong>Canada weathered the financial crisis comparatively well, although it was still badly hit by the worldwide recession which followed. No financial institution failed and the governor of the Bank of Canada at the time, Mark Carney, was hired as governor of the Bank of England.</p> <p>Harper\u2019s conservatives were defeated by Justin Trudeau\u2019s liberal party in 2015.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Rudd (Australia)<br></strong>The only developed nation from the G20 where there was no recession following the demise of Lehman Brothers, Australia was insulated by its position as a commodity exporter to fast-growing China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/09/archive-zip/giv-3902pD3QfRf19rDf/\" data-alt=\"years to recover\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/09/archive-zip/giv-3902pD3QfRf19rDf/\">years to recover</a> </figure>  <p>Kevin Rudd was deposed by his deputy, Julia Gillard, in 2010. Rudd then replaced Gillard in 2013 but lost an election three months later to Tony Abbott\u2019s liberals. Two more prime ministers have followed.</p> <p><strong>Taro Aso (Japan)<br></strong>Still in power, but with a changed remit. Taro Aso was replaced by the democratic party\u2019s Yukio Hatoyama in late 2009. When Shinzo Abe returned won power for his liberal democrats in 2012, he appointed Aso as deputy prime minister and minister of finance.</p> <p>The Japanese economy has struggled with stagnation for decades, facing challenges from an aging population and the highest level of government debt in the world. Abe has used quantitative easing to try to stimulate growth.</p> <p><strong>Robert Zoellick (World Bank)<br></strong>The World Bank \u2013 the institution charged with aiding developing nations \u2013 was at the meeting for fear the crisis would spill over to hit emerging markets, which was the case for some countries. Zoellick was replaced by Jim Yong Kim in 2012.</p> <p><strong>Dominique Strauss-Kahn (IMF)<br></strong>Disgraced amid accusations of sexual assault against a hotel maid in New York, which were later settled out of court, Strauss-Kahn stood down from the IMF in 2011. He was replaced by Christine Lagarde. He also faced accusations of aggravated pimping, for which he was acquitted in 2015.</p> <p><strong>Jan Kees de Jager (Netherlands)<br></strong>With a sizeable financial system, the Netherlands was a guest at the Washington meeting. The Dutch had to bail out ING bank and part of ABN Amro after its disastrous takeover by the UK\u2019s RBS. De Jager attended in place of prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende, whose father had just died. He is now chief financial officer of telecoms company KPN.</p> <p><strong>Dmitry Medvedev (Russia)<br></strong>Russia was hit by the financial crisis, although not as badly as some other G20 nations, and staged a sharp recovery until around 2014. The economy has since suffered amid US and European economic sanctions over its annexation of Crimea.</p> <p>Medvedev had replaced Vladimir Putin as president in 2008 when Putin faced term limits. He then stood aside in 2012, allowing for Putin\u2019s return. He is now the Russian prime minister.</p> <p><strong>Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner (Argentina)<br></strong>Argentina has had a difficult decade since the financial crisis, including a sovereign debt default in 2014. Kirchner was replaced by Mauricio Macri after elections in 2015 and is to face trial over an alleged cover-up of Iranian involvement in the bombing of a Jewish community centre.</p> <p>Argentina meanwhile faces a new economic crisis from a falling currency and high debt levels. It has asked for $50bn in emergency support from the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p><strong>Felipe Calder\u00f3n (Mexico)<br></strong>Calder\u00f3n took office around the start of the Mexican drug war in 2006, which is ongoing. The country experienced a sharp downturn after the financial crisis, before staging a robust recovery. He stood down in 2012, replaced by Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.</p> <p>Mexico faces challenges from Donald Trump imposing import tariffs and pushing US firms to move more jobs back to America.</p> <p><strong>Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (Indonesia)<br></strong>Relatively insulated from the crash, Indonesia was one of the few G20 countries that did not see its GDP fall following the collapse of Lehman. Yudhoyono stood down in 2014.</p> <p>Indonesia now faces problems with a plunging currency and high levels of debt as emerging market economies around the world struggle with the stronger US dollar.</p> <p><strong>Luiz Lula da Silva (Brazil)<br></strong>Imprisoned for corruption and money laundering for 12 years in April, Lula is among several of the G20 leaders marred by scandal in the decade since Lehman\u2019s collapse. He was succeeded in 2011 by his former chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, who was then impeached as the country lurched through accusations of corruption across politics.</p> <p>The Brazilian economy has since performed poorly in the decade following the crash.</p> <p><strong>George W</strong><strong> Bush (US)<br></strong>Government support for the banking industry was anathema to the Republican president as Lehman was allowed to fail. Politicians around the world however quickly realised they could not ignore the panic it triggered, including Bush, who signed into law a $700bn bailout for the US banks in October 2008.</p> <p>Barack Obama won the 2008 election, replacing Bush in January 2009 amid recession from the financial crash. Obama unleashed a stimulus package worth about $1.4tn in tax cuts, spending and other measures to avert a damaging and slow recovery from the crash.</p> <p><strong>Hu Jintao (China)<br></strong>The strongest-performing economy in the G20 in the decade since the financial crisis, China saw rapid growth in the years immediately after the crash, with the growth rate peaking above 10% in 2010.</p> <p>The period since has been focused on managing the gradual slowdown of the economy as it transitions towards becoming a developed market, with a greater focus on services. Hu was replaced by Xi Jinping in 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/09/frontrunners-zip/giv-3902EiLXN4rS8HZG/\" data-alt=\"never in recession\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/09/frontrunners-zip/giv-3902EiLXN4rS8HZG/\">never in recession</a> </figure>  <p>However there are growing concerns over high levels of Chinese corporate debt, which some economists fear could trigger the next global financial crisis, as well as the threat of trade tariffs from Donald Trump.</p> <p><strong>King Abdullah (Saudi Arabia)<br></strong>The oil-rich kingdom saw no drop in real GDP below its peak achieved before the financial crisis, amid continuing demand for natural resources in China, India and other emerging market economies. Abdullah died in 2015 and was succeeded by his half-brother Salman.</p> <p><strong>Nicolas Sarkozy (France)<br></strong>Another G20 world leader tainted by corruption allegations in the past decade, Sarkozy was beaten by socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in the 2012 French elections. He faces charges for corruption and influence peddling, and investigations for donations from the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi \u2013 allegations he has said are \u201ccrazy\u201d.</p> <p>France has experienced sluggish growth since the crisis and unemployment remains high although growth returned last year. Centrist Emmanuel Macron\u2019s new En Marche party defeated far-right leader Marine Le Pen last year.</p> <p><strong>Lee Myung-bak (South Korea)<br></strong>A former Hyundai executive nicknamed \u201cthe bulldozer\u201d, he used typically Keynesian economic stimulus from a construction programme in 2009 to avert a worse recession. South Korea needed to provide loan guarantees to support its banking system and was hardest hit of the major Asian economies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lee was succeeded by Park Geun-hye in 2013. He was arrested on charges of bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion earlier this year.</p> <p><strong>Kgalema Motlanthe (South Africa)<br></strong>South Africa fell into recession for the first time since the end of apartheid, even though the country was benefiting from a construction boom ahead of the 2010 World Cup, with the loss of millions of jobs.</p> <p>Motlanthe was succeeded by Jacob Zuma in 2009. South Africa is still suffering from high unemployment, while the rand has fallen this year as emerging market nations come under pressure from the rising US dollar. <br></p>",
