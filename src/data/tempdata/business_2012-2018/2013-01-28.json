      "bodyText": "For the first time since last April, Wall Street bond investors are seeing the economic glass as half-full. Interest rates on Treasury bonds have been rising slowly and subtly over the past week \u2013 and that may indicate that Wall Street believes the economy is finally going in the right direction. There are reasons for their optimism. Economic numbers, particularly around housing and to a lesser extent around unemployment, have been improving steadily. Congress decided, uncharacteristically, not to have a knock-down, drag-out fight over the debt ceiling until at least 19 May. The result: yields for 10-year Treasury bonds jumped to over 2% Monday for the first time since April 2012. The jump signals that, at least temporarily, Wall Street may believe that the recovery has accelerated, so they don't need to pile into Treasury bonds. Michael Pond, interest-rate strategist at Barclays Capital, said that selling Treasury bonds is not Wall Street's way of disapproving of the better economic news. \"Everyone, everyone wants the recovery to accelerate,\" said Pond. Treasury yields are not exactly the most exciting subject in the world, for good reason: yields have been so low for so long that they have rarely budged to reflect any difference in economic conditions. But Treasury yields are also a way of reading the US economy. Mortgage rates, for instance, are often related to the 10-year Treasury bond. Mortgage rates have been at record lows because the 10-year Treasury has also been at record lows. Because Treasury rates are rising, \"I would expect mortgage rates to rise,\" said Guy LeBas, a portfolio manager with Janney Montgomery Scott. Treasury yields have been very low for two reasons. The first is demand: the Federal Reserve controls the Treasury market and has a huge influence over prices, which it wants to keep low. The Fed is the largest owner and the largest buyer of Treasury bonds. It holds $1.7tn in US government debt, nearly double the amount it did three years ago. Part of the Fed's rationale in keeping Treasury yields low is to encourage investors who would buy bonds to avoid Treasuries and move to corporate bonds instead, where companies could use the cash. The Fed also wants to keep rates low to encourage consumers to spend money. The mechanics of Treasury bonds are a little complex. Treasury bonds are considered the safest kind of investment because they are backed by the federal government, which guarantees they will be paid. So when investors are worried about risk, they run to the safest investment possible: treasuries. When investors sell their treasuries, it means they perceive there is less risk in the US economy and that things are getting better. A lot of things could happen to change that perception, of course \u2013 anything from Washington dysfunction to bad economic news \u2013 but for the time being, let's enjoy the rare pause in nonstop disaster and crisis.",

Not this time. The current account deficit in 2012 was higher than it was in 2007. Britain's poor record in exporting to the fast-growing economies of the developing world is said to be the reason for this weak performance. That's wrong, according to Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform thinktank. He says exports to non-EU markets have been growing fast, up 65% for goods and 35% for services between 2006 and 2012. It is trade with the EU that has been the problem, with exports of goods falling by 5% and services exports rising by 23% over the same six-year period. Britain runs a current account deficit of 4.5% with the EU and a surplus with the rest of the world. The outlook for exports to the UK is not going to change any time soon and if the government is banking on the EU to help rebalance the economy it needs to think again. Britain's economy will remain flat as a pancake unless action is taken to stimulate domestic demand. That would, of course, mean that the trade deficit would widen but that in turn would lead to a cheaper pound and further boost exports to non-EU countries.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If the high street is beginning to look like a horror movie, then Hilco could be cast as the vampire. The restructuring specialist has made millions by sucking up the assets of dying brands including Woolworths, Habitat and Borders. Founder Paul McGowan, his partner Andrew Pepper and Hilco's US parent company shared a \u00a39.7m dividend in 2011, on top of \u00a322m the year before. The business has thrived during the downturn, clearing stock from stores set for closure, winning advisory fees on the management of ailing chains, trading in the debt of distressed companies and restructuring them for sale. Now HMV is firmly in Hilco's grip. Hilco bought HMV's \u00a3176m of debt last week for a reported \u00a340m, giving it control over the retailer's future. Around half of HMV's 223 stores are expected to close while Hilco has the backing of major film and music companies to run a downsized chain. A buy-out deal is expected once property experts size up which stores could be sold off at a profit and which will remain part of HMV. Hilco is also said to be interested in buying the Jessops brand and website after all the collapsed camera retailer's stores were closed. Maureen Hinton at the retail market analyst Verdict said: \"Hilco seems very good at getting the best out of struggling businesses because it's got good retail experience.\" Administrators claimed it has a broad range of experts backed up by a strong capital base that allows them to buy up debt or stock or invest in extras, such as new IT systems, which can produce the best results. McGowan, who set up Hilco's UK division in 2000 with the former Harrods boss Paul Taylor, has some operational credentials, having run the UK arm of womenswear retailer Leslie Fay in the early 1990s. He learned how to handle a retail closure the hard way when the US parent pulled out of the UK in 1996. His right hand man Pepper was previously at Kroll, which handled the wind-down of MVC, the music and video retailer. That gave him an invaluable insight into the entertainment market and contacts with suppliers which continue to pay dividends. The pair's strong track record in finding cash for debt holders has made Hilco first choice for retail administrators and enabled the British division to spread into Ireland, Germany, South Africa and Spain. Last year it was brought in to clear stock and close stores at Clinton Cards, JJB Sports and the Allders department store in Croydon. It also advised on the administration of the fashion chain Peacocks and the closure of Micro Anvika's electronics stores. An investor who has worked closely with Hilco said a core skill was accurately valuing stock, partly because one of its bread-and-butter services is assessing stock for insurance purposes. It also buys up unwanted stock to sell on elsewhere. \"It gives them a good feel for the market,\" he said. But it's not all about wind-downs. Hilco's experience in operating retail businesses puts it ahead of rivals such as Gordon Brother and GA Europe. It has re-jigged and sold on businesses including Habitat, whose UK website and main stores were sold to Home Retail Group, the owner of Homebase for \u00a324m, while stores in France, Germany and Spain were sold to the French furniture conglomerate Cafom for \u00a39m. Valco Capital Partners, Hilco's investment arm, has also been busy. It bought the pottery manufacturer Denby for \u00a330m in 2009 and continues to run it, adding earthenware firm Burleigh in 2010 and Somerset-based Poole Pottery in 2011. Denby returned to profitability in 2011 as turnover rose 9% to \u00a340.3m, according to accounts filed at Companies House. More relevant to the 4,000 staff at HMV wondering about their futures is HMV Canada. Valco bought the 120-store chain in 2011 for \u00a32m, renegotiated rents at unprofitable outlets and closed several stores. It is now profitable before interest, tax and depreciation charges, and looking to expand again. The chain recorded an increase in sales of 1.4% over Christmas to C$65.4m (\u00a341.4m) after it abandoned low-margin computer games and iPod docks in favour of more profitable T-shirts and coffee mugs branded with band names. One executive who has worked closely with ailing businesses said: \"People think Hilco does a hatchet job, but they have traded HMV Canada and traded it well. They have won a lot of credibility because of that.\" In Canada, HMV has benefited from a slower move to digital music and a different competitive environment. Its relative success suggests hope for the UK chain, but it's not clear how long a life the business may have. Major suppliers including music labels Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony have shown they are keen to support a high street store and a rival to the supermarkets and online giant Amazon. Nevertheless downloads are superceding CDs and DVDs at a rapid rate, and even physical products are easily posted to shoppers' homes. Hinton said: \"Hilco is not really into reviving businesses but getting the best value out of them while they can. HMV and Jessops are clearly not going to last forever but Hilco are good at managing decline and exits.\" She sees Hilco less as a vampire and more as a hospice nurse tending patients through their last days. Those last days may not always be comfortable for store staff. One banker points out Hilco will look at the assets of a retailer and often come up with a fresh angle. At Allied Carpets, Hilco took on around 50 stores in 2009, closed about half and sold the rest on to a management buyout. The chain later fell into administration. Valco pulled out the lucrative insurance business by backing a separate management buyout. That business cut its losses from \u00a3653,080 in 2010 to \u00a388,439 in 2011 while turnover remained steady at \u00a316.4m. Other retailers have passed through Hilco's hands only to limp into administration later on. Clothes chain Ethel Austin, home furnishings stores Texstyle World and menswear group Ciro Citterio all subsequently hit trouble, although their problems occurred some time after Hilco's involvement. Valco also bought the Borders, the books and entertainment chain in 2009, only to close all its branches and put it into administration four months later. Valco reportedly took home \u00a38m as it owned the secured debt, but publishers were left out of pocket. Allders was also controversial. Hilco was part of a consortium that bought the retailer's debt at 26p in the pound. Following its first fall into administration in 2005, the consortium reportedly got back 90p in the pound. A very savvy deal, but it attracted controversy given the business's \u00a315m pension fund deficit at the time of its collapse. As HMV and Jessops staff wait to hear their fate, the shopworkers' union Usdaw says it hopes Hilco has \"a business plan to secure the future of the brand and as many stores and jobs as possible\". It's still not clear if Hilco is planning to send in nurses or vampires. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 January to correct the 2011 dividend to \u00a39.7m from \u00a397m",

A buy-out deal is expected once property experts size up which stores could be sold off at a profit and which will remain part of HMV.</p> <p>Hilco is also said to be interested in buying the Jessops brand and website after all the collapsed camera retailer's stores were closed.</p> <p>Maureen Hinton at the retail market analyst Verdict said: \"Hilco seems very good at getting the best out of struggling businesses because it's got good retail experience.\"</p> <p>Administrators claimed it has a broad range of experts backed up by a strong capital base that allows them to buy up debt or stock or invest in extras, such as new IT systems, which can produce the best results.</p> <p>McGowan, who set up Hilco's UK division in 2000 with the former Harrods boss Paul Taylor, has some operational credentials, having run the UK arm of womenswear retailer Leslie Fay in the early 1990s. He learned how to handle a retail closure the hard way when the US parent pulled out of the UK in 1996.</p> <p>His right hand man Pepper was previously at Kroll, which handled the wind-down of MVC, the music and video retailer. That gave him an invaluable insight into the entertainment market and contacts with suppliers which continue to pay dividends.</p> <p>The pair's strong track record in finding cash for debt holders has made Hilco first choice for retail administrators and enabled the British division to spread into Ireland, Germany, South Africa and Spain. Last year it was brought in to clear stock and close stores at Clinton Cards, JJB Sports and the Allders department store in Croydon. It also advised on the administration of the fashion chain Peacocks and the closure of Micro Anvika's electronics stores.</p> <p>An investor who has worked closely with Hilco said a core skill was accurately valuing stock, partly because one of its bread-and-butter services is assessing stock for insurance purposes. It also buys up unwanted stock to sell on elsewhere. \"It gives them a good feel for the market,\" he said.</p> <p>But it's not all about wind-downs. Hilco's experience in operating retail businesses puts it ahead of rivals such as Gordon Brother and GA Europe. It has re-jigged and sold on businesses including Habitat, whose UK website and main stores were sold to Home Retail Group, the owner of Homebase for \u00a324m, while stores in France, Germany and Spain were sold to the French furniture conglomerate Cafom for \u00a39m.</p> <p>Valco Capital Partners, Hilco's investment arm, has also been busy. It bought the pottery manufacturer Denby for \u00a330m in 2009 and continues to run it, adding earthenware firm Burleigh in 2010 and Somerset-based Poole Pottery in 2011. Denby returned to profitability in 2011 as turnover rose 9% to \u00a340.3m, according to accounts filed at Companies House.</p> <p>More relevant to the 4,000 staff at HMV wondering about their futures is HMV Canada. Valco bought the 120-store chain in 2011 for \u00a32m, renegotiated rents at unprofitable outlets and closed several stores. It is now profitable before interest, tax and depreciation charges, and looking to expand again.</p> <p>The chain recorded an increase in sales of 1.4% over Christmas to C$65.4m (\u00a341.4m) after it abandoned low-margin computer games and iPod docks in favour of more profitable T-shirts and coffee mugs branded with band names. One executive who has worked closely with ailing businesses said: \"People think Hilco does a hatchet job, but they have traded HMV Canada and traded it well. They have won a lot of credibility because of that.\"</p> <p>In Canada, HMV has benefited from a slower move to digital music and a different competitive environment. Its relative success suggests hope for the UK chain, but it's not clear how long a life the business may have. Major suppliers including music labels Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony have shown they are keen to support a high street store and a rival to the supermarkets and online giant Amazon. Nevertheless downloads are superceding CDs and DVDs at a rapid rate, and even physical products are easily posted to shoppers' homes. Hinton said: \"Hilco is not really into reviving businesses but getting the best value out of them while they can. HMV and Jessops are clearly not going to last forever but Hilco are good at managing decline and exits.\"</p> <p>She sees Hilco less as a vampire and more as a hospice nurse tending patients through their last days. Those last days may not always be comfortable for store staff. One banker points out Hilco will look at the assets of a retailer and often come up with a fresh angle.</p> <p>At Allied Carpets, Hilco took on around 50 stores in 2009, closed about half and sold the rest on to a management buyout. The chain later fell into administration. Valco pulled out the lucrative insurance business by backing a separate management buyout. That business cut its losses from \u00a3653,080 in 2010 to \u00a388,439 in 2011 while turnover remained steady at \u00a316.4m.</p> <p>Other retailers have passed through Hilco's hands only to limp into administration later on. Clothes chain Ethel Austin, home furnishings stores Texstyle World and menswear group Ciro Citterio all subsequently hit trouble, although their problems occurred some time after Hilco's involvement.</p> <p>Valco also bought the Borders, the books and entertainment chain in 2009, only to close all its branches and put it into administration four months later. Valco reportedly took home \u00a38m as it owned the secured debt, but publishers were left out of pocket.</p> <p>Allders was also controversial. Hilco was part of a consortium that bought the retailer's debt at 26p in the pound. Following its first fall into administration in 2005, the consortium reportedly got back 90p in the pound. A very savvy deal, but it attracted controversy given the business's \u00a315m pension fund deficit at the time of its collapse.</p> <p>As HMV and Jessops staff wait to hear their fate, the shopworkers' union Usdaw says it hopes Hilco has \"a business plan to secure the future of the brand and as many stores and jobs as possible\".</p> <p>It's still not clear if Hilco is planning to send in nurses or vampires.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 January to correct the 2011 dividend to \u00a39.7m from \u00a397m</p>",

      "bodyText": "Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy is preparing a package of measures - such as tax breaks for young entrepreneurs - in an effort to boost the economy. He plans to stick to his budget cuts, according to Reuters, but will propose in an address on 20 February what a spokeswoman called a series of \"micro-policies\". These will be focused on specific sectors such as small companies. Meanwhile inspectors from the troika - the EU, IMF and ECB - are in Madrid to see whether Spain is complying with conditions set for a \u20ac40bn bailout of its banks. EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn said in Madrid that Spain's regions appeared to be in a better position to meet fiscal targets. And with that it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. European markets have closed on a mixed note, with the FTSE 100 finishing just below 6300 after earlier breaking through that barrier for the first time since mid-May 2008. \u2022 FTSE 100 closes up 9.96 points higher at 6294.41 after touching 6311 \u2022 Germany's Dax dips 0.32% \u2022 France's Cac finishes 0.07% higher \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ends up 0.96% \u2022 Spain's Ibex slips 0.6% \u2022 In Athens the marked dips 0.07% \u2022 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.12% lower On the currency market sterling contines to weaken against the dollar and euro after last week's poor GDP figures and amid talk that incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney may take more aggressive measures to boost growth. Developments in Greece where most of the striking transport workers have now ended their industrial action. Our correspondent Helena Smith writes: With the exception of bus drivers in the capital, striking transport sector workers have ended industrial action launched in support of metro workers denouncing EU-IMF dictated pay cuts. Staff operating trollies, trains and trams decided to go back to work after a public prosecutor deemed their decision to walk off the job illegal. But bus drivers said they will hold out until Tuesday \u2013 a move that will exacerbate hardship for commuters ever more dependent on public transport as the cost of fuel rises. The move followed the country\u2019s highest legal body rejecting an appeal by striking metro employees against the government\u2019s controversial use of a civil mobilisation order forcing the sector back to work last week. Meanwhile, protesting farmers (see report earlier) may still blockade the country if prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 fragile coalition did meet their demands. These include inter alia, cutting the price of fuel \u2013 which they say has sent production costs soaring. Helena adds: After holding talks with the farmers earlier today, Fotis Kouvellis who heads the ruling coalition's small Democratic Left party, gave a verbal \u201ccommitment not promise\u201d that the government would do its best to reach a solution. In Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s northern capital, worried officials announced that they would also hold emergency talks within the week to try and reach common ground. Farmers have vowed to block highways with their tractors in the event of impasse. \u201cRight now the country can\u2019t tolerate things developing in such a way,\u201d said Apostolos Tsitsikostas, the region\u2019s prefect. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow the country\u2019s economy to freeze at a time of great export activity,\u201d he added referring to the jump in exports from northern Macedonia in recent years. Northern Greece, and especially Thessaloniki, have the highest unemployment rates in the land. But the atmosphere in the port city is remarkably jolly compared to Athens with the bars and cafes along the sea front thumping with young (and presumably jobless) Greeks having a good time. Greece has scrapped a short selling ban it introduced 17 months ago \u2013 except for banking shares. The ban was introduced supposedly to protect investors in August 2011 and has been renewed several times, with the latest ban expiring at the end of this month. Such bans have proved controversial with critics questioning their purpose. Greece's securities regulator said the block would remain until April for banking shares, in view of the recapitalisation of the country's lenders. There was also talk that Spain may follow suit. Still with the US, Fitch said the temporary suspension of the debt ceiling, agreed last week, had removed the near-term risk to the country's cherished AAA rating. It said: Fitch had previously commented that failure to increase the debt ceiling in a timely manner would prompt a review of the US sovereign rating. Without the distraction of a near-term funding crisis for the federal government, Congress and the Administration have the space to focus on the substantive fiscal policy choices necessary to place public finances on a sustainable path over the medium to long-term. In August 2011 Standard and Poor's cut the US rating to AA, and the other agencies had warned about the dangers of the country not resolving its fiscal cliff and budgetary issues. Some slightly underwhelming figures out now from the US. Contracts to buy previously owned homes unexpectedly fell last month, down 4.3% compared with expectations of a 0.3% rise and a 1.7% increase in November. The National Association of Realtors put the fall down to the lack of supply \u2013 owners have been staying put rather than moving and crystalising losses on their property. But the overall housing market still appears reasonably buoyant, with the association expecting a 9% increase in sales this year, a similar figure to 2013. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The outcome [for last month's sales] is lower than expected and it confirms the 'technical' correction for all the major US housing indicators in December. The monthly decline follows three months of consecutive increases in pending home sales and it leaves the annual growth rate in comfortable positive territory. Home sales fell in all the major US regions, with the only exception of the mid-west. All in all, the report suggests that the US housing market registered a technical downward correction in December but the overall picture of upward trend is confirmed. That said, the pace of activity remains slow as there are still some constraints coming from low supply, tight credit conditions and uncertainties surrounding the economy. There's some (rare) good news out of Greece, where bank deposits rose for a fourth consecutive month in December. The Greek central bank said total deposits held by domestic residents and companies rose by \u20ac5.5bn in December to \u20ac161.4bn. Greek banks have seen deposits decline since the start of the debt crisis in 2009, as individuals and companies took out cash and transferred funds to foreign banks. But deposits started rising again last year, after the elections produced a governing coalition, giving the country some political stability even amid its economic crisis. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. While the markets might be relatively quiet today, David Buik at Cantor Index has pointed out that the FTSE100 is up by almost 7% since the start of the year. He notes: Having breached the 6,300 threshold, the FTSE 100 is up no less than 6.8% this month! \u2013 through the 6,000, 6.100, 6,200 and finally 6,300 throughout the month. Last we checked, it was up 22 points on the day at 6307 points. Not a bad run, considering. For such a small country, Cyprus is demanding plenty of attention these days. Russia's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said in an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt that Russia could provide support to Cyprus but the island state itself and the EU must take the biggest share of a bailout. Cyprus has had close political ties with Russia for decades. Medvedev said: We think the main burden to solve these problems should be taken on by Cyprus and the EU states. But we are not refusing to help under certain conditions. The conditions must be agreed first. Before that, there can be no money from us. There's some positioning going on at the Bank of England, ahead of Mark Carney's appointment as governor in July. Carney, currently governor of the Bank of Canada, hinted strongly at a new approach including the use of unconventional measures, when speaking in Davos. But today, David Miles, a member of the monetary policy committee, played down the need for a remit change. In an interview with the London Evening Standard, he said the central bank did not need to adopt the kind of longer-term guidance favoured by the Bank of Canada. I don't think it would be helfpul for the MPC to say here is where policy is going to be for the next several months. If we did that there wouldn't be any point in having monthly meetings. Carney has also been associated with the idea of a growth target for the Bank of England, rather than an inflation target. Miles said this could only ever be an emergency measure. As a temporary measure in exceptional circumstances there may be things to be said for it. I think I would need to be convinced that there were obvious advantages it gave you that you couldn't have with what I would describe as our current regime of flexible inflation targeting. There's more good news out of the US, where orders for durable goods (things like cars and televisions that last a long time) in December were much higher than expected. The headline number rose 4.6%, exceeding expectations of a 2% rise. Core capital expenditure (non-defence related capital goods orders excluding aircraft) rose 0.2% compared with expectations of a 0.4% decline. Durable goods, excluding transportation, rose 1.3%, compared with expectations of a 0.8% gain. The news will likely lift the markets as concerns about the fiscal cliff fade like a bad memory. Back to Ireland, where the question of promissory notes has re-emerged. Reuters reported over the weekend that the European Central Bank has rejected Ireland's preferred solution to a dispute over the cost of paying back the money borrowed to rescue a failed bank, citing EU sources familiar with the matter. As it stands, Dublin is due to pay \u20ac3.1bn a year until 2023, under the terms of a so-called promissory note, which is essentially a negotiable debt instrument. This was issued to underwrite Ango Irish Bank, when the main Irish banks collapsed in 2008. Reuters reports: The Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, had proposed converting the note into long-term government bonds that would be taken up by the Irish central bank with the intention of keeping the bonds in its portfolio for a long period The sources said the ECB's governing council discussed the plan for the first time at a meeting on Wednesday and Thursday and agreed that it amounted to 'monetary financing' of the Irish government, banned under article 123 of the EU treaty. 'The ball is now back in the Irish court,' one source involved in the deliberations said. 'This is an issue of principle. There is a real concern in the governing council because you can create precedents when you do things for one country. Then others may say :why not for us?\"' the source said. 'We must be sure the solution doesn't open a window in terms of monetary financing.' A spokesman for Ireland's finance department declined to comment. Officials from the central bank and government were not immediately available for comment. Dow Jones and Wall Street Journal reporter Matina Stevis says the EC is also tight-lipped about the matter. The FT has more on the Icesave case (see below), which it says was an unexpected victory. Richard Milne in Oslo and Brooke Masters in London report: The EFTA (European Free Trade Association) court on Monday dismissed all claims against Iceland, ruling that it had not breached the deposit guarantee directive due to the magnitude of the systemic crisis that Iceland experienced. It also held that Iceland had not discriminated between depositors in its own country and those in the UK or Netherlands. Iceland reacted with relief after government officials had long been prepared for a defeat. 'It is a considerable satisfaction that Iceland\u2019s defence has won the day in the Icesave case; the EFTA Court ruling brings to a close an important stage in a long saga,' the government said. Iceland did not break the law when it failed to repay British and Dutch savers in Icesave, a European court has ruled. This all goes back to 2008, when Britain and the Netherlands stepped in to refund people who had money in an online account run by one of the three Icelandic banks that collapsed. The decision vindicates the Icelandic government, which has repeatedly refused to pay the British and Dutch governments directly; instead allowing the estate of the bank, Landsbanki, to repay the amounts gradually. Now the court of the European Free Trade Association \u2013 a group with close ties to the European Union \u2013 has dismissed the case brought against Iceland for alleged failure to follow deposit protection laws. Over to Portugal, where the central bank chief said the country needs to reform its public spending model so it is more sustainable and allows \"a socially acceptable\" level of taxation. Portugal is undergoing a stinging regime of austerity, as it fights to get out of a bailout programme. Carlos Costa, who is also a member of the ECB's governing council, said the government risks trying the patience of the Portuguese people with endless reforms. We cannot ignore the risks of fatigue. But he said more needed to be done to make the public finances sustainable, and that levels of tax must be \"socially acceptable\". Reforms in public administration have not been enough to assure the sustainability of public finances. Now is the moment to correct our course. A new social contract is needed that subjects state spending to a socially acceptable tax effort. Back in Greece, anti-austerity protests are intensifying as farmers also step up strike action (see below). Our correspondent Helena Smith writes: Protesting farmers, determined to overthrow unpopular austerity policies, have begun driving their tractors onto highways pledging to cause traffic chaos if their demands aren\u2019t met. The lull Greece had enjoyed out of the news until the metro strike last week looked well and truly over this morning as farmers joined the onslaught against measures that are the price of further rescue funds from the EU and IMF. Speaking on behalf of the sector, Kostas Lioliopoulos, said farmers were being \u201ceradicated\u201d by increased taxes and higher production costs. 'The economic crisis is killing us,' he said, adding that farmers from the region of Evros in the north to Crete in the south would wreak havoc if the governing coalition did not back down. Many of the tractors are concentrated around arteries outside the central Greek town of Larissa but farmers, who will hold talks with political leaders, said they would start blocking off other highways if their demands weren\u2019t met by Wednesday. 'The country will be paralysed if there is no progress,' said Lioliopoulos, the unionist. Intensifying the strike action, rolling strikes have also been called by staff operating buses, trains and trolleys with the railway network being crippled nationwide. Doctors, nurses and ambulance workers have also said they will be walking off the job on Thursday to protest against internationally mandated funding cuts of the national health system. Taking a look at the UK, the incoming chief of the Bank of England has been making waves, with his comments that monetary policy is not yet \"maxed out\". Speaking from Davos over the weekend, Carney said: There continues to be monetary policy options in all major economies. That contrasts with outgoing governor, Mervyn King, who said last week that monetary policy cannot be a panacea for boosting economic output. The pound has been tumbling since the beginning of the year, and fell further at the end of last week after official data showed the economy contracted in the final three months of last year. Sterling dropped to its lowest in more than 10 months agasint a basked of currencies, and a near 14-month low against the euro. More bad news from Italy, with data showing consumer confidence has hit its lowest level since records began in 1996. The national statistics bureau ISTAT's headline consumer confidence index fell to 84.6 in January from 85.7 the month before. That missed all forecasts in a Reuters survey of 15 analysts, who were expecting the index to pick up to 86.0. The reading is the lowest in the seasonally-adjusted data series, which dates back to 1996, an Istat official said. A quick look at the markets, which don't know which way they are going this morning. After starting in positive territory, the FTSE turned down only to tick up again, and now it's broadly flat. UK FTSE 100: -0.02%, or 1.3 points, at 6283 France CAC 40: up 0.08% Germany DAX: up 0.1% Spain IBEX: down 0.16% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.5% Lower bank lending in the eurozone should raise concerns that companies don't want to borrow, writes Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. It is evident that the ECB\u2019s decision to cut its deposit rate to zero from 0.25% last July has done little to encourage banks to lend more to the private sector. In part, the weakness in lending undoubtedly stems from low demand from the non-financial private sector. This has been reflected in survey evidence showing that households and firms are reluctant to take on new debt amid weak economic activity levels and still appreciable uncertainty regarding the economic outlook. Nevertheless, the concern is that a number of companies who do want to borrow \u2013 whether it to be support their operations, lift investment, explore new markets - and are in decent shape are finding it hard to, so tight credit conditions are handicapping eurozone growth prospects. Bank lending to households and companies in the eurozone shrank again in December, suggesting appetite for credit remains low. ECB lending data show loans to the private sector fell 0.7% compared with the same month in 2011. The monthly flow of loans to non-financial companies fell \u20ac22bn in December, after falling by \u20ac7bn in November. The flow of loans to households dropped by \u20ac3bn, after a rise of \u20ac6bn in the previous month. That could put a more negative spin on news out on Friday that eurozone banks repaid more of their emergency ECB loans than expected. As Gary Jenkins noted this morning: The Spanish finance ministers said that Spanish banks repaying was a sign that the Spanish economy was on the rise. Maybe, but if that is the case there has not been a lot of data to support such an assertion recently. One could take the opposite view that early repayment is indicative of a lack of loan demand or confidence to lend, which would not be so good for the economy. The overall figure for eurozone M3 money supply \u2013 a general measure of cash in the economy \u2013 grew by 3.3% in the year to December, slowing down from 3.8% in November. Over in Greece, reports have emerged that workers at the country's main power company, the Public Power Corporation, will strike on Thursday in support of public transport employees who were forced back to work at the end of last week, ekathimerini reports: The main union representing Public Power Corporation workers, GENOP-DEI, said on Monday that its members will hold a 24-hour strike on Thursday, January 31. The union said it was taking the action in support of metro, tram and electric railway workers in Athens who were forced to return to work on Friday after a nine-day strike over wage cuts. The public transport workers were issued with civil mobilization orders by the government. GENOP-DEI said that the measure was \u201cillegal, undemocratic and unconstitutional\u201d. It is not clear if the strike threatens to cause any power outages. Meanwhile, the German finance ministry has apparently clashed with the European Central Bank (no change there then) over whether Cyprus could endanger the fragile progress made in the eurozone. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has repeatedly argued that it is not yet clear whether the problems in Cyprus could be a danger to the eurozone as a whole. This is crucial as the ECB will only rescue economies considered \"systemically relevant\". Der Spiegel reports \u2013 without citing any sources \u2013 that the ECB president, Mario Draghi, rebuffed Sch\u00e4uble's view last week. Draghi reportedly told Sch\u00e4uble during a gathering of eurozone finance ministers that Cyprus's two largest banks have an extensive network of branches in Greece and that customers' worries over the safety of their deposits could quickly wreck a fragile calm that has returned to Greece. A ECB board member, J\u00f6rg Asmussen, said he believed a bailout deal was possible at the end of March, after Cypriot elections on 17 February. The Monte dei Paschi scandal (see below) has turned the spotlight on the bank's close political ties with the centre-left and on possible failings by the Bank of Italy, which was at the time led by the current European Central Bank chief, Mario Draghi. It is thought the scandal could affect the outcome of upcoming elections in Italy. Reuters' Hugo Dixon writes: With a general election only weeks away, Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister, looks as if he will be the main winner from the political spat. Mr Berlusconi\u2019s camp has attacked Pier Luigi Bersani\u2019s Democratic party, which is leading in the opinion polls, for being close to Monte dei Paschi, or MPS. It has also criticised Mario Monti, the current prime minister, who agreed to increase the MPS\u2019s bailout to \u20ac3.9bn, or $5.25bn. The scandal won\u2019t be enough to get Mr Berlusconi back as prime minister. But it could prevent a Bersani-Monti coalition from running the country with a solid majority in both houses of parliament. If so, fears about Italian political risk could return to haunt the markets. Berlusconi has been grabbing headlines on a different front by praising the fascist dictator Mussolini on Holocaust Memorial Day. Our correspondent in Rome, John Hooper reports: Speaking to reporters at a commemoration event during which he appeared to fall asleep, Berlusconi said Mussolini's antisemitic race laws were the most blameworthy initiative of someone \"who, in many other ways, by contrast, did well\". He also said Italy \"did not have the same responsibilities as Germany\" and that Mussolini's co-operation with Hitler was \"not entirely conscious at the start\". His remarks, apparently intended to cut the ground from under the far right, prompted an outcry from other Italian politicians. But, as he has repeatedly done ahead of the election on 24 and 25 February, Berlusconi succeeded in grabbing the headlines. His tactics have helped reverse the decline of his Freedom People movement since he snatched back the helm in December. While over in Rome, the Bank of Italy approved \u20ac3.9bn of loans for a highly controversial state bailout of the world's oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena. But Italians have hit back at the planned rescue, as claims emerge that the bank may have hidden details of loss\u2013making derivatives deals from regulators. Founded in 1472, Monte dei Paschi faces losses of up to \u20ac720m from opaque derivatives trades, several of which are now under internal investigation. There were further developments in the saga over the weekend. Our correspondent in Rome, John Hooper writes: The left-leaning daily La Repubblica reported at the weekend that prosecutors were trying to find out what had happened to \u20ac2.6bn (\u00a32.2bn) paid into a London bank account during the 2007 sale of Banca Antonveneta to the world's oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which has traditionally had links the left. Of the total, \u20ac1bn appeared to be for a transaction with an international bank, but the other \u20ac1.6bn was apparently unaccounted for and prosecutors suspected the cash had been drip-fed back to Italy to form a slush fund, the paper said. Over the weekend, the Irish government confirmed that it would go ahead with a property tax, agreed by parliament as part of the IMFs bailout package in 2010. My colleague Phillip Inman reports: Plans by Ireland's government for a property tax have come under fire from the main opposition party amid concerns the move will land homeowners with a bumper bill as they struggle to pay a string of other new taxes. Protest meetings have heaped pressure on Ireland's finance minister, Michael Noonan, to drop the plan, which is expected to raise \u20ac500m (\u00a3425m) for the cash-strapped coalition government in its first full year. The finance ministry said at the weekend that the tax, agreed by parliament as part of the International Monetary Fund's bailout package in 2010, would go ahead alongside the first water rate bills, which are also expected to raise \u20ac500m. Taking a look at the day ahead, the global financial stability board holds its parliamentary meeting in Zurich, which presumably gave all the banking grandees a weekend on the slopes before heading over from Davos. And there's plenty of economic data and key speeches to keep us busy. Germany import price index (December): 7am ECB's Costa speaks in Lisbon: 8.45am Eurozone money supply (December): 9am Italy consumer confidence (January): 9am ECB's Asmussen gives press conference: 9.30am Italy wage inflation (December): 10am US durable goods orders (December): 1.30pm EU's Rehn speaks in Madrid: 1.30pm In the debt markets, Italy is selling zero coupon bonds and has a BTP auction, while the US is selling Treasury bills. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone debt crisis. Markets are expected to continue to rise this morning, as traders set aside concerns about growth and plough money into shares. But the crisis is not, by any means, over. Protests in Greece continued over the weekend as demonstrators came out in support of metro workers who were forced back to work at the end of last week, drawing a nine-day strike to a close. The IMF arrives in Spain today to start discussions with the government and investors as it prepares the second independent monitoring report on banking reform in the stricken country.",

Staff operating trollies, trains and trams decided to go back to work after a public prosecutor deemed their decision to walk off the job&#xa0;illegal. But bus drivers said they will hold out until Tuesday \u2013 a move that will exacerbate hardship for commuters ever more dependent on public transport as the cost of fuel rises. The move followed the country\u2019s highest legal body rejecting an appeal by striking metro employees against the government\u2019s controversial use of a civil mobilisation order forcing the sector back to work last week.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, protesting farmers (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/28/eurozone-crisis-live-markets-rally-further?commentpage=2#block-51065be295cb80127a45243b\">see report earlier</a>) may still blockade the country if prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 fragile coalition did meet their demands. These include inter alia, cutting the price of fuel \u2013 which they say has sent production costs soaring. Helena adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After holding talks with the farmers earlier today, Fotis Kouvellis who heads the ruling coalition's small Democratic Left party, gave a verbal \u201ccommitment not promise\u201d that the government would do its best to reach a solution. In Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s northern capital, worried officials announced that they would also hold emergency talks within the week to try and reach common ground. Farmers have vowed to block highways with their tractors in the event of impasse.</p> <p>\u201cRight now the country can\u2019t tolerate things developing in such a way,\u201d said Apostolos Tsitsikostas, the region\u2019s prefect. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow the country\u2019s economy to freeze at a time of great export activity,\u201d he added referring to the jump in exports from northern Macedonia in recent years.</p> <p>Northern Greece, and especially Thessaloniki, have the highest unemployment rates in the land.

The company was helping the mining ministry with its investigations, and has applied for the return of the laptops. Operations were said to be unaffected. Firestone said: The company confirms that on Wednesday 23 January 2013 a local police department removed computer equipment from the mine site in Liqhobong. There has been no disruption or impact to operations and the company is currently applying for a court order to repossess the computer equipment. The company has briefed the Minister of Mines for Lesotho and it is assisting with the investigation.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Premier Foods, the company behind Hovis bread, Mr Kipling cakes and Bisto gravy, has quit the company after less than 18 months in the job, during which he collected more than \u00a32.7m. Michael Clarke stunned investors on Monday by announcing he was standing down from the board with \"immediate effect\". The news sent the company's shares tumbling 12%. Clarke, who joined the company in August 2011, said he was leaving because he is \"looking to be CEO of a large corporation\". \"I've managed much bigger businesses in the past. I've got this business back on its feet \u2013 now it's the time to hand over,\" he said. Clarke said headhunters had approached him with a \"number of other opportunities\" but he felt it would be inappropriate to discuss other top jobs while he was leading Premier, which is struggling with debts of more than \u00a31bn. \"Now people are aware I'm open to a large opportunity,\" he said. \"I believe I have the capacity for a large CEO role in the UK or USA.\" He said he had been offered top jobs in different industries and would not restrict himself to jobs in fast-moving consumer goods \u2013 having spent most of his career at Coca-Cola and Kraft. Clarke said he would like a new job \"focusing on growth\" rather than implementing a turnaround with savage cost-cutting such as he has overseen at Premier. The company has cut more than 1,500 jobs over the past year, and sold many of its best-known brands, including Branston pickle and Sarson's vinegar. He refused to comment on rumours that he wanted to leave Premier because he felt his \u00a3750,000 salary wasn't enough. Premier paid him \u00a31.9m on joining the company. A further \u00a31.49m of shares was dependent on him staying until at least 2013. He will still be able to collect about \u00a3525,000 worth. Asked if he regretted joining Premier from Kraft, he said: \"It's been an interesting challenge, and I've definitely learnt a lot in the past 18 months. I don't necessarily want to do a repeat of the last 18 months. Restructuring is not something I want to be a specialist in.\" Clarke said he would start speaking to headhunters about a new job after he returns from holidays snowboarding with his son next week and at a beach with his wife. He will be replaced by Gavin Darby, until recently the boss of Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide, who starts in the job on Monday. David Beever, Premier's chairman, who was forced to cancel a holiday to Jamaica after speculation over Clarke's departure leaked on Friday night, said Darby was the \"standout candidate\" to replace Clarke. He later conceded Darby was the only person he interviewed for the job. \"I might have said 'hello' to someone else, but that was about it because we didn't get on,\" Beever said of the selection process. Beever said it was \"nonsense\" to suggest that Clarke had left because of a dispute over pay. He said Clarke's pay was \"perfectly normal for this kind of job, in this kind of environment\" and said Darby would not be paid more than Clarke. Darby promised to \"invest a significant personal sum\" in Premier's shares \u2013 which fell nearly 12% to 105p \u2013 with the company matching the size of his investment. Darby, who said his favourite Premier brand was Sharwood's Indian and Chinese sauces, has been ousted from two previous jobs, both times by Vodafone. He left the mobile phone giant in 2010 after a bust-up with chief executive Vittorio Colao. After he went on to become chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide, he was then not kept on by Vodafone when it took over CWW last summer. Martin Deboo, an analyst at Investec, said: \"We see the surprise change of leadership as unhelpful to Premier's stability and organic growth prospects. With its financial restructuring complete, we think that consistency and longevity of leadership was going to be critical to its prosperity.\"",

    "webTitle": "Controversial Chelsea Barracks scheme on hold as UK economy stalls", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Qatar has put its biggest single investment in London on hold, citing concerns about the British economy. The gas and oil-rich state has placed the \u00a33bn Chelsea Barracks housing development under review and a source close to the project said that while it could still go ahead, one option was to sell the site without building what has been dubbed a \"Gucci ghetto\" of 450 luxurious residences and 123 affordable homes. Qatari Diar, the emirate's property arm, has planning permission for the scheme, which includes seven-bedroom mansions as well as one-bedroom flats. But today the \u00a31bn site stands empty with weeds growing through the concrete. \"It now seems a huge gamble to deliver all of this,\" a Qatari source told the Guardian. \"[The developers] will take their time and see how the numbers stack up in due course.\" He added that while the scheme could still be built, \"they could sell [the site] any time\". The rethink of the Qataris' flagship project comes as the latest UK economic data show Britain heading for a triple-dip recession. Qatar is now the richest country in the world per capita and already owns 80% of the Shard, the tallest building in western Europe, all of Harrods and the US embassy in Mayfair and is joint owner of the Olympic village and the Shell Centre on the South Bank. But no office lettings have yet been announced in the Shard, and concerns about the future appetite for luxury homes in London mean the risk of pouring a further \u00a32bn into construction in a stagnant economy has caused concern in Doha. Britain's economic data has also compounded fears that the emirate overpaid when it gave the Ministry of Defence (MoD) \u00a3959m for the site in 2007. \"The strategy is under review,\" confirmed a Qatari Diar spokeswoman. \"[The developer] is taking advantage of the opportunity to review and respond to the context of the prevailing economic environment in preparing for the next stage of the development.\" Qatar's wariness also stems from its reluctance to cause further controversy in the UK, the Guardian understands. Qatar's purchase of the site in the oligarchs' playgrounds of Belgravia and Chelsea was made for geopolitical gain as well diversifying its wealth \u2013 Qatar has said it is part of a strategy of using property investments to \"redefine Qatar\" and \"create a sphere of influence in London\". But when Qatar published its original designs by the modernist architect Richard Rogers in 2009, Prince Charles personally wrote to the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, complaining the scheme was a \"gigantic experiment with the very soul of this city\" carried out by \"brutalists\". He urged Qatar instead to \"bequeath a unique and enduring legacy to London\" and the letter was published as part of a bruising high court battle that was uncomfortably high profile for the secretive emirate. Rogers was fired and the prince's architectural advisers were appointed to help draw up a brief to select a more traditional design, which royal aides have endorsed. With the replacement designs remaining controversial and Qatar counting Britain as an important ally in the politically and militarily volatile Gulf, Doha does not want to cause further problems with powerful neighbours, the Qatari source said. The decision to put the scheme on hold is seen as so sensitive that it has not been communicated to key consultants on the project. Architects commissioned to draw up the masterplan, including the designers of the Royal Opera House, Dixon Jones, have not received instructions for over a year and Westminster city council, which granted planning consent in the summer of 2011, has been kept in the dark. Local and national politicians had hoped the development would help alleviate London's acute shortage of affordable housing. When the site was being sold by the MoD, the then communities minister, Lady Andrews, said affordable housing units would contribute to solving \"the enormous housing stresses in London\". If the scheme were to be built, the Qataris would also be due to contribute \u00a378m to Westminster city council's housing fund. This week the site was desolate. Instead of bustling construction, buddleia sprouted from concrete and guard dogs prowled behind barbed wire-topped hoardings. \"I'm not sure anyone outside the Gulf knows [what's going on],\" said a consultant working on the scheme. \"When I ask the guys from Qatari Diar [in London], they just shrug their shoulders. It received outline consent in late 2011 and some work was done moving things forward with detailed designs. Those designs were sent to Doha and that was it. \"They paid about \u00a31bn for the site and maybe that was just pin money to them. It doesn't make sense to me. I look at what is on offer at Chelsea and I think people would snap it up.\" A source who was until recently working on the project said: \"It's odd they're not doing anything because the residential markets are really rolling right now.\" Located in what estate agents call the \"super-prime\" SW1 postcode area of west London, many of the flats would sell for more than \u00a310m, a price bracket that has seen a 40% rise in prices from the market upturn in March 2009 to June 2012, according to data from the estate agents Knight Frank. The number of sales in SW1 rose by 29% between 2011 and 2012. The Chelsea Barracks site is in a very wealthy area that has been largely insulated from economic decline. Luxury cars such as Ferraris with Swiss number plates cruise past exclusive furniture boutiques such as Linley, which is owned by the Queen's nephew, and Michelin-starred restaurants. In the last two years a third of properties sold in the SW1 area were purchased by British citizens, while 34% were bought by people from Russia, former Soviet republics and the Middle East. The lack of activity has been a mixed blessing for local opponents of the project, with some delighted that there is no building happening and others concerned at the uncertainty. \"We're selling London out to the Qataris and they're not coming up with the goods,\" said Georgina Thorburn, chairwoman of the Chelsea Barracks Action Group, a local group opposed to the development. \"A lot of local people have been very stressed out by this project, particularly the older residents, who worry about the impact on their lives. \"I'm not talking about the rich, but people who have been in the area a long time. They're the ones who want news.\"",

He said the market may well be underestimating the costs of superstorm Sandy on the company's US business, while UK price controls could leave it needing to either cut its dividend or seek a fundraising.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair lifted its full-year profit forecast on Monday as strong demand in northern Europe lifted average fares dramatically in the last three months of 2012. Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's top low-cost airline, which has used its size and low costs to undercut struggling flag carriers, raised its profit forecast to \u20ac540m (\u00a3460m) for the year to March, up from an earlier \u20ac490-520m range. \"We saw strong demand out of the UK, out of Germany and out of Scandinavia and that has gone straight to our bottom line,\" the chief operating officer, Michael Cawley, told Reuters. Strong demand in the runup to Christmas and a high uptake of reserved seating options helped to lift ticket prices in northern Europe well above the company's forecasts, he said. Sales were not as buoyant in southern Europe, with Spain in particular \"very weak\", and fare growth in Italy flat, he said. An 8% rise in average fares lifted the airline to a profit of \u20ac18m in the traditionally weak three months to December, compared with an average forecast by five analysts polled by Reuters of a \u20ac5m loss. Fare growth compared with 5% in the six months to September and was way ahead of the 3% average forecast by three analysts polled by Reuters. Average fares will grow at a slower pace in the three months to March, however, Cawley said. Ryanair has been able to sweep up customers as traditional rivals cut back capacity in the face of slow economic growth in Europe and high fuel costs. Revenues climbed 15% to \u20ac969m in the quarter, better than the 9.2% revenue growth its chief low cost rival, easyJet, reported last week. \"Demand is exceeding supply in the short-haul market and Ryanair is capitalising on it,\" said Davy stockbrokers analyst Stephen Furlong. \"The market will be very happy with these numbers.\" Higher fares helped Ryanair absorb a 24% rise in fuel costs compared with the same quarter last year. Fuel cost inflation is expected to ease to 5% in the year to March 2014 from 14% in the current financial year. Ryanair also said it remained confident European Union antitrust regulators would approve its bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus by March.",

      "body": "<p>Ryanair lifted its full-year profit forecast on Monday as strong demand in northern Europe lifted average fares dramatically in the last three months of 2012.</p> <p>Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's top low-cost airline, which has used its size and low costs to undercut struggling flag carriers, raised its profit forecast to \u20ac540m (\u00a3460m) for the year to March, up from an earlier \u20ac490-520m range.</p> <p>\"We saw strong demand out of the UK, out of Germany and out of Scandinavia and that has gone straight to our bottom line,\" the chief operating officer, Michael Cawley, told Reuters.</p> <p>Strong demand in the runup to Christmas and a high uptake of reserved seating options helped to lift ticket prices in northern Europe well above the company's forecasts, he said.</p> <p>Sales were not as buoyant in southern Europe, with Spain in particular \"very weak\", and fare growth in Italy flat, he said.</p> <p>An 8% rise in average fares lifted the airline to a profit of \u20ac18m in the traditionally weak three months to December, compared with an average forecast by five analysts polled by Reuters of a \u20ac5m loss.</p> <p>Fare growth compared with 5% in the six months to September and was way ahead of the 3% average forecast by three analysts polled by Reuters.</p> <p>Average fares will grow at a slower pace in the three months to March, however, Cawley said.</p> <p>Ryanair has been able to sweep up customers as traditional rivals cut back capacity in the face of slow economic growth in Europe and high fuel costs.</p> <p>Revenues climbed 15% to \u20ac969m in the quarter, better than the 9.2% revenue growth its chief low cost rival, easyJet, reported last week.</p> <p>\"Demand is exceeding supply in the short-haul market and Ryanair is capitalising on it,\" said Davy stockbrokers analyst Stephen Furlong. \"The market will be very happy with these numbers.\"</p> <p>Higher fares helped Ryanair absorb a 24% rise in fuel costs compared with the same quarter last year. Fuel cost inflation is expected to ease to 5% in the year to March 2014 from 14% in the current financial year.</p> <p>Ryanair also said it remained confident European Union antitrust regulators would approve its bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus by March.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The housing market has kicked off the year in better shape than it did in either of the previous two years, despite more sellers being forced to drop their asking prices in January, according to a new survey. A large majority of estate agents are optimistic that 2013 will see a steady rise in the number of home sales and the improving situation will put a floor under prices, which have fallen on average for the last two years. The survey, by online property agent Hometrack, found that 79% of estate agents are more upbeat about the market this spring than they were a year ago. The return of the feelgood factor to the property industry will cheer the Treasury, which is keen for consumers to regain their confidence and start spending. A bigger turnover in home sales could also spur the sale of furniture and housewares, which have suffered in the downturn. The housing market has been a key driver of activity in the wider economy and boosts taxes for the government through stamp duty and capital gains tax. While many economists have urged ministers to shift the economy away from property and finance to manufacturing, any signs of growth are likely to be welcomed, at least in the short term. Some analysts have argued that prices are likely to strengthen over the coming year due to the continued shortage of new homes, the UK's rising population and easier borrowing following the Bank of England's funding-for-lending scheme. The scheme, which launched last summer, offers high street lenders \u00a380bn in cheap loans.

Its latest study found that house prices were flat month on month across England and Wales in January following six months of falls. Around 16% of postcodes saw prices fall in January, representing a big slowdown in falls compared with the previous two months, when around 27% of districts recorded decreases. London, which has consistently outperformed other areas, was the only region to see an uplift in prices, with a 0.3% increase. They fell by 0.1% in Wales, Yorkshire and Humberside and the North East and by 0.2% in East Anglia. A growing divide has opened up between the property market inside the M25 and the rest of the country, causing concerns that Britain's economy is increasingly driven by the capital as it emerges from the financial crisis. Cranes are shooting up across London as plans mothballed after the banking crash, many of them for residential flats, get under way. Prices were unchanged over the month in the west Midlands, the east Midlands, the north-west, the south-east and the south-west. Of the estate agents who feel more optimistic about the housing market, most cited improvements to the mortgage situation and a \"growing realism\" among sellers about pricing as a factor. Across the country, the typical percentage of the asking price achieved in January was 93.1%. Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack, said: \"Despite the slow start, the housing market looks to be in slightly better shape than at the start of the previous two years. \"After the initial downturn in 2008 and the modest bounce-back in 2009/10, the housing market has been struggling to arrive at a point where pricing appears stable and there is broad alignment between what buyers are prepared to pay and sellers are prepared to accept for their home.\" The study regularly asks around 6,000 estate agents and surveyors about achievable selling prices in their area.
