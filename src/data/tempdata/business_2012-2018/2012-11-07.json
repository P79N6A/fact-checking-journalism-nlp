    "webTitle": "Boardroom gender quotas are dangerous, says Burberry boss", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry boss Angela Ahrendts has dismissed the idea of quotas to boost the number of women in the boardroom as \"dangerous\", despite growing evidence of discrimination in the business world and the prospect of just two female chief executives in the FTSE 100 next year. Asked if she was in favour of the imposition of quotas, Ahrendts said on Wednesday: \"I'm not. I think it's dangerous \u2026 Whether it's countries or companies, it's about putting the best person in the job who can unite people and create value. A man could do this job just as well as I can.\" The American, who took the helm at the British fashion brand six years ago, added that it was not an issue that she fretted about: \"I don't spend a lot of time thinking about this, what with three kids, running the company and being flat out busy.\" The recent resignations of Pearson boss Dame Marjorie Scardino and Cynthia Carroll, the chief executive of mining firm Anglo American, have reignited the debate about why there is a dearth of women at the top of Britain's biggest companies. Their departures will leave just Ahrendts and Imperial Tobacco's Alison Cooper fronting FTSE 100 companies in 2013. Pointing to the growing number of female university graduates, Ahrendts suggested it was just a matter of time before the gender balance improved. Announcing her decision to leave the media and publishing group Pearson after 15 years in charge, Scardino \u2013 who also rejected quotas \u2013 sounded a less optimistic note, saying: \"I thought, in 1997, that by the time I left Pearson, things would be different in terms of the number of chief executives and board members who are women. It's not really too different and, for that, I'm sorry.\" Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, has also waded into the debate and is one of the few top female bosses to support the introduction of quotas to boost the number of women ion the boardroom. She has described the current pace of change as \"glacial\". Despite a flurry of female appointments in the wake of last year's government inquiry led by Lord Davies of Abersoch, which set a target of 25% female representation on FTSE boards by 2015, women still occupy fewer than one-in-five FTSE 100 boardroom seats, with new hires strongly biased towards part-time, non-executive roles rather than promoting full-time employees into the most senior jobs. A report published earlier this week by the Chartered Management Institute also made grim reading. It found that female executives earn \u00a3400,000 less over the course of their working lives than male colleagues with identical careers \u2013 and are far more likely to be made redundant. Ahrendts' comments came as Burberry reported almost a 30% drop in first-half profits to \u00a3112m on sales of \u00a3883m. The decline reflected the company's decision to start producing its own perfume and makeup. In keeping with an industry-wide trend, the 156-year-old firm is buying back licences and has agreed to pay the French group Interparfums \u20ac181m (\u00a3145m) to sever its agreement, booking a \u00a374m accounting charge. The fashion firm said the decision would not have an impact on profits in the short term, but Investec analyst Bethany Hocking predicted it would create a \u00a371m boost by 2017. The firm, best known for its raincoats lined with a distinctive camel, red and black check design, spooked investors with a profit warning in September that whipped \u00a31bn off its stock market value. At that time it said growth had stalled in July and August, particularly in China, which has fuelled a near three-year boom in demand for luxury goods. Burberry also revealed that the spending power of its more \"aspirational\" consumers \u2013 a term used to describe middle-class consumers who spend a large proportion of their disposable income on designer labels but cannot stretch to the most expensive items \u2013 had been hit by the faltering global economy. It was able to make up some of the lost ground, with profit margins up in the six months to 30 September, as it sold a higher proportion of goods from its top-end lines to its wealthiest customers. The growing divide between Burberry's wealthy shoppers and its middle-class customers has been reflected in the fortunes of its various brands. Its most expensive ranges, such as Prorsum, which it shows on the catwalk, and London, are doing well, while sales of the cheaper casualwear line, Brit, which includes jeans and polo shirts, have slumped. Last month Burberry said sales had steadied in the final weeks of its second quarter and on Wednesday there was no change to its profit outlook for the second half. Shares closed down more than 4% at \u00a311.99.",

Accountants from Deloitte took charge of the loss-making retailer the end of last week after its US backers refused to provide additional funds to keep it going. The retailer, which has more than 6,600 staff and 236 stores, had also lost the support of its suppliers, since being cut adrift by its stock exchange listed owner Darty at the start of this year. With the prospect of huge job losses on the horizon, the collapse of Comet has sparked controversy. The retailer was bought by OpCapita for a token \u00a32 but it came with a \u00a350m dowry and industry insiders predict the turnaround firm, which is run by former investment banker Henry Jackson, will still make a multi-million pound profit from the deal. With no buyer expected to emerge for the whole chain there is a growing expectation that it will broken up with its best stores cherry-picked by rivals such as Dixons and Staples. Retail insiders have suggested that some stores could begin closing as early as next week. But with many suppliers asking for payment up front, Comet's stock reserves are already depleted. It held roughly \u00a3180m of stock when it was acquired by OpCapita, however, this was reduced to \u00a3120m as products sold were not replaced and it is not thought to have been able to source new stock in recent weeks. A Deloitte spokesman would only confirm that sale activity was getting under way on Thursday. The failure of Comet, the UK's second largest electricals specialist, is expected to result in a sales boost for market leader Dixons and on Wednesday its chief executive Sebastian James said it would offer a lifeline to thousands of Comet workers who are facing redundancy. The owner of PC World and Currys has delayed its normal Christmas recruitment drive, when it drafts in an additional 3,000 seasonal shop and warehouse staff, to give Comet staff the opportunity to apply for the temporary positions. Dixons said more than 500 Comet staff had already made enquiries with many walking into its stores still dressed in their Comet uniforms. \"For now the jobs are temporary, but we are hoping that a good number will become permanent,\" said a spokesman.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European commission on Wednesday forecast that George Osborne is likely to miss one of his key debt targets unless he takes action in next month's autumn statement \u2013 but also predicted that a struggling Britain would be the fastest growing of Europe's big five economies next year as it pencilled in a further year of stagnation for the austerity-hit nations of the single currency. With some in the City expecting the Bank of England to announce fresh stimulus measures to boost demand on Thursday, the European commission said a contraction of 0.3% in the UK economy this year would be followed by 0.9% expansion in 2013. The commission said, however, that it expected Germany, France, Italy and Spain to perform even less well than the UK next year, with the 17-nation eurozone eking out expansion of just 0.1% in 2013. In its regular economic healthcheck on the UK, officials in Brussels said: \"The outlook for growth remains very weak in the short term with the main risks to the macroeconomic forecast stemming from weaker-than-expected consumption and investment, and increased turmoil in the euro area.\" The EC added that George Osborne would have to announce new austerity measures in his autumn statement next month to avoid missing one of his two key budgetary targets - to reduce the national debt as a share of the economy by the end of the current parliament in 2015. \"Recent public finance data has been poorer than the Office for Budget Responsibility's projections, mainly due to lower corporation tax receipts rather than large increases in expenditure, and may overshoot the borrowing target for this financial year if it continues on its current trajectory.\" Despite the 1% increase in GDP recorded in the third quarter of 2012, the City believes the MPC's decision on Thursday will be tight. Recent business surveys for manufacturing, construction and services have been weak, while data for industrial production and retail sales showed that the strong performance at the time of the Olympics in August has not been sustained. Howard Archer, chief UK economist with IHS Global Insight, said he expected the Bank eventually to announce a new \u00a350bn round of quantitative easing but would probably hold off until the new year. \"It looks to be an ever closer call and there could very well be a tightly split vote within the monetary policy committee, but the odds look tilted marginally towards the Bank of England holding off from more quantitative easing.\" The commission said the eurozone as a whole would contract by 0.4% this year, markedly worse than the 1.4% growth in 2011. It cut its forecasts for 2013 growth in Germany, France, Italy and Spain as it predicted that unemployment would rise to a fresh peak of 11.8% next year. \"Europe is going through a difficult process of macroeconomic rebalancing, which will still last for some time,\" said the economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn. \"Europe must continue to combine sound fiscal policies with structural reforms to create the conditions for sustainable growth to bring unemployment down from the current unacceptably high levels.\" Brussels blamed the deepening sovereign debt crisis and financial market concerns about a possible breakup of the eurozone for the \"disappointing\" growth performance in 2012. It said domestic demand would make no contribution to eurozone GDP in 2013 as the lack of jobs and tax increases hit consumer spending. The commission expressed confidence that by 2014 the benefits of the austerity programmes would bear fruit, leading to expansion of 1.4%. Although the UK is expected to grow by just 0.9% next year, Brussels believes it will expand more quickly than any of the major economies of the eurozone. The commission has pencilled in growth of 0.8% for Germany, 0.4% for France, a contraction of 0.5% for Italy and a retrenchment of 1.4% for Spain. In all cases the predictions are for output to be weaker than expected by national governments, leading to budget deficit reduction targets being missed. Greece is one eurozone economy where the commission's forecasts are less pessimistic than those of the government. The EU executive believes the Greek economy will shrink by 6% this year and 4.2% in 2013 before finally emerging from a six-year slump with growth of 0.6% in 2014. The government is assuming contraction of 6.5% in 2012, 4.5% in 2013 and growth of 0.2% growth in 2014. Spain is expected to remain the eurozone's unemployment blackspot, with 26.6% of the workforce jobless in 2013. Greece's unemployment is forecast to peak at 24%, with another six countries \u2013 Ireland, France, Italy, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovakia \u2013 having double-digit jobless rates.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Politics in the US is about to go from knife-edge to cliff-edge. The closely fought battle for the White House is over but the battle to prevent the US economy nosediving back into recession is about to begin. Barack Obama has less than two months to broker a deal with the Republicans on Capitol Hill to prevent budget cuts worth $607bn (\u00a3380bn) of national output kicking in on 1 January. The fiscal cliff was barely mentioned during the presidential race, but the world is now going to hear about little else. Why? Because jumping off the fiscal cliff is seen by Wall Street, the City and the International Monetary Fund as the biggest threat to the global economy over the next year, dwarfing even the risk that a Greek exit from the eurozone would start the unravelling of monetary union. America, despite the rapid growth of China in the past two decades, remains the world's biggest economy, accounting for just under 20% of global output. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in Washington has estimated that the planned tax increases and spending cuts would reduce US gross domestic product by 4% in 2013, dwarfing the scale of George Osborne's austerity programme, which has involved budget tightening of 0.5-1% of GDP per year. To emulate in Britain what could be in store for the US, the chancellor would have to halve the NHS budget or put 10 pence on the basic rate of income tax. Removing 4% of US gross domestic product would have profound implications when the wounds from the deep downturn of 2008-09 have yet to heal. The CBO believes it would wipe out forecast growth and result in the American economy contracting by 0.5% in 2013 \u2013 although many economists say it would be far worse than that. The fear is that demand in the US would collapse, unemployment would head back towards 10% and the tentative recovery in the housing market would be thrown into reverse. Global trade flows would dry up, already shaky banks would nurse bigger losses, there would be a more rapid cooling of the Chinese economy, and the chances of a fragmentation of the eurozone would massively increase. These threats are so obvious and so imminent that economists expect Obama and Republicans on Capitol Hill to come to a settlement between now and the end of December. Although the relationship between the White House and Congress has been at best tetchy and at worse poisonous in the past four years, the expectation is that minds will now be concentrated. Gerard Lyons, the chief economist at Standard Chartered bank, said: \"Although the economy is improving, it is too fragile to cope with such a shock. The likelihood is a compromise, extending some combination of the tax and spending programmes. \"Although that would still not be constructive for growth, at least it would not be as bad as the worst case. In addition, it would remove the uncertainty, although, as on previous occasions, we are likely to see some nervousness until the year-end about whether things will be agreed in time.\" Two thirds of the planned budgetary tightening come from tax increases, something the Republican majority in the House of Representatives will find hard to accept. The expiry of George Bush's tax cuts alone are expected to raise $221bn, with a further $95bn to come from the end of the payroll tax rebate. Tax rates will increase for those earning more than $70,000 a year, with the top rate of income tax rising to 39.6%. The rest of the plan involves spending cuts totalling more than $1tn over the next nine years. Each government department will have its discretionary spending trimmed by 10%, although mandatory entitlements such as social security and Medicare would not be touched. Democrats argue that it would be foolish to cut spending when the economy remains weak, particularly given the poor state of America's public infrastructure. Paul Ashworth and Paul Dales, US analysts at Capital Economics, said: \"The basis for a deal to avert the fiscal cliff remains clear. Democrats are likely to agree to extend the tax cuts for high-income earners in exchange for Republicans agreeing to delay the spending cuts.\" They added, however, that this would amount to postponing the fiscal cliff without tackling the underlying problems and thus lead to further credit downgrades from the ratings agencies \u2013 Moody's, Standard and Poor, and Fitch \u2013 early next year. The US shrugged off the loss of its prized AAA rating in 2011, but the impact of a second downgrade might be to increase the cost of government borrowing and to push down the value of the dollar. Some fiscal tightening of policy is inevitable. Neither Democrats nor Republicans have expressed a desire to extend the payroll tax rebate holiday, while the cost of Obama's healthcare plan will add $18bn to the nation's tax bill next year. Compared with the eurozone, where falling output in 2012 is expected to be followed by a year of stagnation in 2013, the US is in reasonable shape. The economy is growing and US competitiveness is being boosted by cheap energy from shale gas. Some manufacturing capacity is being brought back to the US and there is the prospect of energy self-sufficiency within a decade. In the short term, however, the chances are that growth will remain sluggish and unemployment slow to come down. Deficit reduction, even if modest, will result in the Federal Reserve keeping monetary policy ultra loose. Interest rates will remain at rock-bottom levels deep into Obama's second term and the US central bank will consider further doses of quantitative easing to boost the money supply. This, though, assumes the fiscal cliff can be avoided. Obama won his second term despite what had happened to growth, jobs and living standards in the past four years. A majority of Americans were unhappy about the state of the economy but still gave the president a second chance. In the end it wasn't the economy, stupid. But it's about to be.",

      "bodyText": "Leading European companies announced job losses totalling more than 10,000 on Wednesday, underlining the scale of problems facing the continent's manufacturers. Vestas, the world's largest wind turbine manufacturer, said 2,000 jobs would be cut after it posted an almost doubling of pre-tax losses in the face of falling prices and fierce competition from China. Some of those jobs could be in the UK, where 500 jobs are also likely to go at Maltby coalmine in south Yorkshire after its owner, Hargreaves Services, declared it unsafe. Mobile telecoms equipment maker Ericsson said it would cut 1,550 jobs \u2013 nearly 10% of its staff in Sweden \u2013 blaming weakness in global demand for falling exports. Elsewhere garden equipment maker Husqvarna cut 600 jobs and German steel company Kl\u00f6ckner axed 1,800. In finance, the Dutch bank ING said it was laying off 2,350 people and a German newspaper reported that Commerzbank, the country's second biggest lender, might cut between 5,000 and 6,000 jobs. Commerzbank declined to comment, ahead of its financial results on Thursday. The Vestas cuts underline the crisis in the renewable energy sector and will reduce its workforce to 16,000 by the end of 2013 from nearly 23,000 just a year ago. The green energy sector has been hit by increasing uncertainty over government subsidy levels globally while facing a drop in prices caused by new competition from low-cost countries such as China. Ditlev Engel, the Vestas chief executive, unveiled the latest cutbacks as he reported a pre-tax loss of \u20ac158m (\u00a3126m) for the third quarter compared with \u20ac83m for the same period of 2011. The cuts would be made through asset divestments and retrenchments in various markets. Asked whether they would include the Isle of Wight, where the Danish-headquartered company has a research and development arm, Engel said: \"I am not going to say that there are not going to be any.\" But he indicated they would be relatively small and achieved by natural wastage rather forced redundancies. Vestas said it had already faced serious challenges in 2012 and had to position itself for a \"tough\" 2013, with a previously-buoyant US market going into decline. The company, which closed a manufacturing plant on the Isle of Wight three years ago and this year abandoned plans to build a new turbine building plant at the port of Sheerness in Kent, said it still had hopes for the UK wind market despite negative comments about onshore wind from new energy minister John Hayes and uncertainty over coalition clean energy policies. \"The industry is concerned that there will be an investment gap as one [industry support] mechanism is phased out and another phased in \u2026 Our clients [windfarm developers] do need to be confident about [the] long term.\" Engel was careful not to criticise Hayes or vocal Tory backbench wind sceptics but emphasised that the UK had \"fantastic [wind] resources\" comparable to Denmark. \"I can only say when I look at wind opportunities in the UK and Denmark that we [Denmark] have 50% of electricity coming from wind by 2020,\" he added. Vestas is preparing itself for subsidies such as the US production tax credit for wind power being cut even though the subsidy worth $1bn a year has had the support of the newly-elected Barack Obama. The uncertainty surrounding the tax credit decreased General Electric's energy infrastructure revenues by 5% in the third quarter as wind turbine sales dropped in the third quarter. Earlier this week Keith MacLean of the SSE power company, which is developing UK offshore farms, told the FT the UK government had introduced an \"unnecessary investment freeze\" by trying to change the way it subsidised low-carbon energy. Siemens is one of the few turbine manufacturers to have taken an offshore order in Britain over the past year while solar companies are furious about coalition cutbacks in the feed-in tariff.",

      "bodyText": "Online gambling group Betfair has withdrawn its online sports betting exchange in Germany, blaming the country's gambling tax regime for making its main product unviable. The company has been arguing with German tax authorities that its main product should not attract the 5% tax on stakes, as it does not actually take bets but allows punters to bet with each other. Shares in the group initially slumped on the news - although they have recovered since and are trading slightly down on the day at around 750p. The company floated in 2010 at \u00a313 a share on the back of a growth strategy that included geographic expansion. The gambling group said: Betfair has been working with the relevant tax authorities to seek clarification on interpretation of the law and its applicability to exchanges. The company is disappointed, however, that to date the tax authorities have not been able to agree to an interpretation of the law that would allow Betfair to continue to offer the exchange product.

      "bodyText": "Demand for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) cars in China remains strong after the UK manufacturer posted a 58% increase in second-quarter sales in the world's largest car market. China's interest in luxury British brands has been the subject of investor disquiet in recent months, with shares in retailers Mulberry and Burberry bearing the brunt, but Asian appetite for JLR products \u2013 from the Range Rover Evoque to the Jaguar XJ \u2013 appears undimmed. The Indian-owned car maker, which employs 24,000 people in the UK, said it sold 17,152 vehicles in the three months to September. Across the group, JLR sold 84,749 cars, up 29% on the same period last year as pre-tax profits doubled to \u00a3431m. JLR's chief executive, Ralf Speth, said the company had seen \"strong sales across all our key markets.\" China is JLR's third largest market, behind the US and the UK, with the latter also posting a strong performance as sales climbed by more than a fifth. JLR's Chinese sales growth was slower than the previous quarter, however, when it posted an increase of 86% for the three months to the end of June \u2013 a sales spurt that JLR attributed in part to the launch of the Evoque in China. The performance of the likes of JLR and BMW, which saw the German car maker announce a 40% increase in quarterly Chinese sales this week, contrasts starkly with European mass-market producers. France's Peugeot Citro\u00ebn is being rescued by the French state, while Ford has announced plans to shut three European plants, including two in the UK, and General Motors is expected to shut its Bochum site in Germany. European factories used by Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, Ford and GM are focused on meeting demand from a continental market that is in a steep decline, having fallen for the 12th successive month in September. Premium carmakers, by contrast, make fewer vehicles and have the outlet of strong US and emerging market demand. JLR's Speth said: \"Jaguar Land Rover will continue to invest in its products, plants and will drive further growth by spending in the region of \u00a32bn this year.\" The latest UK investment has seen JLR hire 1,000 more workers to launch a three-shift, 24-hour operation at its Halewood plant on Merseyside. However, JLR's next major production move will be outside the UK. Speaking to the Guardian in September as JLR launched a new Range Rover built in Solihull, Speth admitted production facilities would have to \"go where the markets are\", with plans for a Chinese plant now well advanced.",

He also told Reuters: I think gold will be going back to $1,800 this year. We are going to see higher gold [prices] in the coming days, weeks and months.",

While the CMI research illustrates the unequal level of earnings between male and female managers, junior female executives do earn marginally more than males (\u00a321,491 compared with \u00a321,128). However, that early edge is soon eradicated and the gender pay gap increases the higher up an organisation an individual rises, with female directors earning an average basic salary of \u00a3127,257, which is \u00a314,689 less than the male director average. The CMI study also shows how much more likely women are to lose their jobs. The CMI's \"labour turnover data\" illustrates that 4.3% of female executives were made redundant between August 2011 and August 2012, compared with 3.2% of male executives, meaning the number of women losing their jobs has almost doubled since the last survey from 2.2% in 2011. This difference grows as women hold more senior roles: twice as many female directors as male directors were made redundant (7.4% compared with 3.1%).Labour equalities spokeswoman Kate Green said: \"It is both unfair and unjustified that women should be paid less than men for doing equivalent jobs. \"The gender-pay gap at the management level is still higher now than it was in 2010, and at this rate, 42 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed, it will take at least another 21 years for management-level pay amongst men and women to be equalised. This is simply not good enough. \"It will be a continuing disappointment to many that the Government is still refusing to consider the provisions, provided for by Labour, to introduce mandatory equal pay audits if sufficient voluntary progress isn't made. \"We also learn that, in the year female unemployment hit a 25-year national high, women executives have been hit disproportionately hard by job losses and female directors have been made redundant at twice the rate of men. It is increasingly clear that, on jobs, as well as pay, the clock on women's equality is being turned back.\"",
