      "bodyText": "A company chaired by the former leader of the Conservative party made payments to a Somali government adviser as they were agreeing a lucrative oil contract with the troubled east African country, the Guardian has learned. Soma Oil and Gas, which is chaired by Lord Howard, paid legal fees to the independent advisory group, Petroleum Regimes Advisory (PRA) as PRA was negotiating on behalf of the government of Somalia. A spokesman for the campaign group Global Witness said that payments to PRA would raise serious questions about conflicts of interest as PRA was meant to be negotiating solely on behalf of the Somali government. The Serious Fraud Office raided Soma\u2019s London office last week after receiving corruption allegations about Soma\u2019s activities. Documents have also emerged showing that Soma had promised to pay \u201cstaff, consultants and advisers\u201d connected to the government of Somalia up to $5,000 (\u00a33,200) a month each. A letter signed by Soma\u2019s chief executive, Robert Sheppard, notes that the Somali government \u201crequires additional financial support for its role in connection with the performance of its functions in relation to the exploration programme\u201d. Along with payments of up to $5,000 a month for six staff to be chosen by the government, Soma also agreed to pay up to $40,000 for \u201coffice equipment, transportation and other working tools\u201d. According to another document seen by the Guardian, the deal proposed between Somalia and Soma would have given the company up to 90% of prospective oil revenues. Lord Howard\u2019s name appears on this draft production-sharing agreement. Agreements with developing countries usually allow host nations to retain a higher percentage of revenue from natural resources. Last year, a UN monitoring group warned that the oil and gas deals signed by the Somali government were \u201clikely to exacerbate legal tensions and ownership disputes and stunt the transparent development of Somalia\u2019s oil and gas sectors\u201d. A spokesman for Global Witness said the group had raised concerns about the Soma deal, which covers seismic surveys in Somalia\u2019s territorial waters and potential rights to the most valuable offshore blocks. \u201cIt is important that deals for natural resources in Somalia are scrutinised and transparent systems put in place, otherwise these resources will fuel conflict and corruption,\u201d said Barnaby Pace, a campaigner for Global Witness. \u201cAny indication of paying advisers to the Somali government raises serious questions about conflicts of interest.\u201d Jay Park, the managing partner of PRA, said: \u201cPetroleum Regimes Advisory was counsel to the federal government of Somalia in connection with negotiation of the seismic option agreement with Soma Oil and Gas in 2013. The legal fees of PRA that were charged to the federal government of Somalia were paid to PRA by Soma at the direction of the federal government of Somalia.\u201d Park declined to say how much PRA was paid by Soma. A spokesman for Soma said it had been \u201cinformed by the Serious Fraud Office that it is investigating an allegation that has been made against the company. Soma Oil and Gas is confident that there is no basis to the allegation and it is cooperating fully with the SFO to answer its queries. Soma Oil and Gas has always conducted its activities in a completely lawful and ethical manner and expects this matter to be resolved in the near future.\u201d \u201cThe SFO has confirmed that no suspicion whatsoever attaches to Lord Howard arising from the business of Soma and his role as a non-executive director of the company and he has agreed to speak with the SFO to help resolve their inquiry as quickly as possible.\u201d In a statement the company said: \u201cSoma has never made payments to individual government officials.\u201d Soma Oil and Gas was set up by a group of businessmen with extensive links to the Conservative party. They include the Tory donor Basil Shiblaq and Lord Clanwilliam, who supported David Cameron\u2019s leadership bid in 2005. The company is backed by the Russian billionaire Alexander Djaparidze.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three German carmakers have put their rivalries aside by teaming up to acquire a \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32bn) mapping business from Nokia, as they attempt to avoid being outsmarted by technology groups in the race to cash in on the driverless car revolution. Amid speculation that the likes of Uber, Amazon and Apple were preparing bids, Nokia, the Finnish communications group, agreed a deal to sell its Here unit to the consortium of Audi, BMW and Daimler, the Mercedes owner. The business is said to be one of the biggest and most valuable mapping assets to come to market in recent years. Its significance to the German carmakers is all the greater because of the way the driving experience is being transformed to become, in some cases, fully automated. \u201cThe car companies have been a bit slow off the mark in this area but this is an attempt to keep the technology in-house rather than let the Googles and Apples make all the running,\u201d said David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston Business School in Birmingham. \u201cThere are more and more autonomous features being developed all the time and the technology is transforming the industry.\u201d Although some basic navigation systems such as satnav have been hit by the arrival of services such as Google Maps, which is free to use, the new generation of mapping tools are sophisticated enough to assist automated driving. Despite the rise of Google Maps, the number of cars fitted with navigation systems is growing fast. In 2014, nearly 17m vehicles worldwide were produced with navigation systems. By 2021, that number is expected to increase to more than 25m, according to IHS, an automotive industry consultancy. Bailey said a range of suppliers and software providers are lining up to offer driver assistance features, with some analysts suggesting the market will grow from about $6bn now to some $25bn by 2020, and more than $50bn by 2025. Kevin Hamlin, a senior analyst at IHS, said the three rival car manufacturers had joined forces in order to stay in the game: \u201cIt\u2019s all about the battle for data,. The car companies are being proactive so that when we get to autonomous vehicles they do not have to rely on Google or somebody else in Silicon Valley. They will already have their own service provider and will control the data.\u201d The three companies have said they will continue to license the mapping services and data to other car groups, as happens now. The US investment bank Morgan Stanley has suggested that driverless vehicles will go on sale by the end of the decade, at first costing about $10,000 more than conventional cars. Manufacturers, including the German trio leading the Here deal, will be hoping it is the car industry, rather than technology suppliers, that leads the motoring revolution. Supporters of driverless cars say they could make roads safer and less congested, but sceptics argue they could be less safe and vulnerable to hackers. The future of Here, which employs about 6,500 staff, had been up in the air since April, when Nokia said it was undergoing a strategic review of the business. The company is in the process of completing a $16.6bn deal to buy French telecommunications firm Alcatel-Lucent, which will see the group gradually shift away from consumer electronics to telecoms infrastructure. In 2014, Here generated \u20ac971m (\u00a3682m) in sales but made a \u20ac1.2bn operating loss due to a large goodwill impairment. Nokia chief executive, Rajeev Suri, said the deal represented the latest stage of the company\u2019s transformation. He said Here\u2019s focus would be on developing mapping as well as services that will enable new driver experiences, including highly automated driving. Here\u2019s president, Sean Fernback, said the new ownership structure will \u201callow us to accelerate our strategy, further scale our business and fulfil our intent to become the leading location cloud company across industries\u201d. The purchasing consortium will hope the deal puts these three carmakers, at least, back in the driving seat in the car industry revolution. Test drivers: racing to build the car of the future The Here deal represents Audi, BMW and Daimler\u2019s fightback against a tech sector that is encroaching on carmakers\u2019 territory. But the German trio are taking on businesses that have considerable cash resources and are not restricted by the need to develop conventional vehicles at the same time. Google Google has long been a pioneer in the race towards driverless motoring and recently set up its own car division, Google Auto LLC. It is headed by Chris Urmson, project lead for Google\u2019s self-driving cars. The company is registered with national and international organisations as a passenger vehicle manufacturer, and was licensed last year as a carmaker in California. Documents obtained by the Guardian under a Public Records Act request in California show that Google Auto was formed as a limited liability company in late 2011. Initially, Google used it to modify and test the fleet of driverless Lexus SUVs that succeeded Google\u2019s first self-driving Prius saloons. Google Auto is named as the manufacturer of all 23 autonomous Lexus cars registered with California\u2019s department of motor vehicles, including all those involved in a recent spate of minor accidents in and around Google\u2019s home town of Mountain View. Apple The consumer electronics giant is reported to be working on an electric car or vehicle-related project that could be released by 2020. The company was reported earlier this year to have been on a hiring spree, attracting key members of car manufacturers\u2019 electric and new vehicle system teams. There have also been reports of a visit by senior Apple executives to a BMW plant in Leipzig, fuelling rumours that the two groups may announce a formal collaboration linked to car development. A report from Bloomberg indicates that Apple is targeting an electric car for release as early as 2020. Vehicles typically take seven years to develop. Tesla Perhaps closest to being ready for going driverless is the electric car specialist Tesla Motors, whose chief executive, tech pioneer Elon Musk, unveiled a software update last week that would allow its cars to autosteer and park. Musk said, in a series of tweets, that his company was \u201calmost ready to release highway autosteer and parallel autopark software update\u201d. He conceded, however, that there was still work to do before the software could decipher road markings at dusk. Tesla has for months been testing its driverless software prototypes on highways north of San Francisco.",

    "webTitle": "Former City trader Tom Hayes given 14-year sentence for Libor rigging", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Former City trader Tom Hayes has been sentenced to 14 years in jail after becoming the first person to be convicted by a jury of rigging the Libor interest rate. Hayes, 35, a former UBS and Citigroup yen derivatives trader, was convicted of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. Sentencing him at London\u2019s Southwark crown court, Mr Justice Cooke said: \u201cThe conduct involved here is to be marked out as dishonest and wrong and a message sent to the world of banking accordingly. The reputation of Libor is important to the city as a financial sector and the banking institutions of the City. \u201cProbity and honesty is essential as is trust. The Libor activity of which you played a leading part put all that in jeopardy.\u201d When the judge announced his sentence, Hayes \u2013 dressed in a light blue shirt and dark blue jumper with black slacks \u2013 put his head in his hands and ran his hands through his hair. During the reading of the judgement he shook his head repeatedly. Hayes was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years for each of the first four offences to run concurrently and four-and-a-half years for each of the second four. These will run consecutively to total 14 years. Hayes, from Fleet, Hampshire, was accused of being the ringleader in a vast conspiracy to fix the London interbank offered rate (Libor) between 2006 and 2010. As well as being a vital measure for banks, Libor was used as a benchmark to price a wide range of financial products. An estimated $300tn (\u00a3192tn) of contracts are based on Libor, setting borrowing rates for businesses and consumers from Sydney to New York and London. Motivated by greed and a desire for higher pay, the court heard that Hayes set up a network of brokers and traders that spanned 10 of the world\u2019s most powerful financial institutions, cajoling and at times bribing them to help rig rates \u2013 designed to reflect the cost of interbank borrowing \u2013 for profit. Hayes would then place large bets on financial markets that were sensitive to Libor moves. The former trader, who was diagnosed with mild Asperger syndrome just before his trial began, said he was transparent about trying to influence rates and his managers were aware. But a jury of seven men and five women rejected his defence and found him guilty on all eight counts. The case was seen as a big test for the Serious Fraud Office and its effectiveness in policing banking fraud. In a statement after the trial, the SFO said: \u201cThe jury were sure that in his admitted manipulation of Libor, Hayes was indeed dishonest. The verdicts underline the point that bankers are subject to the same standards of honesty as the rest of us. This brings to an end one strand of the SFO\u2019s continuing Libor investigation. Another 12 individuals await their trial of which one has pleaded guilty.\u201d Hayes claimed he was taking part in an \u201cindustry-wide\u201d practice. He described the broking market he worked in as the wild west, a place with no rules and where relationships relied on lavish entertainment. He said it was this high-pressure environment which took its toll on him, prompting him to threaten brokers and pick fights with colleagues to move interest rates to aid his trading. However, Justice Cooke said the essence of Hayes\u2019s defence had been that the type of activity the accused had been involved in was commonplace. \u201cThe fact that others were doing the same as you is no excuse,\u201d the judge said. Defence counsel Neil Hawes QC had argued before the sentencing that there were people who were more senior to Hayes who had been aware of the activities. He said that Hayes had become the primary carer for his son and the information he provided to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) had \u201caccelerated\u201d their knowledge. However, the judge said there was little by way of mitigation and that Hayes would serve half of his sentence in custody before being released on licence. Hayes is the first person to stand trial for alleged manipulation of Libor. He was arrested in December 2012 and questioned by the Serious Fraud Office. He told SFO investigators that his trades had earned \u00a3150m for UBS in a three year period. He said he originally confessed to misconduct in 2013 after being \u201cfrozen with fear\u201d that he would be extradited to America. He said he did not believe he had acted dishonestly with regard to Libor and that he wanted to do his job \u201cas perfectly\u201d as he could. US prosecutors wanted to charge Hayes on three counts of conspiracy to fraud, with each one carrying a 20 to 30-year sentence. He subsequently withdrew from a co-operation agreement with the SFO and in December 2013 pleaded not guilty.",

      "bodyText": "As the chancellor prepared to press the button on his first sale of Royal Bank of Scotland stock, the share price fell to within pennies of its lowest level this year. Don\u2019t worry, advocates of an early sale will argue, the mere act of starting to dispose of the stake will lead to better prices in future. According to the official script, the government\u2019s steady shuffle towards the exit will awaken the interest of long-term investors. No longer will they shun a bank kept on a tight leash by the Treasury; instead, they will be attracted to a normal commercial institution where the biggest shareholder also seeks value for money. As the letter from Rothschild, George Osborne\u2019s investment banking advisers, put it in June: \u201cThe returns on the government\u2019s interventions in RBS will be determined by the success of the whole of the selling programme, rather than the terms achieved on the first few disposals.\u201d Fair enough. But, before Osborne is tempted to accelerate the disposal programme, let\u2019s see if the Rothschild vision of a slowly appreciating share price is realised. RBS\u2019s share price was 355p when the chancellor announced his plans to June. Now it is 337p and the first 5% tranche of stock was reported on Monday night to have departed at 330p. A little slippage is to be expected at the outset but this is not an encouraging start. Thus the Treasury needs to be strict about the prices at which the second and third slices depart. A loss on the disposal of RBS is inevitable since the privatisation price of 502p is miles away. But the size of the loss matters. It would scandalous if Osborne\u2019s desire to get shot of RBS trumps the pursuit of value of money for taxpayers. As a rough guide, by the time 20% of the state\u2019s stake has been sold, the rest of the shares should be fetching 400p-plus. If not, the Rothschild theory will need revision. Keep your options open, chancellor. Libor sentence is extraordinary The conviction of Tom Hayes will send shudders through dealing rooms across the City. The Serious Fraud Office has demonstrated that it can secure a conviction for market-rigging even in a case when the defendant argued that his bosses were aware of his activities. The deterrent effect will be powerful. \u201cWhat this case has shown is the absence of that integrity that ought to characterise banking,\u201d said the judge. Amen to that. But the length of the sentence \u2013 14 years \u2013 is extraordinary. This was a sophisticated act of rigging markets and the prosection characterised Hayes as a ringleader. But this was not armed robbery, a crime that might attract a similar punishment in the case of a first offender. The judge, by opting for sentence close to the maximum, is saying, in effect, that Hayes\u2019 acts were among the worst that could be imagined for this type of crime. That is an extremely strong position to adopt. What happens if a case turns up that is even more severe? That, surely, is not hard to imagine. Rolls-Royce needs a long-term plan Here\u2019s a piece of unnecessary advice for Warren East, the new chief executive of Rolls-Royce: don\u2019t get as excited as the rest of the world about the arrival of ValueAct, a US activist hedge fund, as a 5.4% shareholder. Rolls-Royce\u2019s share price has risen 10% since last Friday, when ValueAct\u2019s position became public, but it\u2019s not clear why. Maybe the idea is that management will receive a kick up the backside. Or maybe the thinking is that Rolls-Royce will be obliged to consider a sale of its underperforming marine division, which largely powers vessels for the offshore oil and gas industry. On both scores, East should be his own man. He is, presumably, fully aware of the company\u2019s tardiness under predecessor John Rishton in cutting costs in civil aerospace. But the skill lies in cutting sensibly and implementing a credible plan. Rolls-Royce, the ultimate long-term business, would be mad to risk losing its engineering excellence. Profit margins in five years\u2019 time, not next year, are the ones that matter. On the shape of the company, early indications suggest East agrees with Rishton: that Rolls-Royce\u2019s engineering skills can be transferred across divisions and that greater value can be secured that way. If that\u2019s his considered view once he has taken stock, he should be prepared to defend Rolls\u2019 current span of activities. On Monday the talks between Rolls-Royce and ValueAct were described as \u201cconstructive\u201d, which could mean anything or nothing. The US fund carries a reputation for being a long-termist. Let\u2019s hope so because the option of a quick fix for Rolls-Royce probably doesn\u2019t exist.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cSometimes,\u201d says a character in David Foster Wallace\u2019s novel The Pale King, \u201cwhat\u2019s important is dull. Sometimes it\u2019s work. Sometimes the important things aren\u2019t works of art for your entertainment.\u201d It is worth bearing that in mind as we consider TTIP, the most boring thing we\u2019re supposed to get angry about since \u2013 ooh \u2026 was it PFI schemes that nobbled hospitals, eviscerated schools and left Britain \u00a3222bn in debt? Or was it the asymmetrical constitutional ramifications inherent in the West Lothian question? Or George Osborne\u2019s incomprehensible pension changes involving auto-enrolment annuities, tax wrappers, pots and draw-downs? Christine Lagarde\u2019s last press conference about the Greek debt crisis? Maybe it was your last mobile phone bill. Add up the boredom you experienced on each of those occasions, multiply the result by the international coefficient of tedium (which, as you know, is 27.5) and that\u2019s how bored the international trade deal known as TTIP will make you. The Guardian\u2019s expert on obfuscation by bureaucratese and acronym, Steven Poole, recently argued that TTIP could be a conspiracy to pull some very thick wool over our eyes. We live in an age when we\u2019re so accustomed to being entertained that we haven\u2019t the temperament to do the difficult work of penetrating the wool of boring. So we\u2019re going to take that wool, roll it into a ball and leave it for the cat to play with. No, don\u2019t look at the cat. Look at me. Focus. So, what is TTIP? Remember when acronyms starting with two TTs were lovely things such as TTFN (ta-ta for now)? TTIP isn\u2019t like that. It stands for Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Last month, the European parliament voted to allow the European commission to continue negotiations with the United States to create the world\u2019s largest free-trade zone, which is what TTIP is all about. Conservative trade spokesman Emma McClarkin said: \u201cI welcome the fact that, following weeks of parliamentary ping-pong and attempts by socialist and protectionist MEPs to derail the process, we finally have a clear backing for TTIP.\u201d Right, stop thinking how much fun parliamentary ping-pong sounds, particularly if a cat joins in. What McClarkin is looking forward to is greater regulatory harmonisation and a consequent boost for business, some of it, incredibly, British. Today, for instance, the US and EU have different regulations testing the safety of cars, drugs and soft furnishings. That imposes costs on transatlantic exporters of cars, drugs and soft furnishings \u2013 especially, you would think, on exporters of upholstery for drug dealers\u2019 cars. One possible consequence of harmonisation could be a boost for British car exports. Imagine: one day Americans will be driving trim little Nissans made in Sunderland rather than ludicrous Hummers concocted in the bowels of hell. There are other projected benefits. US ambassador to the EU Anthony L Gardner argues that TTIP is, if you\u2019ll pardon the expression, geopolitically pertinent, and that it would \u201cprovide an economic equivalent to Nato\u201d that would settle \u201cthe rules of world trade before others do it for us\u201d. Think about it this way: right now, Vladimir Putin can, if he chooses, strip to the waist for a photo op in which he turns off the gas pipe from Russia to Europe. That\u2019s not good enough. Instead of being dependent on nasty Russian gas and oil, then, as a result of TTIP, the EU might become dependent on lovely American and Canadian gas and oil. That\u2019s one reason behind the EU\u2019s call for a dedicated chapter in TTIP on energy and raw materials. Instead of Russia isolating the EU, the EU could isolate Russia. Sweet. We have been invited to pronounce TTIP \u201ctea tip\u201d. Don\u2019t these knuckleheads have any sense of history? The world\u2019s most famous tea tip was in Boston in 1773, and that resulted in the marvellous era of transatlantic cooperation known as the American War of Independence. TTIP is not to be confused with TPP, which is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, involving 12 countries including the US, Australia and Brunei, and which, like TTIP, is still under negotiation. There is also, incidentally, something called Ceta, which stands for Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. It is like TTIP but for Canada and Europe and, so far as I understand it, means that Europeans will soon bathing in maple syrup while reading Margaret Atwood novels. Which is probably nicer than it sounds. Ceta is due to be ratified by the European parliament later this year but the document is currently undergoing a process of what is called \u201clegal scrubbing\u201d, which sounds like the sort of thing Americans do to their chickens, but in fact is another species of the kind of gobbledegook rampant in modern life and means minimising the document\u2019s exposure to legal action. But that\u2019s not all. There is also Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was established in 1994 and, proponents of TTIP think, demonstrates the kind of inspiring benefits and harmonisation of standards that might result if TTIP comes into force. Think of it this way. Just as, thanks to Nafta, for the past 21 years Americans have been saying \u201caboot\u201d and forming their own mariachi bands, Mounties have been wearing sombreros and Mexicans putting maple syrup on their quesadillas, so in the future, thanks to TTIP, Americans might drink coffee from cups the size of thimbles, while Europeans might wear 10-gallon hats even though, on average, we\u2019ve only got six-gallon-sized heads and so would look ridiculous. But seriously. How is TTIP going to affect me? TTIP will hit Europeans like you in the pocket, critics argue, so you need to pay attention. While the European commission estimates that, by 2027, TTIP could boost the size of the EU economy by \u00a394bn or 0.5% of GDP, an economic study by Jeronim Capaldo of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University argues that the commission\u2019s econometric modelling is jejune and that, in fact, TTIP will clobber Europeans. Capaldo predicts 600,000 European job losses as a result of TTIP, a net fall in EU exports, declining GDPs for EU member states and a fall in Europeans\u2019 personal income. Why people are so angry about TTIP? Because Americans are, with all due respect, disgusting slobs always chasing a fast buck and thus very different from us fragrant Europeans who are, like Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way. One worry is that the main goal of TTIP is to remove EU regulations that stop its citizens being poisoned, killed or subject to rampant pollution so that more profits can be made by corporations on both sides of the Atlantic. For instance, critics argue that if TTIP involves, as the EU hopes, a commitment that would guarantee automatic licences for all future US crude oil and gas exports to Europe, that would result in a boom in US fracking to keep Europeans powered with shale gas, not to mention greater exploitation of oil from Canadian tar sands. Such developments, argue critics, would undermine not just the EU\u2019s fuel quality directive but ruin what is left of the planet worth ruining. Consider one aspect of TTIP that is giving European critics the particular pip. It involves another acronym, so steel yourselves. That acronym is ISDS, which stands for \u201cinvestor-state dispute settlement\u201d. This procedure would allow companies to sue foreign governments over claims of unfair treatment and to be entitled to compensation. Similar provisions in other treaties have allowed, for example, tobacco conglomerate Philip Morris to sue Uruguay and Australia for enacting anti-smoking legislation, and a Swedish energy company to take legal action against Germany for phasing out nuclear power. Critics say ISDS provisions undermine the power of national governments to act in the interests of their citizens. According to John Hilary, the executive director of War on Want, leaked documents show that medical and health services, social services, education, post, finance, telecommunications, transport, energy, water, environmental and cultural services are all on the table in TTIP, meaning that American corporations may have full access to them. That is why there is a big banner outside the US embassy in Berlin that says (try saying this in the whiniest German voice you can muster): \u201cDemokratie ist keine Handelsware,\u201d which means democracy is not for trading.. Of course there is. It is also why there is some unacceptably unfunny graffiti in Malm\u00f6 that depicts Barack Obama grinning oleaginously as a wooden horse marked TTIP is dragged into Europe. In the UK, there are fears that ISDS could threaten the NHS because it might allow private firms running hospital services to sue the government if it chose to return the services to the public sector. The French government has already negotiated its film industry\u2019s exemption from these provisions, so why can\u2019t the NHS be, critics ask? But the idea that ISDS is subverting democracy in favour of wicked corporations is a conspiracy theory, argues the European Policy Information Center, which \u2013 unforgivably \u2013 is already spelling \u201ccentre\u201d the American way. Epicenter (as this group is acronymically known) is made up of groups, such as the UK\u2019s Institute of Economic Affairs, that are in favour of TTIP. It argues that we shouldn\u2019t worry about ISDS provisions. Why? Because the clause is a time-honoured means whereby corporations protect their investments, and does not undermine EU or member states\u2019 right to pursue legitimate public policy objectives. Or consider food regulations. While the EU has an impressively alliterative \u201cfarm to fork\u201d strategy, for instance, regulating each link in the food chain, Americans pump their cattle and pigs with growth-promoting hormones banned in the EU. As a result, most US beef can\u2019t be sold in the EU. Worse, Americans use 82 pesticides banned in the EU. They wash their chicken in chlorinated water to kill bacteria. Ninety per cent of their soya, cotton and corn is genetically modified, while the EU allows member states to ban GM production. France, for instance, has banned GM, and Gauloises-smoking, beret-wearing toughs now patrol French fields to ensure that the excrescence of GM never sullies la belle France again. So how could we possibly abandon these glorious European standards? The spectre of what lavishly moustachioed French farmer/anti-globalisation activist Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 calls la malbouffe Americaine (rubbish American food) lurks behind the fears of this trading alliance. \u201cYeah?\u201d retort Americans. \u201cSo how come you dumbass Europeans got mired in a horse-meat scandal in 2013 if your food regulations are so darn tootin\u2019?\u201d Which, you have to admit, is a good comeback. Or consider data privacy rights. Don\u2019t Americans realise that us Europeans don\u2019t care to be snooped on by the NSA or have Google peer 24/7 into our very souls? MEPs are worried that TTIP might undermine EU data protection laws, and that\u2019s why they have called for an \u201cunambiguous, horizontal, self-standing provision\u201d in it to guarantee citizens\u2019 right to privacy. Can something be horizontal and self-standing at the same time, you ask? It seems, I concede, unlikely. Who is angry about TTIP? Groups as disparate as War on Want and Ukip are united in anger about TTIP, though for different reasons. The Institute of Economic Affairs and the Conservative party are united in not being angry. The Labour party is \u2013 surprise! \u2013 conflicted. Let\u2019s consider Labour first. Labour MEP Jude Kirton-Darling, while arguing that ISDS is a \u201cpara-judicial and opaque system of private arbitration [that] allows companies to sue governments at great cost to the taxpayer\u201d, also says that TTIP \u201ccould present us with a unique chance to regulate globalisation and to promote EU standards\u201d, as well as \u201cproviding a much-needed boost to local economies, support to SMEs and new and exciting jobs and training opportunities\u201d. As for Ukip, Farage and his chums oppose TTIP because they think it\u2019s a smokescreen. It\u2019s not about trade, stupid, it\u2019s about promoting \u201cthe political pretensions of a wannabe European superstate\u201d and \u201csetting up a parallel system that undermines national courts and national legal systems\u201d, as the party\u2019s international trade spokesman William Dartmouth MEP said in the European parliament last month. After the vote went against Ukip\u2019s stance last week, Dartmouth said that the only way citizens can defeat TTIP now is to vote to leave the European Union. But that\u2019s Ukip\u2019s answer to everything. As for War on Want, its views are more typical of the pressure groups, unions, charities, NGOs and environmentalists that oppose TTIP. There are, for example, 480 such groups affiliated to the Berlin-based Stop TTIP campaign, whose supporting organisations include trade unions like the NUT, NGOs such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace and, my personal favourite, the Pirate Parties of Greece, Germany, Slovenia and the Netherlands, which have no leaders but a splendid flag. The campaign has a 2.3 million-signature petition calling on the EU to \u201cstop these sinister trade deals\u201d, by which it means both TTIP and CETA. One of War On Want\u2019s major concerns is that TTIP is being negotiated in secret. And with good cause: what nobody seems to have pointed out yet is that if TTIP negotiations do continue, as expected, until next year at the earliest, often in secret with (I suspect) all sorts of complicated car switcheroos, dead letter drops and tooled-up security johnnies in shades talking furtively into their wrists, the costs of negotiations might outweigh any supposed benefits of what they\u2019re negotiating about. But are TTIP negotiations being conducted in secret? Giacomo Lev Mannheimer of Istituto Bruno Leoni argues that is another conspiracy theory. And, indeed, he points to the dismal truth that there are lots and lots and lots of TTIP-related documents about its benefits, impact on public services, food and agriculture rules. Mannheimer makes a good point, though critics argue that the real meat of negotiations takes place elsewhere and ordinary European citizens don\u2019t get a say in them. What Mannheimer doesn\u2019t consider is the more disturbing truth that there is an inverse relationship between the number of funny videos on YouTube and the user traffic on European commission websites relating to TTIP. Indeed, if TTIP is about liberalising the parameters of boring, there are some of us who are prepared to fight back. And when I say \u201cfight back\u201d, I mean kick back on a sofa watching kittens get tickled.",

Watch our short video explainer on the TTIP</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Conservative trade spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/ttip-eu-parliament-vote-paves-way-new-isds\">Emma McClarkin said</a>: \u201cI welcome the fact that, following weeks of parliamentary ping-pong and attempts by socialist and protectionist MEPs to derail the process, we finally have a clear backing for TTIP.\u201d Right, stop thinking how much fun parliamentary ping-pong sounds, particularly if a cat joins in.</p> <p>What McClarkin is looking forward to is greater regulatory harmonisation and a consequent boost for business, some of it, incredibly, British. Today, for instance, the US and EU have different regulations testing the safety of cars, drugs and soft furnishings. That imposes costs on transatlantic exporters of cars, drugs and soft furnishings \u2013 especially, you would think, on exporters of upholstery for drug dealers\u2019 cars. One possible consequence of harmonisation could be a boost for British car exports. Imagine: one day Americans will be driving trim little Nissans made in Sunderland rather than ludicrous Hummers concocted in the bowels of hell.</p> <p>There are other projected benefits. US ambassador to the EU Anthony L Gardner argues that TTIP is, if you\u2019ll pardon the expression, geopolitically pertinent, and that it would \u201cprovide an economic equivalent to Nato\u201d that would settle <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-industry/us-ambassador-eu-anthony-l-gardner-beyond-growth-ttip-must-happen\">\u201cthe rules of world trade before others do it for us\u201d</a>. Think about it this way: right now, Vladimir Putin can, if he chooses, strip to the waist for a photo op in which he turns off the gas pipe from Russia to Europe. That\u2019s not good enough. Instead of being dependent on nasty Russian gas and oil, then, as a result of TTIP, the EU might become dependent on lovely American and Canadian gas and oil. That\u2019s one reason behind the EU\u2019s call for a dedicated chapter in TTIP on energy and raw materials. Instead of Russia isolating the EU, the EU could isolate Russia. Sweet.</p> <p>We have been invited to pronounce TTIP \u201ctea tip\u201d. Don\u2019t these knuckleheads have any sense of history? The world\u2019s most famous tea tip was in Boston in 1773, and that resulted in the marvellous era of transatlantic cooperation known as the American War of Independence.</p> <p>TTIP is not to be confused with TPP, which is the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/p/eap/rls/rm/2014/01/219881.htm\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a>, involving 12 countries including the US, Australia and Brunei, and which, like TTIP, is still under negotiation.</p> <p>There is also, incidentally, something called Ceta, which stands for Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. It is like TTIP but for Canada and Europe and, so far as I understand it, means that Europeans will soon bathing in maple syrup while reading Margaret Atwood novels. Which is probably nicer than it sounds. Ceta is due to be ratified by the European parliament later this year but the document is currently undergoing a process of what is called \u201clegal scrubbing\u201d, which sounds like the sort of thing Americans do to their chickens, but in fact is another species of the kind of gobbledegook rampant in modern life and means minimising the document\u2019s exposure to legal action.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not all. There is also Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was established in 1994 and, proponents of TTIP think, demonstrates the kind of inspiring benefits and harmonisation of standards that might result if TTIP comes into force. Think of it this way. Just as, thanks to Nafta, for the past 21 years Americans have been saying \u201caboot\u201d and forming their own mariachi bands, Mounties have been wearing sombreros and Mexicans putting maple syrup on their quesadillas, so in the future, thanks to TTIP, Americans might drink coffee from cups the size of thimbles, while Europeans might wear 10-gallon hats even though, on average, we\u2019ve only got six-gallon-sized heads and so would look ridiculous.</p> <h2><strong>But seriously. How is TTIP going to affect me?</strong></h2> <p>TTIP will hit Europeans like you in the pocket, critics argue, so you need to pay attention. While the European commission <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33055665\">estimates</a> that, by 2027, TTIP could boost the size of the EU economy by \u00a394bn or 0.5% of GDP, an economic study by Jeronim Capaldo of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University <a href=\"http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/14-03CapaldoTTIP.pdf\">argues</a> that the commission\u2019s econometric modelling is jejune and that, in fact, TTIP will clobber Europeans. Capaldo predicts 600,000 European job losses as a result of TTIP, a net fall in EU exports, declining GDPs for EU member states and a fall in Europeans\u2019 personal income.</p> <h2><strong>Why people are so angry about TTIP? </strong></h2> <p>Because Americans are, with all due respect, disgusting slobs always chasing a fast buck and thus very different from us fragrant Europeans who are, like Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way. One worry is that the main goal of TTIP is to remove EU regulations that stop its citizens being poisoned, killed or subject to rampant pollution so that more profits can be made by corporations on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/ttip-do-you-have-concerns\">Do you have concerns about TTIP?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For instance, critics argue that if TTIP involves, as the EU hopes, a commitment that would guarantee automatic licences for all future US crude oil and gas exports to Europe, that would result in a boom in US fracking to keep Europeans powered with shale gas, not to mention greater exploitation of oil from Canadian tar sands. Such developments, argue critics, would undermine not just the EU\u2019s fuel quality directive but ruin what is left of the planet worth ruining.</p> <p>Consider one aspect of TTIP that is giving European critics the particular pip. It involves another acronym, so steel yourselves. That acronym is ISDS, which stands for \u201cinvestor-state dispute settlement\u201d. This procedure would allow companies to sue foreign governments over claims of unfair treatment and to be entitled to compensation. Similar provisions in other treaties have allowed, for example, tobacco conglomerate Philip Morris to sue Uruguay and Australia for enacting anti-smoking legislation, and a Swedish energy company to take legal action against Germany for phasing out nuclear power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b19d04971876b0e0e63fc6dda44f49d77747ce8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/3/1438619807739/5925fbec-5a3a-49f0-b58f-a6759be4c08e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A US chicken farm\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An American chicken farm \u2026 US food is subject to different regulations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics say ISDS provisions undermine the power of national governments to act in the interests of their citizens. <a href=\"http://media.waronwant.org/sites/default/files/TTIP%20booklet%20for%20RLS%2C%202015%20update.pdf?_ga=1.21501627.1096893980.1436439877\">According to John Hilary, the executive director of War on Want</a>, leaked documents show that medical and health services, social services, education, post, finance, telecommunications, transport, energy, water, environmental and cultural services are all on the table in TTIP, meaning that American corporations may have full access to them.</p> <p>That is why there is a big banner outside the US embassy in Berlin that says (try saying this in the whiniest German voice you can muster): \u201cDemokratie ist keine Handelsware,\u201d which means democracy is not for trading.. Of course there is. It is also why there is some <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/TTIP_graffiti_in_Malm%C3%B6.JPG\">unacceptably unfunny graffiti in Malm\u00f6</a> that depicts Barack Obama grinning oleaginously as a wooden horse marked TTIP is dragged into Europe.</p> <p>In the UK, there are fears that ISDS could threaten the NHS because it might allow private firms running hospital services to sue the government if it chose to return the services to the public sector. The French government has already negotiated its film industry\u2019s exemption from these provisions, so why can\u2019t the NHS be, critics ask?</p> <p>But the idea that ISDS is subverting democracy in favour of wicked corporations is a conspiracy theory, argues the <a href=\"http://www.epicenternetwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IBL_Focus_250-Mannheimer-TTIP-EN.pdf\">European Policy Information Center</a>, which \u2013 unforgivably \u2013 is already spelling \u201ccentre\u201d the American way. Epicenter (as this group is acronymically known) is made up of groups, such as the UK\u2019s Institute of Economic Affairs, that are in favour of TTIP. It argues that we shouldn\u2019t worry about ISDS provisions. Why? Because the clause is a time-honoured means whereby corporations protect their investments, and does not undermine EU or member states\u2019 right to pursue legitimate public policy objectives.</p> <p>Or consider food regulations. While the EU has an impressively alliterative <a href=\" http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_food-safety/information_sources/docs/from_farm_to_fork_2004_en.pdf\">\u201cfarm to fork\u201d strategy</a>, for instance, regulating each link in the food chain, Americans pump their cattle and pigs with growth-promoting hormones banned in the EU. As a result, most US beef can\u2019t be sold in the EU.</p> <p>Worse, Americans use 82 pesticides banned in the EU. They wash their chicken in chlorinated water to kill bacteria. Ninety per cent of their soya, cotton and corn is genetically modified, while the EU allows member states to ban GM production. France, for instance, has banned GM, and Gauloises-smoking, beret-wearing toughs now patrol French fields to ensure that the excrescence of GM never sullies la belle France again.</p> <p>So how could we possibly abandon these glorious European standards? The spectre of what lavishly moustachioed French farmer/anti-globalisation activist Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 calls <em>la malbouffe Americaine</em> (rubbish American food) lurks behind the fears of this trading alliance. \u201cYeah?\u201d retort Americans. \u201cSo how come you dumbass Europeans got mired in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/15/horsemeat-scandal-the-essential-guide\">horse-meat scandal in 2013</a> if your food regulations are so darn tootin\u2019?\u201d Which, you have to admit, is a good comeback.</p> <p>Or consider data privacy rights. Don\u2019t Americans realise that us Europeans don\u2019t care to be snooped on by the NSA or have Google peer 24/7 into our very souls? MEPs are worried that TTIP might undermine EU data protection laws, and that\u2019s why they have <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20150330IPR39308/html/TTIP-Trade-agreements-must-not-undermine-EU-data-protection-laws-say-MEPs\">called for</a> an \u201cunambiguous, horizontal, self-standing provision\u201d in it to guarantee citizens\u2019 right to privacy.</p> <p>Can something be horizontal and self-standing at the same time, you ask?

The Institute of Economic Affairs and the Conservative party are united in not being angry. The Labour party is \u2013 surprise! \u2013 conflicted.</p> <p>Let\u2019s consider Labour first. Labour MEP Jude Kirton-Darling, while <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/07/battle-over-ttip-far-over-and-were-not-ready-give-fight welcomes some aspects of TTIP\">arguing</a> that ISDS is a \u201cpara-judicial and opaque system of private arbitration [that] allows companies to sue governments at great cost to the taxpayer\u201d, also says that TTIP \u201ccould present us with a unique chance to regulate globalisation and to promote EU standards\u201d, as well as \u201cproviding a much-needed boost to local economies, support to SMEs and new and exciting jobs and training opportunities\u201d.</p> <p>As for Ukip, Farage and his chums oppose TTIP because they think it\u2019s a smokescreen. It\u2019s not about trade, stupid, it\u2019s about promoting \u201cthe political pretensions of a wannabe European superstate\u201d and \u201csetting up a parallel system that undermines national courts and national legal systems\u201d, as the party\u2019s international trade spokesman <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/the_eu_is_using_ttip_in_the_course_of_its_political_agenda\">William Dartmouth MEP said in the European parliament last month</a>.</p> <p>After the vote went against Ukip\u2019s stance last week, Dartmouth said that the only way citizens can defeat TTIP now is to vote to leave the European Union. But that\u2019s Ukip\u2019s answer to everything.</p> <p>As for War on Want, its views are more typical of the pressure groups, unions, charities, NGOs and environmentalists that oppose TTIP. There are, for example, 480 such groups affiliated to the Berlin-based <a href=\"https://stop-ttip.org\">Stop TTIP campaign</a>, whose supporting organisations include trade unions like the NUT, NGOs such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace and, my personal favourite, the Pirate Parties<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_of_Greece\"> of Greece</a>, Germany, Slovenia and the Netherlands, which have no leaders but a splendid flag. The campaign has a 2.3 million-signature petition calling on the EU to \u201cstop these sinister trade deals\u201d, by which it means both TTIP and CETA.</p> <p>One of War On Want\u2019s major concerns is that TTIP is being negotiated in secret. And with good cause: what nobody seems to have pointed out yet is that if TTIP negotiations do continue, as expected, until next year at the earliest, often in secret with (I suspect) all sorts of complicated car switcheroos, dead letter drops and tooled-up security johnnies in shades talking furtively into their wrists, the costs of negotiations might outweigh any supposed benefits of what they\u2019re negotiating about.</p> <p>But <em>are</em> TTIP negotiations being conducted in secret? Giacomo Lev Mannheimer of Istituto Bruno Leoni argues that is <a href=\"http://www.epicenternetwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IBL_Focus_250-Mannheimer-TTIP-EN.pdf\">another conspiracy theory</a>. And, indeed, he points to the dismal truth that there are lots and lots and lots of TTIP-related documents about its benefits, impact on public services, food and agriculture rules. Mannheimer makes a good point, though critics argue that the real meat of negotiations takes place elsewhere and ordinary European citizens don\u2019t get a say in them.</p> <p>What Mannheimer doesn\u2019t consider is the more disturbing truth that there is an inverse relationship between the number of funny videos on YouTube and the user traffic on European commission websites relating to TTIP.</p> <p>Indeed, if TTIP is about liberalising the parameters of boring, there are some of us who are prepared to fight back. And when I say \u201cfight back\u201d, I mean kick back on a sofa <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tntOCGkgt98.\">watching kittens get tickled</a>.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Greece debt crisis: Athens stock market ends 16% lower  as manufacturing plunges - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Greek stock market ended 16.23% lower, its worst daily performance since 1985 when modern records began, with banking shares inevitably the main fallers. There were only nine gainers, including furniture maker Dromeas which gained around 29% after announcing - somewhat ironically given Greece\u2019s problems with the EU - that it had wond a \u20ac30m deal to supply European Commission offices. Elsewhere though, European shares held up remarkably well despite the slump in Athens. For a start, the decline had been expected after a five week suspension of the Greek market. There were also some reasonable eurozone PMI manufacturing figures (ignoring a shocking decline in Greece). And even though Greek banks dropped up to 30%, elsewhere the sector was buoyed by positive results from HSBC and Commerzbank. The UK market was another exception, however, hit by a fall in mining shares following poor data from China, a key consumer of commodities. Overall the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 7.66 points or 0.11% lower at 6688.62 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.19% to 11, 443.72 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.75% higher at 5120.52 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.75% to 23,714.38 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.76% at 11,265.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 167 points or 0.95% , following disappointing consumer spending and manufacturing data. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. And a bank on short-selling which came into effect when capital controls were introduced at the end of June and due to end today looks like it will be extended: More meetings due between Greek officials and its creditors: Meanwhile Brent crude has dropped below $50 a barrel for the first time since January: Oil has been hit by worries about the Chinese economy - with another set of weak data in the shape of the PMI manufacturing index out earlier - and the rest of the global economy. Demand seems to be slowing at the same time as there is global oversupply. As the Athen market fell sharply on its first day of trading for five weeks, index provider MSCI has said it may reclassify its Greek market index from emerging to standalone status. It said it may launch a consultation on such a move if capital controls continued. It said: If there are continuing significant restrictive measures impacting the accessibility of the Greek equity market by international institutional investors, MSCI may potentially launch a consultation on a proposal regarding the reclassification of the MSCI Greece index to standalone market status from emerging markets status. Here\u2019s our full story on the UK government\u2019s plan to begin selling its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland: BREAKING NEWS The UK government plans to sell part of its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. It will dispose of 5.2% of the bank via a placing to institutional investors. Here\u2019s Markit\u2019s summary of the global manufacturing PMIs for July, and it makes grim reading for Greece and its government: The damage to the Greek economy is so severe that even if a third bailout plan is agreed, it is not likely to last very long and the country is still on course to leave the eurozone. That is the view of Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, who writes: The scale of the damage done to the Greek economy by the country\u2019s renewed crisis and imposition of capital controls looks set to be far worse than the provisional plans for a third bailout envisaged and suggests that Greece is still likely to leave the currency union at some point. Even before the Greek capital controls were implemented at the end of last month, the economy was being hit by the generally adverse effects of the renewed crisis. Although Greek GDP contracted by only 0.2% in the first quarter, the available hard data suggest that it did so much more sharply in the second quarter. ...But the damage to the economy appears to have increased much further under the capital controls. Last week\u2019s EC business &amp; consumer survey revealed a sharp slump in economic sentiment across all of the main sectors of the economy in July, pointing to the likelihood of much weaker levels of activity. And this picture was supported by July\u2019s manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, which included a precipitous collapse in the output index from June\u2019s reading of 44.8 to an incredibly weak 18.8. ...Of course, such extreme weakness may not last long if the bailout plan under discussion allows the capital controls to soon be lifted and brings the crisis to at least a temporary end. But it is far from clear that this will happen. And even if it does, sharp declines in the PMI sub-orders indices in July suggest that it would take some time for growth to recover back towards \u201cnormal\u201d rates. The upshot is that the scale of the damage to the Greek economy from the crisis and imposition of capital controls looks set to be worse than most forecasters, including ourselves, had envisaged. ...Perhaps more importantly, the very low starting point suggests that, even with a stronger quarterly performance, next year\u2019s average growth figure could be even weaker at -5% or below, no doubt much worse than any figure envisaged until very recently by Greece\u2019s creditors. Against that economic backdrop, the requirement in the current bailout plan for Greece to build up sizeable primary budget surpluses over the next few years looks extremely demanding, if not utterly fantastical. And that, in turn, casts serious doubts over whether the plan, if it is even implemented, will last for very long. In short, the acute weakness of the Greek economy continues to point to the country\u2019s exit from the euro-zone in the not too distant future. On the Athens market fall, market analyst Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets UK said: The Athens Stock Exchange plummeted on Monday; its first day of trading in five months but an improving manufacturing outlook meant other European stock markets gained as a destination for funds coming out of Greece. Greek bank stocks went immediately limit down 30% with the rest of the market not faring much better, down as much as 23% on the open. It makes sense to see these kinds of declines given the Greece\u2019s flirtation with an exit from the Eurozone since the stock exchange was closed five weeks ago. That said, dropping by over 20% in a single day is almost unprecedented for the benchmark stock index of a developed country- and really is an utter pasting. It puts recent moves in China to shame. The uncertain solvency of Greek banks had investors moving hand over fist to dump the shares as quickly as possible before the Athens Stock Exchange\u2019s maximum loss for an individual issue was reached and trading halted. The Athens stock market has closed sharply lower on its first day of trading for five weeks, but it has ended off its worst levels. It finished 16.23% lower at 668.06 have initially dropped by around 23%. Banks however plunged 30%, hitting the daily volatility limit, with analysts expecting further falls on Tuesday. One fund manager told Reuters: Market value is being destroyed on very light volumes as buyers stay away from bank shares. It will take some days for the market to balance out. As we reported earlier, representatives of Greece\u2019s lenders met labour minister Giorgos Katrougalos today. Now Reuters is reporting labour ministry officials saying that Greece and its lenders have agreed that new pension reforms will not have any effect on anyone who was eligible to retire by the end of June. As part of the agreement to open talks about a third bailout, Greece agreed to implement pension reforms including scrapping early retirement and raising the retirement age limit by the end of October. The ISM report has been confirmed, and ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls number, analysts have been looking at the implications of today\u2019s data: Here\u2019s our full report on the Tom Hayes Libor verdict: Back with the US data and James Knightly at ING says the US Federal Reserve is likely to raise rates in September despite the weaker than expected ISM data: ISM manufacturing index appears to have been leaked a little early with the headline index coming in at 52.7 for July versus 53.5 in June. It is also weaker than the 53.8 consensus estimate. The report in general is mixed to slightly positive. On the positive side the output and new orders components have both risen (output up 2 at 56.0 and new orders up 0.5 at 56.5). The new orders component is at its highest this year. This suggests decent growth in manufacturing activity both for July and coming months. However, the employment component fell to 52.7 from 55.5, which is a bit of a concern given that the labour market is key to the timing of the first Fed rate hike - last week\u2019s FOMC statement indicated that officials want to see \u201csome\u201d further improvement before tightening policy. That said, the employment component remains above the 6M average of 51.6 so it isn\u2019t terrible and doesn\u2019t alter the outlook for a 200,000 p;us reading for non-farm payrolls on Friday. Given the positive growth story and the likelihood of a decent payrolls figure both this month and next we think that the Fed will deliver a September hike. (Let\u2019s hope the leaked ISM figure is correct.....) BREAKING NEWS Away from the eurozone crisis for a moment and Tom Hayes, the former UBS and Citi trader, has been found guilty of all eight charges of conspiracy to defraud in the Libor trial. The US Markit PMI for manufacturing is out, and is steady at 53.8 in July from June, exactly as expected. The US ISM manufacturing survey for July - due in around 20 minutes - appears to have leaked early: This is lower than the 53.6 expected. On Wall Street, which has just opened, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is showing an initial 19 point or 0.11% decline. The rival Markit index is imminent. Some possible good news for Greek banks. The country is unlikely to ask for an increase in emergency funding from the European Central Bank for weeks, according to a Reuters report citing two sources, because its liquidity buffer has risen thanks to cash inflows and help from the central bank: The bank liquidity buffer has grown to about \u20ac5bn from \u20ac1bn to \u20ac2bn at the height of Greece\u2019s debt crisis, thanks to two Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) increases from the ECB, tax and tourism inflows, and pension payments, said one of the sources, who asked not to be named. Greek banks, closed for much of July, rely on emergency liquidity from the ECB and limit cash withdrawals to \u20ac420 per week to prevent a run on banks. The capital controls have stopped the exodus of cash. And the increase in the buffer indicates that money is leaving banks slower than feared and they retain at least some confidence. \u201cThere\u2019s been relative little outflows and there was actually a week in July when there was a net inflow into the banks,\u201d one source said. Another source close to the process added: \u201cThere is an adequate liquidity buffer, there is no reason to ask for an increase in the ELA cap.\u201d The ECB increased ELA to Greek banks twice in July by \u20ac900m each time and ELA is now capped at around \u20ac9bn, of which about \u20ac5bn is unused. Global banks may have reduced their exposure to Greece, but not entirely: Greece\u2019s lenders are continuing their meetings with officials in Athens today, including labour minister Giorgos Katrougalos. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: Declan Costello from the European Commission, Rasmus Rueffer of the European Central Bank, Nicola Giammarioli from the European Stability Mechanism and Delia Velculescu of the International Monetary Fund met Katrougalos at his office for talks that lasted just under two hours. Ministry sources said the aim of the discussions was for the visiting officials and Katrougalos to acquaint themselves with each other. The talks were held at the minister\u2019s suggestion, sources added. The government said that the main issues the four officials would be discussing on Monday are related to the justice system and combatting corruption. Tax issues are also on the agenda for Monday\u2019s talks. Could Greece need a second bridging loan? In July, after much tortuous negotiation, the country received \u20ac7.16bn which it immediately used to make a due payment to the European Central Bank and to pay its arrears to the International Monetary Fund. Now talks are underway about a third bailout, but with another \u20ac3.2bn due to be paid to the ECB on 20 August, the timing to get everything signed and sealed looks increasingly tight. Hence the suggestion that another bridging loan of perhaps \u20ac5bn might be necessary. Open Europe writes: Focus magazine reported over the weekend that the German government is increasingly pessimistic about the negotiations over the third bailout being wrapped up any time soon. The magazine cites unnamed government sources suggesting that the special session of the Bundestag slated for mid-August in order to approve the bailout may have to be moved. This is just one in an increasingly lengthy line of reports suggesting that the bailout negotiations may not be completed in time. As a reminder.. Greece has to repay \u20ac3.2bn to the ECB on 20 August. In order for this money to be released in time approval in a number of national parliaments needs to begin on the 12/13 August according to reports. This means the negotiations have to be completed by 10/11 of August with approval from the eurozone finance ministers coming quickly afterwards. Of course, we have seen such dates fudged before (they always seem to overestimate the time needed for national approval to give some wiggle room). But in any case there is probably between a week and two weeks before the third bailout needs to be signed, sealed and delivered. This looks incredibly optimistic \u2013 it means agreeing a three year reform programme, how much and when funds will be released, when and to what extent debt relief will be discussed or even take place and whether the IMF will be involved, amongst many other incredibly thorny issues. How much would a second bridge loan total and where would it come from? The agreement reached between Greece and its creditors noted that it would probably need around \u20ac5bn in August on top of the \u20ac7.16bn it received in July. Given the issues we encountered around the previous bridge loan, it is likely to once again come from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) (though I maintain that other options are on the table). There remains just enough in the EFSM to provide a second bridge loan to Greece. Since the final tranche of the Portuguese bailout was not paid there was \u20ac13.2bn left before the \u20ac7.16bn disbursement of the first bridge loan, meaning there is conveniently the exact amount needed remaining. ...The original bridge loan was a bit of a disaster, at least in political terms. It managed to anger a number of non-Euro countries and rowed back on a previous European Council decision. It was also incredibly circular \u2013 the EU lent to Greece which repaid the ECB, the Eurozone states then guaranteed the non-Euro share of this loan with income from the ECB off the back of income from Greek bonds. So why would the eurozone want to go through this exercise again? Well... it has little choice if it doesn\u2019t want Greece to default on the ECB. However, it also settles a tricky problem for the eurozone \u2013 whether Greece will have to do further reforms before cash is released. By virtue of having to draw up a new EFSM bridge loan and have non-eurozone countries involved there will have to be a new short term reform programme tied to the loan. It also reduces the size of the first tranche of the loan and the total amount that needs to come from the eurozone bailout fund the ESM (though overall this makes little difference given the indemnity for non-eurozone states). These are not huge issues but may marginally be useful. Whether the UK\u2019s chancellor George Osborne and other non-eurozone ministers would be keen, is of course another matter. Here\u2019s the AP take on today\u2019s slump in the Athens stock market: Greece\u2019s main stock index plunged over 22% as it reopened Monday after a five-week closure, giving investors their first opportunity since late June to react to the country\u2019s latest economic crisis. Greek bank stocks suffered the most, hitting or nearing the daily trading limit of a 30% loss. Markets in the rest of Europe, however, were largely unaffected. The Athens Stock Exchange and Greek banks were closed on June 29, when the government imposed controls on money withdrawals and transfers to keep a run on bank deposits from causing the financial system to collapse. Banks have since reopened, while maintaining strict cash withdrawal limits. Greece is expected to head back into recession in 2015 after briefly emerging from a six-year contraction due to the effects of capital controls and months of uncertainty over the country\u2019s future in the euro. A monthly survey of business and consumer confidence, the Economic Sentiment Indicator, fell for a fifth consecutive month in July to its worst level since October 2012. \u201cThe negative development is the result of the sharp deterioration in business expectations in all areas, but also a recent and significant decline in consumer confidence,\u201d said the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research, or IOBE, which conducts the survey. Greece is currently in intense negotiations with bailout lenders in an effort to negotiate the terms of a massive new rescue package in the next two weeks. The country needs to complete the talks and get more loans before August 20, when it has a repayment to make worth more than \u20ac3bn to the European Central Bank. The euro is under pressure after the plunge on the Athens stock market. Having traded as high as $1.099 earlier is it now down at $1.096, although losses were mitigated by the reasonably positive manufacturing data for the eurozone as a whole. More downbeat data from Greece. The country\u2019s economic sentiment index fell sharply to 81.3 points in July from 90.7, according to the Institute for Economic and Industrial Research. This is the lowest reading since October 2012. The effect of capital controls could not be fully assessed since they were still in place, said the institute, but they would add a further burden to an already shrinking economy. Elsewhere though, European markets are shrugging off the slump on the Athens exchange. After all, the decline was not exactly unexpected, not least given the falls seen in the US ADRs of Greek banks. Strong results from HSBC and Commerzbank in German helped offset the Greek situation and the continuing worries about China in the wake of yet more weak data. So Germany\u2019s Dax is currently up around 0.4%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.21% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 0.46%. However the FTSE 100 has slipped 0.19%, hit by a fall in mining shares after the poor Chinese manufacturing figures. The Athens market has recovered slightly from its worst levels, but is still down 19.25% at the moment. Banks, inevitably, are the worst performers: Meanwhile in the UK, the manufacturing PMI has edged up from 51.4 in June to 51.9, slightly better than forecasts of a rise to 51.6. But new orders grew at their slowest pace in nearly a year, according to Markit, and to put things in context, the June figure was the lowest level in more than two years. The UK recovery looks very much dependent on consumer spending, given the weak prospects for exports to the eurozone and the strong pound. Rob Dobson at Markit said: Although a tick higher in the headline PMI breaks the decelerating trend in UK manufacturing, growth in the sector remains near stagnant and suggests that the sector is continuing to act as a drag on the economy. Economists agree that the weakness in exports could prove a problem. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, said: No two surveys on UK manufacturing seem to chime with each other currently with some painting a promising picture and others a bleaker one. However, what is clear is that domestic demand is still driving growth and with continuing strength in the sterling-euro exchange rate restricting the competitiveness of our exporters, the exporting surge the sector craves to boost growth and help rebalance the recovery seems further away. Elsewhere there has been a mixed picture for the monthly manufacturing indices. But the overall eurozone performance was fairly steady despite the Greek crisis: Markit said: The eurozone manufacturing sector continued to expand at a solid steady pace at the start of the third quarter, as continued growth in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Austria and Germany offset the deepest contraction of the Greek manufacturing sector in the survey history. With capital controls, banks closed and slumping demand, Greece\u2019s factory output fell to its lowest level on record in July. The manufacturing sector - which makes up about 10% of the economy - fell to 30.2 points according to Markit\u2019s montly purchasing managers index. Anything below 50 is a sign of contraction. This is the worst performance since the company started compiling the data in 1999. Markit said:\uf0a7 July saw factory production in Greece contract sharply amid an unprecedented drop in new orders and difficulties in purchasing raw materials. \uf0a7 The main causes of the contraction in output were twofold: production requirements diminished as new orders plummeted while manufacturers had difficulty in sourcing materials and semi-completed goods for use in the production process. July\u2019s sharp decrease in the level of new business at manufacturers surpassed the previous record set in February 2012. Panel members commented on the impact of capital controls on demand, and also cited a generally uncertain operating environment which further weighed on sales. Phil Smith, Markit economist said: Manufacturing output collapsed in July as the debt crisis came to a head. Factories faced a record drop in new orders and were often unable to acquire the inputs they needed, particularly from abroad, as bank closures and capital restrictions badly hampered normal business activity. Demand was hit amid the heightened uncertainty surrounding Greece\u2019s future, leading both total new business and exports to contract sharply, and it remains to be seen how long it takes these to recover. Although manufacturing represents only a small proportion of Greece\u2019s total productive output, the sheer magnitude of the downturn sends a worrying signal for the health of the economy as a whole. Heavy losses in Athens as trading resumes The market has opened and it\u2019s not pretty. The Athex Composite has plunged more than 20%, to 615.12. The falls are even deeper in financials, with banking shares down by as much as 30% \u2013 the maximum allowed. Market observers caution, however, that we will not know the true picture until things settle down a bit in a few hours\u2019 time. China woes deepen on manufacturing slowdown The latest data from China is not good, reinforcing fears about the health of its economy and the knock-on effect on the rest of the world. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on the data: China\u2019s factory activity shrank more than initially estimated in July, contracting the most in two years as new orders fell and dashing hopes that the world\u2019s second-largest economy may be steadying, a private survey showed on Monday. The report followed a downbeat official survey on Saturday which showed growth at manufacturing firms unexpectedly stalled, reinforcing views that the struggling economy needs more stimulus even as it faces fresh risks from a stock market slump. Fears of a full-blown market crash have added a new sense of urgency for policymakers in Beijing, with many analysts expecting more support measures to be rolled out within weeks. The final, private Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) dropped to 47.8 in July, the lowest since July 2013, from 49.4 in June. That was worse than a preliminary reading of 48.2 and marked the fifth straight month of contraction. New orders contracted after growing in June, while factory output shrank for the third consecutive month to hit a trough of 47.1, a level not seen in more than 3-1/2 years.\u201d Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the corporate and business world, global markets and the eurozone crisis. It\u2019s a big day in Athens as the stock market reopens there after its five-week suspension. Trading is scheduled to resume at 8.30am London time (10.30am Athens time) and it\u2019s likely to be a bit of a bloodbath, with falls of up to 30% predicted. Banking stocks are expected to be hardest hit. Here\u2019s Heather Stewart\u2019s story on what to expect. Just because the market\u2019s reopening, doesn\u2019t mean things are back to normal; far from it. As Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK says: \u201cWhile it would be easy to suggest that today\u2019s reopening of the Greek stock market is a key step on the road to some form of normalisation, it is likely to be anything but. Aside from the fact that we could well see some big losses, there is the small matter that not only are the internal politics in Greece likely to remain difficult it is also likely to be extremely problematic to reconcile the positions the divergent positions of the IMF and Germany on debt relief, particularly given the proximity of the next debt deadline on 20 August.\u201d We\u2019ve also had some poor manufacturing data from China; the eurozone and UK figures are due later. On the corporate front, Europe\u2019s largest bank, HSBC, has been hit by another $1.5bn of litigation costs but its first-half profits are ahead of forecasts. The government has also cut its stake in Lloyds Banking group again, taking it to below 14%. Today may also be the day we get the verdict in the Tom Hayes Libor trial. We\u2019ll be at the court in Southwark to bring you the verdict as it\u2019s announced. We\u2019ll bring you more on all this throughout the day.",

Although Greek GDP contracted by only 0.2% in the first quarter, the available hard data suggest that it did so much more sharply in the second quarter.</p> <p>...But the damage to the economy appears to have increased much further under the capital controls. Last week\u2019s EC business &amp; consumer survey revealed a sharp slump in economic sentiment across all of the main sectors of the economy in July, pointing to the likelihood of much weaker levels of activity.</p> <p>And this picture was supported by July\u2019s manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, which included a precipitous collapse in the output index from June\u2019s reading of 44.8 to an incredibly weak 18.8. </p> <p>...Of course, such extreme weakness may not last long if the bailout plan under discussion allows the capital controls to soon be lifted and brings the crisis to at least a temporary end. But it is far from clear that this will happen. And even if it does, sharp declines in the PMI sub-orders indices in July suggest that it would take some time for growth to recover back towards \u201cnormal\u201d rates.</p> <p>The upshot is that the scale of the damage to the Greek economy from the crisis and imposition of capital controls looks set to be worse than most forecasters, including ourselves, had envisaged.</p> <p>...Perhaps more importantly, the very low starting point suggests that, even with a stronger quarterly performance, next year\u2019s average growth figure could be even weaker at -5% or below, no doubt much worse than any figure envisaged until very recently by Greece\u2019s creditors.</p> <p>Against that economic backdrop, the requirement in the current bailout plan for Greece to build up sizeable primary budget surpluses over the next few years looks extremely demanding, if not utterly fantastical. And that, in turn, casts serious doubts over whether the plan, if it is even implemented, will last for very long. In short, the acute weakness of the Greek economy continues to point to the country\u2019s exit from the euro-zone in the not too distant future.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55bf8176e4b0af3e9ff2b5f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-03T14:59:08.015Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the Athens market fall, market analyst Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets UK said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Athens Stock Exchange plummeted on Monday; its first day of trading in five months but an improving manufacturing outlook meant other European stock markets gained as a destination for funds coming out of Greece.</p> <p>Greek bank stocks went immediately limit down 30% with the rest of the market not faring much better, down as much as 23% on the open.

Hence the suggestion that another bridging loan of perhaps \u20ac5bn might be necessary. Open Europe<a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/a-second-bridge-loan-for-greece-on-the-horizon/\"><strong> writes</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/staatsverschuldung/griechenland-krise-zeitplan-nicht-zu-halten-berlin-sieht-athen-hilfen-in-gefahr_id_4853359.html\">Focus magazine reported</a> over the weekend that the German government is increasingly pessimistic about the negotiations over the third bailout being wrapped up any time soon. The magazine cites unnamed government sources suggesting that the special session of the Bundestag slated for mid-August in order to approve the bailout may have to be moved. This is just one in an increasingly lengthy line of reports suggesting that the bailout negotiations may not be completed in time.</p> <p>As a reminder.. Greece has to repay \u20ac3.2bn to the ECB on 20 August. In order for this money to be released in time approval in a number of national parliaments needs to begin on the 12/13 August according to reports. This means the negotiations have to be completed by 10/11 of August with approval from the eurozone finance ministers coming quickly afterwards. Of course, we have seen such dates fudged before (they always seem to overestimate the time needed for national approval to give some wiggle room). But in any case there is probably between a week and two weeks before the third bailout needs to be signed, sealed and delivered. This looks incredibly optimistic \u2013 it means agreeing a three year reform programme, how much and when funds will be released, when and to what extent debt relief will be discussed or even take place and whether the <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/how-could-the-third-greek-bailout-change-without-the-imf/\">IMF will be involved</a>, amongst many other incredibly thorny issues.</p> <p>How much would a second bridge loan total and where would it come from?</p> <p>The agreement reached between Greece and its creditors noted that it would probably need around \u20ac5bn in August on top of the \u20ac7.16bn it received in July. Given the issues we encountered around the previous bridge loan, it is likely to once again come from <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu_borrower/efsm/index_en.htm\">the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)</a> (though I maintain that <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/bridge-financing-for-greece-what-are-the-options-and-should-the-uk-be-involved/\">other options are on the table</a>).</p> <p>There remains just enough in the EFSM to provide a second bridge loan to Greece. Since the final tranche of the Portuguese bailout was not paid there was \u20ac13.2bn left before the \u20ac7.16bn disbursement of the first bridge loan, meaning there is conveniently the exact amount needed remaining.</p> <p>...The original bridge loan <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/will-the-eu-regret-dragging-the-uk-into-greek-bailout/\">was a bit of a disaster</a>, at least in political terms. It managed to anger a number of non-Euro countries and rowed back on a previous European Council decision. It was also incredibly circular \u2013 the EU lent to Greece which repaid the ECB, the Eurozone states then guaranteed the non-Euro share of this loan with income from the ECB off the back of income from Greek bonds.</p> <p>So why would the eurozone want to go through this exercise again? Well... it has little choice if it doesn\u2019t want Greece to default on the ECB. However, it also settles a tricky problem for the eurozone \u2013 whether Greece will have to do further reforms before cash is released. By virtue of having to draw up a new EFSM bridge loan and have non-eurozone countries involved there will have to be a new short term reform programme tied to the loan. It also reduces the size of the first tranche of the loan and the total amount that needs to come from the eurozone bailout fund the ESM (though overall this makes little difference given the indemnity for non-eurozone states). These are not huge issues but may marginally be useful.</p> </blockquote> <p>Whether the UK\u2019s chancellor George Osborne and other non-eurozone ministers would be keen, is of course another matter.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55bf44bfe4b00b7765fe3de5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-03T10:44:27.886Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the AP take on today\u2019s slump in the Athens stock market:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece\u2019s main stock index plunged over 22% as it reopened Monday after a five-week closure, giving investors their first opportunity since late June to react to the country\u2019s latest economic crisis.</p> <p>Greek bank stocks suffered the most, hitting or nearing the daily trading limit of a 30% loss.

As Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK says: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWhile it would be easy to suggest that today\u2019s reopening of the Greek stock market is a key step on the road to some form of normalisation, it is likely to be anything but. </p> <p>Aside from the fact that we could well see some big losses, there is the small matter that not only are the internal politics in Greece likely to remain difficult it is also likely to be extremely problematic to reconcile the positions the divergent positions of the IMF and Germany on debt relief, particularly given the proximity of the next debt deadline on 20 August.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve also had some poor manufacturing data from China; the eurozone and UK figures are due later.</p> <p>On the corporate front, Europe\u2019s largest bank, HSBC, has been hit by another $1.5bn of litigation costs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/hsbc-profits-rise-10-boosted-by-bumper-hong-kong-earnings\">but its first-half profits are ahead of forecasts</a>. The government has also cut its stake in Lloyds Banking group again, taking it to below 14%. </p> <p>Today may also be the day we get the verdict in the Tom Hayes Libor trial. We\u2019ll be at the court in Southwark to bring you the verdict as it\u2019s announced.</p> <p>We\u2019ll bring you more on all this throughout the day.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-03T08:46:18.007Z\">at 9.46am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "It was, as Stephen Hester described it, the biggest financial time bomb in history and it needed to be defused. When Hester took over as chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland in October 2008, and as \u00a345bn of taxpayer money was being pumped in to the business, the once proud Edinburgh-based bank was on the brink of an implosion that could have brought down the UK economy with it. Its assets were \u00a32.2tn \u2013 more than double the size of the economy \u2013 and it was running out of cash. Alistair Darling, the chancellor at the time, has described how he was told one day in early October 2008, at the depths of the crisis, that RBS had enough money to keep operating for two or three hours. Unlike the queues that formed outside Northern Rock branches a year before, this was a less visible bank run: major banks and companies were withdrawing money from RBS at a ruinous pace. It ended in the biggest bank bailout in history and a massive restructuring that, even seven years on, is far from complete. The hubristic growth that ultimately toppled RBS took place over a 10-year period. The takeover of NatWest, a languishing UK high street bank in 2000, had turned RBS from a big player in Edinburgh to one that shot to prominence in the UK. A series of acquisitions of banks in the US had given it a strong presence in North America, and then the fight for control of Dutch bank ABN Amro had expanded its reach into investment banking and propelled RBS on to the global stage. It was the latter deal, just as the credit crunch was gripping financial markets in 2007, that also helped bring down RBS. The report into what went wrong at RBS, published in 2011, said there not been enough due diligence into the takeover. The report also cited a string of other reasons, including \u201cunderlying deficiencies in RBS management, governance and culture,\u201d as well as its wafer-thin capital ratios. At its worst point, the core capital ratio \u2013 a measure of a bank\u2019s financial strength \u2013 of RBS was sliced to 4%. As a result of the taxpayer bailout and a dramatic reduction in the size of the bank, that capital ratio now stands at around 12%. The global ambitions pursued by Fred Goodwin \u2013 stripped of his knighthood in 2012 \u2013 have now been abandoned. Goodwin had planted an RBS flag in more than 50 countries. Hester kept 38 of the international outposts before he was forced out in 2013. His successor, Ross McEwan, has set a target for RBS to be based in 13 countries in the next four years. One of the casualties is Stamford, the US headquarters that Goodwin signed off just before he was pushed out. It was the symbol of his global ambition for the bank, which had already moved to a \u00a3350m mini-village in the Gogarburn campus headquarters at the edge of Edinburgh airport. Stamford housed one of the biggest trading floors in the world, bigger than any of the US investment banks when it opened just as the bailout was taking place. But in April this year the bank took a \u00a3227m hit as it wrote down the value of the building, whose empty floors are now just as symbolic of the latest restructuring being undertaken by McEwan. The investment bank, once the powerhouse of RBS, is being wound down by McEwan. As many as four out of five jobs \u2013 around 14,000 \u2013 are expected to be gone from the investment bank as the retrenchment takes place over the next four years. The division employed 24,000 before the bailout. In total, 90,000 jobs have gone since the bailout, although the workforce still stands at 110,000. With the international focus abandoned, around 80% of the bank\u2019s revenue is now generated inside the UK, compared with less than 50% at the time taxpayers stepped in. The UK high street, rather than Wall Street, is now being primed as the engine for growth, although McEwan would be the first to admit that there is still more to be done. The bank is yet to report an annual profit. The record \u00a324bn of losses reported for 2008 has been followed by annual losses every year since. Once those losses are totted up, RBS has lost more money than the \u00a345bn pumped in by taxpayers, including spending \u00a310bn on fines and compensation to clean up misdeeds from the past. The share price also tells the story. At its peak in February 2007 the shares changed hands at more than \u00a360 in a market pumped up by its global ambitions. In the depths of the crisis in January 2009 they dived to just above \u00a31 and now change hands at closer to \u00a33.40. The first share sale leaves the taxpayer nursing multimillion pound losses as the 79% stake in the bank was bought at an average price of \u00a35.02. Investment bankers at Rothschild have told George Osborne that that there is little immediate chance of the shares ever getting back to that level, never mind the heady pre-crisis peaks.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has kicked off the first sale of shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland since it was rescued in 2008, at a likely loss of around \u00a31bn to the taxpayer. The chancellor faced criticism from Labour politicians and trade union officials that he should have waited for the bank to achieve more deep-rooted reform before embarking on a major privatisation. The sale of some \u00a32bn worth of shares to City investors \u2013 representing a stake of just over 5% \u2013 is to take place overnight on Monday and should reduce the taxpayers\u2019 shareholding to around 73% once the initial tranche is sold off. The chancellor had signalled in his Mansion House speech in June that he was ready to start selling the stake even though the shares were worth less than the \u00a345bn the taxpayer paid for them. But he had attempted to justify the sale on the basis that losses on RBS would be outweighed by profits from other bailouts. The much-anticipated announcement was made after the stock market had closed on Monday, with RBS shares ending the day 1.3% lower at 337p. This is below the average 502p at which they were bought in 2008 and 2009 \u2013 and indicates a loss of around \u00a31bn on the portion being sold overnight. It was reported that they were being sold at 330p each. If all the shares were sold at this price, it would represent a \u00a315bn loss to the taxpayer. The precise value at which the shares have been sold will be announced on Tuesday morning once fund managers around the globe have agreed to buy them. Osborne sanctioned the sale of the first 600m shares on the advice of James Leigh-Pemberton, the head of UK Financial Investments, the body which looks after the taxpayer stakes in the bailed-out banks. The Treasury said: \u201cUK Financial Investments [UKFI] advised the chancellor [on Monday] it would be appropriate to conduct the first sale of the government\u2019s shareholding in the Royal Bank of Scotland. The chancellor agrees with that advice and has authorised the process to begin. \u201cThe government set out its objectives for its shareholdings in the banks in the chancellor\u2019s annual Mansion House speech in June 2013 \u2013 getting the best value for the taxpayer, maximising support for the economy and restoring them to private ownership \u2013 and as set out in that address, the government will only conclude a sale if these objectives are met.\u201d The shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, said Osborne needed to justify the price, especially as the bank had warned it faces a penalty from US regulators relating to the sale of US mortgage bonds. \u201cLabour has always supported the eventual return of RBS to the private sector, but taxpayers who bailed out the bank will want their money back and will be suspicious of any fire sale,\u201d he said. Only days after RBS had warned that it faced the punishment in the US and a raft of further penalties, officials at the Unite trade union urged the government to hold on to its stake. Rob MacGregor, national officer for finance at Unite, said: \u201cAs long as mis-selling remains and the lessons of 2008 are ignored, it is reckless for the chancellor to sell off the public stake and give up the potential for scrutiny and transparency that should come with it.\u201d But Simon Walker, head of the Institute of Directors, welcomed the sale as \u201canother step towards recovering what should be the normal position, where the taxpayer does not own significant numbers of shares in the high street banks\u201d. The release of the bank\u2019s first half figures on Friday had provided the first opportunity to start selling shares, even though the bank reported a loss of \u00a3153m as it was hit by \u00a31.3bn of charges to cover fines and compensation to customers. A price of 407p has also been been cited as a breakeven level for the government stake while UKFI has indicated that if all the fees paid by RBS to the government are included, the breakeven price could be 441p. UKFI had told Osborne when he presented his budget in July, his first in government with a Conservative majority, that at least \u00a32bn of share sales could be achieved by April 2016. Under the terms of the sale announced by UKFI no more shares in RBS will be sold for 90 days although this does not preclude further share sales before April. The sale of Lloyds Banking Group shares started two years ago and on Monday the Treasury stake sunk to below 14% after another portion of shares were sold. The stake stood at 43% at the time of the bailout, when Lloyds was rescuing HBOS. Osborne said: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news that we\u2019ve sold more shares in Lloyds bank, taking the total recovered to almost \u00a314bn. I am determined to build on this success, and to continue to return Lloyds to the private sector and reduce our national debt.\u201d",

Rob MacGregor, national officer for finance at Unite, said: \u201cAs long as mis-selling remains and the lessons of 2008 are ignored, it is reckless for the chancellor to sell off the public stake and give up the potential for scrutiny and transparency that should come with it.\u201d</p> <p>But Simon Walker, head of the Institute of Directors, welcomed the sale as \u201canother step towards recovering what should be the normal position, where the taxpayer does not own significant numbers of shares in the high street banks\u201d.</p> <p>The release of the bank\u2019s first half figures on Friday had provided the first opportunity to start selling shares, even though the bank reported a loss of \u00a3153m as it was hit by \u00a31.3bn of charges to cover fines and compensation to customers.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/01/lloyds-horta-osorio-bonus-ppi-loss\">price</a> of 407p has also been been cited as a breakeven level for the government stake while UKFI has indicated that if all the fees paid by RBS to the government are included, the breakeven price could be 441p.<br></p> <p>UKFI had told Osborne when he presented his budget in July, his first in government with a Conservative majority, that at least \u00a32bn of share sales could be achieved by April 2016. Under the terms of the sale <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/uk-financial-inv-ld/rns/intention-to-dispose-of-approx-5-2--of-rbs/201508031645189440U/\">announced by UKFI</a> no more shares in RBS will be sold for 90 days although this does not preclude further share sales before April.</p> <p>The sale of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/17/government-resume-sell-off-stake-lloyds-banking-group-election\">Lloyds Banking Group shares</a> started two years ago and on Monday the Treasury <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/government-sells-stake-lloyds\"> stake sunk to below 14%</a> after another portion of shares were sold. The stake stood at 43% at the time of the bailout, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/marketturmoil.hbosbusiness\">Lloyds was rescuing HBOS</a>. </p> <p>Osborne said: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news that we\u2019ve sold more shares in Lloyds bank, taking the total recovered to almost \u00a314bn. I am determined to build on this success, and to continue to return Lloyds to the private sector and reduce our national debt.\u201d</p> <p> </p>",

    "webTitle": "Strong pound holding back UK exports, says key survey", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The strength of the pound is holding back UK exports and keeping factory output barely above recession levels despite a rise in activity in the eurozone. The monthly health check from the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply/Markit found that buoyant consumer spending helped British industry edge up from a 26-month low in June. But the survey of purchasing managers said business conditions were \u201crelatively subdued\u201d and below the average seen since the economy began to recover in early 2013. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \u201cAlthough an uptick in the headline PMI breaks the decelerating trend in UK manufacturing, growth remains near-stagnant and suggests that the sector is continuing to act as a drag on the economy.\u201d Manufacturing accounts for about 10% of UK economic output, and Dobson said a solid performance by the service sector would be needed to sustain growth in the third quarter of 2015. \u201cScratching beneath the surface of the headline manufacturing numbers shows that the sector is still reliant on the domestic market to drive overall demand, and on the consumer sector in particular,\u201d Dobson said. \u201cThe continued weakness of investment goods demand suggests that \u2018rebalancing\u2019 remains firmly in the rhetoric as opposed to reality column.\u201d The UK purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose from 51.4 points to 51.9 last month, a slightly better performance than the City had been expecting. Any reading above 50 suggests that the sector is expanding. The rate of growth in new orders slowed to its lowest level in 10 months, with a two-tier manufacturing sector characterised by solid demand from UK consumers and fresh declines in overseas business. CIPS/Markit said export order books shrank for the fourth month in succession, noting that the rising value of sterling was making UK goods more expensive in the eurozone, which accounts for almost half the British manufactured goods sold overseas. The stronger pound helped cut manufacturers\u2019 bills for fuel and raw materials, already under downward pressure because of falling commodity prices. However, the survey found that average selling prices rose for the second time in three months, while inflation in the sector was at its highest level for almost a year. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said the PMI survey was welcome, adding there was the prospect that official data for manufacturing due out later this week would show that production picked up in June. But she said poor prospects for exports and energy were holding the sector back. Hopley said: \u201cWhile the headline movement was positive, the story behind the index is a familiar one \u2013 decent domestic demand driven by consumers with strengthening purchasing power, contrasting with persistent challenges in getting exports moving and weak demand for investment goods in the oil and gas sector. \u201cThis is good enough to keep employment prospects growing across manufacturing, but until something gives in export markets or oil and gas investments, the outlook for growth will remain modest.\u201d",

Any reading above 50 suggests that the sector is expanding.</p> <p>The rate of growth in new orders slowed to its lowest level in 10 months, with a two-tier manufacturing sector characterised by solid demand from UK consumers and fresh declines in overseas business.</p> <p>CIPS/Markit said export order books shrank for the fourth month in succession, noting that the rising value of sterling was making UK goods more expensive in the eurozone, which accounts for almost half the British manufactured goods sold overseas.</p> <p>The stronger pound helped cut manufacturers\u2019 bills for fuel and raw materials, already under downward pressure because of falling commodity prices. However, the survey found that average selling prices rose for the second time in three months, while inflation in the sector was at its highest level for almost a year.</p> <p> Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said the PMI survey was welcome, adding there was the prospect that official data for manufacturing due out later this week would show that production picked up in June. But she said poor prospects for exports and energy were holding the sector back.</p> <p>Hopley said: \u201cWhile the headline movement was positive, the story behind the index is a familiar one \u2013 decent domestic demand driven by consumers with strengthening purchasing power, contrasting with persistent challenges in getting exports moving and weak demand for investment goods in the oil and gas sector. </p> <p>\u201cThis is good enough to keep employment prospects growing across manufacturing, but until something gives in export markets or oil and gas investments, the outlook for growth will remain modest.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has sold a further portion of its stake in Lloyds Banking Group amid expectations it could soon start selling shares in Royal Bank of Scotland. The taxpayer stake in Lloyds has now fallen to below 14% from the 43% it stood at when it was bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayer funds following the 2008 financial crisis. Chancellor George Osborne said: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news that we\u2019ve sold more shares in Lloyds bank, taking the total recovered to almost \u00a314bn. I am determined to build on this success, and to continue to return Lloyds to the private sector and reduce our national debt.\u201d He is facing calls from investors in the City to step back from an election promise to hold back shares for a retail offering to shareholders. \u201cI do think it would be an awful lot simpler and less costly to sell the remainder of the shares in the market than execute a retail sale at some fixed discount,\u201d Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, told Reuters. After two placings of shares with institutional investors which began two years ago, the government has been selling shares by \u201cdribbling\u201d them into the market. This new trading plan was launched in December 2014 and will end no later than 31 December 2015. The latest reduction in the stake followed the publication of Lloyds\u2019 results on Friday, which showed the continued impact of the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal. Lloyds has now set aside more than \u00a313bn to pay for claims, and has warned that that figure could rise. Even so, after the stake reduced further, Lloyds said: \u201cThis reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper.\u201d The chancellor is also keen to start reducing the 79% stake in RBS, which received a \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout during the crisis. His advisers are currently deciding whether to recommend a sale, following its half-year results on Thursday. RBS\u2019s shares were among the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, losing 1.4% to 337p amid speculation that a sell-off is imminent. Osborne told the City in June that he wanted to sell RBS even though the shares are trading at less than the 502p average price paid for them. He said profits on selling other bailed-out banks would outweigh the loss on any RBS sale.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greek investors expect a tumultuous day\u2019s trading when Athens\u2019 stock market reopens on Monday after a five-week shutdown. The resumption of trading in Greek stocks will be the latest step back towards economic normality, after the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, struck a deal with the country\u2019s creditors to open talks on an \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) third bailout. But with stringent conditions, including new austerity measures, expected to be attached to any fresh rescue deal, and business confidence shattered by weeks of political chaos, shares are expected to sell off sharply. \u201cThe possibility of seeing even a single share rise in tomorrow\u2019s session is almost zero,\u201d said Takis Zamanis, chief trader at Beta Securities. Other traders predicted shares could fall by up to 20%. The outlook for the Athens bourse was not helped overnight as Asian stocks continued to fall thanks to a deepening selloff in commodities and concerns over slowing growth in China. China\u2019s factory activity shrank more than initially estimated in July, contracting by the most in two years as new orders fell, according to a private survey that dashed hopes that the economy may be steadying. Stock markets across Asia declined with Japan\u2019s Nikkei down nearly 0.5%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng down 1% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi falling 0.9%. Bank stocks, which make up a fifth of the main Athens share index, are expected to be hit particularly hard, after the lengthy bank closures and imposition of capital controls, as the radical Syriza government sought to prevent the country being forced out of the euro. Tsipras and his colleagues are expected to seek a recapitalisation of the banking sector as part of any deal with Greece\u2019s creditors. Talks on a fresh bailout began on Friday, with the reviled \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors now expanded to a quartet, as the EU\u2019s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, joined the International Monetary Fund, the European commission and the European Central Bank. The IMF has repeatedly made clear that it will refuse to provide any new financing for Greece until eurozone governments have made a concrete offer of debt relief; and the Syriza government has instituted economic reforms. The eurozone is providing a \u20ac7bn bridging loan to meet Greece\u2019s financing needs in the coming weeks, including the cost of meeting a \u20ac3.2bn debt repayment due to the ECB on 20 August. But more short-term funding may be needed before the IMF is ready to commit extra funds. Tsipras also faces an uphill struggle to win over fellow members of his Syriza party to the reforms he was forced to pledge in exchange for the prospect of new money. In the wake of the marathon talks with fellow eurozone leaders, Tsipras managed to pass two packages of so-called \u201cprior actions\u201d, in the Athens parliament aimed at reassuring Greece\u2019s creditors \u2013 but only with the support of opposition MPs. Syriza will hold a special party conference next month to consider whether to back Tsipras\u2019s stance, and he has warned that without his party\u2019s support he may be forced to call snap elections. A report in Sunday\u2019s Avgi newspaper, which is close to Tsipras\u2019s government, suggested Athens is seeking about \u20ac10bn to prop up its banks. National Bank of Greece\u2019s US-listed shares have lost about 20% of their value while the Athens exchange has been shut. The ECB\u2019s decision to limit the amount of aid the Greek central bank could offer to the country\u2019s financial sector was blamed by many in Greece for forcing the closure of the banks, and putting strict ceilings on deposits.",
