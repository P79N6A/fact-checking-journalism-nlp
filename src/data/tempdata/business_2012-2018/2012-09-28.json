      "bodyText": "In a week when official statistics showed Britain had ran up a record current account deficit in the spring, the FTSE 100 fell 1.26% on the week, losing 79 points to close on Friday night at 5742. The Office for National Statistics said the \u00a320.8bn deficit \u2013 which includes the UK's trade balance, as well as the shortfall on overseas investments by UK plc \u2013 was the biggest ever for a quarter. And after the market closed, ratings agency Fitch warned Britain had moved a step closer to losing its cherished AAA credit rating. The agency, which already had the UK on \"negative watch\" maintained the AAA rating but warned rising debts and slowing growth jeopardised its status as a safe haven for investors. But on the corporate front the prospect of mergers and acquisitions made a welcome return to the stock market this week. Admittedly, little activity went beyond the talking stage, but investors will take heart at any chance of movement. The news over the past week can be split into two categories \u2013 confirmed talks that may or may not lead to anything substantial, and the most meagre of rumours that are getting punters excited. In the first category is the continuing saga of global commodity trader Glencore and mining group Xstrata. The miner has until 7am on Monday to decide if it wants to accept an improved $32bn (\u00a319.8bn) offer from Glencore. Early indications suggest that the deadline will be extended again. The other mega-merger between British arms manufacturer BAE Systems and Airbus parent EADS was the subject of intense political wrangling as both companies attempt to convince German, French, US and British politicians that the deal is in their interests. Again, a deadline extension is the most likely outcome. The makers of Scotland's favourite fizzy drink, Irn-Bru, AG Barr, continues its talks with rival Britvic for a \u00a31.6bn merger. It has until Tuesday morning to make a decision. Sticking with drinks, the spirits group Diageo confirmed it was in discussions with India's United Spirits. The deal could see the Guinness maker become one of the biggest drinks operators in India. However, both firms are cautious after a similar takeover attempt failed in 2009. The unsubstantiated rumour also had its place, with supermarket J Sainsbury plc said to be in the sights of 26% shareholder and failed bidder the Qatar Investment Authority (also Xstrata's second biggest shareholder). Construction supply group Weir could attract the attentions of GE, following the US group's move to set up a mining subsidiary, while National Grid is supposedly being eyed up by Chinese and American predators. Even Bumi \u2013 Nat Rothschild's mining baby, which announced an investigation into \"financial irregularities\" on Monday \u2013 could be vulnerable, with a handful of hedge funds said to be looking over the numbers. Finally, Standard Chartered may face a takeover challenge if rumours that Singapore's Temasek sells its 18% stake in the Asia-focused bank. Simon Willis at Daniel Stewart speculated: \"Who are the most likely buyers? A Chinese bank or the sovereign wealth fund; or a middle eastern sovereign wealth fund. We believe the former is the more likely, which may reignite bid speculation, though Standard Chartered clearly has no need to sell out, and certainly not on the cheap.\" The hope must be that all the talk can turn to deals or the City's M&amp;A bankers will be forced to twiddle their thumbs a little longer.",

Philip Clarke, under pressure as chief executive, is at the head of the table and is close to losing his voice.</p> <p>Not, as it turns out, from bawling out the group, whose members include internet boss Ken Towle and UK chief operating officer Chris Bush. The previous day the Liverpool supporter was among the angry fans at Anfield lambasting the referee for sending off Jonjo Shelvey, sealing his team's defeat at the hands of Manchester United.

      "bodyText": "It's early Monday morning in a leafy corner of Hertfordshire and a cabal of senior Tesco executives are starting the week with a no-nonsense meeting in the staff canteen at the back of its Bishop's Stortford superstore. They are the top secret \"Baldock group\" \u2013 named after the Tesco Extra near its head office in Cheshunt where they first gathered \u2013 charged with stopping the rot at the UK's biggest retailer, which will report its first fall in profits in nearly 20 years next week. Philip Clarke, under pressure as chief executive, is at the head of the table and is close to losing his voice. Not, as it turns out, from bawling out the group, whose members include internet boss Ken Towle and UK chief operating officer Chris Bush. The previous day the Liverpool supporter was among the angry fans at Anfield lambasting the referee for sending off Jonjo Shelvey, sealing his team's defeat at the hands of Manchester United. But, after Tesco's shock profit warning in January, Clarke has also been banging his fists in the boardroom, prompting the unexpected departure of UK head Richard Brasher in March. On Wednesday he will be the one carrying the can for an expected 10% fall in group first half profits to \u00a31.6bn. UK profits are expected to fall 13% to \u00a31.1bn.

Last year, UK checkouts rang up two-thirds of the group's \u00a33.8bn full year profits, but Clarke said some of the spoils would be sacrificed in the coming year as executives went back on the floor en masse to reinvigorate the chain. At its full-year results in April, Clarke fleshed out a \u00a31bn fightback that would see 430 UK stores given a warmer new look, 8,000 extra staff to improve customer service and a painstaking product by product review of its thousands of own-label foods.

      "bodyText": "The government is under pressure to urgently implement proposals to overhaul the setting of Libor that could result in anyone attempting to rig the key interest rate going to jail. The proposals from Martin Wheatley, a senior official at City regulator the Financial Services Authority, followed the \u00a3290m fine on Barclays for attempting to manipulate the rate, which affects borrowing costs for households and businesses around the world. They came with a warning that other firms faced sanctions for similar offences. Wheatley wants the FSA to be given criminal powers to deal with rigging of Libor rates and to be responsible for authorising managers and their subordinates involved in making submissions used to compile them. While the firms themselves were authorised, the market was not regulated by the FSA, which means it is currently up to the Serious Fraud Office to decide whether individuals can be charged. Wheatley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that in future jail should be a threat for anyone attempting to manipulate the rate. \"Society has lost confidence in banks, in finance, in the whole system, and we need to restore that,\" he said. \"Society wants the people who commit these sorts of crimes to pay the price and if that includes jail for the most extreme fraud in the system, then that's what should happen,\" Wheatley said. Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, called for the 10-point plan drawn up by Wheatley to be \"implemented as soon as possible\", although he conceded that \"further thinking\" was needed for a long-term solution to the market which is used to set borrowing costs on financial products worth $300tn (\u00a3185tn). Wheatley's proposals involve stripping the British Bankers' Association of its role in compiling Libor and replacing it with a new body \u2013 in the next three months \u2013 to be selected after a tender process kickstarted on Friday. Thomson Reuters, also involved, was unable to say whether it would tender. Libor is currently set by a panel of banks asked the price at which they expect to borrow over 15 periods, from overnight to 12 months, in 10 currencies. The rates the banks submit are published on the same day. Wheatley proposes that those 150 benchmark rates are reduced to just 20 \u2013 in five currencies and four maturities. More banks should participate in making submissions, but he is proposing that the individual rates submitted should not be published for three months to avoid a rerun of 2008 when, at the height of the banking crisis, rates were artificially reduced to avoid any stigma of appearing to be in trouble. He acknowledged that there needed to be an international debate about alternative benchmarks; the news agency and data provider Bloomberg was quick to say it was looking at devising alternatives, dubbed Bibor. Wheatley conceded that regulators should have moved more quickly to stop the unscrupulous behaviour in the Libor market, but said the management at banks knew that the culture needed to be changed. \"People don't change their spots overnight\u2026 but nobody wants to work for an organisation that is constantly vilified \u2026 The tone at the top is changing,\" he said. The Treasury appears ready to back the proposals, drawn up after a short consultation.

The Office for National Statistics said its monthly index of services revealed output from the sector growing by 1.1% in July. The jump in activity is expected to offset a further decline in construction output and a manufacturing industry hit by lower levels of exports when figures for third quarter GDP are published on 25 October. A positive GDP figure for the third quarter will put an end to nine months of recession that have undermined confidence in the government's handling of the economy. George Osborne has come under intense pressure to drop austerity measures in favour of a stimulus package to revive growth. The chancellor has argued that the economy will pick up when confidence returns, which can only happen when the government has shown it can successfully implement policies to cut the public sector deficit. The ONS figures show the Treasury has adopted a looser fiscal policy in 2012, which could lead his critics to accuse him of switching to a Plan B by stealth. Government and other services provided one of the biggest boosts to the expansion of services output in July alongside the banking and hospitality sectors. However, just as it was difficult to judge the health of the economy in June after activity levels were hit by a public holiday moving from May into June, it is equally difficult through the summer months taking into account the impact of the Olympics. The Bank of England and most major economic forecasting organisations have said the economy's ups and downs should be discounted in favour of analysis that says the UK has spent the last two years treading water. Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at financial data provider Markit, said strong output from the services sector and industrial production put the UK back on course for growth, albeit at a low level.

Goals, which has 43 sites across the UK, said half year pretax profits were at \u00a31.6m, down from \u00a34m during the same period last year, although revenues were up 11% to \u00a316.3m. The fall in profits was mainly due to \u00a31.3m spent, in part, on the unsuccessful takeover by the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan in July. OTPP offered \u00a373m, or 144p a share, for the company, which the board approved. Senior board members would have been in line for a \u00a39.3m payday. But the deal failed to pass, after not enough shareholders approved. A 75% approval was needed, but only 71% voted in favour. And as if to rub salt into the wound of the shareholders who failed to approve the takeover, the board decided on a rights issue to raise an extra \u00a32.8m \"to provide additional balance sheet flexibility\". Shares were down 6p, 4.9%, at 116p \u2013 a long way off the 144p offered by OTPP. Earlier this month the company did have some good news, winning its HMRC battle over VAT charged on five-a-side football, which Goals was contesting. The win should save them around \u00a3500,000 a year. Analysts Lindsey Kerrigan and Simon French at Panmure Gordon wrote: Shareholders may feel a bit miffed at being asked to subscribe to the proposed placing at 115p per share having rejected a 144p per share bid just weeks ago. We anticipate no change to consensus PBT forecasts, but will need to adjust our EPS figures for the proposed placing. Goals is a solid business with strong management, but needs to go through a period of rehabilitation.",

Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's socialist government in France will become the latest to tighten its belt when it announces \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) of spending cuts and tax increases on Friday. This follows Spain's decision to take around \u20ac40bn out of its budget with the aim of hitting deficit reduction targets agreed with Brussels. Meanwhile, negotiations continue in Athens between Greece and the so-called troika (the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union) over a fresh package of spending cuts and tax increases now estimated at \u20ac13.5bn. All this is happening at a time when the eurozone economy is already going backwards. France announced zero growth in the second quarter \u2013 extending its period of stagnation to nine months. Spain's central bank warned earlier this week that the economy was currently contracting sharply, while Greece is already in the midst of a 1930s-style depression. The austerity programmes come with pledges of economic reforms. Put simply, the idea is that too many eurozone countries have been feather-bedded for too long and now need a chill blast of reality to wake them up. Budget retrenchment will ensure that countries live within their means while deregulation, privatisation and more flexible labour markets will make them leaner and fitter. Before too long a revitalised Europe will be punching above its weight in the global economy. All of which is total moonshine. Not one of the objectives set by Hollande, Mariano Rajoy in Spain or Antonis Samaras in Greece is likely to be met. The first goal is that budget deficits will come down rapidly as a result of austerity. All the evidence so far is that targets will be missed because demand will be sucked out of already pitifully weak economies, with the effects magnified because so many countries are acting in the same way simultaneously. A second fallacy is that the financial markets will be impressed by this self-flagellation. In the short-term that may be the case, but once the rotten economic data \u2013 for growth, unemployment and the public finances \u2013 starts to roll in, investors will take fright at the combination of bombed-out economies and rising debt-to-GDP ratios. Finally, there is the misguided notion that voters will stoically accept all this pain, seeing it as a price worth paying for the restoration of national solvency and to ensure the future of the eurozone. In the fantasy world inhabited by European policymakers, the future is brighter, richer, more harmonious. The general strike in Greece, the demonstrations in Madrid, the pressure for autonomy in Catalonia and the likely negative reaction in France to Hollande's budget, paint a rather different picture. In the real world, the insistence on pain, pain and yet more pain means permanent recession, toppled governments and growing hostility to the European Union.

Northern Europeans with money to invest were willing to lend on extraordinarily easy terms to those in the south who wanted to spend, and ample pre-2007 spending made employers there willing to raise wages rapidly.</p> <p>As a result, southern Europe adopted an economic configuration in which its wage, price, and productivity levels made sense only so long as it spent \u20ac13 for every \u20ac12 that it earned, with northern Europe financing the missing euro. Northern Europe, meanwhile, adopted wage and productivity levels that made sense only as long as it spent less than one euro for every euro that it earned.</p> <p>Now, if, as appears to be the case, Europe does not want its south to spend more than it earns and its north to spend less, wages, prices, and productivity must shift. If we are not to look back in a generation and bemoan \"lost\" decades, southern European productivity levels need to rise relative to the north, and wage and price levels need to fall by roughly 30%, so that the south can pay its way with exports and northern Europe can spend its earnings on those products.</p> <p>If the euro is to be preserved, and if stagnation is to be avoided, five policy measures could be attempted:</p> <p>\u2022 Northern Europe could tolerate higher inflation \u2013 an extra two percentage points for five years would take care of one-third of the total north-south adjustment;</p> <p>\u2022 Northern Europe could expand social democracy by making its welfare states more lavish;</p> <p>\u2022 Southern Europe could shrink its taxes and social services substantially;</p> <p>\u2022 Southern Europe could reconfigure its enterprises to become engines of productivity;</p> <p>\u2022 Southern Europe could enforce deflation.</p> <p>The fifth option is perhaps the least wise, for it implies the lost decades and EU collapse that Europe is trying to avoid. The fourth option would be wonderful; but, if anyone knew how to bring southern Europe's enterprises up to the productivity levels of the north, it would have happened already.</p> <p>So we are left with a combination of the first three options, also known as \"policies to restore European growth\" \u2013 a phrase that appears in every international communique. But the communiques never get more specific. Europe's technocrats understand what adoption of \"policies to restore European growth\" means. So do some of Europe's politicians. But European voters do not, because politicians fear that spelling it out would be a career-limiting move.</p> <p>But if Europe does not adopt some combination of the first three options as policy goals over the next five years, it will face a stark choice: either lost decades for southern Europe (and perhaps northern Europe as well), or continued north-south payment imbalances that will have to be financed through fiscal transfers \u2013 that is, by taxing the north.</p> <p>Northern Europe's politicians should become more explicit about what \"policies to restore European growth\" actually mean. Otherwise, 10 years from now, they will be forced to confess that today's dithering imposed enormous additional tax liabilities on northern Europe. That might turn out to be the ultimate career bummer.</p> <p>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a> 1995\u20132012</p>",

As a result, southern Europe adopted an economic configuration in which its wage, price, and productivity levels made sense only so long as it spent \u20ac13 for every \u20ac12 that it earned, with northern Europe financing the missing euro. Northern Europe, meanwhile, adopted wage and productivity levels that made sense only as long as it spent less than one euro for every euro that it earned. Now, if, as appears to be the case, Europe does not want its south to spend more than it earns and its north to spend less, wages, prices, and productivity must shift. If we are not to look back in a generation and bemoan \"lost\" decades, southern European productivity levels need to rise relative to the north, and wage and price levels need to fall by roughly 30%, so that the south can pay its way with exports and northern Europe can spend its earnings on those products. If the euro is to be preserved, and if stagnation is to be avoided, five policy measures could be attempted: \u2022 Northern Europe could tolerate higher inflation \u2013 an extra two percentage points for five years would take care of one-third of the total north-south adjustment; \u2022 Northern Europe could expand social democracy by making its welfare states more lavish; \u2022 Southern Europe could shrink its taxes and social services substantially; \u2022 Southern Europe could reconfigure its enterprises to become engines of productivity; \u2022 Southern Europe could enforce deflation. The fifth option is perhaps the least wise, for it implies the lost decades and EU collapse that Europe is trying to avoid. The fourth option would be wonderful; but, if anyone knew how to bring southern Europe's enterprises up to the productivity levels of the north, it would have happened already. So we are left with a combination of the first three options, also known as \"policies to restore European growth\" \u2013 a phrase that appears in every international communique. But the communiques never get more specific. Europe's technocrats understand what adoption of \"policies to restore European growth\" means. So do some of Europe's politicians. But European voters do not, because politicians fear that spelling it out would be a career-limiting move. But if Europe does not adopt some combination of the first three options as policy goals over the next five years, it will face a stark choice: either lost decades for southern Europe (and perhaps northern Europe as well), or continued north-south payment imbalances that will have to be financed through fiscal transfers \u2013 that is, by taxing the north. Northern Europe's politicians should become more explicit about what \"policies to restore European growth\" actually mean. Otherwise, 10 years from now, they will be forced to confess that today's dithering imposed enormous additional tax liabilities on northern Europe. That might turn out to be the ultimate career bummer. \u00a9 Project Syndicate 1995\u20132012",

Among the key other recommendations are: \u2022 Managers who oversee the individuals who make submissions to Libor should be approved by the FSA to make it easier to discipline them. \u2022 The British Bankers' Association should be stripped of its role in setting Libor and a tender will be put out on Friday for a successor body to replace the trade organisation that gave banks \"unfettered latitude\" in submitting rates.

The G4S board, though, has concluded that Buckles should not lose his job. \"Whilst the chief executive has ultimate responsibility for the company's performance, the review did not identify significant shortcomings in his performance or serious failings attributable to him in connection with the Olympic contract,\" it said. Keith Vaz MP, who chairs the Home Affairs Committee, welcomed the departures of Taylor-Smith and Horseman-Sewell. \"This is the right decision by senior officials at G4S to take responsibility for the fiasco of G4S's involvement in Olympic security preparations. This however does not represent closure. As the Home Affairs committee recommended, G4S must address outstanding issues concerning the waiving of the management fee and the ex gratia payments it should make to the employees it treated in such a cavalier fashion. \"A strong and clear message to companies that receive taxpayers money has been sent. Those who fail to deliver on contracts must pay the ultimate price. It is now imperative that the government set up the procurement risk register that the committee recommends,\" Vaz said.",
