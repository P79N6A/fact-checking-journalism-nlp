      "bodyText": "Royal Mail staff are pushing ahead with plans for strikes in the run up to Christmas as the battle over privatisation intensifies. The Royal Mail's 150,000 workers were handed \u00a32,200 worth of free shares as part of the privatisation, handing them at least an \u00a3800 instant paper profit on the first day of trading. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), said the 38% rise in value would not make \"one scintilla of difference\" to employees, who are expected to vote for strike action on Wednesday. Staff are prevented from selling their shares for three years. The union is planning a nationwide strike as early as 23 October \u2013 before balloting for further strikes in the run up to Christmas. \"It is likely to be an all-out strike first, then rolling strikes in the run up to Christmas,\" a union source told the Guardian. The union, which represents more than 100,000 postal staff, had wanted to hold the strike \u2013 the first since 2009 \u2013 before the privatisation but the government started the sell-off sooner than expected. More than 95% of Royal Mail staff were opposed to the privatisation in a consultative ballot earlier this year. In an attempt to placate staff, who are officially balloting over pay and conditions, the government granted employees 10% of Royal Mail's shares for free. The shares, which were worth about \u00a32,200 at the government's 330p flotation price, were worth more than \u00a33,000 by the close of the markets on Friday. Thousands of Royal Mail employees are sitting on even greater gains because all staff applications to buy up to \u00a310,000 of extra shares were granted by the government. It means some staff who had \u00a312,200 of shares on Friday morning had almost \u00a317,000 worth on Friday afternoon. Hayes said: \"Shares will make no scintilla of difference to postal workers who are far more concerned about their jobs. We expect our members will vote to protect their terms and conditions in our strike ballot next week. \"It's more important than ever to get protections for job security and terms and conditions under privatisation. CWU won't stand idly by; whoever owns the company will have to deal with us and the workforce.\" The value of the shares is expected to rise even higher on Tuesday, when most of the 690,000 people who bought \u00a3750 worth of shares are officially allowed to start selling their stakes. Bookmaker Paddy Power said the favourite peak share price range on Tuesday was 501p-550p. Michael Fallon, the business minister in charge of the privatisation, attacked the union for pressing ahead with plans for strike action despite an offer of an 8.6% rise over three years. The CWU dismissed the pay offer as a \"misleading and unacceptable\" sweetener designed to win support for the privatisation.",

The necessary restructuring of firms is clear. The necessary degrees and forms of cross-border co-operation are clear. It is a matter of: just do it,\" he said.</p> <p>The Bank of England was in principle prepared to step aside and allow the UK subsidiaries of big US financial groups to be reformed as part of a group-wide resolution led by the US authorities, Tucker said.

I urge US policymakers to avert this potential crisis.\" US administration sources said they had been encouraging the IMF and the G20 group of developed and developing countries to ratchet up the pressure on policymakers on Capital Hill to reach a budget deal. A communique released by the IMF said: \"The US needs to take urgent action to address short-term fiscal uncertainties.\" This echoed word-for-word a communique released by the G20. Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank's president, ruled out the possibility of a default. \"I don't think it's a realistic scenario. I think one can trust that now, as in the past, the political [opponents] will manage to unite on a solution.\" The IMF believes that the impasse in Washington is holding back what would otherwise be a recovery in the global economy. It singled out Britain as one of the areas where progress had been made. \"The recovery in the US has gained ground, stimulus measures have induced a recovery in Japan, the euro area is emerging from recession, and in some other advanced economies including the UK growth is already picking up.\" The IMF told emerging market economies to prepare for likely volatility when the US starts to reduce the amount of stimulus it is providing for the world's biggest economy \u2013 the timetable for which is likely to be put back for several months by the government shutdown. It said that in certain circumstances, countries should seek to manage capital flows but the IMF's managing director, Christine Lagarde, said they should not \"be the first tool that should be relied on\". The IMF meeting came five years after emergency action taken to bail out banks caught up in the financial panic that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, said the most important part of the reform programme prompted by the near-collapse of the financial system was to find a way of resolving the problems of the world's biggest banks without the need for taxpayer support. In his last speech before leaving the Bank at the end of the week, Tucker said: \"It is absolutely essential that the 'too big to fail' problem is cracked. Nothing is more important to the success of the international reform agenda. Without it, global finance would remain fragile; and to protect against that, the international financial system would balkanise as individual countries sought to protect themselves. The stakes are high.\" Tucker said countries would have no excuse if they didn't solve the \"too big to fail\" problem through resolution regimes and reforms. \"The necessary technology is clear. The necessary restructuring of firms is clear. The necessary degrees and forms of cross-border co-operation are clear. It is a matter of: just do it,\" he said. The Bank of England was in principle prepared to step aside and allow the UK subsidiaries of big US financial groups to be reformed as part of a group-wide resolution led by the US authorities, Tucker said. Britain wants the US to offer a reciprocal deal, but has so far not happened.",
