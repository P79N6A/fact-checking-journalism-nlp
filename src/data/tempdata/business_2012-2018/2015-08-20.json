      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading share index dived for an eighth consecutive day on Thursday, as tumbling oil prices and anxiety over a slowing economy in China sent the FTSE 100 officially into correction territory \u2013 a fall of 10% from its recent peak. The blue chip index hit a new seven-month low of 6,367 points, down 0.5% on the previous close and into its longest losing run since 2011. It has lost more than 10% from its record closing high of 7,104 points set in April. The collapse in stock values of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies came after China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai index slumped 3.4% on heavy selling of energy and property companies. Oil prices tumbled, with North Sea Brent down 0.5% to $46.96 a barrel. Bourses lost ground across Europe, while in New York the Dow Jones closed 358 points, or 2.1%, down at 16,990.69 \u2013 its lowest since October 2014. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the London stock market remained vulnerable to further shocks. \u201cThe decline and underperformance of the FTSE 100 has not reflected building concerns about the UK\u2019s economic outlook, but rather the impact of recent events in China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FTSE 100 comprises to a greater extent than most \u2026 commodity producers that are particularly dependent on demand from China.\u201d Analysts said anxiety over the threat to emerging economies of China\u2019s slowdown, and the prospect of higher interest rates in the US \u2013 where many emerging economies have borrowed money \u2013 were sapping investor confidence around the world. Stock markets have now been dropping for several weeks as investors have become increasingly edgy that the world economy was entering a stickier patch. Federal Reserve minutes released on Wednesday showed that the US central bank had concerns over events in China, as well as the strength of the US dollar and the weakness of domestic inflation. The state of the Chinese economy is now centre-stage. The news that the Shanghai stock index had tumbled reignited fears it would repeat a nerve-jangling crash in June when the Beijing authorities were forced to intervene to prevent a rout. The Shanghai Composite Index is down about 7% since China devalued its currency last week, and the wild ride of Chinese shares has raised uncertainty about Beijing\u2019s ability to stabilise the market a second time. Conner Campbell, of spread betting firm SpreadEX, said:\u201cFor such a long time Greece was the market-moving force, be that positive or negative; now, despite a deal being signed, sealed and delivered, something that has happened against pretty formidable odds, investors have been infected with a fear over China that is outweighing any other [non-interest rate-related] news. \u201cAnother tumble by the Shanghai Composite merely reinforced the idea that the Chinese government is struggling to provide a tourniquet for its headline index, and caused the markets to open to more widespread losses after the bell.\u201d In a further sign of the change of mood in China, market researchers Gartner said quarterly smartphone sales in the country had fallen for the first time. The return of low oil prices was widely seen by analysts as a signal of weakness in the world economy. Weak demand from China and much of south-east Asia has pushed down futures prices. Data released on Wednesday had shown that oversupply from fracking wells in the US mid-west and from Opec producers meant the US was holding more oil in its commercial stockpiles. There were also fresh tensions in emerging markets. China\u2019s devaluation has caused other countries to in turn devalue their own currencies, notably Kazakhstan and Vietnam. Kazakhstan\u2019s currency, the tenge, slumped by about 25% after the country announced plans to allow its currency to float freely. The Turkish lira also dropped 1% to a historical low against the dollar. Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said that while falling oil prices indicated weakening global demand and would hit oil- and commodity-producing countries, lower energy costs would eventually boost global growth. He said: \u201cLower oil prices, whatever the cause, may be negative for global growth in the short term if producers [the losers] adjust their spending more quickly than consumers [the winners], and if the falls contribute to uncertainty in financial markets. \u201cBut over time, lower oil prices should still be a net positive for aggregate demand and economic activity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for tonight, unless anything amazing happens in the next couple of hours. Here\u2019s our latest news story, by Jon Henley: Seven months after he was elected on a promise to overturn austerity, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has announced he is stepping down to pave the way for snap elections next month. As the debt-crippled country received the first tranche of a punishing new \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) bailout, Tsipras said on Thursday he felt \u201ca moral obligation to place this deal in front of the people, to allow them to judge ... both what I have achieved, and my mistakes\u201d. The 41-year-old Greek leader is still popular with voters for having at least tried to stand up to the country\u2019s creditors and his leftwing Syriza party is likely to be returned to power in the imminent general election, which government officials told Greek media was most likely to take place on 20 September. The prime minister insisted in an address on public television that he was proud of his time in office and had got \u201ca good deal for the country\u201d, despite bringing it \u201cclose to the edge\u201d. He added he was \u201cshortly going to submit my resignation, and the resignation of my government, to the president\u201d. The prime minister will be replaced for the duration of the short campaign by the president of Greece\u2019s supreme court, Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou \u2013 a vocal bailout opponent \u2013 as head of a caretaker government.... More here: And here\u2019s our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, explains how Tsipras is taking a calculated gamble: After the country\u2019s latest rescue \u2013 and the onerous terms the young prime minister has agreed to \u2013 his popularity ratings will surely have been dented. In a matter of weeks he has lost more than a quarter of his own MPs, radicals who not only feel he has betrayed the cause but will campaign as the only leftists now left to carry the anti-bailout flame. Few politicians have so reneged on their pre-electoral promises as the Syriza leader, who came to power vowing to \u201ccancel\u201d austerity and all the evils it had visited on Greece. And, yet, paradoxically Tsipras remains more popular than any of his political rivals. His handling of negotiations with international creditors has not elicited the widespread condemnation one might have expected. Most Greeks still regard the tortuous talks as a robust defence of their rights. The fact that the terms attached to the \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) rescue were harder than any to date has ultimately been seen as better than euro exit. And unlike any prime minister to date Tsipras has been credited with internationalising the problem of Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt burden. The International Monetary Fund, one of three creditors to Greece and once the country\u2019s harshest economic critic, has become the biggest proponent of debt relief as the basis for recovery..... More drama, this time in New York. The US stock market suffered a late selloff, wiping 2% off the Dow Jones industrial average and the wider S&amp;P 500 index. That follows big losses in China this morning, and Europe today. Analysts believe shares in London will keep falling tomorrow, after entering correction territory today. A late rumour from Greece - Syriza\u2019s left-wingers could be planning to split into their own parliamentary grouping. There are around 40 MPs in the Left Platform, so they would leapfrog Golden Dawn to become the third largest party behind Syriza and New Democracy. That would mean they could get the mandate to form a government (!) before general elections are called (see earlier explanation). Less than a week ago, the eurogroup was celebrating signing off Greece\u2019s third bailout. Tonight, its president Jeroen Dijsselbloem is urging Greece not to abandon its \u201ccommitment\u201d to the currency bloc. In a statement sent to Reuters, Dijsselbloem said: \u201cI recall the broad support in the Greek parliament for the new program and reform package and I hope the elections will lead to even more support in the new Greek parliament.\u201d It really has been quite a year (and there\u2019s still four months to go!) City economists are already warning that Tsipras\u2019s resignation shows it will be very hard to implement Greece\u2019s bailout programme. Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cGiven its anti-austerity roots, the remaining Syriza party will still struggle to implement the demanding bailout conditions, especially in the likely event that Greece sinks further into recession. And major reforms seem unlikely to be passed in the period running up to the election.\u201d Under the Greek constitution, if the PM resigns the mandate to form a government is passed to the largest opposition party, for three days. So Evangelos Meimarakis of New Democracy could spend the weekend trying to form a minority government to replace Tsipras\u2019s administration, as he just pledged. If he fails, the mandate would then transfer to the second-largest opposition party -- currently the extreme right-wing Golden Dawn. Creating a minority government would be rather challenging, as Syriza holds 149 of the 300 seats in the Greek parliament. The head of the largest opposition party, Evangelos Meimarakis of New Democracy, has pledged to \u201cexplore all avenues\u201d to avoid snap elections. That suggests Meimarakis might try to form a government -- meaning elections might not be called tonight after all. Meimarakis also took a few pot-shots at Tsipras\u2019s track record, as the election campaign got underway. Iliana Magra, a politics student in Greece, has tweeted the details: (that\u2019s January\u2019s general election, July\u2019s referendum, and the upcoming snap poll) Moody\u2019s has warned that Tsipras has put Greece\u2019s third bailout programme at risk. The rating agency fears that Greece could miss out on some of the \u20ac86bn loan deal, if it fails to implement the measures agreed with creditors. Or in Moody\u2019s words: \u201cThe Greek Prime Minister Tsipras\u2019s move to step down and call snap early elections on 20 September could elevate programme implementation concerns and, potentially, puts future official sector disbursements at risk.\u201d And here\u2019s Tsipras, asking for elections to be held as soon as possible: Tsipras is meeting with president Pavlopoulis right now - on a rather large sofa: Eurocrisis analysts and journalists are struck by Alexis Tsipras\u2019s split from the left-wing side of his own Syriza party: And that\u2019s it. Alexis Tsipras has fired the starting pistol on a new bout of political drama in Greece, by announcing his resignation after seven dramatic months in office. After one general election, and one referendum, already this year Greeks will head to the ballot boxes again this autumn. If Tsipras has his way, he\u2019ll be re-elected with a new mandate to implement the third bailout agreement. He\u2019s sticking to his position that he did the best he could for Greece, despite failing to deliver his vow to end austerity. The Greek PM also appears to be reinventing himself as a moderate. To do that, he must lose the leftist elements in his party, whose refusal to back the deal forced him to call snap elections. Crucially, Tsipras did not say when new elections will be held. Perhaps that responsibility will fall to president Prokopis Pavlopoulos, who should be receiving Tsipras right now. Greece, the rest of the eurozone, and the world\u2019s financial market faces an anxious few weeks while the election takes place. I am proud of our time in office, says Tsipras, adding that Europe is not the same since Syriza took power in late January. Tsipras is pitching himself in the centre ground between the left-wing elements in his own party who wanted Grexit, and mainstream opposition parties who signed up to previous bailout deals. This TV address is swiftly turning into a party election broadcast, even though the election hasn\u2019t even been called yet. Tsipras says that voters must decide if his government showed \u201ccourage\u201d in its talks with creditors, and whether the bailout deal will allow Greece to recover. I am resigning because I have now exhausted the mandate which the public gave me in January\u2019s general election, says Tsipras. Now you must \u201cdecide with your vote whether we made the right choice\u201d Tsipras confirms that he will step down as prime minister, after almost eight months in office, to trigger elections. I have a moral obligation to place this deal in front of the people, to allow them to judge it, says Tsipras. Tsipsas is running through the good points of his bailout deal (this may not take too long!). He says Greece resisted pressure to cut pensions and to privatise the country\u2019s electricity supplier. Tsipras is arguing that Greece has taken a decisive step forwards in the crisis, though the three-year \u20ac86bn deal he signed up to last month. Alexis Tsipras (jacket, no tie as usual) begins by saying that Greece has been through difficult negotiations, but this phase is finally over. He concedes that he did not secure the bailout agreement he wanted, but it was the best available. We will fight to avoid \u201cadverse consequences\u201d of the bailout programme, he pledges. Nothing on new elections yet..... Please do not adjust your sets..... Alexis Tsipras is starting to give his statement now (live feed here, in Greek). Snap elections will allow Syriza to remove troublesome left-wingers who won\u2019t accept the bailout conditions, but they won\u2019t make the deal much more popular. As Joan Hoey of the Economist Intelligence Unit explains: Tsipras is likely to form the next government having removed dissenting Syriza MPs, but he will not be able to eradicate opposition to bailout policies, which is likely to increase as times goes by. The mind-boggling scope of the reforms in the new agreement, which extend into virtually every area of the economy and polity, exceed anything visited upon even the post-communist states of eastern Europe. The referendum result of 5 July, in which 61% of voters rejected austerity measures demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors, revealed that there is a large body of opinion that is prepared to countenance a break with the euro. In coming months and years, support for remaining within the euro zone \u201cat all costs\u201d will diminish significantly.\u201d No sign of Tsipras yet. ERT\u2019s web feed has crashed, unfortunately. But happily you can also watch Skai News live, here. I believe Alexis Tsipras\u2019s statement will be carried live on the ERT state broadcaster. If so, you can watch it live here. Snap elections could allow Alexis Tsipras to shore up support for the third Greek bailout, tweets EC president Juncker\u2019s chief of staff, Martin Selmayr: The opposite is also true, of course.... Journalists are now gathering to watch Alexis Tsipras take the short trip to see president Prokopis Pavlopoulos and submit his resignation, nearly seven months after taking office. Reminder: Tsipras should address the nation in a TV address at 8pm local time (6pm UK). The European Central Bank has just confirmed that Greece has repaid the \u20ac3.4bn of bonds which matured today (using the new bailout loans handed over this morning). There was never much risk that Greece would miss the repayment, once its bailout was agreed. (It means the ECB is now clear to keep providing support to the Greek banking sector, although I can\u2019t see capital controls being lifted before these snap elections.) My colleague Jon Henley sums up the situation: The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has decided to step down and call snap elections for 20 September, government officials said. As the debt-crippled country received the first tranche of its new \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) bailout, Tsipras was set to make the formal announcement later on Thursday, government sources told Reuters. Once he submits his resignation the prime minister would be replaced by the president of Greece\u2019s supreme court, Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou \u2013 a vocal bailout opponent \u2013 who would oversee the elections as the head of a transitional government. Tsipras won parliamentary backing for the tough bailout programme last week by a comfortable margin despite a large-scale rebellion among members of his ruling leftwing Syriza party, nearly one-third of whose 149 MPs either voted against the deal or abstained. Syriza governs in a coalition with the rightwing, anti-austerity party Independent Greeks (Anel). The revolt by hardliners angry at what they view as a betrayal of the party\u2019s pledge to fight austerity left Tsipras short of the 120 votes he would need \u2013 two-fifths of the 300-seat assembly \u2013 to survive a censure motion and he was widely expected to call a confidence vote this week or next. He has now decided to skip that step, deciding instead to go straight to the country in an attempt to silence rebels and shore up public support for the draconian three-year bailout programme, which entails a radical overhaul of the Greek economy including further tax hikes, spending cuts and major reforms of health, welfare, pensions and taxation.... Here\u2019s Jon\u2019s full story: Greek government bonds are suffering from Tsipras\u2019s decision to trigger the country\u2019s fourth election since early 2012. The yield, or interest rate, on two-year bonds has jumped to 12.1%, from 11.3% last night. A higher yield shows that the debt is seen as riskier. Snap elections will not make it easier for Greece to implement the terms of its new bailout agreement. According to the bailout provisions, Athens has to present by October a supplementary budget for 2015, a draft budget for 2016 and a 2016-19 medium term fiscal strategy, (via Teneo Intelligence;s latest note on Greece). That will include tackling some tough structural reforms, including to pensions and income tax. It\u2019s hard to see how that can happen during an election campaign. And Greece needs to meet these conditions so that creditors can then consider the issue of debt relief. A government official says Alexis Tsipras is planning to hand in his resignation to Greece\u2019s president later today, Reuters reports. There\u2019s also a rumour that the rebellious left-wing of Tsipras\u2019s party are preparing to break away and form their own group. A government official has just confirmed to Reuters that Tsipras will propose holding elections on September 20th. Fasten your seatbelts. Mega TV are reporting that Alexis Tsipas has decided to call fresh elections in Greece in four weeks time, on Sunday 20 September. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s meeting with his top advisors has broken up.... Snap elections, sooner or later, are inevitable due to the deep split within the government, tweets Nick Malkoutzis of the Kathimerini newspaper: Greek media are still confident that Tsipras will address the nation at 8pm local time (6pm BST), so just over two hours to wait..... Having checked with Greek media friends, it appears that Alexis Tsipras would have to formally resign as prime minister if he chooses to trigger snap elections. A caretaker government would then be installed until the polls had been held. And the front-runner to lead that administration, according to Greek Reporter, is the president of the Supreme Court, Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou. More here: The Judge Who Could be Greece\u2019s First Female Prime Minister. Who might win a snap election? Well, Syriza has held a solid lead in the opinion polls all year, even though it hasn\u2019t delivered on the promises made before January\u2019s election. So on paper, Alexis Tsipras has a good chance of being returned as prime minister, perhaps in a new coalition. However, these polls were taken before Greece finally secured its third bailout (the first loan tranche was paid this very morning). The Greek public are still digesting the events of a dramatic year, and coming to terms with the tax rises, spending reforms and economic reforms which Tsipras\u2019s government agreed to. The recent split in Syriza between the rebels of the Left Platform and the rest of the party also complicates the picture. Greece\u2019s sovereign debt is falling in value, as investors face up to the prospect of elections next month. This has pushed the yield on two-year Greek bonds up to 11.6%, from 11.3% last night (a higher yield, or interest rate, means the debt is seen as riskier) So, why is Greece\u2019s prime minister apparently planning to call snap elections, just days after securing the country\u2019s third bailout? It all boils down to political mathematics, and the rebellion that has built up in Alexis Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party over the economic reforms demanded by creditors. Last week, more than 40 hardline Syriza MPs rebelled and refused to back the bailout plan. That deprived Tsipras of his majority (his coalition hold 162 seats out of 300). Having won power in January on an anti-austerity platform, members of Syriza\u2019s Left Platform argue that the bailout measures are unacceptable. Analysts had been expecting Alexis Tsipras to call a confidence vote over the Greek bailout deal But this idea appears to have been shelved, in favour of a straight trip to the polls. Reuters explains: Tsipras - who remains popular in Greece and would be widely expected to return to power if elections were held now - was huddling with senior advisers on Thursday afternoon to decide his next move, a government official said. \u201cEverything is possible,\u201d the official told reporters whenasked whether Tsipras could announce elections later in the day. ERT state television said the timing of snap elections would be announced later on Thursday. And that announcement could come at 8pm Greek time, or 6pm in the UK. Alexis Tsipras gave the snappers a cheerful grin when he left his residence, Maximis Mansion, this afternoon, but didn\u2019t reveal whether he\u2019s planning to send Greece back to the polling stations soon: Speculation about snap elections is continuing to weigh on the Greek stock market. The main Athens exchange has shed 3.2% today, led by financial stocks. Alpha Bank tumbled 14%, followed by Attica Bank (-11%), and Piraeus (-10%), as investors react to this latest instability. State broadcaster ERT is now reporting that Alexis Tsipras will announce a snap election tonight, after consulting his senior advisers. That meeting has just started, according to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Nektaria Stamouli. September 20th appears to be the most likely date for Greece to hold fresh elections: Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 latest take on the situation in Greece: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is due to meet senior advisers shortly to discuss whether to call early elections to quell a rebellion in his leftist Syriza party, a government official said on Thursday. Speculation of snap polls in September has grown in recent days as senior aides including Energy Minister Panos Skourletis openly call for a return to the ballot box. Here we go again? The rumour mill is gathering pace, with reports that Greece\u2019s prime minister will go on television tonight and trigger snap elections. Reuters is now reporting that Alexis Tsipras will meet with senior advisors today to discuss whether to plump for early elections: Wall Street is bracing for losses when trading begins in two hours time: The French and German stock markets have also pushed lower through the morning, and are both down over 1% as traders head for lunch. The latest slide on the Chinese stock market (down 3% today), and fresh tensions in emerging markets (hello Kazakhstan!) overshadowed any relief over Greece. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Markets priced in a short term resolution to Greece\u2019s debt problems in the first few days after the deal was announced. It wasn\u2019t a given that Greece would make its payment to the ECB today but doing so wasn\u2019t enough to offset emerging market concerns. The speculation that Greece could call snap general elections soon is pushing shares lower in Athens: I\u2019m afraid Kazakhstan rarely gets much attention in this liveblog. But no longer! The Kazakhstan currency, the tenge (10 points if you knew that already), has plunged by a jaw-dropping 23% today after the country abandoned efforts to keep its value pegged. The move appears to be triggered by last week\u2019s devaluation of the Chinese yuan by Beijing. China is a major trading partner for Kazakhstan, as is Russia, where the rouble has been hit by falling oil prices and the strengthening dollar. A weaker tenge should make Kazakhstan more competitive, and also more vulnerable to inflation.... Euclid Tsakalotos also told MPs that a fresh Greek general election (if it happens) would not cause panic, due to the stability provided by the new bailout agreement. As covered at 8.30am, prime minister Tsipras appears to be close to calling a snap election. Nothing official yet, though. Back to Greece, where finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has told MPs that the banking sector is on the road to recovery: Enikos has the story: Tsakalotos urged Greeks to trust the banking system and return their money to the banks. He referred to the government\u2019s mistakes but explained that mistakes are always made during hard negotiations. However, Tsakalotos said, there is a legacy and \u201cI think it helped European social democracy to realize that some things need to change in order for the eurozone to be saved.\u201d Confusion over the prospects of a US interest rate rise are also hitting stock markets today. The minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent meeting, published last night, have muddied the waters, helping to send shares down in Asia and Europe. According to IG, the \u2018implied probability\u2019 of a rate hike in September dropped to 38% overnight, from 48% on Wednesday, after Fed policymakers expressed concerns over weak inflation and the threat of a China slowdown. Some analysts think a rate hike next month is now extremely unlikely: But others fear the Fed will soon raise borrowing costs for the first time since the financial crisis began, despite signs of weakness in the global economy: Shane Oliver, head of investment and chief economist at AMP Capital, told clients: \u201cThe Fed appears to be heading toward a rate hike and this against the backdrop of deflationary forces globally is creating intense uncertainty. \u201cInvestors have now grown used to near zero interest rates for more than 6 years in the U.S. and there is naturally fear that raising them will threaten the still fragile U.S. and global economies.\u201d There\u2019s no relief at the Athens stock exchange this morning. The main index has fallen by 2.5% in early trading, with Greek banks leading the rout, despite the news that Greece will receive \u20ac13bn of bailout funds today. City analysts fear that the Footsie could take more of a kicking this autumn, given the speed of its recent declines: Britain\u2019s blue-chip index of leading shares has fallen into correction territory as fears over the global economy hit European stock markets again. The FTSE 100 index hit a new seven-month low of 6359 points this morning, from 6403 last night. That\u2019s more than 10% from its record closing high of 7,104 points set in April, meaning the Footsie is now experiencing a correction (a 20% fall would equal a bear market). Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, tells me: Having dabbled with the level yesterday, there can be no doubting that the FTSE-100 is now squarely in corrective territory, having dropped by more than 10% since the April highs. Stock markets have been dropping for several weeks now, as investors become increasingly edgy that the world economy was entering a stickier patch. The state of the Chinese economy is now centre-stage. And the news that the Shanghai stock market had tumbled more than 3% today has hit European markets. Conner Campbell of SpreadEX explains: For such a long time Greece was the market moving force, be that positive or negative; now, despite a deal being signed, sealed and delivered, something that has happened against pretty formidable odds, investors have been infected with a fear over China that is outweighing any other (non-interest rate related) news. Another tumble by the Shanghai Composite merely reinforced the idea that the Chinese government is struggling to provide a tourniquet for its headline index, and caused the markets to open to more widespread losses after the bell. It\u2019s not a major selloff, but all the European stock markets are in the red right now: With Greece\u2019s bailout now secured, attention has shifted to whether the government will call elections soon or try to hang on. The Kathimerini newspaper reckons that snap polls are now \u201ccertain\u201d, given the rebellion among prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s party over the deal. It says today: Kathimerini understands that one set of advisers is urging the prime minister to move swiftly and call a ballot for September 20 or 27 at the latest so the government can overcome the internal rift that has opened up within SYRIZA. The other group has advised Tsipras not to consider elections before October 11 so the government has a chance to implement its new bailout agreement with lenders, build trust with them and perhaps clear the adjustment program\u2019s first review. \u201cIt is clear there are issues we have to deal with. We do not deny that,\u201d said government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasil. Things are moving fast this morning. Europe\u2019s main bailout vehicle, the ESM, has now approved the first tranche of financial assistance for Greece, totalling \u20ac26bn. It also announced that it will \u201cimmediately disburse\u201d \u20ac13bn to Greece. That leaves \u20ac10bn to help the banking sector, and \u20ac3bn to be doled out this autumn. The money is arriving just in time, as ESM Managing Director Klaus Regling explains: \u201cToday\u2019s ESM disbursement will allow Greece to meet its urgent financial obligations to the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, and other budgetary needs. The second sub-tranche of \u20ac10 billion will contribute to stabilising the banking sector, whose situation deteriorated sharply after the imposition of capital controls in June. Greece has just triggered the procedure to repay the \u20ac3.4bn bond held by the European Central Bank, which matures today. That\u2019s according to the AFP newswire, and Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s been a long, bumpy and nerve-racking journey. And the destination isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s liking. But today, Greece will finally receive an injection of bailout funds for the first time in around a year. Athens should take delivery of \u20ac13bn in fresh loans this morning, as the country\u2019s third, three-year bailout programme gets underway. Another \u20ac10bn will be set aside in Luxembourg to help fund the repair of Greece\u2019s banking sector. As we covered in Wednesday\u2019s liveblog, eurozone authorities signed this off last night, after the Dutch and German parliaments approved the deal. The arrival of the bailout funds will remove the danger that Greece might default to its creditors. Later today, it must repay \u20ac3.2bn to the European Central Bank, to cover a maturing loan. Most of the rest of the bailout cash will also be rapidly spent servicing debts including the \u20ac7bn bridge loan agreed last month, to cover Greece\u2019s other loan repayments to its creditors. Yes, it\u2019s all terribly circular, and doesn\u2019t leave Greece with very much new funding to address its economic plight. But repaying the ECB is another step towards the day when capital controls are lifted. What else is coming up today? China remains a major worry for the financial markets, after recent turbulence. The Shanghai stock market is down another 2% in late trading, despite the government\u2019s efforts to prop up prices. Hang on, it\u2019s now 3%..... And investors are also reassessing the chances of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in September. Last night the Fed released the minutes of its latest meeting, which were more dovish than expected. Policymakers pointed to the dangers posed by the stronger dollar, and a China slowdown, as reasons for caution. With emerging market currencies already at their lowest levels for years, the Fed\u2019s next step will have global ramifications. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

And, yet, paradoxically Tsipras remains more popular than any of his political rivals.

Most Greeks still regard the tortuous talks as a robust defence of their rights. The fact that the terms attached to the \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) rescue were harder than any to date has ultimately been seen as better than euro exit. And unlike any prime minister to date Tsipras has been credited with internationalising the problem of Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt burden.

      "bodyText": "Sell in May and go away, don\u2019t come back until St Leger Day. So goes the old stock market adage and rarely has the first part of that advice been more apposite than this year. The FTSE 100 index peaked on 27 April, just before the general election, and has been on the slide ever since. It is now down more than 10% from its peak, so fulfilling the definition of a correction. On the face of it, there seems to have been no real reason for the slide in the FTSE 100 over the summer. Markets should have been cheered by the return of a majority Conservative government in the May general election. The economy grew by 0.7% in the second quarter and continues to be boosted by ultra-low interest rates. That, too, should be a source of comfort. Cash and gilts don\u2019t obviously represent a better place for investors to put their money. The crisis in Greece has abated, if only temporarily. Yet the selloff has continued. Shares in London have fallen by more than they have on Wall Street and there\u2019s an obvious reason for that: when compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the FTSE 100 has a higher weighting of mining and commodity stocks. And that sector has taken a real caning as a result of weaker demand from emerging markets in general and from China in particular. The jitters in the City have nothing to do with the state of the UK economy and nothing to do with the speculation that Greece might eventually be forced out of the single currency. They have everything to do with concerns that the next global financial crisis has begun in emerging markets. As ever, the riposte to this suggestion is \u201cit\u2019s different this time\u201d, with good reason considered the four most dangerous words in financial markets. Panglossian investors can always think up a hundred reasons why it\u2019s different this time, up to the moment when reality smacks them in the face. The optimists argue that China is adroitly easing its way to slower but more sustainable growth, that the fall in commodity prices has been caused by over-supply rather than a shortage of demand, and that the rest of the world has had plenty of opportunity to prepare itself for an increase in interest rates from the Federal Reserve later this year. The pessimists would say that China\u2019s hard landing is being disguised by dodgy official figures, that oil and metals prices are falling because demand is faltering and that the $1tn of capital that has flowed out of emerging markets in the past year is evidence of a sharp drop in investor confidence. As Russell Jones and Bimal Dharmasena of Llewellyn Consulting note: \u201cThe export-led model has run its course. In many ways, it sowed the seeds of its own destruction, the emphasis on exchange rate competitiveness and foreign exchange reserve accumulation morphing into undue monetary laxity, excessive credit growth, asset price inflation, income inequalities, and malign financial imbalances similar to those built up in the advanced economies pre-2007.\u201d Many emerging market countries assumed that high commodity prices would last for ever. They spent up to their income, and then some. They now have a twin deficit problem: they are running budget and current account deficits. Capital flowed into emerging markets when zero interest rates in the west set off a search for higher yield in markets that were seen as a bit riskier but still safe. Now those markets are seen as not nearly so safe as they were and a lot riskier than the west. There are two silver linings to this cloud. The first is that the renewed drop in oil prices will boost the spending power of consumers and cut business costs. The second is that the Fed looks ever more likely to delay its first rate rise from September to December. In part, that\u2019s because of what\u2019s happening in the financial markets. In part, it\u2019s because the dollar is rising on the foreign exchanges, which has the same effect on the economy as an increase in interest rates, by making exports dearer and imports cheaper. The question investors have to answer is whether this is enough to prevent a stock market correction from turning into a bear market, which is where shares fall by 20%. Should they take heed of the second part of the old saw and come back into the market once the last classic of the flat racing season has been run at Doncaster in the second week of September? Only the brave will consider it. It looks a bigger gamble than a flutter on the St Leger.",

      "body": "<p>Sell in May and go away, don\u2019t come back until St Leger Day. So goes the old stock market adage and rarely has the first part of that advice been more apposite than this year. The FTSE 100 index peaked on 27 April, just before the general election, and has been on the slide ever since. It is now down more than 10% from its peak, so fulfilling the definition of a correction.</p> <p>On the face of it, there seems to have been no real reason for the slide in the FTSE 100 over the summer. Markets should have been cheered by the return of a majority Conservative government in the May general election. The economy grew by 0.7% in the second quarter and continues to be boosted by ultra-low interest rates. That, too, should be a source of comfort. Cash and gilts don\u2019t obviously represent a better place for investors to put their money. The crisis in Greece has abated, if only temporarily. Yet the selloff has continued.</p> <p>Shares in London have fallen by more than they have on Wall Street and there\u2019s an obvious reason for that: when compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the FTSE 100 has a higher weighting of mining and commodity stocks. And that sector has taken a real caning as a result of weaker demand from emerging markets in general and from China in particular. </p> <p>The jitters in the City have nothing to do with the state of the UK economy and nothing to do with the speculation that Greece might eventually be forced out of the single currency. They have everything to do with concerns that the next global financial crisis has begun in emerging markets.</p> <p>As ever, the riposte to this suggestion is \u201cit\u2019s different this time\u201d, with good reason considered the four most dangerous words in financial markets. Panglossian investors can always think up a hundred reasons why it\u2019s different this time, up to the moment when reality smacks them in the face.</p> <p>The optimists argue that China is adroitly easing its way to slower but more sustainable growth, that the fall in commodity prices has been caused by over-supply rather than a shortage of demand, and that the rest of the world has had plenty of opportunity to prepare itself for an increase in interest rates from the Federal Reserve later this year.</p> <p>The pessimists would say that China\u2019s hard landing is being disguised by dodgy official figures, that oil and metals prices are falling because demand is faltering and that the $1tn of capital that has flowed out of emerging markets in the past year is evidence of a sharp drop in investor confidence.</p> <p>As Russell Jones and Bimal Dharmasena of Llewellyn Consulting note: \u201cThe export-led model has run its course. In many ways, it sowed the seeds of its own destruction, the emphasis on exchange rate competitiveness and foreign exchange reserve accumulation morphing into undue monetary laxity, excessive credit growth, asset price inflation, income inequalities, and malign financial imbalances similar to those built up in the advanced economies pre-2007.\u201d</p> <p>Many emerging market countries assumed that high commodity prices would last for ever. They spent up to their income, and then some. They now have a twin deficit problem: they are running budget and current account deficits. Capital flowed into emerging markets when zero interest rates in the west set off a search for higher yield in markets that were seen as a bit riskier but still safe. Now those markets are seen as not nearly so safe as they were and a lot riskier than the west.</p> <p>There are two silver linings to this cloud. The first is that the renewed drop in oil prices will boost the spending power of consumers and cut business costs. The second is that the Fed looks ever more likely to delay its first rate rise from September to December. In part, that\u2019s because of what\u2019s happening in the financial markets. In part, it\u2019s because the dollar is rising on the foreign exchanges, which has the same effect on the economy as an increase in interest rates, by making exports dearer and imports cheaper.</p> <p>The question investors have to answer is whether this is enough to prevent a stock market correction from turning into a bear market, which is where shares fall by 20%. Should they take heed of the second part of the old saw and come back into the market once the last classic of the flat racing season has been run at Doncaster in the second week of September? Only the brave will consider it. It looks a bigger gamble than a flutter on the St Leger. </p>",

As well as providing an online forum and special offers, it organised events and tastings including annual wine fairs, the last of which will be held in September and October.

The introduction of the German chain\u2019s fine wine range last September, which included Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape and Ch\u00e2teau Latour at bargain prices, fuelled a 40% increase in Lidl wine sales over the last year and is regularly expanded with additions from new countries.

    "webTitle": "Linkin Park bets on hybrid theory that they can be tech start-up investors, too", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aging rockers used to buy pubs in rural England or get interested in organic farming. Not Linkin Park. The band behind Hybrid Theory, 27m copies sold since its release in 2000, have their eyes on a tech-filled future. Machine Shop Ventures, their newly formed investment firm, has begun acquiring stakes in companies like ride-sharing service Lyft, Blue Bottle Coffee and the hot shipping startup Shyp. The six guys behind Machine Shop \u2013 Chester Bennington, Rob Bourdon, Brad Deslon, Joe Hahn, Mike Shinoda and Dave Farrell \u2013 can also walk onstage to the roar of crowds, and have sold millions of records and won a few Grammys along the way. But they are taking business seriously too. In May they wrapped up a semester-long study done with Harvard Business School professor Anita Elberse and her students, that looked at the group\u2019s business and brand. The band had formed Machine Shop back in 1999 as an umbrella entity for different projects, then around 2013 they decided it needed to get busy mapping out its future, especially as streaming services had started to fully come in to their own and change the business equations for countless bands like theirs. Fueled by input from Elberse\u2019s students \u2013 who looked not only to the examples of music and business line-straddlers like Jay Z, Trent Reznor and Tyler, The Creator but also to creative brands like Vice and Red Bull \u2013 the band has been on a tear. In addition to backing some of the hottest start-ups they have hired Lisa Kidd, who helped with the business development of Gwen Stefani\u2019s fashion lines, as well as former Beats by Dre executive Michael Seversky. Machine Shop Ventures, executive vice-president Kiel Berry wrote in the Harvard Business Review, will \u201cfocus on investing in early-to-growth-stage consumer-focused companies that align with the band\u2019s ethos of connecting people and innovation through tech and design\u201d. Linkin Park is betting on a future that has shaken the foundation of the industry that made them rich and famous. Taylor Swift may have had the clout to shake up Apple when it threatened not to pay musicians, but in a world where consumers increasingly prefer to subscribe to vast song libraries instead of buying individual tracks, making money in music alone is increasingly difficult. \u201cThe environment today has changed such that Machine Shop is reinventing itself for the current market landscape,\u201d Berry said. \u201cFrom a business standpoint, we do really well with things like touring and merch. In fact, we\u2019re getting ready to do a five-stadium tour in China. All those things are very healthy. The guys also need an infrastructure with which to express themselves in creative ways outside of music. These people are overall creatives with a big C.\u201d Berry\u2019s job, he said, is \u201cto build a sound business behind it\u201d. Berry, Linkin Park\u2019s innovation svengali, joined their Machine Shop company in 2013. He also played a key role in helping launch their venture capital arm this year. Berry is a fast-talking, buzzword-dropping brand captain who gives the impression he\u2019d fit in just as easily at a rip-roaring Silicon Valley startup as he does within the organization of a band. His crew, meanwhile, also has plenty of forward-looking, tech-focused ideas of its own. Linkin Park guitarist, keyboardist and rapper Mike Shinoda, for example, is also the frontman for Fort Minor, Shinoda\u2019s hip hop-centric side project that released a new song, Welcome, recently. To support the song, Shinoda released a music video on the news site Mashable. Other similarly creative diversions for Shinoda have included things like creating stickers for use on the social network Line, which is popular in Japan. Linkin Park teamed up with Line late last year as a way of extending its already robust social presence. Linkin Park and Berry also look to outside examples, like rapper Tyler, The Creator and his creation of clothing and other merchandise elements as well as Pharrell Williams\u2019 entity i Am Other as inspiration for various projects. This line of thinking, plus the analysis done in tandem with Harvard Business School, led the band and Berry to decide on an organizational model built around four verticals \u2013 according to Berry, they are video content, global brand partnerships, merchandise and, the newest, venture capital. \u201cThese are really smart guys,\u201d Elberse said about Linkin Park. \u201cThis band is really pushing boundaries on the music and business side. \u201cThey came to us in the fall, and the band was involved from the get-go. Early on, the band members were discussing what this project could be. There was a lot of benchmarking, and the students did most of the work here, under the direction of Kiel, deriving lessons from the examples.\u201d The band\u2019s takeaways from the Harvard study included things like the need to diversify its revenue streams to mitigate financial risk and to extend its brand. In his HBR essay spelling out the new approach, Berry explained that Linkin Park\u2019s business \u201cnow operates like a tech startup, with less hierarchy and far more agility\u201d. He stresses that the band\u2019s recent moves will exist in tandem with its continued music experiments, releases and performances. But that\u2019s also why music industry analyst Bob Lefsetz, who publishes a widely read email newsletter, sees the band in danger of taking its eye off the ball. He\u2019s not convinced the band ought to be purposefully dialing back the level of attention it used to give to the thing that made it a band in the first place in order to try something new. \u201cWhy can\u2019t everybody stay in their area of expertise?\u201d Lefsetz said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they make good music and see where that leads them?\u201d Berry\u2019s point, though, is the band will indeed keep creating and selling music, playing shows and meeting fans. It\u2019s just that, now, the band is as focused on its art as it is on how to deal with the reality that the music alone is not enough. \u201cMusic always was a hustle,\u201d says Casey Rae, CEO of the nonprofit Future of Music Coalition. \u201cThe terrifying moment about this modern economy is you\u2019ve got so many variables now to keep track of, but the flip side is there are so many more things now under your control. \u201cThere are all kinds of ways now to fund music projects and get stuff off the ground that don\u2019t necessarily have to conform to a traditional way of doing business. It depends on where you are in the industry and at what stage of your career, but the real top line takeaway here is you have to make use of a diverse set of revenue streams across multiple venues and platforms. It\u2019s not any one thing.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Aging rockers used to buy pubs in rural England or get interested in organic farming. Not Linkin Park. The band behind Hybrid Theory, 27m copies sold since its release in 2000, have their eyes on a tech-filled future.</p> <p>Machine Shop Ventures, their newly formed investment firm, has begun acquiring stakes in companies like ride-sharing service Lyft, Blue Bottle Coffee and the hot shipping startup Shyp.</p> <p>The six guys behind Machine Shop \u2013 Chester Bennington, Rob Bourdon, Brad Deslon, Joe Hahn, Mike Shinoda and Dave Farrell \u2013 can also walk onstage to the roar of crowds, and have sold millions of records and won a few Grammys along the way. But they are taking business seriously too.</p> <p>In May they wrapped up a semester-long study done with Harvard Business School professor Anita Elberse and her students, that looked at the group\u2019s business and brand. The band had formed Machine Shop back in 1999 as an umbrella entity for different projects, then around 2013 they decided it needed to get busy mapping out its future, especially as streaming services had started to fully come in to their own and change the business equations for countless bands like theirs.</p> <p>Fueled by input from Elberse\u2019s students \u2013 who looked not only to the examples of music and business line-straddlers like Jay Z, Trent Reznor and Tyler, The Creator but also to creative brands like Vice and Red Bull \u2013 the band has been on a tear. In addition to backing some of the hottest start-ups they have hired Lisa Kidd, who helped with the business development of Gwen Stefani\u2019s fashion lines, as well as former Beats by Dre executive Michael Seversky.</p> <p>Machine Shop Ventures, executive vice-president Kiel Berry <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/06/what-happened-when-linkin-park-asked-harvard-for-help-with-its-business-model\">wrote in the Harvard Business Review</a>, will \u201cfocus on investing in early-to-growth-stage consumer-focused companies that align with the band\u2019s ethos of connecting people and innovation through tech and design\u201d.</p> <p>Linkin Park is betting on a future that has shaken the foundation of the industry that made them rich and famous. Taylor Swift may have had the clout to shake up Apple when it threatened not to pay musicians, but in a world where consumers increasingly prefer to subscribe to vast song libraries instead of buying individual tracks, making money in music alone is increasingly difficult. </p> <p>\u201cThe environment today has changed such that Machine Shop is reinventing itself for the current market landscape,\u201d Berry said.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a business standpoint, we do really well with things like touring and merch. In fact, we\u2019re getting ready to do a five-stadium tour in China. All those things are very healthy. The guys also need an infrastructure with which to express themselves in creative ways outside of music. These people are overall creatives with a big C.\u201d</p> <p>Berry\u2019s job, he said, is \u201cto build a sound business behind it\u201d.</p> <p>Berry, Linkin Park\u2019s innovation svengali, joined their Machine Shop company in 2013. He also played a key role in helping launch their venture capital arm this year. Berry is a fast-talking, buzzword-dropping brand captain who gives the impression he\u2019d fit in just as easily at a rip-roaring Silicon Valley startup as he does within the organization of a band.</p> <p>His crew, meanwhile, also has plenty of forward-looking, tech-focused ideas of its own. Linkin Park guitarist, keyboardist and rapper Mike Shinoda, for example, is also the frontman for Fort Minor, Shinoda\u2019s hip hop-centric side project that released a new song, Welcome, recently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26270b2a76fb17788544f170b757f312ff6b634d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26270b2a76fb17788544f170b757f312ff6b634d/0_166_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"linkin park line\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linkin Park hold signs backstage in July 2007 in Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Junko Kimura/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To support the song, Shinoda <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/06/22/fort-minor-new-song-welcome-video/\">released a music video</a> on the news site Mashable. Other similarly creative diversions for Shinoda have included things like creating stickers for use on the social network Line, which is popular in Japan.</p> <p>Linkin Park teamed up with Line late last year as a way of extending its already robust social presence.</p> <p>Linkin Park and Berry also look to outside examples, like rapper Tyler, The Creator and his creation of clothing and other merchandise elements as well as Pharrell Williams\u2019 entity i Am Other as inspiration for various projects.</p> <p>This line of thinking, plus the analysis done in tandem with Harvard Business School, led the band and Berry to decide on an organizational model built around four verticals \u2013 according to Berry, they are video content, global brand partnerships, merchandise and, the newest, venture capital.</p> <p>\u201cThese are really smart guys,\u201d Elberse said about Linkin Park. \u201cThis band is really pushing boundaries on the music and business side.</p> <p>\u201cThey came to us in the fall, and the band was involved from the get-go. Early on, the band members were discussing what this project could be. There was a lot of benchmarking, and the students did most of the work here, under the direction of Kiel, deriving lessons from the examples.\u201d</p> <p>The band\u2019s takeaways from the Harvard study included things like the need to diversify its revenue streams to mitigate financial risk and to extend its brand. In his HBR essay spelling out the new approach, Berry explained that Linkin Park\u2019s business \u201cnow operates like a tech startup, with less hierarchy and far more agility\u201d.</p> <p>He stresses that the band\u2019s recent moves will exist in tandem with its continued music experiments, releases and performances. But that\u2019s also why music industry analyst Bob Lefsetz, who publishes a widely read email newsletter, sees the band in danger of taking its eye off the ball.</p> <p>He\u2019s not convinced the band ought to be purposefully dialing back the level of attention it used to give to the thing that made it a band in the first place in order to try something new. \u201cWhy can\u2019t everybody stay in their area of expertise?\u201d Lefsetz said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they make good music and see where that leads them?\u201d </p> <p>Berry\u2019s point, though, is the band will indeed keep creating and selling music, playing shows and meeting fans. It\u2019s just that, now, the band is as focused on its art as it is on how to deal with the reality that the music alone is not enough.</p> <p>\u201cMusic always was a hustle,\u201d says Casey Rae, CEO of the nonprofit Future of Music Coalition. \u201cThe terrifying moment about this modern economy is you\u2019ve got so many variables now to keep track of, but the flip side is there are so many more things now under your control.</p> <p>\u201cThere are all kinds of ways now to fund music projects and get stuff off the ground that don\u2019t necessarily have to conform to a traditional way of doing business. It depends on where you are in the industry and at what stage of your career, but the real top line takeaway here is you have to make use of a diverse set of revenue streams across multiple venues and platforms. It\u2019s not any one thing.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank will take take at least two more years to shake off the legacy of its disastrous merger with Britannia and return to profit, its chief executive has warned as he revealed a first-half loss that more than doubled to \u00a3204m. \u201cWe won\u2019t be profitable in 2015 [though] these results are slightly better than we expected,\u201d Niall Booker said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be profitable in 2016 either.\u201d He declined to estimate whether the bank would return to profit in 2017. The bank\u2019s pretax loss for the six months to the end of June widened from \u00a377m a year earlier as revenue fell, charges for bad behaviour rose and it spent more money to make up for lack of investment in its systems. Booker\u2019s prediction means the bank will have posted a loss for four years running after it was left burdened by bad debts from the 2009 deal with the troubled Britannia Building Society. The once mutually owned lender reported a \u00a3257m loss in 2012 and a \u00a31.3bn loss for 2014. The bank\u2019s financial troubles exposed chaotic governance and organisation. Operating income in the first half fell to \u00a3236m from \u00a3307m after it sold assets and suffered losses on some of the disposals. It set aside an extra \u00a310m to compensate customers mis-sold loans and packaged accounts, taking the charge to \u00a349m. Spending on projects to improve systems and processes increased to \u00a3102m from \u00a369m while gains on loans that performed better than expected fell by \u00a342m. Booker said losses this year and next year will be caused by a similar mix of charges and costs, mainly made up of the \u00a3450m allocated to overhaul inadequate systems and processes and to catch up with the industry-wide move into digital services, such as banking via smartphones and tablets. The Co-op bank nearly collapsed in 2013 when it announced a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall and pulled out of trying to buy more than 600 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. It was engulfed in scandal over its former chairman who later admitted possession of class-A drugs. The bank had to be rescued by hedge funds, leaving its former owner, the Co-op group, with just 20%. Regulators last week spared the bank a \u00a3120m fine for failing systems and misleading reporting between 2009 and 2013 because the penalty would have weakened the bank, which is run by new leadership. Booker, who helped clear up the mess at HSBC\u2019s US business during the financial crisis, joined the Co-op bank in May 2013 when it was on the verge of collapse. Campaigners have criticised his pay deal, which could be worth \u00a34.97m this year and \u00a35m in 2016 even as the bank continues to report losses. He said his plan to rebuild the bank was on course and its core business was performing better, while customer departures had slowed after mass defections last year. The bank, whose ethical reputation has been damaged by its recent troubles, lost a net 2,250 current accounts in the first half of 2015 compared with 62,646 a year earlier. Booker said minimising overdraft charges had helped retain customers. As part of Booker\u2019s cost-cutting plan, the bank has closed more than a quarter of its branches in the past year. Branch numbers have fallen to 165 from 227 a year ago, Booker said. He said closures would slow from now on but that more branches would go as customers conducted more of their business on computers and phones. \u201cWe took a fairly big whack at the branches early on. It\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019re seeing elsewhere in the market and it will drive fewer branches and continued investment in digital channels,\u201d Booker said. The expected losses for this year and next year meant the bank was unlikely to launch a mooted initial public offering in the near future, he said. \u201cIt will be a wee bit of time before we are ready to IPO,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must focus on keeping our products simple, continuing to reinforce risk management and systems, strengthening our culture and maintaining our high levels of service. The transformation of the bank remains challenging. \u201cHowever, this should not diminish the progress made against our strategic plan. The actions we are taking are creating a resilient bank that can stand alone, distinguished in the marketplace by its values and ethics.\u201d",

Speaking after an emergency meeting with farming leaders on Monday, Truss claimed that less than half the butter and cheese eaten in Britain was made from British milk. David Handley, chairman of the FFA, said the meeting with Tesco was very positive. The retailer had provided \u201ccategorical assurance\u201d that by March 2016 its own-brand yoghurts would be made with British milk, he said, while further talks would be held on 2 September about the company\u2019s labelling of cheese. Protests against Tesco will be postponed while the talks take place. The FFA is scheduled to hold talks with Asda on Thursday about the amount of lamb it is importing from New Zealand. A Tesco spokesman said: \u201cMembers of our dairy team had a constructive meeting with representatives from the FFA and NFU, as part of our collaborative approach with famers and growers in British agriculture. \u201cWe listened to the concerns they put forward, updated them on our current plans and are committed to build on the progress we have already made to help support the British dairy industry.\u201d European agriculture ministers are due to meet next month to discuss the slide in dairy prices \u2013 caused by a supply glut underpinned by a decline in demand from China and a Russian ban on western milk imports. Truss has said she will push for the creation of a new futures and insurance market in dairy products that could shield farmers from price fluctuations. The environment secretary also plans to set up a working group to discuss how contracts between farmers, dairy processors and supermarkets can be overhauled to share the burden of volatile movements in commodity prices.",

After all, the amount of goods bought on high streets, in shopping centres, in petrol stations and online, was up just 0.1% in July following a drop of a similar size in June. That conclusion looks a bit premature. Spending has certainly eased back from the turn of the year when shoppers were feeling the benefit of last autumn\u2019s crashing oil price. But as Martin Beck of the EY Item Club has noted, there was always a bit of a \u201csugar rush\u201d feel to that spree.

There are a number of reasons for expecting retail spending to hold up, at least for the time being. The first is that real incomes are growing at a reasonable lick: inflation is zero and earnings are going up by 2.4% a year. The second is that the renewed drop in oil prices will generate a second \u201csugar rush\u201d this autumn, albeit a more modest one than that experienced in 2014. Forecourt prices for petrol and diesel have fallen in recent weeks, and that will boost discretionary spending power. The third reason is that other areas of consumer spending that are not included in the retail sales data look strong. This is most obviously true of new car sales, which were at their highest ever level for the first half of the year in 2015. Spending in restaurants and bars has also been going up. It is, of course, possible to envisage the conditions in which shoppers will stop spending. The prospect of higher interest rates from the Bank of England may encourage consumers to save rather than spend any windfall from lower fuel prices. Welfare cuts may depress demand by more than George Osborne has envisaged. But it is not time to hit the panic button yet.",

China\u2019s growth is slowing, with knock-on effects for producers of the commodities that power its manufacturing industry and for makers of goods bought by the country\u2019s new middle class. The authorities have struggled to stop share prices plunging after a bubble fuelled by retail investors. China then stunned markets by devaluing the yuan last week \u2013 a possible distress signal that raised further questions about its policymakers\u2019 ability to keep a grip on the economy. Oil dip The price of oil has more than halved over the past year because of an abundance of supply and dwindling demand, particularly from China. In the short run, cheaper oil has been good for developed economies such as the UK, where consumers have more money to spend after years of falling real wages. But in the longer run if weak demand is a sign that the global economy is slowing then the news is not so good. A partial recovery in the spring had sent oil back above $60 (\u00a340) a barrel but renewed fears of a global slowdown have pushed Brent crude prices down by a third since June, where the price is now around $47. US rate rise? Ultra-low US interest rates have helped fuel booms in assets such as property and shares after investors, searching for a return, shunned cash and put their money into alternatives. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has been hinting for months that the first rate rise in almost a decade is looming. This has prompted jitters in equity markets and huge movements of capital as investors fear a rising cost of lending will affect business borrowing and consumer spending. Most economists expect the Fed to begin increasing borrowing costs slowly in September but that move will depend on employment data and other economic indicators. Emerging problems Emerging markets have profited from sustained investment for most of the decade but sentiment has changed, quickly. Such markets suffered an outflow of almost $1tn of funds in the past year as investors prepared for higher US interest rates by moving into dollar assets and became nervous about the prospects for economies in Asia and Latin America. Once again, China has become the focus because its slowing economy affects confidence in other emerging markets.

      "bodyText": "25 January: Syriza party sweeps to power The anti-austerity far-left Syriza party wins the Greek election by a decisive margin, but is just short of an outright majority. Leader Alexis Tsipras says his party\u2019s victory marks an end to the \u201cvicious cycle of austerity\u201d. The new prime minister appoints as finance minister the radical economist Yanis Varoufakis, who has described austerity programmes as \u201cfiscal waterboarding\u201d. 2 March: Default fears rise as Greece granted four-month extension Greece secures a eurozone bailout extension for four months after Tsipras bows to German-led pressure to stick to the broad terms of the rescue package. But with a heavy schedule of debt repayments due in the months ahead, fears continue to rise that Greece will default unless its international creditors release the \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.1bn) remaining to be tapped from the bailout funds. 11 March: Greece demands war reparations Greece\u2019s strained relations with Germany take a turn for the worse as the new government in Athens raises the spectre of seizing German assets for war reparations. Tspiras says Berlin has a moral obligation to make amends for years of Nazi occupation. Germany responds by saying it honoured its war obligations and would not be revisiting the controversy. Tspiras returns to the subject later in March during a joint press conference with German chancellor Angela Merkel. 12 March: Germany-Greece row heats up German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble describes as \u201cnonsense\u201d accusations that he insulted Greek counterpart Varoufakis with comments that he was \u201cfoolishly naive\u201d. 6 April: Greece steps up US charm offensive Varoufakis continues efforts to drum up US support for his debt-stricken country, holding talks with senior administration officials after meeting International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Christine Lagarde. 8 April: Tsipras meets Putin in Moscow Tsipras has talks with Russian presidentVladimir Putin in Moscow. Athens insists it will not seek financial aid from the Kremlin but analysts say Greece is playing both Russia and the EU. During his visit, Tsipras calls on Europe to end its sanctions against Russia, warning that they could lead to a new cold war. 27 April: Varoufakis shuffled out Greece moves to inject fresh momentum into talks with creditors, reshuffling its negotiating team to try and defuse tensions over its outspoken finance minister. Athens insists Varoufakis would continue to supervise talks but says the minister of international financial relations, Oxford-educated Euclid Tsakalotos, would take over the coordination of the new team. Varoufakis denies he has been sidelined from talks. 6 May: Greek debt default avoided Greece gains some breathing space in its battle to stay solvent as it meets the deadline for a \u20ac200m debt payment to the IMF and the European Central Bank extends its lifeline to the country\u2019s banking system. Greece makes another IMF loan repayment a few days later, but it emerges that it met the \u20ac750m with money held at the IMF itself. 24 May: Greece warns of new default risk Greece threatens to default on \u20ac1.6bn of debt repayment due on international bailout loans in June, claiming it does not have the funds to satisfy creditors at the same time as paying wages and pensions. 28 May: IMF head warns: Grexit a possibility Lagarde says a Greek exit from the eurozone is a possibility as the indebted country strives to meet a 5 June deadline for a \u20ac305m payment to the IMF. 4 June: Greece delays IMF repayment Greece moves closer to default after telling the IMF it will not be making a debt repayment of \u20ac300m due the next day. Athens surprises the IMF by saying it intends to bundle up four payments in June totalling \u20ac1.6bn and make them all at the end of the month. 7 June: Juncker accuses Tsipras of lying over bailout talks European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker makes a blistering attack on Tsipras, accusing him of undermining negotiations over new terms for a bailout and of effectively lying to the Greek parliament. 9 June: Greece submits new reforms package Tsipras warns that the failure to agree a rescue deal would spell the end of the eurozone, as he submits a revised package of reforms to negotiators in Brussels. But EU officials do little to hide their frustration at what they see as Greece\u2019s lack of compromise. 11 June: IMF walks out of talks The IMF walks out of bailout talks, accusing Athens of failing to compromise over labour market and pension reforms. The move by the Washington-based lender of last resort\u2019s team of negotiators follows increasingly sharp criticism from EU officials frustrated at the Greek government\u2019s continued refusal to bow to creditors\u2019 demands. 17 June: UK steps up contingency plans The UK starts planning for \u201cserious economic risks\u201d arising from Greek exit from the euro. 18 June: Eurozone talks break down Greece faces a full-blown banking crisis after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers breaks down in acrimony and recrimination. Fears of more money flooding out of Greek banks intensify as it emerges that about \u20ac2bn of deposits have been withdrawn for the week so far. 22 June: Emergency summit boosts deal hopes The Athens stock market surges 9% as an emergency EU summit ends with high hopes of reaching a deal within 48 hours. The country\u2019s European partners welcome proposals from Athens to cut its pension bill and raise extra money from VAT. The new Greek proposals leak, revealing cuts of \u20ac8bn. 25 June: Talks fail again In the fourth diplomatic failure in eight days, talks on the Greek debt crisis between eurozone finance ministers grind to a halt after Athens rejects counter-proposals from its creditors. With a \u20ac1.6bn payment due to the IMF within days, more talks are scheduled. 26 June: Tsipras calls referendum Greece rejects a proposed five-month extension of the second bailout and after an emergency meeting of his cabinet, Tsipras says the government has decided that a package of austerity measures proposed by creditors will be put to a popular vote. The referendum will take place on 5 July. 28 June: Tsipras announces capital controls and bank holiday The Greek government confirms capital controls are being imposed. Greeks will be restricted to taking out just \u20ac60 a day for the next week, and banks will not reopen until 7 July \u2013 two days after the referendum. 30 June: Greece defaults. Bailout expires Greece becomes the first country in the EU to default on its creditors as it fails to make a \u20ac1.5bn payment to the IMF on time. On the same day its second international bailout package expires, appearing to leave the country without a financial lifeline. 2 July: IMF says Greece needs extra \u20ac60bn in funds and debt relief The IMF electrifies the referendum debate in Greece after it concedes that the country needs up to \u20ac60bn of extra funds over the next three years and large-scale debt relief. 5 July: \u2018No\u2019 vote against austerity measures Greece\u2019s referendum delivers a resounding no to its creditors, in a move that stuns the eurozone. The no campaign exceeds all expectations by securing 61.31% of the vote, despite eurozone leaders having lined up ahead of the poll to tell Greeks it was really a choice between the euro and the drachma. 6 July: Surprise resignation of Varoufakis Varoufakis quits, despite the country\u2019s decisive rejection of the eurozone\u2019s terms for Greece remaining in the single currency. Announcing his resignation in a blog post entitled Minister No More!, Varoufakis said Tsipras thought it would be better if he stood down, after pressure from European leaders. 8 July: Eurozone leaders set new Greek deadline European leaders set a new deadline of 12 July by which Tsipras, has to capitulate to their menu of cuts, tax rises and fundamental reforms of the Greek economy in return for bailout money. Otherwise, EU leaders say, Greece will be cut off from the eurozone. 9 July: Greece capitulates The Greek government capitulates to demands from its creditors for severe austerity measures in return for a modest debt writeoff, raising hopes that a rescue deal could be signed at an upcoming emergency weekend meeting of EU leaders. 12 July: Germany and France press Greece for austerity guarantees At an emergency summit in Brussels, European leaders confront the Greek government with a draconian package of austerity measures entailing a surrender of fiscal sovereignty as the price of avoiding financial collapse and being ejected from the single currency. 17 July: Tsipras reshuffles cabinet to clear out bailout dissidents Tsipras seeks to rid his government of hardline leftists who oppose further austerity by reshuffling his cabinet. Following a vote in favour of starting talks about a third Greek bailout in the German parliament, the EU agrees to a \u20ac7bn, three-month bridging loan. 20 July: Banks reopen in Greece Greece takes a step back to normality as its banks reopen following three weeks of closures and it receives a \u20ac7.2bn loan, spending almost all of it immediately on repaying debts. 23 July: Vote clears way for bailout talks Greece is ready to begin formal talks on a proposed \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn) bailout after MPs voted for reforms demanded by its creditors in a vote overnight. While 230 MPs backed a package of reforms, 63 voted against. Tsipras managed to contain the rebellion in his own ranks. 26 July: Greece rocked by reports of secret bank raid plan Reports emerge suggesting some members of Greece\u2019s government wanted to raid central bank reserves and hack taxpayer accounts to prepare a return to the drachma. It is not clear how seriously the government considered the plans, attributed to former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and Varoufakis. The former finance minister later defends his contingency plans, saying it would have been remiss of him not to have a plan B if negotiations with the country\u2019s creditors had collapsed. 30 July: IMF says no bailout role without Greek debt relief The IMF says it will refuse to participate in a new bailout for Greece until there is an \u201cexplicit and concrete agreement\u201d on debt relief from the country\u2019s eurozone creditors. 11 August: Bailout hopes rise Greece\u2019s stock market rallies on news that the indebted country and its creditors have reached an outline agreement over an \u20ac86bn bailout. 14 August: Greece secures third bailout Two hundred days after sweeping to power, Greece\u2019s Syriza-led government clinches the three-year bailout after parliamentarians in Athens back the deal, and Berlin relents on its opposition to the third rescue of the bankrupt country in five years. 19 August: German MPs vote yes to bailout In a parliamentary session, German MPs vote 454 in favour, 113 against with 18 abstentions. 20 August: New funds reach Athens in time for ECB debt deadline The first chunk of rescue funds under the new bailout deal is released to Athens just in time for the Greek government to meet a debt payment of \u20ac3.2bn due to the European Central Bank.

The inability of the government to use its budget to pay for anything more than basic pensions, public sector salaries, welfare and the interest on its massive pile of debts is another reason to be doubtful.",

The image of a frail, white-haired Greek pensioner lying in front of a cash machine, which apparently had failed to disgorge his miserable ECB-specified stipend of \u20ac60, has gone around the world symbolising for many the moral emptiness at the European project\u2019s core. The economics which were meant to heal a war-stricken continent have instead set countries at each other\u2019s throats. Economics is where politics and reality collide. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the case of the Greek crisis. Politically, the Greek government had a mandate reinforced by its referendum to put an end to austerity. Likewise, from the other side, the EU governments did agree on one thing the eurozone would not allow any bailouts. No ifs, no buts, no maybes. And yet here we are with the Greeks tucking into their third load of bailout money and signing up at the same time to another dose of increasingly powerful \u201causterity medicine\u201d. It\u2019s confusing yet also impressive. The EU has grown up and passed its first big existential test. No one got what they wanted \u2013 certainly not the Greeks \u2013 but the show must go on. And assuming it does, it will be because, deep down, the EU exists precisely to harness this unflappable umpire characteristic of economics. Or, to put it another way, to turn bitter ethical and political disputes into simple bean-counting exercises. How often did we hear that the eurozone finance ministers were waiting to be told what to think by their experts? Well, maybe not often enough. But that\u2019s the reality of the EU, and one of its strengths. Strategies are drawn up by technocrats and politicians are only allowed to delay implementing them. However, there\u2019s always a problem handicapping the dismal science. Economists do not agree on anything. And so politics re-enters by the back door and arguments break out all over again. The IMF calls for a write-down of Greek debt, yet hawks point out that the terms have been made so generous that in 2014, for example, the effective interest rate on its debt was actually slightly lower than that paid by Germany. Other siren voices blame Greece\u2019s woes on the rigidity of the euro, saying that if only Greece was brave enough to break free of its shackles, it could sell its (EU-subsidised) olives, and maybe its strawberries too, more vigorously. Goods such as strawberries \u2013 and rice \u2013 are what Greece exports; warships, luxury cars and, well, money, are what it imports. For the Greek farmers, the \u20ac2.5bn they receive from the EU is almost half (40%) of their income and so much of their profits that it would be more efficient to pay them to retire after all, and nuts to whatever the Nordic countries think. And within Greece it would seem to be more just too, which is really what the crisis is all about. Why should it be just the nomenklatura \u2013 the lawyers, lecturers, civil servants and, of course, politicians who get the big cars, the island retreats and the early retirement deals? In the public sector, 33% of employees retire before 55 and another 44% between 56 and 61. Austerity has meant a rush of people hurrying to retire on the generous package supposed to be phased out in future. If Alexis Tsipras did not actually say \u201cGentlemen, unfortunately, we are bankrupt again\u201d on his arrival in Brussels a few months ago \u2013 maybe he should have done. Instead, it was another Greek prime minister, Charilaos Trikoupis, who uttered those immortal words, way back in 1893 as his economy ground to a halt in a very similar way. The International Financial Control that followed led to sales taxes from the state monopolies of salt, oil, cigarettes and so on going directly to the lenders, an indignity that lasted until 1978. Yet it allowed the Greek economy to keep going.

      "bodyText": "The Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 latest breakdown of Australia\u2019s population shows that the stereotypes hold true. Baby boomers still dominate the coastal seachange towns; the inner city is still flooded with young singles. In the mining areas of Western Australia we find the greatest number of men compared to women; and (perhaps counterintuitively) the ACT provides the suburb with the greatest number of women compared to men. The figures for 2014 of Australia\u2019s population show that of the 23.49 million of us, half are under the age of 37 years and three months, 50.3% are female, and 66.5% live in capital city areas. Within those averages are a great many differences. Even at the state level things are quite different. South Australians and Tasmanians, for example, are on average much older than their fellow Australians: 36.3% of South Australians and 38.7% of Tasmanians are over 50 years of age, compared to 32.8% of the nation: Queensland is the youngest state, with just 31.9% of its residents above 50 years of age, but the two territories are the truly young populations. Respectively, just 22.6% and 28.6% of those living in Northern Territory and the ACT are over 50 years old. How old you are does appear to have bearing on where you live. 73% percent of those aged between 25 and 29, for example, live in the capital cities, compared to 60% of those aged 70 to 79: This tendency for retirees to leave the capital cities and find peace on the coast is certainly reflected by the data. The areas which have the highest concentration of people over the age of 70 are places like Tuncurry on the NSW mid-north coast, which has the highest concentration of people over 70 with 30.2% - well above the national average of 9.9%. Similarly Hawk\u2019s Nest, just an hour or so south of Tuncurry, has 28.6% of its population over 70, while Victor Harbor in South Australia lives up to its title in that state as \u201cGod\u2019s waiting room\u201d with 26.9% of its residents past their seventh decade. The breakdown of Victor Harbor\u2019s population gives a good snapshot of such locales: Victor Harbor has fewer people of every age bracket younger than 50-54 years than anywhere else. Once over that age, it become more concentrated than the rest of Australia. Similarly, while the ABS notes that \u201cthe majority (63%) of baby boomers lived in Australia\u2019s capital cities in 2014\u201d they too will be found in greater concentration \u201clocated around larger urban centres in regional Australia or along the coast\u201d. The areas featuring the highest concentration of baby boomers (which the ABS defines as those born between 1946 and 1966) is the Benalla Region in between Shepparton and Wangaratta. In 2014, 39.5% of its population were boomers \u2013 well above the 22.9% national average. Other areas highly populated with boomers includes the Bega-Eden hinterland with 38.8% concentration; Castlemaine, just south of Bendigo in regional Victoria, with 38.5%; and Magnetic Island just off of Townsville in Queensland, of whom 37.8% of its 2,412 residents are baby boomers. Castlemaine is fairly typical of such areas: not as low concentration of children as in the retirees areas, but a drop off in the concentration of those in the early 20s to 30s, and a huge \u201cboom\u201d in numbers of those ages 50 to 70: For the areas with the higher numbers of non-boomers we need to split them up into two groups. The first are those with the high concentration of young families, often found in the suburbs. Places like Wakerly in Brisbane\u2019s suburbs, Parklea in Sydney\u2019s outer suburbs and Forde in the ACT north have both high concentration of Generation X residents \u2013 those aged in the mid 30s to late 40s \u2013 and also a high concentration of children under 14. Forde, a new suburb in the ACT founded around five years ago, has the highest concentration of young and Gen Xers in the nation: 60% of residents are either under 14 or between 35 and 49 years of age, compared to the national average of 39.1%: But the Gen X\u2019s younger cohort, Gen Y (which the ABS counts as including those born up to 1986) and that even younger group generally referred to as the \u201cmillennial\u201d, are not to be found in high concentration in the outer suburbs, but in the inner city. You can also find them living and working in mining areas like East Pilbara in Western Australia, and Ashburton. But Fortitude Valley in inner Brisbane, Darlinghurst and Surry Hills in Sydney and St Kilda and Southbank in Melbourne are much more representative of the types of places where high amounts of young singles or couples without kids live. In Surry Hills, for example, 47% of residents are aged 20 to 34 compared to just 21.8% for the entire nation. Kids are almost absent. Only 5.3% of Surry Hills residents are under 14, compared to 18.8% nationwide: Finally, the data also shows us where there are highest imbalances of men and women. Obviously, men aged 20 to 65 are in the mining areas. In East Pilbara, for example, there are 413 men for every 100 women \u2013 compared to the national average of 99.6 men per 100 women: One of the few areas with a high concentration of men not associated with mining is Campbell in the ACT, home to the Australian Defence Force Academy and Royal Military College Duntroon. Again, not a surprise. The ACT is also home to the area with the highest concentration of women: the suburbs of Hackett, Cook and Stirling. In Hackett, there are just 75 men for every 100 women: There appears to be a correlation between such high ratios of women to men with higher-than-average numbers of single parent families. In 82% of such families, the parent is a woman. But while, for example, in the area of Manoora in Cairns 39.3% of households are single parents compared to the national average of 15.9%, only 13.6% of Hackett households are single parent ones. The stereotypes about the places we live are sometimes borne out by the numbers. Whether they are or not, the data always tells an interesting story about the people in your neighbourhood.",
