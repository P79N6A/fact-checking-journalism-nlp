As the Labour leadership accused the coalition of launching a smear campaign over the party's links with the disgraced chairman, a transcript of an interview with Balls in 2010 showed that he highlighted his role in helped to create Britain's \"first ever 'super-mutual'\". Balls told the Co-operative party in August 2010: \"I was able to show this [my support for co-operatives] by ensuring treasury support for a new private members bill [introduced by the then Tory MP Sir John Butterfill] that led to the creation of the first ever 'super-mutual', bringing Britannia Building Society and the Co-op Bank together in the interests of customers, rather than the banking elite.\" A spokesman for Balls acknowledged that he supported the private member's bill but pointed out that he played no role in approving the merger in 2009 which was made on commercial grounds when he was schools secretary. Balls said Flowers had been suspended from Labour and was \"out, out, out\". Flowers resigned from the unpaid position as a trustee at the Lifeline Project in Manchester in 2004 after its chief executive Ian Wardle blew the whistle to the charity's solicitor regarding discrepancies in Flowers's expenses. Wardle said: \"These discrepancies had not been obvious and required a detailed investigation. Following legal advice from the outset from Lifeline's solicitor and further support from Queen's Counsel, the investigation continued and a process was followed to attempt to identify with the involvement of Rev Flowers, which of the expenses were reasonably incurred and which were not. The matter was fully reported to the Charity Commission.\" Wardle said the charity had no record of the Co-op ever asking for a reference concerning Flowers. The Charity Commission said Lifeline Projects had never provided any evidence that Flowers had acted in bad faith in claiming the expenses, or that he had claimed expenses incurred outside of charity business. The commission believes that Flowers claimed under an expenses policy agreed by the Lifeline's board, which turned out to be \"not in line with charity or company law and not allowed by the terms of the charity's governing document.\" New management at Lifeline changed the expenses policy to make it legally compliant and asked Flowers to pay the money back. According to the charity, he never did. The Charity Commission said: \"We are now writing to the charity of which the former trustee of Lifeline Projects is still a trustee to reassure ourselves that it is satisfied its governance systems are robust and there are no concerns relating to the issues raised by Lifeline Projects. \"We will also write to all of the charities of which the trustee in question has served as a trustee for the same purpose.\" Flowers has stood down from the boards of the Manchester Camerata and the Terrence Higgins Trust. The trust said on Thursday that Flowers had not claimed expenses, sent emails from the trustee email address nor accessed the internet.",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons will send out its first online grocery deliveries to customers in Warwickshire on 10 January and will be delivering in London by next summer, as the Bradford-based grocer attempts to regain sales lost to its rivals' internet grocery services. Dalton Philips, chief executive, outlined a service that will include a virtual butcher and a grading system for fresh food, will allow shoppers to immediately hand back food they don't think is good enough. Philips said he would be delivering the first order in one of Morrisons' bright yellow vans as he seeks to turn around the chain's fortunes by selling more fresh food online than any other grocer. The supermarket has been losing market share under pressure from discounters such as Aldi and major supermarkets such as Sainsbury's. In September it revealed a 22% fall in half-year profits. Philips is hoping an array of specialist services can draw in shoppers who will spend more online with Morrisons than they do with other grocers and keep them loyal. Those services include expert quality ratings on all produce, special packaging to prevent damage to fragile items such as bananas and the ability to return and receive money-off vouchers for fresh goods found not be up to standard on the doorstep. It will also offer steaks in a variety of thicknesses and bread and cakes baked fresh in Morrisons stores. The retailer is hoping these ideas will help it become profitable online, unlike other grocers, by boosting sales of fruit, vegetables, meat and fish \u2013 which make more money than general groceries. Philips said: \"Our competitors have been online for some time and we are quite late to the party but I'm confident we can make quite an entrance.\" He said Morrisons was combining its expertise in fresh food with the technological and distribution prowess of Ocado, the online grocery specialist which will provide the IT and delivery infrastructure behind Morrisons' online service as part of a \u00a3216m 25-year deal signed earlier this year. \"When you combine the two the economics work,\" Philips insisted. Morrisons shoppers will be able to use an array of services currently enjoyed only by more up-market shoppers using the Ocado branded service. For example, they can easily switch shopping lists from rival grocers' services. They can choose one-hour delivery slots costing from \u00a31 to \u00a35, similar to rival services. \"We have got the best online shopping service in the market,\" boasted Neil Austin, supply chain and logistics director. Morrisons must certainly make a splash if it is to persuade the 32% of Morrisons shoppers who already shop online to switch from rivals. The supermarket also faces a challenge to make profits online, given the potential costs of some of its special services, while online orders could eat up sales from the supermarket's high street stores making them less profitable. The voucher system seems open to potential costly abuse, while Morrisons is demanding a minimum online spend of \u00a340, well ahead of Sainsbury's and Asda which both ask for a minimum of \u00a325 while Tesco has no minimum. Filling that \u00a340 basket may also be tough initially as Morrisons will only be offering about 12,000 different products online, about 8,000 less than its rivals currently have available to internet shoppers. \"At least initially there may be a risk that some customers are disappointed at their inability to purchase certain specific items,\" said James Anstead, an analyst at Barclays, in a note. Morrisons also faces a challenge in taking the service nationwide at a hectic pace. The plan is to start trials with staff early in the new year and begin deliveries in Warwickshire about a week later. Morrisons' homeland of West Yorkshire will follow in February, with London and south Yorkshire by the middle of 2014. The company said it would be adding capacity to deliver to 1m more households every month in 2014 as it drives towards serving 50% of the country's homes by the end of next year.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's manufacturers are ramping up production at the fastest pace for 18 years as new orders pour in, a key survey showed on Thursday, rekindling hopes for a rebalancing of the economy. The Confederation of British Industry's monthly snapshot of the sector showed growth in output, and orders, both at their highest level since 1995. The CBI said that 36% of almost 350 firms polled reported their order books were fuller than normal in November, with 25% saying they were emptier. The resulting balance of +11% was the strongest since March 1995. Similarly, the positive balance for firms reporting rising output, at +29%, was the strongest since January 1995. Stephen Gifford, the CBI's director of economics, said: \"This new evidence shows encouraging signs of a broadening and deepening recovery in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturers finally seem to be feeling the benefit of growing confidence and spending within the UK and globally.\" The coalition will be encouraged at signs of a revival in British industry, after fears that the economic recovery has so far been too reliant on consumer spending and the housing market. The chancellor, George Osborne, has said he wants a \"march of the makers\", helping to double exports by the end of the decade, so that Britain can \"pay its way in the world\". Business surveys have been pointing to a revival in manufacturing for some time, but it has only recently begun to be reflected in official figures, which showed a 0.9% increase in output from the sector in the third quarter of 2013, driven primarily by the success of carmakers. The latest data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), also published on Thursday, showed that 160,854 cars were made in Britain in October \u2013 up 17.4% on the same month last year. Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive, said: \"UK car manufacturing for the home market increased strongly in October. With European demand showing early signs of recovery, we expect production to continue positively in the coming months.\" However, output from the manufacturing sector as a whole remains more than 8% below its peak before the financial crisis. Indications of the upbeat mood among manufacturers in the UK contrasts with more pessimistic surveys from the eurozone, where this month's first estimates of sentiment among purchasing managers \u2013 so-called \"flash PMIs\" \u2013 suggest that the economic recovery is petering out in several countries, including France. While the composite PMI for the eurozone remains above the 50 mark at 51.5, this is a decline from October's level of 51.9, suggesting that while the eurozone economy as a whole has not yet slid back into recession, the pace of growth appears to have slowed. Chris Williamson, of data provider Markit, which compiles the survey, said: \"The fall in the PMI for a second successive month suggests that the European Central Bank was correct to cut interest rates to a record low at its last meeting, and the further loss of growth momentum will raise calls for policy makers to do more.\"",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has little scope for giveaways as he puts the finishing touches to his autumn statement, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned, despite news that the economic recovery has boosted the Treasury's coffers. The chancellor is expected to announce stronger-than-expected growth forecasts and a moderate improvement in the public finances when he presents his autumn statement on 5 December. The latest data on tax and spending, published on Thursday, showed that buoyant revenues from stamp duty and VAT, have allowed the Treasury to borrow almost \u00a36bn less between April and October than during the same period last year. However, the tax thinktank said the chancellor would have to explain in his autumn statement how he will find around \u00a32bn to fund pledges made during the party conference season, including free school meals for the youngest primary school pupils and a married couple's tax allowance. Given the Treasury's new target to eliminate the deficit on the public finances by the end of the next parliament, the IFS said: \"Considerable further austerity (requiring either a further two-year freeze in total public spending or a further net tax rise) would still be needed to meet Mr Osborne's proposed new deficit target. So perhaps any talk of pre-election giveaways should wait.\" That would disappoint those of Osborne's colleagues who have been calling on him to tempt voters with pre-election tax cuts. The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing in October, excluding temporary factors such as the transfer of the Royal Mail pension fund, was \u00a38.1bn, down from \u00a38.2bn in the same month last year. Just over halfway through the 2013-14 fiscal year, which started in April, net borrowing measured on the same basis was running at \u00a364.8bn, compared with \u00a370.6bn in the same period a year ago. Tax receipts in October were \u00a31.5bn, or 3.2% higher than the same month last year, driven by a 6.4% rise in the VAT take, and a bumper 45.9% rise in stamp duty revenue, as the property market bounced back. Howard Archer, of the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"The chancellor must be feeling an awful lot happier about life now than when he was preparing his autumn statement last year. If current trends were continued, the underlying public sector net borrowing requirement (PSNBR) would come in around \u00a3105bn in 2013/14 which is well below the target of \u00a3120bn.\" A Treasury spokesman welcomed the news, saying: \"Britain's hard work is paying off, the government's long-term economic plan is working, and the deficit is down by a third. But today's figures remind us that the job is far from done and a growing economy alone will not be enough to eliminate the deficit. The only way to ensure that the recovery is sustainable and the deficit keeps on coming down is to carry on taking difficult decisions to control government spending.\" However, Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the coalition had now borrowed more since 2010 than Labour did during its 13 years in power. \"This is the cost of economic failure and the three damaging years of flatlining and falling living standards we have seen since the election,\" he said. Total government spending was actually \u00a3600m higher in October than the same month last year, the ONS said, and in the year to date, is running at \u00a37.9bn, or 2.1% higher than in 2012-13. However, the ONS stressed that changes in the timing of grants to local authorities made year-on-year comparisons difficult. The ONS also reported that the government had used the \u00a32bn proceeds of last month's Royal Mail auction to pay down government debt, which totalled \u00a31,207.2bn, or 75.4% of GDP. Thursday's data included a revised calculation of total net borrowing for the last financial year, 2012-13, which the ONS now believes was \u00a3115bn, excluding temporary factors. That was \u00a33.5bn lower than in 2011-12, which will allow the chancellor to claim his plans for fixing the public finances are on track.",

      "bodyText": "The period since 2008 has produced a plentiful crop of recycled economic fallacies, mostly falling from the lips of political leaders. Here are my four favourites. The Swabian Housewife: \"One should simply have asked the Swabian housewife,\" said German chancellor Angela Merkel after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. \"She would have told us that you cannot live beyond your means.\" This sensible-sounding logic currently underpins austerity.

More than a thousand people are expected to demonstrate against the big six next Tuesday \u2013 the day that the latest winter mortality figures are published by the Office for National Statistics. Protesters will meet under the banner \"Bring down the big six \u2013 fuel poverty kills\" at Exchange Square in the centre of the City of London before marching with coffins filled with energy bills to npower's supply and trading offices at Threadneedle Street. Oxford-based campaigners will demonstrate outside the new headquarters of British Gas there, with further protests planned for Bristol and Lewes in Sussex. \"People must be put before profit, and with creative direct action, we will stand with the elderly, the poor and vulnerable to fight for our power. Fuel Poverty must end,\" said Sarah Price of UK Uncut. \"The big six are an example of incredible corporate greed. Huge profits are extracted from the public whilst they suffer at the hands of austerity. David Cameron and his cabinet of millionaires are only too happy to stuff the pockets of big business while ordinary people are left out in the cold.\" James Grainger of Fuel Poverty Action, also involved in the protests, said people were angry that the big six had tried to blame green taxes for putting up bills. \"The real problems are the big six's profiteering and the rising cost of polluting energy like oil and gas.

Next week's annual statistics on \"excess winter mortality\" will not break down how many of these extra deaths were caused by cold homes, but the World Health Authority estimated that 7,200 of the 24,000 extra British mortalities last winter were due to houses without proper heating. Betty Cottingham of the Greater London Pensioners Association, which is also supporting the protests, said her members had limited time to wait or change. \"We want an immediate response to the dire circumstances that pensioners live in.

Great news, they say, that the deficit is falling, but the Treasury is in no position to announce new give aways in the Autumn Statement on 5 December.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Autumn Statement is \u2013 for the third year in a row \u2013 set to be a \u201cfiscal event\u201d as the Chancellor George Osborne provides more detail on the giveaways announced during the party conference season. The data so far this year \u2013 including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/21/uk-public-finances-tax-ons-george-osborne\">today\u2019s public finance numbers</a> \u2013 suggest that we can expect to see a welcome upwards revision to the forecast for economic growth and a downward revision to the forecast for the headline deficit.</p> <p>But any improvement will be small relative to the level of the deficit forecast in the Budget, and the deficit this year will still be very high by historical standards and relative to what was projected at the start of this Parliament and compared to what the Chancellor is ultimately hoping to achieve. So as he prepares for the Autumn Statement, if the Chancellor is planning to make good on the promises of giveaways made during the party conference season he should also be considering ways of raising revenue to pay for them.</p> <p>When considering the scope for permanent net giveaways in the Autumn Statement, what matters is the extent to which any reduction in borrowing this year feeds into lower expected borrowing in future</p> <p>The OBR\u2019s March 2013 forecast was that the deficit would still be at \u00a342bn in 2017\u201318. That is to say, even after the implementation of all the austerity measures already announced up to 2015\u201316 plus those spending cuts pencilled in for 2016\u201317 and 2017\u201318, considerable further austerity (requiring either a further two year freeze in total public spending or a further net tax rise) would still be needed to meet Mr Osborne\u2019s proposed new deficit target. So perhaps any talk of pre-election giveaways should wait.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>We are finishing the blog early today folks, but thank you for joining us and please do join us again tomorrow.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-528e1ea9e4b0ee99dadf9b57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-21T15:16:21.066Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US markets are higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>US markets</strong> appear to have shrugged off yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/21/fed-tapering-fears-and-weak-chinese-manufacturing-worry-investors-live#block-528db08ae4b0ee99dadf9afe\">concerns about the short-term prospect of tapering</a>, instead taking an optimistic view following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/21/fed-tapering-fears-and-weak-chinese-manufacturing-worry-investors-live#block-528e0b51e4b0ee99dadf9b47\">stronger-than-expected jobs data</a>.</p> <p><strong>Dow Jones</strong>: +0.45% at 15,972.23</p> <p><strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>: +0.46% at 1,789.49</p> <p><strong>Nasdaq</strong>: +0.7% at 3,391.63</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-528e17dfe4b0ee99dadf9b52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-21T14:50:48.201Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US manufacturing rebounds to eight month high in November</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Markit</strong>'s flash <strong>US manufacturing PMI</strong> rose sharply in November to 54.3 from 51.8 in October.

The PMI bounced back from the fall seen in October, linked to business returning to normal after the uncertainty and disruption caused by the government shutdown.</p> <p>The recent index readings are consistent with manufacturing output growing 0.6% in the fourth quarter (equivalent to an annualised rate of 2.3%). However, even this pace of expansion is barely generating any employment growth, with the survey consistent with manufacturing payrolls rising by only 1,000 in November.</p> <p>The resilience of the manufacturing economy in the face of headwinds such as the shutdown and fiscal wrangling will add to calls for policy to be tapered. However, the recent drop in inflation to its lowest since October 2009 suggests that the Fed will be in no rush to tighten policy until the new year, eager instead to see the pace of growth show greater robustness and sustainability.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-528e11f0e4b0ee99dadf9b4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-21T14:19:54.230Z\">2.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">French farmers protest against rising taxes</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5ef8bf84-0120-424e-bc3f-3aec6894cc41\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385043543761/8fa4e239-ac22-4321-8716-0d8fb15aed01-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"French farmers blocked roads around Paris on Thursday in protest against rising taxes.

The good news is that borrowing in the first seven months of the financial year is 8% down on the same period of 2012-13. On current trends, the deficit will be around \u00a315bn lower for the full year than the chancellor expected at the time of the budget in the spring.</p> <p>That leaves Osborne in the position to offer a few sweeteners to the public in his autumn statement on 5 December. He is likely to resist the temptation for now to indulge in a pre-election giveaway, not least because borrowing is still on course to be a chunky \u00a3105bn this year. Even so, it is a nice choice to have.</p> <p>The bad news for the chancellor is that lower borrowing is largely the result of higher VAT and stamp duty receipts.

Here is a selection.</p> <p><strong> John Hawksworth,</strong> PwC\u2019s chief economist:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Public borrowing in October was little changed from last year, but in the first seven months of this financial year, the cumulative budget deficit was around \u00a36bn lower than the same period last year. This reflects underlying revenue growth of around 4% as compared to current expenditure growth of only around 2%.</p> <p>All of this suggests that the OBR should be able to reduce its public borrowing forecast for 2013/14 as a whole by around \u00a310-15bn. This reflects stronger economic growth and house prices boosting tax revenue growth, while spending has been kept broadly in line with plans.</p> <p>This public borrowing undershoot is likely to continue in future years, suggesting that by 2017/18, the headline budget deficit could be down to around \u00a320-30bn, compared to the OBR's estimate of \u00a342bn at the time of the Budget in March. This assumes that the Chancellor banks most of the borrowing undershoot, which seems to be the prudent thing to do at a time when the UK recovery is at an early stage and the eurozone remains fragile.</p> <p>However, there may be room for some modest net giveaways in the Autumn Statement to ease the pressure on living standards from rising energy prices in particular.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>David Tinsley</strong>, UK economist at BNP Paribas:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK public finances continue to show signs of improvement, though the absolute levels of the deficit are still large, with this year's deficit likely to come in over 6.5% of GDP.</p> <p>In 2013/14 so far borrowing is GBP 64.8bn, which is down from GBP 70.6bn. A simple extrapolation of this improvement would suggest a full year borrowing figure of GBP 105bn. This would be GBP 15bn lower than the OBR were forecasting back in the March Budget, or 1% of GDP. Things however are rarely that simple in the public accounts. Revenues in the first half of this year may have been boosted by tax shifting to take advantage of the lower higher rate of income tax. Still, it does look like there will be a significant undershoot on the OBR\u2019s forecasts.</p> <p>There are some signs that better economic prospects are helping the figures. VAT receipts are currently rising at double-digit rates compared to a year earlier. Stamp duty receipts are also rising strongly, with receipts up 31.6% on a year earlier for the first seven months of this fiscal year. On the spending side, the running total is 3.4% higher than the same period last year. The rise is largely reflecting higher interest payments. Core departmental spending is falling in cash terms, down 0.7%.</p> <p>Overall, there is room for optimism in the data.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Steven Bryce</strong>, European economist at Credit Suisse:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although [the borrowing] figure was a touch higher than consensus, a downward revision to borrowing in September helped to offset the difference. Overall, the rate of UK government borrowing appears to be declining. This suggests that there may be some positive news in the public finance projections in the Autumn Statement on December 5. Better fiscal projections could provide George Osborne with an opportunity to slightly loosen fiscal policy.</p> <p>Receipts growth has accelerated in past months, while expenditure growth has remained muted. Overall ... the potential of a continued cyclical improvement in borrowing in coming months.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/statuses/403510102193217536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>UK total national debt (PSND) fell a touch last month.

      "bodyText": "As usual the Institute for Fiscal Studies is there to tell us how it is on the UK public finances. Great news, they say, that the deficit is falling, but the Treasury is in no position to announce new give aways in the Autumn Statement on 5 December. The Autumn Statement is \u2013 for the third year in a row \u2013 set to be a \u201cfiscal event\u201d as the Chancellor George Osborne provides more detail on the giveaways announced during the party conference season. The data so far this year \u2013 including today\u2019s public finance numbers \u2013 suggest that we can expect to see a welcome upwards revision to the forecast for economic growth and a downward revision to the forecast for the headline deficit. But any improvement will be small relative to the level of the deficit forecast in the Budget, and the deficit this year will still be very high by historical standards and relative to what was projected at the start of this Parliament and compared to what the Chancellor is ultimately hoping to achieve. So as he prepares for the Autumn Statement, if the Chancellor is planning to make good on the promises of giveaways made during the party conference season he should also be considering ways of raising revenue to pay for them. When considering the scope for permanent net giveaways in the Autumn Statement, what matters is the extent to which any reduction in borrowing this year feeds into lower expected borrowing in future The OBR\u2019s March 2013 forecast was that the deficit would still be at \u00a342bn in 2017\u201318. That is to say, even after the implementation of all the austerity measures already announced up to 2015\u201316 plus those spending cuts pencilled in for 2016\u201317 and 2017\u201318, considerable further austerity (requiring either a further two year freeze in total public spending or a further net tax rise) would still be needed to meet Mr Osborne\u2019s proposed new deficit target. So perhaps any talk of pre-election giveaways should wait. We are finishing the blog early today folks, but thank you for joining us and please do join us again tomorrow. US markets appear to have shrugged off yesterday's concerns about the short-term prospect of tapering, instead taking an optimistic view following stronger-than-expected jobs data. Dow Jones: +0.45% at 15,972.23 S&amp;P 500: +0.46% at 1,789.49 Nasdaq: +0.7% at 3,391.63 Markit's flash US manufacturing PMI rose sharply in November to 54.3 from 51.8 in October. It was an eight month high, and a considerable rebound from the one-year low last month when the government shutdown caused disription. It's been a busy day for Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, who had this to say on the US figures: The flash PMI suggests that the manufacturing economy continues to expand at a reasonable but unspectacular rate. The PMI bounced back from the fall seen in October, linked to business returning to normal after the uncertainty and disruption caused by the government shutdown. The recent index readings are consistent with manufacturing output growing 0.6% in the fourth quarter (equivalent to an annualised rate of 2.3%). However, even this pace of expansion is barely generating any employment growth, with the survey consistent with manufacturing payrolls rising by only 1,000 in November. The resilience of the manufacturing economy in the face of headwinds such as the shutdown and fiscal wrangling will add to calls for policy to be tapered. However, the recent drop in inflation to its lowest since October 2009 suggests that the Fed will be in no rush to tighten policy until the new year, eager instead to see the pace of growth show greater robustness and sustainability. It hasn't been a great day for the French president Francois Hollande so far. Not only did respected data suggest France is perilously close to a return to recession, but French farmers have been blocking the roads around Paris with their tractors. Their beef is taxation, and more specifically a planned levy on road freight which trade unions have argued will cost thousands of jobs. One protesting farmer said today's demonstration reflected a broader malaise sweeping through France. \"People will have to realise that today it's farmers, but tomorrow it will be the truck drivers,\" Christophe Lerebours told Reuters. \"After that it will be employees in the private sector.\" Across the Atlantic there is some upbeat news on jobs. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell by more than expected last week. The number fell by 21,000 to 323,000 from a revised 344,000 a week earlier according to the US Labor Department. Economists had predicted a smaller fall to 335,000. It lowered the four-week moving average by 6,750 to 338,500 compared with last week. Annalisa Piazza of Newedge Strategy, suggested the data reflected a more broadly positive trend: The stronger than expected outcome finally pushed claims down to their pre-California computer switch-over levels, confirming that the labour market is progressively improving. Today's data seems to have overcome all the one-off factors that led to some volatility in claims over the past few weeks. Larry Elliott, the Guardian's economics editor, has pointed out there were mixed messages in today's public finances data from the ONS. There was good news and bad for George Osborne in the latest data for the public finances. The good news is that borrowing in the first seven months of the financial year is 8% down on the same period of 2012-13. On current trends, the deficit will be around \u00a315bn lower for the full year than the chancellor expected at the time of the budget in the spring. That leaves Osborne in the position to offer a few sweeteners to the public in his autumn statement on 5 December. He is likely to resist the temptation for now to indulge in a pre-election giveaway, not least because borrowing is still on course to be a chunky \u00a3105bn this year. Even so, it is a nice choice to have. The bad news for the chancellor is that lower borrowing is largely the result of higher VAT and stamp duty receipts. Treasury coffers are benefitting from a surge in consumer spending and the pick-up in the housing market. The bog-standard UK recovery, in other words, but not quite what Osborne promised back in 2010. Read the full blog here. European markets are mixed this afternoon. FTSE 100: 0.1% at 6,690.91 CAC 40: -0.36% at 4,253.05 DAX 30: -0.26% at 9,178.38 IBEX: +0.5% at 9,605.2 FTSE MIB: +0.57% at 18,833.67 Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said there was no news on the prospect of negative interest deposit in the eurozone during a speech in Germany. Draghi was keen to play down speculation (driven by a Bloomberg article) that the ECB was actively considering whether to essentially charge commercial banks to deposit money in a bid to encourage them to lend more. This is what Draghi had to say on Thursday: Let me plead with you - don't try to infer from what I say today anything on the possibility of negative rates on the deposit facility. As I said at the press conference [on 7 November], this was discussed in the last monetary policy meeting and there is no news since then. Deflation fears have been mounting in the eurozone with inflation at just 0.7% in October, and a cut in interest rates to 0.25% two weeks ago was widely interpreted as a move to curb a deflationary threat. Over in Greece, the government has presented its 2014 budget plans to parliament, following negotiations with the so-called Troika of international lenders comprising the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, and European Central Bank. Announcing the end of their visit on Thursday, the Troika said rather ominously that \"a few issues remain outstanding\". They won't be gone for long, with the next visit to Athens scheduled for early December. This from Helena Smith, the Guardian's correspondent in Athens: Barely 24 hours hours ahead of prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 much anticipated tete-a-tete with the German chancellor Angela Merkel, the Greek finance minister presented parliament with a 250-page document outlining next year\u2019s budget. Addressing the 300-seat house, Yannis Stournaras emphasized that it was a budget with a difference \u2013 predicated for the first time in more than a decade on Greece attaining a primary surplus of around \u20ac730m this year and around \u20ac2.8bn in 2014. \u201cThe bill will be discussed by the House in four sittings as of December 4th,\u201d said a finance ministry official. Most of the savings are projected to come from improved management of the state security system, extra tax revenues and mass asset stripping in the form of sales of state bodies \u2013 starting with the publicly-owned Road Fund, whose 167 employees were told they would be dismissed yesterday. But after weeks of strained negotiations with the country\u2019s \u2018troika\u201d of creditors it will be submitted without the endorsement of the EU, ECB or IMF and, as such, will likely be reworked at a later date. That\u2019s bad news for the government, which is finding it increasingly hard to hide that it will have to adopt yet more austerity measures to plug next year\u2019s looming budget black hole. It\u2019s not only relations with foreign lenders that are at an all-time low. Political tensions are also at an all\u2013time high with the main-opposition hard-line left turning up the heat on the government as it becomes increasingly more apparent that belt-tightening is on the horizon. More upbeat news as the UK's \"voice of business\", the CBI, reported the strongest rate of growth in manufacturing output and the highest level of new orders since 1995 in November. The results from the CBI industrial trends survey were better than expected, with export order books also above average, supporting the government's aspirations for a future UK economy dominated by overseas trade and not spending. Carl Williamson, manufacturing sector lead at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, mid markets, said: The positive sentiment in the manufacturing industry since spring and improved trading conditions have led to another increase in order levels for factories across the country. However, manufacturers, which have been buoyed with optimism in recent months, must not become complacent and should continue to invest in their operations, increase capacity and explore new markets if the sector is to reach its full potential. Economists have been offering their conclusions on the implications of today's UK public finances data. Here is a selection. John Hawksworth, PwC\u2019s chief economist: Public borrowing in October was little changed from last year, but in the first seven months of this financial year, the cumulative budget deficit was around \u00a36bn lower than the same period last year. This reflects underlying revenue growth of around 4% as compared to current expenditure growth of only around 2%. All of this suggests that the OBR should be able to reduce its public borrowing forecast for 2013/14 as a whole by around \u00a310-15bn. This reflects stronger economic growth and house prices boosting tax revenue growth, while spending has been kept broadly in line with plans. This public borrowing undershoot is likely to continue in future years, suggesting that by 2017/18, the headline budget deficit could be down to around \u00a320-30bn, compared to the OBR's estimate of \u00a342bn at the time of the Budget in March. This assumes that the Chancellor banks most of the borrowing undershoot, which seems to be the prudent thing to do at a time when the UK recovery is at an early stage and the eurozone remains fragile. However, there may be room for some modest net giveaways in the Autumn Statement to ease the pressure on living standards from rising energy prices in particular. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas: The UK public finances continue to show signs of improvement, though the absolute levels of the deficit are still large, with this year's deficit likely to come in over 6.5% of GDP. In 2013/14 so far borrowing is GBP 64.8bn, which is down from GBP 70.6bn. A simple extrapolation of this improvement would suggest a full year borrowing figure of GBP 105bn. This would be GBP 15bn lower than the OBR were forecasting back in the March Budget, or 1% of GDP. Things however are rarely that simple in the public accounts. Revenues in the first half of this year may have been boosted by tax shifting to take advantage of the lower higher rate of income tax. Still, it does look like there will be a significant undershoot on the OBR\u2019s forecasts. There are some signs that better economic prospects are helping the figures. VAT receipts are currently rising at double-digit rates compared to a year earlier. Stamp duty receipts are also rising strongly, with receipts up 31.6% on a year earlier for the first seven months of this fiscal year. On the spending side, the running total is 3.4% higher than the same period last year. The rise is largely reflecting higher interest payments. Core departmental spending is falling in cash terms, down 0.7%. Overall, there is room for optimism in the data. Steven Bryce, European economist at Credit Suisse: Although [the borrowing] figure was a touch higher than consensus, a downward revision to borrowing in September helped to offset the difference. Overall, the rate of UK government borrowing appears to be declining. This suggests that there may be some positive news in the public finance projections in the Autumn Statement on December 5. Better fiscal projections could provide George Osborne with an opportunity to slightly loosen fiscal policy. Receipts growth has accelerated in past months, while expenditure growth has remained muted. Overall ... the potential of a continued cyclical improvement in borrowing in coming months. Government borrowing fell to \u00a38.078bn in October from \u00a311.3bn in September and \u00a38.242bn in October 2012. It was an improvement but economists had forecast a bigger fall in the deficit to \u00a37.25bn. Nevertheless the fall in the deficit resulted from a pick-up in the economy and housing market which in turn boosted the Treasury's tax revenues. Borrowing fell despite the the Office for National Statistics decision to exclude the \u00a32bn proceeds of the government's Royal Mail sale, which would have flattered the figures. It did however include the 10% of shares awarded by the government to postal workers, which added \u00a3331m to borrowing in October. Britain's official and independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, will publish its revised assessment of the state of the public purse alongside the Chancellor's Autumn Statement on 5 December. It looks ever more likely now that full year borrowing will come in below the current forecast of \u00a3120bn. Howard Archer, chief UK and Eurpean economist at IHS Global Insight, said George Osborne must be feeling \"an awful lot happier\" than he was before the Autumn Statement last year, with the possibility of some modest giveaways: The Chancellor is likely to be in the happy position of announcing markedly increased GDP growth forecasts for 2013 and 2014 and also significantly reduced public sector deficit projections. If current trends were continued, [borrowing] would come in around \u00a3105bn in 2013/14 which is well below the target of \u00a3120bn. This will give the Chancellor some room for manouevre on policy in his Autumn Statement but he is highly likely to largely stick to his fiscal stance arguing that it has served the country well and it would be a major mistake to change course. The main headline grabbing moves in the Autumn Statement may be related to trying to limit energy bills and perhaps some more infrastructure investment initiatives. Not everyone was impressed though: The good news is that Markit's eurzone PMI's suggest the region's private sector grew for a fifth month in November. The bad news is growth slowed for a second month running, suggesting a lack of momentum and signalling weak growth of just 0.2% across the single currency bloc in the fourth quarter according to the report's authors. A breakdown of the data showed the eurozone's manufacturing PMI rose to a 29 month high of 51.5 in November from 51.3 in October (thanks to strength in Germany), while the services PMI dipped to a three month low of 50.9 from 51.6 a month earlier. Overall the flash composite index fell to a three-month low of 51.5 from 51.9 in October. Markit's Chris Williamson says the weakening PMIs will pile the pressure on the European Central Bank to do more save the troubled eurozone from another recession: The fall in the PMI for a second successive month suggests that the ECB was correct to cut interest rates to a record low at its last meeting, and the further loss of growth momentum will raise calls for policymakers to do more to prevent the eurozone from slipping back into another recession. Attention will also be focused on the signs that deflationary forces may be gathering. Prices charged for goods and services fell at a faster rate in November, despite firms\u2019 input costs rising at the steepest clip for over a year. Britain's car industry went from strenth to strength in October, with manufacturing up 17.4% to 160,854 vehicles. It was the largest monthly increase so far this year, driven by a massive rise in car production for the home market, which rose 52.4%. Manufacturing for exports also looked in decent shape, rising by 11.4% last month, and with positive signs even from Europe, where the car market has taken a hammering over recent years. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders which publishes the figures, is feeling chirpy: More than 15 brands build 50-plus models of car across the UK with volume and niche offerings providing a wealth of choice for our home and export markets. With European demand showing early signs of recovery, we expect production to continue positively in the coming months. In stark contrast to France, Germany's flash Markit PMIs suggested the private sector in Europe's largest economy was in fine form in November. Germany's manufacturing PMI rose to a 29 month high of 52.5 in November, from 51.7 in October, while the equivalent survey for the services sector rose to 54.5 from 52.9 - a nine month high. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the survey suggested German's private sector had built up a \"head of steam\" in the final quarter of 2013: There are also signs that solid growth momentum should be sustained over the months ahead, as new business received by private sector firms increased at the steepest pace for almost two-and-a-half years. \u201cBacklogs of work were accumulated across the German economy to the greatest degree since mid- 2011, providing encouragement that improvements in investment spending and job creation will follow in the wake of the upturn in business conditions.\u201d Germany's composite index, combining both the manufacturing and services PMIs, rose to a 10-month high of 54.3 in November from 53.2 in October. Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, said the November PMIs suggested the German economy was on course for 0.5% growth in the fourth quarter. European markets have not taken the weak French data, the Fed's message over tapering, and the Chinese PMIs well: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 6,647.03 CAC 40: -0.89% at 4,230.57 DAX 30: -0.82% at 9,126.58 IBEX: -0.78% at 9,486 FTSE MIB: -0.79% at 18580 The flash French PMIs from Markit have come in weaker than expected, indicating the private sector in Europe's second largest economy shrank for the first time in three months in November. The manufacturing PMI fell to a six-month low of 47.8 from 49.1, where anything below 50 points to contraction. The market had predicted a slight increase to 49.5. Meanwhile the services PMI dropped unexpectedly to a four-month low of 48.8 in November from 50.9 last month. Again, this went against economists expectations of a slight rise to 51. Here is what Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit had to say: November\u2019s Flash France PMI data highlight a disappointing slide in activity following two months of marginal growth. Renewed weakness was evident across both services and manufacturing, and the poor set of figures underline the fragility of the economy in the face of a persistently anaemic demand environment. Although remaining above the levels seen in the first half of the year, PMI data highlight the risk of a return to recession for France in Q4 following the -0.1% fall in GDP during Q3. The news was rather grim on the jobs front too, with the combined manufacturing and services indices suggesting employment in France's private sector fell again in November, having risen for the first time in 20 months in October. More reaction and the German PMIs to follow. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Minutes from the October meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee have triggered fresh concerns among investors that the Fed could begin to slow its bond buying programme as soon as December. The comment that the committee expected ongoing improvement which would therefore \"warrant trimming the pace of purchases in coming months\" sent 10-bond yields higher and US markets lower. Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK: If you were to gauge market reaction to last night\u2019s Fed minutes then it would not be unreasonable to think that markets were looking at the potential for tapering to start next month. A spike in 10 year US treasury yields by nearly 10 basis points to 2.80% and a fall in US stock markets would appear to suggest that investors remain concerned by just such an event, and as such we can expect to see a similarly negative start in Europe this morning. Meanwhile in China overnight, the flash Markit/HSBC manufacturing PMI slowed to 50.4 in November from 50.9 in October, raising concerns that growth overall was flagging.",

The good news is that borrowing in the first seven months of the financial year is 8% down on the same period of 2012-13. On current trends, the deficit will be around \u00a315bn lower for the full year than the chancellor expected at the time of the budget in the spring. That leaves Osborne in the position to offer a few sweeteners to the public in his autumn statement on 5 December. He is likely to resist the temptation for now to indulge in a pre-election giveaway, not least because borrowing is still on course to be a chunky \u00a3105bn this year. Even so, it is a nice choice to have. The bad news for the chancellor is that lower borrowing is largely the result of higher VAT and stamp duty receipts. Treasury coffers are benefiting from a surge in consumer spending and the pick-up in the housing market. The bog-standard UK recovery, in other words, but not quite what Osborne promised back in 2010. To be fair, the latest snapshot of industry from the CBI shows that stronger domestic demand is boosting the order books and output of manufacturers. This, though, has yet to be reflected in corporation tax receipts, which were 8% lower in October than they were a year earlier. Labour made the point that the coalition has borrowed more in the past three years than Labour did in its 13 years in office, and that this is a measure of how austerity has failed even on its own terms. Whether the opposition will get any political traction with this argument remains to be seen. Polling evidence suggests that voters believe that the Gordon Brown government rather than the global financial crisis was responsible for the big deterioration in the public finances between 2007 and 2010. Osborne's argument since he became chancellor is that it has been left to him to clear up an unholy mess left by Labour. We are likely to hear more of this on 5 December.",

The apparently lax oversight of the company's financial regime by the energy regulator was heavily criticised last week by Tim Yeo, the former chairman of parliament's energy and climate change committee. Today the Grid, whose electricity and gas transmission charges have partly been blamed by power suppliers for their own bill increases, rewarded shareholders with a sizeable 14.49p per share dividend. Steve Holliday, the Grid chief executive, defended the payout and the scale of profits saying they were needed to retain shareholder support for new investment in energy networks, which will cost \u00a33.5bn this year alone. \"We continue to invest efficiently in essential regulated assets on both sides of the Atlantic, providing our customers with reliable networks while generating value and driving growth.\" Operating profits were down 1% on the same period last year while pre-tax profits came in at just under \u00a31bn and were 7% below the comparative figure for 2012. The bulk of the earnings come from the UK where the level of profits allowed for looking after the pipes and pylons is controlled by the regulator, Ofgem, unlike the energy suppliers who can set their own tariff levels. But Yeo told the Energy UK annual conference in London that a weak Ofgem was being too lenient in its price-setting agreements. \"I think they [the Grid] need something more ferocious than the patsy down the road in Whitehall.\"",
