      "bodyText": "Authorities in Monaco have raided the headquarters of an oil company, as well as the homes of some of its bosses, as part of a British-led investigation into a corruption scandal implicating businesses all over the world, the principality\u2019s government has said. In a statement released on Thursday, it said that the Monaco-based firm Unaoil was at the centre of the inquiry and that officials had acted after an urgent request for assistance from the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office (SFO). \u201cThese searches and interviews were carried out in the presence of British officials as part of a vast, international corruption scandal implicating numerous foreign oil industry firms. The information collected is going to be examined by the British authorities as part of their investigation,\u201d the statement said. It said that the executives had been interviewed over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday this week. The Monacan authorities said they acted in accordance with European convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters and the UN convention against transnational organised crime. An SFO spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of the allegations but can neither confirm nor deny our interest in the matter.\u201d A Unaoil spokesperson said: \u201cDue to recent developments it would be inappropriate for the company to comment at this time.\u201d Unaoil was at the centre of allegations published by the Huffington Post and Australia\u2019s Fairfax Media on Wednesday. They said the business \u201csystematically corrupted the global oil industry\u201d by delivering millions in bribes on behalf of well-known multinationals to secure contracts. The company has denied the allegations. Asked by both publications whether Unaoil paid bribes, the company\u2019s chief executive, Ata Ahsani, was quoted as saying: \u201cThe answer is absolutely no.\u201d The publications said they drew on information gleaned from hundreds of thousands of internal emails between 2002 and 2012 for their six-month investigation. Fairfax, which described the trove as \u201cthe biggest leak of confidential files in the history of the oil industry,\u201d said the files held evidence of bribes paid to Middle Eastern oil chiefs and other officials. Fairfax said Unaoil did not challenge of the authenticity of the documents involved and instead sent a letter through its lawyers demanding that Fairfax wipe the material from its servers.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British companies have been urged to do more to support the crisis-hit steel industry after it emerged that just two construction groups have pledged to use domestically produced steel. The Charter for Sustainable British Steel was set up last year by industry representatives in an attempt to secure the future of the ailing sector as users of steel increasingly turn to cheap Chinese products. However, only Balfour Beatty, which built the aquatics centre for the London 2012 Olympics, and Morgan Sindall have signed up to the charter. The charter asks businesses to pledge to only use a type of steel produced by Tata and a Cardiff-based steelworks run by Finnish firm Celsa. Around 40,000 jobs are at risk after Tata Steel revealed it is planning to pull out of the UK, blaming its financial woes on the glut of cheap Chinese steel being imported into the country. Chinese imports now account for a third of UK steel consumption, despite none meeting the BES 6001 standard achieved by Tata and Celsa products, which means the steel has been produced in a \u201csustainable and responsible manner\u201d. The government has described steel as a strategic asset and said it will look at the viable options for securing the industry\u2019s future. Anna Turley, the MP for Redcar and secretary of the all-party parliamentary group for steel, urged members of the trade body for British builders to back the charter. \u201cMembers of Build UK ... must help support the British steel industry by committing to use steel rebar that meets BES 6001. As companies that rely heavily on publicly funded contracts, they have a duty to support the UK economy, not those of China and Turkey,\u201d she said. Build UK members who have not signed the charter include Wates, Mace, Willmott Dixon, Kier and Interserve. Seven local authorities, including Manchester city council, have also signed the charter, as has the Welsh government. Key government-backed infrastructure projects that are overwhelmingly using British steel include Crossrail, High Speed 2, and the country\u2019s new aircraft carriers. Network Rail, the operator of Britain\u2019s rail infrastructure, said it buys more than 140,000 tonnes of steel rail each year and 98% is made in Britain. A Network Rail spokesman said: \u201cTata Steel is one of the most important links in our supply chain, providing the majority of our steel rail from its subsidiary, Longs Steel UK, in Scunthorpe. We\u2019re certain that both Longs Steel and its current prospective buyer remain absolutely committed to helping us build a bigger, better railway for Britain.\u201d EEF, the manufacturing trade body, said the government needed to ensure that as much British steel as possible is used in infrastructure projects. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, said: \u201cBetter use of public procurement is a vital part of the future of the steel industry in the UK. \u201cGovernment has a vital role to play in ensuring that British steel companies are given the opportunity and, where possible, assistance through the contracting process to secure orders for major infrastructure projects from HS2 to Hinkley Point.\u201d Representatives of the construction industry defended the lack of signatories to the charter, claiming that it referred to BES 6001 steel, which can be produced outside of Britain, rather than simply British steel. A spokesperson for Build UK said: \u201cBuild UK members are committed to providing opportunities for British-based steel producers in order to support local economies, job creation, and to reduce carbon emissions from transport. \u201cThe procurement of steel plays an important role in supporting the industry, and Build UK is currently developing guidance for its members which will address the barriers that prevent British-based steel producers competing effectively for contracts.\u201d The automotive, aerospace and defence industries also expressed their backing for the steel industry. Steel produced at the Tata-owned Port Talbot works is used in the manufacturing of Nissan Juke cars at its plant in the UK\u2019s biggest car factory in Sunderland. However, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders was unable to say what percentage of the steel used to make cars in Britain was domestically sourced, and said more needed to be done to support local sourcing. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the UK\u2019s car industry trade body, the SMMT, said: \u201cCost, quality and logistics are key elements to the efficient sourcing of materials and components by UK automotive manufacturers, and high quality steel purchased from a variety of providers, including in the UK, is an important part of this. \u201cAlthough the wider automotive supply chain in the UK is undergoing a resurgence, more work is needed to support and develop the provision of local content \u2013 a focus of both government and industry through the Automotive Council.\u201d The steel used in the aerospace and defence industry needs to be produced to high technical specifications, the defence trade association ADS said. Paul Everitt, its chief executive, said: \u201cUK defence and aerospace manufacturers procure steel according to specific technical requirements. This steel comes from UK-based as well as overseas mills; however, given the specifications involved, the current issues affecting industrial steel have not had an impact.\u201d Amid calls for the British government to nationalise Tata Steel, there is one recent example of the private sector stepping into protect the industry. Three of Britain\u2019s biggest industrial companies clubbed together to provide aid to Sheffield Forgemasters, another steelworks, earlier this year. Defence firms BAE Systems and Babcock joined industrial group Rolls-Royce in agreeing to underwrite just under \u00a330m in bank loans to the steelmaker in a deal brokered by the Ministry of Defence. Sheffield Forgemasters is a supplier to Britain\u2019s Trident nuclear submarine programme and the support was provided by Submarine Enterprise Partners, the private sector consortium that will develop the next generation of submarines. However, another key Tata customer in the engineering industry said the steel industry had become \u201cunworkable\u201d and needed to change. \u201cRealistically, things have got to happen and things have got to change,\u201d the industry source said. The source said that their company had gone from sourcing 85% to 90% of their steel from Britain a year ago to just 50% now, after Tata made cutbacks at its sites.",

      "bodyText": "Andy Cole has been forging steel in the same workshop in the Highfield area of Sheffield since he was 14 years old, 40 years ago. The building where he works, a stone\u2019s throw from Sheffield United\u2019s Bramall Lane football ground, is said to be where, in 1913, the metallurgist Harry Brearley made the world\u2019s first stainless steel cutlery. Cole is one of the city\u2019s surviving \u201clittle mesters\u201d, a term used for the craftsmen who rented the city\u2019s redbrick workshops to work with the steel produced in the surrounding areas. He has seen the demise of Sheffield\u2019s steel industry at close quarters. The news this week of Tata Steel\u2019s decision to pull out of all its UK operations came as no surprise to him. In 2011, Cole said, he was forced to shut the doors on his tool-making business, which employed 11 people, and set up shop on his own as a specialist maker of made-to-measure hand tools. The problems facing his business were the same as those facing the UK steel industry at large, namely the influx of cheaper products from abroad. Tools like the ones made by his business were being sold from China for less than it cost him to buy the steel in the first place, he said. \u201cI tried weathering the storm until eventually we ran out of money.\u201d Of Cole\u2019s customers, 90% are now from the US and are attracted by the \u201cmade in Sheffield\u201d label and the quality it denotes, he said. What is left of Sheffield\u2019s steel industry, which employs about 2,600 people, largely concerns the manufacture of specialised steel products. Sheffield Forgemasters, the biggest steel industry employer in the city, employing about 630 people, announced plans in February to cut 100 jobs from its plant in the Brightside area of the city. The private company, which makes parts for the submarines carrying the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear weapons, also reported its first-ever loss, of \u00a39.4m, for the 18 months to the end of 2014. Graham Honeyman, chief executive at Sheffield Forgemasters, described Tata Steel\u2019s announcement on selling its UK business as a \u201csad development\u201d and said he hoped a resolution could be found to prevent it happening. \u201cSheffield Forgemasters operates in very different markets to the bulk steel manufacturers,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it would be wrong for us to comment on specifics of what is happening in that sector. However, we would all hope for a situation where British manufacturers are given priority for UK infrastructure and engineering projects and are allowed to compete through fair energy costs.\u201d Cole\u2019s business is based in Portland Works, a building that has housed the craftsmen of Sheffield\u2019s metalwork trade since 1879. It was saved from being turned into student flats in 2013 after a four-year campaign by the local community. As well as the surviving craft workers of the city\u2019s declining steel industry, it is also home to younger newcomers, who are taking advantage of the cheap rents to start businesses. Stuart Mitchell makes bespoke knives from a workshop that has been home to his family\u2019s business since 1980. He became an apprentice to his father as soon as he left school in 1985, and his father-in-law, 71-year-old Michael Shaw, works as a metal engraver just across the courtyard. Mitchell described Tata\u2019s decision to withdraw from the UK as disappointing and said that it was \u201cjust another piece of history lost\u201d. Many of Sheffield\u2019s cutlery makers had also been put out of business because they could not compete with cheaper products from overseas, he added. \u201cI got around that by specialising and not trying to compete. But it can\u2019t be that easy with organisations the size of the steel makers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m only 46, but I\u2019ve really seen the Sheffield steel industry dwindle away and it\u2019s sad to see. When I started it was more about quantity rather than quality. Now it\u2019s all about the quality rather than the quantity \u2013 making individual items and bespoke items.\u201d",

The building where he works, a stone\u2019s throw from Sheffield United\u2019s Bramall Lane football ground, is said to be where, in 1913, the metallurgist Harry Brearley made the world\u2019s first stainless steel cutlery.</p> <p>Cole is one of the city\u2019s surviving \u201clittle mesters\u201d, a term used for the craftsmen who rented the city\u2019s redbrick workshops to work with the steel produced in the surrounding areas.

Tools like the ones made by his business were being sold from China for less than it cost him to buy the steel in the first place, he said. \u201cI tried weathering the storm until eventually we ran out of money.\u201d Of Cole\u2019s customers, 90% are now from the US and are attracted by the \u201cmade in Sheffield\u201d label and the quality it denotes, he said.</p> <p>What is left of Sheffield\u2019s steel industry, which employs about 2,600 people, largely concerns the manufacture of specialised steel products.</p> <p>Sheffield Forgemasters, the biggest steel industry employer in the city, employing about 630 people, announced plans in February to cut 100 jobs from its plant in the Brightside area of the city.

Many of Sheffield\u2019s cutlery makers had also been put out of business because they could not compete with cheaper products from overseas, he added. </p> <p>\u201cI got around that by specialising and not trying to compete.

      "bodyText": "The competition between two \u201cflash boy\u201d financial trading firms over plans to build communications masts higher than the Shard, in rural Kent, has intensified. New Line Networks (NLN) and Vigilant Global \u2013 high-frequency trading firms that use super-fast infrastructure to make trades in the blink of an eye \u2013 want to build masts within a few miles of each other in Richborough. The masts would allow them to beam microwave signals across the Channel, transmitting signals to and from European markets a fraction of a second quicker than rivals. But Vigilant\u2019s plan could be slowed dramatically after NLN \u2013 owned by Jump Trading and KCG Holdings \u2013 filed an objection to its planning application. In a submission to Dover council, NLN said Vigilant should show that its plans would not affect a nearby railway route and that the impact on overhead power lines had not been properly considered. NLN also raised concerns about the position of blocks used to keep the mast in place and the location of access roads during the construction phase. It said its submission to the council was designed to ensure \u201cthe consideration of each proposal is against a background of rigorous, comprehensive and robust evidence\u201d. \u201cWe would suggest that determination of the planning application should not take place until the information has been made available and has been subject to appropriate consultation.\u201d Vigilant is further ahead with its mast as it has already submitted a planning application, whereas NLN has only got as far as publishing a \u201cscoping assessment\u201d. Securing a delay to Vigilant\u2019s planning process would help NLN catch up, as the two firms slug it out to get their mast up first. Eric Bellerive, the director of global networks at Vigilant, said: \u201cWe are working with Dover district council, as the determining local authority, to respond to feedback from all parties following submission of the planning application and the public engagement programme. \u201cAs part of this process we are finalising a number of proposed public benefits, including a community trust to be funded annually by mast revenue and managed by the local community. \u201cWe recognise the benefits of working in partnership with other users, including financial firms, to deliver this important infrastructure, and have been actively engaged with other firms in our industry throughout the planning process, including discussions with New Line Networks regarding shared access to the proposed mast.\u201d The battle illustrates the lengths to which high-frequency traders are willing to go to secure a couple of milliseconds advantage over rivals. The focus on speed earned the industry the nickname \u201cflash boys\u201d, after the Michael Lewis book. It details how a company called Spread Networks dug an 827-mile trench under mountains and across rivers from Chicago to New Jersey \u2013 at a cost of $300m. The result was an ultra-latency line that reduced the time taken to transmit data from one end to the other from 17 milliseconds to 13 milliseconds. Both Vigilant and NLN say the masts, both of which would be higher than the Shard at more than 1,000ft, will also improve local internet and mobile phone reception. But people living in the area are sceptical about the prospect of giant masts being erected, close to the site where the Roman conquest of Britain began in AD43. NLN is due to give a public presentation about its plans on 4 April at Ash village hall.",

      "bodyText": "The Prudential has never been accused of underpaying its executives so, in a sense, 2015 was far from a vintage year for the insurer\u2019s top folk. The nine boardroom executives had to struggle by on \u00a340.7m between the lot of them, a comedown from the previous year\u2019s \u00a353.3m. And chief executive Tidjane Thiam, who left to join Credit Suisse last summer, never quite reached the round figure of \u00a350m in earnings over the course of his six-year stay. His final tally was \u00a348m. The Prudential is a large and successful company \u2013 and its level of disclosure on pay is excellent \u2013 but these are extraordinary sums. The going-rate for a chief executive of a FTSE 100 firm is \u00a35m-a-year these days once the full paraphernalia of salary, benefits, bonuses, incentives and pension payments is totted up. At the Pru, it is now standard that four or five executives beat that level in a decent year. In addition, three employees outside the boardroom \u2013 probably fund managers at M&amp;G \u2013 earned \u00a35m-plus last year. Investors, no doubt, will merrily approve the remuneration report at the annual meeting. The ill-named \u201cshareholder spring\u201d of 2012, in which the Pru suffered a minor revolt, is a distant memory. Companies with strong share prices sleep quietly these days. But, before they tick the \u201capprove\u201d box, let\u2019s hope a few investors query the housing benefits granted to Mike Wells, Thiam\u2019s successor, after his move to London from the US. One can understand that the Pru would pick up his shipping costs of \u00a3200,000 and a bill for temporary accommodation, even if it was an impressive \u00a3177,890. But then it paid \u00a3513,750 to cover the stamp duty on the house Wells bought in the UK. Further, the Pru has agreed to pay the interest on Wells\u2019s mortgage for three years \u2013 that came to \u00a356,604 for a period of less than 12 months, and maybe substantially less since the promotion only happened in June. Nobody doubts that Wells was the right man for the job: he had led the Pru\u2019s successful US business for years. But have we really reached the point where an executive who would hope to earn \u00a310m a year can put his mortgage interest payments on the company\u2019s tab? It\u2019s all standard practice in relocations these days, argues the Pru. Maybe that is correct, but it does reinforce a point the High Pay Centre has making for ages: perks are the hidden inflator in boardroom pay and the executive class lives by different rules. Brighter news from AO World John Roberts, founder and chief executive of AO World, seems to have learned from experience: cut the hype and show that you are concentrating on running the business. In February last year, the City was seriously miffed by a profits warning from the online electrical retailer that came less than a year after flotation. Roberts\u2019s insistence that it was just \u201ca slight miss\u201d and that shareholders should look to the long-term was interpreted as arrogance. As it happens, the judgment was unfair \u2013 in person, Roberts is not the brash individual of caricature \u2013 but the share price went on the blink. On Thursday, AO came bearing brighter news. Top-line earnings in the UK are running ahead of expectations at about \u00a317m for the year. Over on the continent, revenues from the launches into Germany and the Netherlands are running to plan. A chance to have a dig at the doubters? If it was, Roberts declined. He spent the day telling City analysts not to get over-excited. Very sensible, too. If AO really is to become a pan-European disruptive powerhouse \u2013 an Amazon of fridges and freezers with turnover counted in the billions \u2013 the task will take years to complete. Best to treat quarterly trading updates as suitably irrelevant. Brexit and steel Let\u2019s, please, forget the idea that leaving the European Union would save Port Talbot. Yes, it is true the UK would be freer to impose tariffs against cheap Chinese steel, assuming the current government performed a complete U-turn on the idea. And, in theory, the UK might be able to nationalise the steelworks at will or throw subsidies at a would-be buyer. But, if a post-Brexit UK also wanted to negotiate access to the EU single market with minimal trade barriers, Brussels\u2019 first demand would be adherence to its state aid rules. Maybe the EU would be happy to grant a carve-out for a UK strategic industry like steel \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t bet a single euro on that hope.",

And chief executive Tidjane Thiam, who left to join Credit Suisse last summer, never quite reached the round figure of \u00a350m in earnings over the course of his six-year stay. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/tidjane-thiam-earned-5m-pounds-at-prudential-in-five-months\">His final tally was \u00a348m.</a></p> <p>The Prudential is a large and successful company \u2013 and its level of disclosure on pay is excellent \u2013 but these are extraordinary sums. The going-rate for a chief executive of a FTSE 100 firm is \u00a35m-a-year these days once the full paraphernalia of salary, benefits, bonuses, incentives and pension payments is totted up. At the Pru, it is now standard that four or five executives beat that level in a decent year. In addition, three employees outside the boardroom \u2013 probably fund managers at M&amp;G \u2013 earned \u00a35m-plus last year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/tidjane-thiam-earned-5m-pounds-at-prudential-in-five-months\">Tidjane Thiam earned \u00a35m at Prudential in five months</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Investors, no doubt, will merrily approve the remuneration report at the annual meeting. The ill-named \u201cshareholder spring\u201d of 2012, in which the Pru suffered a minor revolt, is a distant memory. Companies with strong share prices sleep quietly these days.</p> <p>But, before they tick the \u201capprove\u201d box, let\u2019s hope a few investors query the housing benefits granted to Mike Wells, Thiam\u2019s successor, after his move to London from the US.</p> <p>One can understand that the Pru would pick up his shipping costs of \u00a3200,000 and a bill for temporary accommodation, even if it was an impressive \u00a3177,890. But then it paid \u00a3513,750 to cover the stamp duty on the house Wells bought in the UK. Further, the Pru has agreed to pay the interest on Wells\u2019s mortgage for three years \u2013 that came to \u00a356,604 for a period of less than 12 months, and maybe substantially less since the promotion only happened in June.</p> <p>Nobody doubts that Wells was the right man for the job: he had led the Pru\u2019s successful US business for years. But have we really reached the point where an executive who would hope to earn \u00a310m a year can put his mortgage interest payments on the company\u2019s tab?</p> <p>It\u2019s all standard practice in relocations these days, argues the Pru. Maybe that is correct, but it does reinforce a point the High Pay Centre has making for ages: perks are the hidden inflator in boardroom pay and the executive class lives by different rules.</p> <h2>Brighter news from AO World</h2> <p>John Roberts, founder and chief executive of AO World, seems to have learned from experience: cut the hype and show that you are concentrating on running the business.</p> <p>In February last year, the City was seriously miffed by a profits warning from the online electrical retailer that came less than a year after flotation. Roberts\u2019s insistence that it was just \u201ca slight miss\u201d and that shareholders should look to the long-term was interpreted as arrogance. As it happens, the judgment was unfair \u2013 in person, Roberts is not the brash individual of caricature \u2013 but the share price went on the blink.</p> <p>On Thursday, AO came bearing brighter news. Top-line earnings in the UK are running ahead of expectations at about \u00a317m for the year. Over on the continent, revenues from the launches into Germany and the Netherlands are running to plan.</p> <p>A chance to have a dig at the doubters? If it was, Roberts declined. He spent the day telling City analysts not to get over-excited. Very sensible, too. If AO really is to become a pan-European disruptive powerhouse \u2013 an Amazon of fridges and freezers with turnover counted in the billions \u2013 the task will take years to complete. Best to treat quarterly trading updates as suitably irrelevant.</p> <h2>Brexit and steel</h2> <p>Let\u2019s, please, forget the idea that leaving the European Union would save Port Talbot. Yes, it is true the UK would be freer to impose tariffs against cheap Chinese steel, assuming the current government performed a complete U-turn on the idea. And, in theory, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/potential-options-government-tata-steel-port-talbot\">the UK might be able to nationalise the steelworks at will</a> or throw subsidies at a would-be buyer.</p> <p>But, if a post-Brexit UK also wanted to negotiate access to the EU single market with minimal trade barriers, Brussels\u2019 first demand would be adherence to its state aid rules. Maybe the EU would be happy to grant a carve-out for a UK strategic industry like steel \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t bet a single euro on that hope.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The billionaire owner of the Gherkin, one of London\u2019s most recognisable skyscrapers, has been charged in an alleged plot to bribe Brazilian officials in an attempt to cut his family company\u2019s corporation tax bill. Joseph Safra, the world\u2019s richest banker with an estimated $18.3bn (\u00a312.8bn) fortune according to Forbes magazine, was on Thursday accused of corruption in relation to a conspiracy to pay 15.3m reais ($4.2m) in bribes to tax officials, Brazilian prosecutors said. Safra, who bought 30 St Mary\u2019s Axe \u2013 better known as the Gherkin \u2013 for a reported \u00a3726m in 2014, was charged over the alleged 2014 scheme designed to reduce the tax bill for Banco Safra, Brazil\u2019s 10th biggest bank which he owns the majority of. The Brazilian authorities said Safra was not directly involved with the alleged corruption scheme, but said there is evidence that an employee was acting on his instructions when he arranged the alleged deal. The authorities said they had wire taps of conversations between a Safra executive, Jo\u00e3o In\u00e1cio Puga, and tax officials. \u201cHe [Puga] limited himself to negotiating, interacting with the other people under investigation,\u201d the prosecutors said of the alleged scheme. \u201cBut the decisions were taken by [what Puga called] the \u2018staff\u2019, that is, Grupo Safra\u2019s majority shareholder and president, Joseph Y Safra. Therefore, Puga was Joseph\u2019s agent.\u201d A spokesperson for the Safra Group said: \u201cThe allegations being promoted by a Brazilian prosecutor are unfounded. There have not been any improprieties by any of the businesses of The Safra Group. No representative of the group offered any inducement to any public official and the group did not receive any benefit in the judgement of the tribunal.\u201d The charges filed are a follow-up to a Brazilian police inquiry, known as \u201cOperation Zealots\u201d, into kickbacks by companies through lobbyists. Dozens of other Brazilian firms have also been under investigation for suspected kickbacks. Safra and his family control the S\u00e3o Paulo-based bank as part of a international conglomerate operating in 19 countries. When it bought the Lord Foster-designed Gherkin in November 2014, Safra Group said: \u201cWhile only 10 years old, this building is already a London icon that is distinguished from others in the market, with excellent value growth potential. We intend to make the building even better and more desirable through active ownership that will lead to a range of enhancements that will benefit tenants.\u201d Safra is Brazil\u2019s second-richest person after Jorge Paulo Lemann, who owns a big stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brewing giant behind Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois. Safra was born into a rich banking family in Lebanon. The family moved to S\u00e3o Paulo in 1952. He and father Jacob Safra founded Banco Safra in the 1960s.",

      "bodyText": "It is hard not to be too cynical about the government\u2019s approach to the steel crisis (Nationalisation not the answer to steel crisis, says David Cameron, theguardian.com, 31 March). It is unwilling to make any long-term commitment to save the industry. Instead, it looks to a series of short-term fixes to stave off closure of plants such as Port Talbot until after the May elections. If as expected no saviour for the industry appears, the government will adopt its preferred option of allowing the industry to close, selling off those assets that can be sold and converting the old sites into shopping centres, warehouses or theme parks. The folly of this approach can be shown with reference to the trade deficit, which at 6% of GDP is the highest of any in the developed world. This will only worsen when all steel in future has to be imported. There is a very real danger that the lost British steel will be replaced by imported Chinese steel of an inferior quality. I can cite as an example a British engineering firm whose American owners decided to import Chinese components for the products they produced. These cheap Chinese components were of such poor quality that they had to be re-engineered, prior to being used in production. The British government is as short sighted as these American owners, preferring the cheap option regardless of long-term damage to the economy that will result from its actions. Derrick Joad Leeds \u2022 Current political confusion in Britain should not blind us to the difficult strategic choices needed to get our economy moving in the right direction. Pent-up needs for much better infrastructure and affordable housing should enable Britain to build its way out of a hole, as Germany has done so well. But Larry Elliott (Key is sticking to an industrial strategy, 31 March) misses the key roles played by the state investment bank KfW, the cooperative savings banks, and the federal political system. We should use the crises over our steel, energy (and no doubt railways) to overhaul the way major development and infrastructure decisions are taken. The answers include devolving power over infrastructure investment to European-style regions and local investment banks. We also need a municipal investment corporation to vet the projects, rather than emergency cabinet meetings. Dr Nicholas Falk Director, London office, Urbed (Urbanism Environment and Design) Ltd \u2022 Stephen Kinnock MP is quoted as suggesting the government is \u201crolling out the red carpet to get market status at the World Trade Organisation\u201d and suggested Britain is the \u201cringleader\u201d in blocking European commission attempts to improve anti-dumping policies (on Chinese steel) because our commercial and overall policy is being \u201cdictated by Beijing\u201d (Ministers in \u201cdisarray\u201d over steel industry, 31 March). This analysis needs to be spelled out more explicitly. It seems our steel is being sacrificed on the atomic altar of keeping China sweet over its investment in the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, confidence in which is eroding even in France (Member of EDF board urges power plant delay, 31 March). British engagement with China over nuclear power dates back to the autumn of 2013, when chancellor George Osborne visited Beijing to seek investment in the Hinkley C project from the Chinese government and was finalised last September. The trade unionists now rightly defending their jobs and the steel industry should have words with the leadership of the Unite union, who are even more gung-ho for Hinkley C to go ahead than Conservative ministers, and point out they are not prepared to sacrifice their livelihoods for this astronomically expensive atomic white elephant, just to keep the Chinese on side. Dr David Lowry Senior research fellow, Institute for Resource and Security Studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA \u2022 Nils Pratley comments (Analysis, 31 March) that the UK government cannot be blamed directly for foot-dragging in Brussels over the application of import tariffs to dumped Chinese steel. The time being taken to settle this issue is not the only concern. You reported a couple of weeks ago that the UK government was lobbying for the lowest possible tariff to be set; a mere 16% or so, which would doubtless be shrugged off by China (compare the US\u2019s 266%). If this is indeed the government\u2019s position, it deserves to be widely known, as undermining its feeble pleas that it is doing \u201ceverything it can\u201d to preserve a UK steel industry. Valerie Bayliss Sheffield \u2022 When the banking industry was close to collapse eight years ago, banks were nationalised speedily and with the full support of Conservative MPs including David Cameron. This saved many jobs. It secured the future of the industry and that of many who benefit from it. Today the steel industry faces a similar existential threat but Cameron says nationalisation is not the answer. Can anyone explain to me why our steel industry today deserves less prompt and effective action than our banking industry did then? Nigel Lindsay Bo\u2019ness, West Lothian \u2022 Comforting to know that at least we\u2019ll have Trident even if we can\u2019t even roll a sheet of steel any more. Martin Jeeves (Ex-Steel Company of Wales, Port Talbot, 1967), Cardiff \u2022 Tata corporation \u2013 Indian global conglomerate \u2013 is closing Port Talbot steelworks. No great surprise since these global businesses are only interested in making money; no interest at all in maintaining employment in any particular country. Port Talbot is said to be losing \u00a31m a day. Reasons given are cheap Chinese imports, high energy costs \u2013 some 50% higher than in France and Germany \u2013 and high business rates. All of these are to some extent a consequence of government policy or neglect. Conservative governments are not interested in protecting heavy industry that employs very large numbers of ordinary workers and where unions are potentially strong; look at what happened to coal mining, shipbuilding, British owned car manufacturing, etc. The present government is dependent on French and, it hopes, Chinese money to finance Hinkley Point nuclear construction and for many infrastructure projects, so it doesn\u2019t want to annoy the Chinese by doing anything about their \u201cdumping\u201d of cheap steel. The government also argues that, even if it wanted to, it cannot use taxpayers\u2019 money to save Port Talbot because of EU restrictions on state aid; curious how the EU is apparently to blame. How is it possible therefore for Germany, France and Italy to have state involvement in so much of their manufacturing industries? Thousands of millions of pounds, were used without question to rescue banks from the mess they had created. Why then cannot smaller sums be used to rescue a heavy industry whose problems are not of its own making, which employs a large number of ordinary workers, and which is of strategic importance to the future of British manufacturing? Clearly if there were a will there would be a way. Unfortunately this government is only interested in short-term policies that protect the well-off and reduce the role of the state. Fred Rogers Sparkford, Somerset \u2022 Although the UK has moved forward in the relationship between business and the union movement (unlike my home country Australia) there is still this belief that we can work in a global marketplace and continue with our workplace conditions and pay. When will we realise that we can\u2019t compete in manufacturing with the likes of China, because we all want to buy or goods at home for the cheapest price? So governments/unions need to decide whether to continue in the global marketplace and import cheaper goods than manufactured at home, or to tax imports at a rate that provides an equal selling price to those we manufacture. Phil Wallbank Hobart, Australia \u2022 Your paper is right to make the case for an active industrial policy (Editorial, 31 March). The challenges facing Tata Steel show the importance of an industrial strategy to both companies and workers. Many comparable countries are already taking steps to support industry. The US has been quietly subsidising and protecting manufacturing industries, including car production. But this is not just a rich country problem. Industrial policies are equally \u2013 if not more \u2013 important for poorer countries. Yet the terms of many global trade deals and World Trade Organisation rules stop developing country governments from supporting their emerging industries. Decision-makers and opinion formers calling for the support of UK industry should be equally open to making the case for developing countries searching for a sustainable route out of poverty.

It&#xa0;seems our steel is being sacrificed on the atomic altar of keeping China sweet over its investment in the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, confidence in which is eroding even in France (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/30/edf-board-member-hinkley-point-c-project-postponed\" title=\"\">Member of EDF board urges power plant delay</a>, 31 March).</p> <p>British engagement with China over nuclear power dates back to the autumn of 2013, when chancellor George Osborne visited Beijing <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013-10/16/content_17035049.htm\" title=\"\">to seek investment in the Hinkley C project from the Chinese government</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/25/george-osborne-presses-on-with-hinkley-power-station-despite-criticism\" title=\"\">was finalised last September</a>.</p> <p>The trade unionists now rightly defending their jobs and the steel industry should have words with the leadership of the Unite union, who are even more gung-ho for Hinkley C to go ahead than Conservative ministers, and point out they are not prepared to sacrifice their livelihoods for this astronomically expensive atomic white elephant, just to keep the Chinese on side.<br><strong>Dr David Lowry</strong><br><em>Senior research fellow, Institute for Resource and Security Studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA</em></p> <p>\u2022 Nils Pratley comments (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/30/who-is-to-blame-for-the-steel-crisis-tata-port-talbot\" title=\"\">Analysis</a>, 31 March) that the UK government cannot be blamed directly for foot-dragging in Brussels over the application of import tariffs to dumped Chinese steel. The time being taken to settle this issue is not the only concern. You reported a couple of weeks ago that the UK government was lobbying for the lowest possible tariff to be set; a mere 16% or so, which would doubtless be shrugged off by China (compare the US\u2019s 266%). If this is indeed the government\u2019s position, it deserves to be widely known, as undermining its feeble pleas that it is doing \u201ceverything it can\u201d to&#xa0;preserve a UK steel industry. <br><strong>Valerie Bayliss</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 When the banking industry was close to collapse eight years ago, banks were nationalised speedily and with the full support of Conservative MPs including David Cameron. This saved many jobs. It secured the future of the industry and that of many who benefit from it.</p> <p>Today the steel industry faces a similar existential threat but Cameron says nationalisation is not the answer. Can anyone explain to me why our steel industry today deserves less prompt and effective action than our banking industry did then?<br><strong>Nigel Lindsay</strong><br><em>Bo\u2019ness, West Lothian</em></p> <p>\u2022 Comforting to know that at least we\u2019ll have Trident even if we can\u2019t even roll a sheet of steel any more.<br><strong>Martin Jeeves</strong><br><em>(Ex-Steel Company of Wales, Port Talbot, 1967), Cardiff</em></p> <p>\u2022 Tata corporation \u2013 Indian global conglomerate \u2013 is closing Port Talbot steelworks. No great surprise since these global businesses are only interested in making money; no interest at all in maintaining employment in any particular country. Port Talbot is said to be losing \u00a31m a day. Reasons given are cheap Chinese imports, high energy costs \u2013 some 50% higher than in France and Germany \u2013 and high business rates. All of these are to some extent a consequence of government policy or neglect. Conservative governments are not interested in protecting heavy industry that employs very large numbers of ordinary workers and where unions are potentially strong; look at what happened to coal mining, shipbuilding, British owned car manufacturing, etc. The present government is dependent on French and, it hopes, Chinese money to finance Hinkley Point nuclear construction and for many infrastructure projects, so it doesn\u2019t want to annoy the Chinese by doing anything about their \u201cdumping\u201d of cheap steel.</p> <p>The government also argues that, even if it wanted to, it cannot use taxpayers\u2019 money to save Port Talbot because of EU restrictions on state aid; curious how the EU is apparently to blame. How is it possible therefore for Germany, France and Italy to have state involvement in so much of their manufacturing industries? Thousands of millions of pounds, were used without question to rescue banks from the mess they had created. Why then cannot smaller sums be used to rescue a heavy industry whose problems are not of its own making, which employs a large number of ordinary workers, and which is of strategic importance to the future of British manufacturing? Clearly if there were a will there would be a way. Unfortunately this government is only interested in short-term policies that protect the well-off and reduce the role of the state.<br><strong>Fred Rogers</strong><br><em>Sparkford, Somerset</em></p> <p>\u2022 Although the UK has moved forward in the relationship between business and the union movement (unlike my home country Australia) there is still this belief that we can work in a global marketplace and continue with our workplace conditions and pay.</p> <p>When will we realise that we can\u2019t compete in manufacturing with the likes of China, because we all want to buy or goods at home for the cheapest price?</p> <p>So governments/unions need to decide whether to continue in the global marketplace and import cheaper goods than manufactured at home, or to tax imports at a rate that provides an equal selling price to those we manufacture.<br><strong>Phil Wallbank</strong><br><em>Hobart, Australia</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your paper is right to make the case for an active industrial policy (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/30/the-guardian-view-on-tata-steels-pull-out-a-national-summons-to-get-serious\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 31 March). The challenges facing Tata Steel show the importance of an industrial strategy to both companies and workers. Many comparable countries are already taking steps to support industry. The US has been quietly subsidising and protecting manufacturing industries, including car production. &#xa0;</p> <p>But this is not just a rich country problem. Industrial policies are equally \u2013 if not more \u2013 important for poorer countries. Yet the terms of many global trade deals and World Trade Organisation rules stop developing country governments from supporting their emerging industries. Decision-makers and opinion formers calling for the support of UK industry should be equally open to making the case for developing countries searching for a sustainable route out of poverty.<br><strong>Lila Caballero</strong><br><em>Policy adviser, ActionAid</em></p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

The Conservatives are in power and have to decide whether to let the company sink or swim. A choice is made: public ownership. David Cameron taking the plunge and announcing the nationalisation of Tata Steel\u2019s UK holdings? No, this was Ted Heath in 1971, when Whitehall stepped in after Rolls-Royce went into receivership. The nationalisation of Rolls-Royce counters the argument that state rescues are always about bailing out \u201clame ducks\u201d. Heath took a gamble that the company had failed due to the unexpectedly high costs of developing a new, advanced RB211 jet engine but had a long-term future. Rolls-Royce came through its temporary difficulties and became one of Britain\u2019s few genuinely world-class companies. After 16 years under public ownership, it was privatised by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government in 1987. Not all the state interventions were so successful, with the result that the phrase \u201c1970s-style bailout\u201d has become shorthand for throwing good money after bad. Cameron clearly doesn\u2019t fancy following the Heath approach when it comes to steel. The prime minister has made it clear that while the government is not ruling anything out, he does not see nationalisation as the right answer. That\u2019s because not all the state interventions in the 1970s proved to be as successful as Rolls-Royce. The peak period for intervention were between 1971 and 1977, straddling administrations headed by Heath, and Labour\u2019s Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan. By the time he left office in 1974, Heath had nationalised or provided state support for air engines, the British motorcycle industry and Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. British Leyland was taken into public ownership by Wilson while Callaghan was prime minister when the aerospace and shipbuilding sectors were nationalised in 1977. The failure of nationalisation to turn around the fortunes of British Leyland was a turning point. Thereafter, it was seen as the classic basket case, only kept alive by large and repeated injections of taxpayers\u2019 money. For years afterwards, those advocating nationalisation or even an activist industrial strategy were met with a one-word rejoinder by their opponents: Leyland. Conservative governments of the 1980s and 1990s preferred privatisation to nationalisation, while the Labour governments headed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown did everything in their power to avoid anything that smacked of a return to the 1970s. When, for instance, the government took control of Railtrack in 2002 in the wake of the Hatfield crash, it was at pains to point out that the successor company, Network Rail, was a not-for-profit business underwritten by the Treasury rather than a nationalised entity. Similarly, when Northern Rock was on the brink in the autumn of 2007, Alistair Darling\u2019s instinct was to look for a buyer and it was only after six months, and with great reluctance, that he opted for nationalisation. When Darling\u2019s Treasury took big stakes in RBS and Lloyds Banking Group in late 2008, it was because the government felt it had no alternative. Full nationalisation was spurned, Whitehall took a hands-off approach and it was made clear that the intention was to return the banks to the private sector as soon as possible. The bailout saved the banks, just as the financial help provided by George Bush and Barack Obama saved the US auto industry. Rolls-Royce is evidence that nationalisation can work; Railtrack that private ownership is not always the right option. However, it is telling that Labour is only calling for the temporary nationalisation of Tata\u2019s UK plants while another buyer is found, not permanent state ownership. The 1970s still cast a long shadow.",

      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline is taking action to make medicines more affordable in developing countries, including waiving patent protection for new drugs in the world\u2019s poorest nations. Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker said it would not file patents for new medicines in the poorest countries, such as Afghanistan, Rwanda and Cambodia, allowing cheaper generic versions to come on the market without the threat of legal action. GSK\u2019s chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, said the company was already doing this in some countries, but wanted to streamline its approach to \u201crecognise the realities of the world\u201d. He said the move would have little effect on the group\u2019s profits. In lower middle income countries such as Kosovo, Pakistan, Morocco and Ukraine, the drugmaker will offer licences to generic drugmakers for 10 years, in return for a small royalty on sales. The measures will affect 85 countries, helping more than 2 billion people, and benefit Africa most, according to GSK. Any GSK medicines on the World Health Organisation\u2019s list of essential medicines will be automatically included. Rohit Malpani, director of policy and advocacy at M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, gave a muted response. He noted that the world\u2019s poorest countries were already exempt from patent protection rules until 2033 under a World Trade Organisation agreement, and added that it did not make commercial sense for the pharmaceutical industry to seek patents in many other developing countries. He said GSK\u2019s move excluded generic drug producing countries such as India, Brazil and China, as well as many other middle income countries that are struggling to pay for medicines. He argued that it was not clear how it would work in practice, and that it should be up to governments, not companies, to make such decisions. Speaking from New York before a UN panel meeting on access to medicines, Witty said GSK would adopt a \u201ccustomised approach\u201d as standards of living rise in developing countries. He pointed to India, where other pharmaceutical companies have been embroiled in patent disputes with local generic firms. GSK has sought to avoid such disputes by filing only a handful of patents and adopting \u201cIndian-style pricing\u201d starting at five rupees for Calpol and ulcer drug Zinetac. Witty said the new tiered model on intellectual property was analogous to GSK\u2019s pricing on vaccines. However, the company, along with US group Pfizer, has come under fire from MSF, which has criticised high prices for new vaccines and called on the firms to reduce the price of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to $5 a child in developing countries. The move will be seen as an attempt by Witty to seal his legacy before he stands down from his post next year. Under his leadership, GSK has cut the prices of HIV and other drugs in developing countries. He has also led the way on opening access to clinical research and stopped controversial sales practices, after a corruption scandal in China in 2013 for which the company was fined \u00a3300m. The rest of the industry has also been moving towards tiered pricing for poorer countries, in response to criticism that many new drugs are too expensive for the developing world. GSK also plans to commit its future cancer therapies \u2013 it has about a dozen in development after selling a portfolio to Novartis \u2013 to the Medicines Patent Pool. This is a UN-backed initiative through which pharmaceutical companies have been granting licences to generic drugmakers in the developing world to make cheaper drugs for HIV, hepatitis C and tuberculosis. Witty said there was a growing need for affordable cancer treatments in developing countries. Prof Raymond Hill, visiting professor at Imperial College London, welcomed the move as a \u201cbrave and positive step\u201d that sets a \u201cprecedent for other major multinational pharma companies to follow\u201d. He added: \u201cThe impact of this move on the treatment of cancer and other diseases in each individual country will depend on whether there is a local adequate healthcare infrastructure that will allow the safe use of powerful new drugs.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Prudential\u2019s former chief executive was paid \u00a35m for the last five months in the job, before he headed to Credit Suisse and received a further \u00a313.7m in 2015 \u2013 despite requesting a 40% bonus cut at the investment bank. Tidjane Thiam, who left the Pru on 31 May last year and joined the Swiss bank as chief executive in July, made nearly \u00a350m in his six years at the British insurer. Prudential\u2019s annual report (pdf) shows that he was paid a salary of \u00a3455,000, pension benefits of \u00a3114,000 and a bonus of \u00a3704,000 for the last five months he was on the insurer\u2019s board. In addition, he received \u00a33.7m of share awards under a long-term incentive scheme, which took his total package to \u00a35m. The previous year, the company awarded him a pay and shares package of \u00a313.4m. The annual report also showed that Thiam made \u00a348m in total in the six years he was at the helm at Prudential. In February Thiam sought to quash a row over his Credit Suisse pay by asking for his bonus to be cut. However, the company\u2019s 2015 annual report published earlier this month revealed that he still received \u00a313.7m in cash and share awards last year, even with a 40% bonus reduction. The Pru\u2019s new chief executive, Mike Wells, who took over from Thiam in June, received a total pay package of just over \u00a310m last year including a \u00a33.2m bonus. This was less than the \u00a312.4m he made in 2014, however, when he ran the US division. Three other unidentified employees received at least \u00a38.7m, \u00a38m and \u00a35.6m respectively, the report showed. Bond veteran Richard Woolnough, one of Prudential\u2019s fund managers, is thought to have scooped \u00a332m for 2013 and 2014. A company spokesman said that management had been hitting its targets. Prudential beat City forecasts with a 22% rise in annual profits to \u00a34bn last month, prompting it to raise its 2015 dividend by 5% to 38.78p a share and to declare a special dividend of 10p. However, its investment arm M&amp;G suffered fund outflows of 7% to \u00a3246bn last year, as retail investors pulled nearly \u00a311bn of funds during volatile markets. 2015 was another bumper pay year for the insurer\u2019s executive directors, who were paid a combined \u00a340.7m, though this was down from \u00a353.3m in 2014. Barry Stowe, who took over from Wells as head of the north American arm, earned \u00a36.8m; Michael McLintock, who runs M&amp;G, made \u00a35.4m; chief financial officer Nic Nicandrou pocketed \u00a34.5m, Jackie Hunt, who ran Prudential\u2019s UK and Europe division until October, earned \u00a33.7m; and Asia chief Tony Wilkey was paid \u00a33.4m. Explaining the company\u2019s pay awards, Anthony Nightingale, who chairs the remuneration committee, said: \u201cThe strong performance of the group has been sustained over a number of years, notwithstanding the external challenges faced by the group during this time.\u201d He noted that Prudential had delivered combined operating profits of \u00a310bn for 2013, 2014 and 2015, \u201cexceeding the stretching targets established by the committee\u201d. He added: \u201cThis impressive financial performance has translated into significant returns to the company\u2019s shareholders, with \u00a3100 invested in Prudential on 1 January 2013 being worth \u00a3189 on 31 December 2015 through the combined effect of dividends paid and increases in the share price.\u201d Figures from the European Banking Authority showed this week that the UK \u2013 with Europe\u2019s biggest financial centre in London \u2013 had more than three times as many high-earning bankers as the rest of the EU combined.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron is now flying to Washington for a world leader\u2019s meeting on nuclear security, so there\u2019s unlikely to be a major breakthrough in the steel crisis today. And by the time Cameron gets there, more than 115,000 people will have signed the petition urging him to recall parliament. So let\u2019s quickly recap: An emergency meeting at Downing Street to discuss the steel crisis has not yielded any obvious progress. After discussing the situation with ministers, the prime minister emerged to tell reporters that the UK faces \u201ca difficult situation\u201d with \u201cno guarantee of success\u201d. Although Cameron said all options were open, he appeared to reject the idea of taking the steel industry into public hands. As he put it: \u201cWe are not ruling anything out. I don\u2019t believe nationalisation is the right answer, what we want to do is secure a long-term future for Port Talbot and for other steel plants in the UK.\u201d The opposition Labour party, which has proved more awake to the steel crisis than the government, criticised Cameron again today. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government should have taken immediate action to support Tata UK\u2019s operations. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is pushing a four-part plan, which would begin with the temporary nationalisation of the industry to protect tens of thousands of jobs. McDonnell also wants the procurement rules shaken up, so that more British steel is used for infrastructure Port Talbot\u2019s MP, Stephen Kinnock, has accused the government of shambolic handling of the crisis. He\u2019s also written for the Guardian about how Britain has actually blocked efforts to prevent Chinese steel dumping. The Unite union is also pushing for the government to take the sector into public hands, warning that the whole of British industry will suffer if steel fails. And business secretary Sajid Javid is yet to return to the UK from Australia, having ended his trip early on Wednesday. He\u2019s hoping to be in Port Talbot on Friday..... Jeremy Corbyn has criticised David Cameron for failing to achieve more at his emergency meeting on the steel crisis. Rather than simply talking, the PM should be taking measures right now to stability the sector, argues the Labour leader (who scraped his own holiday yesterday to visit Port Talbot) \u201cThe Prime Minister has offered no solutions today to the threat to our steel industry. His government is failing thousands of Tata steelworkers whose jobs are on the line. It\u2019s not good enough for David Cameron to stand by and say the situation is difficult. He should listen to over 100,000 people who\u2019ve already signed the petition calling for parliament to be recalled to debate this crisis. He must act now to protect the heart of manufacturing industry and take a public stake in steel.\u201d Labour MP Stephen Kinnock has hit out at Brexit campaigners who blame Europe for the steel crisis. Kinnock, whose constituency includes the Port Talbot steel works, says David Cameron is at fault for championing China\u2019s interests, not those of British steel workers. Writing for the Guardian, he says: The reality is that the European commission has been trying to tackle the steel crisis for years now, but has consistently been hamstrung by a British government fighting tooth and nail to undermine those efforts. The government is not only actively working against the commission\u2019s attempts to toughen up its anti-dumping measures, where it has been the ringleader of a backroom campaign against trade defence reform, it is also lobbying hard for China to be granted market economy status (MES). MES would mean the World Trade Organisation would consider China to be a market economy, and we would therefore be unable to impose effective tariffs on dumped steel from the 80%-state-owned Chinese steel industry. Ever since 2010 when the prime minister declared he would \u201cmake the case for China to get market economy status\u201d, he and George Osborne have been Beijing\u2019s chief cheerleaders in Europe. Cameron and Osborne know that the granting of MES would dramatically reduce the European commission\u2019s ability to impose tariffs on dumped Chinese steel. These are not party-political points. These are the views of the steel industry itself. It has repeatedly urged the government to act, and to stop promoting China\u2019s cause in Europe. Here\u2019s the full piece: A spokeswoman at the European Commission has said contacts with the British government on the future of Port Talbot were ongoing. The commission is ready to give targeted advice to the sector and member states to make sure that state aid and EU funding possibilities are fully exploited and that any measures comply with EU law.\u201d \u201cWhile the details of any possible measures are still under discussion in the UK, we are not in a position to provide further comment until the UK Government has taken a decision on the issue.\u201d Europe\u2019s state aid rules could prevent the UK from funding a large rescue package. Back in January, the Commission declared that member states cannot use taxpayers\u2019 funds for \u201cthe rescue and restructuring of companies in difficulty in the steel sector\u201d. Business secretary Sajid Javid\u2019s journey back from Australia is taking longer than hoped. Westminster journalists are reporting that Javid will not be reporting for duty in the steel crisis until tomorrow. Javid had hoped to get back this afternoon, having cancelled his official trip to Australia around 24 hours ago. The Daily Telegraph are reporting that business secretary Sajid Javid took his teenage daughter on his aborted trip to Australia. They say: The Telegraph has learned that he took his teenage daughter with him on the controversial trip and was planning to extend his visit by several days so he could go on a holiday with her. Mr Javid paid for his daughter\u2019s flight himself. A spokesman for Mr Javid said: \u201cWe can confirm that Mr Javid\u2019s daughter accompanied him on his visit to Australia. There was no cost to the taxpayer.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure this wouldn\u2019t breach any government rules. However, it could prove awkward for Javid as he tries to explains a) why he left the UK while Tata was making such a crucial decision, and b) why he didn\u2019t return sooner. We\u2019ve love to hear from people who live in Port Talbot, and the surrounding area in South Wales, on how the crisis is affecting you: Rating agency Moody\u2019s has just declared that Tata will be a little financially stronger once it has shed its UK steelworks, but not enough to move its credit rating. \u201cTata Steel Limited\u2019s planned restructuring of its UK businesses is credit positive as it reduces some of the negative pressure on the company\u2019s operating performance, however it won\u2019t move Tata Steel\u2019s Ba3 rating.\u201d With its massive steel industry, and slowing economy, China is at the heart of the crisis facing British steel. So it\u2019s worrying to hear one of China\u2019s top producers warn that a new Ice Age is gripping the sector. Angang Steel Co said that a \u2018deep winter\u2019 had arrived, after posting a net loss of almost 4.6bn yuan (or \u00a3500m) today. \u201cIn 2015, China experienced a slowdown in economic growth and excess steel capacity, which caused the domestic and overseas steel industry to enter into an \u2018Ice Age\u2019\u201d. Bloomberg has more details: Steel Industry Facing `Ice Age,\u2019 Top China Mill Warns That slowdown in the Chinese economy has encouraged producers to ship excess steel overseas \u2013 particularly to countries like Britain where trade tariffs are low. And more could be heading our way. China\u2019s largest producer, Baosteel, has revealed it will boost output by 20% this year. Sky\u2019s Ed Conway has dug up a fascinating stat \u2013 China produced more steel in 2013 and 2014 than Britain has made ever. Steel has a vital part in the history of Sheffield. And Professor Sir Keith Burnett, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, argues that the UK government needs to give the industry proper protection. Professor Burnett says: \u201cSteel is a core aspect of what we make and how we make it. It generates jobs, and it generates long term national security. Are you always going to buy your systems from elsewhere? No, you need steel.\u201d He also argues that industrial policy must embrace the \u201cnational purpose\u201d, as well as competing with other countries. \u201cWe\u2019re interacting with countries like China that have a strong national purpose and we must maintain ours. Steel is a test for Europe. If you make competition the only touchstone then you let down your citizens and long-term economic stability. More than 100,000 people have now signed the petition calling for MPs to be recalled from the Easter holiday to debate the steel crisis. It was only set up yesterday, by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Hitting 100,000 signatures means that parliament must now consider debating the petition. There\u2019s just one snag - MPs are currently on recess, so they can\u2019t really consider it right now..... Chancellor George Osborne says he\u2019s mentioned the steel crisis to other finance ministers, at today\u2019s meeting in Paris. The chancellor also welcomes today\u2019s revised growth forecasts: The prime minister has also given a short statement to the media following the steel crisis meeting. Looking rather grim-faced, David Cameron says: The situation at Port Talbot is of deep concern. I know how important those jobs are - those jobs are vital to workers\u2019 families, vital to those communities. The government will do everything it can, working with the company, to try and secure the future of steel-making in Port Talbot and across our country. It\u2019s a vital industry. Q: Are you ruling out nationalisation in the long-term? Cameron replies that the government is \u201cnot ruling anything out\u201d, before immediately adding that \u201cI won\u2019t believe nationalisation is the right answer\u201d (which hardly rules it in). Q: In the short-term, are you going to push the European Union on tariffs, as it appears Britain has blocked tariffs that could have prevented steel dumping? I have had \u201cteams of ministers working for months to help this industry\u201d, to ensure we procure steel for our ships and other vital industries, Cameron declares. We\u2019ve cut energy costs of British steel, and with others in Europe we have made sure there are proper penalties for those who dump steel. But this industry is in difficulty right across the world. There\u2019s been a collapse in prices, and massive over-capacity. We had been concerned Port Talbot could have closed outright, which is why we worked very hard with the company to ensure there will be a proper sales process. But Cameron then warned: This is a difficult situation. There\u2019s no guarantee of success. Q: Why has the government been behind the curve on this issue? Cameron repeats his line about \u2018teams of ministers\u2019 working on the issue, which has ensured there will be a sales process rather than outright closure. And the prime minister also argues that the steel crisis is a reason to remain in Europe, rather than leave. It is \u201cvital\u201d that European markets are open to us, rather than UK steelmakers facing tariffs of their own. And he concludes by warning that this is \u201ca difficult situation. There can be no guarantee of success given the problems the steel industry faces worldwide\u201d. David Cameron is tweeting about the steel crisis, following today\u2019s emergency meeting with ministers. Newsflash from Downing Street: The Government is \u201cdoing everything it can\u201d to resolve the steel crisis but nationalisation is not the right answer, David Cameron has said. More on that shortly.... Metal processing company Liberty House have reportedly said they might be interested in some of Tata\u2019s UK assets. According to Sky News, Liberty sees some value in Tata\u2019s \u2018rolling\u2019 operations \u2013 which recycle steel. However, Liberty is apparently not interested in Tata\u2019s blast furnaces (at Port Talbot and Scunthorpe), in the current economic climate. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s economy grew faster than previously thought in the last quarter of 2015. UK GDP rose by 0.6% in October-December, according to the Office for National Statistics, not 0.5% as earlier estimated. The dominant service sector led the way, with growth of 0.8%. Industrial production shrank by 0.4%, with manufacturers only managing to expand by 0.1%. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has been outlining a four-point plan to save the UK steel industry. This plan has \u201cemerged from discussions within the industry\u201d, if an immediate buyer can\u2019t be found. And it includes taking the steel industry under public ownership. Here\u2019s the details: Nationalise, to stabilise the steel industry. Back the recovery plan put forward by the workforce Look to see what government assistance can be provided. This month\u2019s Budget failed to include any support on business rates, which are five-to-seven times higher in the UK. Look at public procurement [to buy more British steel for state infrastructure projects. McDonnell tells Sky News: On that four-point plan, we think there is a future for the steel industry and that we can protect the jobs and the local community. He also urges David Cameron to consider recalling parliament, so there can be a \u201cproper debate\u201d next week. MPs across the country want to know what the government\u2019s plan is, and we need to debate it thoroughly. And on Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme, McDonnell says that Labour could fund a recovery in the UK steel industry by reversing the corporation and capital gains tax cuts announced in this month\u2019s budget. The Steel crisis emergency meeting is underway now, as David Cameron tries to get to grips with the crisis. Several ministers have been spotted arriving at Number 10 this morning, including small business minister Anna Soubry, work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb. According to Sky News, Welsh secretary Alun Cairns had to run up Downing Street to avoid being late. Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey then urges David Cameron to recall parliament to discuss the crisis, and set up a steel taskforce. Q: Should we follow Scotland\u2019s example and take temporary control of the steel industry? Yes, McCluskey replies. The Scottish government sent a message that they take the crisis seriously* [* - by buying two steel works, and then quickly selling them onto a metals company called Liberty House] Len McCluskey, head of the Unite union, is on the Today Programme now to discuss the steel crisis. Q: Is there a direct analogy between what we did for the banks after the financial crisis, and what we could do for steel now? Absolutely, McCluskey replies. The National Audit Office says we put one thousand billion pounds of taxpayers money into the banks to secure their survival, because the government felt they were so important to the economy. That\u2019s precisely what we should do now for steel. We are appealing to David Cameron to take \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d and recall parliament. This is an industrial crisis of \u201cenormous proportions\u201d, McKluskey continues. It doesn\u2019t just affect 40,000 workers, it affects our entire manufacturing base. It\u2019s absolutely essential that a foundation industry like steel is protected in order that we can have the much-vaunted march of the makers that the government talks about. Q: But we couldn\u2019t have functioned as a country without the banks. We can buy steel from 60 countries around the world, and it\u2019s available cheaply. We don\u2019t need a steel industry of its current size. That\u2019s terribly short-sighted, says McCluskey. Industries such as automotive, aerospace, defence, engineering, all require steel..... Q: And they can buy it cheaply ...That\u2019s low-quality Chinese steel that most countries won\u2019t take. Unfortunately Britain allows it in. Other European countries protect their steel industry - Germany makes four times as much steel as the UK. And if we don\u2019t have our own steel industry, it will cause serious knock-on effects to the rest of the economy. Q: But if we support steel, taxpayers will have to pay \u00a31m per day... to support an industry of [just] 40,000 people. Millions of people work in manufacturing... that sector is already stuttering along, McCluskey says. It will suffer further if the steel industry dies. Q: But cheap steel is a good thing for many UK industries. There are different qualities of steel. We just used Swedish steel to build Royal Navy ships - that\u2019s ludicrous. The government should use its procurement powers to ensure British steel is used for these projects. Speaking of shambles....it appears that business secretary Sajid Javid won\u2019t be back in London until this afternoon (or later) to tackle the crisis despite cutting his trip to Australia short yesterday. The Times has the details: The business secretary had boarded a flight to Australia, where he was meeting Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, hours before a board meeting at Tata\u2019s headquarters in Mumbai to decide the future of its British steel operation. He touched down during the Tata meeting on Tuesday evening. Aides claim that they gave \u201cserious consideration\u201d to aborting the trip but he decided to continue because no firm decision had been made. Less than 24 hours later he decided to head home but missed the last flight and spent another night in Sydney. He will be back by mid-afternoon today at the earliest. It also emerged that ten civil servants from the business department were attending a \u201cresilience\u201d training course at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art yesterday. More here: Chaotic steel crisis response puts 40,000 jobs at risk Javid did at least attend a black tie dinner, before heading back to the airport. Stephen Kinnock also concedes that full-scale nationalisation of Tata UK could be \u2018very difficult\u2019. But the government must \u201cstep up to the place\u201d and make it clear that it will support the steelworks until a buyer is found, and give people a sense of hope. Stephen Kinnock, Labour MP for the South Wales constituency of Aberavon, is discussing the steel crisis now on Sky News. Kinnock says he \u201cflabbergasted by the incompetence\u201d shown by the government over the crisis. He says: It\u2019s a total shambles, and it\u2019s been a shambles for years. Steel industry has been facing problems for five or six years, Kinnock continues, including dumping of Chinese steel, expensive energy, not enough action on public procurement. It\u2019s absolutely extraordinary that they\u2019ve been asleep at the wheel for this long. Kinnock\u2019s constituency includes the Port Talbot steel works, so he flew to Mumbai with union leaders this week to lobby the Tata board before it took its decision. He\u2019s disappointed that business secretary Sajid Javid wasn\u2019t there too, as the government knew that 29 March was \u201cD-Day for Tata Steel\u201d. A plan should have been put in place to provide Tata the help it needs, and squared with the European Commission to avoid state aid problems. Instead, Kinnock concludes, David Cameron is behaving as if he didn\u2019t see this crisis coming. They\u2019re in total disarray. They either don\u2019t care or they\u2019re so incompetent that they simply don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. Today\u2019s front page headlines make uncomfortable reading for David Cameron. The Mirror accuse the PM of betraying Britain\u2019s steel workers: The Guardian reports Labour accusing the government of being in disarray: The Financial Times says Cameron faces \u201cacute political difficulty\u201d over the crisis: While Metro says Cameron\u2019s decision to chair today\u2019s meeting could be \u2018too little, too late\u2019: Good morning. David Cameron\u2019s hopes of a quiet Easter break have been shattered by the crisis gripping Britain\u2019s steel industry. Having dashed back from his family holiday in Lanzarote, the prime minister will chair an emergency meeting in Downing Street on the issue. Top of the agenda: How to save 15,000 jobs at Tata UK\u2019s steel operations, which are now up for sale, plus another 25,000 workers in associated industries. What can the PM do? Ideally, the government wants to keep the steel mills running while a buyer is found. But with Tata UK\u2019s losing \u00a31m per day, that\u2019s a difficult option - even though the Indian conglomerate is prepared to \u2018give it away for nothing\u2019, we hear. Temporary public ownership has been mooted, to help protect workers until the business is in new hands. Union leaders are pushing for full-scale nationalisation to be considered, but business secretary Sajid Javid has already signalled that it\u2019s not an option. So, quite a mess, with industry insiders warning that there are just a few weeks to find a solution. Cameron is also playing political catch-up. Tata\u2019s decision to sell up seems to have come as a shock to the government, forcing Sajid Javid to scramble back from Australia yesterday. This left the stage clear for Labour; with Jeremy Corbyn telling Port Talbot workers last night that the PM must take immediate steps to guarantee steel\u2019s future. Corbyn is also pushing for parliament to be recalled to discuss the crisis. Downing Street is refusing, but a petition set up by the labour leader has now attracted 87,000 signatures. Also coming up today..... A new estimate of UK GDP for the last three months of 2015 is released at 9.30am. That is likely to confirm that Britain remains dependent on its service sector for growth, with manufacturing stuck in recession. Chancellor George Osborne is in Paris for a meeting of G20 finance ministers. And Bank of England governor Mark Carney is speaking in Toyko, at a session on financial stability. Maybe he\u2019ll have some views on the steel crisis.... We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Up to 40,000 jobs are at risk after Tata Steel revealed that it plans to pull out of the UK. This has left the Port Talbot plant, the UK\u2019s biggest steelworks, and Tata\u2019s other sites facing a race against time to secure their survival. Those sites employ a total of 15,000 people, and a further 25,000 livelihoods are under threat in the supply chain if the business collapses. Jeremy Corbyn has accused the government of being in \u201cdisarray\u201d over the crisis and called for the company to be nationalised. With just weeks to find a solution, these are the potential options for the government and the future of Tata Steel. Nationalisation The Labour leader says that because steel is a strategic asset, Tata\u2019s UK business should be nationalised in order to safeguard its future \u2013 just as it was in its previous incarnation as British Steel. However, David Cameron and Sajid Javid, the business secretary, have played down the prospect of nationalising Port Talbot or the entire Tata UK business. Government officials have warned that taking over the company could carry a price tag of \u00a31.5bn a year. Cameron said: \u201cWe are not ruling anything out. I don\u2019t believe nationalisation is the right answer, what we want to do is secure a long-term future for Port Talbot and for other steel plants in the UK.\u201d In addition to the government\u2019s concerns, nationalisation could fall foul of European Union state-aid rules. Encourage Tata to keep its UK steel business The three major problems that have led to Tata looking to pull out of the UK are energy costs, the impact of China dumping steel in Europe, and its pension burden. Officially, Tata has said it is considering all its options, rather than simply selling the UK business, so this option is in theory still on the table. If the trade unions accept drastic cuts to their pensions and the government slaps higher tariffs on the importing of Chinese steel then this could clear the path for Tata to activate the turnaround plan for Port Talbot and its UK business. However, a source close to the company said the chances of enough being done to persuade Tata to keep its UK steel operations are \u201cvery slim\u201d. Facilitate a private sale through loans or temporary state ownership Two Lanarkshire steel mills were saved from closure earlier in March after Tata sold them to metals group Liberty House in a deal that was brokered by the Scottish government. The transaction saw the Scottish government take temporary ownership of the Clydebridge and Dalzell plants before passing them on to Liberty. The UK and Welsh governments could look for a similar deal on Port Talbot and the rest of Tata\u2019s UK business, but it will be far more complex because the size of the transaction would be much larger. Other options for the government would be to offer loans, loan guarantees or new procurement contracts to a buyer. European state-aid rules mean any loans or loan guarantees would have to be on terms similar to those on offer in the commercial world. However, Tata could also offer financial support. In fact, it might have to. Pensions experts believe the Pensions Regulator could push Tata to inject more than \u00a32bn into the British Steel Pension Scheme, which has liabilities of almost \u00a315bn and 130,000 members, making it one of the biggest pension schemes in the UK. Facilitate a breakup of Tata\u2019s UK business The most likely option. Tata has more than a dozen sites in the UK, ranging from quarries in Cumbria to the blast furnace in Port Talbot. Finding a buyer for the whole lot is unlikely. Indeed, Tata sources say it has been trying for the last 18 months to find a buyer but nobody was interested. Liberty, the buyer of Tata\u2019s Scottish assets, has expressed an interest in some of the \u201cdownstream\u201d operations that recycle steel or convert it for specific uses. But there is a major problem with this option \u2013 the part of Tata Steel that is losing the most money and is therefore likely to be the most difficult part to sell is Port Talbot, the site that the government is desperate to save. Port Talbot and its blast furnaces actually produce raw steel from iron ore and coal, but this process is expensive and the most exposed to the impact of rising energy costs and China dumping steel in Europe. Buyers are likely to be thin on the ground. As a result, this option would require the government to either persuade Tata to provide the time to secure deals, temporarily nationalise the parts that take the longest to sell, or simply let parts of the business close. Let Port Talbot and Tata\u2019s entire UK steel business fail The doomsday scenario, which would cost 40,000 jobs according to the IPPR thinktank. Tata Steel UK would fall into administration, with vulture funds and other businesses then buying the assets that take their fancy, with no guarantee they would be used to produce steel. Port Talbot could end up being bought by a property developer who wants to build houses and shops, which is what happened to Rover\u2019s former plant at Longbridge. The pension scheme would have to enter the Pension Protection Fund. Britain would lose its biggest steelmaker and be left with a collection of smaller manufacturers across the country.",

      "bodyText": "Retailers will take the biggest financial hit from the rise in the \u201cnational living wage\u201d (NLW) as more than 300,000 workers get a pay rise from Friday 1 April. The sector will have to find up to \u00a33bn more a year to pay staff by 2020 assuming it maintains differentials between entry and mid-level staff and spreads the NLW rate to all employees, not just the over-25s they are legally obliged to cover, according to the British Retail Consortium. Analysis by the Low Pay Commission (LPC) reveals that retail accounts for just over a fifth of workers over 16 on the minimum wage at present and, together with the hospitality industry, accounts for nearly half of all workers on the lowest pay. Hospitality, which includes hotels, restaurants and bars, is currently the biggest minimum wage employer with 353,000 staff over 16 earning \u00a36.70 an hour \u2013 a quarter of the total. Retailers employ 300,000 according to the LPC, or 21.4% of the total. But many in retail are being paid close to the current minimum so that once the national living wage is introduced retailers will be the biggest minimum wage employer \u2013 with 511,000 staff over 16 \u2013 or 23% of the total on the \u00a37.20 an hour rate. While the sector\u2019s wage bill will increase by only 1.5% by 2020 \u2013 well below the 3.5% rise for cleaners according to the LPC \u2013 the size of the retail industry means the financial hit will be greatest. The pay rises are good news for many on the lowest wages. Already there are signs that the impending arrival of the national living wage has set off a competitive drive for higher salaries, particularly among the major grocers. A high profile campaign by workers rights activists who criticised a string of major retailers for under-paying staff, so that they were reliant on support from benefits such as the working tax credit, also added to the pressure. After Lidl lifted wages to \u00a38.20 an hour, in line with the independently verified living wage at the time, Morrisons and Aldi also bumped up pay for their workers to a similar level. Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, the Co-op and Amazon also upped wages significantly last year. Most major retailers have also opted to spread wage rises right across their workforce, including under-25s who are not covered by the new national living wage rate. But the increases in basic pay have often been accompanied by a squeeze on benefits such as extra pay for Sundays and bank holidays, an end to paid breaks or a squeeze on overtime. B&amp;Q, for example, is the subject of an online petition against its plan to cut Sunday pay and reduce bank holiday rates for some workers in return for lifting minimum wages. Major retailers say the changes are necessary as they are face a \u201clethal cocktail\u201d of cost increases from higher business rates, the apprenticeship levy \u2013 which comes into force next year \u2013 and the national living wage. Smaller independent retailers say the new wage rates will hit them disproportionately. James Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said: \u201cThe introduction of the national living wage will have a devastating impact on many of the 51,000 convenience stores in our sector. \u201cOver 60% of stores in the sector will look to reduce the number of staff hours in their business and delay investment plans, while for some already operating on the edge of profitability it will mean that they will have to either stop employing staff or close their business altogether.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Over the years Britain has racked up some monster balance of payments deficits. The UK went spectacularly into the red during the boom of 1973 and again when the economy overheated in 1988. But forget Tony Barber. Forget Nigel Lawson. No chancellor since modern records began in 1948 has presided over as big a shortfall on the nation\u2019s current account as George Osborne in 2015. No question, the current account deficit \u2013 running at 5.2% of national output last year \u2013 is troubling, not just because of its size but because of its deteriorating trend. It is not even as if the economy is growing especially rapidly, as it was in 1973 and 1988. The fact that the deficit stood at 7% of GDP in the final three months of 2015 when annual growth was a modest 2.3% is an indication of the scale of the problem. The current account is made up of three main components. First, there is the UK\u2019s trade in goods and services, where a deficit of \u00a3125bn in goods in 2015 was only partly offset by a surplus of \u00a389bn in services. Britain has not exported more manufactured goods than it imports since the early 1980s and in recent years has no longer been able to use the proceeds from North Sea oil to mask its dismal performance. Second there is what the Office for National Statistics calls primary income. This is the difference between what the UK makes on its investments overseas and the returns that foreigners make on their investments in the UK. These investments are a mixture of long-term investments in businesses and shorter-term speculative punts. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, big surpluses in primary income limited the size of the current account deficit and diverted attention from the chronic trade deficit. That, though, is no longer the case. The deficit on primary income was \u00a335bn last year, only \u00a32bn less than the trade gap. Finally, there is secondary income, which is the money paid by the UK government to the EU and other multilateral organisations such as the UN and the World Bank. As a rich state, the UK tends to pay more into international bodies than it receives in return: the deficit held steady at \u00a325bn last year. This all adds up to a current account deficit of \u00a392bn. It also adds up to an economy that is seriously unbalanced and highly vulnerable. The reason the economy is seriously unbalanced is that Britain has the wrong sort of growth \u2013 too dependent on consumer spending (hence the whopping deficit in goods) and on the services sector (hence the healthy surplus in services). The deficit on primary income suggests there has been too much investment in parts of the world that are barely growing - the eurozone. Foreigners are making more money out of their UK investments than UK nationals are making out of their overseas assets. The reason the economy is highly vulnerable is that there is a cost to running big current account deficits. Foreign investors have to be willing to allow Britain to live beyond its means. Thus far they have been prepared to do so but they could pull the plug at any time.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trading position with the rest of the world has deteriorated sharply with the current account deficit swelling to its widest on record, fanning fears about the sustainability of the economic recovery. News of the ballooning current account shortfall overshadowed figures showing economic growth was stronger than first thought in the fourth quarter. GDP rose 0.6% compared with an earlier estimate of 0.5% and 0.4% growth the previous quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Experts warned that even that brighter headline figure masked an unbalanced economy with consumer spending being relied on while industry contracted and business investment dropped sharply. At the same time household incomes were shown to have fallen in real terms, casting doubt over how much longer consumers could keep up their pace of spending. It was the figures showing a sharp rise in Britain\u2019s current account that grabbed the most attention and fuelled the debate around the UK\u2019s economic prospects should it opt to leave the EU. The current account deficit reflects Britain\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world and the shortfall between money paid out by the UK and money coming in. It swelled to \u00a332.7bn in the fourth quarter, equivalent to 7% of GDP, up from 4.3% in the third quarter. This was the highest since quarterly records began in 1955. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the deficit to widen to \u00a321.1bn. For 2015 as a whole, the current account deficit hit \u00a396.2bn or 5.2% of GDP, the widest since records began in 1948. The Bank of England has highlighted that the UK relies on foreign investors to fund the shortfall on its balance of payments and has expressed concern that in the event of a vote to leave the EU in June\u2019s referendum foreign investors will become more nervous about buying, or holding, UK assets. Chancellor George Osborne, who is campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, welcomed the growth upgrade: \u201cThe UK is not immune to risks in the global economy as slowing global growth weighs on our outlook. Today\u2019s figures expose the real danger of economic uncertainty and shows that now is precisely not the time to put our economic security at risk by leaving the EU.\u201d Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight said the widening current account deficit could become an increasing problem if financial markets lose confidence in the UK economy for any reason. \u201cThis would make it harder for the UK to attract the investment inflows that it needs to finance the current account deficit and could weigh heavily down on sterling.\u201d He added: \u201cAn obvious potential trigger for the markets losing confidence in the UK economy could be a vote to leave the EU in the 23 June referendum.\u201d The widening in the overall current account shortfall came as Britain\u2019s trade deficit worsened and as the deficit on investment income also widened. As exports fell in the final quarter of 2015 but imports increased, the trade deficit grew to \u00a312.2bn from \u00a38.9bn in the previous quarter. The bigger factor, was the deterioration in the so-called primary income deficit. That more than doubled to \u00a313.1bn in the fourth quarter from \u00a35.8bn in the third quarter, mostly on the back of a drop in receipts from direct investment and portfolio investment abroad. At the same time, there was an increase in payments to foreign direct investors. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank explained: \u201cIn other words, dividend payments to overseas investors into UK assets have far outweighed the investment income that UK investors have earned on their investments overseas.\u201d \u201cThe problem is that the UK economy is outperforming its neighbours (a nice problem to have). The UK\u2019s main trading partners have not grown as fast as the UK \u2013 hence the returns on our investments in those markets have suffered. We have invested badly into slow growing markets. By contrast, overseas investors into the UK have done well.\u201d But that picture played down fears over foreign direct investment being hit if the UK leaves the EU, Clarke added. \u201cWhere would you rather invest \u2013 a fast growing economy like the UK or an economy with persistent disappointments in growth?\u201d GDP growth picks up The GDP figures showed the services sector, the largest part of the economy, was now thought to have expanded 0.8% in the final quarter, up from the previous estimate of 0.7%. Construction output was also revised up to 0.3% growth from a previous estimate of a 0.4% contraction. Industrial production fell 0.4%. The upward revision to overall GDP meant that for 2015 as a whole the economy grew 2.3%, faster than the previous estimate published last month of 2.2%.

That more than doubled to \u00a313.1bn in the fourth quarter from \u00a35.8bn in the third quarter, mostly on the back of a drop in receipts from direct investment and portfolio investment abroad. At the same time, there was an increase in payments to foreign direct investors.<br></p> <p>Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank explained: \u201cIn other words, dividend payments to overseas investors into UK assets have far outweighed the investment income that UK investors have earned on their investments overseas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that the UK economy is outperforming its neighbours (a nice problem to have). The UK\u2019s main trading partners have not grown as fast as the UK \u2013 hence the returns on our investments in those markets have suffered. We have invested badly into slow growing markets.

      "bodyText": "Government ministers are meeting to try to tackle the British steel industry crisis, following Tata Steel\u2019s move to sell off all of its UK operation. David Cameron says he is \u201cnot ruling anything out\u201d \u2013 although he has suggested nationalisation is not the answer. One question keeps being asked. If we spent billions of pounds bailing out the banks, why can\u2019t the state bail out the steel industry? How much was spent bailing out the banks? In 2011, a Reality Check costed the bank bailout at \u00a3124bn in loan or share purchases. Amid all the numbers was the analysis that \u201cthe Royal Bank of Scotland received \u00a345.80bn, Lloyds \u00a320.54bn, Northern Rock a total of \u00a322.99bn, Bradford and Bingley \u00a38.55bn and a further \u00a326.05bn went on \u2018loans to support deposit\u2019.\u201d The details of the bailout are complex, though, and there\u2019s an argument that this figure could legitimately be stated as both higher and lower. The National Audit Office reported that the peak level of support offered to the banks was as high as \u00a3955bn, at one point. As well as the cash to buy into these businesses, the government put \u00a3332.4bn in guarantees and indemnities on the table, to restore confidence in the system. However, the government has also subsequently sold and reprivatised some of the holdings, reclaiming some of the cash. Last year, for example, it sold 5.4% of RBS and now retains less than 11% of Lloyds. The Treasury has also received some fees and interest from the banks, in excess of \u00a311bn. How much would it cost to bail out Tata Steel? Significantly less than the billions spent on the banks. The much-quoted figure has been that the Port Talbot plant is losing \u00a31m a day \u2013 a big bill for the state to suddenly pick up. Sources on Thursday claimed that a bailout could cost as much as \u00a31.5bn a year. The company, which says it values its British steel assets as virtually worthless, claims it would need considerable investment in the UK business to keep it competitive. The state of the global steel market, where plants are only operating at two-thirds capacity and cheap Chinese steel exports are readily available, may render any bailout impractical, regardless of whether or not the money is available. Would EU regulations halt a steel bailout? One frequently mentioned objection to the state buying a stake in the steel industry is that the government would fall foul of EU regulations. State aid is defined as \u201cany advantage granted by public authorities through state resources on a selective basis to any organisations that could potentially distort competition and trade in the European Union\u201d. So why didn\u2019t this apply to the banking sector? Well, there is a get-out clause. The UK government\u2019s own guidance on state aid makes it explicit that \u201csome state aid is beneficial to the economy and supports growth and other policy objectives ... The state aid rules allow for good aid, which is necessary to deliver growth and other important objectives.\u201d The government would argue that preventing the collapse of large chunks of the UK financial services sector was a necessary example of state aid, to mitigate the huge potential impact on the wider economy. The same argument is tougher to make about steel, a smaller sector, despite the devastating impact that closing steelworks would have on local communities. What are the welfare costs of closing Tata steel? This is not a zero-sum game for the UK government. It is going to have to cough up some cash. If it chose not to support the steel industry financially, the taxpayer would foot the bill for supporting the workers laid off if Tata fails to find a buyer. The Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that along with the 15,000 jobs lost directly at Tata, a further 25,000 jobs could go in firms in Tata\u2019s supply chain. Without examining the individual circumstances of each of the 40,000 employees potentially affected it is difficult to estimate the welfare impact. Crudely put, paying the maximum weekly jobseeker\u2019s allowance of \u00a373.10 to all 40,000 of those affected would cost the state \u00a32.9m a week. That would add up to more than \u00a3150m a year. It\u2019s difficult to obtain a precise number. Those under 25 are only entitled to a reduced rate of jobseeker\u2019s allowance of up to \u00a357.90, rather than the full amount of \u00a373.10. And couples, assuming that among that 40,000 there might be some couples who currently work together, can only claim up to \u00a3114.85. Other benefits would be adjusted too \u2013 for example people with children who had been paying the higher tax rate would be able to start claiming child benefit again once unemployed. The amount of housing benefit they can claim to subsidise the rent they are being charged might also change. On the other hand, lower-paid workers in the industry might currently be qualifying for in-work tax credits, which the jobseekers allowance payments would replace. If the government does not directly intervene, it would presumably \u2013 as part of any package of measures \u2013 offer cash for retraining and regeneration of the areas affected by steel plant closures. Whatever the outcome of discussions, the government will have a bill to pay. It just won\u2019t be anywhere near the money spent on the banks.",

The idea of placing plants in public ownership following the financial crisis that led to Tata Steel deciding to sell its British operations was seen as the least viable option during an emergency meeting between the prime minister and his ministers. The idea of part-nationalisation appeared to be under consideration on Wednesday morning, but the Guardian understands that government officials had warned it could carry a price tag of \u00a31.5bn a year. Ideas that are being seriously considered include a cash injection into the industry while a buyer is found. Ministers are also trying to persuade Tata Steel to keep things afloat. But a company source told the Guardian they had already been looking for a buyer for 18 months and were not ready to give the operation away for \u201cnothing\u201d. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the idea of ministers taking nationalisation off the table, as estimates suggested there were up to 40,000 jobs on the line. Speaking after the meeting, Cameron promised the government would do \u201ceverything we can\u201d. \u201cThe situation is of deep concern,\u201d he admitted and there were \u201cno guarantees of success\u201d. He said he knew how important the jobs were \u2013 in Port Talbot and other steel plants across Britain. \u201cWe are not ruling anything out. I don\u2019t believe nationalisation is the right answer, what we want to do is secure a long-term future for Port Talbot and for other steel plants in the UK.\u201d The prime minister said his ministers had been working for months to help the industry, \u201cto make sure that we procure British steel for our ships and for other vital industries in the UK\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve cut the energy costs \u2013 and with others in Europe we\u2019ve made sure that there are proper penalties for those that dump cheap steel on the market. But this industry is in difficulty across the world, there has been a collapse in prices, there is overcapacity, but we are doing everything we can.\u201d His defence of the government followed criticism from some who said ministers had \u201crolled out the red carpet\u201d for Beijing by voting against changes to the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d in Europe, which would allow tougher action on Chinese dumping including higher tariffs. The crisis has triggered a row over whether Britain\u2019s place in the EU has worsened the situation and placed British jobs at risk. Pro-EU supporters point out that other European countries have pushed for higher tariffs and done more to protect their industries, but Brexit campaigners point out how the US has been much more effective at protecting its steel industry. Cameron also tweeted: The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, had called on the government to \u201cget a grip\u201d as Cameron began the emergency discussions. McDonnell reiterated Labour\u2019s call for a temporary nationalisation of the Indian-owned company\u2019s UK plants and said Cameron should swiftly come up with a plan to save jobs, one on which he could get cross-party consensus. \u201cThe prime minister could take a lead in this. The government\u2019s been in a bit of disarray over the last 48 hours,\u201d McDonnell told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, noting that the junior business minister Anna Soubry had hinted at possible nationalisation before the business secretary, Sajid Javid, ruled it out. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of chaos in government and we\u2019re trying to say, look, get a grip now and then come to parliament with a clear plan that hopefully we can back on a cross-party basis,\u201d McDonnell said. Javid was not present at the Downing Street meeting, because he was still travelling back from Australia, while George Osborne was in Paris for a meeting of the G20 finance ministers. Osborne said he had raised the \u201cvital issue of steel\u201d during his meeting. Those present at Cameron\u2019s meeting in London included Soubry, Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, and Stephen Crabb, the work and pensions secretary and former Welsh secretary. Arriving at Downing Street for the meeting, Soubry was asked if the government would let Welsh steel fail. \u201cI hope not,\u201d she replied. Cameron returned from holiday in Lanzarote on Wednesday, while Javid was flying back from Australia after Tata announced it would be selling off British plants including the Port Talbot works in south Wales as well as sites at Rotherham in South Yorkshire, Corby in Northamptonshire and Shotton in Deeside. The company said it was losing \u00a31m a day, with a source claiming that the government\u2019s failure to back calls in Europe for higher tariffs against cheap Chinese imports was the last straw, prompting the decision to sell the business that was once British Steel and more recently Corus. The decision to sell the operation could cost 15,000 jobs inside the company but the thinktank IPPR said that up to 40,000 could be affected more widely across the supply chain. McDonnell said Labour was proposing a four-point plan, comprising temporary nationalisation, restructuring of the business, reduced business rates and the use of British steel in public procurement. Asked whether the billions of pounds in likely spending to achieve this could be justified, McDonnell said that the industry could be made sustainable if it could \u201cweather the storm\u201d it currently faced. \u201cBecause in the long term it will prove cost-effective,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just the cost of losing those jobs. As we\u2019ve seen elsewhere, it\u2019s the cost of devastation of whole communities. Remember, we will be paying out in unemployment and other benefits to those people who lose their jobs. Isn\u2019t it better to keep them in work?\u201d Also speaking on the Today programme, Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite trade union, said there was a comparison to be made with the bailout of the banks amid the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cYes. Undoubtedly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe National Audit Office tells us that we put one thousand billion of British taxpayers\u2019 money into the banks in order to secure their continued survival because the governments of the day thought it was important for the country as a whole and that\u2019s precisely what we should be doing now. \u201cThat\u2019s why we should be appealing to the prime minister to take personal responsibility to recall parliament. This is an industrial crisis of enormous proportions, not just affecting the 40,000 or 50,000 or 60,000 jobs that you mentioned, but it indeed affecting the whole of our manufacturing base. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely essential that a foundation industry like steel is protected in order that we can have the much vaunted \u2018march of the makers\u2019 that the government talks about.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The proposal announced by the prime minister to allow states to raise their own income tax to better fund their education and health expenses is that classic case of a solution that looks great if you think of the world as an economics textbook, but which should be rejected as just a move towards cutting services. When perusing this tax plan, at first you have to try to make sense of just what is the plan, and then it\u2019s best not to be left thinking: \u201cMalcolm, I think that needs a bit more time in the oven. It seems half-baked.\u201d The main gist under Turnbull\u2019s proposal is that the federal government would lower tax rates by a certain amount (say 10%) and the states would be able to raise a \u201csurcharge\u201d of 10%. The federal government would then reduce grants to states by that amount raised in each state. As the Turnbull would have it, no extra spending would occur, and nor would there be extra tax raised \u2013 but in the future states would be able to raise or lower tax rates (and the federal government grants would be lowered ... or possibly raised?). So where is the advantage? Well apparently this measure would mean the states would raise the money and thus would be responsible for it and would be more careful with how they spend it. The premise is based on the idea that vertical fiscal imbalance \u2013 that is, the federal government raises the money and the states spend, leading to bad decisions \u2013 is a terrible thing. It\u2019s a premise that sounds feasible, a bit like saying kids aren\u2019t really responsible for their spending because their parents give them pocket money rather than them going out and earning money. Except state governments already do raise money, do have to produce annual budgets and are awarded credit ratings (Queensland and Western Australia, for example, have had theirs downgraded in the past few years). Essentially those in favour of this idea suggest it will mean state governments are more accountable to voters, because if states can raise or lower taxes they have a better determination over the level of education and health services in their state. In effect: low income tax (voters say yay!); low services (voters say booo!). Thus if a government wanted to improve services without raising income tax it would have to do things more efficiently. But that rests on a premise that there is no incentive already to do that. Clearly there is. As I noted, the states already have budgets, credit ratings and elections. The incentive to deliver health and education as efficiently as possible is there because state governments also spend money on other areas, infrastructure, for one. They also know that if they can somehow deliver services more efficiently they can deliver lower taxes that they already raise, such as payroll tax rates and stamp duties. That the state government would now have an extra source of revenue would not introduce much more of an incentive than already exists. And I\u2019ll leave aside the issue of how inefficient the tax system will become if the federal government changes the tax rates or thresholds but states keep theirs the same. And let\u2019s just also acknowledge that if states are reliant upon income tax it inevitably will force poorer states such as SA and Tasmania to have higher rates or reduce services. The states\u2019 main complaint has been the lack of ability to make local decisions as the grants they get are mostly tied. This was why the SA premier, Jay Weatherill, proposed giving the states a share of income tax revenue in place of the grants. His proposal did not allow for states to raise (or lower) income tax rates, but merely that they would get a set share of income tax, in much the same way they get a share of GST. The allowance for states to raise or lower tax rates introduces a whole new dynamic. It introduces competitive taxation, a recommendation of Tony Abbott\u2019s commission of audit. The belief goes that states could lower taxes to entice people to come to its state, but this would be countered by the need to provide services. Thus once again the belief is that states would again seek to deliver more efficient services in order to lower tax rates to again attract people to their state. By contrast, if a state lowered taxes too greatly and services suffered, people would leave to another state that might have higher taxes but better services. It sounds great if you love economics. The problem is people generally move for one reason: jobs. We know this already. As I noted last year Victoria is experiencing a large net interstate migration boom, while WA is not: Has anyone ever suggested this is happening because WA\u2019s school system or health system is falling behind Victoria\u2019s, or because stamp duty is different in either state? Nope. It\u2019s because the mining boom has ended and Victoria for the first time in a decade has been doing well job-side. Given the costs of moving interstate, the difference in tax rates between the states would have to be massive to make the decision logical. But lack of logic is never much of an issue when it comes to pressure for lowering income tax. And this is the problem with competitive taxation \u2013 it only works if there is also a real \u201ccompetitive federalism\u201d \u2013 that is, competitive services and if the costs of moving between states is essentially nil. I have seen a number of jobs advertised in Sydney that I would love to do, but there is no way I am going to apply for them because the cost of leaving is too great: my wife has a job, my kids love their school and their friends. Were NSW to have a 2% lower tax rate than the ACT, it still wouldn\u2019t matter. The other problem with the story is that there is asymmetrical information. On the revenue side you have a very visible tax rate \u2013 easy to compare, easy to know, and with a lot of pressure on state governments to cut or at least to not raise (as Paul Keating told Tony Blair: \u201cDon\u2019t ever put up income tax, mate ... Do that and they\u2019d rip your fucking guts out.\u201d) On the other side we have schools and hospitals and other healthcare. Do you know if your child\u2019s school is better or worse than that in another state? Is your nearest hospital more efficient than that elsewhere? Sure we have the MySchool website, but really? C\u2019mon, be honest. Unless you are a researcher in those areas you have no idea, and even then the difference in test scores, waiting times, standard of care are hotly debatable and dependent upon various factors such as demographics. No one is moving across the nation because they heard a hospital in Victoria or Adelaide or Sydney or wherever has better service than their nearest. You might do it for a special operation or treatment \u2013 but even then it is only temporary. So what incentive is there for a state to raise taxes to produce better services that is not already there? How good does your state\u2019s healthcare need to be to entice people to move to access it? Or perhaps the more pertinent question: how bad does your service have to get before people will leave? For in reality all the incentive to be competitive is on the revenue side to lower taxes, and there is very little real competition on the expenditure side to improve services other than already exists. This policy thus introduces more incentive to cut revenue, and little incentive to improve services \u2013 the incentive on that side is to cut services and shift them on to the private sector. That\u2019s fine if you think that is a good result, but let\u2019s not pretend this is about improving government service delivery. If you are worried about service delivery, look at service delivery, not at the ability for states to lower taxes. If there is a funding issue for services because of an ageing population, then raise more revenue. Don\u2019t rearrange how the revenue is raised and hope the magic wand of reduced vertical fiscal imbalance will solve the rest.",

      "body": "<p>The proposal announced by the prime minister to allow states to raise their own income tax to better fund their education and health expenses is that classic case of a solution that looks great if you think of the world as an economics textbook, but which should be rejected as just a move towards cutting services.</p> <p>When perusing this tax plan, at first you have to try to make sense of just what <em>is</em> the plan, and then it\u2019s best not to be left thinking: \u201cMalcolm, I think that needs a bit more time in the oven. It seems half-baked.\u201d</p> <p>The main gist under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/31/malcolm-turnbulls-tax-plan-a-distraction-from-tony-abbotts-80bn-cuts\">Turnbull\u2019s proposal</a> is that the federal government would lower tax rates by a certain amount (say 10%) and the states would be able to raise a \u201csurcharge\u201d of 10%. The federal government would then reduce grants to states by that amount raised in each state. </p> <p> As the Turnbull would have it, no extra spending would occur, and nor would there be extra tax raised \u2013 but in the future states would be able to raise or lower tax rates (and the federal government grants would be lowered ... or possibly raised?). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/31/turnbull-offers-states-3bn-for-hospitals-but-plans-to-end-public-schools-support\">Turnbull offers states $3bn for hospitals but plans to end public schools support</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So where is the advantage?</p> <p>Well apparently this measure would mean the states would raise the money and thus would be responsible for it and would be more careful with how they spend it. </p> <p>The premise is based on the idea that vertical fiscal imbalance \u2013 that is, the federal government raises the money and the states spend, leading to bad decisions \u2013 is a terrible thing.</p> <p>It\u2019s a premise that sounds feasible, a bit like saying kids aren\u2019t really responsible for their spending because their parents give them pocket money rather than them going out and earning money. </p> <p>Except state governments already do raise money, do have to produce annual budgets and are awarded credit ratings (Queensland and Western Australia, for example, have had theirs downgraded in the past few years). </p> <p>Essentially those in favour of this idea suggest it will mean state governments are more accountable to voters, because if states can raise or lower taxes they have a better determination over the level of education and health services in their state. In effect: low income tax (voters say yay!); low services (voters say booo!). </p> <p>Thus if a government wanted to improve services without raising income tax it would have to do things more efficiently. </p> <p>But that rests on a premise that there is no incentive already to do that. </p> <p>Clearly there is. </p> <p>As I noted, the states already have budgets, credit ratings and elections. The incentive to deliver health and education as efficiently as possible is there because state governments also spend money on other areas, infrastructure, for one. They also know that if they can somehow deliver services more efficiently they can deliver lower taxes that they already raise, such as payroll tax rates and stamp duties. </p> <p>That the state government would now have an extra source of revenue would not introduce much more of an incentive than already exists.</p> <p>And I\u2019ll leave aside the issue of how inefficient the tax system will become if the federal government changes the tax rates or thresholds but states keep theirs the same. And let\u2019s just also acknowledge that if states are reliant upon income tax it inevitably will force poorer states such as SA and Tasmania to have higher rates or reduce services. </p> <p>The states\u2019 main complaint has been the lack of ability to make local decisions as the grants they get are mostly tied. This was why the SA premier, Jay Weatherill, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-13/jericho-this-bold-gst-proposal-could-help-with-the-sales-pitch/7085318\">proposed giving the states</a> a share of income tax revenue in place of the grants. </p> <p>His proposal did not allow for states to raise (or lower) income tax rates, but merely that they would get a set share of income tax, in much the same way they get a share of GST. </p> <p>The allowance for states to raise or lower tax rates introduces a whole new dynamic. It introduces competitive taxation, a recommendation of Tony Abbott\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ncoa.gov.au/report/phase-one/part-b/6-2-addressing-vertical-fiscal-imbalance.html\">commission of audit</a>.</p> <p>The belief goes that states could lower taxes to entice people to come to its state, but this would be countered by the need to provide services. Thus once again the belief is that states would again seek to deliver more efficient services in order to lower tax rates to again attract people to their state. </p> <p>By contrast, if a state lowered taxes too greatly and services suffered, people would leave to another state that might have higher taxes but better services.</p> <p>It sounds great if you love economics. </p> <p>The problem is people generally move for one reason: jobs. </p> <p>We know this already. </p> <p>As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/sep/28/for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-victoria-is-the-place-to-be-for-jobs\">noted last year</a> Victoria is experiencing a large net interstate migration boom, while WA is not:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Net annual interstate migration\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PTRds/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Has anyone ever suggested this is happening because WA\u2019s school system or health system is falling behind Victoria\u2019s, or because stamp duty is different in either state?</p> <p>Nope. It\u2019s because the mining boom has ended and Victoria for the first time in a decade has been doing well job-side.</p> <p>Given the costs of moving interstate, the difference in tax rates between the states would have to be massive to make the decision logical.</p> <p>But lack of logic is never much of an issue when it comes to pressure for lowering income tax. </p> <p>And this is the problem with competitive taxation \u2013 it only works if there is also a real \u201ccompetitive federalism\u201d \u2013 that is, competitive services and if the costs of moving between states is essentially nil.</p> <p>I have seen a number of jobs advertised in Sydney that I would love to do, but there is no way I am going to apply for them because the cost of leaving is too great: my wife has a job, my kids love their school and their friends. Were NSW to have a 2% lower tax rate than the ACT, it still wouldn\u2019t matter. </p> <p>The other problem with the story is that there is asymmetrical information. </p> <p>On the revenue side you have a very visible tax rate \u2013 easy to compare, easy to know, and with a lot of pressure on state governments to cut or at least to not raise (as Paul Keating told Tony Blair: \u201cDon\u2019t ever put up income tax, mate ... Do that and they\u2019d rip your fucking guts out.\u201d)</p> <p>On the other side we have schools and hospitals and other healthcare.</p> <p>Do you know if your child\u2019s school is better or worse than that in another state? Is your nearest hospital more efficient than that elsewhere?</p> <p>Sure we have the MySchool website, but really? C\u2019mon, be honest. Unless you are a researcher in those areas you have no idea, and even then the difference in test scores, waiting times, standard of care are hotly debatable and dependent upon various factors such as demographics. </p> <p>No one is moving across the nation because they heard a hospital in Victoria or Adelaide or Sydney or wherever has better service than their nearest. You might do it for a special operation or treatment \u2013 but even then it is only temporary.</p> <p>So what incentive is there for a state to raise taxes to produce better services that is not already there?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/31/malcolm-turnbulls-tax-plan-a-distraction-from-tony-abbotts-80bn-cuts\">Malcolm Turnbull's tax plan a 'distraction' from Tony Abbott's $80bn cuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How good does your state\u2019s healthcare need to be to entice people to move to access it? Or perhaps the more pertinent question: how bad does your service have to get before people will leave?</p> <p>For in reality all the incentive to be competitive is on the revenue side to lower taxes, and there is very little real competition on the expenditure side to improve services other than already exists.</p> <p>This policy thus introduces more incentive to cut revenue, and little incentive to improve services \u2013 the incentive on that side is to cut services and shift them on to the private sector. </p> <p>That\u2019s fine if you think that is a good result, but let\u2019s not pretend this is about improving government service delivery. </p> <p>If you are worried about service delivery, look at service delivery, not at the ability for states to lower taxes.</p> <p>If there is a funding issue for services because of an ageing population, then raise more revenue. Don\u2019t rearrange how the revenue is raised and hope the magic wand of reduced vertical fiscal imbalance will solve the rest.</p>",
