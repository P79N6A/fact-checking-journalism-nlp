With 50 being the point that separates expansion from contraction, the figures showed growth in the sector had slowed to a near standstill.</p> <p>The last time the reading fell below 50 was in September. \"The Chinese economy is still struggling at the bottom,\" said Haibin Zhu, the chief China economist of JPMorgan in Hong Kong.</p> <p>In a second report also released on Monday, Markit and HSBC said their PMI hit a nine-month low of 48.2 in June, down from 49.2 in May.

      "bodyText": "China's vast manufacturing output slowed in June, painting a gloomy picture for growth as the country emerges from its worst cash crunch in at least a decade. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI), an important gauge of manufacturing activity, fell to 50.1, down from 50.8 in May. With 50 being the point that separates expansion from contraction, the figures showed growth in the sector had slowed to a near standstill. The last time the reading fell below 50 was in September. \"The Chinese economy is still struggling at the bottom,\" said Haibin Zhu, the chief China economist of JPMorgan in Hong Kong. In a second report also released on Monday, Markit and HSBC said their PMI hit a nine-month low of 48.2 in June, down from 49.2 in May. The measure is based on a survey of more then 420 manufacturing companies, many of them small and medium-sized. The official figures focus on larger enterprises. Employment figures also dropped in June at the \"fastest [rate] since last August, and joint fastest since the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009,\" according to HSBC. Manufacturing and exports have long been the main pillars of China's economy, and the figures suggest that both have taken a serious hit as a result of economic sluggishness both at home and abroad. For the first time since the Asian financial crisis in 1998, China is at serious risk of missing its official annual growth target, set at 7.5% this year. \"The weak PMI reinforces our view that there is 30% chance GDP may drop below 7% in the third or fourth quarter,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, the chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong. China's GDP grew by 7.7% in the first quarter of 2013, down from 7.9% in the previous quarter and far below an average growth rate of 10.5% over the past decade. The World Bank cut its growth forecast for China last month, saying that it would likely grow 7.7% in 2013. It had earlier predicted 8.4%. Demand for Chinese products remains weak in Europe and the US, China's two main export markets. China's central bank moved to slow rampant credit growth last month by refusing to inject liquidity into the country's financial system, causing inter-bank lending rates to spike. Bloomberg called the event the \"worst cash crunch in a decade\". Analysts said that by allowing the liquidity crisis to unfold, Beijing had shown itself willing to sacrifice some growth for a more stable financial system. China's president, Xi Jinping, said on Saturday that local officials should never be judged \"simply by the growth of gross domestic product,\" the state newswire Xinhua reported signalling that the highest level leadership would not respond to slower growth with more stimulus. The cash crunch \"is likely to slow expansion of off-balance sheet lending, further exacerbating funding conditions for [small and medium enterprises],\" HSBC's co-head of Asian economic research Hongbin Qu said in a commentary accompanying the bank's report. \"As Beijing refrains from using stimulus, the ongoing growth slowdown is likely to continue in the coming months.\" Signs have emerged that the country's banking system is regaining its equilibrium, but although inter-bank lending rates have dropped over the past week, they remain significantly higher than before the cash crunch began in late May. \"The tight liquidity condition on the interbank market has been easing in the last few days,\" chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission Shang Fulin said on Saturday, according to Bloomberg.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou's latest outburst has served as a reminder, if one were needed, that easyJet is not your average FTSE 100 company. In an open letter to shareholders published on Monday, the airline's founder and biggest shareholder hit out at what he described as its secret deal with Airbus to buy 135 planes, with options to buy a further 100. Wielding his family's 37% stake, he warned fellow shareholders the board was trying to pull the wool over their eyes. Stelios's objection is based on what he argues is the high risk inherent in buying too many aircraft too quickly and expanding into unprofitable routes. This is despite the airline's assertion that 85 of the aircraft would replace ageing planes and that flexibility has been built into the deal to allow it to respond to economic conditions. He also criticised the company's failure to disclose the discount it was getting on the aircraft, but at the same time was certain \"that this is a good deal for Airbus and a bad deal for easyJet shareholders\". In January, he revealed that he had sold 200,000 shares in protest against the potential fleet expansion and his brother and sister sold the same number. At the time he threatened to reduce his stake further should easyJet press ahead with the new plane orders. If shareholders do vote through the plans at the extraordinary meeting on 11 July, the board may be granted two wishes at once. Stelios says he expects shareholders to approve the plans. But he is not out of the board's hair yet, and made clear his intention to keep up the pressure. \"I strongly believe public company directors should be legally held to account for their decisions.

Since troika officials from the EU, ECB and IMF began visiting Athens to pour over the nation\u2019s financial book-keeping, inspection tours have been fraught with friction in a game that, more often than not, resembles a match of constant goal-post moving than one adhered to with fixed rules.</p> <p>Today\u2019s visit is no different. While ties have generally improved in the year since the smooth-talking technocrat <strong>Yiannis Stournaras</strong> was elevated to the post of finance minister, this afternoon\u2019s discussions are genuinely expected to be \u201cvery tough.\u201d</p> <p>The troika has made clear that it will only disburse aid when, and if, specific reforms are taken. The likelihood of the country\u2019s super tranche \u2013 \u20ac8.1bn in aid \u2013 being dispatched in installments is now a given.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to make for a very heavy climate but they have made it very clear that that is what they are going to do,\u201d said one insider. \u201cEvery time we announce a measure, we\u2019ll get an installment. That is the premise they are working on.\u201d</p> <p>Measures now mean pubic sector dismissals \u2013 the red line no Greek government has wanted to cross since the outbreak of the debt crisis in late 2009. The troika wants 15,000 civil servants cut from the payroll in 2015. The government missed yesterday\u2019s deadline of placing some 12,500 in a mobility scheme and the Administrative Reform Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he would ask for a two-month extension when he met troika mission heads at 7:30pm (local time) (5.30pm BST) tonight.</p> <p>This is unlikely to go down well. Before the fraca over the closure of state broadcaster ERT \u2013 one that the government will surely use to highlight the sensitivity of public sector sackings -- troika officials were demanding names and numbers and are going to be reluctant to move the goal posts again. If they do, there will have to be concessions elsewhere \u2013 most likely in the reining in of public spending at Greece\u2019s main healthcare provider, EOPYY.</p> <p>The projected financing gap of \u20ac4bn by the second half of 2014 (when Greece\u2019s second bailout programme is due to end) has added to the black mood.</p> <p>So has the slow pace of privatisations with officials on both sides now openly recognising the impossibility of raising \u20ac2.6bn through the sale of state assets by the end of the year. The atmosphere will worsen considerably if the \u20ac700m euro sale of the state lottery company OPAP also falls through. Speculation of this happening has exacerbated tensions with creditors in recent days. Its collapse would automatically increase the need for further cuts to put the bailout programme on track.</p> <p>The health ministry, with EOPYY at the fore, is likely to be called on to carry most of the burden of covering the looming budget gap. The new health minister, Adonis Georgiades, was appointed to the post precisely because he has no ties with the medical community thus making it easier for him to wield the axe.&#xa0;On Sunday evening he lived up to expectation promising he will close hospitals to meet targets \u201cif necessary\u201d.</p> <p>It will be the beginning of the new measures the government is so vehemently insisting it will not take when everything suggests that new measures are in the offing.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-07-01T17:16:16.386Z\">at 6.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51d1b157e4b0202f5347ab89\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-01T16:42:02.978Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reuters is now reporting that <strong>Vitor Gaspar</strong> blamed his resignation on eroding public support for Portugal's austerity programme, and the court ruling earlier this year that blocked planned cuts to payments for pensioners and public workers.</p> <p>The outgoing finance minister also warned that the \"risks and challenges ahead are enormous\", and admitted his credibility had been damaged by Portugal's struggle to hit its deficit targets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-548c9b99-9d45-44df-af3f-9603affd8ee9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/1/1372696887365/ed6b3c9f-d6cf-4413-bb86-b2d2f968d862-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"A file photograph dated 07 June 2013 of Portuguese Finance minister, Vitor Gaspar, who resigned from the Social Democratic Government, Lisbon, Portugal, 01 July 2013.O RELVAS\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portuguese finance minister, Vitor Gaspar, who resigned from the Social Democratic Government today.

It blamed recent declines in the value of Greek debt, uncertainty over whether it will get its aid tranche, and tension within its government.</p> <p>Or in Japonica's words, the threat of:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>prospective debt haircuts, Greece government intracoalition relations, reports of a potential \u20ac3bn to \u20ac4bn funding gap, privatization revenue shortfalls, reports of a \u20ac1.2bn health-care-cost funding gap, the closure [of state broadcaster ERT], and concerns regarding quarter-end portfolio performance markings for such illiquid securities.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Greece is in such a mess, you'd think Japonica would keep away.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. Here's a brief closing summary. \u2022 Greece's government has begun a new round of crucial talks with officials fom its lenders. At issue, whether to advance the country's next aid tranche, worth around \u20ac8bn. Insiders warned tonight that tension between the two sides is high, as the Troika probes whether Greece has made enough progress cutting civil service staff levels, and selling state assets. Latest analysis from Helena Smith in Athens is here: \u2022 Portugal's finance minister has resigned. Vitor Gaspar blamed falling public support for the country's austerity programme, and warned that the Lisbon government faced a difficult future (see 5.03pm onwards). \u2022 Eurozone unemployment levels hit new record highs, with the jobless rate rising to 12.1%. The latest figures from Eurostat showed that Spain, Greece and Portugal still have the highest unemployment rates, particularly for young people, while Cyprus's labour market has deteriorated sharply (see 10.14am onwards). \u2022 The latest factory data offered some respite for southern Europe. Spain and Italy both posted better-than expected manufacturing PMI figures (see 8.39am onwards. However Germany and China (see 7.45am)'s PMI data missed forecasts, while the US version (see 3.06pm) showed a weakening labour market. \u2022 In the UK, Mark Carney took control at the Bank of England. There's video of Carney's first day here (3.22pm), and details of his trip on the Underground here (11.33am). I\"ll be back tomorrow. Until then, thanks and goodnight. With those crunch talks between the Greek finance ministry and the Troika underway, our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports that the situation is as tense as ever. She also flags up that Greec is very likely to only receive its next aid tranche in slices, rather than one lump sum. Here's Helena's analysls: Even when they look good, Greece\u2019s relations with the international creditors keeping its debt-stricken economy afloat are rarely without tension. Both sides regard the other with thinly disguised suspicion. Since troika officials from the EU, ECB and IMF began visiting Athens to pour over the nation\u2019s financial book-keeping, inspection tours have been fraught with friction in a game that, more often than not, resembles a match of constant goal-post moving than one adhered to with fixed rules. Today\u2019s visit is no different. While ties have generally improved in the year since the smooth-talking technocrat Yiannis Stournaras was elevated to the post of finance minister, this afternoon\u2019s discussions are genuinely expected to be \u201cvery tough.\u201d The troika has made clear that it will only disburse aid when, and if, specific reforms are taken. The likelihood of the country\u2019s super tranche \u2013 \u20ac8.1bn in aid \u2013 being dispatched in installments is now a given. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make for a very heavy climate but they have made it very clear that that is what they are going to do,\u201d said one insider. \u201cEvery time we announce a measure, we\u2019ll get an installment. That is the premise they are working on.\u201d Measures now mean pubic sector dismissals \u2013 the red line no Greek government has wanted to cross since the outbreak of the debt crisis in late 2009. The troika wants 15,000 civil servants cut from the payroll in 2015. The government missed yesterday\u2019s deadline of placing some 12,500 in a mobility scheme and the Administrative Reform Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he would ask for a two-month extension when he met troika mission heads at 7:30pm (local time) (5.30pm BST) tonight. This is unlikely to go down well. Before the fraca over the closure of state broadcaster ERT \u2013 one that the government will surely use to highlight the sensitivity of public sector sackings -- troika officials were demanding names and numbers and are going to be reluctant to move the goal posts again. If they do, there will have to be concessions elsewhere \u2013 most likely in the reining in of public spending at Greece\u2019s main healthcare provider, EOPYY. The projected financing gap of \u20ac4bn by the second half of 2014 (when Greece\u2019s second bailout programme is due to end) has added to the black mood. So has the slow pace of privatisations with officials on both sides now openly recognising the impossibility of raising \u20ac2.6bn through the sale of state assets by the end of the year. The atmosphere will worsen considerably if the \u20ac700m euro sale of the state lottery company OPAP also falls through. Speculation of this happening has exacerbated tensions with creditors in recent days. Its collapse would automatically increase the need for further cuts to put the bailout programme on track. The health ministry, with EOPYY at the fore, is likely to be called on to carry most of the burden of covering the looming budget gap. The new health minister, Adonis Georgiades, was appointed to the post precisely because he has no ties with the medical community thus making it easier for him to wield the axe. On Sunday evening he lived up to expectation promising he will close hospitals to meet targets \u201cif necessary\u201d. It will be the beginning of the new measures the government is so vehemently insisting it will not take when everything suggests that new measures are in the offing. Reuters is now reporting that Vitor Gaspar blamed his resignation on eroding public support for Portugal's austerity programme, and the court ruling earlier this year that blocked planned cuts to payments for pensioners and public workers. The outgoing finance minister also warned that the \"risks and challenges ahead are enormous\", and admitted his credibility had been damaged by Portugal's struggle to hit its deficit targets. It's official -- the Portuguese president has confirmed that Vitor Gaspar has stepped down as finance minister, to be replaced by treasury secretary Maria Luis de Albuquerque. Here's the statement from the presidency . And here's a rough translation: Pursuant to paragraph h) of Article 133 of the Constitution, the President accepted the proposal made by the Prime Minister, to dismiss, at his request, the Minister of State and Finance, Prof.. Dr. V\u00edtor Gaspar Lou\u00e7\u00e3 Raba\u00e7a. The President accepted the proposal made by the Prime Minister, the appointment of Dr. Luis Maria Casanova Morgado Dias de Albuquerque to the same office. The inauguration of the new member of the Government shall take place tomorrow, Tuesday, July 2, at 17:00 in the Palace of Bel\u00e9m. Reuters is now reporting that the Portuguese prime minister has accepted the resignation of Vitor Gaspar as finance minister (so the rumours were true....) He's been replaced by Maria Luis Albuquerque, previously the Treasury secretary. Portugal's finance minister, V\u00edtor Gaspar, may be throwing in the towel, with local media reporting tonight that he is considering tendering his resignation. There's nothing official, so treat with all caution. Gaspar has ploughed a tough furrow in Portugal, trying to implement spending cuts and tax rises demanded by the Troika, in the face of public anger. Peter Spiegel of the FT reports that Gaspar would be missed in Brussels: Europe's stock markets have begun the second half of 2013 with solid gains, led by Spain, Italy and the UK \u2013 where the FTSE 100 closed up 92 points. All three countries posted better-than-expected manufacturing data this morning, and this seems to have fed through to traders. Here's the closing prices: Steve Collins, global head of dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management, confirmed that the decent manufacturing data had dampened concerns over the situation in Greece. Another curious story involving Greece today: Japonica, a little-known US investment firm, has reduced the price at which it is prepared to buy Greek debt, but is keen to snaffle even more of the stuff. Japonica, of Rhode Island, caused a stir last month when it first proposed buying \u20ac2.9bn of Greek debt from existing creditors at 45% of its face value. Today, though, the company announced it will only pay 40 euro cents in the \u20ac1. It blamed recent declines in the value of Greek debt, uncertainty over whether it will get its aid tranche, and tension within its government. Or in Japonica's words, the threat of: prospective debt haircuts, Greece government intracoalition relations, reports of a potential \u20ac3bn to \u20ac4bn funding gap, privatization revenue shortfalls, reports of a \u20ac1.2bn health-care-cost funding gap, the closure [of state broadcaster ERT], and concerns regarding quarter-end portfolio performance markings for such illiquid securities. If Greece is in such a mess, you'd think Japonica would keep away. But the firm says it hasn't lost its appetite for Greek debt -- and is now prepared to buy \u20ac4bn-worth of bonds. The offer perplexed many in the City, and it's not clear whether anyone's taken up the offer. Greek debt had strengthened steadily since the drama of its two elections in 2012 - so anyone who bought bonds then is sitting on healthy profits. As Bloomberg argues here, they may not want to sell out to Japonica just yet.... Speaking of Greece, its government appears poised to pay \u20ac540m to a 'holdout' investor who didn't take part in last year's debt restructuring. The bond, which was issued under Swiss law, matures on Friday. Its owner refused to swap the debt for new, longer-maturity securities in March 2012. And Athens appears to have decided it's better to pay the debt off than refuse to honour it and provoke a legal battle. But while Greece seemingly has the money to settle with holdout creditors, it is still gunning for public services. Health minister Adonis Georgiadis caused alarm over the weekend by saying he was prepared to shut hospitals if it would drive up efficiency and cut costs. And bus drivers are up in arms over a plan to make passengers get on through the front doors, near their cabin, in an effort to stop fare-dodging. The talks between Troika officials and Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras over the country's bailout programme, and whether Athens should get its next aid tranche worth \u20ac8bn, are underway. Here's a photo of European Commission director Matthias Mors, centre, arriving for the meeting this afternoon: With government insiders already warning that the talks will be tough (see 2.12pm onwards) we could be in for a nervy few days.... Your chance to watch a rather powerful central banker walk down a corridor, open a door, and address the massed ranks of the Bank of England's senior staff: Carney appeared to be enjoying the attention, and didn't waste any time telling staff that he'd been there since 7am*. * - not bad for a newcomer. Reminder: I rounded up some of the reams of advice sent Carney's way at 1.10pm The news that hiring across America's manufacturing sector weakened last month (see 3.06pm) drove shares in London and Wall Street even higher (FTSE 100 now up 96 points, Dow up 166 points). Looks like we're back to bad news being good news, if it keeps the ultra-loose monetary policy in place.... The ISM survey of America's manufacturing sector is out (not to be confused with the Markit version released earlier), and it's a mixed picture. The headline figures has improved, rising to 50.9 (denoting growth), following last month's 49.0 (which showed a contraction). However, the 'employment index' part of the survey fell below the 50-point mark for the first time since September 2009, indicating a drop in hiring. And with the Federal Reserve targeting the labour market as well as headline GDP, that may also encourage central bankers to hold off tapering their bond-buying programmes.... The better-than-expected manufacturing data from Italy and Spain (hinting at eurozone recovery), and the weaker-than-expected manufacturing data from America (hinting at a slower end to the US stimulus package) have helped to push shares up today. Wall Street has opened higher, while in London the blue-chip Footsie is up 82 points, mirroring similar gains across Europe. \u2022 Dow Jones: up 114 points at 15025, +0.78% \u2022 FTSE 100: up 82 points at 6297, + 1.3% \u2022 German DAX: up 40 points at 799, + 0.5% \u2022 French CAC: up 30 points at 3769, +0.8% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 140 points at 7903, +1.8% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 261 point at 15501, +1.7% Back to economic data, and the first of two readings of the US manufacturing sector has been released, and is weaker than expected. Markit's PMI survey of America's factory sector last month came in at 51.9, which is the slowest pace of expansion in eight months. The data did show a small rise in business conditions, and output growth, but it suggests the US economy isn't recovering as fast as some analysts had hoped. And that may mean the Federal Reserve doesn't slow its stimulus package so quicky. Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, warned that: Manufacturing clearly down-shifted a gear between the first and second quarters, and is at risk of losing further momentum as we head into the second half of the year We get the rival ISM manufacturing data at 3pm BST. In the meantime, European shares are pushing higher - with the FTSE 100 up over 1%. Full round-up to follow As flagged up this morning, one of the key issues on the table in Greece is the planned dismissal of 15,000 civil servants by the end of 2014 and the placing of another 12,500 in a mobility scheme. Kathimerini has more details on this afternoon's talks between Greece and the Troika, pointing out that the meetings will run into tomorrow.... The troika is to begin its meetings at the Finance Ministry on Monday afternoon at 5 pm (3pm BST). They are due to meet new Administrative Reform Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at 7.30p.m [5.30pm BST]. Mitsotakis is expected to ask for more time to complete the mobility scheme. The inspectors will then visit the Labor Ministry on Tuesday morning. Over in Greece, we're still expecting talks between the government and officials from its lenders to resume this afternoon, around 3pm BST. As outlined this morning (8.23am) the Troika are back in town to see how the Greek government measures up against its bailout targets. And the mood music from Athens isn't encouraging, with one finance ministry official describing the negotiations between Greece and the troika as \"truly difficult\". A couple of newswires are also quoting unnamed eurozone officials warning that Greece hasn't yet done enough to qualify for its next aid tranche: The improvements in Italy and Spain's manufacturing sectors (see 8.39am onwards) have been welcomed in the City, while the latest eurozone unemployment gloom (10.14am) has been shrugged off. Spanish and Italian government bonds have strengthened in value, pushing their borrowing costs down. The yield (interest rate) on a Spanish 10-year sovereign bond has now fallen to 4.628%, down from 4.71% on Friday night. The Italian equivalent dropped to 4.49% (from 4.53%). Both countries' bonds had fallen in value since the US Federal Reserve laid out how to slow, and stop its stimulus package amost two weeks ago. With several Fed officials having made soothing noises since, traders may reckon there's less to worry about - and that peripheral eurozone debt looks safer again... A couple more photos of Mark Carney's first morning at the Bank of England: The new governor hits the ground running with his first meeting of the monetary policy committee this week (where interest rates and quantitative easing programmes are set). But what should his priorities be? Saturday's Guardian leader column urged Carney to get to grips with Britain's banks, and use every lever he can find to drive growth: The new governor has already hinted that he would like a more flexible inflation target (perhaps keeping CPI to 2% over three not two years); he should go further and push for a Federal Reserve-style remit that sets off moderate inflation against the need for jobs (and wage) growth. Now is also the time to use QE, that is public money, to direct investment into key sectors (such as green energy) and under-industrialised regions. Mr Carney is famously smooth, but if he does not start his tenure by picking a few important fights, it will be a disappointing omen. While five experts have given the Observer their views on the challenges facing Carney -- from weaning Britain off ultra-loose monetary policy to improving the Bank's own credibilty. Here's the details: A little advice, Mr Carney \u2026 your credibility will be crucial While the British Chamber of Commerce has called for more help for small firms. And you can vote here on whether Carney will do better than Sir Mervyn King. Over in Cyprus, the finance ministry reports that it has completed a bond-swap with investors, fulfilling another condition of its bailout deal: From the Reuters terminal: Cyprus said on Monday it had completed the exchange of \u20ac1bn in maturing domestic government debt for new longer-term government paper as part of its financial adjustment programme. Five types of bonds with maturities ranging from six to 10 years were issued, offering the same coupons as the government bonds they replaced, term sheets issued by the finance ministry said. This swap helps Cyprus as it reduces the amount of sovereign debt it must repay during the lifespan of its bailout programme. But the exchange also saw its credit rating cut to selective default by S&amp;P last Friday (as the new terms are less favourable) Back to London, and my colleague Jennifer Rankin has established that Mark Carney braved the Underground on his first day at the Bank of England this morning. She writes that governor Carney was spotted by at least one City worker, who was able to point him in the right direction: The Canadian central banker is tipped to shake up the 319-year old institution, which has been criticised by politicians for insularity and group-think and not enough vigilance in the runup to the financial crisis. This change of style also starts \u2013 today at least \u2013 with a journey on the central line, stuffy on a midsummer morning, although he did at least get a seat. \"It is nice to see someone being suitably parsimonious,\" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, managing director of Seven Investment Management, who spotted Carney on the tube. \"I've established he definitely wasn't George Clooney,\" he said. \"I wished him good luck.\" Urquhart Stewart also advised Carney on the best exit to take at Bank underground station. If only all Carney's dilemmas were so easily solved.... More here: Mark Carney takes tube to office on first day as Bank of England governor City analysts believe the eurozone unemployment rate will keep rising in the months ahead, after hitting 12.1% in May (see 10.14am onwards for details). Martin van Vliet of ING explains: The country breakdown showed that the increase in unemployment was broadly-based, with Cyprus again standing out negatively (16.3% versus 15.8% previously) but Germany and Austria bucking the trend of increased unemployment. Looking ahead, an end to the Eurozone labour market downturn is not yet imminent. Indeed, the employment expectations indices from the European Commission\u2019s business survey are still at levels consistent with further increases in unemployment. However, with the recession across the Eurozone petering out, the peak in unemployment should not be too far away either. While Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight has predicted that the rate will hit 12.5% by the end of this year, despite today's encouraging manufacturing PMIs (see 9.27am). Archer writes: A general turnaround in Eurozone labour markets still looks some way off so unemployment seems set to rise appreciably further. The situation will likely vary markedly between countries. While, Eurozone GDP could have finally stopped contracting in the second quarter after a record six quarters of decline, overall economic activity is likely to remain too weak through 2013, and very possibly during the early months of 2014, to prevent unemployment from rising further. The cost of living in the eurozone picked up late last month, but at 1.6% the consumer prices index remained low in historical terms. Eurostat said the increase in the CPI, from 1.4% last month, was due to increased costs of food, alcohol and tobacco, energy, and services. The European Central Bank's aim is to keep inflation close to, but below, 2%, so today's reading shouldn't alarm policymakers, and might even calm fears of deflation. Although, as Mario Draghi explained at his most recent press conference on June 6: The fact that inflation is low is not, by itself, bad; with low inflation, you can buy more stuff. Nice to see an economist cutting through the jargon.... Last week, European leaders were proudly announcing that they'd put \u20ac8bn aside to fight youth unemployment. Today's data confirms that the problem is particularly severe in southern Europe. Greece is suffering a youth unemployment rate of 59.2%, followed by Spain with 56.5% and Portugal with 42.1%. Northern European countries are in much better shape, particularly Germany (7.6%), Austria (8.7%) and the Netherlands (10.6%). Eurostat has calculated that there are 3.531m young people out of work in the eurozone, up by 60,000 on a year ago, and 5.5m across the Euopean Union. The only upside? Eurostat has revised its historical data down, so that the youth jobless rate is 23.8% across the eurozone (not the 24.4% estimated last month). And while the eurozone jobless rate hit a new record high, the rate in the European Union was flat in May, at 10.9%. That's because the proportion of people out of work in some EU countries outside the euro fell, including Sweden (from 8.3% to 7.9), and Denmark (from 5.4% to 5.3%). Seventeen members of the eurozone have higher unemployment rates than a year ago, and 10 have lower rates -- which pushed the jobless rate up to today's 12.1% in May. Once again, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.7%), Germany (5.3%) and Luxembourg (5.7%), and the highest in Spain (26.9%) and Greece (26.8% in March 2013). Cyprus, which was dragged into a bailout crisis earlier this month, suffered the biggest annual rise - from 11.4% in May 2012 to 16.3% this year. Greece's jobless rate rose from 22.2% to 26.8% over the last year. And Slovenia, which is fighting to avoid taking a bailout, has seen its jobless rate increase from 8.6% a year ago to 11.2% today. The largest decreases were observed in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. The unemployment rate across the eurozone hit record levels in May, as the recession continued to hurt workers across the region. Eurostat reported that the jobless rate across the eurozone was 12.1% in May, up from 12.0% in April. It was driven by increased unemployment rates in countries at the heart of the crisis, including Spain, Italy, and Ireland. The number of people out of work across the eurozone rose by 67,000, and picked up by 16,000 in the wider European Union. And young people continued to find themselves in the front line of the jobless crisis -- the youth unemployment rate was 23.0% in the EU27 and 23.8% in the euro area, up from 22.8% and 23.0% respectively a year ago. There are now 26.405m unemployed men and women in the EU27, of whom 19.222 million were in the euro area. The only reason for optimism is that Eurostat has revised down its earlier data slightly-- it had previously estimated the eurozone jobless rate at 12.2% in May. That's small comfort, though. Details and reaction to follow.... Jeremy Cook of World First says the City was cheered by the news that Britain's manufacturing sector enjoyed its best month in two years (see 9.41am) Sterling and gilts are higher after the announcement which is a nice welcoming present for the new Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, on his first day in the job\u2026\u201d The new orders component which tends to suggest that demand should be continual as opposed to stop/start has also seen a rise to the highest level since February 2011 and the fact that demand has increased from across the world allows some insulation from individual market shocks. I failed to mention Greeece's manufacturing PMI earlier. It came in at 45.4, up from May's 45.3, and its highest level in almost two years. It still shows a deep contraction, though \u2013 just less severe than in previous months. And while new orders and employment levels fell at smaller rates, production levels dropped by more than in May. Hardly a shock, given the economy is still shrinking. Britain's factor sector also enjoyed a decent June, posting its strongest growth in more than two years. Markit's UK manufacturing PMI jumped to 52.5 last month, showing stronger growth following May's 51.5. The data showed a rise in new business, with increased orders from within the UK and abroad. Markit said the data showed that the UK economy was picking up pace (no wonder Mark Carney had a smile on his face this morning...). GDP probably grew by around 0.5% in the last three months, it said. David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, said momentum was building in the manufacturing sector, although this hadn't fed through to the jobs market yet: The industry experienced another good month to round off a solid Q2. Employment is the one disappointing spot, showing little change from last month; a reminder of the anxiety that still exists in the sector. A reminder that Italy's economy is still strugging \u2013 the seasonally-adjusted jobless rate has hit a new record high of 12.2% in May. It's the highest rate since records began in 1977, up from 12.0% in April. And Italy's employment rate remained anemically low at just 56% (showing that little over half the adult population is actually in the labour market). The youth unemployment rate fell a little, though, to 38.5% from 39.9% the previous month. At 10am BST we get the overall jobless figure for the eurozone. So in summary, today's manufacturing data has given us reasons for optimism in Italy (9.00am), Spain (8.39am) and France (9.04am), but raised concerns over Germany (9.09am) and China (7.45am). That suggests that the eurozone slump is easing, at a time when stronger economies are finding conditions rather tougher. We should applaud any signs that firms in the periphery are managing to drag themselves, and their economies, out of the mire. And as Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight explained: The hope for manufacturers is that gradually rising confidence encourages businesses to invest more, and encourages consumers to spend a little more. Meanwhile, muted input prices are helping Eurozone manufacturers to price competitively. Hold the schadenfreude, though. Despite a tough June, German factories remain in much better shape than Southern European countries who managed to survive the recession. And once the eurozone does emerge from its slump, Germany's Mittelstand of small and medium-sized firms will be poised to benefit. ... but Germany's factory output fell in June, in the one obvious disappointment amid this morning's encouraging data. German manufacturing PMI fell to 48.6, from May's 49.4 - which means a deeper downturn. Markit blamed the downturn on falling orders, with economist Mark Wingham commenting: The German manufacturing sector appears to have remained in the doldrums in June, with a renewed drop in new orders acting as a drag on output growth. Today's splurge of PMI data also offered respite for France, with activity shrinking at the slowest rate in 16 months. Its PMI rose to 48.4, up from 46.4 in May. Still a contraction, but at a slower rate.... Italy's manufacturing PMI has also beaten expectations by hitting its highest level since July 2011, hot on the heels of Spain's own decent performance. At 49.1, the Italian PMI beat forecasts and showed that the sector enjoyed a less troubled time in June. Although that still shows falling activity, it's a a much stronger reading than May's 47.3. Markit said the last three months had ended 'positively for the Italian manufacturing sector', with firms actually producing a higher output than in May. As with Spain (see 8.39am), Italy benefitted from higher exports. Phil Smith, economist at Markit, warned that the situation was fragile: The headline index\u2019s latest rise was largely due to a return to growth in output from a solid rate of decline seen in May. The upturn won\u2019t be sustained, however, unless we also see the level of new orders in the sector rising in coming months. Meanwhile, in London, the new governor of the Bank of England has got down to business. Mark Carney turned up to work looking undaunted by the task at hand. I'm prepared to wager my last euro that he'll look less tanned and relaxed when his term ends in 2018, after five years of British weather and monetary policy. Spain's manufacturing sector has finally stopped deteriorating, according to data just released that could bring some much-needed relief to Madrid. Markit, the data firm, reported that the Spanish PMI came in at exactly 50.0. That's the best result since April 2011, before the Spanish economy entered its current long, deep recession. New orders increased, and unemployment fell at a slower rate, dragging the PMI up from last month's 48.1. The graph shows how Spain's factories barely struggled out of the post-Lehman Brothers slump, before entering a new downturn: One month's PMI data doesn't make a summer, but Markit is optimistic that the decline in the Spanish manufacturing sector is coming to an end. Markit economist Andrew Harker explained that Spain was benefitting from exports rather than local demand: The second quarter of 2013 ended on an encouraging note for the Spanish manufacturing sector, with PMI data pointing to a rise in new business and an easing in the rate of decline in production. The improved performance was heavily reliant on export growth, however, with little sign of recovery in domestic client demand. It's a stronger performance than economists had expected, as Frederik Ducrozet explains: Greece's Kathimerini newspaper reports that the Troika may try to impose new austerity measures on the Greek government when they meet this afternoon (see 8.16am). It has got its hands on a draft memorandum which suggests further cuts may be demanded, if Antonis Samaras's government doesn't fix a black hole in Greece's funding. It reports: According to the draft document, unspecified new measures may have to be taken if authorities fail to collect adequate revenue from outstanding debts to the state and fail to plug a funding gap for this year of just over \u20ac1bn, chiefly attributed to the debts of the country\u2019s main healthcare provider, EOPYY. One potential method of narrowing the funding gap likely to be proposed by troika officials is the payment of the emergency property tax for 2013 in four instalments rather than five. Such a move would narrow the funding gap for this year by an estimated \u20ac400m, troika officials are expected to argue. Kathimerini also reports that Greece's new administrative reform minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, will seek a two-month extension in which to select 12,500 civil servants who will be moved into a mobility scheme, in which the employees will receive a reduced wage for a year before a status review. More here: Troika due back in Athens, with mixed agenda The eurozone crisis has been punctuated by regular meetings between officials from the Troika (the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission) and one government or another. And today it's Greece's turn, as officials from Greece's lenders return to Athens to complete their assessment of its economy. Finance minister Yannis Stournaras is due to sit down with the Troika at 5pm local time (3pm BST), after a two-week break (officials excused themselves from Greece as the row over closing its state broadcaster, EPA, broke out). At issue, whether Greece has done enough to receive its next bailout tranche, worth \u20ac8.1bn. The government hopes for a slightly easier ride: The lenders will give us trouble but less so than in previous reviews. But there are two obvious stumbling blocks: 1) Greece's privatisation programme, which is behind schedule after the failure to sell its gas network DEPA (more here), and dogged by rumours of problems over the sale of gambling form OPAP (more here). 2) Civil service layoffs. The troika wants tens of thousands of public workers cut from the payroll. The government has been flagging on this issue (although shutting EPA will help). There's speculation that the troika might only hand over a portion of the \u20ac8.1bn on the table. Reuters reports: To pressure Athens to deliver on reforms, the trio of lenders might refuse to pay the full sum in one go and break it up into three monthly payments instead, Greek media reported. \"The biggest issue in the negotiations will be the delays in public sector reforms,\" a senior finance ministry official told Reuters. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. It's a busy day for economic data, with surveys from Beijing to Berlin throwing new light on the state of the global economy. That includes the latest eurozone jobless data (at 10am BST). While in Greece, officials from its Troika of lenders are due back in Athens for another round of talks over its bailout programme (more on this shortly). Already in \u2013 fresh evidence that China's factories struggled in June. A monthly assessment of Chinese factory output conducted by HSBC bank, and an official government report, both showed that manufacturers were suffering from falling demand from overseas, and at home. That will reinforce fears over an economic slowdown in China, and underlines that the world economy remains a tough environment. HSBC's PMI survey fell to a nine-month low of 48.2, which indicates that the sector contracted, while the government's own survey came in at 50.1 \u2013 showing virtually no growth, and a hefty fall on May's 50.8. Analysts are downbeat about prospects in China. Haibin Zhu, chief China economist of JPMorgan in Hong Kong, said: The Chinese economy is still struggling at the bottom. While Xianfang Ren, an economist at IHS, was no more positive, saying: The Chinese economy is far from out of the woods yet. With China cracking down on its shadow banking sector, any signs of rapid cooling in its economy will be a concern. Is Europe coping any better? We'll find out in the next few hours, with new surveys of manufacturing output from across the eurozone. And then, new jobless data which will show if Europe's unemployment crisis, particularly among the young, has worsened. I'll be tracking all the action through the day.",

Exposure to attractive diamond market fundamentals combined with a strong growth profile.  St. James's Place. In our view the recent weakness in the share price has been largely driven by the surprise second placing of shares by Lloyds Bank. We expect this to fade in the third quarter with investor focus returning to the strong underlying business performance and fully intact investment case. <strong>The following companies have been removed from the list:</strong> <br> G4S. Management change and potential strategic change suggest limited upside potential in the near term.  Lonmin. Elevated labour risk is likely to weigh on share price performance in the foreseeable future.  Spirit Pub Company. Following a strong share price performance over the last three months we believe there are limited catalysts to drive the stock forward in the short term.  Unilever. The shares have risen 7% over the past 6 months, outperforming the UK market by 3%. We have recently cut our forecasts and target price to reflect emerging market currency weakness and, even though we maintain our buy recommendation, we have removed the stock from our Top Pick list.  William Hill. Following a strong share price performance, and looking ahead to the second quarter trading update, we feel tough year-on-year comparatives (Euro 2012) and a potentially weaker UK retail performance could mean the shares pause for breath. </blockquote>",

Following a strong share price performance over the last three months we believe there are limited catalysts to drive the stock forward in the short term. Unilever. The shares have risen 7% over the past 6 months, outperforming the UK market by 3%. We have recently cut our forecasts and target price to reflect emerging market currency weakness and, even though we maintain our buy recommendation, we have removed the stock from our Top Pick list. William Hill. Following a strong share price performance, and looking ahead to the second quarter trading update, we feel tough year-on-year comparatives (Euro 2012) and a potentially weaker UK retail performance could mean the shares pause for breath.",

      "bodyText": "UK factories cranked up production last month to report their strongest growth for two years, fuelling hopes Britain's economic recovery is gaining momentum. Activity in the manufacturing sector rose for the third straight month as new orders picked up at home and abroad, according to the closely watched Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI). The upbeat news adds to recent survey evidence that UK economic growth has accelerated over recent months and it reduces the likelihood of the Bank of England opting for any more stimulus at the new governor Mark Carney's first monetary policy meeting this week. The growth will come as welcome news to the government as it maintains its mantra that the economy needs to rebalance towards manufacturing and be less dependent on services. The manufacturing sector currently makes up just 10% of the UK economy. This latest survey suggests recovery was broad-based across the sector with textiles and clothing and food and drink enjoying the strongest growth. The headline index rose to a 25-month high of 52.5 in June, up from 51.5 in May. That was well above the 50-mark that divides expansion from contraction and beat the forecast of 51.5 in a Reuters poll of economists. Survey compilers Markit said the survey suggested that manufacturing output rose by around 0.5% over the second quarter of this year. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit said: \"The UK manufacturing sector made positive strides on the recovery path during the second quarter of the year. June saw output and new order growth hit rates not seen since early 2011, as a brightening domestic market and resilient overseas demand led to a broad-based expansion across the sector.\" Economists said the survey added to signs the overall economy gathered pace in the second quarter after lacklustre growth in the first three months of the year when manufacturing declined. Howard Archer, at IHS Global Insight, said three consecutive months of expansion indicated by the survey \"fuels hope that the sector is establishing genuine recovery\". \"The indications are therefore that manufacturing output achieved clear expansion in the second quarter, which reinforces hopes that GDP growth was stronger and more widely based than it had been in the first quarter. Indeed, it is looking like the GDP growth rate could have doubled in the second quarter from the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter rate seen in the first quarter,\" he said. So far, the pickup in output and orders does not appear to be boosting job creation in the sector, according to the survey. The employment balance was broadly unchanged in June. Separate PMI surveys by Markit for the eurozone showed manufacturing there continued to suffer an overall drop in activity in June but the pace of decline slowed. The headline balance rose to a 16-month high of 48.8 from 48.3 in May. Markit said output rose in both Germany and the Netherlands, but it was the periphery where the most encouraging signs were being seen. Ireland and Italy returned to growth, and the rate of decline in Spain eased sharply. Greece and France were the worst performers.

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney started his first day as governor of the Bank of England with an old London ritual \u2013 a trip on the Central line. Carney arrived at Threadneedle Street by tube shortly before 7am, ahead of most camera crews and photographers hoping to catch a glimpse of the governor feted as the rock star of central banking. The former Goldman Sachs executive was wooed by the chancellor, George Osborne, last autumn from the Bank of Canada with a bumper \u00a3874,000 pay deal that makes him one of the UK's best-paid public servants. Expectations are running high that Carney, described by Osborne as \"the outstanding central banker of his generation\", will be able to provide the kickstart that propels the economy out of a shaky recovery. He is tipped to shake up the 319-year old institution, which has been criticised by politicians for insularity and group-think and not enough vigilance in the runup to the financial crisis. The change of style began with a journey on the Central line, stuffy on a midsummer morning, although he did at least get a seat. \"It is nice to see someone being suitably parsimonious,\" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, the managing director of Seven Investment Management, who spotted Carney on the tube. \"I've established he definitely wasn't George Clooney,\" he said. \"I wished him good luck.\" Urquhart Stewart also advised Carney on the best exit to take at Bank station. Carney also took part in another national pastime on Sunday, when he watched a cricket match at a Bank of England's sports day, affording him a chance to mingle with his new colleagues. Sir Mervyn King, the bank's retired governor and a keen cricketer, stepped up to the crease, as did Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury. Carney, who played hockey in his youth, did not try his luck. On his first day in office, which is also Canada Day, Carney is being bombarded with advice from all sides. The British Chambers of Commerce has called on him to boost the economy by expanding the Bank's quantitative easing (QE) programme, while the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont urged him to shun the printing press, arguing it makes recovery harder in the long run. Carney will face this dilemma at the Bank's monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, where he could find himself on the losing side. \"It is a different world for him. Everything we know about a man like this is that he is very confident about how to deal with people, \"said Urquhart Stewart. \"There is not a huge amount he can do, but he is a breath of fresh air.\" The new governor earns a basic salary of \u00a3480,000, pension contributions worth \u00a3144,000 and a \u00a3250,000 a year housing allowance to help him adjust to London's overheated property market. Earlier this year his wife, the British-born economist Diana Carney, sparked a Twitter flurry after she seemed to bemoan the difficulties of finding a home in London.",

      "bodyText": "The former boss of the defunct Anglo Irish Bank has apologised for comments made by senior executives in 2008 mocking the institution's mounting losses and its need for a multibillion euro bailout. David Drumm, who was chief executive at the time the comments were recorded, said he was \"shocked and embarrassed\" by the content of the telephone conversations which were leaked to an Irish newspaper last week. There was \"no excuse for the terrible language or the frivolous tone,\" he said. \"I sincerely regret the offence it has caused. I cannot change this now but I can apologise to those who had to listen to it and who were understandably so offended by it.\" The tapes were made in 2008, when the Irish government was in talks to bail out a number of the country's troubled banks. German money flowed to Irish banks after the government issued a blanket guarantee for deposits. In the recordings, Drumm can be heard laughing while a fellow Anglo Irish executive sings the German national anthem. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, reacted with anger to the tapes and expressed her contempt for the disgraced bankers. \"This is simply very hard to swallow for people who go to work normally every day, who earn their money. It really damages democracy, the social market economy and everything that we are working for,\" she said. Drumm's colleague John Bowe was recorded saying he picked the figure of \u20ac7bn (\u00a36bn) \"out of my arse\" when authorities asked him how much would be needed to rescue the bank. \"Listening to a recording made almost five years ago at a highly stressful and volatile uncertain time is both embarrassing and a shocking reminder of how much pressure my colleagues and I were under at that time,\" Drumm said over the weekend. The failed bank was nationalised in 2009 and a year later the Irish government needed a \u20ac30bn bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.",
