      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s aviation regulator has begun enforcement action against Ryanair to make the budget airline pay compensation to thousands of delayed passengers in the wake of a European court judgment. Its announcement came hours after a final ruling from the European court of justice opened the floodgates for compensation claims against airlines that could run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Individuals will be able to claim as much as \u20ac600 (\u00a3437) a head after the court said airlines must pay out if flights are delayed or cancelled for \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d. Thousands of claims made by passengers of Ryanair, Flybe, Thomas Cook, Jet2 and WizzAir were put on hold pending the outcome of the ruling, which involved Dutch airline KLM. Once the judgment was handed down, the UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority revealed it had already been reviewing Ryanair\u2019s compliance with European consumer law, and had concluded that it was \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with the way the airline was handling compensation claims for disruption caused by routine technical faults. The CAA said that because Ryanair was not complying with the law, it was taking enforcement action to ensure UK passengers were protected - and it warned that if the airline did not change its policy, court action could follow. Thursday\u2019s ruling concerned a flight from Quito in Ecuador to Amsterdam taken in 2009 by passenger Corina van der Lans, which was delayed by 29 hours. Her claim for compensation was rejected after KLM argued it could not be held responsible for technical problems that emerged just before take off. Most airlines, particularly budget carriers, have routinely rejected claims from passengers seeking compensation until the outcome of the KLM case. The court ruled: \u201cThe airline must ensure the maintenance and proper functioning of all aircrafts used for commercial activities. No component of an aircraft is indestructible; these situations are inherent in the normal operations of an airline. Therefore, when a flight is cancelled due to unforeseen technical errors, the airline remains obliged to pay compensation to its passengers.\u201d Compensation lawyers said they will now go back to court with thousands of cases rejected by budget airlines. Kevin Clarke, flight delay lawyer with solicitors Bott &amp; Co, said it had 15,000 cases pending against airlines, with Ryanair making up the largest group. \u201cWe brought clarity to the law when we won the case of Huzar v Jet2. Technical issues are not extraordinary; they are claimable. \u201cThe fact that the same issue has had to go to the European court of justice despite the [UK] supreme court ruling shows the lengths the airline industry will go to to avoid paying out on valid claims. Fortunately the courts have once again ruled in favour of consumers \u2013 we\u2019re delighted with this outcome.\u201d Under the EU compensation rules, passengers whose flight is cancelled or arrives more than three hours late can claim \u20ac250-\u20ac600 depending on the distance of the flight. The compensation applies to flights departing from any EU airport or arriving in the EU with an EU carrier or one from Iceland, Norway or Switzerland. Ryanair said: \u201cRyanair notes today\u2019s decision in the KLM case and will continue to comply with the EU261 legislation. Since less than half of 1% of Ryanair flights are delayed by over three hours, this ruling will have less effect on Ryanair than any other airline.\u201d Commenting on the CAA\u2019s move, he said the airline was unsure why enforcement action was being threatened when Ryanair was complying fully with EU 261 regulations. Passengers seeking compensation may still face a battle for compensation. Airlines frequently cite \u201cadverse weather conditions\u201d, which allows them to legally sidestep claims. However, determined travellers have later proved there were no weather problems. Airlines are now likely to shift to a separate defence to reject compensation claims, claiming that the technical fault was actually a \u201chidden manufacturing defect\u201d. This also allows them to legally sidestep claims, although lawyers say that when cases reach court the airline is usually unable to supply adequate proof. \u201cApproximately 79% of the claims are immediately rejected, yet when we take a claim to court we win 98% of the time, even in the case of technical errors,\u201d said Raymond Veldkamp of the claims firm Flight-Delayed. But he added: \u201cThis judgment still leaves room for interpretation and as we\u2019ve seen with previous smaller judgments, airlines are incredibly creative.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The temptation is to think that, just because a deal has been rumoured for ages, it\u2019s bound to happen. In the case of Anheuser-Busch Inbev\u2019s plan to buy SABMiller to form a $275bn brewing colossus, most of the City seems to have rushed to that conclusion. The \u201cMegaBrew\u201d is likely to come into being, the analysts almost all agree, as they draft their debt and leverage calculations and price up the parts of SAB that AB Inbev would be obliged by competition authorities to sell. The arithmetic works if SAB rolls over at about \u00a339-\u00a344 a share, runs the general thinking. Maybe they\u2019re right, and maybe that\u2019s the way the plot will run. Ultimately, though, most of the power lies in only two hands \u2013 Altria, spun out of the old Philip Morris, which owns 26% of SAB; and the Colombian Santo Domingo family, which has 14%. Both parties\u2019 thinking is a complete mystery to outsiders. But one can make a few points. First, Altria and the Santo Domingos have been long-term holders of SAB and showed no inclination to reduce their holdings when the share price reached \u00a337 in March. Before AB Inbev made its approach, the price had slipped to \u00a330 because of the wobbles in emerging markets. But the two big investors may be happy to bet that China and Asia will bounce back in short order, restoring SAB\u2019s value. In that case, even an offer of, say, \u00a344 a share, wouldn\u2019t look terribly generous from a long-term perspective \u2013 the takeover premium would be a miserly 19% if one takes \u00a337 as the \u2018base\u201d price. Second, if AB Inbev\u2019s offer includes a heavy helping of its own shares \u2013 the most likely formula \u2013 Altria and the Colombians would want to be confident that the acquirer can make the purchase work. AB Inbev has a superb record as a buyer, of course, but there is equally an argument that a takeover of SAB would be one drink too many; the regulatory hurdles alone make it complex. Maybe, the two big shareholders might prefer SAB\u2019s lower-risk model. Third, Altria and Santo Domingo might salivate at AB Inbev\u2019s potential cost-savings but conclude the deal is best done at a later date. It would be a reasonable argument if you believe SAB\u2019s portfolio of businesses in emerging markets offers better medium-term growth. To repeat: until AB Inbev puts its cards on the table, everything is guess-work. But, on the face of it, there is no reason for SAB\u2019s investors to fold for less than \u00a345 a share, which may be more than AB Inbev is willing to offer. Pfizer/AstraZenceca, remember, was \u201cinevitable\u201d until it wasn\u2019t. Strong language by City standards Naughty, naughty. Glencore committed \u201ca serious breach of shareholder protection principles,\u201d in this week\u2019s \u00a31.6bn placing, says the Investment Association and the National Association of Pension Funds, the UK\u2019s two big fund management bodies. The language is strong by City standards, rightly so. First, so-called pre-emption rights \u2013 designed to protect shareholders against management teams who might try to issue shares to their chums \u2013 are important. Second, Glencore knew what it was doing. In May, the company won permission to issue up to 9.99% of its share capital without applying pre-emption rights, but only under specific circumstances \u2013 if making an acquisition or funding a specific investment. In the event, Glencore needed the money to reduce borrowings but simply announced it would ignore what it had been agreed because it was \u201cin the interests\u201d of the company. As it happens, Glencore\u2019s probably had a half-decent argument, if only it had been bothered to make it formally. It needed the cash quickly and delay could have been costly, thus a placing was better than a rights issue. And, it might be argued, nobody seriously lost out via the placing because the new shares were issued within a whisker of the market price. But saying that you\u2019ll do one thing in May, and then doing another in September, should be a serious no-no for a FTSE 100 company. Surely the shareholders should get a say on what\u2019s in a company\u2019s best interests. Thus the IA\u2019s and NAPF\u2019s other beef is that Glencore didn\u2019t pick up the phone and make its case. \u201cMost importantly, there is no evidence of any suitable consultation with existing shareholders,\u201d they say. \u201cThis sets a very damaging precedent for market practices.\u201d Fair comment. Ultimately, however, the moral of the tale is depressing: fund managers can scream and shout about their pre-emption rights but, on this occasion, the only penalty is an angry press release. Every Lidl bit helps Almost a third of independent shareholders last week voted against the reappointment of Keith Hellawell as chairman of Sports Direct. The doubters probably won\u2019t be reassured by an interview in Thursday\u2019s Daily Mail in which Hellawell disputes that it his job to hold Mike Ashley, founder and 55% shareholder, to account. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely at a loss as this is not a conflict situation. His interests are aligned with the company,\u201d says Hellawell. That\u2019s just obtuse. Ashley, it is true, has a large and direct interest in Sports Direct\u2019s prosperity, so he\u2019s definitely aligned. But this does not mean that the chairman is obliged to go along with madcap ideas such as Sports Direct taking a punt on Tesco shares via a put-option agreement with Goldman Sachs. As for Hellawell\u2019s apparent bafflement about why the company gets so much attention over its use of zero-hours contracts, come on, it\u2019s simple: the contracts may be legal but the employment market would be a very different place if everybody used them as enthusiastically as Sports Direct. Every Lidl bit helps Lidl\u2019s decision to give all its workers a pay rise, taking hourly rates beyond the government\u2019s definition of a living wage, should take some of the wind of grumbling retailers\u2019 sails about enforced pay hikes. Lidl is a successful company, of course, and is expanding at rapid pace. But it is still far from being the biggest player in town. If it can pay at least \u00a39.35 an hour in London and \u00a38.20 elsewhere, the bulk of the high street should be able to go higher.",

      "bodyText": "Lidl has said it will pay 9,000 of its UK workers at least the full living wage from next month as the first major high street name to embrace the higher pay campaign. The German-owned supermarket chain said the move represented an average pay rise of \u00a31,200 per year for thousands of staff, with all UK employees receiving at least \u00a38.20 an hour in England, Scotland and Wales and at least \u00a39.35 in London. It currently pays \u00a37.30 an hour outside London and \u00a38.03 in London. The 14% average pay rise, costing \u00a39m, will take minimum pay at Lidl past the level recommended by the Living Wage Foundation, which campaigns for companies to pay staff enough to meet the cost of living. The foundation recommends paying \u00a37.85 outside London and \u00a39.15 in London and will announce new rates at the start of November. Lidl said it would match the foundation\u2019s new levels if they were higher than those adopted by the company. The foundation\u2019s living wage is distinct from and higher than the \u201cnational living wage\u201d announced by George Osborne in his July budget. The chancellor said the minimum wage, now \u00a36.50 an hour, would be renamed and increased to \u00a37.20 an hour from April, rising to more than \u00a39 in 2020. Lidl said more than half its 17,000 UK workers would benefit from the pay increase and that its move would cover employees of all ages, unlike Osborne\u2019s scheme which applies to workers aged over 25. Ronny Gottschlich, Lidl UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt\u2019s only right that we show our commitment, in the same way that the team commit to the business and our customers each and every day, by ensuring a wage that supports the cost of living. As a result, Lidl employees will be among the best paid in the supermarket sector, and that\u2019s something I feel incredibly proud about.\u201d Years of falling real wages after the financial crisis, and the realisation that the government was topping up low pay through the benefits system, have increased pressure on employers to pay decent wages. Campaigners have targeted the annual meetings of big retailers such as Next, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco to demand adoption of the living wage. Sainsbury\u2019s increased its standard rate for shopfloor staff by 4% to \u00a37.36 an hour this month. Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said Lidl\u2019s adoption of the living wage was significant because it could put pressure on hitherto reluctant retailers to pay the living wage. Moore said: \u201cLidl\u2019s announcement is a massive breakthrough in the living wage campaign, and proves that paying staff a real living wage, calculated around the cost of living, is possible on the British high street. \u201cIt sets a challenge to the rest of the UK supermarket sector, that has until now claimed that paying staff the living wage was just not possible. Consumers can now genuinely make a living wage choice at the checkout.\u201d Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, has predicted that supermarkets, which each employ many thousands of low-paid staff, would either have to cut jobs or increase prices to deal with Osborne\u2019s plan. Manpower, the recruiter, has said the new rate has sent shockwaves through the labour market. More than 1,700 employers are accredited by the Living Wage Foundation, including almost a quarter of the FTSE 100 and big names such as Nestl\u00e9 and Chelsea FC. The only accredited national high street retailer is Oliver Bonas, the fashion and jewellery chain with 44 stores. Burberry has also adopted the living wage and Ikea has pledged to pay it to its 9,000 employees from April. The foundation said it hoped Lidl would become an accredited employer to underline its commitment. Accredited companies promise to pay the living wage as it increases and to include contract staff such as cleaners as well as permanent employees. Lidl said the company had not taken a decision on accreditation but that cleaners and other workers at stores and other Lidl premises are permanent employees. She added: \u201cAt this stage our focus is on our employees and ensuring that the rollout is seamless. We feel confident that the Living Wage Foundation will welcome this announcement.\u201d The top 12 living wage employers (by staff) Royal Bank of Scotland HSBC Barclays Centrica Santander SSE PwC Nationwide Aviva GlaxoSmithKline Deloitte KPMG",

    "webTitle": "Federal Reserve puts rate rise on hold - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "We are going to wrap up this live blog, but first here is a quick summary of what happened today: The last time Fed raised interest rates was in 2006 It turns out that the economists surveyed by WSJ were right, when 54% of them predicted that the Federal Reserve will wait to raise rates Federal Reserve will not raise rates this month Yellen said rates could be raised at the meeting to be held in October, despite the fact that there is no press conference scheduled for that meeting at this time The reasons why the Federal Reserve is not raising rates just yet are concerns about fragile economy (Thanks, China!) and the low US inflation rate The Fed would like the US inflation to be closer to 2% Potential government shut down played no role in the Fed\u2019s decision Bernie Sanders and AFL-CIO praised Fed\u2019s decision to hold off on raising the rates The markets stumbled a little after the decision, ending the days just slightly below where they started: Dow Jones was down 0.39%, S&amp;P 500 was down 0.26% and Nasdaq was up 0.1% The FTSE 100 index (the largest blue-chip companies listed in London) fell by 42 points, or 0.7% The US markets have just closed. Here is where they were at: MarketWatch also pointed out that \u201cseveral emerging-markets currencies, including the Mexican peso, Malaysian ringgit and Korean won, traded higher than the dollar after Federal Reserve policy makers left interest rates unchanged Thursday\u201d. Vermont Senator and 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had released a statement praising the Fed\u2019s decision. In it, he says: It is good news that the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates today. At a time when real unemployment is over 10%, we need to do everything possible to create millions of good-paying jobs and raise the wages of the American people. It is now time for the Fed to act with the same sense of urgency to rebuild the disappearing middle class as it did to bail out Wall Street banks seven years ago. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka echoed similar sentiments in his statement. AFL-CIO is the largest federation of unions in the US. We are pleased that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged. We know the economic recovery still has not reached working families and even a small increase can have devastating effects on our economic stability. The Federal Reserve is wise to not raise interest rates while inflation is running low and wages are flat. Real wages need to rise with productivity. We hope the Fed will now dedicate its time to producing economic policies that work for all and raise wages to a level that can sustain a family. An out of balance economy that exacerbates the incredible income inequality we see in this country must be fixed to strengthen our families and communities. My colleague Rupert Neate has written a news story about today\u2019s decision. He points out that not all members of the Fed committee agree about when to raise interest rates. The Fed\u2019s decision was not unanimous \u2013 as it normally is \u2013 with Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Fed\u2019s Atlanta regional bank, casting a vote for an increase. Lacker had pushed for the Fed to begin raising rates by moving the federal funds rate up by a quarter-point. Rates are still expected to be raised this year, with 13 of the 17-member committee predicting that the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) will raise rates by at least 0.25 percentage points. However, four policymakers believe that rates should not be raised until at least 2016, including one who pushed out until 2017. In June only two members felt the rate hike should be left unchanged until 2016. The conference has now wrapped up. In the last few minutes, Yellen answered the following questions: Is Fed contributing to financial inequality in the US? \u201cThe main thing that an accommodative monetary policy does is put people back to work,\u201d says Yellen. \u201cIncome inequality is surely exacerbated by high unemployment and a weak job market.\u201d Did the possibility of government shutdown affect the Fed\u2019s decision? No, it played no role in the decisions, says Yellen, pointing out that that\u2019s Congress\u2019s job. \u201cI believe it\u2019s the responsibility of Congress to pass a budget to fund the government and to deal with the debt ceiling so that America pays its bills,\u201d she says. For Congress to endanger the progress that the US economy has made so far \u201cwould be more than unfortunate\u201d, says Yellen. Could US be stuck in zero-interest rates loop? Not really, says Yellen. \u201cI can\u2019t completely rule it out but really that\u2019s an extreme downside risk that in no way is near the center of my outlook,\u201d she says. Yellen says that statements of the Federal Open Market Committee members have been parsed for clues as to what the Fed is planning. It is an \u201cunfortunate state of affairs\u201d, she says. Here is a look at what happened to the S&amp;P 500 today when the Fed announced its decision: Yellen says that slowing in China\u2019s economy has long been expected and that \u201cthere are no surprises there\u201d. \u201cDevelopments we saw in financial markets in August partly reflected concerns of downside risk to Chinese economic performance and the deftness with which policymakers are addressing those concerns,\u201d says Yellen. When it comes to markets turbulence, Yellen says they are not responding to it but are analyzing it. \u201cThe Fed should not be responding to up and downs in the markets. It certainly is not our policy to do so,\u201d she says, adding that the Fed does ask what is causing these ups and downs. \u201cWe expect inflation to move back to 2%,\u201d says Yellen. Energy prices have created a drag on inflation, but she views it as transitory. \u201cIn the meantime, the labor market has continued to improve\u201d and is moving closer to full employment which creates upward pressure on inflation, says Yellen. \u201cWe\u2019d like to have a little bit more confidence,\u201d she adds, noting that as labor market improves it helps bolster that confidence. Yellen says that October remains a possibility for interest rate hike, despite that month\u2019s meeting currently being scheduled with no press briefing. Every meeting is a meeting where the committee can make a decision, says Yellen. She adds that if the Fed were to raise interest rates in October, it would than call a press briefing. \u201cThe situation abroad bears watching,\u201d Yellen says before noting that economic recovery at home has advance at a sufficient rate than an argument could be made for raising interest rates. \u201cThe economy has been performing well and we expect it to do so.\u201d She says that the decision to raise rates will not be based on any specific data. The monthly jobs report just got even more important. Yellen has just clearly pegged any rate rise to further improvements in the labor market. \u201cWhen it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2% objective over the medium term.\u201d Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is prompt, starting the conference at 2:30 pm. You can watch it here: Yellen points out that wage growth is still subdued and that inflation remains short of the Fed\u2019s 2% goal. For a moment there, the markets stumbled but are now right back up. Fed Up campaign, which has spent the last month lobbying the Fed to not raise the interest rates just yet, is definitely happy with today\u2019s decision. Here is a statement from Ady Barkan, campaign director for Fed Up: This is a victory for the working families who stepped up with innovative organizing to send the Fed a clear message: Our voices belong in the debate about our economy. With the recovery still far too weak in too many communities, it would have been economically devastating \u2013 and immoral \u2013 to slow the economy. We applaud Chair Yellen and the Federal Reserve for resisting the pressure being put on them to intentionally slow down the economy. Weak wage growth proves that the labor market is still very far from full employment. And with inflation still below the Fed\u2019s already low target, there is simply no reason to raise interest rates anytime soon. Across America, working families know that the economy still has not recovered. We hope that the Fed continues to look at the data and refrain from any rate hikes until we reach genuine full employment for all, particularly for the Black and Latino communities who are being left behind in this so-called recovery. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, writes that today\u2019s decision is \u201cmerely a temporary forestalling of the inevitable\u201d and that the speculations will now shift to December. The decision will be seen by many as appropriate. Although the domestic economy appears to be in sound health, current worries about slowing growth outside of the US, notably China, and recent financial market turmoil meant the Fed decided on balance that it\u2019s not a good time for the first US rate hike in almost a decade. But the lack of action leaves lingering uncertainty about the outlook for US policymaking, which will no doubt fuel further volatility in the markets. Here is what the Fed is likely to look for in the coming weeks and months: further robust non-farm payroll growth whether the economic growth will continue despite China\u2019s slowdown According to Williamson, \u201cin the absence of any serious derailing of the economy, rates will rise before the year is out\u201d since then it would be difficult for the Fed to again argue that a rate hike is not warranted. Here is AP\u2019s quick-analysis of the Fed\u2019s decision: The Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates at historic lows for at least another month. Pressure had been building as to when the US central bank would hike rates from near-zero after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in congressional testimony that it would likely be later this year. But Fed officials held off Thursday after a two-day meeting because inflation is running well below their 2% objective and \u201crecent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat.\u201d It\u2019s extremely rare for Fed officials in their statement to highlight the risks posed by foreign economies. This means that they\u2019re carefully monitoring the aftershocks from a slowdown in China and other emerging markets, in addition to struggles by Europe to increase economic growth. Fed officials meet again in October and December. Here is an excerpt from the statement: To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 % target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2% objective over the medium term. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee\u2019s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The consensus on Financial Twitter seems to be that Fed will hold ... With a little over ten minutes to go till Federal Reserve announces whether it will or will not raise rates, there has been little reaction from the US markets. Here is a quick rundown of what else has happened so far: The last time Fed raised interest rates was in 2006 Earlier today, the Philadelphia Fed\u2019s monthly manufacturing index, which tracks conditions in the region, fell short of forecasts. It dropped to minus 6.0 from plus 8.3. The FTSE 100 index (the largest blue-chip companies listed in London) fell by 42 points, or 0.7%. The WSJ\u2019s Survey of Economists shows that 46% think the Fed will raise rates today; 54% predict they will wait. Reminder: you can watch the 2:30 pm press conference here. Here is a quick look where the markets stand right now: There are about 40 minutes left till the big reveal. It seems that some people are experiencing a bout of Bernanke melancholy. (Ben Bernanke was Yellen\u2019s predecessor.) Jim Cramer, host of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and a co-founder of TheStreet, said this morning that with Bernanke Fed \u201cwe would have know for a long time what\u2019s gonna happen\u201d. We wouldn\u2019t have this uncertainty. We wouldn\u2019t be frozen. The Yellen Fed is just a bunch of people, a cacophony of voices and maybe she reaches some conclusion. I think a black box Fed we\u2019ve been talking about it really bad for both corporate America and for, yes, financial America, for stocks. And that\u2019s worrisome. I really don\u2019t like the fact that I actually have to care and know what will happen. But boy, do you ever have to know it. Cramer went on to say that even average men and women on the street are concerned. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this in ages,\u201d he said. Zuccotti is not the only place that is seeing some action today - some protesters have also gone to the Fed. They have been spotted holding signs calling for good jobs and full employment. In August, the US unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%, which according to some Fed officials means that the labor market is approaching full employment. \u201cDoes \u2018full employment\u2019 include communities of color?\u201d one of the signs asked today. Back in July, when Yellen testified before the US Congress she said she is greatly concerned with rising inequality and the impact it had on African Americans and their unemployment, but that there was little she could do about it. We don\u2019t have the tools to be able to address the structure of unemployment across groups, but a stronger economy generally really does tend to be beneficial to all Americans and that\u2019s what we are working towards. Here is another reminder of how long it\u2019s been since the Fed last raised interest rates in 2006: Today, 17 September, also marks four years since Occupy Wall Street took over Zuccotti Park in New York. Back in 2011, the movement tried to draw attention to issues like financial inequality, government spending, healthcare costs and the problem of student debt. To mark their 4th anniversary, some of the activists are returning to Zuccotti today for another day of action. My colleague Suzanne McGee had a piece of advice for the Fed this morning: raise the rates already. [T]he truth may be that there\u2019s no such thing as the perfect time for the Fed to act, but that the more policymakers stall, the more other, less evident dangers will become more significant. At some point the Fed must step in and raise rates \u2013 unless it chooses to simply abdicate this role altogether \u2013 and delaying the inevitable may actually create more risk than taking that first small step. Hello, Jana here, coming at you live from New York, where some traders are apparently passing around Yellen\u2019s horoscope. Yellen, whose birthday is in August, is a Leo. \u201cYou\u2019re the missing piece of the puzzle today, Leo. As a result, people will look you you for answers. The good news is that you\u2019ll have them at the ready.\u201d There are just two hours to go until the most eagerly anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate decision in many a year, so I\u2019m handing over to Jana Kasperkevic in New York. Goodbye from London, and enjoy the show..... GW You can get up to speed on tonight\u2019s FOMC meeting with our comprehensive Q&amp;A, by Katie Allen: Another reminder of how much has changed since the Federal Reserve last raised rates. After a anxious day, Europe\u2019s stock markets have just closed. Now traders must simply wait for the FOMC decision. The FTSE 100 index (the largest blue-chip companies listed in London) fell by 42 points, or 0.7%, to extend its recent zig-zag pattern: Alastair McCaig, Senior Market Analyst at City firm IG, says that European stock markets resembled \u201crabbits caught in headlights\u201d today. There\u2019s a feeling that tonight\u2019s decision could be \u201cmuch ado about nothing\u201d, McCaig adds, with some financial institutions now looking to December for the first hike. Central bankers such as Janet Yellen have put lots of effort into reassuring the markets that the first rate hike isn\u2019t a huge event. The most important thing is the future path of borrowing costs, not exactly when the first rise comes, they argue. But despite that, analysts at Capital Economics believes that the US bond markets could be \u201crattled\u201d. They say: This is not because we expect tighter monetary policy to drive credit spreads a lot higher \u2013 again, this has not tended to happen in the past. Rather it is largely because we think that the Fed will raise the federal funds rate faster and further than discounted in the Treasury market over the next year or two. A rate hike, when it comes, is going to be a new experience for millions of financial workers worldwide. Anyone who got their first job on Wall Street since 2009 (or in the City of London, Frankfurt, Tokyo or Shanghai for that matter) has only ever known record low interest rates. They\u2019ve never had to analyse companies, predict bond spreads or FX moves in an era where the world\u2019s most important central bank is tightening policy. It\u2019s going to be a learning curve.... Three hours to go until the Fed announces its decision. Janet Yellen will then hold a press conference, 30 minutes later (at 2.30pm EDT or 7.30am BST). The International Monetary Fund\u2019s chief spokesman, Gerry Rice, has declined to comment on tonight\u2019s decision. We respect the independence of the Fed, Rice tells reporters. Yes, that\u2019s the same IMF which recommended last week that central banks maintain an \u201caccommodative monetary stance\u201d, as global economic growth looks disappointing. The Washington Post\u2019s Ylan Q. Mui reminds us how much has changed since 2006, the last time US interest rates were raised. (and for UK readers, Alastair Cook had just played his first test match for England) On the other hand, the Philly Fed is just one more data point.... The Philadelphia Federal Reserve has JUST delivered a blow to hopes of a rate hike today. The Philadelphia Fed\u2019s monthly manufacturing index, which tracks conditions in the region, has fallen short of forecasts, dropping to minus 6.0 from plus 8.3. That shows factory activity in the mid-Atlantic area is contracting this month. Activity in the sector may have suffered from recent volatility in the stock market and international news reports, the Philly Fed suggests. This is the first negative reading since February 2014, and the lowest since February 2013. A big miss, just as the FOMC is wondering whether to raise borrowing costs. It\u2019s the second survey this week to suggest the US factory sector is in a soft patch, after the Empire State report yesterday. Some analysts reckon it lowers the chances of an interest rate rise today. Nearly seven years of record low interest rates have meant fallow times for savers. With hindsight, they should have bought shares in tech firms like Amazon, Apple and Netflix instead. JP Morgan analysts like the look of today\u2019s US jobless report (covered an hour ago) The S&amp;P 500 index has fallen by 0.1% in early New York trading. One stock stands out - Cablevision shares jumped by over 15%, after European telecoms company Altice Group announced a $17.7bn takeover deal. A very cautious open on Wall Street has seen the Dow Jones industrial average dip by 0.25%. The Dow is down 38 points at 16,701 at pixel time. Wall Street is feeling the calm before the storm..... Private equity magnate David Rubenstein, the founder of The Carlyle Group, made himself a billionaire by reading the markets. And he says the Fed will not raise interest rates this month. Speaking on CNBC, Rubenstein argues that the Fed will wait until investors expect a hike before acting. As he put it: \u201cThe Fed is really the central bank of the world. If the Fed raise rates a little bit, it will have an impact all over the world, particularly in emerging markets. \u201cI think the Fed is sensitive to that, and I think therefore the Fed is likely to wait for another month or two to get additional data and probably telegraph a little bit better than it has now that it\u2019s about ready to do it at a particular time.\u201d Rubenstein is right that the markets aren\u2019t expecting a hike (it\u2019s a 32% chance, \u2018pparently). Another gobbet of US economic data -- the number of new housing starts fell by 3% in August. However the number of building permits -- giving permission to construct a new house -- increased by 3.5% during the month, suggesting the market remains quite robust. Here\u2019s something for the Fed to chew on. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefit has hit an eight week low, down by 11,000. The initial claims total dropped to 264,000 last week, data just released shows, down from 275,000. That\u2019s the lowest level since mid July, and suggests the US labour market remains robust. I\u2019m not sure how much attention Janet Yellen pays to Twitter. But if she\u2019s lurking, she should check out the #chartsforJanet hashtag for some helpful advice on today\u2019s decision: Reuters has caught up with one of the economists who will be smiling if Janet Yellen announces a rate hike today, but blushing if she doesn\u2019t. Here\u2019s a flavour: \u201cI joke to colleagues, do I still have a job on Friday if I get it wrong on Thursday?\u201d says Citigroup\u2019s William Lee, adding that no, his pay will not be cut if he blows the call. Citi goes with a Fed hike and Lee said that investors read research from banks to \u201cstress test\u201d their positions; for that reason, even if he is right that the Fed raises rates but gets the why wrong, \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed.\u201d If he gets the rate call wrong, he will dissect what he might have missed. I suspect Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group speaks for many in the City today, after months of speculation about today\u2019s FOMC meeting. We\u2019re not expecting any early drama when Wall Street opens in 90 minutes time. The futures markets shows the Dow falling just 10 points at the open, to 16,729. Nour Al-Hammoury, chief market strategist at ADS Securities in Abu Dhabi, says: The long awaited Fed meeting is finally here, but if the Federal reserve delays the hike again their creditability is on the line, but we do not think this is enough of a reason for them to raise rates. We are looking for a hold with no change in the current policy, but with an option for the hike in either October or December. Back to the Federal Reserve.... and Bloomberg has pulled together a handy guide to the challenge facing the US central bank today. If they don\u2019t raise rates today, then it creates the \u201cYellen Put\u201d -- the notion that the Fed chief will cave in whenever investors get jittery. That\u2019s not good for credibility, and also risks losing the chance to raise rates gradually. So they should hike? Not so fast! An ill-timed rate rise can hurt the global economy, and suggest the Fed isn\u2019t taking its mandate on inflation seriously Once the Federal Reserve meeting is over tonight, the financial markets can return to fretting about Greece. And three days before crucial Greek elections, polls this morning are indicating that Sunday\u2019s vote is going to be the tightest of ballots. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The race to find a stable government that can navigate debt-crippled Greece through its worst economic crisis in decades just seems to be getting tighter and tighter. Throughout the four weeks that have preceded this \u201cexpress\u201d election, surprise has been the dominating force. Nothing has gone quite to plan, either for leftwing former prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party or his conservative challenger New Democracy. For the former (if polls are to be believed) the result has been disappointing; for the latter much brighter than perhaps even New Democrats would have believed. A new survey conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday this week by Kapa Research and published in today\u2019s Vima gives Syriza the lead but at 0.6% shows the gap between Syriza and New Democracy narrowing even further. Similarly, Tsipras has the edge over his conservative challenger Vangelis Meimarakis \u2013 but only just. The poll showed that while 36.5% thought him more suitable for the post of prime minister, 35.1% also favoured Meimarakis \u2013 until recently no force to be reckoned with on the political scene. Once again, the neo-fascist Golden Dawn came in third with 6.7% followed by the socialist democrat Pasok with 5.9%, the communist KKE party with 5.5%, the centrist Potami with 5% and the breakaway far left Popular Unity with 3.5%. The Independent Greeks party (Anel), Tsipras\u2019 junior party in government has voter support of 3% in the poll \u2013 just enough to cross the threshold and get into the 300-seat parliament. The findings show that crisis-plagued Greece is in for a ride \u2013 despite the voter fatigue which also appears to be the other dominant factor in this election. The stability the country so desperately needs to nourish the political certainty that will allow it to implement the measures \u2013 set as the price of being bailed out to the tune of \u20ac86bn for a third time since 2009 - may prove to be elusive. Politicians were at pains today to insist that a re-run was out of the question. \u201cThere is definitely not going to be a second round of elections,\u201d the former Syriza economy minister Giorgos Stathakis told Skai TV. But with no party set to win a majority and Tsipras ruling out a coalition with New Democracy \u2013 forming a government could well be hard. The undecided, says, analysts will play a crucial role but so, too, will those who have vowed to abstain. Such is the worry over the latter that Syriza \u2013 now focusing on first-time voters and women, the majority of undecided \u2013 has rolled out posters imploring voters to cast ballots. \u201cNo apohi\u201d, it says, using the Greek word for abstention, adding: \u201cAs long as you abstain others make plans against you.\u201d The Greek electorate is tired \u2013 tired of crisis and tired of the policy options offered by politicians. A glimmer of good news has been spied in Greece, ahead of Sunday\u2019s election. Fewer than one in four adults are officially unemployed, for the first time in over three years: Money has already been flowing out of emerging markets and into the stock markets of advanced economies, in anticipation of higher US interest rates: Just 32%. That\u2019s the market-implied probability that America gets its first interest rate rise since 2006 today. So there could be wild moves if the Fed does hike, as it would not be \u2018priced in\u2019. City investors are adopting a classic \u201chold-off-and-see\u201d stance ahead of tonight\u2019s Fed decision, says Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. Mike adds: This announcement is all the more important given its potential to include the first rate hike in a decade, signalling the beginning of the end of extraordinarily cheap money and exit from \u2018crisis\u2019 mode. The US dollar has weakened a little this morning, down 0.3% against the euro to $1.1327. That suggests traders are pricing in \u2018no change\u2019 from the Fed tonight. Brazil, Russia, Turkey and South Africa have most to fear from a US interest rate hike, says rating agency Moody\u2019s in a new report. It argues that America\u2019s economy could handle a small (0.25%) rise in borrowing costs, but several emerging nations would struggle if their currencies weakened. Here\u2019s the highlights: If the US Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates by 25bps, Moody\u2019s does not anticipate a significant impact on interest rates or currencies in developed countries. Direct impact the US economy from a rate hike will be minimal as the Fed funds rate will rise by only a likely quarter of a point, and further rises will be very gradual. Any rise in borrowing costs will also be minimal, but short-term T-notes, T-bills may go up modestly. The impact of a US rate hike on emerging markets will vary. Some have already anticipated a Fed action and have seen large drops in their exchange rates. Currency depreciation does bode well for exports, but can provoke turbulence in financial markets, therefore affecting overall growth. The countries most at risk going forward include Brazil, Russia, Turkey and to some extent South Africa, where severe domestic challenges have contributed to exchange rate and financial market instability, and where policy room to buffer external shocks and protect growth is less robust. With nine hours until the biggest Fed decision in years, Europe\u2019s main stock markets are all subdued. The FTSE 100, German Dax and French CAC are all in the red, with investors reluctant to take big positions before tonight\u2019s drama. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, reports that trading is quiet. The jury remains out as to whether Janet Yellen and her team will be able to push through a rate hike, with yesterday\u2019s downturn in US inflation data being the latest roadblock, but it seems inevitable that if policymakers across the Atlantic do hike rates then equity markets globally will be in for a rough end to the week. We already have one central bank decision, and it\u2019s a no change. The Swiss National Bank has left interest rates pegged at between minus 0.25% and minus 1.25%, but warned it could take action to weaken the swiss franc, if needed. Switzerland introduced negative interest rates last December, to combat the surge of capital into its economy that was pushing the franc uncompetitively high against the euro. Bloomberg has surveyed 113 economists, and a narrow majority predicted the Fed will not raise rates today. Bloomberg\u2019s Jon Ferro says the FOMC members must weigh up \u201cthe good, the bad and the complete unknown\u201d when they gather today. The good is the labour market, with the US unemployment rate dropping to just 5.1% in August. The bad is inflation. Data released yesterday showed that consumer prices grew by just 0.2% over the last 12 months, far from the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. And the unknown factor is the situation in the global economy, the potential ructions from China\u2019s slowdown as it rebalances its economy. Jon also points out that 15 central banks have hiked rates in the financial crisis, only to reverse course and cut (that includes the European Central Bank in 2011). Around half of the top economists in the City and on Wall Street will feel pretty smug when the Fed decision is announced. The other half may have some explaining to do. Reuters polled 80 economists from Europe and North America about today\u2019s decision; 45 predicted the Fed will hold, while 35 plumped for a hike. An earlier poll had shown a slight majority in favour of a rate rise, so it appears that the recent weakish economic data, and August\u2019s market turmoil, has prompted a rethink. Standard Chartered senior economist Thomas Costerg now expects the Fed to raise in December. Here\u2019s why: \u201cFed Chair Janet Yellen has been conspicuously silent, with no significant comments since July\u2019s congressional testimony.\u201d \u201cWe think the recent global market volatility \u2013 driven by ongoing concerns about global growth \u2013 has raised the bar for a first rate hike near-term.\u201d The Fed could potentially decide to leave interest rates unchanged, but make it very clear that a hike is coming soon. Alternatively, it could increase borrowing costs but then attempt to reassure investors that it will remain cautious. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, another French bank, explains: A clear message that a hike is \u2018on its way\u2019 is expected, so inaction today will likely only have a significant impact if the message is more dovish than that. A 25% rate hike would be a surprise to the market (though not to SG Economists) but the biggest surprise of all would be failure to lace any decision with dovish undertones. And looking ahead, Kit sees the US dollar rising, giving emerging markets another headache. The first reaction to the policy decision may not tell us much but over the coming months, a sluggish global economy, slowing growth in China and continued monetary policy divergence will dictate currency trends. There will be further downward pressure on commodities and commodity exporters\u2019 currencies and there will be further upward pressure on the dollar. French bank BNP Paribas predicts that the Fed will not raise interest rates today. Analyst Andrew MacFarlane explains (with some bonus US history thrown in): So we finally arrive at this most pivotal of days which is likely to have major implications around the world; yes, it is Constitution Day in the US, the annual celebration of that fateful day in 1787 when a committee of delegates signed the final draft in Philadelphia. It seems almost fitting that 228 years later, a committee of delegates will today meet at the Federal Reserve to discuss the future of the United States; let\u2019s just hope they don\u2019t have to make 27 amendments as well\u2026 BNP is calling for no change to rates, few changes in the policy statement, and a dovish set of economic and interest rate projections. There is a 30% chance that the Fed will raise interest rate tonight, according to the Fed funds futures market. That market, which allows investors to wager on rate moves, also shows that a majority expect rates to rise before Christmas. There\u2019s an edgy mood in Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning. Investors as nervous, as they simply don\u2019t know for sure which way Janet Yellen and her colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will jump tonight. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares has dipped by 12 points, or just 0.2%, in early trading. Here\u2019s the biggest fallers: Asian stock markets have risen today, on speculation that the Federal Reserve will resist the pressure to hike interest rates today. Angus Nicholson, of IG\u2019s Melbourne office, explains: Asian markets are doing well today in cautious positioning ahead of the Fed rates decision, with currency moves in particular reflecting the general feeling that rates will be left unchanged. The Korean Won, one of the most sold currencies in Asia, is having an impressive day, rising 0.6% against the US dollar. Japan\u2019s main stock index, the Nikkei, has closed 260 points higher at 18,432, Good morning. It\u2019s a historic day. Or rather, it might be. For the first time since the financial crisis began eight years ago, there\u2019s a genuine chance that America\u2019s central bank will take the plunge and raise interest rates today. The Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-making committee has an unenviably tricky task at today\u2019s meeting. Is the US economy strong enough to handle the first step towards more normal monetary policy? Or should they leave rates unchanged for yet another month, and repeat the suspense in October? We find out in almost 12 hours time -- at 7pm BST, or 2pm East Coast time. And investors across Europe\u2019s and Asia\u2019s financial markets are talking about little else. Borrowing costs have been pegged at their current record low of zero to 0.25% since December 2008. Rates haven\u2019t actually been raised since June 2006, so this really is a moment. Hawks on the committee can point to the US unemployment rate; now just 5.1%, the lowest since March 2008. But Doves can play the (low) inflation card -- prices actually fell by 0.2% month-on-month in August, suggesting little need to hike borrowing costs. Then there\u2019s the impact that a hike will have on the rest of the global economy. Higher US interest rates will drag capital out of emerging market economies which are already struggling to cope with weakening currencies. Plus there\u2019s the issue of China\u2019s slowdown, which could deliver a shock to the American economy in the months ahead. The Fed will be desperate to avoid losing credibility by raising rates now, only to cut them if the economy turns south in 2016. But equally, there\u2019s a danger of missing the moment, and having to hike more aggressively next year. A tough decision, which is why no-one really knows what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019ll be tracking all the build-up to the big decision through the day....",

This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2% objective over the medium term.</p> <p>The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee\u2019s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-17T18:03:25.004Z\">at 7.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55fafccae4b022a8812f2e4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-17T17:54:10.106Z\">6.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The consensus on Financial Twitter seems to be that Fed will hold ... </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CoryTV/statuses/644567715735314432\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash\">#Fed</a> doesn&#39;t want to tighten, it could cite Labor Force Participation. <a href=\"http://t.co/3hei4NAPKa\">http://t.co/3hei4NAPKa</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RawDoc?src=hash\">#RawDoc</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/h6Zw2OCXul\">pic.twitter.com/h6Zw2OCXul</a></p>&mdash; Cory Johnson (@CoryTV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoryTV/status/644567715735314432\">September 17, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FT/statuses/644568800956915716\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Larry Summers: This is not the time for a tightening in monetary policy <a href=\"http://t.co/E5JcWIWJ36\">http://t.co/E5JcWIWJ36</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash\">#Fed</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/bM77cykO6h\">pic.twitter.com/bM77cykO6h</a></p>&mdash; Financial Times (@FT) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FT/status/644568800956915716\">September 17, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RobinWigg/statuses/644568430822207489\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow, the 2-year Treasury yield thinks the Fed&#39;s gonna hold. <a href=\"http://t.co/OXqsJO6VAl\">pic.twitter.com/OXqsJO6VAl</a></p>&mdash; Robin Wigglesworth (@RobinWigg) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobinWigg/status/644568430822207489\">September 17, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55faf8b9e4b022a8812f2e3c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-17T17:47:10.365Z\">6.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">10 minutes and counting ...</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With a little over ten minutes to go till Federal Reserve announces whether it will or will not raise rates, there has been little reaction from the US markets. </p> <p>Here is a quick rundown of what else has happened so far: </p> <ul> <li>The last time Fed raised interest rates was in 2006<br></li> <li>Earlier today, the <strong>Philadelphia</strong><strong> Fed\u2019s</strong> monthly manufacturing index, which tracks conditions in the region, fell short of forecasts.

Nothing has gone quite to plan, either for leftwing former prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party or his conservative challenger New Democracy. For the former (if polls are to be believed) the result has been disappointing; for the latter much brighter than perhaps even New Democrats would have believed.</p> <p>A new survey conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday this week by Kapa Research and published in today\u2019s Vima gives Syriza the lead but at 0.6% shows the gap between Syriza and New Democracy narrowing even further. Similarly, Tsipras has the edge over his conservative challenger Vangelis Meimarakis \u2013 but only just. The poll showed that while 36.5% thought him more suitable for the post of prime minister, 35.1% also favoured Meimarakis \u2013 until recently no force to be reckoned with on the political scene. </p> <p>Once again, the neo-fascist <strong>Golden Dawn</strong> came in third with 6.7% followed by the socialist democrat <strong>Pasok</strong> with 5.9%, the communist <strong>KKE</strong> party with 5.5%, the centrist <strong>Potami</strong> with 5% and the breakaway far left <strong>Popular Unity</strong> with 3.5%. </p> <p>The Independent Greeks party (Anel), Tsipras\u2019 junior party in government has voter support of 3% in the poll \u2013 just enough to cross the threshold and get into the 300-seat parliament.</p> <p><strong>The findings show that crisis-plagued Greece is in for a ride \u2013 despite the voter fatigue which also appears to be the other dominant factor in this election. </strong></p> <p>The stability the country so desperately needs to nourish the political certainty that will allow it to implement the measures \u2013 set as the price of being bailed out to the tune of \u20ac86bn for a third time since 2009 - may prove to be elusive. Politicians were at pains today to insist that a re-run was out of the question. \u201cThere is definitely not going to be a second round of elections,\u201d the former Syriza economy minister Giorgos Stathakis told Skai TV. But with no party set to win a majority and Tsipras ruling out a coalition with New Democracy \u2013 forming a government could well be hard.</p> <p>The undecided, says, analysts will play a crucial role but so, too, will those who have vowed to abstain. Such is the worry over the latter that Syriza \u2013 now focusing on first-time voters and women, the majority of undecided \u2013 has rolled out posters imploring voters to cast ballots. </p> <p>\u201cNo apohi\u201d, it says, using the Greek word for abstention, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAs long as you abstain others make plans against you.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The Greek electorate is tired \u2013 tired of crisis and tired of the policy options offered by politicians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/statuses/644450876137033728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After Fed uncertainty put to bed this evening, thank goodness for weekend equally-difficult-to-call Greek election result to keep us amused</p>&mdash; Mike van Dulken (@Accendo_Mike) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Accendo_Mike/status/644450876137033728\">September 17, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-17T11:11:48.143Z\">at 12.11pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55fa997ae4b0b18640539daa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-17T10:45:32.642Z\">11.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A glimmer of good news has been spied in Greece, ahead of Sunday\u2019s election.

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve declined to raise interest rates from their record low of near-zero on Thursday, citing concerns that the still fragile world economy may \u201crestrain economic activity\u201d and further drag down already low inflation. While some economists had expected a rate rise \u2013 the first since 2006 \u2013 recent stock market turmoil in China and fears that a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy could dampen the global economy appear to have put off the decision for now. Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, said the central bank had maintained the federal funds rate at 0-0.25% \u2013 where it has been since the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 because of \u201cheightened concerns\u201d about a sharp slowdown in China and lower-than-desired inflation. She said the US recovery from \u201cthe great recession\u201d meant that there was an argument to be made for increasing rates \u2013 and the bank\u2019s poliycmakers had that argument today \u2013 but in the end they still needed more evidence that there was a sustained global recovery. \u201cRecent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term,\u201d the Fed said in a statement, following a two-day meeting of policymakers. The Fed said that while the US economy is almost balanced, it could be knocked of course by global developments and the central bank was closely \u201cmonitoring developments abroad\u201d. For months, economists had been expecting a rate rise (dubbed \u201cliftoff\u201d by Fed officials) at this meeting, but their enthusiasm has waned markedly following last month\u2019s global stock market panic over the health of the Chinese economy. The Fed repeated that there needs to be \u201csome further improvement in the labor market\u201d and to be \u201creasonably confident\u201d that inflation will increase before it can go ahead with an interest rate hike. Inflation is running well below their 2% objective and \u201crecent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat\u201d. The Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation was up just 1.2% in the latest reading and has been below 2% for more than three years. The Fed\u2019s decision was not unanimous \u2013 as it normally is \u2013 with Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Fed\u2019s Atlanta regional bank, casting a vote for an increase. Lacker had pushed for the Fed to begin raising rates by moving the federal funds rate up by a quarter-point. Rates are still expected to be raised this year, with 13 of the 17-member committee predicting that the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) will raise rates by at least 0.25 percentage points. However, four policymakers believe that rates should not be raised until at least 2016, including one who pushed out until 2017. In June only two members felt the rate hike should be left unchanged until 2016. While Yellen is not due to hold another press conference until December she said \u201cevery meeting is a live meeting\u201d, and that a rate increase was possible in October when the FOMC next meets. If the Fed decides to raise short-term rates at that point, it would call a press briefing, she said. Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG, said: \u201cClearly the Fed was worried about developments abroad and that was, at first blush, the primary reason why rates were not raised this month. This view is corroborated further by another addition later in the paragraph. After repeating that risks are nearly balanced, the Fed then said \u2018but is monitoring developments abroad\u2019. Clearly global developments are front and center.\u201d The median projection of the 17 policymakers showed the Fed expects the economy to grow 2.1% this year, slightly faster than previously thought. However, its forecasts for GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 were downgraded. An increase in rates will eventually lead to an increase in mortgage, car and personal loan and credit card rates in the US, and spark central banks throughout the rest of the developed world to also consider raising their interest rates. The Fed forecast that unemployment will drop to 5% by the end of this year, down from 5.3% in June. The unemployment rate in August dropped to a seven-year low of 5.1%. There was little reaction to the Fed\u2019s decision on Wall Street with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading up 0.2% at 16,775 \u2013 roughly where it had been before the announcement. However, bond investors seemed cheered by the Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates ultra-low. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.23% from 2.30%. Bond prices tend to rise and yields tend to fall when investors expect subdued inflation, low rates and modest economic growth. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWe now expect the fed funds rate to end this year at between 0.25-0.50%. But it is not implausible that some other \u2018risk\u2019 will emerge over the next few months (the debt ceiling is the most obvious candidate) that will convince the Fed to delay even longer. We now expect the fed funds rate to end next year at 2% rather than 2.38%. Nevertheless, we still anticipate that rising wage and price inflation next year will eventually force the Fed to tighten policy much more aggressively. The labour market is already close to full employment, it\u2019s only a matter of time. The longer the Fed delays now the higher interest rates will eventually have to go.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Around 1,700 top managers at brewer SABMiller could be in line for payouts averaging $1m (\u00a3650,000) each if the takeover of the business behind Grolsch and Peroni by Anheuser-Busch InBev goes ahead. Analysts at stockbroking firm Bernstein have calculated that share schemes put in place by the London-listed brewer will be worth more than $1.8bn (\u00a31.1bn) in total if the acquisition-hungry AB InBev pays around \u00a339 a share for its smaller rival. SABMiller\u2019s chief executive, Alan Clark, who took the helm two years ago and has worked for the brewer for 25 years, could receive substantially more. His options could be worth at least \u00a340m. Shares in SABMiller, which has a long heritage in South Africa dating back to 1886, closed at \u00a336.20 on Thursday, holding on to the 20% gains scored the previous day when AB InBev was forced to admit it had approached its smaller rival about a tie-up worth $275bn. At current prices SAB is worth around \u00a360bn. The prospect of the deal \u2013 the biggest takeover of the year to create a company being dubbed \u201cMegaBrew\u201d \u2013 has already been igniting the City. Big multimillion-pound fees are on offer for investment bankers working for SABMiller and Belgian-headquartered AB InBev. However, the focus has also begun to turn to the value of shares held by SABMiller staff, many of whom are outside the boardroom and based in South Africa. Trevor Stirling, analyst at Bernstein, calculated that if share schemes put in place at SABMiller were bought out by AB InBev at \u00a339 a share, staff stood to receive a combined $1.8bn. \u201cWe do not know the exact shape of the payout but we believe that there would be substantial multimillion-dollar payouts to level 2 managers,\u201d said Stirling. While AB InBev might try to put new five-year packages in place to stop them walking away, Stirling wrote: \u201cWe suspect very strongly that these newly affluent South Africans would not stick around to see what the culture of MegaBrew would be plus run the risk of being terminated during the five-year period and losing all the unvested stock.\u201d This might spark AB InBev \u2013 brewer of Stella Artois and Budweiser \u2013 to sell off some operations in parts of Africa to avoid the risk of staff defections. Other parts of the business would need to be broken off to calm concerns about monopoly positions in some countries. SAB\u2019s 58% stake in MillersCoors is expected to be sold off to Molson Coors, whose share price jumped in anticipation of a deal. The staff retention dilemma, however, may be less of an issue for those employees whose shares have already been released to them but remain inside the scheme because they have decided not to sell the stock. A deal could take months to complete, if it takes place at all. AB InBev \u2013 an acquisitive business run by Brazilian Carlos Brito \u2013 has until mid-October to make a formal offer under UK takeover rules, and it is not clear if he and South African Clark have held any formal discussions. Stirling expects the transaction, the subject of City gossip for many months, to complete. \u201cThis looks like the beginning of the end game in the formation of MegaBrew,\u201d he said. SABMiller, which employs 68,000 people around the world, refused to comment on the calculations. It is not clear if Clark would take any role in the enlarged company. But the South African could have shares worth around \u00a340m, including from options granted over 10 years ago, at the price of around \u00a339 per share expected by the City. In 2015 Clark received \u00a37m, including \u00a34.4m of long-term incentive plans on top of his \u00a31.1m salary. AB InBev is an amalgamation of businesses. Created in in 2008 by the merger of Anheuser-Busch, the American maker of Budweiser, and InBev, which itself was an amalgamation of Belgium\u2019s Interbrew, the owner of Stella Artois, and AmBev, the Brazilian maker of Brahma. It is controlled in turn by 3G Capital, a private equity fund run by a group of Brazilian investors which has been behind takeovers of Burger King, Heinz and Kraft Foods. The fund has pounced following a 15% fall in SABMiller\u2019s share price since August, when worries about the health of the Chinese economy \u2013 where it has large operations \u2013 knocked investor sentiment. Analysts at Bernstein point to a different structure at the two companies. SABMiller is more decentralised that AB InBev which is more \u201cfrugal\u201d than its target. \u201cFor instance, all levels of management in AB InBev travel in coach/economy unless transatlantic and even the CEO stays in modest hotels,\u201d the Bernstein analysts said.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of BHS has insisted the department store chain has enough cash to survive but warned it could take two to three years to turnaround the business. Darren Topp said it would be \u201chard bloody work\u201d to revitalise BHS but the controversial new owners of the high street retailer are \u201cincredibly supportive\u201d. Sir Philip Green, the retail tycoon, sold BHS for \u00a31 in March to a little-known collection of financiers, lawyers and accountants. Concerns about the future of the retailer, which employs more than 10,000 staff, have grown since then. It emerged that Dominic Chappell, who led the buyout, is a former bankrupt, that the new owners were considering closing 50 stores, and that credit insurers were refusing to support BHS\u2019s suppliers, meaning the retailer had to pay upfront for stock. However, Topp insisted BHS still has a place on the high street. \u201c100%,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have one million customers a week at the moment. That is a million reasons a week why we have got a place. \u201cWe are determined that we are going to turn this business back into that iconic British brand that certainly I remember as a child growing up. \u201cWe have always said this is a two- to three-year turnaround plan. We can\u2019t do it overnight. We are going to have to roll our sleeves up, it\u2019s going to be hard bloody work and we are going to have to spend some money in upgrading the estate. We are at the start of this plan.\u201d The BHS boss was speaking as the retailer unveiled a revamp of its shop in Watford, Hertfordshire. The retailer is refurbishing 20 of its 170 shops before Christmas. It is installing food departments into the stores, revamping the cafes and restaurants, and has modernised the layout of the clothing aisles with new mannequins and posters. The logo has also been overhauled so that the full name, British Home Stores, is used. BHS said earlier this week that it had secured a \u00a365m loan from London-based investment group Grovepoint Capital and now has \u00a385m of cash to fund operations. Topp insisted the retailer, which lost \u00a385m last year, now has the funds to rebuild. \u201cWe believe we can do it and we are determined to do it,\u201d said Topp, who has worked for BHS for six years and became chief executive in March. \u201cWe have got the cash to do what we need to do and we think we can get this business turned around. \u201cI think like most businesses we look at the next six months, the next 12 months, and we can see that we are fully funded. More importantly, we have got the cash to deliver the turnaround initiatives that we believe will start to bear fruit.\u201d When asked if that meant BHS only had funds for the next six months, he added: \u201cNo, no, no, beyond that. I think it would be unhelpful to give an end date. There are a lot of variables in there. The truth is we have got the cash to deliver the initiatives that we believe will turn the business around.\u201d Topp said that Chappell and his team at Retail Acquisitions, the vehicle he used to buy BHS, had been key to securing the new loan. However, he admitted that they \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything about them\u201d before the deal. \u201cThere is lots of stuff written about Dominic but the truth is I can only tell you as I\u2019ve found him - I\u2019ve found him incredibly supportive,\u201d Topp said. \u201cHe is determined to turn the business around, I think he has been a force for good in the business. He was instrumental in the refinancing, he led that. That is the kind of thing he does, and that is where he has been really helpful.\u201d Topp admitted that BHS is considering shutting stores but said the company had no plans to \u201cclose 60 in one go\u201d. He said: \u201cLike most retailers I have got a few at the bottom end that frankly look a bit ugly. Closure might be one of the options, but we might sublet, we might re-let, we might cut and carve them. \u201cWe will close some, I am sure. We have closed a handful every year for the last five or six years, but if you are saying to me are we going to close 60 in one go, no is the answer.\u201d BHS has appointed property agents Harper Dennis Hobbs and Jackson Criss to review the future of its flagship Oxford Street store. It is understood that BHS is considering splitting the shop into three parts and offloading two-thirds of the space to other retailers. Despite Topp\u2019s optimism, he admitted it was \u201ctricky\u201d trading without support from some credit insurers. \u201cThe key thing for me is that it has not stopped us buying any product that we want to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not stopped the business functioning. It\u2019s been tricky, but I have got some people offering insurance, some people not. It\u2019s been one of the challenges that we\u2019ve had, but the truth is that it hasn\u2019t stopped us doing anything that we wanted to do.\u201d",

The company paid the fine in order to avoid being criminally charged with scheming to conceal the fact that a fault with its ignition switch could lead to engines suddenly turning off and brakes being disabled. Preet Bharara, US attorney in Manhattan, said: \u201cFor nearly two years, GM failed to disclose a deadly safety defect to the public and its regulator.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "To raise, or not to raise? (Interest rates, that is.) That\u2019s the question that Federal Reserve policymakers were grappling with on Thursday \u2013 and economists betting on the outcome were pretty evenly divided. That was probably because world events once again made the Fed\u2019s decision a far, far less simple and straightforward matter than its chairman, Janet Yellen, clearly hoped it would be when she began sending out signals that September would mark the turning point. For context, the last time the Fed raised rates, in 2006, no one would have tweeted their decision \u2013 there was no Twitter. For that matter, smartphones were still nearly a year away. The Fed\u2019s decision to keep lending rates at nearly zero for almost seven years, in the aftermath of the financial crisis and the recession that followed, did the job: it helped save the US economy from collapse. Providing the financial system with virtually free money may not have been enough to restore the economy to its pre-crisis vigor, or save homes from foreclosure, or help all those who lost their jobs find new employment on the same terms. But there is a limit to what we can expect monetary policy, on its own, to accomplish. In the tense environment leading up to Thursday\u2019s meeting, an odd assortment of critics ranging from former treasury secretary Larry Summers to progressive nonprofit groups argued that this was precisely the wrong time to start making it more expensive to borrow money. China\u2019s economic turmoil, which has sparked a vast stock market selloff and risks creating a crisis of confidence in that country\u2019s government \u2013 a much more serious issue \u2013 has had ripple effects around the world, triggering tremendous volatility in the US market. Commodity prices have fallen sharply this year too: even the prices of the riskier kinds of bonds have been hit. These events could have given Fed policymakers a very welcome excuse to hit the \u201cpause\u201d button yet again, postponing a rate hike decision until at least their December meeting with the twin arguments that it is too risky to forge ahead in the uncertain market environment and that, anyway, emerging market turmoil has managed to take any steam or froth out of the US economy, reducing the danger it will overheat. Once again, the Fed could have a good set of events to point to and argue that it\u2019s still wiser to \u201cwait and see\u201d. But the truth may be that there\u2019s no such thing as the perfect time for the Fed to act, but that the more policymakers stall, the more other, less evident dangers will become more significant. At some point the Fed must step in and raise rates \u2013 unless it chooses to simply abdicate this role altogether \u2013 and delaying the inevitable may actually create more risk than taking that first small step. Consider what it is that we\u2019re talking about: an increase of 0.25% in the target rate of the Federal Funds rate, which currently is set in a range of zero to 0.25% \u2013 a level that at the time it was set was unprecedented in the central bank\u2019s history. While the US economy is not in full growth mode, its pace is a respectable 2.2% or so and seems to be stable. Unemployment has been cut in half from the levels recorded back in 2008. So if the Fed keeps interest rates at their crisis levels, what message will Yellen and co be sending to the public: that they have access to some kind of information that suggests the US economy is in worse shape that we are aware and thus more vulnerable to a rate hike, which they won\u2019t reveal? Or that they fear the changes that have followed as a result of this prolonged near-zero rate policy will make it impossible for them to manage the rate hikes as smoothly and gracefully as in days of yore? In Yellen\u2019s shoes, I wouldn\u2019t want to be sending either of those messages \u2013 especially when the central bank increasingly has been the target of muttering about a \u201ccredibility gap\u201d. Let them mutter, you say? Well, that\u2019s fine, until there\u2019s a run on the dollar and on dollar-denominated assets like stocks and bonds because global investors lose confidence in the Fed. Right now, the US is benefiting from being one of the strongest players in a still-weak global economy, but that won\u2019t always be the case and one of the factors that has kept the US in that position is the Fed\u2019s leadership. Of course, if a quarter-point rate hike would have a significant impact on the economy (and if that economy were fragile), this would be a very different discussion. But the impact is most likely to be psychological: the reversal \u2013 however well-telegraphed, infinitesimal and carefully orchestrated \u2013 of a policy that has been unchanged for seven years, taking place in a period of global economic uncertainty, is going to be jarring. So too, however, is leaving rates unchanged. Would the market volatility of the past several weeks have been as pronounced had the Fed already embarked on its rate-hike program, and put that source of uncertainty behind the market? I don\u2019t think so. Not knowing what the Fed will do and when it will do it \u2013 one of the very, very few factors that does lie within the control of policymakers \u2013 has been a source of unease and uncertainty for years. For proof, you just have to go back and take a look at the anxiety and volatility that has surrounded every Fed meeting and the release of every set of minutes from those meetings, anxiously scanned by economists, traders and investors looking for the minutest clues to the thinking of Yellen and her colleagues. That kind of Kremlinology is nothing new \u2013 once upon a time, when Alan Greenspan was spotted sneezing in the morning, rumors he had died would be rippling through trading desks by mid-afternoon, sending the bond market into a tailspin. But it\u2019s easy to put an end to such rumours with a single, small rate hike \u2013 and that move has some benefits, too. Firstly, it puts an end to all the longstanding speculation and uncertainty, and tells doubters that the Fed is taking control of the process. Secondly, it\u2019s a step back toward normalization \u2013 or at least, toward a new normal, whatever that ends up looking like. Thirdly, to the extent that market forces haven\u2019t done enough to shock us into awareness that there\u2019s a potentially nasty credit bubble lurking out there, the Fed can at least try to address it, rather than leaving it to its own devices. (By now, we should all know what havoc bubbles, left unattended, can wreak on financial markets and economies.) Ultimately, however, a small rate hike will give Yellen and her colleagues a bit of flexibility down the road. It removes the immediate pressure about whether to act (although if the global economic situation doesn\u2019t worsen in the coming months, the odds increase that we would see another rate hike by March). And if things do turn suddenly very sour, well, once again the Fed has some ability to manoeuver that it doesn\u2019t possess today, and that it had run out of by early 2009, when it had to turn to special bond-buying programs to stimulate the economy. It\u2019s much easier to simply unwind a rate increase than it is to put in place a complex multibillion-dollar bond-buying scheme. By 2pm ET, we\u2019ll all know which side of the fence Yellen and her fellow policymakers have landed on. At least until the time of their next meeting, in late October.",

Since then, other members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee have hinted that they too could soon be voting for the first increase in interest rates in more than eight years. The problem for these putative hawks is that the economic data does not suggest there is any need for policy to be tightened. Figures out this week showed inflation falling back to zero and unemployment rising. Now the Office for National Statistics has published figures for retail sales showing high street and online spending growing modestly for the second successive month. While growth in average annual earnings has picked up to 2.9% \u2013 its highest in six years \u2013 this is still low by pre-recession standards. More significantly, bigger pay packets do not seem to be translating into higher inflation. Consumers, judging by the retail sales numbers, are still reluctant to part with their money. There is no immediate threat of the economy relapsing into recession, although the combination of weaker factory output and the slowdown in retail activity means that growth in the third quarter is unlikely to match the 0.7% notched up in the second quarter. At this stage, the economy appears to be going through a soft patch rather than something more serious. Even so, the soft patch has implications for the Bank, because the monthly decision by the MPC on interest rates is data driven. Members of the committee have started to talk like hawks but slower growth, zero inflation, rising unemployment and consumer caution means they are likely to continue voting like doves.",

      "bodyText": "Joe Hockey has declared that the bottom line of his widely criticised first budget turned out to be $3bn better than expected in a piece of good news for the treasurer as he braces for the likely loss of the key economic portfolio in Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s looming cabinet reshuffle. The new prime minister is due to announce ministerial changes in coming days before an expected swearing-in ceremony on Monday. Scott Morrison is widely tipped to be named as the new treasurer after Turnbull\u2019s criticism of the Tony Abbott-led government\u2019s economic leadership. The Labor MP Ed Husic taunted Hockey about his future during question time on Thursday, asking what he had planned for his third budget, due in May next year. Hockey replied that \u201cwhatever\u2019s planned for the third budget is a hell of a lot better than Labor\u2019s last budget\u201d and that the former government \u201cwas a fiscal disaster and an economic disaster for Australia\u201d. He then pre-empted a statement he was due to make at the end of question time about the final budget outcome for the 2014-15 financial year. The full details are to be released on Monday. \u201cI have been informed by the Treasury of the final budget outcome for our first budget and that is that the budget bottom line is $3bn better than what we expected at budget time,\u201d Hockey said. \u201cThe government is spending nearly $3bn less than forecast and net government debt is reduced by $11.5bn more than we expected.\u201d Hockey\u2019s wife, Melissa Babbage, was seen in the public gallery for question time. In May 2015 Hockey estimated an underlying cash deficit of $41.1bn for the 2014-15 financial year. On Thursday his office said the final outcome was $38bn. Labor pointed out that the new deficit figure was still $14bn worse than the $24bn estimated for 2014-15 in the pre-election fiscal and economic outlook, which was was signed off by the secretaries of the Treasury and the Department of Finance before the 2013 election. Despite revealing the headline figures, Hockey said in a statement that the final budget outcome document was some days off being published. \u201cThe final budget outcome will be released in full on Monday morning,\u201d he said, arguing the figures showed the government was heading in the right direction. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the selective release of the figures was \u201ca final humiliating blow for the treasurer\u201d. \u201cThe final budget outcome won\u2019t be released until Monday with the swearing-in of the new treasurer,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThe time-honoured tradition is for [it] to be released publicly and the treasurer and finance minister to hold a press conference to explain and answer questions on the outcomes.\u201d Hockey is widely expected to lose his Treasury portfolio in the looming reshuffle. He made a public pitch for his colleagues to maintain their support for Abbott before the Liberal party room met for the leadership showdown on Monday. On Wednesday Hockey declined to speculate on his future but said he had been in discussions with the new prime minister and was continuing to do his job to his best ability. He would not say whether he had been offered another portfolio but said he was \u201cinstinctively a loyal person\u201d. Morrison declined to comment on whether he had been offered the position of treasurer, saying Turnbull would \u201cmake his comments about these things in his time\u201d. \u201cI will do whatever I can to serve the government by serving the Australian people, by doing the best job I can do in whatever task I\u2019m given, wherever that may be,\u201d he said on Thursday. Morrison, who has faced criticism from rightwing supporters of the party for not calling on his supporters to lock in behind Abbott\u2019s leadership, reaffirmed he had voted for Abbott in the ballot. \u201cEvents took a different course and the same focus that I\u2019ve applied in past roles I will apply to whatever future role the prime minister would now have me to serve in.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations special rapporteur for freedom of expression has criticised Vodafone\u2019s handling of a serious privacy breach of an Australian reporter\u2019s phone records, and said the unauthorised access showed \u201cno respect\u201d for source protection. David Kaye, whose role as special rapporteur involves monitoring serious issues around freedom of speech across the world, told the Guardian the incident reflected ongoing concerns in Australia about privacy and protecting journalists\u2019 sources. An Australian journalist with Fairfax Media, Natalie O\u2019Brien, had her call and text records accessed by a Vodafone employee in 2011, shortly after she reported on a major data breach within the Australian arm of the global company. She was not made aware that her phone records were accessed until this year. The company has now admitted the breach occurred, and on Tuesday it referred the matter to the Australian federal police for investigation. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, which regulates parts of the Australian telecommunications sector, has also been made aware of the breach. The incident may also have ramifications for Vodafone Group\u2019s British and international presence after emails published in the Australian newspaper revealed that a global manager, who was based in London, was made aware of the breach in 2012. Kaye said, \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental rule in advanced democracies for sure that the sources for journalists enjoy confidentiality. Here was a very clear example of a company breaching that confidentiality and circumventing any kind of legal procedure that might be out there. \u201cThe reporter is also a customer of Vodafone, and without her knowledge the company checked into her phone records. Putting aside domestic law, that\u2019s a real violation of her privacy and what she would expect with respect to her own phone company.\u201d Australia has been engaged in a lengthy debate about surveillance over the past two years after disclosures by Edward Snowden and a push from the federal government to pass mandatory data retention legislation to retain certain types of phone and web records for two years. The government succeeded in passing the new laws in March this year, despite concerns from privacy advocates. The revelations surrounding Vodafone have thrust the spotlight on to the corporate players involved in implementing this scheme, and the way private companies handle personal data. Kaye said, \u201cIt seems pretty egregious, whether we\u2019re talking about just a citizen or a journalist. It seems to me that as a matter of good corporate practice, particularly if this was a rogue operation, the company should have told her immediately. And they should have told her employer. \u201cThis was a breach that wasn\u2019t just personal, but it was really a breach that went to her practice as a journalist. She should have been told about the breach early on. \u201cThe underlying problem here is that there was no respect, at least from whoever breached the security here, for the concept of source protection.\u201d The Guardian has asked Vodafone Group in Britain whether any other executives were made aware of the incident in 2012, and what action they recommended Vodafone Australia take, but they have yet to respond. Vodafone Australia has released a lengthy statement about the breach, and said at the outset it strongly denied any allegations of improper behaviour. A further statement said the Vodafone Australia chief executive had apologised to O\u2019Brien. Its statement said: \u201cIn around June 2012, VHA became aware that an employee had, in January 2011, accessed some recent text messages and call records of a customer. VHA immediately commissioned an investigation by one of Australia\u2019s top accounting firms. \u201cThe investigation found there was no evidence VHA management had instructed the employee to access the messages and that VHA staff were fully aware of their legal obligations in relation to customer information.\u201d VHA told the Guardian it was taking the matter very seriously and would ensure there was full cooperation with investigations by the relevant authorities. \u201cVHA has reported this matter to the Australian federal police so that they can determine if there was any unlawful conduct surrounding the events in 2011. \u201cVHA is also cooperating fully with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Australian Communications and Media Authority.\u201d \u201cThe privacy of our customers and protection of their information is our highest priority and we take this responsibility very seriously.\u201d Australian Greens senator Scott Ludlam has urged the AFP to investigate the breach, and the Australian Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance has described the incident as unforgivable.",
