      "bodyText": "Increased uncertainty about global economic and financial developments was among the key concerns weighed by the Federal Reserve in January, according to the minutes of the central bank\u2019s last meeting released on Wednesday. Fed officials discussed plunging oil prices and slowing growth in China among other potential threats during the 26-27 January meeting, according to the minutes. Officials were particularly worried about what the slowdown in China would mean for the global financial markets. \u201cWhile the exposure of the United States to the Chinese economy through direct trade ties was limited, a number of participants were concerned about the potential drag on the US economy from the broader effects of a greater-than-expected slowdown in China and other emerging market economies,\u201d the minutes said. Minutes of their discussions show Fed officials acknowledging that the developments made it difficult to forecast growth and inflation prospects. As a result, they decided that the prudent approach was to defer a further hike in interest rates. The Fed kept its key interest rate in a range of 0.25% to 0.5% in January after hiking it by a quarter-point in December. The December hike was the first time in almost a decade that the Fed has raised interest rates. The last interest rate hike before that was in June 2006. While Fed officials continued to express confidence in the strengthening labor market, they were less bullish on other parts of the economy such as manufacturing. Figures released in January showed the US economy barely grew in the final three months of 2015, rising at an anaemic 0.7% annual rate. According to the minutes, the data on \u201cspending and production had been disappointing\u201d. The Fed officials also noted, however, that lower energy costs could have a potential positive effects on US economic activity. Two week after the January meeting, when Yellen testified in Congress, she said that low oil prices paired with steady job creation and faster wage growth could lead to an increase in consumer spending. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, the committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labour market indicators will continue to strengthen,\u201d she said. The minutes also revealed that despite increased uncertainty, the Federal Reserve is still considering gradual increases \u2013 if at a slower pace. \u201cWhile participants continued to expect that gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate, they emphasized that the timing and pace of adjustments will depend on future economic and financial-market developments and their implications for the medium-term economic outlook,\u201d the minutes said.",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce is seriously considering offering a seat on its board to ValueAct, the activist investor that has built a 10% stake in the engineering group. It is already clear that the two parties have come a long way since Rolls chief executive Warren East wrote an email to staff in August to describe ValueAct as an \u201copportunist\u201d trying to \u201cwhip up other shareholders to force a change\u201d. ValueAct representatives have visited Rolls\u2019s factory in Derby, met East, and spoken to the rest of the board and senior managers. Tellingly, ValueAct has also been relatively well behaved for an activist investor, saving any criticism of the company for private meetings. Rolls insists a final decision is yet to be made and will make an announcement in mid-March, when it publishes its annual report. If Rolls wants to give ValueAct the chance to win a seat on the board, shareholders would vote on the matter at the annual meeting in May. It is unnerving that an activist investor could have a say in the future of a company that was founded 110 years ago, even if ValueAct has so far behaved responsibly and insists it is in for the long haul. Rolls makes parts for Britain\u2019s nuclear submarines and is exactly the sort of high-tech manufacturer that the country should be anchoring its economy around. Yet, ValueAct\u2019s demands should force Rolls, and other listed companies, to take note. If a company is listed on the stock market then it is owned by its shareholders. If these shareholders do not feel that their views are being represented by the board, then they have the right to press for change. Too many boards in Britain do not challenge the chief executive. When the dust settles on most corporate crises \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland, Tesco, Volkswagen \u2013 it usually emerges that the chief executive was overbearing. The non-executive directors in FTSE boardrooms are too often picked from a small pool of establishment figures who rotate between companies. Rolls is by no means the worst culprit \u2013 it has five women on its board and international experience \u2013 but not enough views are being heard in Britain\u2019s boardrooms. Women, workers, and maybe even Californian hedge funds need stronger representation. Bombardier jet ambitions leave it facing turbulences The 7,000 job cuts at Bombardier are a hammer blow to the communities where its factories are based. More than 1,000 of the redundancies will be in Northern Ireland, where Bombardier is one of the biggest employers. But alongside the story of the devastating impact these cuts will have is a story about the perils of trying to take on Airbus and Boeing\u2019s dominance of the civil aerospace market. Bombardier is in trouble because it has burnt through billions of dollars trying to develope the C Series, a new passenger jet. The plane is over-budget, late and until Wednesday had not received an order since 2014. Bombardier has already received a $1bn (\u00a3700m) bailout from the government in Quebec, Canada, where it is based, and raised another $1.5bn from selling a stake in its train business. When the C Series was launched, Bombardier promoted the fuel efficiency of the aircraft and analysts said it could be the moment a challenger to Airbus and Boeing finally emerged. But in 2015 Airbus received 1,080 orders and Boeing 768. This was noticeably down on 2014 \u2013 showing the tough market Bombardier is trying to enter \u2013 but way ahead of the zero recorded by the Canadian company. The C Series may be a fine aircraft, but Airbus and Boeing have been able to fend it off simply by offering discounts on new planes to airlines and encouraging them to trust their track record of delivering high-quality models. China may eventually produce a challenger to the duopoly, but Bombardier is a cautionary tale for anyone who doubts Airbus and Boeing. Amazon\u2019s passion for fashion Amazon is advertising for 7,342 new staff on its website, showing its appetite for expansion remains undimmed. The online retailer has given its rivals another reason to be fearful after it emerged that Frances Russell, the former womenswear boss at Marks &amp; Spencer, is in talks to join the company\u2019s fledgling fashion business, which is preparing to launch an own-label clothing brand. This would open a new front in Amazon\u2019s drive to dominate the retail world. Fashion and food are the big holes in its offer \u2013 although it is growing fast in both \u2013 and the company still relies on selling other people\u2019s products, rather than making its own. Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s founder, clearly wants to fill these holes. But, as Russell knows from her time at M&amp;S, a track record of success and deep pockets count for little in the brutal clothing market.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asda is asking suppliers for discounts and cash contributions worth millions of pounds so it can fight back against the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl by slashing prices for shoppers. The supermarket, which is expected to reveal a sixth consecutive quarter of declining sales on Thursday after a tough Christmas, is calling in suppliers for individual discussions about ways to cut prices by as much as 10%, according to trade journal the Grocer. Template agreements handed to suppliers also ask for other payments \u2013 \u201cincremental investment\u201d \u2013 to cover the costs of promotions and other initiatives, such as new product development. One industry source told the Guardian that suppliers had been asked for \u201csignificant amounts of money\u201d. He added: \u201cIndividual suppliers are being asked for millions of pounds and asked what they want in return.\u201d Asda has become the UK\u2019s worst-performing supermarket in the face of heavy competition on price from the fast-growing discounter chains Aldi and Lidl. They have undercut the Walmart-owned chain, which made its name as the cheapest of the traditional supermarkets. Competition from rivals Morrisons and Tesco has also stepped up as they have trimmed prices and improved service under new management teams. Asda said it was \u201cworking collaboratively with suppliers\u201d to ensure it had the right ranges, quality and prices for its shoppers. The supermarket has pledged to ensure its prices are only 5% higher than the likes of Aldi and Lidl within the next few years, compared with 10% at present. Asda has said it will invest more than \u00a31bn in lowering prices. Prices could be lowered by changing to cheaper packaging, recipes or ingredients sourcing rather than by hitting suppliers\u2019 profits, Asda said. The range of products offered in some categories could also be slashed by as much as 25% as the grocer aims to push up volumes on the narrower range of items so that it can get better deals from suppliers in return for improved efficiency. On average, Asda has said it will trim ranges by a tenth. Andrew Moore, Asda\u2019s chief merchandising officer, said: \u201cValue is an important part of it. You can see what\u2019s happening with the discounters and other competitors. We have got to make sure our customers are getting the best value we can give them. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Asda coming in with a big bat and trying to make suppliers hit a particular price point. We are talking to big suppliers about what we know customers want in terms of range, assortment and quality and working with them to provide that.\u201d The retailer called in the consultancy firm Bain &amp; Company in the autumn to help it adapt its ranges to fit the latest consumer trends. Moore said Asda was working closely with Christine Tacon, the groceries code adjudicator, to ensure its negotiations met regulatory requirements. Tacon has launched an industry-wide consultation examining payments made by suppliers in order to participate when supermarkets review products stocked in a particular category. The inquiry was launched after Tacon found that Tesco had asked for such payments as well as investment \u2013 sometimes amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds \u2013 from suppliers to help underpin profits in a particular category. Tacon said: \u201cThere were a range of practices that I am concerned could amount to an indirect requirement for payment [related to positioning of products on shelves], contravening the code.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s most influential fund managers has said a British withdrawal from the EU would have no long-term negative impact on the UK economy and could even benefit it in the short term. Neil Woodford, whose \u00a38bn fund has large stakes in leading British companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, BT and BAE Systems, said much of the debate over British exit was \u201cbogus\u201d. Criticising both sides of the economic debate over Brexit, he said that claims that remaining in the EU was beneficial, or that pulling out was damaging, were both wrong. \u201cIt is really hard to see any credibility in an argument to stay or to leave constructed around economics. It\u2019s a nil-sum game. If we stay or we leave, the fundamentals of the economy will be relatively unmoved.\u201d The fund manager, who in 2014 quit asset management group Invesco Perpetual to set up his own operation \u2013 and attracted billions from small investors \u2013 commissioned research on the potential impact of a British withdrawal from the EU which he has posted on his website. The report, by consultancy Capital Economics, concluded: \u201cIt is plausible that Brexit could have a modest negative impact on growth and job creation. But it is slightly more plausible that the net impacts will be modestly positive.\u201d Woodford added that a British departure from the EU, and the economic uncertainty leading up to a referendum, was likely to push down the value of sterling, but that would help struggling exporters. \u201cIt will be a significant event globally that may well be reflected in weakness of sterling, but that will be relatively temporary. If the currency is weaker for a period, that will be potentially stimulative for the economy, so it might actually work out to be good news for exporters.\u201d Woodford\u2019s views puts him at odds with much of big business in the UK. Last week, HSBC warned that it could be forced to switch 1,000 banking jobs to France in the wake of a Brexit vote, while RBS chief Ross McEwan warned that the uncertainty caused by the upcoming referendum could \u201cslow down banking\u201d. Leaders of most big banks argue that leaving would endanger both the status of the City of London as Europe\u2019s financial centre, and growth prospects across the wider economy. The CBI has come out strongly in favour of Britain remaining in the EU, publishing a glossy leaflet underlining the benefits of EU membership. EasyJet also warned recently that fares would rise if Britain left. But Woodford is not alone among business and finance leaders, such as billionaire hedge fund operator Crispin Odey, and construction equipment company JCB boss Graeme Macdonald, in rejecting arguments that a UK withdrawal would seriously harm the economy. In the report from Capital Economics published on the Woodford Funds website, the researchers argue that; on immigration \u201cPolicy is far more likely to change to restrict the number of low-skilled workers entering the country and shift towards attracting more highly skilled workers. This would be a potential headache for low-wage sectors heavily dependent on migrant labour, such as agriculture, but could benefit other sectors with a shortage of highly skilled labour. on trade \u201cIt is highly probable that a favourable trade agreement would be reached after Brexit \u2026 it is certainly possible that leaving the EU would leave the external sector better off in the long run, if Britain could use its newfound freedom to negotiate its own trading arrangements to good effect. on financial services \u201cFinancial services have more to lose immediately after a EU exit than most other sectors of the economy. Even in the best case, in which passporting rights were preserved, the United Kingdom would still lose influence over the single market\u2019s rules.\u201d on foreign investment \u201cConcerns about a drying up of foreign direct investment if Britain votes to leave the European Union are somewhat overblown ... [but] we could see a period of weak foreign direct investment inflows as the United Kingdom\u2019s new relationship is renegotiated.\u201d on public finances \u201cThe British government could save about \u00a310bn per year on its contributions to the EU\u2019s budget if the country left the bloc. On the other hand, a little economic disruption and lower migration as a result of Brexit could offset these savings.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Iran has given a significant boost to oil prices by unexpectedly praising a plan put forward by Saudi Arabia and Russia to freeze production. The cost of Brent crude soared by 6.7% to $34.35 as Iran gave its verbal support for a production ceiling, even though it avoided making any immediate commitment to rein in its own growing output. \u201cIran backs any measures which help stabilise the market and improve the price of crude oil,\u201d said Bijan Zanganeh, the Iranian oil minister, after meeting his counterparts from Iraq, Qatar and Venezuela. But he did not mention any specific change in his own country\u2019s production strategy and other officials insisted that fellow-Opec members were aware Iran needed to increase its output to help rebuild the economy after years of sanctions. Saudi Arabia, the lead producer and power broker inside the Opec cartel, had agreed with non-Opec Russia to freeze production at January levels to counter an oil glut \u2013 but only if other major oil nations did the same. The two countries were particularly keen to bring in Iran and Iraq, which are both Opec members, because they are both currently working hard to increase their output held back in the past by trade bars and war respectively. The upbeat message from Iran following the meeting in Tehran contrasted with a more aggressive stance earlier. \u201cAsking Iran to freeze its production is illogical ... when Iran was under sanctions. some countries raised their output and they caused the drop in oil prices,\u201d said Opec\u2019s envoy, Mehdi Asali, ahead of the talks. \u201cHow can they expect Iran to cooperate now and pay the price?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have repeatedly said that Iran will increase its crude output until reaching the pre-sanctions production level.\u201d The chance of Iran agreeing to a Saudi deal was never high, not least given a history of enmity between the two regional rivals \u2013 most recently over Syria \u2013 as much as oil politics. The recent execution by the Saudis of a Shia cleric inflamed already difficult relations between the two countries. Iran is traditionally a Shia-dominated country compared to Saudi where rival Sunni muslims are in the majority. Even if Iran had agreed to follow the Saudi proposal and freeze production, there is considerable scepticism about whether this would be enough to change direction of the crude prices, which have slumped since hitting $118 in June 2014. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said: \u201cSuch a freeze will have little impact on the oil market as proposed, while there remains high uncertainty that it even materialises, in our view. \u201cAs a result, our oil supply and demand estimates remain unchanged and we reiterate our view that oil prices will remain volatile.\u201d In previous downturns, Saudi Arabia has been successful in encouraging others to cut their output. In 2001, Mexico, Norway and Russia all promised to act in concert to help raise oil prices. Opec has traditionally taken this role itself but for the last year and a half has steadfastly refused to alter the cartel\u2019s production targets as it seemed determined instead to drive rival US shale drillers out of business. Reza Zandi, a Tehran-based oil analyst, told Reuters that it would be impossible for Zanganeh to agree output restraint as there was broad consensus among Iranian officials to increase output to pre-sanctions levels. \u201cFreezing the output is against Iran\u2019s national and economic interests. Zanaganeh cannot accept it. The establishment has decided so.\u201d Despite those words, oil traders felt the positive words of support for the Saudi plan gave forward momentum to it and oil companies such as BP saw their shares rise in value by up to 4%. Still the outlook remains uncertain and the price of Brent has been extremely volatile for weeks. Countries such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela are desperately keen now to find a solution as their national budgets are being badly hit. Last month Saudi Arabia revealed that it was even thinking about selling off part of its state oil company Aramco which was previously considered the country\u2019s economic crown jewel. British consumers have been benefiting from lower petrol and power prices but there has been 70,000 direct and indirect jobs lost as a result of the downturn in the North Sea, which is a high-cost production area.",

      "bodyText": "Employment is at levels not seen since modern records began in the early 1970s. Hundreds of thousands of jobs are being created every year and most of them are full time. The jobless rate is half the European average. According to the Bank of England, wage settlements should be getting more generous as employers compete for a shrinking pool of workers. In fact, the opposite is happening. Despite a higher percentage of the population working than ever before, the annual rate of growth in earnings is falling not rising. Clearly, workers are not in such short supply as the Bank of England imagines. So what\u2019s going on? There is an argument that the weakness of wage growth is the story of the collapse of collective bargaining and the waning power of trade unions. This is not entirely convincing, since the influence of organised labour has been in decline since the 1980s, but it since the Great Recession of 2008-09 that the trend in average growth has markedly slowed. The last time unemployment was at its current rate of just over 5%, average earnings were growing at 4% a year: today they are growing at half that level. This cannot simply be about reforms made by Margaret Thatcher three decades ago. There are, though, three other possible explanations, which may be acting singly or collectively to keep earnings low. The first is that the supply of labour is increasing both as a result of population growth and immigration. The availability of work means Britain is acting as a jobs magnet for citizens of other EU countries. Between the final quarter of 2015 and the final quarter of 2016, the number of people working in Britain rose by 532,000. Almost half that increase \u2013 254,000 \u2013 was accounted for by non-UK nationals. There was a 215,000 increase in employment for workers from other EU countries. Employers don\u2019t need to raise pay if they can employ young willing workers from eastern Europe at the going rate. The second explanation is that the jobs being created by the economy tend to be ones that don\u2019t pay all that well: shop workers, hotel staff, cleaners. This, according to the Bank, is affecting the growth rate of earnings. A third factor is the squeeze on public sector pay, which has occurred despite higher levels of unionisation than in the rest of the economy. The public sector accounts for 18% of total employment, but earnings in the final three months of 2015 were growing at an annual rate of 1.3%. When compiling its average earnings figures, the Office for National Statistics does not include the self-employed. Were it to do so, pay growth would probably look even weaker since more than half the increase in employment over the latest three months was among people working for themselves. These people may have been highly paid consultants, but they are more likely to have been lowly paid drivers of delivery vans or taxis found through an online platform. Governments of both left and right have repeatedly claimed to be creating an economy awash with challenging, highly remunerated jobs. Instead, Britain specialises in low-wage, low-skill, low-productivity jobs. That\u2019s why earnings growth is so poor.",

      "bodyText": "A first UK interest rate rise since the financial crash appears to be even further away after official figures showed that wages growth last year dipped to 1.9%. Wages growth, which is watched carefully by the Bank of England for signs of inflation, lost momentum in December from a high of 3.3% last summer as the global slowdown in trade and turmoil on world stock markets hit the previously buoyant UK economy. The unemployment rate also disappointed the City after it failed to fall from 5.1% to 5% as expected following a 60,000 drop to 1.69 million unemployed people between October and December compared with the previous three months. Until the start of the new year policymakers at the central bank were expected to raise rates by the summer or autumn at the latest, but a delay is now likely, until at least the spring of 2017. Striking a more optimistic note, the Office for National Statistics figures published on Wednesday showed there was an increase in the number of people in work to a record high of 31.42 million and that wage growth excluding bonuses rose slightly to 2% from 1.9%. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the slowdown could be seen in the increase in employment by 205,000 in the three months to December, much less than the 267,000 gain in the three months to November. He said: \u201cWhile the jobs data look solid, there are some signs that employment growth could be starting to lose momentum. Some easing back in underlying employment growth was likely the consequence of the UK recently finding growth more difficult and companies finding it hard to get the qualified/skilled workers they need.\u201d Another factor limiting employment growth would come from those companies looking to lift the productivity of their workers in the face of the forthcoming introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d from April, he said. John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist consultancy, said the rise in employment was split roughly equally between employees and self-employed people, with 88,000 of the rise based on previously economically inactive people entering the labour market. \u201cDespite the good news on jobs this suggests deterioration in an already dire underlying productivity performance and in part helps explain why average weekly earnings excluding bonuses are still rising at an annual rate of only 2%. \u201cFor the time being, low consumer price inflation is protecting workers from the consequences of weakness in UK productivity and pay, but we face a rude awakening on jobs and living standards if and when prices start to rise again and/or if economic growth slows sharply.\u201d Inflation stood at 0.2% in December, before increasing to 0.3% in January, providing a 1.8% percentage point cushion with annual wage rises. Dennis de Jong, managing director at currency dealer UFX.com, said this gap made him more upbeat about the prospects for employment. \u201cThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest level in almost a decade and wage growth, excluding bonuses, has ticked up. \u201cChancellor George Osborne will be hoping that the introduction of the national living wage in April will see pay increase and help inflation rise further.\u201d Osborne said: \u201cIn the face of significant turbulence in the global economy, it is encouraging that more people than ever have the security of a job and a rising pay packet. \u201cWith a record number of people in work and unemployment and youth unemployment reaching 10-year lows, this is further evidence of the need to stick to the government\u2019s long-term plan to deliver economic security against the cocktail of risks affecting the world.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Concerns about the financial health of the commodities company Glencore have receded after its banks queued up to take part in a multi-billion-dollar debt refinancing. Glencore said its 37 main lenders offered up to $8.4bn (\u00a35.9bn) of loans, some $3bn more than they had previously made available to the company. The offering was scaled back to $7.7bn and the refinancing process will be opened up to a further 30 banks in the second quarter of the year, potentially taking the total above $8bn. Shares in the Switzerland-based miner jumped more than 16% to \u00a31.20 by close of trading on Wednesday, as investors applauded Glencore\u2019s public demonstration of its ability to secure new lending. It had been the subject of anxious speculation over the scale of its debts in the light of tumbling prices for the commodities it sells. Despite announcing plans to slash its net debt by $10bn last year, its share price has fallen 62% in the past 12 months as fears about its financial health have persisted. Glencore is understood to have refinanced deliberately early on the annual debt restructuring to allay any lingering concerns. It also felt the need to move fast in case strain in the global banking system makes credit more expensive over the next few months. The company is understood to be paying more for this loan than the previous credit line, but analysts at RBC Capital Markets estimate the extra cost at a relatively small $10m. Glencore said the new lending facility was unsecured, has no covenants attached to it and includes an option to extend by 12 months. It added that it now has no need of debt refinancing until May 2018 at the earliest. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the cost of the loan, understood to be about 100 basis points above the US dollar Libor rate, was \u201ca very positive surprise\u201d. The bank\u2019s analysts said the new facility would give Glencore \u201cbreathing room\u201d to continue its debt reduction plan, likely to involve the sale of its agricultural division for up to $4bn. Despite the jump in its share price, the stock remains well below its 2011 float price of \u00a35.30 owing to the global commodity price slump.",

      "bodyText": "The Canadian plane and train manufacturer Bombardier is to cut 7,000 jobs \u2013 one-tenth of its global workforce \u2013 over the next two years, including 1,350 in the UK. Bombardier\u2019s Belfast business, one of Northern Ireland\u2019s biggest employers, will be hit particularly hard. Bombardier is reducing the workforce by a fifth; 580 job losses are planned for this year and another 500 next year. Unions called the cuts a \u201chammer blow\u201d to the province\u2019s manufacturing base. Another 270 jobs will go at Bombardier\u2019s train-making factories across the UK, including Derby, its main site, which has just come to the end of a large contract for London Underground. Most of those affected are contractors, with fewer than 50 permanent workers losing their jobs. Montreal-based Bombardier, which received cash injections from the Quebec state government and pension fund last year, has been struggling to sell its long-delayed C Series passenger jets, owing to tough competition from Boeing and Airbus. The wings and many of the fuselages are made in Northern Ireland, where Bombardier employs 5,300 people. Of the 580 Belfast posts being cut this year, 380 come from the group\u2019s complementary labour force, which is made up of temporary and agency workers and fluctuates depending on projects. Bombardier\u2019s unionised workforce in Northern Ireland was asked to accept pay cuts last year but rejected them. The Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, said the news about Bombardier was \u201cbitterly disappointing\u201d given its role as a large employer in Northern Ireland. Villiers said she would be in touch with the UK\u2019s business ministry and Northern Ireland\u2019s enterprise minister, Jonathan Bell, to see what support might be available. Wednesday\u2019s announcement marks Bombardier\u2019s second wave of cuts after the firm axed 1,750 posts in Canada and Northern Ireland last year. The bulk of the latest round of cuts will be in Germany and Canada, but they will be partly offset by hiring in some areas. Cost overruns on the new C-series aircraft, which seats between 100 and 150 passengers, have been a drain on Bombardier\u2019s finances. Demand for business jets has also fallen. The firm has been hit by the economic slowdown in key markets such as China and Latin America, as well as western sanctions against Russia. Bombardier said it was finalising an order from Air Canada for up to 75 of the C-series 300 jets. It now has 678 orders and commitments for the series, which is due to start flying later this year with Lufthansa\u2019s Swiss subsidiary. The firm plans to hire more people to support production, including in Mirabel, Quebec. Its chief executive, Alain Bellemare, said: \u201cWe are turning Bombardier around to make this great company stronger and more competitive.\u201d But the Unite union said the latest cuts, which come on top of about 680 job losses at Bombardier Belfast last year, were \u201canother hammer blow\u201d to Northern Ireland\u2019s manufacturing base, and called on the Northern Ireland executive to set up a manufacturing taskforce. Davy Thompson, the union\u2019s regional coordinating officer, said: \u201cThe Northern Ireland executive needs to redouble their efforts and secure alternative employment for those highly skilled workers who will be made redundant. Invest NI must now commit themselves fully to proactively seeking foreign investment in manufacturing.\u201d Michael Mulholland, regional officer of the GMB union, called on the executive to hold a high-level meeting to see what can be done to help manufacturing. He said: \u201cThese job losses will have a massive impact on the Northern Ireland economy as they will see the loss of well-paid jobs from the local economy. The devastating impact of these job losses in Northern Ireland comes on top of the loss of manufacturing jobs at Michelin and Gallaher\u2019s.\u201d Michelin closed its Ballymena truck tyre factory in November, with the loss of 860 jobs. Cigarette maker JTI Gallaher also shut its factory in Ballymena, County Antrim, with a similar number of job losses. Bombardier took $5.6bn of writedowns mainly related to the C Series last year, pushing its net annual loss to $5.3bn from $1.3bn. Turnover fell 9.5% to $18.2bn. Revenues are set to fall further this year, to $16.5bn-$17.5bn. The company said: \u201cWe deeply regret the impact [the job cuts] will have on our workforce and their families, but it is crucial that we right-size our business in line with market realities. We will continue to evaluate all opportunities to significantly reduce our costs, improve our competitiveness, and boost our profitability.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Number of EU workers in Britain remains above 2m", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s record of low unemployment continues to act as a magnet for European Union migrants, with the total number of workers from the other 27 EU nations remaining above 2 million. Employment figures covering the three months to December show that the number of non-UK EU nationals working in Britain rose to 2.04 million. This was a slight rise on the previous quarter, when this figure topped 2 million for the first time. Over the previous year, 278,000 UK workers found a job, taking the total number in work to 28.28 million, while the total number of non-UK nationals working in Britain increased by 254,000 to 3.22 million. The figures are likely to put pressure on David Cameron as he battles to restrict the access to some in-work benefits to UK nationals during his negotiations with EU leaders. The Tory party and some economists believe the lure of tax credits and child benefit, which act as a top-up for lower wage jobs, has encouraged a wave of migrant workers into minimum wage service industry jobs. However, research by the National Institute of Economic &amp; Social Research has shown that a cut in the number of migrants would have a negative impact on the economy. The figures from the Office for National Statistics published on Wednesday showed that wages growth lost momentum in December for an eighth straight month. Analysts said the fall in wages to 1.9% indicated that a first UK interest rate rise since the financial crash would be even further away than expected. The Bank of England has highlighted the decline in wages growth as one of the main reasons for keeping the base rate at 0.5%. Until the start of the new year policymakers at the Bank were expected to raise rates by the summer or autumn at the latest, but a delay is now likely until at least the spring of 2017. The unemployment rate also disappointed the City after it failed to fall from 5.1% to 5% as expected following a 60,000 fall to 1.69 million unemployed people between October and December compared with the previous three months. Striking a more optimistic note, the ONS figures showed there was an increase in the number of people in work to a record high of 31.42 million and wages excluding bonuses rose slightly to 2% from 1.9%. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the slowdown could be seen in the increase in employment by 205,000 in the three months to December, much less than the 267,000 gain in the three months to November. He said: \u201cWhile the jobs data look solid, there are some signs that employment growth could be starting to lose momentum. Some easing back in underlying employment growth was likely the consequence of the UK recently finding growth more difficult and companies finding it hard to get the qualified/skilled workers they need.\u201d Another factor limiting employment growth would come from those companies looking to lift the productivity of their workers in the face of the forthcoming introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d from April 2016, he said. John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said the rise in employment was split roughly equally between employees and self-employed people, 88,000 of the rise based on previously economically inactive people entering the labour market. \u201cDespite the good news on jobs this suggests deterioration in an already dire underlying productivity performance and in part helps explain why average weekly earnings excluding bonuses are still rising at an annual rate of only 2%. \u201cFor the time being low consumer price inflation is protecting workers from the consequences of weakness in UK productivity and pay but we face a rude awakening on jobs and living standards if and when prices start to rise again and/or if economic growth slows sharply.\u201d Inflation stood 0.2% in December, before increasing to 0.3% in January, providing a 1.8% cushion with annual wage rises. Dennis de Jong, managing director at currency dealer UFX.com, said this gap made him more upbeat about the prospects for employment. \u201cThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest level in almost a decade and wage growth, excluding bonuses, has ticked up. \u201cChancellor George Osborne will be hoping that the introduction of the national living wage in April will see pay increase and help inflation rise further.\u201d Osborne said: \u201cIn the face of significant turbulence in the global economy, it is encouraging that more people than ever have the security of a job and a rising pay packet. \u201cWith a record number of people in work and unemployment and youth unemployment reaching 10-year lows, this is further evidence of the need to stick to the government\u2019s long term plan to deliver economic security against the cocktail of risks affecting the world.\u201d \u25cf This article was amended on Thursday 18 February. It originally stated that the number of non-UK EU nationals working in Britain was above 2 million for the first time in the final three months of 2015, when the figure went above 2 million in the previous quarter.",

Some easing back in underlying employment growth was likely the consequence of the UK recently finding growth more difficult and companies finding it hard to get the qualified/skilled workers they need.\u201d</p> <p>Another factor limiting employment growth would come from those companies looking to lift the productivity of their workers in the face of the forthcoming introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d from April 2016, he said.</p> <p>John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said the rise in employment was split roughly equally between employees and self-employed people, 88,000 of the rise based on previously economically inactive people entering the labour market. </p> <p>\u201cDespite the good news on jobs this suggests deterioration in an already dire underlying productivity performance and in part helps explain why average weekly earnings excluding bonuses are still rising at an annual rate of only 2%. </p> <p>\u201cFor the time being low consumer price inflation is protecting workers from the consequences of weakness in UK productivity and pay but we face a rude awakening on jobs and living standards if and when prices start to rise again and/or if economic growth slows sharply.\u201d </p> <p>Inflation stood 0.2% in December, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/16/interest-rate-rise-judged-unlikely-as-inflation-increases-only-slightly\">before increasing to 0.3% in January</a>, providing a 1.8% cushion with annual wage rises.</p> <p>Dennis de Jong, managing director at currency dealer UFX.com, said this gap made him more upbeat about the prospects for employment. </p> <p>\u201cThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest level in almost a decade and wage growth, excluding bonuses, has ticked up.</p> <p>\u201cChancellor George Osborne will be hoping that the introduction of the national living wage in April will see pay increase and help inflation rise further.\u201d<br></p> <p>Osborne said: \u201cIn the face of significant turbulence in the global economy, it is encouraging that more people than ever have the security of a job and a rising pay packet.</p> <p>\u201cWith a record number of people in work and unemployment and youth unemployment reaching 10-year lows, this is further evidence of the need to stick to the government\u2019s long term plan to deliver economic security against the cocktail of risks affecting the world.\u201d <br></p> <p>\u25cf This article was amended on Thursday 18 February.

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce is said to be preparing to allow ValueAct a seat on its board after the US activist investor sought to reassure the company and its shareholders that it was a long-term backer with the right experience to help revive the embattled engineer. Allowing a US activist fund a board seat at a FTSE 100 company would be highly unusual, but ValueAct has been working behind the scenes to convince Rolls-Royce and its shareholders that it is not an opportunistic investor seeking a rapid break-up or trying to extract cash from the business. ValueAct bought a 5.5% stake in Rolls-Royce last July and said it wanted to work with the company to improve its performance. The San Francisco-based fund increased its stake to 10% in November as it stepped up pressure for board representation. Rolls-Royce wanted to make sure any person nominated by ValueAct could add skills and experience to the board and that it could win shareholder backing for the decision. Bradley Singer, ValueAct\u2019s chief operating officer, has met some of Rolls-Royce\u2019s large shareholders to reassure them about ValueAct\u2019s intentions. Singer is likely to be ValueAct\u2019s board representative and Rolls-Royce could announce his nomination soon before a vote at its annual general meeting in May, the Financial Times reported (\u00a3) on Wednesday. Rolls-Royce shares, down by a third since last April, rose 1.3% to 639p in early trading. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re engaged in constructive discussions with ValueAct and no decision has yet been taken by the board.\u201d A spokeswoman for ValueAct declined to comment. Rolls-Royce has issued a string of profit warnings before and after ValueAct bought its stake and last week cut its dividend for the first time in 24 years. Warren East, who took over as chief executive in July, has said the group is bloated and cumbersome, making it too slow to react to market changes. The company has also been affected by cuts to defence budgets, falling demand for corporate jets in emerging markets and plunging oil prices that have forced energy companies to reduce spending. East has said he is content with Rolls-Royce\u2019s range of businesses, which include making marine engines and reactors for nuclear submarines. In discussions with the company and shareholders, ValueAct has played down any immediate desire to split off those businesses from the core aerospace division, the FT reported. After early reluctance, the Derby-based group became more open to appointing a director from ValueAct, whose co-founder Jeffrey Ubben has helped engineer corporate shakeups such as the departure of former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer. ValueAct has pressed for changes at 75 companies since Ubben launched the firm in 2000. But the fund seeks to distinguish itself from aggressive US activists such as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman, who use public campaigns to pressurise boards into doing their bidding. ValueAct portrays itself as a low-key, long-term investor working more like a private equity firm to improve a company\u2019s performance over many years.",

Consumer groups such as Choice had asked for independent review to be undertaken. When asked by reporters during an address to the National Press Club, Morrison flatly refused. \u201cThe work has been done ... in securing these agreements and the sceptics will always doubt the trade benefits of these sorts of deals,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re welcome to their scepticism.

      "bodyText": "Millions of Britons are putting their health at risk by ordering hot chocolate and other trendy chai drinks that contain staggering amounts of sugar \u2013 up to 25 teaspoons \u2013 in just one serving. Action on Sugar found that 98% of the 131 hot flavoured drinks found in the big high street chains would carry a \u201cred\u201d warning for excessive levels of sugar if the coffee shops were forced to label them. The campaign group named Starbucks\u2019s Hot Mulled Fruit (grape with chai, orange and cinnamon venti) as the worst offender. At 25 teaspoons of sugar it contains more than three times the recommended maximum adult daily intake. Costa\u2019s largest chai latte was found to contain 20 teaspoons of sugar, while an extra large Signature hot chocolate from Starbucks contained 15 teaspoons, double the daily adult maximum. More than one-third of the drinks tested were found to contain the same \u2013 or higher \u2013 levels of sugar as a can of Coca-Cola. The high street chains have increasingly offered chai, chocolate and other hot drinks to attract non-coffee drinkers. They also offer high-sugar syrups to add extra flavour. It is thought up to 20% of the population visit a coffee shop on a daily basis, but many will be unaware how much hidden sugar they are consuming in flavoured drinks. Action on Sugar has called on the coffee chains to stop serving extra-large cups of sugar-laden hot drinks. It singled out Starbucks for criticism because, it said, its serving sizes were much larger than those offered by its competitors. Starbucks told the Guardian it was committed to reducing added sugar in its indulgent drinks by 25% by the end of 2020, and that \u201call nutritional information is available in-store and online\u201d. Costa said it had already taken significant steps to reduce the sugar content of its ranges, and that in April it would be setting salt and sugar reduction targets for 2020. Kawther Hashem, registered nutritionist and researcher for Action on Sugar, said these hot flavoured drinks had to become an occasional treat, rather than an everyday purchase. \u201cThey are laden with an unbelievable amount of sugar and calories and are often accompanied by a high sugar and fat snack. It is not surprising that we have the highest rate of obesity in Europe. \u201cOur advice to consumers is to have a plain hot drink or ask for your drink to contain a minimal amount of syrup, preferably sugar-free, in the smallest serving size available.\u201d Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, described the findings as further evidence of the \u201cscandalous amount of sugar added to our food and drink\u201d. He called on the prime minister, David Cameron, to urgently establish an independent agency for nutrition that is \u201cnot controlled\u201d by the food industry. In 2012 the food industry agreed a series of voluntary pledges with the Department of Health in which it committed to ensure that Britons consumed 5bn less calories a day. However, the \u201cresponsibility deal\u201d, as it is termed, has been criticised as failing to deliver any real impact. Action on Sugar has called for a 50% reduction in sugar and a 20% reduction in fat in all unhealthy drinks and foods within five years, and a ban on all forms of advertising of unhealthy foods and drinks to children and adolescents. In November a hard-hitting report from MPs said a 20% sugar levy was an essential part of any national strategy to tackle child obesity. See the full results at Action on Sugar\u2019s website.",

Announcing a 3.5% rise in first-quarter profits to $1.85bn on Wednesday, chief executive Shayne Elliott admitted that volatility in the region and the impact on the bank\u2019s bottom line had been greater than the $735m already pencilled in. ANZ, the most Asia-focused of Australia\u2019s big four banks, has seen its shares fall nearly 40% since April 2015 as uncertainty about the Chinese economy rippled through the regions economy and stock markets. Elliott, who is under pressure from shareholders to decouple the bank from the expansionary strategy of predecessor Mike Smith, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that the Asian region in particular has been slowing for a period. \u201cI think what we saw though, at the beginning of the calendar year, is that it\u2019s been a little bit more volatile than we were certainly expecting and some of those conditions have been a little more difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s around south-east Asia, it\u2019s broadly based; it\u2019s not one customer group in particular or anything like that. But it does tend to be concentrated around manufacturing, industrial companies exposed to trade.\u201d The $800m bad debt charge will blight first-half results due in May but Elliott, the former chief financial officer who replaced Smith in January, said ANZ was taking action to cut costs and \u201creposition\u201d the business. The bank said income growth outstripped that of expenses over the three months to 31 December, with technology investment and wage inflation largely offset by a 2.5% reduction in staff numbers. Net interest margin \u2013 the profit on loans \u2013 contracted two basis points from the second half of FY15 to 2.02% once the impact of the bank\u2019s institutional markets business was taken into account. But the bank said its Australia and New Zealand retail business gained market share in key home lending markets, while small business grew strongly in both countries. \u201cI think the underlying businesses that we have, as I said, will continue to do well: retail and commercial here, our trade and capital flow intermediation businesses,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThere\u2019s undoubtedly going to be some challenges as a result of the slowing global economy and in particular the slowing Asian economy.\u201d Net profit, which includes one-off expenses, was down about 3% on the prior corresponding period to $1.6bn.",
