      "bodyText": "Plain cigarette cartons featuring large, graphic health warnings could persuade 300,000 people in the UK to quit smoking if the measure has the effect it had in Australia, scientists say. Standardised cigarette packaging will be compulsory in the UK from 20 May. A new review from the independent health research organisation Cochrane on the impact of plain packaging around the world has found that it does affect the behaviour of smokers. In the UK, the tobacco industry has become increasingly innovative in the design of cigarette packets as other controls on sales and advertising have taken hold, according to Ann McNeill, professor of tobacco addiction at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThe tobacco industry has been focusing its efforts on the tobacco packs,\u201d she said. Among those that will be banned are vibrant pink packets, targeted at young women, and gimmicky cartons that slide rather than flip open. The rules that come into force next month require all packs to look alike, with graphic health warnings across 65% of their surface. The Cochrane reviewers found 51 studies that looked at standardised packaging and its impact on smokers, but only one country had implemented the rule fully at the time. Australia brought in plain packs in 2012. Analysing the evidence from Australia, the team found a reduction in smoking of 0.5% up to one year after the policy was introduced. According to the Australian government, that translates to 100,000 people no longer smoking. The decline was attributable specifically to plain packaging, after taking into account the continuing drop in the numbers of smokers caused by other tobacco control measures. Dr Jamie Hartmann-Boyce of the Cochrane tobacco addiction group at Oxford University\u2019s Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences said: \u201cWe are not able to say for sure what the impact would be in the UK, but if the same magnitude of decrease was seen in the UK as was observed in Australia, this would translate to roughly 300,000 fewer smokers following the implementation of standardised packaging.\u201d The review found signs that more people were trying to quit smoking as a result of plain cartons, rising from 20.2% before to 26.6% after introduction. There was also evidence that standardised packs were less attractive to those who did not smoke, making it less likely that they would start. However, the researchers say variations in the way countries are introducing standardised packs may affect the outcomes. Some allow different colours, slightly different carton shapes and the use of descriptive words such as \u201cgold\u201d or \u201csmooth\u201d. Cancer Research UK backs plain packaging. \u201cSmoking kills 100,000 people in the UK every year, so we support any effective measure which can help reduce this devastating impact. The evidence shows that standardised packaging works and helps to reduce smoking rates,\u201d said George Butterworth, the charity\u2019s tobacco policy manager. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to see the impact in the UK, as the new legislation will only be fully implemented in May, but we hope to see similar positive results as the UK strives towards a day when no child smokes tobacco. Cancer Research UK is continuing to evaluate the impact of standardised packaging in the UK and will share the lessons with other countries who are considering introducing them.\u201d Simon Clark, director of the smokers\u2019 group Forest, said the idea that plain packaging would have an impact on the number of smokers in the UK was based on \u201chope and anecdotal evidence\u201d. \u201cSince plain packaging was introduced in Australia, smoking rates have fallen, but only in line with historical trends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s grasping at straws to credit plain packaging with the continued reduction in smoking rates, because the most significant anti-smoking measure in recent years in Australia has been a massive increase in tobacco taxation. Like graphic health warnings, the novelty of plain packaging quickly wears off.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The eighth annual rental affordability snapshot released by Anglicare on Wednesday reveals that, for those on welfare payments and the minimum wage, rental affordability remains at crisis point. While much of the talk in the run-up to the budget has been about the affordability of buying a house, the snapshot is a strong reminder of the inadequacy of welfare payments such as Newstart and the desperation many low-income families face just trying to find a roof to live under. On Tuesday the latest consumer price figures showed that while inflation growth jumped a little bit to 2.1%, rental price growth at 0.6% remains the lowest it has been for more than 20 years. This slowing of rental price growth is the main driver behind the findings of the latest Anglicare rental affordability snapshot, which show that rental affordability for couples on the minimum wage has improved ever so slightly over the past year. Since the middle of 2014 rental prices across Australia have on average been rising slower than the minimum wage and, since the end of 2015, they have been rising slower than overall inflation: But while this does help low-income families, it has done little to undo the massive rent price increases of 2007 to 2012. Over the past decade, while the minimum wage has risen 31%, and inflation has gone up 27%, rents have soared 48%. It is much less affordable to rent now than it was a decade ago: But one problem with looking at rental prices across the nation is that rents \u2013 perhaps even more so than house prices \u2013 are greatly affected by local conditions. The best example is the difference between Sydney and Perth over the past 15 years. During the boom periods, Perth and Sydney both saw rents zoom upwards but the prices in Perth were much greater. But the end of the mining boom has seen rent prices in Perth collapse over the past two years. In the past 12 months, while the price of rents in Sydney rose by a still historically low rate of just 2.5%, in Perth rents on average have fallen 7.3%. So drastically have rents fallen in Perth that they are back at the level paid in December 2011, whereas in Sydney they are now 17% higher than then: The other issue for rental affordability is availability. The snapshot assumes that a family with two children would require a three-bedroom property and that \u201cshare accommodation\u201d is also not suitable for couples or families except for couples on an aged pension. The report also assumes that, for a property to be affordable, the rent should be less than 30% of household income. Across the nation, Anglicare found that of the 67,651 dwellings that were available for rent on the weekend of 1-2 April, only 6% were are suitable for households on government benefits. This was slightly down on the 7% in 2016. The story is better for households on the minimum wage (either singles or couples), with 30% suitable for any of those four types of households \u2013 but again slightly down from 31% in 2016. But these figures \u2013 as bad as they are \u2013 hide the crisis for many types of households. For example, across Australia, there were just 21 dwellings that were affordable for a single person on Newstart and just 1.5% of dwellings were suitable and affordable for a single parent subsisting on the parenting payment. Even for a single person on minimum wage, just 1.6% of dwellings were affordable: Across the capital cites, the picture of affordability improved most for couples on the minimum wage but has actually slightly worsened for single people on minimum wage. The deteriorating situation for single people on minimum wage is driven mostly by the big fall in affordability in Melbourne, where there the snapshot notes there is a \u201cdearth of appropriate and affordable rentals for most categories of low-income earners\u201d: But changes can also disguise the picture. One reason for small changes in affordability for households dependent upon welfare is because no dwellings are available at all. The situation has not become worse only because it was already at rock bottom. For example, out of 13,447 properties in the greater Sydney and Illawarra areas, not one was affordable for a person on Newstart, the parenting payment, youth allowance or disability support pension, and just 23 were affordable for a single person on the minimum wage: The situation is slightly varied across the nation. While just 12% of properties in Brisbane are affordable for a couple both on the minimum wage with two children under 10, 41% of properties in Adelaide are affordable. The falling rent prices have meant the situation in Perth is much improved on last year \u2013 48% of properties are affordable for such a couple compared with just 39% last year: The snapshot reveals that, for most people dependent on welfare, it also means being dependent upon others for housing \u2013 as it is impossible to live independently. Anglicare\u2019s recommendations to the crisis will both please and displease the treasurer, Scott Morrison, as he finalises the May budget. Anglicare recommends the government create a \u201cnational affordable housing finance corporation, modelled on the successful UK entity, to leverage government guarantees and bond aggregation for more investment in community and affordable housing\u201d. This is something that the treasurer has been floating over the past few months and last month he announced an affordable housing taskforce to develop the bond aggregator model. But Anglicare also recommends the government \u201cwind back negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions, and redirect funds saved into public and community housing\u201d. It also recommends the government increase \u201cincome payments to that of a living wage\u201d. The issue, however, is not only about money and tax incentives but also how renters are treated. The snapshot notes that \u201cin all states and territories except Tasmania, landlords are able to evict tenants on periodic leases without cause\u201d. Such actions can have damaging consequences, with the report noting that it can cause children to be \u201cplaced in foster care simply because the parents are unable to quickly secure affordable and appropriate accommodation when this happens\u201d. As a result, Anglicare recommends the government implement \u201ca national renter\u2019s rights plan that delivers consistent and fair renting conditions for all Australians\u201d. The annual rental affordability snapshot is a welcome reminder that housing affordability is not just about buying a home. It also welcome given that in the run-up to the budget talk will be of tax cuts for companies and that people earning $80,000 are considered middle Australia. The snapshot reveals that many on government benefits or even on minimum wage are essentially denied the ability to live independently \u2013 surely a sign that such incomes are woefully inadequate.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us; thanks for reading and commenting! GW Steven Mnuchin\u2019s claim that faster economic growth would help fund these tax cuts (see here) has been rubbished by one former White House staffer. CNBC explains: \u201cThis idea that growth can pay for these kinds of huge tax cuts is operating in fairyland,\u201d former Clinton administration budget director Leon Panetta told MSNBC on Wednesday. \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t work, so if you\u2019re going to do a tax cut, then show how you\u2019re paying for it.\u201d Here\u2019s our US business editor Dominic Rushe on today\u2019s tax announcement (with links to the key points in this liveblog) Trump\u2019s \u2018huge tax cut for the rich\u2019 would slash taxes for businesses and wealthy The Trump administration unveiled what it called the biggest tax cuts \u201cin history\u201d on Wednesday in a move that will simplify the US tax system, slash taxes for businesses large and small (including his own), eliminate inheritance taxes and set the president on a collision course with Congress over the likely $2tn-plus cost of the proposal. Critics immediately called it \u201cbasically a huge tax cut for the rich\u201d. The plan would cut the US\u2019s individual income tax brackets from seven to three (10%, 25% and 35%) and slash US corporate tax rates from 35% to 15%. \u201cWe have a once in a generation opportunity to do something really big,\u201d said Gary Cohn, chief economic adviser to Donald Trump. \u201cThis is about growing the economy, creating jobs.\u201d Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, were short on details of the plan that, if passed, would be the largest overhaul of the US tax system since the Reagan era. \u201cWe are moving as quickly as we can,\u201d said Mnuchin. The announcement comes amid a continuing row over Trump\u2019s own taxes, with members of his own party asking for him to release his returns before pressing ahead with tax reforms. Mnuchin said on Wednesday that Trump \u201chas no intention\u201d of releasing his tax returns to the public. As well as slashing costs for his own businesses, the new proposals will also cut the alternative minimum tax (AMT), a tax designed to stop the super-wealthy from taking so many tax deductions that they avoid paying anything. Leaked documents have shown that in 2005 Trump paid $31m in tax thanks to the AMT. Mnuchin and Cohn were pressed on how Trump would benefit from the proposals but avoided the questions. \u201cWhat this is about is creating job and economic growth,\u201d Mnuchin said. Mnuchin described the proposals as \u201cthe biggest tax cut and the largest tax reform in the history of our country\u201d.... Here\u2019s Dom\u2019s full story: The US stock market has greeted the plan with a shrug. The Dow Jones industrial average is up just 37 points, or 0.2%, with similar small gains on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. That\u2019s because some of the details had already leaked, so were \u2018priced in\u2019, and also because it\u2019s not clear that the plan can really be implemented. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: Stocks pared gains, sliding as the \u2018details\u2019 were announced, while the dollar also handed back gains. For all the hype, this just wasn\u2019t quite enough to send everything skyward.... We have to factor in considerable risk that the president won\u2019t get his way on tax and must be sceptical about whether the package will make it through the legislature in its current guise. Economics professor Justin Wolfers is also sceptical that this plan can get approved. That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t appear to pay for itself or appeal to Democrats on Capitol Hill. Analysts at Capital Economics are sceptical that the House and the Senate will approve this plan: The \u201cnew\u201d tax plan that the White House unveiled today looks a lot like President Donald Trump\u2019s old economic plan from the election campaign, with deep cuts to corporate and individual tax rates. Even with dynamic scoring, however, the old plan was expected to increase the Federal budget deficit by $7trn over the next decade. For that reason alone, this plan is never getting approved by Congress, particularly not through a budget reconciliation that requires ten-year revenue neutrality. Donald Trump\u2019s historic tax reform plan actually fits on a single sheet of paper, with just a dozen key bullet points: Here\u2019s a video clip of Steven Mnuchin being quizzed about Donald Trump\u2019s elusive tax returns: Q: Analysis of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns from 2005 show that without the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) he would have only paid \u00a35.3m of tax.. So doesn\u2019t that show that these tax reforms will benefit the president and his companies? This plan is about \u201ccreating jobs and creating economic growth\u201d, Mnuchin insists. We\u2019re talking about massive tax cuts, massive tax reforms, simplifying the system. The AMT is just a \u201cthird complicated set of rules\u201d, he insists [explainer: AMT is a supplementary income tax aimed at preventing the richest people avoiding tax] And that\u2019s the end of the session -- Spicer, Cohn and Mnuchin exit smartly, as a reporter shouts whether Trump might yet change his mind about releasing his tax returns. Q: Will these plans mean president Trump pays more or less tax? I can\u2019t comment on the president\u2019s tax situation since I don\u2019t have access to that, Mnuchin smiles. Our objective is the reduction in taxes is offset by significant reductionin deductions and other items. So the effective tax rate is what we\u2019re focused on, he adds. Q: What does this proposal mean for American families watching from home? It means a tax cut, national economics director Gary Cohn promises. Q: How much? We\u2019ll let you know as soon as the final details are agreed, Cohn promises. The elephant in the room rears its trunk... Q: Will the president release his tax returns? Trump has \u201cno intention\u201d of releasing his tax returns, Mnuchin replies. He\u2019s released \u201cplenty of information....I think the US population has plenty of information.\u201d Q: This is just one page - just a statement of principles. When do we see full details? We\u2019re working as fast as we can, Mnuchin replies. Q: When would the Death Tax be repealed? Our initial proposal is to phase it out immediately, as son as this new tax package is passed into law, Cohn replies. Q: Is there a danger that Republicans won\u2019t support this package, as with Trump\u2019s healthcare reforms? There is a lot of desire from everyone to reform the tax system, Mnuchin replies. We have agreement on the core principles of this package. Q: Will this package pay for itself? We\u2019re working on the details, says Mnuchin, before promising: This will pay for itself with extra growth, and by reducing tax deductions and closing loopholes. Gary Cohn also wades in, declaring that the plan will cut debt as a percentage of GDP. In other words, the economy would grow faster than the national debt. Q: You talked about repealing the 3.8% Obamacare rate that hits small businesses - is this the first attempt to start pulling Obamacare back? We are trying to get rid of that tax so we can get more capital back into the economy and stimulate business investment, says Cohn. Q: What do you say to critics who say this package is about helping corporations, not reforming the tax code? This package is about growing the economy and creating jobs, Cohn replies. Asked for more details about the plans, Cohn says the administration is still working with the House and the Senate to agree final details. The goal is to simplify the tax system, lower rates, and make the system fairer, he adds. Q: What are the income boundaries for the new 10%, 25% and 35% tax brackets? Cohn won\u2019t say - only that there is a \u2018broad brush\u2019 view of where they\u2019ll be. We\u2019ll be back to you with very firm details, he promises. Now Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks, confirming that the US corporation tax rate will fall to 15%. Small and medium-sized firms will benefit, he pledges, not just big business. Mnuchin also confirms a tax repatriation holiday for businesses who have got cash piles stacked overseas, but doesn\u2019t give details. Cohn predicts that the Trump administration will be attacked from both sides, but he wouldn\u2019t bet against the president getting this plan through. As rumoured, the plan cuts the number of tax brackets to three, from seven. We will repeal the Death Tax on American\u2019s estates, says Cohn -- something West Wing fans will be familiar with. Trump is creating a new zero-rate tax band, Cohn says, that means married couples won\u2019t pay tax on the first $24,000 they earn. Cohn outlines how complicated the US tax code has become - it now comes with 211 pages of instructions. Americans spend 7 billion hours complying with tax codes each year, he declares - and almost everyone needs some help filling the form in. Gary Cohn speaks first. This is a historic day, he says - a once in a generation opportunity. The president is going to lead the most significant tax reform legislation sine 1986, and one of the biggest tax cuts in history. Many of the key principles have already been agreed with Congress, Cohn continues, and the administration will work hard over the next few weeks to get a full agreement. Tax reform is \u2018long overdue\u2019, he continues - both for business and families, especially low and middle-income ones. The session is underway - press secretary Sean Spicer jokes that he didn\u2019t expect such a big audience for an announcement about the Antiquities Act (tee hee....) I think this live feed should let you watch Mnuchin and Cohn in action.... Some Republicans are already concerned that Trump\u2019s plan is all about tax cuts, and not really about reforms at all. CNN has the details: House Speaker Paul Ryan put a positive spin on things during his own news conference Wednesday, but things are far from great behind the scenes. The Trump administration has ruffled GOP feathers on Capitol Hill, by getting in the way of legislators efforts to fix the tax system. \u201cIt\u2019s not tax reform,\u201d said one senior GOP aide. \u201cNot even close.\u201d We\u2019re expecting to hear details of the tax reform plan very shortly.... While we wait to hear from Steven Mnuchin (and Gary Cohn) here\u2019s a video clip of him speaking earlier today: CNBC\u2019s Eamon Javers has heard that Trump\u2019s plan might eliminate some tax exemptions (which allow people to lower their overall bill) It was not a convincing display, but this week\u2019s market rally which began with Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory in the first round of the French election and was then fuelled by the prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, has continued for another day. Ahead of the confirmation of the US president\u2019s plans European markets ended higher, helped by a positive morning on Wall Street. There was still some caution in Europe, as investors awaited Thursday\u2019s meeting of the European Central Bank, which will be carefully scrutinised for any hints that the bank might begin withdrawing its economic stimulus measures. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 13.08 points or 0.18% at 7288.72 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.05% at 12,472.80 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.19% higher at 5287.88 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.15% to 20,836.51 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.18% at 10,763.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.3% to 706.40 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 56 points or 0.27% higher. Not everyone is upbeat about Trump\u2019s corporation tax reform. ActionAid head of policy Anna Thomas said: President Trump\u2019s plan to slash the corporate tax rate risks triggering a global race to the bottom, which could see companies paying minimal taxes around the world. Despite public outrage at corporate tax scandals involving the likes of Google and Amazon, big companies look set to benefit from historically low rates. The IMF has found that when countries try to undercut each other on tax, poorer countries suffer the most. They are particularly dependent on corporation tax and stand to lose the most as they come under pressure to offer ever-lower tax rates to big companies. Healthcare, schools and other key public services are left starved of resources as they are deprived of tax revenues, hitting women and girls hardest. There are reported details of further US tax reforms, in addition to the cut to corporation tax. Individual tax bands of 10%, 25% and 35% are being proposed, apparently: Here\u2019s a comparison of various countries\u2019 corporate tax rates: US markets have come to life ahead of the Trump tax announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 67 points and is just 100 points shy of its record high of 21,169 hit on 1 March this year. If the market likes what it hears from Trump\u2019s administration, that barrier could soon be breached. Meanwhile Nasdaq, which did hit a record high on Tuesday, has edged higher, with many of its technology constituents likely to benefit from the tax changes. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global markets have continued in a buoyant mood today, thanks to optimism about the impending tax reforms in the US. Despite a significant degree of political uncertainty still evident in Europe, there is a feeling that worst is over, with markets instead focusing on the Trump trade coming back into play. Unlike other more nuanced political and economic changes, a huge corporate tax cut would make a huge difference to the bottom line of US-based businesses. For investors, this impending shift in profitability is a huge attraction to invest in the US, and hence the outperformance of the American markets relative to Europe. Over in Greece, as long-stalled bailout negotiations finally resume, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been causing ripples warning that while parliament may legislate creditor-demanded reforms, the painful measures may never be implemented if the country isn\u2019t given debt relief. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports: With the timing of a maestro, Greece\u2019s leftist leader used the first day of reactivated bailout talks to deliver a stern message: without promised debt relief the pension cuts and tax hikes Athens has now agreed to as part of a bigger package to unlock further emergency loans will never be enforced. In a live TV interview aired late Tuesday, Tsipras said it was Greece\u2019s right as \u201cas sovereign government\u201d to reverse the measures (the equivalent of 2 % of GDP and due to be enacted as of 1.1.2019) if lenders didn\u2019t also honour pledges to offer medium-term debt relief that would allow the economy to breathe. \u201cThey will not be implemented if we do not have a solution to the debt,\u201d he told ANT 1 TV. While the controversial cuts worth \u20ac3.6bn would be approved by parliament in the coming weeks, Tsipras insisted it was within Greece\u2019s sovereign right \u201cto take back something that had been voted if the agreement wasn\u2019t upheld.\u201d Predicting that the progress review would be completed in time for the next eurogroup on May 22 \u2013 averting the prospect of crisis being replayed when Greece is called to meet \u20ac7.5bn of maturing debt in July \u2013 Tsipras argued that the review was no ordinary report card but part of a much broader agreement that would allow the country to finally recover from eight years of crisis. While Athens had been forced to make concessions, it had also won the ability to enforce \u201ccounter measures\u201d to offset losses when Greece hit budget targets and secured valuable labour rights that the IMF had wanted to abolish. \u201cWe must not see this review as a review that only concerns the bailout programme. It is the most critical review. Why? Because we have a comprehensive agreement,\u201d he said in the interview. Unlike the American Petroleum Institute figures out on Tuesday, the latest official figures on crude stocks show a surprise fall in inventories. The API said stocks rose last week by 897,000 barrels but figures from the Energy Information Administration show a weekly fall of 3.64m barrels to 528.7m. This is higher than the forecast fall of 1.7m barrels. Gasoline stocks however rose by 3.37m barrels compared to expectations of a 1m barrel fall. Brent crude, which had earlier fallen as low as $51.38 a barrel is now up 0.19% at $52.2. The API report is an industry one while the EIA is a government publication. Here is more on the two reports, which are often aligned but sometimes contradict each other. Investors are awaiting more details on the Trump tax plan, hence the muted reaction in the markets so far, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: Financial Analyst Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s confirmation that Donald Trump is seeking to cut corporation tax to just 15% did little for the markets this afternoon. Mnuchin echoed the President in an interview on CNBC, promising the \u2018biggest tax cut\u2019 and \u2018largest tax reform in US history\u2019. Yet this hyperbole was treated as just that by the Dow Jones, which nudged a mere 0.1% higher after the bell. Even the dollar was nonplussed, maintaining 0.3% and 0.5% rises against the euro and Japanese yen respectively while sitting flat against sterling. The fact investors failed to react to the Treasury Sec\u2019s headline tax cut announcement suggests that they are looking for more detail, especially the red flags that may cause any proposed bill to go the same way as Trump\u2019s healthcare reforms. There is also every chance that the bulk of the tax plan\u2019s market-boosting juice was used up yesterday, leaving little room for extra growth following the Mnuchin/Cohn press conference later this evening. Elsewhere oil prices are slipping back ahead of new official US crude inventory data from the Energy Information Administration. Earlier in the week industry figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude stockpiles rose by 897,000 barrels last week, compared to expectations of a 1.7m fall. The report indicated the difficulty producers are having in reducing supplies despite cuts in output, which have been offset by growing production from US shale companies. Brent crude is currently down nearly 1% at $51.60 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has dipped 0.8% to $49.16. Confirmation of at least one part of Donald Trump\u2019s US tax proposals - corporation tax cut to 15% - has done little for US markets, but at least they have opened higher rather than lower as originally expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 7 points while the S&amp;P 500 is virtually flat and Nasdaq Composite is 1.45 points better. Here\u2019s our first take on the proposed US tax reforms, with a corporation tax to 15% now confirmed by Treasury secretary Mnuchin: Here\u2019s more details of the Mnuchin interview, and some early reaction: Nice work by The Hill and CNBC there, getting early confirmation from the Treasury secretary about Trump\u2019s tax reform plans. Here\u2019s CNBC\u2019s early take: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that the tax plan the Trump administration will outline Wednesday afternoon will call for a 15% corporate rate. At an event hosted by The Hill, Mnuchin \u2014 who declined to go into many specifics about the proposal \u2014 contended it would be \u201cthe biggest tax cut and the largest tax reform in the history of our country.\u201d Mnuchin and White House chief economic advisor Gary Cohn are expected to go into more detail about the plan at a briefing later in the day. When Trump floated a 15 % corporate tax rate as a candidate, most analyses of the proposal estimated that it would balloon the deficit. It is unclear what the proposal would do to raise revenue to offset those major cuts, and Mnuchin declined to say how specifically the administration would pay for the 15% rate. Asked about the US debt ceiling, Steven Mnuchin says an agreement must be done in the fall (that\u2019s the autumn, UK readers) to create headroom for more borrowing. He doesn\u2019t want to get into the details of any potential deal, though. On the US economy, Mnuchin says he\u2019s confident that 3% per-year growth can be achieved [up from just 1.6% last year]. Newsflash: America\u2019s treasury secretary has just confirmed that Donald Trump wants to cut business taxes to just 15%. Speaking to CNBC ahead of today\u2019s official announcement, Steven Mnuchin says: I can confirm that the business tax rate will be 15%. This will deliver on Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to cut corporation tax, and stimulate growth and job creation, the Treasury secretary explains. The aim is to cut the taxes paid by small businesses, Mnuchin continues, rather than create a loophope for the rich. Mnuchin adds that the Trump administration want to simplify the US tax code. We have a fundamental agreement with Congress about tax reforms, Mnuchin explains, but the details need to be worked out. The interview is being streamed live here. Today\u2019s Wall Street open will be more whimper than bang, with the Dow expected to open broadly unchanged. The pound has taken the opportunity to claw back a little ground against the euro today, up 0.2% to \u20ac1.178. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: Sterling has bounced off a two-week low of \u20ac1.1718 versus the euro to trade around half a cent higher at \u20ac1.1771 by noon, although euro strength is generally still being underpinned by ongoing expectations that Emmanuel Macron will defeat Eurosceptic candidate Marine Le Pen in the second round of the French presidential elections on 7 May. Social networking site Twitter has defied its critics and posted better than expected financial result. Shares in Twitter are soaring in pre-market trading after it reported earnings of 11 cents per share (on a non-GAAP basis) up from the 1 cent per share which Wall Street expected. Twitter also signed up an extra 9 million users in the last quarter, and now has 6% more users than a year ago. But despite that, Twitter\u2019s revenues declined in the quarter to $548 million, down 8% on a year ago. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to report accelerating growth in daily active usage for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 14% year-over-year,\u201d said Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s CEO, warns that Twitter continues to face \u201crevenue headwinds\u201d, but believes it will return to positive revenue growth in the long term. Traders are optimistic; Twitter shares have surged by 11% in the New York grey market. Former UK prime minister David Cameron apparently told friends recently it was time to \u201cput some hay in the barn\u201d, after swapping Downing Street for the speaking circuit. By that measure, Barack Obama may need a second barn - after agreeing to give a speech to Cantor Fitzgerald for $400,000.... Newsflash: One of the employment agencies at the centre of the workplace problems at Sports Direct is preparing for insolvency. My colleague Simon Goodley explains: Transline, the temporary employment agency that became embroiled in the Sports Direct scandal, has submitted court documents preparing the company for insolvency. The Guardian understands that the business has filed a \u201cnotice of intention of appointing administrators\u201d at a court in Leeds, and has sounded out the accountancy firm Deloitte as a potential administrator. The \u201cnotice of intention to appointment\u201d is a device to give notice to secured creditors that there is a chance or prospect of an administration process. It also creates a moratorium around the business from action by creditors for 10 working days. Transline hit the headlines last year, over its \u2018six strikes\u2019 policy that penalised workers for trivial actions like \u2018excessive talking\u2019 or taking time off to nurse an ill child. It has also been facing backpay claims from Sports Direct staff who received less than the minimum wage, due to security checks. Here\u2019s the full story: It\u2019s been one of those mornings... It\u2019s been a good morning for Yorkshire-based chemicals company Croda. Shares in the FTSE-listed firm hit a record high this morning, up 4.8%, after it reported a blistering 19% jump in revenues in the last quarter. It confirms that UK companies are benefitting from the fall in sterling since the EU referendum (Croda\u2019s sales were only up 5% in \u2018constant currency\u2019 terms). Croda aren\u2019t exactly a household name, but its chemicals go into a swathe of products - from beauty products and Omega 3 fish oil to paints and adhesives. Is some UK economic data being leaked early, and is someone profiting from it? The Wall Street Journal has examined how the pound performs around major data releases, and found that it typically starts to move before the news hits the wires. That\u2019s fuelling concerns that some people may be illicitly profiting from embargoed information. The WSJ\u2019s Mike Bird explains: During the hour before unexpectedly strong or weak U.K. data is made public, the pound moved 0.065% versus the dollar on average in the same direction it subsequently did after those numbers came out, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Alexander Kurov, associate professor of finance at West Virginia University. It showed that the average change in the pound\u2019s value one hour before and after such economic data announcements is 0.127%, meaning around half the shift associated with the statistics came ahead of their official release This is significant because UK data is shared with a wide number of government insiders (from ministers to press officers) before it is released. This creates the potential for a leak -- unlike in Sweden, say, where no-one outside the statistics office gets a sniff before the official release. And the Swedish krona is much less likely to pre-empt a data announcement: More here: Are U.K. Traders Getting an Early Glimpse at Government Data? Currency Markets Suggest Yes Kathleen Brooks of City Index has released a very useful note outlining the Trump tax proposals, and the likely political hurdles. Here\u2019s a flavour: Will Congress back Trump this time? In theory this tax plan looks like it should extend the rally for US stocks. If taxes are slashed then some large US firms may re-base themselves back in the US to take advantage of the 15% rate, which might encourage them to engage in shareholder-friendly activities such as share buy-backs, larger dividends etc. However, stocks may pause on Wednesday as the market waits for the reaction from Congress who actually has to pass the bill. The pesky debt ceiling remains crucial problem for Congress The problem for the Republican -controlled Congress is the debt ceiling, which was breached back in March but has been massaged by some accounting measures until the end of this month. Congress is trying to pass a budget that will fund the Federal Government from 28th April, however, an unfunded tax cut from the Trump administration could add to the pressure on the debt ceiling going forward. Thus, Republicans have to balance their desire to reduce the Budget deficit, with their desire to boost the economy with a large cut to the corporate tax rate. If they do the latter, as many expect, then this could be a green light for US stock markets. Infrastructure plan, what infrastructure plan? This makes Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan, which has been suspiciously absent from the coverage of the tax blueprint, very unlikely to go ahead. The Trump team is likely to focus on the fact a tax cut can pay for itself and create jobs, but can it do that at the same pace of a large government-spending programme? On balance, we expect markets to outperform in the coming days if key members of Congress throw their weight behind Trump\u2019s tax proposals. But, if there are any signs that this won\u2019t get through the US legislature, then we could see big declines for US stocks. European stock markets will probably have closed before we hear details of Trump\u2019s tax proposals. According to The Hill, an announcement is expected at 1.30pm Washington time, or 6.30pm BST. They also predict that Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Director Gary Cohn will present the plans; Trump is busy holding a session on North Korea, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. After two solid days, European stock markets are taking a little breather. The UK, French and German indices have all dipped in early trading: Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms plans are the number one issue in the City today, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. He sounds a little sceptical about the whole thing, though: Currently, one major aspect of his plan which everyone is talking about is the corporate rate tax cut to 15% from its current rate of 35%. He can certainly cut that to 15% but that would only be good enough to produce a mammoth headline on the newswire. But, the question which you need to ask is how long it will take for that tax rate to become effective if it becomes effective at all. The market may go higher on the back of these flashy headlines but it will not take long before reality catches up with it. Last weekend\u2019s French elections continues to reassure traders, says Chris Weston of IG: It\u2019s a good time to hold equity and credit and it seems a dark cloud in the form of the French elections has swiftly departed from the investment landscape, combining effectively with headlines on Trump tax reform and in turn providing fresh impetus to chase returns. The prospect of sweeping tax reforms in America has helped to drive Asian stock markets higher today. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has closed 1% higher, and the other main indices are also gaining ground. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a buoyant mood in the markets today, keeping indices at their highest ever levels. Yesterday the MSCI World Index hit a record high, helped by optimism over European politics and hopes of chunky tax cuts in America. That sent Wall Street racing last night, with the Nasdaq hitting 6,000 points for the first time ever. And traders expect to hold onto these gains today: Three factors are working together to keep shares up, and thwart those who think the rally has gone two far. 1) The Europe effect. Investors seem pretty convinced that Emmanuel Macron will defeat Marine Le Pen on May 7th, and become France\u2019s next president. Cautious voices point out that Macron faces a serious struggle to get his reform agenda moving - especially if his En Marche! party don\u2019t make big wins in June\u2019s elections. 2) Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. The US president is expected to outline fiscal plans today, including slashing corporation tax from 35% to just 15%. That\u2019s alarmed some experts, with one estimating that it could cost $2 trillion in revenue. But lower taxes = higher profits = higher share prices. There\u2019s also optimism that a budget deal can be reached to prevent a government shutdown, with Trump apparently giving ground over his Mexican Wall plan: 3) Decent corporate earnings. Yesterday, fast food chain McDonald\u2019s and equipment maker Caterpillar both beat forecasts, bolstering hopes that the global economy is on firmer footings. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: US equity markets continues their sharp jump higher in anticipation of the Trump administration\u2019s tax reform announcement, with the tech-focused Nasdaq trading above 6,000 for the very first time, while both the S&amp;P500 and Dow Jones indices move closer to their respective all-time highs. Strong Q1 earnings performances from Caterpillar, McDonald\u2019s and DuPont led the Dow over 200 points higher, while the Materials sector led the S&amp;P to within 20 points of a fresh high. Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, agrees that \u201cConfidence has returned\u201d, adding: Markets seem a lot more relaxed. Globally, we\u2019re seeing a lot of risk-on.\u201d There\u2019s not much in the economic diary today. On the corporate front, the London Stock Exchange, Jupiter Fund Management, Metro Bank, chemicals firm Croda and German carmaker Daimler are reporting results this morning.

From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>With the timing of a maestro, Greece\u2019s leftist leader used the first day of reactivated bailout talks to deliver a stern message: without promised debt relief the pension cuts and tax hikes Athens has now agreed to as part of a bigger package to unlock further emergency loans will never be enforced. </p> <p>In a live TV interview aired late Tuesday, Tsipras said it was Greece\u2019s right as \u201cas sovereign government\u201d to reverse the measures (the equivalent of 2 % of GDP and due to be enacted as of 1.1.2019) if lenders didn\u2019t also honour pledges to offer medium-term debt relief that would allow the economy to breathe. </p> <p>\u201cThey will not be implemented if we do not have a solution to the debt,\u201d he told ANT 1 TV. While the controversial cuts worth \u20ac3.6bn would be approved by parliament in the coming weeks, Tsipras insisted it was within Greece\u2019s sovereign right \u201cto take back something that had been voted if the agreement wasn\u2019t upheld.\u201d </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8bf0670110dd0ffb0c75251f6cebabb0e57bfb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8bf0670110dd0ffb0c75251f6cebabb0e57bfb4/74_208_4204_2524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsipras\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsipras</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Predicting that the progress review would be completed in time for the next eurogroup on May 22 \u2013 averting the prospect of crisis being replayed when Greece is called to meet \u20ac7.5bn of maturing debt in July \u2013 Tsipras argued that the review was no ordinary report card but part of a much broader agreement that would allow the country to finally recover from eight years of crisis. </p> <p>While Athens had been forced to make concessions, it had also won the ability to enforce \u201ccounter measures\u201d to offset losses when Greece hit budget targets and secured valuable labour rights that the IMF had wanted to abolish. \u201cWe must not see this review as a review that only concerns the bailout programme.

Yet this hyperbole was treated as just that by the Dow Jones, which nudged a mere 0.1% higher after the bell. Even the dollar was nonplussed, maintaining 0.3% and 0.5% rises against the euro and Japanese yen respectively while sitting flat against sterling.</p> <p>The fact investors failed to react to the Treasury Sec\u2019s headline tax cut announcement suggests that they are looking for more detail, especially the red flags that may cause any proposed bill to go the same way as Trump\u2019s healthcare reforms.

If taxes are slashed then some large US firms may re-base themselves back in the US to take advantage of the 15% rate, which might encourage them to engage in shareholder-friendly activities such as share buy-backs, larger dividends etc.</p> <p>However, stocks may pause on Wednesday as the market waits for the reaction from Congress who actually has to pass the bill.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The pesky debt ceiling remains crucial problem for Congress</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The problem for the Republican -controlled Congress is the debt ceiling, which was breached back in March but has been massaged by some accounting measures until the end of this month. Congress is trying to pass a budget that will fund the Federal Government from 28th April, however, an unfunded tax cut from the Trump administration could add to the pressure on the debt ceiling going forward.</p> <p>Thus, Republicans have to balance their desire to reduce the Budget deficit, with their desire to boost the economy with a large cut to the corporate tax rate. If they do the latter, as many expect, then this could be a green light for US stock markets.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Infrastructure plan, what infrastructure plan?</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This makes Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan, which has been suspiciously absent from the coverage of the tax blueprint, very unlikely to go ahead. The Trump team is likely to focus on the fact a tax cut can pay for itself and create jobs, but can it do that at the same pace of a large government-spending programme?</p> <p>On balance, we expect markets to outperform in the coming days if key members of Congress throw their weight behind Trump\u2019s tax proposals. But, if there are any signs that this won\u2019t get through the US legislature, then we could see big declines for US stocks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5900540fe4b08d339d361e9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T08:04:20.447Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>European stock markets will probably have closed before we hear details of Trump\u2019s tax proposals.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/finance/330588-mnuchin-cohn-expected-to-roll-out-trump-tax-plan\">According to The Hill</a>, an announcement is expected at 1.30pm Washington time, or 6.30pm BST.</p> <p>They also predict that Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Director Gary Cohn will present the plans;<a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/trump-team-to-brief-senators-on-north-korea-at-white-house-10851205\"> Trump is busy holding a session on North Korea, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T09:20:32.170Z\">at 10.20am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-590050fee4b0e81396c86c6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T07:52:16.834Z\">8.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After two solid days, European stock markets are taking a little breather.</p> <p>The UK, French and German indices have all dipped in early trading:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d0f93f31e43ec5d5b2b46f30583afe2240ad85b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d0f93f31e43ec5d5b2b46f30583afe2240ad85b/0_0_919_287/500.jpg\" alt=\"European stock markets tis morning\" width=\"500\" height=\"156\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59004cc9e4b01972138ef82d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-26T07:38:46.660Z\">8.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms plans are the number one issue in the City today, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets.</strong></p> <p>He sounds a little sceptical about the whole thing, though:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Currently, one major aspect of his plan which everyone is talking about is the corporate rate tax cut to 15% from its current rate of 35%.

      "bodyText": "United Airlines has said a potentially record-breaking giant rabbit died in its care, but only after the transatlantic flight it was travelling on had landed. The 3ft (90cm) continental giant rabbit, which was 10 months old and named Simon, died while travelling from London Heathrow to O\u2019Hare airport in Chicago. The airline revealed it had offered the customer compensation and, contrary to previous reports, clarified that the animal was alive when it was taken off the flight. United\u2019s spokesman Charles Hobart said the animal had appeared healthy and shown no signs of distress upon landing. About 30 minutes later, he said, the rabbit was sleeping in a pet facility run by the company, and shortly afterwards an employee opened its cage to find it dead. It comes three weeks after a video showing a passenger being dragged off a United flight sparked widespread outrage. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the cause of death because we offered to perform a necropsy free of charge \u2013 that\u2019s standard procedure \u2013 but the customer didn\u2019t want us to perform a necropsy, and we understand,\u201d said Hobart. Owner Annette Edwards, a breeder from Worcestershire, told the Sun that Simon had been expected to grow to be the world\u2019s biggest rabbit after his father Darius grew to 4ft 4in (1.32 metres). She said his buyer was famous. She told the Associated Press: \u201cSimon had his vet check just before getting on the plane. He was fit as a fiddle.\u201d United says it is investigating the incident and a spokesperson said: \u201cWe were saddened to hear this news. The safety and wellbeing of all the animals that travel with us is of the utmost importance to United Airlines and our PetSafe team.\u201d This month David Dao, 69, from Kentucky, was seen with a bloodied face after being forcibly taken off a plane by Chicago airport officers who had been summoned by United employees when he would not give up his seat. Speaking after that incident, United\u2019s chief executive, Oscar Munoz, said: \u201cThe truly horrific event that occurred on this flight has elicited many responses from all of us: outrage, anger, disappointment. I share all of those sentiments and one above all: my deepest apologies for what happened. \u201cLike you, I continue to be disturbed by what happened on this flight and I deeply apologise to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard. No one should ever be mistreated this way.\u201d The most recent figures from the US Department of Transportation \u2013 dating from 2015 but released this February \u2013 show 35 animal deaths occurred during transit across 17 carriers in the US. United accounted for 14 animal deaths in that period, with a further nine reported injured among the nearly 100,000 animals carried by the company. Edwards also told the Sun: \u201cSomething very strange has happened and I want to know what. I\u2019ve sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before. The client who bought Simon is very famous. He\u2019s upset.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank has warned that up to 4,000 UK jobs could be moved to Frankfurt and other locations in the European Union as a result of Brexit. Germany\u2019s biggest bank employs 9,000 staff across the UK, including 7,000 in the City, and has called for clarity about how transactions worth billions of euros will be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU. \u201cFor front office people if you want to deal with EU clients you need to be based in the EU, in continental Europe. Does that mean that I have to move all the front office people to Germany or not?\u201d said Sylvie Matherat, Deutsche\u2019s chief regulatory officer. \u201cWe are speaking of 2,000 people \u2013 that\u2019s not a small number.\u201d She said another 2,000 jobs were at risk if regulators required banks to move the functions that support client activity \u2013 such as risk management. \u201cEverybody needs clarity \u2013 and the sooner the better,\u201d she said. Matherat gave no indication when a decision might be taken. Her remarks illustrate for the first time the scale of the problem that could be facing Deutsche Bank, which only last month committed to moving to a new London head office in 2023. The Bank of England has given financial firms a deadline of 14 July to explain how they are planning for the UK\u2019s departure from the EU and warned them to be ready for all possible outcomes, including a hard Brexit. The Bank wrote to hundreds of banks, insurers and other financial firms earlier this month, ordering them to get contingency plans in place. Financial centres across the EU \u2013 such as Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin \u2013 have been jostling for the jobs, offices and business that might be forced out of London once the UK leaves the EU. Estimates of how many jobs will be affected by Brexit range from tens of thousands to 232,000 financial services jobs across the UK. The triggering of article 50 last month \u2013 the formal process of leaving the EU \u2013 reignited speculation that financial jobs were at risk and was followed by an announcement by the insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London that it would set up a subsidiary in Brussels, where it it employs about 60 people. Other City employers are making plans. JP Morgan is considering buying office space in Dublin, and Citigroup has warned it may have to relocate \u201ccertain client-facing roles to the EU from the UK\u201d. Goldman Sachs has warned that hundreds of roles could change, while HSBC could switch 1,000 investment banking jobs from London to Paris. Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, told a conference in London that banks could have to start moving jobs within six months, and called for clarity on the status of EU nationals working in the UK. \u201cYou will start to see movement in a reasonably short period of time,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. The scale of the upheaval will depend on whether transactions denominated in euros can continue to take place through clearing houses in London. Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, told the BBC: \u201cI believe that there is an issue of sovereignty and security of European monetary markets and therefore the majority of the clearing houses cannot remain in London.\u201d",

Here in Pendle, in the Lancashire Pennines, our spending ability in the 10 years up to 2020 is being slashed by about half. With a net budget of about \u00a314m, we face another \u00a35m of cuts in the next three years. In 2010, we employed 450 people, a number that is now down to about 260. We have cut all useful but non-essential jobs, slashed the top management structure and pay, and seen many staff take a voluntary cut in working hours.

Firstly, campaigning for better services, and showing how they might be improved, is precisely part of what many charities do, with the approval of the Charity Commission. When Harris gets out his credit card for many charities, he is supporting such advocacy, so that the vulnerable are given visibility and voice. In the fields he mentions like international development, education, health and medicine and disability, many leading charities champion, rather than undermine, a rights-based approach. Secondly, as Beveridge recognised, state services alone will never be sufficient to meet all needs justly, to innovate as society changes, or give sufficient opportunities for participation and influence. Under any scenario of public spending, there will be ample space for a vibrant, assertive voluntary sector. Keep giving, John.

    "webTitle": "Energy bills: car insurance model will not help consumers, says charity", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An energy company\u2019s proposal to scrap default electricity and gas deals in favour of car insurance-style annual renewals could amount to a rebranding exercise and not help billpayers, a consumer group has said. Scottish Power, one of the big six energy suppliers, said the Conservative election pledge to cap standard variable tariffs may harm competition. Its chief corporate officer, Keith Anderson, instead urged the government to take the \u201cbold move\u201d of abolishing the deals in favour of a product that needs renewing each year. \u201cJust as you insure your car every year and go to the market for the best deal for you, so every energy customer should engage with the market at least once a year to make sure they are on the best deal for them,\u201d he said on Wednesday. But charity Citizens Advice said the idea could, in practice, amount to a rebadging of standard variable tariffs, which households default to at the end of better value fixed-term deals. \u201cSetting targets to get loyal customers on to cheaper fixed deals would be a helpful step for suppliers to take,\u201d said the charity\u2019s chief executive, Gillian Guy. \u201cBut questions remain about what happens to customers\u2019 bills when those deals end. \u201cJust abolishing the standard variable tariff could end up with it being recreated in all but name as the more expensive tariff that people are automatically rolled on to at the end of their fixed term.\u201d Anderson had suggested that all households be moved to fixed deals by the end of 2019, with price caps imposed on any companies that failed to meet this deadline. Five of the big six have increased standard variable tariffs in recent months, with EDF raising them twice, prompting ministers to promise to save 17 million families \u00a3100 a year through a price cap. Scottish Power\u2019s alternative proposal, similar to one previously put to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) by British Gas, received a warmer reception from analysts, personal finance experts and comparison sites. Martin Lewis, the founder of Money Saving Expert, said an annual \u201ccall to action\u201d could increase engagement in the market for the two-thirds of people on standard variable tariffs. \u201cI don\u2019t think structurally this would be much different \u2013 the key is to make it behaviourally different,\u201d he said. Jon Ferris, the strategy director at Utilitywise, said the idea was an \u201cinteresting alternative\u201d, but doubted that annual renewal letters would increase consumer engagement.

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has appointed a retired high court judge to investigate its handling of fraud at its HBOS branch in Reading. The bank also announced that it will start making compensation payments next month to customers who lost out as a result of the incident. Six people were jailed in February after a jury was told how they spent the proceeds on superyachts and sex parties. The findings of the investigation by Dame Linda Dobbs, who retired as a judge four years ago, will be shared with the Financial Conduct Authority, although it is not clear whether it will be published. Earlier this month the regulator announced it was looking at the period when HBOS discovered the activities in the Reading branch. Dobbs will focus on whether Lloyds investigated the problems in Reading and reported them to the authorities when it rescued HBOS during the depths of the financial crisis. The combined bank was bailed out with \u00a320.3bn of taxpayers\u2019 money, but last week Philip Hammond said the government had recouped its cash by selling off its stake from 43% to less than 2%. Announcing the appointment of Dobbs, Lloyds said: \u201cDame Linda, a retired high court judge, has been selected for her considerable experience of working on fraud cases and track record of chairing enquiries. This independent assessment will cover the period following HBOS\u2019s acquisition in January 2009, through to the conclusion of the criminal trial on 30 January 2017.\u201d Dobbs, who was Britain\u2019s first black female high court judge, conducted the BBC\u2019s investigation into abuse by the presenter Stuart Hall. Lloyds would not say how long her investigation is expected to take, but indicated that it would not cause any further delay to compensation payments due to 64 customers. The bank has set aside \u00a3100m to cover them. Professor Russel Griggs has been reviewing the cases and Lloyds expects the victims to receive their payments by the end of June. Among them are Paul and Nikki Turner, whose publishing business, Zenith, was run into the ground by the scam. They spent 10 years investigating the way their business was treated by Lynden Scourfield, the former HBOS banker who was jailed along with his business associate David Mills. Nikki Turner said Dobbs and Griggs were not independent and that Lloyds was not paying out enough to the victims. \u201cThe compensation estimate is far too low, as it is predicated on 64 victims and there is clear evidence that over 250 businesses lost out because of this fraud,\u201d she said. \u201cThe timeframe, though on the face of it more rapid than other redress offers by banks, should be seen against the background of more than a decade of prevarication and denial by the bank. We have said we do not want to be included in the review and call on Lloyds to act immediately to alleviate the distress of those who have suffered for far too long.\u201d Scourfield was sentenced to 11 years and three months. He pleaded guilty to the scheme, which involved introducing his small business clients to Mills, who was convicted along with his wife Alison and their associates Michael Bancroft and Tony Cartwright of running the fraud between 2003 and 2007. Mark Dobson, another HBOS banker who used to work under Scourfield, was also found guilty. A seventh man, accountant Jonathan Cohen, was acquitted.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Transline, the temporary employment agency that became embroiled in the Sports Direct scandal, has submitted court documents preparing the company for insolvency. The business has filed a \u201cnotice of intention of appointing administrators\u201d at a court in Leeds, and has sounded out the accountancy firm Deloitte as a potential administrator. The \u201cnotice of intention to appointment\u201d is a device to give notice to secured creditors that there is a chance or prospect of an administration process. It also creates a moratorium around the business from action by creditors for 10 working days. The move comes after Transline was one of two employment agencies exposed by a 2015 Guardian investigation of paying temporary workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse less than the national minimum wage. It also follows the firm being axed last month from supplying temporary warehousing staff to the world\u2019s largest retailer Amazon, and comes two weeks after the company announced that Colin Beasley \u2013 who was the majority shareholder when the group founded - had left its board. A Transline spokesperson said: \u201cThe company has suffered as a result of a continued move to tighter margins in the recruitment industry. We are close to securing inward investment that will allow us to drive forward with continued growth and infrastructure development, and have lodged the \u2018notice of intention\u2019 to protect the business, our employees and our customers as we complete this process. \u201cThe welfare of our staff and our relationships with our customers are of paramount importance, and we are continuing our service and operations as normal. We expect to hear more regarding potential trading investments imminently.\u201d The comment appeared to be a direct contradiction of a statement made by the company on 28 March when, having been asked about the company\u2019s finances, a Transline spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cThere is no imminent need for funds within the business, but we are committed to building the scale and size of our company, whilst ensuring the well-being of all our employees is a driving force in our work.\u201d The employment agency has had a torrid 16 months since the publication of the Guardian\u2019s investigation into working conditions at Sports Direct, which resulted in a deal where the retailer, Transline and a second agency, The Best Connection, agreed to make about \u00a31m available in back pay to affected workers. However, it emerged at a parliamentary select committee hearing last month that Transline has failed to honour part of that deal, leaving scores of workers who were paid less than the legal minimum without the back pay they are owed for their shifts. The payments were to be backdated to May 2012, although Transline has not yet refunded unpaid wages from before it took over workers at the site from a rival agency, Blue Arrow, in 2014. The March parliamentary hearing was the second time Transline had been called to appear in front of MPs in less than a year, with the first hearing ending disastrously for the company when its finance director, Jennifer Hardy, was accused of misleading parliament. Her evidence provoked Iain Wright, Labour MP and chair of the House of Commons business, innovation and skills select committee, to call on Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority shareholder, Mike Ashley, to consider axing Transline, which he said had not been candid about the reasons for its lack of an operating licence from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, an industry watchdog. Transline denied it had misled MPs. Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the union Unite, said: \u201cThe current uncertainty surrounding Transline\u2019s future is yet more evidence of the need for Sports Direct to wean itself off its over reliance on temporary agency workers at its Shirebrook warehouse. Sports Direct must urgently move to put agency workers onto permanent contracts to bring security to the workforce and certainty to the business. \u201cTransline must not be allowed to dodge its responsibilities or the back pay it owes for non-payment of the minimum wage at Sports Direct. It must continue to pay the wages of the tens of thousands of low paid agency workers it currently employs across the UK. A failure to do so would be the final insult for the many workers it has exploited through its draconian work practices.\u201d Deloitte and Sports Direct declined to comment.",

We expect to hear more regarding potential trading investments imminently.\u201d</p> <p>The comment appeared to be a direct contradiction of a statement made by the company on 28 March when, having been asked about the company\u2019s finances, a Transline spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cThere is no imminent need for funds within the business, but we are committed to building the scale and size of our company, whilst ensuring the well-being of all our employees is a driving force in our work.\u201d</p> <p>The employment agency has had a torrid 16 months since the publication of the Guardian\u2019s investigation into working conditions at Sports Direct, which resulted in a deal where the retailer, Transline and a second agency, The Best Connection, agreed to make about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/15/sports-direct-staff-to-receive-back-pay-unite-hmrc\">\u00a31m available in back pay to affected workers</a>.</p> <p>However, it emerged at a parliamentary select committee hearing last month that Transline has failed to honour part of that deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/28/sports-direct-workers-yet-to-receive-backpay-transline-mps-told\">leaving scores of workers who were paid less than the legal minimum without the back pay they are owed for their shifts</a>.</p> <p>The payments were to be backdated to May 2012, although Transline has not yet refunded unpaid wages from before it took over workers at the site from a rival agency, Blue Arrow, in 2014.</p> <p>The March parliamentary hearing was the second time Transline had been called to appear in front of MPs in less than a year, with the first hearing ending disastrously for the company when its finance director, Jennifer Hardy, was accused of misleading parliament.</p> <p>Her evidence provoked Iain Wright, Labour MP and chair of the House of Commons business, innovation and skills select committee, to call on Sports Direct\u2019s founder and majority shareholder, Mike Ashley, to consider axing Transline, which he said had not been candid about the reasons for its lack of an operating licence from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, an industry watchdog. </p> <p>Transline denied it had misled MPs.</p> <p>Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the union Unite, said: \u201cThe current uncertainty surrounding Transline\u2019s future is yet more evidence of the need for Sports Direct to wean itself off its over reliance on temporary agency workers at its Shirebrook warehouse. Sports Direct must urgently move to put agency workers onto permanent contracts to bring security to the workforce and certainty to the business.</p> <p>\u201cTransline must not be allowed to dodge its responsibilities or the back pay it owes for non-payment of the minimum wage at Sports Direct. It must continue to pay the wages of the tens of thousands of low paid agency workers it currently employs across the UK. A failure to do so would be the final insult for the many workers it has exploited through its draconian work practices.\u201d</p> <p>Deloitte and Sports Direct declined to comment.<br></p>",

The victim of that occasion was a hapless Lord Stevenson, who had failed to explain adequately how HBOS had sunk on his chairmanship. Tyrie called him \u201cdelusional\u201d as well as \u201cevasive, repetitive and unrealistic\u201d. After the catastrophe of the 2008 banking crash, such language was exactly what was required. Tyrie was a tenacious interrogator who believed in proper accountability in boardrooms. The insults only flowed when the witnesses had dug their own holes. Now he is leaving parliament, a surprise announcement that should depress anyone who has listened to hours of select committee hearings over the years. As chair of the Treasury committee, and also the parliamentary commission on banking standards, Tyrie says he\u2019s \u201cdone what I can to make a contribution, particularly in efforts to improve banking standards and to shape a more trusted and resilient financial sector\u201d. He\u2019s achieved a lot. The Treasury committee\u2019s backing for the ring-fencing legislation in the 2012 Banking Act was vital. It then acted as a strong safeguard against bankers\u2019 many attempts to water down the implementation of rules. He also helped to improve scrutiny of the Bank of England, another shortcoming exposed by the crash. He\u2019ll be missed, as many MPs agreed on Tuesday. He led the way in restoring the power of select committees, one of his pet causes. The good news is that Tyrie remains \u201cdeeply committed to public service\u201d and, at the age of 60, wants to contribute outside parliament. Put him on the court of the Bank of England, for starters. He knows more about governance and the inner workings of Threadneedle Street than most members of the governing body. And, after the Treasury committee\u2019s central role in the recent downfall of deputy governor Charlotte Hogg, it would be classy move by the Bank. Whitbread\u2019s German venture needs time to bed in Whitbread enjoyed \u201canother year of strong growth,\u201d declared chief executive Alison Brittain. Up to a point. It\u2019s true there was nothing slow about the progress in revenues at Whitbread\u2019s two big formats \u2013 Premier Inn\u2019s turnover was 9% better and Costa Coffee\u2019s almost 11%. It\u2019s just that, as one goes down the profit and loss account, the numbers aren\u2019t as sparkling as they used to be. Profit before tax (\u00a3565m) and earnings per share improved by 6%, and the dividend was lifted similarly. Nobody is going to moan too much about 6%, but \u201cstrong growth\u201d at Whitbread used to mean double digits. In terms of earnings and dividends, it has achieved that score every year in the past five until now. Two years ago it was close to 20%. The pace of expansion becomes harder to sustain when the numbers get bigger, of course. It\u2019s also the case that Brittain is conducting a necessary and expensive overhaul of back-office IT systems and suchlike to ensure Whitbread can handle its greater size. That strategy seems perfectly sensible \u2013 but it\u2019s not designed for short-term excitement, especially in a \u201ctougher consumer environment,\u201d as the company described current conditions. To judge by the 7% fall in share price, some investors are struggling to accept the new reality. They should be more patient. Forget about immediate prospects and concentrate on the tentative bet on Germany with Premier Inn. If it can crack the German market, after a flop in India, Whitbread will be back to the races \u2013 but it could take five years before progress can be judged.

Yes, but Yahoo did all those things about a decade and a half ago. Then it was overtaken by Google, Facebook and others. Mayer arrived on the scene in 2012 and her reign, like most of her immediate predecessors\u2019, was about trying to recover former glories. She failed, as they did, and the sale to Verizon was almost an act of mercy. The fact that Mayer could now walk away with a $186m (\u00a3145m) payoff plus $200m of salary over five years is extraordinary. It\u2019s the US, and it\u2019s tech, but the sum is ridiculous.

      "bodyText": "The French state railway SNCF is to partner with Virgin Trains for a bid to run the first HS2 high-speed trains. The competition for the West Coast Partnership franchise will pit the Virgin, Stagecoach and SNCF consortium against First Group and the Italian state-owned Trenitalia, with other potential bidders still to come forward. The winner will run the existing intercity service on the main line from London to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow from 2019, as well as the new high-speed services when they come into operation in about 2026. The Department for Transport has stipulated that all bidders must have experience of running high-speed trains, which has obliged Virgin to bring SNCF on board. Stagecoach is taking a 50% share, SNCF 30% and Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin 20%. The RMT, which has long argued the irony of Britain\u2019s rail being contracted to private sector firms that are owned by foreign governments, denounced the news as a French \u201clandgrab\u201d. The union\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cThis is yet another landgrab on Britain\u2019s railways by the French state with SNCF and Richard Branson both realising that this new franchise will be a one-way ticket to the bank for whoever comes out on top in this latest UK rail lottery. \u201cThe integrated HS2/west coast operation has been bought and paid for by the British people and should be run by the British state in the public interest and not by some consortium of speculators looking to make a killing at the taxpayer\u2019s expense.\u201d As well as representing a lucrative prize \u2013 Branson and Stagecoach have shared dividends worth more than \u00a3500m from the west coast service alone since 1997 \u2013 the contest will see First Group and Virgin square up in a repeat of the 2012 bidding war that derailed rail franchising in Britain. First was briefly awarded the contract for the west coast franchise before a legal challenge from Virgin exposed flaws in the DfT\u2019s process, leading to Branson and Stagecoach eventually retaining the service in a series of direct awards. Virgin will hope that the addition of SNCF, which operates a fleet of 430 high-speed trains across Europe, will put it in pole position to retain its franchise and run the new HS2 services. First partner Trenitalia\u2019s Italian network includes a spine served by Frecciarossa high-speed trains. Martin Griffiths, the chief executive of Stagecoach, said: \u201cThis creates a powerful world-class partnership, bringing together the team which has transformed intercity rail travel in the UK with the most recognised and capable high-speed operator in Europe.\u201d Guillaume Pepy, the chairman of SNCF, said it would build on the French rail firm\u2019s \u201clongstanding commitment of working in partnership with British companies, using their local knowledge and sharing our expertise and experience\u201d. The first phase of the HS2 route to Birmingham is due to be up and running by 2026 and for a period after that trains will continue north on the existing west coast line, until the rest of the high-speed network is completed. The shortlist of bidders will be confirmed in June, and the winner selected next year.",

First partner Trenitalia\u2019s Italian network includes a spine served by Frecciarossa high-speed trains.</p> <p>Martin Griffiths, the chief executive of Stagecoach, said: \u201cThis creates a powerful world-class partnership, bringing together the team which has transformed intercity rail travel in the UK with the most recognised and capable high-speed operator in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>Guillaume Pepy, the chairman of SNCF, said it would build on the French rail firm\u2019s \u201clongstanding commitment of working in partnership with British companies, using their local knowledge and sharing our expertise and experience\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The first phase of the HS2 route to Birmingham is due to be up and running by 2026 and for a period after that trains will continue north on the existing west coast line, until the rest of the high-speed network is completed. </p> <p>The shortlist of bidders will be confirmed in June, and the winner selected next year.</p>",
