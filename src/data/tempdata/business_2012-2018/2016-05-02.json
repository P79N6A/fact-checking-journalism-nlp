      "bodyText": "Some of the largest food producers in the US have successfully petitioned Congress to propose a change to the Freedom of Information Act that would shield their communications with boards overseen by the US Department of Agriculture from the scrutiny of the public, the Guardian has learned. The move follows a series of stories that showed the government-backed egg promoter, the American Egg Board, had attempted to stifle competition from Silicon Valley food startup Hampton Creek, in direct conflict with its mandate. Several agricultural lobbyists including United Egg Producers, the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association and the National Pork Producers Council have now sent a letter to the congressional subcommittee overseeing appropriations for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) asking to be exempted from Foia requests to their own respective promotional boards. The letter to the subcommittee reads, in part: We support inclusion of language in the Committee report urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to recognize that the research and promotion programs are funded solely with producer dollars, and therefore are not agencies of the Federal government or subject to the Freedom of Information Act (Foia). The language added to the bill reads thusly: The Committee notes that the commodity Research and Promotion boards that the agency oversees are not agencies of the federal government, nor are Research and Promotion programs funded with federal funds. The funding used to operate and carry out the activities of the various Research and Promotion programs is provided by producers and industry stakeholders, and employees of the boards are not federal employees. Therefore, the Committee urges USDA to recognize that such boards are not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Section 552. The bill has not yet been passed. The government-backed food marketing groups are called \u201ccheckoff\u201dprograms, dedicated to promoting individual commodities and backed by a levy on farmers. Their most recognizable presence is in the form of marketing slogans such as \u201cThe incredible, edible egg\u201d or \u201cBeef. It\u2019s what\u2019s for dinner\u201d. The administrators of checkoff programs are appointed by the USDA and the programs themselves are funded by a levy on goods sold. The supreme court has ruled that contributing to the programs is mandatory, and that the programs themselves constitute government speech. That decision was controversial \u2013 small producers have long argued that checkoffs exclusively serve the interests of the their largest competitors, and environmental and animal rights activists say checkoffs often obscure the cruelties of industrial farming. Last year the Guardian learned through a Freedom of Information Act request by attorney Jeffrey Light and Foia expert Ryan Shapiro that the USDA-backed American Egg Board (the egg industry checkoff) had advised Unilever on an ongoing lawsuit against Hampton Creek, a company that produces plant-based mayonnaise, and had agreed to attempt to use its influence to have Hampton Creek\u2019s Just Mayo removed from Whole Foods. Shapiro said the attempt to cast a shroud over shady dealings among checkoff groups came far too late. \u201cNow that some of their blatantly improper dealings have been exposed via Foia, instead of cleaning up their acts, these boards are attempting to exempt themselves from Foia altogether,\u201d Shapiro told the Guardian. \u201cBut as the already released documents demonstrate, these boards are sorely in need of greater transparency and must not be allowed to shroud their already opaque dealings with even more secrecy.\u201d The Foia expert also observed that no less a pro-business titan than the late Antonin Scalia would have disagreed with the producers\u2019 assessment of their own accountability. In a ruling slapping down a challenge to the checkoff programs\u2019 authority by a group of small farmers, Scalia wrote of the beef checkoff: \u201cThe program is authorized and the basic message prescribed by federal statute, and specific requirements for the promotions\u2019 content are imposed by federal regulations promulgated after notice and comment. The Secretary of Agriculture, a politically accountable official, oversees the program, appoints and dismisses the key personnel, and retains absolute veto power over the advertisements\u2019 content, right down to the wording.\u201d The proposed rule comes at an awkward time for its supporters: the US federal government is in the midst of a review across its entire breadth after a call for greater Foia responsiveness and accessibility. As recently as last week, a letter to US comptroller general Gene L Dodaro, signed by the leadership of both the house and senate judiciary committees, asked the Government Accountability Office to audit agencies for compliance. Josh Tetrick, CEO of Hampton Creek, said the proposed Foia exemption was an example of how far the food industry remains removed from everyday Americans. \u201cYou don\u2019t just wake up one morning with a food system that doesn\u2019t reflect our values,\u201d Tetrick said. \u201cIt happens over decades.\u201d Indeed, displeasure with the move appears to cross party lines. \u201cThis is crony capitalism organized by Washington at its worst,\u201d said Republican senator Mike Lee in an emailed statement. \u201cNot only is the federal government forcing market participants to collude, it is then actively engaging in a cover up of that collusion.\u201d This article has been updated to clarify the nature of checkoff programs",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Its high street stores are meccas of overpriced tat with piles of cuddly Nemo fishes, plastic lightsabres and polyester princess outfits that send girls into a frenzy. With recent cartoon blockbusters such as Frozen, Disney has tightened its hold over children\u2019s hearts but now it is targeting their parents too, by pitching a clothing and homeware empire aimed squarely at adults. \u201cWe did a lot of consumer research and discovered there was huge demand for adult product from Disney,\u201d said Francesca Gianesin, who heads up fashion and lifestyle for the Europe, Middle East and Asia region for Disney Consumer Products. \u201cWhen we see a movie, the first thing we think is will there be an emotional connection? What is it men and women would like to feel by wearing pieces of that movie?\u201d The division is already enjoying a strong run, with sales up 13% to $4.5bn (\u00a33bn) last year as cinema-goers snapped up Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars-related T-shirts, toys and lunch boxes. But the target audience is not the fancy dress party goer \u2013 at the clothing and homeware event Disney held at Somerset House last week there wasn\u2019t a pair of Mickey Mouse-style suspender shorts or a Cinderella costume with battery-operated lights in sight. Gianesin is wearing a Fausto Puglisi tunic inspired by the Captain America franchise, and is channelling superhero rather than Disney princess. \u201cIt\u2019s about empowerment because I\u2019m a superhero,\u201d the Italian explained. \u201cI\u2019m wearing Captain America and I\u2019m a woman, and I want to be seen as strong.\u201d More than 1,000 fashion industry professionals trooped to the event at Somerset House, a glamorous neoclassical building on the Strand in central London, which with its cobbled square and dancing fountains is often a hangout during London fashion week. In an industry always hungry for new ideas, Disney serves up a huge archive for fashion folk to plunder: from the drawings that were the genesis of classic 1930s and 1940s animations such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Bambi to storyboards and props from the most recent Marvel films. Enthusiasm for the event was underlined by key figures such as Sandra Choi, creative director of Jimmy Choo, and Geoffroy de La Bourdonnaye, president of Chlo\u00e9, taking part in a panel debate on the \u201cpower of storytelling\u201d. It is only the second time Disney has courted the fashion industry in this way, with last year\u2019s show based on mock-ups created by Disney designers. This year several galleries were packed with the Disney-inspired output of high-end clothing designers ranging from Preen to Anya Hindmarch and Marc Jacobs as well as more accessible fashions such as a \u00a3145 pair of tiger-print Reebok trainers, inspired by its Jungle Book remake. Disney grants character licences for use on everything from toys to clothing and food, earning royalties on the wholesale or retail price. Its hottest properties include Frozen, Mickey and Minnie, Marvel\u2019s The Avengers and Spider-Man \u2013 and, lest we forget, the Disney Princesses. The broad appeal of Disney is clear: its own stores sell a pair of Cinderella \u201clight up\u201d shoe for \u00a316, while a bespoke pair, decorated with thousands of Swarovski crystals, can be ordered from Jimmy Choo for just under \u00a33,000. Gianesin has reorganised her staff to create a Disney Living team, signalling an ambition to conquer the fragmented homewares market, with its characters ripe for use on everything from cushions to crockery and tea towels. Walt Disney logged the colours used to paint each character in its now classic animations, handing the company a paintbox filled with shades such as \u201cScat cat\u201d purple (from The Aristocats) and \u201cshine on ice\u201d from Bambi. Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence at trend forecaster WGSN, said demand for \u201cnovelty and nostalgia done well\u201d should not be underestimated. \u201cThere is a constant need for newness and storytelling in a fashion market that is quite stagnant at the moment,\u201d she explained. \u201cDisney is an iconic brand and part of the story of how we have grown up. There are lots of stories for brands to play with.\u201d With a market value of $170bn, Walt Disney\u2019s other interests include TV channels as well as the famous theme parks and film studios. Its arsenal of film rights was boosted by the purchase of Lucasfilm, the company behind Star Wars, in 2012, having swallowed Pixar, the animation firm behind Toy Story, and Marvel Comics in the 2000s. \u201cWhether you have children or not, it\u2019s all about the emotional connection,\u201d added Gianesin. \u201cLuxury brands create new trends that move through the pyramid from luxury to trend-market to mid-market to mass market, even discount. We are part of pop culture. There are so many properties and characters that are timeless and relevant to different consumers.\u201d",

But the target audience is not the fancy dress party goer \u2013 at the clothing and homeware event Disney held at Somerset House last week there wasn\u2019t a pair of Mickey Mouse-style suspender shorts or a Cinderella costume with battery-operated lights in sight.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/28/disney-launches-avengers-fashion-line-for-women\">Gianesin is wearing a Fausto Puglisi tunic inspired by the Captain America franchise</a>, and is channelling superhero rather than Disney princess. \u201cIt\u2019s about empowerment because I\u2019m a superhero,\u201d the Italian explained. \u201cI\u2019m wearing Captain America and I\u2019m a woman, and I want to be seen as strong.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dc2d5eaa338e0c8933e39d753c32f3863f1b462\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dc2d5eaa338e0c8933e39d753c32f3863f1b462/0_786_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francesca Gianesin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francesca Gianesin at Disney\u2019s annual Lifestyle event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 1,000 fashion industry professionals trooped to the event at Somerset House, a glamorous neoclassical building on the Strand in central London, which with its cobbled square and dancing fountains is often a hangout during London fashion week.</p> <p>In an industry always hungry for new ideas, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/28/dolce-gabbana-dresses-fit-for-disney-approved-princesses\">Disney serves up a huge archive for fashion folk to plunder</a>: from the drawings that were the genesis of classic 1930s and 1940s animations such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Bambi to storyboards and props from the most recent Marvel films.</p> <p> Enthusiasm for the event was underlined by key figures such as Sandra Choi, creative director of Jimmy Choo, and Geoffroy de La Bourdonnaye, president of Chlo\u00e9, taking part in a panel debate on the \u201cpower of storytelling\u201d.</p> <p>It is only the second time Disney has courted the fashion industry in this way, with last year\u2019s show based on mock-ups created by Disney designers. This year several galleries were packed with the Disney-inspired output of high-end clothing designers ranging from Preen to Anya Hindmarch and Marc Jacobs as well as more accessible fashions such as a \u00a3145 pair of tiger-print Reebok trainers, inspired by its Jungle Book remake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f024a7ba908743881de4693b83e06821faa3571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f024a7ba908743881de4693b83e06821faa3571/0_205_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Disney\u2019s annual Lifestyle event at Somerset House, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disney\u2019s annual Lifestyle event at Somerset House, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Disney grants character licences for use on everything from toys to clothing and food, earning royalties on the wholesale or retail price. Its hottest properties include Frozen, Mickey and Minnie, Marvel\u2019s The Avengers and Spider-Man \u2013 and, lest we forget, the Disney Princesses. The broad appeal of Disney is clear: its own stores sell a pair of Cinderella \u201clight up\u201d shoe for \u00a316, while a bespoke pair, decorated with thousands of Swarovski crystals, can be ordered from Jimmy Choo for just under \u00a33,000.</p> <p>Gianesin has reorganised her staff to create a Disney Living team, signalling an ambition to conquer the fragmented homewares market, with its characters ripe for use on everything from cushions to crockery and tea towels. Walt Disney logged the colours used to paint each character in its now classic animations, handing the company a paintbox filled with shades such as \u201cScat cat\u201d purple (from The Aristocats) and \u201cshine on ice\u201d from Bambi.</p> <p>Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence at trend forecaster WGSN, said demand for \u201cnovelty and nostalgia done well\u201d should not be underestimated. \u201cThere is a constant need for newness and storytelling in a fashion market that is quite stagnant at the moment,\u201d she explained. \u201cDisney is an iconic brand and part of the story of how we have grown up. There are lots of stories for brands to play with.\u201d</p> <p>With a market value of $170bn, Walt Disney\u2019s other interests include TV channels as well as the famous theme parks and film studios. Its arsenal of film rights was boosted by the purchase of Lucasfilm, the company behind Star Wars, in 2012, having swallowed Pixar, the animation firm behind Toy Story, and Marvel Comics in the 2000s.</p> <p>\u201cWhether you have children or not, it\u2019s all about the emotional connection,\u201d added Gianesin. \u201cLuxury brands create new trends that move through the pyramid from luxury to trend-market to mid-market to mass market, even discount. We are part of pop culture. There are so many properties and characters that are timeless and relevant to different consumers.\u201d</p>",

Hot beverages are only served in the first three sizes. \u201cIn essence, Starbucks is advertising the size of its cold drink cups on its menu, rather than the amount of fluid a customer will receive when they purchase a cold drink \u2013 and deceiving its customers in the process,\u201d states the lawsuit. Pincus\u2019s complaint also takes issue with the company\u2019s pricing system, which includes higher prices for cold drinks. Since hot drinks do not include ice and cost less, she argues, Starbucks is making more money off of customers buying iced drinks. Starbucks believes that the lawsuit is without merit. \u201cOur customers understand and expect that ice is an essential component of any \u2018iced\u2019 beverage. If a customer is not satisfied with their beverage preparation, we will gladly remake it,\u201d Jamie Riley, a spokesperson for Starbucks, told CNN. Starbucks customers who desire less ice in their beverages have also been known to ask for \u201clight\u201d ice when placing their orders. \u201cYou can order light ice or extra ice on any of our iced beverages,\u201d the company tweeted last April. The lawsuit filed by Pincus is to apply to anyone who has purchased an iced beverage in the past 10 years. According to the complaint, the claims could exceed $5m.",

At a time when the amount of revolts in this year\u2019s annual general meeting season are coming thicker and faster than those in recent years, the Norway oil fund has revealed it is preparing to target high pay. Yngve Slyngstad, chief executive of the fund, told the Financial Times that the absolute level of pay \u2013 not just the way deals were structured \u2013 was becoming an issue. \u201cWe have so far looked at this in a way that has focused on pay structures rather than pay levels. We think, due to the way the issue of executive remuneration has developed, that we will have to look at what an appropriate level of executive remuneration is as well,\u201d said Slyngstad. The Norges Bank Investment Management is so large that it holds stakes in most major companies. It supported the controversial pay deal for BP\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley, which was voted against by a majority of investors but, according to the FT, the fund voted against pay at Anglo American and also at Weir. Weir has faced the largest rebellion of this AGM season and was forced to abandon potential share awards for its top management team, after 72.4% of shareholders voted against its pay policies. \u201cWe are looking at how to approach this issue in the public space. We will choose the right instance for the right case of voting,\u201d Slyngstad said. The remarks by Slyngstad come as a long list of London-listed companies prepare to hold their AGMs over the coming days, including Reckitt Benckiser, whose chief executive was paid \u00a323m in 2015, double the amount the year before. Two banks, Standard Chartered and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, along with Rolls-Royce, GlaxoSmithKline and hedge fund Man Group, are also holding meetings. Data compiled by the corporate governance consultancy ISS Corporate Solutions (ICS) shows that two pay deals have already secured \u201cno\u201d votes \u2013 those at BP and Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 compared with none by this stage over the previous three years. \u201cThe average level of dissent for advisory remuneration report resolutions across the FTSE All Share continues to outpace that evidenced in recent years,\u201d said Stephan Costa, executive director at ICS. \u201cMore critically, we are seeing companies failing to secure majority support with others narrowly passing, thereby underscoring the depth and breadth of investor sentiments on pay this annual meeting season,\u201d Costa said. The AGM season continues for a number of more weeks yet, when major companies hold their investor meetings, including WPP, the advertising company which confirmed last week that its chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, had been paid \u00a370.4m in 2015. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2016 to give the full name of ISS Corporate Solutions",

      "bodyText": "The MP leading an analysis into the collapse of BHS has lashed out at its former owner Sir Philip Green over the sale of the business to people who \u201ccrash[ed] it into a cliff\u201d. The retail billionaire, his wife Tina and Anthony Grabiner, chairman of Green\u2019s retail empire Arcadia for more than a decade, are being asked to appear before two parliamentary committees to give evidence about the high street chain\u2019s demise. Iain Wright MP, who chairs the Commons business, innovation and skills select committee, said Green had \u201cenormous questions\u201d to answer. Wright highlighted the sale of the business to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt who bought BHS via a company called Retail Acquisitions last year. He said: \u201cThe question that we want to ask Sir Philip Green is, \u2018You bought BHS, took enormous sums out of the business, the pension scheme went from surplus to deficit and then you sold it for a pound to somebody who was twice bankrupt and who had no experience whatsoever of the retail sector \u2013 is that appropriate stewardship of a big, important company?\u2019\u201d Retail Acquisitions argues that it spent \u00a310,000,001 to buy BHS, because it invested \u00a310m in shares on top of the deal\u2019s notional \u00a31 price tag. Wright said: \u201cSo it\u2019s a case of \u2018is it right that people can buy a company, strip it, in many respects, of cash in terms of dividends without real regard to pensions or to employees and then sell it for a pound to untried and untested people who then crash it into a cliff?\u2019\u201d He told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe are keen to find out who knew what, when. This issue over the sale and acquisition of BHS raises enormous questions.\u201d MPs on the committee as well as those on the work and pensions committee are taking evidence on BHS. Green declined to comment. Wright said: \u201cWhen you sell a business do you have any further responsibility or do you start to crash it into the cliff and then bail out just before it does crash? Those are things we want to look at on the business select committee and we also want to see whether the system is fit for purpose in making sure we can create long-term value rather than making sure that people can extract value out of businesses to the detriment of employees and to the detriment, ultimately, potentially, of the taxpayer.\u201d While Wright has yet to announce a list of witnesses that the business select committee wants to question, they are expected to be the same as those called by Frank Field, chair of the Commons work and pensions committee. BHS called in administrators in March, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk, a year after Arcadia\u2019s 15-year ownership ended. Questions are now being asked about how its \u00a3571m pension deficit will affect the Pension Protection Fund, a rescue scheme funded by contributions from other pension pots. Sports Direct tycoon and Newcastle United Mike Ashley, who has resisted calls to appear before MPs over working conditions in his own retail empire, has indicated that he could bid for BHS. Green is also thought to have considered a move to buy back the brand he once owned, while boardroom veteran and former Asda boss Allan Leighton has also been linked with a rescue bid.",

But the report says there is little difference between the top two states and between the bottom three. Victoria has gained \u201csubstantial ground\u201d on NSW with strong housing finance, population growth, and the fastest annual economic growth rate in the nation. At the other end of the scale, the Tasmanian economy has improved enough to draw equal-last with South Australia after a modest lift in momentum driven by the low Australian dollar. The Tasmanian treasurer, Peter Gutwein, told Hobart paper the Mercury that he welcomed the slight improvement but there was still \u201ca lot of work to do\u201d. Western Australia, which had the strongest-performing economy in the October 2014 report, remains second-highest on construction work but second-lowest in business investment, population growth and housing finance. Population growth in particular has taken a dive: the end of the mining boom has seen it drop to 1.27%, down more than 50% on the decade average. The end of the boom has also seen WA ranked worst performer in terms of unemployment. The unemployment rate is 5.7% in trend terms, up from a decade-average of 4.4%. However, the report notes that at least part of WA\u2019s low rank could be due to a change in the data used to measure economic growth, which is now measured just on state final demand figures. \u201cNo doubt if exports and imports were considered, Western Australia would have been among the strongest-growing economies rather than in fifth place (for economic growth),\u201d the report notes. The State of the States report, released quarterly, rates states and territories across eight key measures: economic growth; retail spending; equipment investment; unemployment; construction work; population growth; housing finance; and dwelling starts. The Australian Capital Territory was in third place, driven by a 21.1% increase in equipment investment in the past 12 months and strong annual population growth. The Northern Territory ranked fourth, despite continuing to lead the economic growth and construction work indicators, due to placing last in population growth, business investment and housing finance. Queensland, which had the lowest national ranking on construction work and second-lowest on economic growth, ranked fifth. \u201cThe end of the construction phase of the mining boom is clearly evident in Western Australia and Queensland,\u201d CommSec chief economist Craig James told AAP.",
