      "bodyText": "Share prices fell sharply on both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday as traders fretted about the impact of potential increases in interest rates on the nascent economic recovery. The FTSE 100 closed down 1.6% at 6483, and the Dow Jones index of leading shares in New York lost 225.47 points \u2013 almost 1.5% \u2013 to suffer its worst drop since June. Markets in France and Germany also declined. Investors appeared to be spooked by fears that central banks will soon start to put the brakes on the economy. In Britain, the yield on 10-year gilts, or UK government bonds, rose to a two-year high of just over 2.7%, in a challenge to Bank of England governor Mark Carney's policy of forward guidance. Higher gilt yields \u2013 the flipside of falling bond prices \u2013 increase the cost of borrowing for the government and tend to push up interest rates across the economy, which could jeopardise economic recovery. Carney and his colleagues on the Bank's monetary policy committee have pledged to keep rates at their record low of 0.5% until unemployment falls below 7%, which they do not expect to happen until late 2016. But encouraging data \u2013 including news on Thursday that retail sales grew by a stronger than expected 1.1% in July as the sunshine tempted consumers to the shops \u2013 has led many investors to bet that rates will have to go up sooner than the Bank expects and that the huge central bank bond buying programmes, known as quantitative easing, will have to be wound up, depressing the value of gilts. The Bank's director for financial stability, Andy Haldane, recently warned that by keeping rates low and buying billions of pounds of gilts, central banks had created \"the biggest bond bubble in history\", which could create havoc if it burst. After a sharp sell-off in recent days, yields on gilts are now higher than levels early last month, when Carney \u2013 who arrived at the Bank on 1 July \u2013 used his first MPC meeting to issue a statement saying recent upward moves had been \"unwarranted\". Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, said he expected the Bank to respond in the coming weeks by making a high-profile public restatement of its commitment to keep borrowing costs down: \"Mark Carney's reputation is at stake. Interest rates are higher now than they were before the MPC intervened. I think it's only a matter of time before we see some 'open-mouth operations'.\" US investors are fixated on the possibility that Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke may soon start to \"taper\" America's $85bn-a-month (\u00a355bn) bond-buying programme, choking off the supply of cheap money that has helped to fuel the economic upturn. The impact has rippled through markets around the world, in what market analysts have described as a \"taper tantrum\". News that US inflation had risen to 2%, from 1.8% a month earlier, and that new jobless claims had fallen to their lowest level since 2007, helped feed fears that the Fed could start to phase out quantitative easing as soon as next month. James Bullard, who sits on the Fed's rate-setting open market committee, admitted that he was concerned about rising yields, but not sufficiently worried for the central bank to reverse course. \"I think it is a concern, but I think the level of yields now is still quite low by historical standards. I also think that momentum in housing is stronger than any effects that are going to come from higher yields, at least for now,\" he said. On commodity markets, oil prices jumped on Thursday, amid fears that the violence in Egypt could lead to disruptions in supplies. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude hit $111, the highest level since April. Egypt is not itself a major producer of oil but it is a transit hub for oil transported through the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean pipeline.",

    "webTitle": "Retail sales data better than expected as UK economy enjoys summer bounce", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The summer bounce in the economy was branded an \"Alice in Wongaland\" recovery on Thursday after official figures showed that shoppers stocking up on food for the barbecue and sun cream during the hot weather had boosted retail sales in July. In the latest piece of evidence that the economy is enjoying an upturn,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said retail sales increased by 1.1%, after a 0.3% rise in June, as the heatwave set the tills ringing. But after a series of strong economic indicators in recent weeks, there is an intensifying debate about whether the upturn is merely a debt-fuelled mini-boom. Economist Ann Pettifor, who foretold some of the events of the credit crunch in her 2006 book, The Coming First World Debt Crisis, said that with average wages still falling in real terms, the strong data were further evidence of debt-burdened consumers funding their spending with high-interest payday loans. She said George Osborne had abandoned his plan to create a \"march of the makers\", and resorted instead to pumping up a new house price bubble with the controversial Help to Buy policy. \"I think we're creating more asset bubbles. We haven't restructured the banks; we haven't rebalanced the economy; we haven't boosted investment: what on earth do we think we're growing this recovery on? There's nothing seriously underpinning this recovery, and that's why it's Alice in Wongaland, the confidence fairy is out there.\" The ONS said spending in July was strong across a range of sectors, including food and clothing. \"Feedback from supermarkets suggested that the sunny weather boosted sales across a range of products including food, alcohol, clothing and outdoor items,\" it added. Overall sales were 3% higher than in the same month last year \u2013 the strongest annual rise since the start of 2011 \u2013 while \"predominantly food\" stores saw a strong 2.5% jump in sales in the month. The coalition is hoping that renewed consumer confidence, helped by the improving housing market, will underpin the economic recovery in the second half of this year, after GDP expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter. Chris Williamson, of data provider Markit, said: \"Summer weather helped drive a strong upturn in retail sales in July, adding to the likelihood that the economic recovery will have continued at a firm pace into the third quarter. Coming on the back of rises in prior months, this means sales in the three months to July showed the largest quarterly rise for almost 10 years.\" Retailers are breathing a sigh of relief, after a tough 12 months. Helen Dickson, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said: \"These results add to the signs we are seeing of a tentative recovery taking hold. UK retailers still face significant challenges, but the outlook is gradually improving.\" She said the strong figures were evidence that shops had been able to adapt to the hot weather and meet exceptional demand. Andy Clarke, chief executive, the UK's second-biggest supermarket, Asda, was more downbeat. Revealing that sales growth had slowed, he said: \"Let's face it, we are bumping around the bottom and I think that will continue. We still see a squeeze on disposable income. While the economy is improving it is still very tough for customers.\" Some City analysts share Pettifor's concern that with incomes still falling in real terms as prices rise more rapidly than average wages, the improvement in consumer spending is only coming through households dipping into their savings or piling up more debt. The ONS said prices were 1.8% higher than the same month last year \u2013 a slower rate of growth than the wider inflation rate, which also includes the cost of services. Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at foreign exchange firm Monex Europe, said: \"While the data will be taken as confirmation that the UK economy is gathering momentum into what is becoming an entrenched recovery, it also highlights a huge risk. This growth is the result of debt-fuelled consumer spending, underpinned by a drop in the saving ratio and higher house prices.\" But David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said a spending spree was a good start to a more sustained upturn. \"Some commentators have suggested that strong retail sales, while other areas of the economy remain weak, will lead to an unbalanced economic structure. We don't share these concerns, as although we would like to see more growth coming from investment and net trade, it is better to rely initially on domestic demand than to have no growth at all.\"",

Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A constant stream of upbeat UK economic data is fuelling hopes that unemployment will fall more quickly than previously expected, potentially causing problems for <strong>Mark Carney</strong>.</p> <p>Almost immediately after the new Bank of England governor signalled a new era for Threadneedle Street with forward guidance on interest rates, the policy appeared to be undermined.</p> <p>Markets are not playing ball and have ignored the Bank's guidance that it will not raise interest rates until the unemployment rate falls to 7% or lower. According to Bank forecasts, that would mean interest rates will be left on hold until at least the second half of 2016. But markets are betting on a hike in 2015.</p> <p>This from <strong>James Knightley</strong> of <strong>ING:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With economic data suggesting that the recovery in activity is strengthening and broadening out across the whole economy, the demand for workers should continue to increase. We look for the unemployment rate to fall below 7% in late 2014/early 2015, which implies that the first rate hike could come in 1Q15.</p> <p>Given the strengthening labour market, we suspect wage growth will gradually climb and that we will see positive real wage growth readings in the early part of next year. Such a development, together with the fact that the BoE\u2019s forward guidance wasn\u2019t universally approved of within the Bank, will only add to the sense that the BoE won\u2019t wait until 2016 <br>before tightening monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, it is early days for the policy, and the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee will no doubt want to wait and see whether markets fall in line with its guidance. If they don't, more quantitative easing might be on the cards.</p> <p><strong>Simon Wells</strong> from <strong>HSBC</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Strong data is creating a headache for the Bank of England, which is trying to convince financial markets it will <br>not raise interest rates until 2016.

Here is a snapshot of the main markets at the end of the day: FTSE 100: -1.6% at 6,483 CAC 40: -0.51% at 4,093 DAX 30: -0.73% at 8,379 IBEX: -0.6% at 8,736 At that point, I am going to close the blog. Thank you all for following, and for your comments. See you tomorrow for another day in the eurozone and global markets. The price of a barrel of Brent Crude has hit $111, its highest since April, amid growing worries that the violence in Egypt could hit supply lines in the rest of the Middle East. Egypt is not a major oil producer, but it is a transit hub for oil transported through the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean pipeline. Analysts at Commerzbank say that the canal is unlikely to be affected, but nonetheless the \"risk premium\" is likely to rise. As Michael Hewson at CMC Markets writes: Disruptions at the Suez Canal are unlikely, but markets never move on what's likely. They move on fear. The fall in US jobless claims and uptick in inflation has raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will wind down, or taper its $85 bn stimulus programme. Here is some of the reaction so far: Charles Comiskey at Bank of Nova Scotia The data continues to improve and impress the marketplace and I think the data will continue in this direction. Then the question becomes not whether they are tapering in September, but how much. Carl Riccadonna at Deutsche Bank Securities The critical component is going to be the August jobs report. If that come in at least where it was in July, then this is going to keep the Fed on track to initiate tapering at the September (policy) meeting. Both quotes via Reuters Matt Basi at CMC Markets, writing before the US jobs and inflation data was published, is a voice of calm amid the sell-off that is underway. From the CMC Markets blog: The reality of the situation is that even if the fed made a definitive announcement on the timescale for pulling back from bond purchases, any immediate market reaction would be guesswork at best \u2013 tapering does not mean an end to asset purchases. The speed and scale of any would-be tapering are the relevant factors for investors to consider, and until we have confirmation of these details everything else is just noise\u2026 And the markets continue to slide... The Dow Jones is down 215 points, its biggest fall since late June. In London the FTSE has shed 120 points. Dow Jones: -1.43% at 15,118 S&amp;P: -1.28% at 1,663 FTSE 100: -1.87% at 6,464 CAC 40: -1.09% at 4,069 DAX 30: -1.28% at 8,330 Once again, investors are worrying that the US Federal Reserve will soon begin unwinding its massive stimulus programme. New claims for unemployment benefits have fallen to a six-year low while inflation is rising (1.38) fuelling speculation that the Fed will cut back its bond-buying programme. Hello, JR taking over from Angela Monaghan. US industrial production was flat in July, as a mini surge in mining activity was offset by falling output from factories. Mining was up 2.1%, while utilities fell 2.1% - the fourth consecutive fall in a month. Manufacturing declined by 0.1% in July, way off the 0.3% increase economists polled by Reuters had expected. As the Wall Street Journal writes: Though it accounts for less than 1/5 of gross domestic product, manufacturing is an important economic bellwether because it reacts quickly to changes in the business cycle. A weak factory sector has been weighing on economic growth driven by consumer spending. The data will be pored over amid concerns of slowdown in the world's biggest economy. James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, has admitted concern over rising 10-year bond yields which hit a two-year high on Thursday: I think it is a concern, but I think the level of yields now is still quite low by historical standards. I also think that momentum in housing is stronger than any effects that are going to come from higher yields, at least for now. US markets are down: DOW JONES: -0.9% at 15,194 S&amp;P 500: -0.6% at 1,676 Meanwhile losses in Europe have accelerated: FTSE 100: -1.6% at 6,482 CAC 40: -0.8% at 4,082 DAX 30: -1% at 8,358 IBEX: -1% at 8,698 Across the Atlantic US annual inflation rose to 2% in July from 1.8% in June according to Labor Department data. It was exactly in line with economists' expectations. The Consumer Prices Index rose 0.2% on a monthly basis. Meanwhile new jobless claims fell to 320,000 last week, from 335,000 a week earlier. It was fewer than expected, and the lowest since October 2007. A combination of the two drove US borrowing costs higher as speculation mounted that the Federal Reserve will start to ease quantitative easing in September. Yields on 10-year US Treasury bonds hit 2.8% for the first time since August 2011. The dollar strengthened to a near two-week high against the euro, and a more than one-week high against the yen. The euro was down 0.1% at $1.3238, while the dollar was up 0.4% ar 98.47 yen. The FTSE 100 is down 1.2% at 6,509. The biggest fallers are house builder Persimmon which is down 6%, easyJet which is down 3.7%, TUI Travel which is 3.5% lower and Travis Perkins which is down 3.4%. Investor nerves are mounting amid US stimulus fears according to IG's Chris Beauchamp: A constant stream of upbeat UK economic data is fuelling hopes that unemployment will fall more quickly than previously expected, potentially causing problems for Mark Carney. Almost immediately after the new Bank of England governor signalled a new era for Threadneedle Street with forward guidance on interest rates, the policy appeared to be undermined. Markets are not playing ball and have ignored the Bank's guidance that it will not raise interest rates until the unemployment rate falls to 7% or lower. According to Bank forecasts, that would mean interest rates will be left on hold until at least the second half of 2016. But markets are betting on a hike in 2015. This from James Knightley of ING: With economic data suggesting that the recovery in activity is strengthening and broadening out across the whole economy, the demand for workers should continue to increase. We look for the unemployment rate to fall below 7% in late 2014/early 2015, which implies that the first rate hike could come in 1Q15. Given the strengthening labour market, we suspect wage growth will gradually climb and that we will see positive real wage growth readings in the early part of next year. Such a development, together with the fact that the BoE\u2019s forward guidance wasn\u2019t universally approved of within the Bank, will only add to the sense that the BoE won\u2019t wait until 2016 before tightening monetary policy. Of course, it is early days for the policy, and the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee will no doubt want to wait and see whether markets fall in line with its guidance. If they don't, more quantitative easing might be on the cards. Simon Wells from HSBC: Strong data is creating a headache for the Bank of England, which is trying to convince financial markets it will not raise interest rates until 2016. But the immediate reaction of markets to this morning's strong retail sales has been a further rise in short-term interest rates, which are now more than 10 basis points higher than when the MPC announced forward guidance. We think the recent rises in short-term rates are overdone. The majority of the MPC seem to think that supply can grow with demand so that economic slack persists, unemployment remains elevated and the UK sees a period of non-inflationary growth. Although we think unemployment might fall slightly faster than the MPC predicts, the MPC is in no mood to tighten and some members may start voting for more easing soon if market rates remain at current levels. Larry Elliott, the Guardian's economics editor, is not so convinced unemployment is going to fall as quickly as some economists are forecasting. Read his blog here. The 1.1% rise in monthly UK retail sales volumes was better than economists were expecting. Here is some of the reaction out so far. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, does not share Ann Pettifor's that Britain is in the midst of the wrong sort of recovery based on spending: Some commentators have suggested that strong retail sales, while other areas of the economy remain weak, will lead to an unbalanced economic structure. We don\u2019t share these concerns, as although we would like to see more growth coming from investment and net trade, it is better to rely initially on domestic demand than to have no growth at all. Scotiabank's Alan Clarke publishes a comment entitled 'UK Retail Sales Sizzler': Hands up who had a barbeque in July? During the 15 months to June 2013, the average temperature per month has been an average of 1\u00bd degrees below average. That changed during July when summer belatedly started \u2013 unleashing pent up demand for barbeque food. Predominantly food sales up 2.5% m/m. Weather aside, the rise in the trend for retail sales is very impressive, especially against a backdrop of negative real disposable income growth. This demonstrates the feel good factor that households are feeling from rising house prices - in turn it means that they are prepared to spend more than they earn. As such this is good for growth. Admittedly it is bad growth, but I'd rather have bad growth than no growth. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says the data reinforce expectations that the UK economy made a good start to the third quarter. Summer weather helped drive a strong upturn in retail sales in July, adding to the likelihood that the economic recovery will have continued at a firm pace into the third quarter. Coming on the back of rises in prior months, this means sales in the three months to July showed the largest quarterly rise for almost ten years. This pace of growth of retail sales is unlikely to persist, but a further upturn in consumer confidence, an improving labour market, rising house prices and greater confidence that interest rates will stay low for longer should all help ensure that consumer spending plays a role in helping to sustain the economic recovery in coming months. Read the full story on the retail sales data from Heather Stewart here. Following the stronger than expected UK retail sales data and Ann Pettifor's comments this morning, do you think Britain is reliant on a debt and spending fuelled recovery? Have your say in our poll here. Retail sales rose by 1.1% on a monthly basis in July, better than the 0.6% forecast by economists. On an annual basis volumes were 3% higher according to the Office for National Statistics data, again beating expectations of a 2.5% rise. It was the biggest annual rise since January 2011. The ONS said the rise in July was largely down to greater food sales, although supermarkets suggested that the sunny weather boosted sales across a range of products including food, alcohol, clothing and outdoor items. Average weekly spend on retail in July was \u00a37bn, up from \u00a36.8bn in June and \u00a36.7bn in July. For every pound spent in the retail industry in July: 42p was spent in food stores 41p in non-food stores 11p in stores selling fuel 6p in non-store retailin Some reaction to retail sales on Twitter: The major European indices are down slightly this morning following falls on Wall Street yesterday. FTSE 100: -0.4% at 6,565 CAC 40: -0.2% at 4,105 DAX 30: -0.3% at 8,409 IBEX: -0.1% at 8,782 UK economists are poised for the retail sales data out shortly, which are expected to show that a combination of rising confidence, the summer heatwave, royal baby and Andy Murray's Wimbledon succcess encouraged Britain's consumers to shop in July. At 1.30pm UK time US inflation data for July will be published, as well as the Empire State manufacturing survey for August and weekly jobless claims. They will be followed at 2.15pm by US industrial production figures for July, and the National Association of Home Builders housing market index and Philadelphia Fed index at 3pm. The UK has an \"Alice in Wongaland\" economy according to Prime Economics' Ann Pettifor, reliant on pay-day loan-fuelled shopping sprees. She made the comments before July retail sales figures from the Office for National Statistics are published at 9.30am. The data are expected to show retail sales rose 0.6% on a monthly basis, which would be better than June's 0.2% rise. That would mean retail sales were 2.5% higher in July than a year earlier, compared with 2.2% in June. Pettifor is not convinced the figures will be reason for celebration however, arguing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the trend will prove unsustainable, and writing in her blog: Britain\u2019s economy as a whole is today driven by a \u2018payday borrowing\u2019 culture encouraged by the \u2018guardians of the nation\u2019s finances\u2019 \u2013 the public authorities. This \u2018payday borrowing\u2019 culture leads consumers to pop on to the internet to borrow a couple of hundred quid \u2013 a process we are told takes no more than 15 minutes \u2013 in order to fund (at an unusustainable rate of interest) that day\u2019s consumption. This is the delusional, debt-fuelled, short-term approach that the Chancellor so decried back in 2010. It led to the gigantic crash of 2007-9. So far from moving \u201cto a new model of economic growth that is rooted in more investment, more savings and higher exports\u201d Britain is rapidly becoming an \u201cAlice in Wongaland\u201d economy. She is also less than impressed by the government's flagship Help to Buy housing scheme, joining the likes of Vince Cable and Lord King in voicing fears of another housing bubble: This intervention will inflate house prices (and indeed is already doing so), increase household borrowing, and create yet another asset price bubble. At the same time it will encourage already-indebted consumers to borrow more! Good morning all. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Overnight the Nikkei fell 2.1% to 13,753 following falls on Wall Street and after Japanese policymakers played down reports the government is considering a corporation tax cut. The World Gold Council meanwhile has published a report showing demand for the precious metal fell to a four-year low in the second quarter as investors left bullion funds and central bank buying more than halved. The fall came despite a 53% surge in demand among global consumers. Demand for gold jewellery jumped 54% in China, and 51% in India. Globally, jewellery demand was up 37% in the second quarter to 576 tonnes from 421 tonnes in the same period last year, reaching its highest level since the third quarter of 2008. But a 400-tonne outflow from gold-backed exchange-traded funds and a 93-tonne fall in central bank purchases pushed overall demand down 12% compared with a year earlier, to 856 tonnes. It was the lowest level since the second-quarter of 2009. Marcus Grubb, investment managing director at the World Gold Council comments: The second quarter continued the trend that we saw in the first, of a rebalancing in the market, as gold coming onto the market from exchange-traded funds sales met with a wave of demand for bars and coins, as well as jewellery. This surge in bar and coin investment was a common theme in key markets around the world, and has been particularly prominent in the world\u2019s biggest gold markets, India and China. Gold prices have fallen by about a fifth this year. They hit a three-year low in June of $1,180 an ounce, and are currently around $1,320 following a record high of $1,920 an ounce in September 2011.",

This is a perfect case of good politics leading to bad policy. No political party should ever have to rule out anything forever. And the GST does deserve to be examined, because the days of revenue flowing from company tax are gone. In 2006-07 company tax revenue reached a high of 5.3% of GDP; last year it was just 4.3%.

The Treasury calculates that the exemptions to the GST on things such as fresh food, education, health, financial supplies and childcare services cost the government $19.8bn in 2012-13. So should governments rush to grab this money? Well the problem is removing these exemptions would have consequences for equality. Getting rid of a number of the areas exempted \u2013 most crucially food \u2013 would hit those on lower incomes hardest. The most recent Household Expenditure Survey released by the ABS allows us to examine how households spend their money. The poorest 20% of households spend around 11% of their income on GST-exempt food. By contrast the richest 20% spend only 6.7%. So including GST on food would inherently make the tax more regressive. But if we look at education expenses we see the opposite situation: Here we find, not surprisingly, that the richest 20% spend a lot more of their income on school fees than do the poorest households. With medical expenses however, the picture is less clear: Here we find the poorest spend the most of their income on such fees, but it is worth remembering, as we noted last week, that household income is also linked to age, and thus many of those on the lowest income include retirees who actually have above average wealth. If we combine these three GST-exempted categories plus childcare expenses, we end up with a much less regressive picture: Now it remains the case that those with the lowest incomes will be hurt the most and those with the highest will be hurt the least. This is clearly the biggest stumbling block for any political party. To counter this, income tax would need to be made more progressive, and there would probably have to be an increase in welfare payments.
