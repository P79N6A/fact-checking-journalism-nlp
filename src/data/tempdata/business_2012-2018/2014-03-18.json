    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney said that a more powerful Bank of England was needed to prevent future financial crises and sought to distance himself from a \"fatally flawed\" central banking model brought in by Tony Blair's Labour government. The governor's vision for a more coherent Bank was unveiled , on the day chancellor George Osborne appointed a respected female economist as one of the Bank's deputy governors, ending four years of an all-male interest-rate-setting committee. The appointment of Nemat Shafik, a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund and former senior civil servant, was one of three announced. Ben Broadbent, already on the monetary policy committee, will take over as a deputy governor from Charlie Bean when he retires this summer. City grandee Anthony Habgood becomes chairman of court at Threadneedle Street, the equivalent of heading the Bank of England's board. Carney, who moved to the Bank from the Bank of Canada last summer, set out his vision for a organisation with many responsibilities \"but a single timeless mission\" in a speech in London. He was critical of attempts under the former chancellor Gordon Brown to focus Bank policy on an inflation target and attacked a consensus over the past two decades that central bankers' primary goal should be price stability. \"This focus initially made sense since one of the greatest challenges for macroeconomic policy in the late 1970s and 1980s was the fight against inflation,\" he said. \"However, with time, a healthy focus became a dangerous distraction.\" He described the move by Brown in 1997 to give the Bank independence to set interest rates focusing on an inflation target as a \"deconstruction of the old model of central banking\". \"In my view, while there were enormous innovations of enduring value during this period, the reductionist vision of a central bank's role that was adopted around the world was fatally flawed,\" Carney said in his Mais Lecture at the Cass Business School in London. Referring to the \"fight against inflation\", he said: \"With time and increased confidence, policymakers would win that war only to lose the peace.\" Talking about the Bank's response to the crash, he said if it \"knew then what we know now\" and had had the powers it now has, the UK might have moved \"towards Canadian outcomes\" and avoided the stagnation at the tail end of the crisis. Egyptian-born Shafik, who is also a British and US national, will take up a new role at the Bank \u2013 deputy governor responsible for markets and banking. This means Carney has four deputies. She arrives as the Bank fights to shore up its credibility during a worldwide investigation into the alleged rigging of foreign exchange markets. Carney highlighted \"serious issues\" raised by such scandals. \"Changes must be made to both the hard and soft infrastructure of core markets to ensure they are fair, effective and efficient,\" he added. His plans for sweeping changes follow a review by management consultants at McKinsey and Carney's speech was characterised by phrases such as \"synergies and complementarities\" and \"a single timeless mission\". He described the financial crisis as a \"powerful reminder\" that price stability alone was not enough to guarantee wider macroeconomic stability. Warnings about such risks were not followed up with any action, he added. He insisted lessons had been learned and \"enormous new powers\" promised to the Bank were now being fulfilled with the creation of new committees and watchdogs policing banks and financial markets. As part of reforms seeking to counter criticisms of the Bank's sprawling and opaque structure, Carney announced the creation of an oversight unit modelled on the independent evaluation office of the IMF. Habgood, who is chairman of Costa Coffee owner Whitbread, takes over as chair of the Bank's court of directors from David Lees, who leaves at the end of June. As the new deputy governor for monetary policy, Broadbent will be responsible for the Bank's analysis of the UK and international economies that feeds into interest rate decisions. He takes on the post at a turning point in the cycle for borrowing costs. After five years at a record low of 0.5%, interest rates are expected to start rising again in 2015, albeit gradually, as the economic recovery gathers steam. Carney said: \"As the MPC has signalled, a low for long interest rate environment will likely be with us for some time.\" Andrew Tyrie, chairman of parliament's Treasury committee, said the reforms appeared to be \"an important step in the right direction\". However, the Conservative MP said the committee would want to examine the process behind Shafik's appointment. On Habgood's role, Tyrie said: \"Stringent self-examination has not been a strong point of formal Bank governance. Further reform, both cultural and structural, may be needed.\"",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England have issued separate warnings on the eve of the budget that difficult decisions lie ahead if Britain is to secure its objective of a resilient economy. In a budget expected to be replete with pre-election messages tested by the Conservative election strategist Lynton Crosby, George Osborne will claim he is presenting a budget for economic security. The chancellor is expected to point out that he is still only halfway through the economic retrenchment programme started in 2010 \u2013 and, in an eye-catching distraction, will announce plans to replace the existing round gold \u00a31 coin with a 12-sided bi-metallic design. There was also a growing suspicion Osborne had managed to hold back one large tax cut to unveil during his speech. In a bid to set the broad political tone for the budget, the penultimate financial statement before next year's general election, a Treasury source said: \"As a country we have held our nerve; the plan is working. But the job is far from done. Britain is still borrowing too much.\" The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said it \"did not take a genius\" to see that a long period of low interest rates created similar risks to those that led to Britain's deepest post-war recessions and said the Bank had to focus on more than keeping inflation low, a goal he said had become a \"dangerous distraction\". He said the old model \"failed to recognise that financial stability is as important an objective of macroeconomic policy as price stability, and it downplayed the inter-relationships between the two\". Carney warned that the pursuit of price stability could lead to the gradual build-up of financial vulnerability through its effect on the willingness to take risks. Gordon Brown gave the Bank control over interest rates when he became chancellor in 1997 but stripped it of much of its power to supervise the City by simultaneously setting up the Financial Services Authority. By contrast, Osborne has given the Bank a range of new powers, including strategic oversight of the City and supervision of individual banks \u2013 a decision praised by Carney on Tuesday night. As for Osborne, pre-budget speculation has focused on whether he will put his slim spare resources on the low paid by raising personal tax allowances or instead help those better off by raising the 40p tax threshold. Osborne has been under effective pressure from the Liberal Democrats to raise the personal allowance to \u00a310,500 from April 2015, a \u00a31.4bn-a-year move that will take another 200,000 out of paying income tax, adding to the 5m earners who do not pay tax.

Osborne is expecting the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to revise its 2014 growth figures from 2.4% to around 2.7%, but growth is expected to slow in the two years thereafter, giving Labour a chance to claim the recovery is not embedded. Independent forecasters have pointed to the government achieving a modest surplus of \u00a35bn by 2019 \u2013 \u00a33bn higher than the OBR's December forecast. Labour countered that Osborne wanted to take credit for increasing the personal allowance, but hoped voters would forget his 24 Tory tax rises including the VAT hike. Ahead of the big decisions the Treasury provided a populist distraction, revealing that it will introduce a new \u00a31 coin, being billed as an anti-euro security measure. The proposed \u00a31 coin design is the same shape as the old 12-sided three pence piece or \"threepenny bit\", a coin that can be traced back in England to the 16th century and the reign of King Edward VI, but was finally phased out with decimalisation in 1971.

In a ministerial vote of confidence for the scheme, the budget will announce successful local councils will be entitled to bid to tackle an extra 40,000 families in 2014-15, a year earlier than previously planned. In a boost for the Treasury, the Social Market Foundation has produced evidence showing working households in the middle 20% \u2013 the 40th-60th percentile \u2013 have done well from the brink of the down turn in 2007-08 to 2011-12.

Ronny Gottschlich, Lidl's UK boss, said the recession had helped it win the hearts of a group of middle class shoppers it calls the \"Maidstone mums\", who would have considered shopping in Lidl social suicide during the years of plenty. \"The recession shone a spotlight on us as a supermarket that offers high quality products at low prices,\" he said. \"This low-pricing strategy that continues to draw new middle class -\u2013the Maidstone mums \u2013 customers into our stores for the first time.\" The so-called \"hard discounters\" were recession darlings, but despite signs of a recovery, the discounters' love affair with British shoppers shows no sign of ending. The pair now account for 75p out of every \u00a310 spent on food and are bigger than the Co-op, the country's fifth largest supermarket. With 70 more shops planned to open their doors this year their influence is likely to grow. During the financial crisis consumer trend watchers talked of the \"Aldi effect\", calling its customers the \"Aldi-rati\" as \u00a34.99 Canadian lobsters from Lidl and \u00a37.99 bottles of Chateauneuf-du-Pape from Aldi were guzzled at dinner parties around the country. At that time the discounters were viewed as places to pick up a few extras but as hard-up Britons continue to cut back spending on food they are now seen as a destination for a full weekly shop. \"Our growth is due to more and more shoppers choosing Aldi for their main weekly shop,\" said Matthew Barnes and Roman Heini, Aldi's joint group managing directors in a statement. \"People want to, rather than need to, shop at Aldi.\" Aldi is also going after Sainsbury's well-heeled clientele with recent openings in affluent places such as Knutsford and Bishop's Stortford. \"The demographic profile of the Aldi customer has expanded, as positive word of mouth spreads,\" added the directors, who said a drive to stock more British products had also helped convert shoppers. With Lidl closing in on 600 stores in the UK, Gottschlich says it is here to stay with a long-term plan for a 1,500-strong chain. Aldi, with more than 500 outlets, also has ambitious growth plans, with 50 openings planned this year including its first on the Isle of Wight, in Cowes. The privately owned retailers are famously publicity shy but Lidl says it now plans to be more open. \"We feel now that the time is right to communicate more openly about our successes and growth plans,\" says Gottschlich. But it is business as usual for Aldi, which declined to confirm how many UK stores it had and does not even list its shops in the phone book.",

We all have to own it \u2026 and we\u2019re using this opportunity to change much more about our business.\u201d</p> <p>GM\u2019s woes mounted Monday as it disclosed three recalls that together encompass nearly 1.5 vehicles, the latest in a series that the company said would cost it $300m in the first quarter.</p> <p>The company said the trio of recalls had come as \u201ca result of Mary Barra\u2019s request for a comprehensive internal safety review\u201d following a separate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/12/general-motors-loaner-cars-500-owners-recalled-compact-cars\">recall last week</a> of another 1.6 million cars due to ignition switch issues.</p> <p>The company\u2019s handling of the original ignition-switch recall is now the subject of lawsuits and federal investigations. According to internal documents, GM knew of a switch problem in some of its vehicles as early as 2001 but only recalled the cars last month. The House energy and commerce committee said last week that it would launch an inquiry into the slow recall.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s recalls relate to issues with seat-mounted side airbags in 1.18 million full-size crossover SUVs including 2009-2013 Chevrolet Traverse, 2008-2013 Buick Enclave, 2008-2013 GMC Acadia and 2008-2010 Saturn Outlook.</p> <p>GM says the danger happens if drivers ignore the airbag warning light on their instrument panel. If drivers do not address the issue, it can lead to a wiring failure and \u201cnon-deployment of the side impact restraints\u201d.</p> <p>The company also issued a recall of 63,900 2013 and 2014 Cadillac XTS full-size sedans over a plug in the brake system that can come loose, allowing corrosion and increasing the likelihood of overheating and an engine-compartment fire.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/12/general-motors-loaner-cars-500-owners-recalled-compact-cars\">The third recall</a> relates to 303,000 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans in which the material covering the passenger-side air bag does not meet federal standards. The company said the risk only applied to passengers who are not wearing safety belts.</p> <p>Michelle Krebs, an independent auto analyst, said the latest recalls would further damage GM\u2019s brand just as the company had appeared to be turning a corner. Barra\u2019s appointment in January was heralded as a pivotal moment for the company. She is the first woman to head a major car company and the first auto-executive to run the company since it emerged from bankruptcy in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cI think they are trying to send the message that this is the new GM, there will be no delays and they will tackle their issues,\u201d said Krebs. \u201cIt is a hit on their reputation, though. GM was seen as having quality issues, clearly they have improved but this is a blow.\u201d</p>",

The company said the trio of recalls had come as \u201ca result of Mary Barra\u2019s request for a comprehensive internal safety review\u201d following a separate recall last week of another 1.6 million cars due to ignition switch issues. The company\u2019s handling of the original ignition-switch recall is now the subject of lawsuits and federal investigations. According to internal documents, GM knew of a switch problem in some of its vehicles as early as 2001 but only recalled the cars last month. The House energy and commerce committee said last week that it would launch an inquiry into the slow recall. Monday\u2019s recalls relate to issues with seat-mounted side airbags in 1.18 million full-size crossover SUVs including 2009-2013 Chevrolet Traverse, 2008-2013 Buick Enclave, 2008-2013 GMC Acadia and 2008-2010 Saturn Outlook. GM says the danger happens if drivers ignore the airbag warning light on their instrument panel. If drivers do not address the issue, it can lead to a wiring failure and \u201cnon-deployment of the side impact restraints\u201d. The company also issued a recall of 63,900 2013 and 2014 Cadillac XTS full-size sedans over a plug in the brake system that can come loose, allowing corrosion and increasing the likelihood of overheating and an engine-compartment fire. The third recall relates to 303,000 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans in which the material covering the passenger-side air bag does not meet federal standards. The company said the risk only applied to passengers who are not wearing safety belts. Michelle Krebs, an independent auto analyst, said the latest recalls would further damage GM\u2019s brand just as the company had appeared to be turning a corner. Barra\u2019s appointment in January was heralded as a pivotal moment for the company. She is the first woman to head a major car company and the first auto-executive to run the company since it emerged from bankruptcy in 2009. \u201cI think they are trying to send the message that this is the new GM, there will be no delays and they will tackle their issues,\u201d said Krebs. \u201cIt is a hit on their reputation, though. GM was seen as having quality issues, clearly they have improved but this is a blow.\u201d",

He also announced that \u20ac500m will be distributed to the poorest members of Greek society -- which we understand has not pleased its Troika of lenders.</p> <h2>Our correspondent Helena Smith was there, and has the story:</h2> <p>Samaras told reporters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe long negotiations with the troika have been successfully concluded. When others doubted the economy\u2019s achievements or even tried to thwart them, this government, united, went on [with the business] of seriously pursuing its mission, to get the country out of the crisis,\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Listing what he described as the 21-month-old governments achievements to date \u2013 preventing Greece\u2019s exit from the euro zone, ending the country\u2019s prolonged recession and attaining a primary budget surplus \u201cearlier than the [financial assistance programme] foresaw\u201d \u2013 Samaras said the time had come when austerity-hit Greeks could finally take back what they had lost.</p> <p>Aided by the primary surplus (to be formally announced by the Greek statistics agency in April) he pledged that his administration would now act on its promise to shore up those most affected by the crisis.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWith great satisfaction I can announce that more than 500 million euro will immediately be given to over a million Greeks on the basis of income and property criteria. That is to say to the poorest, to those who have suffered the most, to those who are most in need. </p> <p>And of course to those in uniform whose monthly salary is less than 1,500 euro. Just as we had promised.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But that may not be easy. As is so often the case in a country that while making terrific fiscal progress has yet to deal with the cause of its problems \u2013 its monumental debt \u2013 black clouds are on the horizon.</p> <p>The Troika is not the least bit happy with the idea of the surplus being handed out and has made clear that it wants the extra monies to be used for growth and development.

The influential Treasury Committee has announced that it will hold \u201cpre-appointment hearings\u201d with the Bank of England\u2019s new Chairman of Court, Anthony Habgood, as well as with its new Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy, Dr Ben Broadbent and its new Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking, Dr Nemat Shafik. They won\u2019t be US-style confirmation hearings (these decisions are now official), but the Committee can still put the trio through their paces. The Chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie MP, seems particularly keen to quiz the new (female) deputy governor for markets and banking, \u2018Minouche\u2019 Shafik. Tyrie said: \u201cThis is part of a major structural reorganisation at the Bank. The Committee will want to hear Dr Carney\u2019s reasons for the creation of this new position and will also examine the process by which Dr Shafik was appointed. \u201cIn addition, we will be particularly interested to hear Dr Shafik\u2019s thoughts on what her role will entail.\u201d Tyrie also warned that Habgood needs to get to grips with the Bank\u2019s antiquated ways, and improve its governance. \u201cStringent self-examination has not been a strong point of formal Bank governance. Further reform, both cultural and structural, may be needed. The Crimea crisis has, though, scuppered German retailer Metro\u2019s plan to float its Russian wholesale business on the stock market. Metro had hopes to raise at least \u20ac1bn by selling a quarter of Metro Cash &amp; Carry Russia, but confirmed today that the plan is on hold. In a statement, Metro said that \u201cin light of the recent political developments\u201d, market conditions don\u2019t make an IPO viable right now. More on Bloomberg. In the financial markets, the FTSE 100 is up around 0.6% as trading grinds towards a close. Having been in the red this morning, shares were pushed higher after Russian president Vladimir Putin addressed the federal assembly in Moscow. Although Putin announced Russia is annexing Crimea, attacked Western critics and lambasted the new Ukrainian government, there was some relief that he did not go further. Amid the bluster and rebuttals, Putin did state that \u201cWe do not want a partition of Ukraine. We do not need this.\u201d Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says this was enough to spark the \u2018Putin Rally\u2019, despite Russia\u2019s military muscle: Early morning trading was hesitant as investors took a breather from yesterdays\u2019 rally. This all changed after Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his widely-watched speech announced that Russia \u201crespects the rest of the territorial integrity of Ukraine\u201d. On the face of it this is good news for international trade out of Ukraine including the export of energy and agricultural commodities. The thousands of Russian troops on the Eastern Ukrainian border do leave room for scepticism over the Russian President\u2019s comments. Here\u2019s how Associated Press is reporting today\u2019s breakthrough in Athens: Greece concluded its tortuous negotiations with its international debt inspectors Tuesday, reaching a deal that will allow the release of a long-delayed rescue loan installment. The deal does not contain any new austerity measures, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras insisted. In fact, some \u20ac500m ($695 million) will be distributed to help more than 1 million needy Greeks. \u201cToday a long period of tribulations has ended, and a new beginning is being made,\u201d Samaras said. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said the text of the agreement was being written up. Greece has depended on its bailout from other European countries and the International Monetary Fund since mid-2010. Payment of the rescue loans depend on the country meeting criteria in spending cuts, tax increases and reforms, and Greece\u2018s progress in meeting the targets is reviewed regularly by the debt inspectors, collectively known as the \u2018troika\u2019. Greece began this latest round of negotiations in September with officials from the IMF, European Central Bank and European Commission. Talks had snagged on several issues, including public sector firings and market reforms. \u201cThese were seven very, very difficult months,\u201d Stournaras said. Apart from the \u20ac500m that would be distributed to Greece\u2018s poorest, Samaras said an additional \u20ac1bn ($1.39 billion) would go toward paying off the state\u2019s internal debts for goods and services received from the Greek private sector. That will raise to \u20ac2.8bn the amount it will pay off in internal debts in 2014. Here\u2019s another sign that investors see Greek debt as less risky -- the yield on its short-term debt (repayable after six months), has been dropping steadily this year. Bond trader Gus Baratta tweets a chart: Those anti-austerity protests in Athens are continuing, flags up university lecturer Spyros Gkelis: Greece\u2019s bailout negotiations may be over, but protests over its austerity programme continued today. One demonstration took place outside Athens city hall, led by school caretakers; hundreds are being laid off via the public spending cutbacks. A second demo involved patients from a care home for people with chronic or incurable diseases, which is scheduled to close soon. Several patients from the foundation blocked the entrance to prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s office, to protest against cuts to state subsidies. As flagged up earlier, Greece\u2019s finance minister said this latest round of negotiations with the Troika were the worst since the Greek debt crisis began: Yannis Stournaras told reporters: \u201cThis review was the toughest we\u2019ve had so far....A difficult negotiation is over.\u201d Greek government debt jumped in value as prime minister Antonis Samaras announced that a deal had been reached with its lenders. This has pushed down the interest rate, or yield, on its 10-year bonds to around 6.8%, from over 7% last night. At those levels, traders appear confident that the risk of default, or debt restructuring, has receded. After seven months of gruelling negotiations in Greece, prime minister Antonis Samaras has announced that the debt-stricken country has finally struck a deal with its troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. After marathon talks that in recent weeks have rarely ended before dawn, Greece\u2019s fragile two-party coalition has clinched the deal that will allow its triumvirate of lenders to release \u20ac10.1bn euro in aid \u2013 much of it outstanding since September. The Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras announced the agreement as he visited the finance ministry where it was formally signed. He also announced that \u20ac500m will be distributed to the poorest members of Greek society -- which we understand has not pleased its Troika of lenders. Our correspondent Helena Smith was there, and has the story: Samaras told reporters: \u201cThe long negotiations with the troika have been successfully concluded. When others doubted the economy\u2019s achievements or even tried to thwart them, this government, united, went on [with the business] of seriously pursuing its mission, to get the country out of the crisis,\u201d Listing what he described as the 21-month-old governments achievements to date \u2013 preventing Greece\u2019s exit from the euro zone, ending the country\u2019s prolonged recession and attaining a primary budget surplus \u201cearlier than the [financial assistance programme] foresaw\u201d \u2013 Samaras said the time had come when austerity-hit Greeks could finally take back what they had lost. Aided by the primary surplus (to be formally announced by the Greek statistics agency in April) he pledged that his administration would now act on its promise to shore up those most affected by the crisis. \u201cWith great satisfaction I can announce that more than 500 million euro will immediately be given to over a million Greeks on the basis of income and property criteria. That is to say to the poorest, to those who have suffered the most, to those who are most in need. And of course to those in uniform whose monthly salary is less than 1,500 euro. Just as we had promised.\u201d But that may not be easy. As is so often the case in a country that while making terrific fiscal progress has yet to deal with the cause of its problems \u2013 its monumental debt \u2013 black clouds are on the horizon. The Troika is not the least bit happy with the idea of the surplus being handed out and has made clear that it wants the extra monies to be used for growth and development. Ditto with the government\u2019s plans to return the country to international markets before euro elections in May. Parliament also has to endorse the measures Athens has now signed up. The policies are expected to be included in a one-size-all omnibus bill to be put to the House in the coming days. MPs are already digging in their heels. \u201cWe can expect a little bit of Greek drama in the next week,\u201d said veteran commentator Giorgos Kyrtsos. A quick summary of the key points so far: Dr Nemat Shafik of the International Monetary Fund has been appointed as a new deputy governor of the Bank of England, in a broad shake-up of Britain\u2019s central bank. Shafik will become the Bank of England\u2019s first female deputy governor since 2008, and will also break the all-male dominance of the Monetary Policy Committee. She says she will help to \u201creform financial markets for the post-crisis world\u201d. Shafik, aged 51, was once the youngest ever vice-president of the World Bank, and a former permanent secretary at the Department for International Development. She\u2019s been a deputy managing director at the IMF since 2011. Her appointment has been welcomed by former MPC member Adam Posen. In other changes, Ben Broadbent is also promoted to deputy governor while Andy Haldane becomes chief economist. Spencer Dale and Paul Fisher are leaving the MPC. Analysts say the changes show Mark Carney is serious about reshaping the Bank. Further changes are expected tonight,. Elsewhere: The German Constitutional Court has confirmed an initial ruling that Europe\u2019s bailout fund, the ESM, is legal. Sainsbury\u2019s has become the latest UK supermarket to post falling sales, ending a track record dating back nine years. Coverage starts here. Back in the UK, Barclays has provoked further criticism of its pay policies by handing almost \u00a332m of shares to its top managers (full story here). The shares come from bonuses awarded in previous years, which have now \u2018vested\u2019. The Robin Hood Tax campaign, which lobbies for a transaction tax, said the payouts show we live in a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d Britain. Spokesman David Hillman said: \u201cIt turns the stomach that in a year when profits plunged and scandals raged Barclays\u2019 top brass are receiving lottery-sized handouts regardless. This blows Barclays\u2019 claim to be a reformed institution out of the water.\u201d News in Greece: the Athens government and its Troika of lenders have reached an agreement to unlock the country\u2019s next tranche of bailout loans. The breakthrough comes after months of on-off talks, as the two sides argued over whether Athens was meeting the terms of the deal. We\u2019ll have the full story shortly - in the meantime, finance minister Yannis Stournaras told reporters that the talks had been gruelling, admitting: \u201dThis review was the toughest we\u2019ve had so far.\u201d While prime minister Antonis Samaras has given some details about fresh aid for the poorest Greeks. More to follow.... Another interesting point about Nemat Shafik\u2019s appointment -- her new role as deputy governor for markets and banking includes overseeing the unwinding of the Bank\u2019s huge bond-buying programme. The bank says she will \u201clead the design and execution of an eventual exit from quantitative easing by the MPC.\u201d That\u2019s a crucial job - the Bank currently holds \u00a3375bn of government debt, bought to stimulate the economy after rates were cut to their current record low. The BBC\u2019s Robert Peston says this will be a new responsibility for Shafik: And although she is a very high powered person, as deputy managing director of the IMF since April 2011 and prior to that permanent secretary at the Department for International Development, the cut and thrust of markets will be new to her. To be fair, though, it\u2019s hard to think of a central banker who does have first-hand experience of unwinding unconventional monetary policy of this scale. Governor Mark Carney is due to announce further changes tonight, shaking up less senior ranks of the BoE. Eight months after taking office, the Canadian central banker is now making his mark on Threadneedle Street. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, says: \u201cThis shows the extent to which Mark Carney is reshaping the bank. He\u2019s serious about making reform, not only to the structure of the Bank ... but also in terms of its culture.\u201d Here\u2019s my colleague Katie Allen on today\u2019s changes at the Bank of England: Chancellor George Osborne has appointed a respected female economist as a Bank of England deputy governor, ending four years of an all-male interest-rate setting committee. The appointment of Nemat Shafik, a deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was one of three senior officials announced on Tuesday as part of a radical shakeup at the Bank under governor Mark Carney. Ben Broadbent, already on the monetary policy committee, will take over as a deputy governor from Charlie Bean when he retires this summer. City grandee Anthony Habgood becomes chairman of court at Threadneedle Street, managing the Bank\u2019s affairs other than monetary policy. The appointment of Egyptian-born Shafik, who is also a British and US national, follows growing criticism of Osborne\u2019s failure to appoint a woman to the monetary policy committee. The nine-member committee, which meets monthly to set interest rates under the chairmanship of Carney, has been without a female member since Kate Barker left in May 2010. More here: Bank of England makes Nemak Shafik and Ben Broadbent deputy governors Another former MPC member, Adam Posen, reckons appointing Minouche Shafik as a deputy governor of the Bank of England is a wise move: Conspiracy theory watch: To recap, this morning\u2019s changes mean Paul Fisher and Spencer Dale will both leave the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee later this year. What will this mean for interest rates? Analysts at BNP Paribas point out that MPC is losing a dove (Fisher) and a hawk (Dale, who voted to raise rates in 2011). However, they don\u2019t have much idea on Shafik\u2019s views, while Haldane\u2019s independent streak means he also hard to predict. PWC\u2019s chief economist Andrew Sentance, a former MPC member, sums up the changes: The TUC\u2019s senior economist, Duncan Weldon, also points to Paul Fisher\u2019s exit from the MPC: The Telegraph\u2019s Jeremy Warner points to the rise of the ex-Goldman Sachs operative Ben Broadbent: The big loser in today\u2019s changes appears to be Paul Fisher -- the Bank\u2019s executive director for markets -- who is leaving the monetary policy committee Fisher faced a grilling from MPs last week over suggestions that the BoE failed to investigate concerns that the foreign exchange market had been rigged. The Bank of England shake-up continues. Andy Haldane, the highly regarded executive director for financial stability, has been promoted to chief economist -- in something of a job swap with incumbent Spencer Dale. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde says the Fund will miss Nemat Shafik -- describing her as \u201ca dear colleague and, I am proud to say, a dear friend as well\u201d. \u201cI know I speak for all colleagues at the Fund when I say that Minouche will be missed. The fact that she is leaving us to take up such an important post is testimony to her broad command of policy issues, her superb leadership and communications skills, and her global reputation.\u201d Nemat Shafik will arrive at the Bank of England in August to take up her deputy govenor duties with an impressive track record. Egyptian-born Shafik, who is also a British and US national, holds a degree in economics and politics from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, an MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics, and a DPhil in Economics from St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford University. Having been the youngest ever Vice President at the World Bank at just 36, she then joined Britain\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) and rose to become the department\u2019s most senior civil servant ( Permanent Secretary) At DFID she oversaw all Britain\u2019s overseas development work, including bilateral aid programmes in over 100 countries. She then joined the International Monetary Fund in April 2011 as a Deputy Managing Director, and oversees work on countries in Europe and the Middle East. She was also responsible for the IMF\u2019s $1 billion administrative budget, human resources for its 3,000 staff and oversees the IMF\u2019s training and technical assistance for policy makers around the world. She regularly chairs the Board of the IMF and represents it across the globe. Shafik is often known by her nickname Minouche, as the Guardian reported last year, adding: Anyone who describes herself as a world citizen, and who was named \u201cwoman of the year\u201d at the Global Leadership and Global Diversity awards, and who has had a distinguished career in global economic development, is clearly well-placed to think about the way global governments work together on complex, long-term issues. Nemat Shafik says she will help \u201creform financial markets for the post-crisis world\u201d when she joins the Bank of England, on 1 August. I am excited to be joining the Bank at such a critical time of institutional change, and I look forward to fulfilling this challenging new role on the Bank\u2019s senior leadership team, as we re-shape the Bank\u2019s balance sheet, review and strengthen the Bank\u2019s operational roles, and, through continued international engagement, reform financial markets for the post-crisis world. Her fellow new deputy governor, Dr Ben Broadbent, says he\u2019s \u201chonoured\u201d to keep serving the British public (he\u2019s been on the MPC since 2011). I have found my role as an external MPC member immensely rewarding, and I look forward to working with Mark Carney, my future fellow MPC and FPC members, and all Bank staff in this new capacity, as we work together to maintain monetary and financial stability.\u201d The full statement is online here. The chancellor, George Osborne, has broken away from putting the finishing touches to tomorrow\u2019s budget to announce the changes at the Bank of England: The appointment of Nemat Shafik goes some way, finally, to addressing the gender imbalance at the top of the Bank of England. She becomes the first woman deputy governor since Rachel Lomax, who stepped down in 2008. She will also end the male domination of the monetary policy committee, which dates back to 2010 when Kate Barker left the MPC at the end of May 2010. The UK Treasury has just announced that Dr Nemat Shafik, a deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, will join the Bank of England as a deputy governor. Shafik, who was the youngest ever Vice President at the World Bank (at just 36!), will take responsibility for markets and banking -- in response to allegations that foreign exchange markets have been rigged. She will join the Monetary Policy Committee (which sets interest rates), taking Paul Fisher\u2019s chair, and also the Financial Policy Committee (responsible for financial stability). Ben Broadbent, the former Goldman Sachs man on the MPC, has also been promoted to deputy governor in charge of monetary policy. And in another shake-up at Britain\u2019s central bank, the Bank of England Court is getting a new chair -- City grandee Antony Hapgood. The changes are part of Mark Carney\u2019s efforts to reform the Bank of England. In a statement, the governor said Shafik, Broadbent and Hapgood will all drive the Bank forwards: With a diverse combination of skills and experience, these appointments result in a well-rounded senior management team at the Bank \u2013 one that will set the direction for an ambitious agenda of transformation for the institution and enable it to meet the challenges and opportunities it faces in maintaining monetary and financial stability.\u201d More to follow.... Breaking news in Germany -- the country\u2019s constitutional court has ruled that the main European bailout fund is legal, upholding its preliminary ruling from 2012. The judges in Karlsruhe have concluded that the \u20ac700bn fund, the European Stability Mechanism, does not violate Germany\u2019s parliament\u2019s control of its budget. Chief judge, Andreas Vosskuhle, declared that: Despite the liabilities assumed, the budgetary autonomy of the German Bundestag is sufficiently safeguarded. This confirms the judge\u2019s original view -- which was delivered when the eurozone crisis was raging. But the court has also capped Germany\u2019s contributions at \u20ac190bn -- any increased will need parliamentary approval. 18-Mar-2014 09:18 - CONSTITUTIONAL COURT REITERATES GERMANY\u2019S LIABILITY TO ESM MUST BE LIMITED TO 190 BLN EUROS, ANY MORE NEEDS PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL 18-Mar-2014 09:19 - GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ALSO CONFIRMS LEGALITY OF FISCAL PACT Sainsbury\u2019s will be buffeted by discounters and price wars in 2014, says Richard Hunter of Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers: The march of the discount supermarkets continues to threaten prospects, whilst the strategic measures being taken by Sainsbury\u2019s quoted rivals will exert further pressure. In addition, the group\u2019s accompanying comments reflect caution over the medium term outlook, even after this difficult quarter. More positively, the company is enjoying some success in the increasingly important areas of convenience stores and online, whilst general merchandising is showing further progress and market share has been maintained. Simon Nixon, founder of price-comparison site Moneysupermarket.com, has an extra \u00a3129.5m to spend after cashing in a chunk of shares this morning. Nixon cut his stake in the financial services price comparison site to 16.6% after selling 70m shares - or around 12% of its share base. He had already raised \u00a3100m when the firm floated in 2007, and raised another \u00a3200m from a share sales last summer. Nixon famously founded the financial services price comparison site after dropping out of a \u201cboring\u201d accountancy course. He can now afford to do something rather more exciting... Shares in online retailer ASOS have tumbled almost 20% this morning after missing sales forecasts and announced new investment plans which will take a chunk out of its profit margins. The fast-growing firm told shareholders this morning that sales rose by 26% in January and February -- less than analysts had expected (some had expected a 35% rise) It is also throwing millions of pounds more at its warehousing and IT operations, hiking its capital expenditure budget from \u00a355m to \u00a368m this year. ASOS\u2019s ability to react quickly to the latest fashion trends have made it a hit with Generation Y and Millennials (young people, your honour) -- it expects to shift \u00a31bn of goods this year. This morning\u2019s tumble has wiped around \u00a31bn off ASOS\u2019s value, as analysts fear that its spectacular growth rates could be faltering. CEO Nick Robertson insists that spending more money on infrastructure makes sense -- it will push ASOS\u2019s sales capacity to \u00a32.5bn per annum, over \u00a31bn higher than previous guidance. But the City doesn\u2019t like the impact on profit margins -- down to 6.5%, from the 7% expected. Justin King and his successor Mike Coupe are holding a press call with financial reporters now: King reiterated that Sainsbury held its market share and outperformed its peers, despite delivering \u201cdeclining sales\u201d. Journalists are asking whether the firm will retaliate to the price war launched by Morrison\u2019s last week: My colleague Sean Farrell is tweeting the highlights: Sainsbury\u2019s is losing out to upmarket rivals in the battle for online shoppers, reckons veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb reckons: After last Thursday\u2019s bombshell from Morrison\u2019s, today\u2019s Sainsbury\u2019s Q4 trading update (for the 10 weeks ending 15th March) will get plenty of attention and although a 3.1% LFL sales decline was expected (given the tough \u201chorsemeat\u201d comp of +3.6% LFL a year ago), there is not much here for the normally ebullient Justin King to shout about. And growth of only 6% in Online Grocery sales certainly isn\u2019t much to shout about, with Waitrose and Ocado evidently stealing Sainsbury\u2019s customers, while Sainsbury overhaul their customer website and hold back marketing. J Sainsbury shares have fallen by 0.7% in early trading, down 2.2p to 309.2p. It\u2019s the end of an era, say retail analysts, as they digest Sainsbury\u2019s failure to grow sales in the last quarter. Andrew Stevens of Verdict Retail agrees that last year\u2019s strong performance was hard to match, tweeting: Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme joked that Justin King \u2018left it too late\u2019 by tendering his resignation in January -- had he quit last year, he\u2019d have the rare honour of having grown sales throughout his tenure. King replied that falling sales are obviously disappointing, but argued that Sainsbury\u2019s did retain market share and has been the best-performing major player since the financial crisis began (rival Morrison\u2019s issued a shocker of a profits warning last week) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and the business world. We start with the news that supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s proud claim to have grown sales in every financial quarter since 2005 has been broken. J Sainsbury has just reported that like-for-like sales slid slid by 3.1% (or a chunkier 3.8% if you include fuel sales) in the 10 weeks to March 15, the first fall in 36 consecutive quarters. That\u2019s a larger decline than expected, confirming that Britain\u2019s grocers are suffering as consumers feel the pinch and budget chains such as Aldi and Lidl eat their lunch. It also adds a small scratch to CEO Justin King\u2019s impressive record at Sainsbury\u2019s, as he prepared to leave the company this summer. A year ago, Sainsbury\u2019s grew its sales by 3.6%, partly because it benefitted from the public alarm as horsemeat started showing up in some rivals\u2019 products. King also blamed other one-off factors (including the weather, the first refuge of the struggling retailer). He told shareholders: The market is now growing at its slowest rate since 2005, with falling food inflation in particular benefiting customers. The later timing of Easter and Mother\u2019s Day, which fall in quarter one of our new financial year, and unseasonable weather have also contributed to lower market growth year-on-year. And a day ahead of the Budget, King warned that the UK remained a tough place to operate: Although some economic indicators are showing an improvement in the health of the economy, we expect the outlook for customers to continue to be challenging for the coming year. Sainsbury\u2019s will hold a press conference shortly. I\u2019ll be tracking the reaction to the figures, and all the other key developments through the day.",

Shafik, known by her nickname of Minouche, will oversee banking and markets in a newly created job at the Bank and will join the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates. The Egyptian-born economist is a British and US national. She joins in August with an impressive record in academia and public service, shaped by her early life in Egypt. As deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund for almost three years she has overseen work on Europe and the Middle East and has managed the IMF's $1bn (\u00a3600m) administrative budget. Shafik, who is 51, is already well connected in the UK after working as permanent secretary at the Department for International Development (Dfid) for three years before joining the IMF. At Dfid she was the main sounding board for ministers and appeared regularly before parliament. Before Dfid, she was the youngest ever vice president of the World Bank and was responsible for $50bn of investments. Shafik was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1962 but her family left Egypt in the 1960s after her father lost everything during the country's nationalisation. Those early years had a profound influence on her. \"When you live in a poor country, you're surrounded by poverty and so that natural interest in why some people have and other people don't is always there,\" she said in 2001. \"I guess the particular angle that I have on development comes from the fact that my family was nationalised, and when that occurred, I left as a child and was raised in the US and didn't go back to Egypt until I was a teenager. But that experience of nationalisation and struggling with the role of the state trying to take resources, to redistribute them, but at the same time not being very successful at it was a part of my childhood.\" After finishing high school in Egypt she went back to the US, graduating in economics and politics from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst where she completed a BA in economics and politics. Two years of working on development issues in Egypt followed before she took an MSc in economics at the LSE by a doctorate in economics from St Antony's College, Oxford. Shafik married Raffael Jovine in 2002 and has a daughter, a son and three stepchildren. In her Who's Who entry she lists her interests as \"family, friends, museums, theatre, occasionally reading, walking and yoga\". On top of her academic and policy record, she has proved herself to be an effective administrator under stressful conditions. She joined the IMF shortly before it was thrown into turmoil by allegations of rape against its then managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn. As well as managing the IMF's budget, Shafik oversaw human resources for its 3,000 staff and its training for policy makers around the world. With that kind of experience she is now surely in the running to become the Bank's first female governor when Mark Carney steps down.",

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney stamps authority on Bank of England with deputy appointments | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is all change at the Bank of England. The new appointments were formally announced by George Osborne but show the governor, Mark Carney, stamping his authority all over Threadneedle Street. Before moving on to the winners and losers, it is worth commenting on the rationale behind the need for a deputy governor for markets and banking. Quite simply, the extra work load heaped on the Bank in the aftermath of the financial crisis means that there is a risk of Carney being asked to do too much: monetary policy, strategic oversight of the City, keeping an eye on individual banks and ensuring the financial markets work smoothly and honestly. The governor remains ultimately responsible for all these tasks, but can now delegate some of the responsibility to four deputies. Ben Broadbent gets monetary policy; the former Treasury mandarin John Cunliffe looks after financial stability; Andrew Bailey takes care of prudential regulation of the banks; Nemat Shafik takes up the new post of deputy governor for markets and banking. There are two key parts of Shafik's role. Firstly, to ensure that the markets are cleaned up after the scandals involving Libor and foreign exchange traders. The Bank's own involvement in these affairs is currently under scrutiny, and the appointment of a high-profile outsider \u2013 Shafik's role at the IMF makes her Britain's most senior official in an international body \u2013 shows Carney's concern about the potential damage the scandals are doing to Threadneedle Street's image. The second, perhaps even more daunting, task for Shafik is to work out a way of unwinding the Bank's quantitative easing programme. This is the initiative that pumped money into the banking system through the purchase of \u00a3375bn in government bonds. Buying the bonds has helped suppress long-term interest rates; the task for the new deputy governor is to devise a means of selling them back to the markets without jeopardising economic growth. Two other things about the new structure are worthy of mention. Broadbent's move from being an external member of the MPC to a full-time Bank official adds to the sense that Goldman Sachs runs the world. Both Carney and Broadbent have worked at Goldmans. Secondly, Shafik's appointment does something to remedy the gender imbalance at the Bank. As for the personnel changes, Paul Fisher, the executive director for markets, has carried the can for the Libor and forex scandals. He loses his place on the MPC. Spencer Dale, currently chief economist, was a candidate to replace Charlie Bean as deputy governor for monetary policy but lost out to Broadbent. Dale appears to have paid the price for the Bank's less than stellar record for economic forecasting and does a job swap with Andy Haldane, executive director for financial stability. What do the changes add up to? Clearly, the Bank's organisational structure needed to be updated to take account of the fact that it is no longer simply an institution that does monetary policy. That re-organisation is now in place. All the coming and going means there will be a vacancy for an external member of the MPC. It is unlikely, however, that the public will notice much of a change to monetary policy; although Shafik's views are unknown the balance of hawks and doves remains unchanged. Finally, the appointment of Shafik is bound to prompt speculation that she will become the Bank's first female governor when Carney's term ends in the summer of 2018.",

      "body": "<p>It is all change at the Bank of England. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/18/bank-of-england-nemak-shafik-ben-broadbent-deputy-governors\" title=\"\">new appointments were formally announced by George Osborne</a> but show the governor, Mark Carney, stamping his authority all over Threadneedle Street.</p> <p>Before moving on to the winners and losers, it is worth commenting on the rationale behind the need for a deputy governor for markets and banking. Quite simply, the extra work load heaped on the Bank in the aftermath of the financial crisis means that there is a risk of Carney being asked to do too much: monetary policy, strategic oversight of the City, keeping an eye on individual banks and ensuring the financial markets work smoothly and honestly.</p> <p>The governor remains ultimately responsible for all these tasks, but can now delegate some of the responsibility to four deputies. Ben Broadbent gets monetary policy; the former Treasury mandarin John Cunliffe looks after financial stability; Andrew Bailey takes care of prudential regulation of the banks; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/18/nemat-shafik-economist-stellar-cv-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">Nemat Shafik takes up the new post of deputy governor for markets and banking</a>.</p> <p>There are two key parts of Shafik's role. Firstly, to ensure that the markets are cleaned up after the scandals involving Libor and foreign exchange traders. The Bank's own involvement in these affairs is currently under scrutiny, and the appointment of a high-profile outsider \u2013 Shafik's role at the IMF makes her Britain's most senior official in an international body \u2013 shows Carney's concern about the potential damage the scandals are doing to Threadneedle Street's image.</p> <p>The second, perhaps even more daunting, task for Shafik is to work out a way of unwinding the Bank's quantitative easing programme. This is the initiative that pumped money into the banking system through the purchase of \u00a3375bn in government bonds. Buying the bonds has helped suppress long-term interest rates; the task for the new deputy governor is to devise a means of selling them back to the markets without jeopardising economic growth.</p> <p>Two other things about the new structure are worthy of mention. Broadbent's move from being an external member of the MPC to a full-time Bank official adds to the sense that Goldman Sachs runs the world. Both Carney and Broadbent have worked at Goldmans. Secondly, Shafik's appointment does something to remedy the gender imbalance at the Bank.</p> <p>As for the personnel changes, Paul Fisher, the executive director for markets, has carried the can for the Libor and forex scandals. He loses his place on the MPC. Spencer Dale, currently chief economist, was a candidate to replace Charlie Bean as deputy governor for monetary policy but lost out to Broadbent. Dale appears to have paid the price for the Bank's less than stellar record for economic forecasting and does a job swap with Andy Haldane, executive director for financial stability.</p> <p>What do the changes add up to? Clearly, the Bank's organisational structure needed to be updated to take account of the fact that it is no longer simply an institution that does monetary policy. That re-organisation is now in place. All the coming and going means there will be a vacancy for an external member of the MPC. It is unlikely, however, that the public will notice much of a change to monetary policy; although Shafik's views are unknown the balance of hawks and doves remains unchanged.</p> <p>Finally, the appointment of Shafik is bound to prompt speculation that she will become the Bank's first female governor when Carney's term ends in the summer of 2018.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Barclays has further stoked the row over bankers' pay by handing out shares worth almost \u00a332m to its management team, including the under-fire chief executive Antony Jenkins. Jenkins \u2013 who has insisted the bank had to pay higher bonuses to avoid a \"death spiral\" caused by a mass walkout of key staff \u2013 received shares worth almost \u00a33.8m from bonuses handed to him up to three years ago. But the highest reward to one of the 12-strong executive committee was \u00a38.8m for Skip McGee, who joined Barclays in New York when it took over the Wall Street operations of Lehman Brothers. McGee is running Barclays America and his pay is being disclosed for the first time. He is one of the three Barclays investment bankers whose pay is being published following the departure of Rich Ricci, who was handed \u00a317.6m a year ago. Comparisons with a year ago \u2013 when the bank incensed politicians by announcing \u00a339.5m of bonuses on budget day \u2013 are difficult, as the composition of the management team has changed dramatically and the share price has fallen from 308p to 232p. But the Robin Hood tax campaign for a tax on financial transactions said the payments \"turn the stomach\". \"It's a reminder we live in two-tier Britain where bankers pocket huge rewards come rain or shine and the rest of us pay to clear up their mess,\" said a spokesman for the campaign. The payments to the executive committee relate to vested bonuses that are now due. A total of 13.6m shares \u2013 more than the 12.7m last year \u2013 were released to the 12 members of the executive committee, which a year ago had nine members. Since Ricci's departure the investment bank has been run by two co-heads in London, Eric Bommensath and Tom King, who were handed \u00a38.6m and \u00a33.8m respectively. Their long-term future at the bank is uncertain as a review of Barclays' investment banking operation is already under way, with Jenkins under pressure from shareholders to cut costs and stick to his pledge to reduce the proportion of revenues paid out to bankers. Investors will vote on the pay policies at next month's annual meeting and debate is already raging about whether to back the rewards, which Jenkins has argued are needed to retain top investment bankers. investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, has warned that the backlash against high pay could make it difficult for UK investment banks to survive in competition with the big US banks. This year's payments also include the first tranches of new role-based pay, introduced to get around the EU bonus cap that restricts bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% with shareholder approval. The so-called allowances were described by EU financial services commissioner Michel Barnier yesterday as \"a new category of invented revenue\" designed to \"sidestep\" the cap. Promoted to the top job in 2012 after Bob Diamond was forced out in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal, Jenkins is on track to get \u00a3950,000 a year in role-based allowances. But, along with the new finance director, Tushar Morzaria, who received \u00a31m of shares, he will have to wait until shareholders have voted on the allowances next month. Jenkins waived his bonus for 2013, when the bank raised \u00a35.8bn in a cash call to bolster its balance sheet. But in addition to the latest release of \u00a33.8m of shares, the bank's annual report published earlier this month said he also cashed in \u00a35.2m of previous share awards and was awarded a further \u00a34m that could pay out in the years ahead. All the directors sold enough shares to pay their tax liabilities. The head of risk, Robert Le Blanc, sold slightly more than this.",

      "bodyText": "The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, has accused critics of \u201cplaying the safety card as a tool of industrial relations\u201d and argued that changes to the Qantas Sale Act would not subject passengers to greater danger. Joyce\u2019s testimony to a Senate committee hearing on Tuesday night came as the airline hit back at dramatic claims, aired last week, that passengers had been put at risk by a failure to properly secure three engines on a Qantas plane after maintenance conducted in Hong Kong in 2008. Joyce also told the committee he believed he had the unanimous support of the Qantas board but he had not spoken to each member individually. He brushed off questions about taking personal responsibility for presiding over a big decline in the share price, instead blaming the operating environment with major competitors being subject to different laws. The Senate economics legislation committee was investigating the Abbott government\u2019s proposed legislation to abolish part three of the Qantas Sale Act, which imposes a 49% cap on the total foreign ownership of the company. This section of the act also requires that facilities, including maintenance and catering, used by Qantas in the provision of international services are principally located in Australia. Joyce began his testimony by saying the changes were needed to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d with key competitor Virgin Australia, which had gained from injections of foreign capital, before turning his attention to union concerns about the safety of offshore maintenance. \u201cWe have seen a line being run by the unions that the prospect of repealing section three of the Qantas Sale Act will have negative safety implications. This is blatant fear mongering,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cIt is playing the safety card as a tool of industrial relations.\u201d Qantas issued a statement on Tuesday to address the Hong Kong maintenance case referred to by the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association (ALAEA). The airline said the issue related to washers, not bolts. One engine had three of the eight washers installed upside down while two engines had one washer installed instead of two on the bolts, the company said. Qantas \u201ccategorically rejected\u201d suggestions the safety of the aircraft was at risk \u201cas a result of what was a minor maintenance issue\u201d. \u201cThe claim that the engines could have fallen off the aircraft during the flight as a consequence is false and alarmist,\u201d it said. Joyce told the Senate committee that Qantas had an \u201cabsolute\u201d commitment to safety and an \u201cexemplary track record\u201d. He said the majority of Qantas\u2019s maintenance was done in Australia, but A380s and B747s were maintained overseas. \u201cAs always in aviation, there are multiple failsafes to account for the very small likelihood of human error. Suggesting that any mistake is a potential catastrophe is alarmist and deeply irresponsible,\u201d Joyce said. The ALAEA federal secretary, Steve Purvinas, who raised the safety fears about the Hong Kong case, told the committee on Tuesday night that he still held concerns about oversight by the Australia\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Purvinas said maintenance conducted in Australia was subject to more supervision than in Asia. He said there was a \u201cdifferent culture\u201d in relation to reporting of safety issues and fears of staff not having their contracts renewed. The Coalition government is unlikely to secure Senate support to remove the 49% foreign ownership cap on Qantas and the requirement for operations to be mainly based in Australia, with Labor and the Greens opposing the legislation. Tony Abbott has argued Qantas must be freed from the \u201cshackles\u201d of the Qantas Sale Act to compete on a level playing field, but its international operations would remain subject to a 49% foreign ownership cap under the Air Navigation Act. Senators questioned Joyce about the prospect of restructuring Qantas into a majority foreign-owned domestic operation and a majority Australian-owned international business. He said Virgin had the flexibility to site its heavy maintenance and call centre operations offshore and could attract foreign capital, and Qantas should gain the same flexibility. Qantas has already announced plans to cut 5,000 jobs as part of a $2bn cost-saving drive. Joyce did not respond directly to questions about the prospect of further cuts, and sending more jobs offshore, if the changes to the Qantas Sale Act passed the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s hypothetical,\u201d said Joyce, who took a similar position when fronting a separate Senate committee hearing about Qantas on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m not going to rule anything in or anything out.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Continuing tensions in the Ukraine as governments await Russia's next move have sent markets lower in early trading.</p> <p>But Chilean copper miner <strong>Antofagasta</strong> has gained ground after unveiling a larger than expected dividend hike despite a 30% drop in full year profits to $2.7bn. Lower metal prices and rising costs outweighed an increase in output, but Antofagasta said it would pay a final dividend of 86.1\u00a2 a share making a total payout of 95\u00a2, well above forecasts of 38.9\u00a2. Chief executive Diego Hernandez told Reuters:</p> <blockquote> We have been accumulating cash for some time. This money doesn't earn high interest rates, as you can imagine, in this market. Then we decided to give back to shareholders through (the) dividend while of course ensuring that we have got enough money to go ahead with our portfolio of projects. </blockquote> <p>So its shares have jumped 27.5p to 875p, despite saying this year would be \"a year of consolidation.\" There was a mixed response from analysts. Marc Elliott at Investec pointed out that the founding Luksic family would benefit from the dividend hike and despite the increased payout, he retained his sell rating:</p> <blockquote> This [dividend] is well above expectations and clearly reflects a desire to return surplus cash to shareholders (Luksic family at around 65%) given the strong balance sheet. However, we continue to see the shares as fundamentally overvalued, particularly given the current volatile copper pricing environment. <br> </blockquote> <p>But Nick Hatch at Westhouse was positive:</p> <blockquote> EBITDA was slightly below our estimate but bang in line with consensus. Net profits missed expectations, but largely as a result of the significantly greater than expected dividend. The changed dividend policy will ensure that 35% of net earnings is paid out (after consideration of cash requirements). On the full-year payment, the stock is yielding 6.7% \u2013 what's not to like. We expect the shares to perform well today. <br> </blockquote> <p>But with gold and silver edging lower, Mexican silver miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> has fallen 46p to 878.5p while <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> is down 76p to \u00a348.93.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has fallen 16.24 points to 6552.11 after Monday's rise - the first in seven days amid the uncertainty in Ukraine and ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. Rebecca O'Keeffe at Interactive Investor said:</p> <blockquote> The current limited action imposed on Russia does not appear to have had a major impact on investor sentiment yet, with investors relying on the idea that self-interest in Europe will prevent the threat of more aggressive sanctions.

      "bodyText": "Continuing tensions in the Ukraine as governments await Russia's next move have sent markets lower in early trading. But Chilean copper miner Antofagasta has gained ground after unveiling a larger than expected dividend hike despite a 30% drop in full year profits to $2.7bn. Lower metal prices and rising costs outweighed an increase in output, but Antofagasta said it would pay a final dividend of 86.1\u00a2 a share making a total payout of 95\u00a2, well above forecasts of 38.9\u00a2. Chief executive Diego Hernandez told Reuters: We have been accumulating cash for some time. This money doesn't earn high interest rates, as you can imagine, in this market. Then we decided to give back to shareholders through (the) dividend while of course ensuring that we have got enough money to go ahead with our portfolio of projects. So its shares have jumped 27.5p to 875p, despite saying this year would be \"a year of consolidation.\" There was a mixed response from analysts. Marc Elliott at Investec pointed out that the founding Luksic family would benefit from the dividend hike and despite the increased payout, he retained his sell rating: This [dividend] is well above expectations and clearly reflects a desire to return surplus cash to shareholders (Luksic family at around 65%) given the strong balance sheet. However, we continue to see the shares as fundamentally overvalued, particularly given the current volatile copper pricing environment. But Nick Hatch at Westhouse was positive: EBITDA was slightly below our estimate but bang in line with consensus. Net profits missed expectations, but largely as a result of the significantly greater than expected dividend. The changed dividend policy will ensure that 35% of net earnings is paid out (after consideration of cash requirements). On the full-year payment, the stock is yielding 6.7% \u2013 what's not to like. We expect the shares to perform well today. But with gold and silver edging lower, Mexican silver miner Fresnillo has fallen 46p to 878.5p while Randgold Resources is down 76p to \u00a348.93. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 16.24 points to 6552.11 after Monday's rise - the first in seven days amid the uncertainty in Ukraine and ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. Rebecca O'Keeffe at Interactive Investor said: The current limited action imposed on Russia does not appear to have had a major impact on investor sentiment yet, with investors relying on the idea that self-interest in Europe will prevent the threat of more aggressive sanctions. However, the major issue is not Crimea, but the potential for further fallout in mainland Ukraine, with a breakup in the east of the country a real possibility... If [Putin] continues to take a hard line on the matter, investor optimism that the issue is resolved may be misplaced. Janet Yellen chairs her first Fed meeting over the next two days and with US numbers all continuing to improve, the only surprise would be if the current Fed policy on tapering were to change. However Yellen does need to address the question of forward guidance and what the Fed will do when unemployment reaches their target of 6.5%, with the expectation being that they will simply change to more qualitative guidance. Back in the UK J Sainsbury has dipped 0.6p to 310.8p after its first sale fall for nine years, albeit this was widely expected. Among the mid-caps there were more dramatic reactions to trading updates. Housebuilder Berkeley has risen 42p to \u00a326.94 after it said it expected to complete 30% more homes than the 2007 market peak. IG has added 9.5p to 639.5p as the spread betting group said third quarter revenues had risen by 9%. But Cairn Energy is down 19.3p at 177.2p after it decided to halt a $300m share buyback while Indian authorities investigate its income tax payments over the last seven years. Cairn also reported a $556m loss after the costs of unsuccessful exploration projects in Morocco and the north sea.",
