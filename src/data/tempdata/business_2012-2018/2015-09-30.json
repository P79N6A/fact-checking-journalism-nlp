    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On a late Saturday morning earlier this month, hundreds of people gathered under a navy blue tent at Brandywine Creek in Wilmington, Delaware, in preparation to pick up trash. Philadelphia-based outdoor lifestyle company United By Blue has been organizing these waterway cleanups since the company was founded in 2010, but this day was a bit different. It marked the company\u2019s 140th cleanup, on target to collect 250,000lb of waste from beaches and waterways. In 2007, United By Blue founder Brian Linton started Sand Shack, a company that sold resort jewelry, and donated some of the revenue to nonprofits focused on ocean and waterway conservation. \u201cWhen I started the business in college, I figured the way to do good in business is to give money away,\u201d Linton said. \u201cAnd that was the natural thought process of a 20-year-old. And the reality over the course of three years became that, it\u2019s a good model for bigger businesses \u2013 and it\u2019s a noble thing for anybody to do \u2013 but to me, it didn\u2019t really have any tangible impact.\u201d When Linton founded United By Blue, he decided to be the one contributing to the conservation efforts, and not with money, but with the company\u2019s own manpower. The plan was to pick up a pound of trash for every product. And now, at about 220,000 products sold, United By Blue has more than stuck to its promise. The company joins the ranks of other outdoor companies trying to give back to the environment. In 2012, on Black Friday, one of the largest companies in the outdoor lifestyle industry, Patagonia, asked their customers to stop buying things they don\u2019t need in their \u201cCommon Threads\u201d campaign. Instead, the company urged people to repair and recycle their clothes, to cut down on waste and the resources necessary to produce a new jacket. Groups like the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and the Outdoor Industry Association\u2019s Sustainability Working Group have created indexes to push for more responsible action. All this effort could have a big impact. The Outdoor Industry Association estimates about 60% of American adults classify themselves as outdoor consumers, and each spends about $137 annually on outdoor apparel. United By Blue got its start selling graphic T-shirts, and expanded to a full line of apparel for men and women with pants, dresses and socks. They also sell items like artisan paddles and hand-painted axes, which blur the line between art and function. They also stock brands \u2013 like Red Wing boots \u2013 the company has deemed to further their own message of sustainably produced goods. They sell their products online and in national retail stores like Urban Outfitters, Nordstrom, and REI, as well as various local outdoor retailers and, as of 2013, in their own coffee shop-retail hybrid stores. The first hybrid store is located in the ground floor of United By Blue\u2019s headquarters, on a quiet street in the historic neighborhood of Old City, Philadelphia. The business office is on the second floor, with a photo studio and conference room on the third. Linton calls it a \u201cvertical business\u201d. The company has another shop in University City, which Linton said is smaller but busier. This summer, the company also opened a pop-up shop in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Between the two shops, the company employs 24 people, with 13 on the operations side. The small shops also serve as a community space \u2013 tables and desks are handmade from reclaimed wood, and the light fixtures in United By Blue\u2019s University City store are made from recycled industrial whisks from a Tastykake factory. This is emblematic of another particular obsession in the company \u2013 creating \u201cresponsible, durable goods\u201d. And for apparel, that starts with materials. \u201cIn the entire line, we only have a handful of fibers that we use,\u201d Linton said. \u201cA lot of the synthetics are what fast fashion uses. So we have a lot of cotton, wool, bison, recycled polyester, tencel \u2013 those are our main materials in the line.\u201c About that bison: last November, the company started a Kickstarter campaign for a $38 pair of socks. It sounds ridiculous, but the team dubbed it the \u201cUltimate American Sock\u201d, because it was made from the downy part of a bison\u2019s coat. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing meat industry for the bison in the US, and unfortunately a lot of that fiber is discarded,\u201d Linton said. \u201cSo there was this \u2018aha!\u2019 moment where the bison fiber is actually a technical, warm fiber, and it\u2019s not being used to its full advantage or its full potential. So I got my hands on some. I bought 30lb of it to start playing around with it.\u201d Despite the high price tag, Linton\u2019s company has sold more than 10,000 pairs of the socks so far, with demand that far surpasses the supply chain. This fall, they\u2019re expanding to a jacket made with the coarser outer layer of bison fur. However, there are some sustainability hurdles United By Blue has yet to clear \u2013 like plastic. \u201cWe are very focused on picking up plastics out of the ocean, but in doing business in this industry, many factories love to put plastic around anything,\u201d Linton said. A couple years ago, United By Blue tried wrapping their garments in paper bags instead of plastic. But straying from the norm confused retailers, who worried the products would get damaged without a protective plastic covering. \u201cSo we\u2019re reevaluating how do we reduce and ultimately remove plastic from the supply chain, and how do we do that responsibly while not losing sales, because at the end of the day, the business is a business,\u201d Linton said. The company\u2019s commitment to sustainability has earned United By Blue a B Corporation certification. B Lab, the nonprofit that gives out the certificate, likens it to LEED certification for green buildings. The most visible part of that commitment is the waterway cleanups. Since 2010, the company has prompted more than 4,500 volunteers to get out and clear trash from beaches and coasts in 24 US states, as well as Canada. To mobilize all those volunteers, the company partners with companies like Subaru, and organizations like the National Park Service and the Nature Conservancy, as well as local outdoor retailers. All had representatives on hand at Brandywine Creek in Delaware at the big September cleanup. As the day tipped toward afternoon, volunteers trekked back to the tent to weigh their catch, telling stories of a near bee attack, or towing a waterlogged inner tube. The line to weigh the trash snaked its way through the park. Kids and their parents, groups of teens and couples of all ages showed up to collect, showing off the weirdest items found, like a collection of shoes or old knives and hubcaps. The strangest item (a collection of various shoes) won a prize, as did the lucky volunteer who had the closest guess at the total weight of the day\u2019s haul. By the end of the cleanup, the group had far surpassed the 400lb needed to reach the 250,000lb goal, gathering more than 1,800lb in total. pounds. To celebrate, the United By Blue team stopped for lunch at a nearby pizza place to celebrate, and lamented that their food was served on styrofoam.",

The <a href=\"https://outdoorindustry.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outdoor Industry Association</a> estimates about 60% of American adults classify themselves as outdoor consumers, and each spends about $137 annually on outdoor apparel. </p> <p>United By Blue got its start selling graphic T-shirts, and expanded to a full line of apparel for men and women with pants, dresses and socks. They also sell items like artisan paddles and hand-painted axes, which blur the line between art and function. They also stock brands \u2013 like Red Wing boots \u2013 the company has deemed to further their own message of sustainably produced goods. They sell their products online and in national retail stores like <a href=\"http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Urban Outfitters</a>, <a href=\"http://shop.nordstrom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nordstrom</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">REI</a>, as well as various local outdoor retailers and, as of 2013, in their own coffee shop-retail hybrid stores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/23/craft-beer-wildfires-northwest-drought-hops-artisinal\">Craft beers are in trouble as drought and fire savage the Pacific Northwest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first hybrid store is located in the ground floor of United By Blue\u2019s headquarters, on a quiet street in the historic neighborhood of Old City, Philadelphia. The business office is on the second floor, with a photo studio and conference room on the third. Linton calls it a \u201cvertical business\u201d. The company has another shop in University City, which Linton said is smaller but busier. This summer, the company also opened a pop-up shop in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Between the two shops, the company employs 24 people, with 13 on the operations side.</p> <p>The small shops also serve as a community space \u2013 tables and desks are handmade from reclaimed wood, and the light fixtures in United By Blue\u2019s University City store are made from recycled industrial whisks from a Tastykake factory. This is emblematic of another particular obsession in the company \u2013 creating \u201cresponsible, durable goods\u201d. And for apparel, that starts with materials.</p> <p>\u201cIn the entire line, we only have a handful of fibers that we use,\u201d Linton said. \u201cA lot of the synthetics are what fast fashion uses. So we have a lot of cotton, wool, bison, recycled polyester, tencel \u2013 those are our main materials in the line.\u201c</p> <p>About that bison: last November, the company started a Kickstarter campaign for a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brianlinton/the-ultimate-american-sock-made-from-bison-wool\" rel=\"nofollow\">$38 pair of socks</a>. It sounds ridiculous, but the team dubbed it the \u201cUltimate American Sock\u201d, because it was made from the downy part of a bison\u2019s coat.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a growing meat industry for the bison in the US, and unfortunately a lot of that fiber is discarded,\u201d Linton said. \u201cSo there was this \u2018aha!\u2019 moment where the bison fiber is actually a technical, warm fiber, and it\u2019s not being used to its full advantage or its full potential. So I got my hands on some. I bought 30lb of it to start playing around with it.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the high price tag, Linton\u2019s company has sold more than 10,000 pairs of the socks so far, with demand that far surpasses the supply chain. This fall, they\u2019re expanding to a jacket made with the coarser outer layer of bison fur.</p> <p>However, there are some sustainability hurdles United By Blue has yet to clear \u2013 like plastic. </p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>We are very focused on picking up plastics out of the ocean, but in doing business in this industry, many factories love to put plastic around anything,\u201d Linton said. </p> <p>A couple years ago, United By Blue tried wrapping their garments in paper bags instead of plastic. But straying from the norm confused retailers, who worried the products would get damaged without a protective plastic covering. \u201cSo we\u2019re reevaluating how do we reduce and ultimately remove plastic from the supply chain, and how do we do that responsibly while not losing sales, because at the end of the day, the business is a business,\u201d Linton said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/aug/27/new-orleans-fishermen-hurricane-katrina-fishing-industry-bp-oil-spill-hurricane-rita\">After Katrina and BP, Louisiana fishermen battle back from the brink</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company\u2019s commitment to sustainability has earned United By Blue a B Corporation certification. B Lab, the nonprofit that gives out the certificate, likens it to LEED certification for green buildings.</p> <p>The most visible part of that commitment is the waterway cleanups. Since 2010, the company has prompted more than 4,500 volunteers to get out and clear trash from beaches and coasts in 24 US states, as well as Canada.</p> <p>To mobilize all those volunteers, the company partners with companies like Subaru, and organizations like the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Park Service</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nature.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nature Conservancy</a>, as well as local outdoor retailers. All had representatives on hand at Brandywine Creek in Delaware at the big September cleanup. As the day tipped toward afternoon, volunteers trekked back to the tent to weigh their catch, telling stories of a near bee attack, or towing a waterlogged inner tube.</p> <p>The line to weigh the trash snaked its way through the park. Kids and their parents, groups of teens and couples of all ages showed up to collect, showing off the weirdest items found, like a collection of shoes or old knives and hubcaps. The strangest item (a collection of various shoes) won a prize, as did the lucky volunteer who had the closest guess at the total weight of the day\u2019s haul.</p> <p>By the end of the cleanup, the group had far surpassed the 400lb needed to reach the 250,000lb goal, gathering more than 1,800lb in total. pounds. </p> <p>To celebrate, the United By Blue team stopped for lunch at a nearby pizza place to celebrate, and lamented that their food was served on styrofoam.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here comes Tony Hayward to show the doubters they have got it wrong about Glencore. The chairman has put his hand in his pocket to buy some shares. He\u2019s splashed out the mighty sum of, well, nearly \u00a391,000. It would be a chunky sum for most of us, admittedly, but Hayward earns a shade over $1m a year, or \u00a3700,000, at Glencore and is a wealthy man from his long stint at BP. It\u2019s not exactly a bold act of faith. For his next adventure, Hayward could try something different. Try explaining in detail how non-executives \u201cchallenge\u201d the executives at Glencore, a process he championed in last year\u2019s annual report. Did Hayward express any doubts to chief executive Ivan Glasenberg about the wisdom of last autumn\u2019s $1bn share buy-back? That cash would come in handy now. Instead Glencore squandered it by buying its own shares at about 300p a pop, versus Wednesday\u2019s 91p. And, given the group\u2019s debts of $30bn, why was a same-again interim dividend sanctioned in August? It looked reckless, as the shareholders themselves pointed out. A fortnight later, even before the cheques had been dispatched, Glencore, in effect, had to ask for the money back via a \u00a31.6bn placing. Buy a few shares, by all means, but answers on governance at Glencore would be more valuable. Trouble brewing for AB InBev/SAB combo? Altria and the Colombian Santo Domingo family, the two big shareholders in SABMiller, will smile upon a bid from Anheuser-Busch InBev at the right price, so we are led to believe. It\u2019s probably true, and the deed could be done any day. But maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 the Santo Domingos will spring a surprise. They did in 2005 when they sold their 65-year-old brewing business to SAB for $7.8bn, thereby acquiring their 14% stake. The red-hot favourite had been Heineken, which was thought to have offered $1bn more for Bavaria. Chairman Julio Mario Santo Domingo, who died six years later, explained his thinking at an entertaining press conference. \u201cWe married for beauty, not for money,\u201d he declared. Easy to say if you\u2019re a billionaire, of course. But nephew Carlos P\u00e9rez D\u00e1vila, one of the family\u2019s representatives on SAB\u2019s board to this day, provided the harder business rationale. \u201cValue was important but we were looking for something deeper than that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were looking for a place to park this asset, hopefully for another generation.\u201d It was an excellent choice. SAB\u2019s shares at the time were 900p-ish and they had improved to \u00a330 even before the Brazilians at AB InBev showed up. It may be that the Santo Domingos now think their shares are best parked with AB InBev for next generation. What\u2019s more, the talents of Graham Mackay were clearly part of the calculation back in 2005; sadly, SAB\u2019s chief executive died a couple of years ago. But it is just possible the Santo Domingos may wish to stick with SAB, a company that has served them well. They would still have to persuade Altria, the tobacco firm that owns 27%, to stay loyal, but at least there would be the prospect of a bar-room quarrel. Let\u2019s hope so, because Megabrew, as an AB InBev/SAB combo has been dubbed, should be nobody\u2019s idea of a beautiful marriage. It would be a monopolistic, high-debt fling in which drinkers will end up paying more. In Colombian long-termism, we trust (sort of). Sainsbury\u2019s not out of woods just yet Sainsbury\u2019s expects its pre-tax profits this year to be \u201cmoderately\u201d ahead of the previous consensus City forecast of \u00a3548m, but there was nothing moderate about the share price reaction \u2013 up nearly 14%. There was a strong smell of burnt fingers in the market: Sainsbury\u2019s has been one of the most heavily-shorted shares in the FTSE 100 index. But, before shareholders get too excited, they should take a step back. Defying the City\u2019s gloom-mongers puts a feather in the cap of chief executive Mike Coupe, but it does not mean Sainsbury\u2019s profits will increase this year. It would require a miraculous second-half to beat last year\u2019s outcome of \u00a3681m. Indeed, the company is still on course for its lowest profits since 2009. Let\u2019s not be too churlish, though. Sainsbury\u2019s, through the downturn, did not suffer any calamity in the style of Tesco and Morrisons. It is a tightly-managed operation and all those boasts management likes to trot out \u2013 about every industry award won, and this time even the improved \u201cripeness and quality of our avocados\u201d \u2013 are clearly finding an audience. There is a sense that trading conditions are improving slightly. Very welcome, but we\u2019re still talking about like-for-like sales declines. You wouldn\u2019t call it stability yet.",

At this level they are just below the 97p price at which they closed on Friday, before Monday\u2019s rout, but remain well below the 125p at which Glencore raised \u00a31.6bn to bolster its financial position. The 2011 float price put a \u00a36bn value on the stake of its boss Ivan Glasenberg. His stake is now worth less than \u00a31bn as a result of the slide in the share price. Analysts at Capital Economics said the problems at Glencore could mark a trough in the price of many commodities. Fears about China should fade, the economists said. Pessimistic headlines were often a good time to take a contrarian view, they said, adding: \u201cAnd perhaps more substantially, the problems at Glencore provide one of the clearest illustrations yet of the challenges faced by commodity producers at current low prices. \u201cThe resulting supply response \u2013 slower growth in output, if not outright cuts \u2013 should feed back into a recovery in prices.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "With this, we are wrapping up for the day. Good-bye and thank you for all your great comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Commissioner Jonathan Hill, the EU\u2019s financial services chief, said: Europe\u2019s economy is about the same size as America\u2019s, but our equity markets are less than half their size. In the US, SMEs get about five times as much funding from the capital markets \u2013 or non-bank financing - as they do here in the EU. And if our venture capital markets were as well developed as they are in the US, companies could have raised an extra EUR 90 billion over the past five years. And perhaps even more importantly, the differences that there are between EU Member States are greater than the differences between the EU and the US. So I think that if we can build stronger more sustainable capital markets and remove these barriers to cross-border investment, that there would be very clear benefits.\u201d You can read his speech here. The European Commission published its action plan on the Capital Markets Union initiative today, as expected, to create a \u201ctrue single market\u201d for capital access across the core 28 EU member states. The Bank of England said in response: We consider this Action Plan to be a further important step in moving closer to a single, integrated capital market in the EU, although we are yet to review the Commission\u2019s detailed proposals. CMU requires carefully planned measures combining early quick wins to maintain momentum and sustained effort over a number of years, all in a very wide range of areas, and we therefore welcome the Commission\u2019s step by step approach. In the short term, the proposed Regulation on a European framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation, represents a significant milestone. Given the potential implications for financial stability at European and domestic level, we have worked with the European Central Bank to promote a sustainable model of securitisation and support the European Commission\u2019s proposal on an EU framework for securitisation as part of the longer-term objective of growth in stable, market-based financing markets alongside bank lending.\u201d Over in Greece, newly re-elected prime minister Alexis Tsipras has predicted that the crisis-plagued country could soon be returning to international markets \u2013 if a deal on its debt burden is reached by the end of the year. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: Greece\u2019s return to the capital markets from which it has been shut would essentially mark the end of its great economic crisis. Barely ten days after his triumphant return to power \u2013 and before his new administration has even had time to make its policy statements before the Greek parliament \u2013 Alexis Tsipras has announced that his government\u2019s goal is to return to markets once it has sealed a deal over its monumental debt. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal \u2013 that has reverberated widely through the Greek media this afternoon\u2013 the leftist leader said: \u201cThe goal is to return to the markets \u2026 if there is a good decision on the debt issue, Greece could return to markets shortly after debt restructuring.\u201d At more than \u20ac320bn \u2013 and just over 180% of GDP - Greece\u2019 s debt load is by far the highest in Europe with the International Monetary Fund repeatedly saying that debt relief is imperative if the country\u2019s shattered economy is ever to recover. Talks aimed at debt restructuring are scheduled to begin once international creditors complete a much-anticipated review of the economy later this year. Speaking in New York, where he has been attending the UN General Assembly, Tsipras also said fiscal targets outlined in the country\u2019s latest bailout agreement \u2013 the third since its near brush with bankruptcy in late 2009 \u2013 were likely to be derailed by government efforts to cope with the migrant and refugee crisis that is also afflicting Greece. In the event that the crisis worsened the Greek premier said Athens would call on its partners to relax budget plans.\u201d Global markets have suffered their worst quarterly performance since the depths of the eurozone crisis in 2011, with an estimated $11tn (\u00a37tn) wiped off the value of world shares, despite a bounce today. Our markets correspondent, Nick Fletcher, writes: After a summer of wild swings, sparked by growing fears of a slowdown in China, leading shares have slumped from the record highs of a few months earlier, and are on track for their second quarterly decline in a row. The MSCI all-country world index, which monitors 23 developed and 23 emerging markets, has fallen nearly 11.5% since 30 June, marking its poorest quarterly outcome since the three months to September 2011. The FTSE 100 index, which hit a record high of 7103 in April, fell below 6,000 during the quarter and is down 7% over the three months despite a 152 point bounce on Wednesday to 6061. During the quarter the UK\u2019s leading index has seen \u00a3117bn wiped off its value. Again, this is its worst performance since September 2011 when it lost 13.7% during the quarter. The poorest performer is the Shanghai composite index, down 26% since the start of July and suffering its worst quarter since 2008.\u201d Markets have shrugged off warnings from IMF chief Christine Lagarde about the slowing world economy and rallied on the last day of a dismal quarter. Worries over Greece\u2019s debt crisis gave way to new fears over China\u2019s economic slowdown and market turmoil during the past three months. Most European indices rose more than 2% today, while stocks on Wall Street leapt over 1%. FTSE 100 index in London up 2.58%, or 152.37 points, at 6061.61 Dax in Frankfurt up 2.2% at 9660.44 CAC in Paris up 2.57% at 4455.29 \u201cThere was no sign of slowdown this afternoon, with a 200 point jump for the Dow Jones continuing the Western indices\u2019 attempts to end this most awful of awful quarters with a bang instead of a more apt whimper,\u201d says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadeax. Perhaps this evening\u2019s comments from Janet Yellen will provide more insight into what the US markets want at the moment; when the Fed chair suggested last week that a rate-hike will most likely occur in 2015 the American indices surged on the signs of some much-needed clarity. It will be interesting, then, to see if the markets have a similar reaction if Yellen drops any newsworthy nuggets of information into her speech in St Louis. With the Dow continuing the end of quarter party, the European indices could maintain the muscular, if meaningless, growth that began this morning. The UK\u2019s supermarket sector, buoyed by better-than-expected profit-promising comments from Sainsbury\u2019s, only widened its gains as the day went on, whilst the commodity stocks continued to rebound from Monday\u2019s mayhem. So that\u2019s effectively it for another quarter. Not that things will be radically different at the start of Q4; the timeline for a US rate-hike is still non-existent, Volkswagen is still only at the beginning of a long and costly scandal, and, most importantly, the Chinese economy is still stalling, more (unneeded) evidence of which will likely arrive tomorrow in the form of the country\u2019s manufacturing PMIs.\u201d Strong labour market data in the US lifted the dollar, while the euro was already under pressure from the eurozone\u2019s return to deflation on the back of weaker oil prices. The euro is trading 0.7% down against the dollar at $1.1170. It also dropped against the pound, by 0.6% to 78.83p. Eurozone prices dipped 0.1% on the year in September after rising 0.1% the previous month, remaining well below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Global equities are rallying on the last day of a bad quarter. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, sums up today\u2019s developments in the UK and European stock markets. There was a healthy sense of relief about the move higher in European shares on Wednesday. For a minute there on Monday, stocks were on the precipice of another China-induced thrashing. The past two days have just not produced the catalyst for the follow-through to the downside. A melt-up in copper prices which surged over 4% helped commodity-trader Glencore to another day of double-digit gains. Other mining stocks followed suit with Rio Tinto a top riser after the sale of its coal mine stake in Australia to New Hope. The mine sale gave Rio\u2019s balance sheet a welcome boost in the context of fears of over-leverage in the sector. Supermarket shares were the surprise leaders of the FTSE 100 after a well-received update from Sainsbury\u2019s. Shares of Sainsbury\u2019s jumped as much as 14% after the supermarket said profits would be \u201cmoderately\u201d higher than expected this year. Profits at Sainsbury\u2019s are still well down year over year but the slowing decline in like-for-like sales means 2015 profitability looks better than it did six months ago. Sainsbury\u2019s is a household name, and retail investors especially, will keep trying to pick the bottom before profits grow again. An unusually large part of Sainsbury\u2019s float is being shorted for a large cap stock so there\u2019s some big time short-covering going on. Even the smallest sign that the worst is behind the big supermarkets is likely to see double digit reactions in share prices like today. The problem for the Big Four is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be much letup from the discounters. Aldi is going all guns blazes with plans for online shopping and an aggressive store expansion in London expected to accelerate the discounter\u2019s UK market share growth.\u201d The IMF chief concluded her speech by quoting from the organisation\u2019s founding father, John Maynard Keynes. In the midst of the 1930s Great Depression, he wrote this: \u2018It is common to hear people say that the epoch of enormous economic progress is over. But I believe that is a wildly mistaken interpretation of what is happening to us. We are suffering not from the rheumatics of old age, but from the growing pains of over-rapid changes, from the painfulness of readjustment between one economic period and another.\u2019 Keynes\u2019s note of realism \u2013 and optimism \u2013 proved to be right, of course. I believe it is a fitting note on which to end. \u201cSo much for the diagnosis. What should be done?\u201d Lagarde asks. The risks can be managed by supporting demand, preserving financial stability, and implementing structural reforms. Lagarde warned of a new \u201cmediocre\u201d. If we put all this together, we see global growth that is disappointing and uneven. In addition, medium-term growth prospects have become weaker. The \u201cnew mediocre\u201d of which I warned exactly a year ago \u2013 the risk of low growth for a long time \u2013 looms closer. Why? Because potential growth is being held back by low productivity, population aging, and the legacies of the global financial crisis. High debt, low investment, and weak banks continue to burden some advanced economies, especially in Europe; and many emerging economies continue to face adjustments after their post-crisis credit and investment boom.\u201d She said the US Federal Reserve faces a \u201cdelicate balancing act: to normalise interest rates while minimising the risk of financial market disruption\u201d. The prospect of rising U.S. rates has already contributed to higher financing costs for some borrowers, including emerging and developing economies. This is part of a necessary adjustment in global financial conditions. The process, however, could be complicated by structural changes in fixed-income markets, which have become less liquid and more fragile \u2013 a recipe for market overreactions and disruptions. Outside the advanced economies, countries are generally better prepared for higher interest rates than in the past. And yet I am concerned about their capacity to buffer shocks. Why? Because many emerging and developing economies responded to the global financial crisis with bold counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary actions. By using these policy buffers, they were able to lead the global economy in its time of need. And over the past five years, they have accounted for almost 80% of global growth. These policy actions generally went together with an increase in financial leverage in the private sector, and many countries have incurred more debt \u2013 a significant portion of which is in U.S dollars. She warned that rising US interest rate and a stronger dollar could reveal currency mismatches, leading to corporate defaults. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has warned that a deceleration in emerging markets will cause global economic growth to slow this year. Bright spots are the eurozone and Japan, where growth is picking up, and the US and the UK, where growth is still solid. She said: Global growth will likely be weaker this year than last, with only a modest acceleration expected in 2016.\u201d The good news is that we are seeing a modest pickup in advanced economies. The moderate recovery is strengthening in the euro area; Japan is returning to positive growth; and activity remains robust in the US and the UK as well. The not-so-good news is that emerging economies are likely to see their fifth consecutive year of declining rates of growth. India remains a bright spot. China is slowing down as it rebalances away from export-led growth. Countries such as Russia and Brazil are facing serious economic difficulties. Growth in Latin American countries, in general, continues to slow sharply. We are also seeing weaker activity in low-income countries \u2013 which will be increasingly affected by the worsening external environment.\u201d She warned that emerging markets could be hit by a prolonged period of low commodity prices. The Washington-based organisation will release its World Economic Outlook next week. Here\u2019s a chart showing the performance of major commodities so far this year, via market watch. And no, oil and metals are not the worst performers: But there has also been some weak manufacturing data from the US. After contractions in manufacturing in the Empire, Philadelphia, Richmond and Dallas Federal Reserve regions in recent weeks, Chicago is the latest area to disappoint. The Chicago purchasing managers index for September fell from 54.4 in August to 48.7, well below forecasts of a level of 53. This is the lowest since May and the first contraction since June. These figures come ahead of the ISM manufacturing figures for September, and do not bode especially well. Wall Street has indeed opened sharply higher, in tandem with other global markets which are recovering some ground from their recent slump, writes Nick Fletcher. The US markets have also been helped by better than expected jobs figures with the monthly ADP report showing private employers added 200,000 jobs in September, up from 186,000 in August. That suggests that we could see a strong non-farm payrolls number on Friday, easing fears that the US economy is weaker than expected. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 1.2% or 203 points while the S&amp;P 500 has added 0.7% in early trading. But this will not stop global markets recording their worst quarterly performance since 2011, on growing fears about the state of the Chinese economy, a possible rise in US interest rates and the fallout from the VW emissions scandal. My colleague on the Money desk, Miles Brignall, has done a helpful Q&amp;A for UK consumers on which cars are affected by the Volkswagen emissions scandal and what they can do. You can read it here. Which engines are involved? Anyone with a EA189 engine \u2013 which to most buyers means 1.2 litre, 1.6 litre and 2.0 litres diesel engines. The affected vehicles were sold roughly between 2009 and 2014. This include Golfs, Passats, \u0160koda Octavias and Fabias, plus a host of Audis. What about other models? All petrol models, as well as V6 TDI and V8 TDI diesel engined vehicles, are unaffected, VW has said. The FTSE 100 index is still up strongly, boosted by Sainsbury\u2019s and other supermarket groups. Sainsbury\u2019s said today it is trading well and expects to beat annual profit forecasts. It is the top riser on the share index, up 13% or 29.9p at 259.2p. Tesco is up 6.8% while Morrisons is 5.6% ahead. The FTSE is nearly 2.1% ahead at 6032.41, a gain of more than 120 points. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.4% and France\u2019s CAC has gained 2.7%. Over in the US, Wall Street is set to open higher after strong labour market data. The ADP National Employment Report showed that private employers added 200,000 jobs in September, more than expected and up from 186,000 in August. This has boosted expectations of a strong payrolls number on Friday \u2013 the official data. Fed chair Janet Yellen and St Louis Fed president James Bullard are due to speak at a conference in St Louis later today, and markets will be looking for any clues regarding the timing of the first interest rate hike in years. ... But Britain\u2019s recovery from its economic slump and the financial crisis has been slower than previous recoveries. Output is only 5.9% above its previous peak in early 2008. Adjusted for the growing population, it\u2019s just 0.6% higher. Let\u2019s have another look at today\u2019s batch of UK data. Several bits of good news: living standards picked up, as companies spent more on wages and real household disposable incomes, adjusted for inflation, rose at the fastest rate in five years (3.7%). Companies\u2019 wage bills rose by 4.7% in real terms, the biggest rise since before the financial crisis (late 2007), although this is partly due to people working longer hours and extra pension payments, according to the Office for National Statistics. Thanks to a surge in exports, Britain\u2019s current account deficit with the rest of the world narrowed much more sharply than expected in the second quarter \u2013 to \u00a316.8bn from \u00a324bn in the first quarter \u2013 although this could be hard to sustain in light of the global economic slowdown. The deficit, which has been a worry for the Bank of England, dropped to a two-year low of 3.6% of GDP, after the UK\u2019s trade deficit shrank to the smallest since 1998. This is a welcome turnaround from last year, when Britain recorded its largest current account deficit on record at 5.1% of GDP, even though it was the fastest-growing G7 economy for a second year in a row. The prospects for the UK\u2019s economic recovery remain bright, judged Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics. Admittedly, the economic recovery does not look to have maintained this pace in Q3. Indeed, the CIPS/Markit composite PMI points to quarterly growth of a more modest 0.5%. However, we expect that the recovery will pick up pace again soon. After all, business and consumer confidence remains strong, credit is cheap and becoming more available, and households are yet to spend all of their windfall from lower energy and food prices. The upshot is that we remain upbeat about the prospects for the UK\u2019s economic recovery.\u201d The UK transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: The government\u2019s priority is to protect the public and I understand VW are contacting all UK customers affected. I have made clear to the Managing Director this needs to happen as soon as possible. The government expects VW to set out quickly the next steps it will take to correct the problem and support owners of these vehicles already purchased in the UK.\u201d The BBC have done \u201ca brief history\u201d of Volkswagen, with pics. You can read it here. In the wake of the VW emissions scandal, Consumers International, the federation for more than 240 consumer groups around the world, is calling on all global carmakers to come clean about in-car technology and its impact on emissions tests. They are also demanding an urgent review of emissions and fuel efficiency tests, and the introduction of stronger oversight of manufacturers testing, and independent testing where necessary. Amanda Long, director general of Consumers International, said: This scandal reflects long standing demands from many consumer organisations for more accurate testing of vehicles emissions and fuel efficiency and better oversight including independent testing where necessary. Regulators and manufacturers need to act urgently to restore consumers\u2019 confidence and trust in the car industry. Car manufacturers must step up and prove they have had no such similar breaches, and then spell out what they intend to do in the future to ensure they are meeting consumers expectations of openness and transparency. This crisis underlines the need to build stronger and more effective regulations and testing protocols that defend consumers\u2019 rights and stop unscrupulous companies from cheating the system.\u201d Time for a quick recap. 1) Deflation fears are stalking the eurozone again, after prices across the region fell for the first time since March. Eurostat reported that the eurozone Consumer Prices Index dipped by 0.1%, the first negative inflation reading since March. Economists aren\u2019t panicking, as the decline is mainly due to cheaper oil. But it could raise the chances of more aggressive stimulus measures from the European Central Bank soon. 2) World stock markets are about to post their worst quarterly performance since 2011. Almost $11tn has been wiped off shares worldwide, after three months dominated by growing concern over the global economy. European markets are rallying today: But FXTM chief market analyst, Jameel Ahmad remains cautious. There are just too many anxieties for investors right now with this including concerns over a complete lack of timing for a US interest rate hike, fears over China entering a deep economic downturn, continual growth concerns in both Europe and Japan alongside depressed commodity prices. The timely combination of all these factors together is exactly why I am refusing to believe that the overall market sentiment is going to transform into a positive one as we enter the final quarter of the year. 3) Volkswagen has announced that almost 1.2m cars in the UK contained software designed to evade emissions tests. Drivers will hear more soon.... 4) There\u2019s some relief in the UK after the current account deficit shrank; however, growth in 2014 has been trimmed a little too. Julia Kollewe will guide you through the afternoon.... It\u2019s been a rough quarter for metals prices as well as for shares. Gold has shed around 4% since July, to $1,122 per ounce, while platinum has shed 15% - its worst quarter since 2008. Hopes that Europe\u2019s jobless crisis is easing have taken a knock today. The eurozone unemployment rate came in at 11% in August, not the 10.9% expected. The Eurozone jobless rate in July has also been revised up to 11% from 10.9%, which is another disappointment. The lowest rates were recorded in Germany (4.5%), the Czech Republic (5.0%) and Malta (5.1%), and the highest in Greece (25.2% in June 2015) and Spain (22.2%). A reminder that Europe\u2019s weak inflation rate is part of a broader pattern: Here\u2019s a breakdown of the Volkswagen vehicles in the UK affected by the emissions scandal: Volkswagen Passenger Cars \u2013 508,276 Audi \u2013 393,450 SEAT \u2013 76,773 S\u030cKODA \u2013 131,569 Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles \u2013 79,838 They\u2019re all diesel models - VW says that its petrol cars are unaffected. Volkswagen says that the 1.1m UK drivers who own cars caught up in the emissions scandal will be contacted soon: In the coming days, the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) details of affected cars will be released to retailers. In addition, a self-serve process for customers to check if their vehicle is affected will be set up. Step by step, affected customers will be contacted, with details of a process to get their vehicles corrected in the near future. In the meantime, all vehicles are technically safe and roadworthy. The company is aiming to present a technical solution to the crisis to authorities next month. Breaking: Volkswagen has announced that over 1.1m cars designed to evade emissions testing were sold in the UK. One month\u2019s negative inflation isn\u2019t enough to spur the European Central Bank into its quantitative easing scheme. So argues Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services Group, adding: Despite the year-ago decline in headline inflation, this report does not meet the definition of deflation that ECB President Draghi has repeatedly cited this year: A self-perpetuating decline in prices that occurs across a wide range of goods and services. Today\u2019s inflation report is \u201cdisappointing news\u201d for the European Central Bank, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. A marked relapse in oil prices and very weak commodity prices first undermined and then reversed the upward trend in Eurozone consumer prices that had seen it move from deflation of 0.6% in January to inflation of 0.3% in May. Archer adds, though, that core inflation (stripping out energy and food) remained at +0.9%. It remains highly unlikely that Eurozone consumers will start to delay purchases in anticipation of falling prices; rather they are likely to continue to enjoy the boost to their purchasing power coming from mild deflation or low inflation. Mario Draghi must be disappointed that his \u20ac60bn-per-month bond-buying spree hasn\u2019t had a bigger impact. The ECB launched its QE programme in January after inflation sagged to minus -0.6%. It did then turn positive in May, but has been stubbornly weak since: ECB president Mario Draghi has already hinted that more stimulus measures could be needed to stimulate the eurozone; today\u2019s inflation data means that\u2019s more likely to happen. But I suspect the ECB won\u2019t be *too* alarmed that inflation has turned negative again, given that this is mainly due to cheap oil. Lower energy costs are, on balance, a good thing for the wider European economy - and could leave consumers with more cash to spend on other goods instead. This is the first time in six months that the eurozone has experienced negative inflation:. Here\u2019s the details from Eurostat: Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in September (1.4%, compared with 1.3% August), followed by services (1.3%, compared with 1.2% in August), non-energy industrial goods (0.3%, compared with 0.4% in August) and energy (-8.9%, compared with -7.2% in August). Here we go! Prices across the eurozone fell by 0.1% year-on-year this month, putting the single currency region back into negative inflation. As explained in the introduction, this may raise the chances of the ECB increasing its stimulus programme in the next few months. The weak oil price is the primary cause - energy prices fell by 8.9% year on year in September. Service sector and food prices did rise, though. Some reaction to the UK growth data: Phew. Britain\u2019s alarmingly wide current account deficit has narrowed. The gap between what the UK pays out to the rest of the world and what comes back in dropped to just 3.6% of GDP in the last quarter, down from 5.2% in January-March. That\u2019s still wider than economists would like, but it suggests the \u2018forgotten deficit\u2019 may be less of a threat to the recovery. Britain\u2019s Office for National Statistics has trimmed its estimate for UK growth last year. It now believes the economy expanded by 2.9% - healthy enough, but not the 3% previously eyed. The ONS also confirmed that UK GDP grew by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2015. That means the economy is 5.9% larger than its pre-crisis peak, driven by the service sector: City analyst Louise Cooper says emerging market fears helped to wipe $11 trillion off global markets this quarter: India is slowing, so much so the central bank cut rates earlier this week in a surprise move. China is slowing rapidly according to the data but its difficult to get a handle on exactly how much. Commodities prices are falling indicating this lack of demand. The emerging markets have been important contributors to global growth over the years since the crisis, contributing something like 60% to global growth. The question is whether the US, Europe and Japan can grow enough to make up for their weakness? And what impact an emerging market slow down will have on the rest of the world? These are unknowns. We don\u2019t even know how serious the slowdown. Andy Haldane of the Bank of England believes this is the third stage of the global crisis. But no one knows the answers to those questions yet. Thust markets are volatile and investors and traders nervous. In a note today Macquarie bank writes that the price of rough diamonds has fallen and sentiment is weak due to \u201cWeakness in global demand for jewellery and other luxury goods, in particular in emerging markets\u201d. If even diamond prices are falling, that says a lot about demand! There\u2019s better news from Italy. The jobless rate has dipped to its lowest level since February 2013, dropping to 11.9% in August from 12% in July. That\u2019s a good sign, ahead of the eurozone jobs data in 45 minutes. Is the shine coming off Germany\u2019s labour recovery? Data just released shows that Germany\u2019s unemployment total rose by 2,000 this month, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Economists had expected a drop of 5,000. That still leaves the German unemployment rate at a post-reunification low of 6.4%. This screengrab shows the scale of this summer\u2019s market rout: Like a schoolboy scribbling his homework on the bus, European traders are making a late attempt to improve their performance in the last quarter. Shares are rallying across Europe, as investors wonder whether this quarter\u2019s huge selloff has been overdone. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 103 points or 1.75%. Sainsbury\u2019s is leading the way after today\u2019s upbeat statement: Shares in Glencore have jumped by 7%, after it reiterated that it can ride out the commodity downturn. Glencore told the City that: Our business remains operationally and financially robust - we have positive cash flow, good liquidity and absolutely no solvency issues. The German DAX and French CAC are both up around 2.3%. Shares in Volkswagen are up almost 4%, after its new CEO promised to deliver a technical fix to remove the illicit software that allowed its cars to fool emissions testers. This won\u2019t make much of a dent in the huge losses incurred this quarter, though. Wowsers. Bloomberg has calculated that this summer\u2019s stock market rout has destroyed 11 trillion US dollars of value. They identify two key factors -- China\u2019s shock devaluation of the yuan in August, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to raise interest rates this month. Angus Nicholson of IG adds that German carmaker Volkswagen, and US presidential hopeful Hilary Clinton, also contributed to the selloff in the last 10 days: In the wake of the worldwide selloff in equities that began in August, global markets have been in a heightened state of sensitivity. Rarely does one see so many major event-driven selloffs in quick succession. Last week the VW emissions scandal prompted a major selloff in European markets, carmakers and related companies worldwide. Then Hilary Clinton, who had been planning to announce some new healthcare policies, jumped on the egregious price increase in a toxoplasmosis drug by new internet hate-target Martin Shkreli to decry the price of drugs in the US. This prompted a major selloff in healthcare and biotechnology stocks. Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi agrees that eurozone inflation could turn negative today, but doesn\u2019t expect the European Central bank to panic. Shares in supermarket chain J Sainsbury have surged by 11% after it told the City that it expects to beat profit forecasts this year. Total sales across the company rose by 0.3%, suggesting the company is riding out the price war raging in the sector. CEO Mike Coupe told investors that \u201cvolume and transactions grew\u201d, while the drop in average basket spend stabilised. My colleague Sean Farrell is on Sainsbury\u2019s conference call now, and grilling Coupe about staff wages: China\u2019s stock market has endured a torrid quarter. The Shanghai composite index just closed, having fallen 26% since the start of July after fears over the country\u2019s slowdown sparked panic selling during the summer. That, according to Reuters, is the worst quarter for Chinese shares since 2008. The north-south divide in house prices increased in the summer, as growth in London moved back into double figures, the UK\u2019s biggest building society reports. The latest monthly figures from Nationwide showed across the UK average prices rose by 0.5% in September, to a new high of \u00a3195,585. This brought the annual rate of growth to 3.8% - up from 3.2% in August. And in London, house prices jumped by 10.6% -- up from 7.3% in the previous quarter. That means the gap between London house prices and the rest of the UK was at its widest ever. At \u00a3443,399 the average price in the capital is more than three-and-a-half times the \u00a3124,345 paid in the north of England. After a summer of wild swings, world stock markets are about to post their worst quarterly performance since the dark days of the eurozone crisis. Fears over the global economy have hit equity values across the globe. Many of the main indices are facing double-digit losses since the start of July. As Barclays analysts explain: \u201cGlobal equities are closing in on their worst quarter since 2011, with a number of factors fueling fears in an already jittery market, including weak global growth, driven by deceleration in emerging markets, particularly China,\u201d With one day to go, the FTSE 100 is down over 9%, closely followed by the Dow Jones industrial average. European shares are down around 11%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei has shed 14%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re about to get a big clue about whether the European Central Bank will have to take new steps to stimulate the eurozone economy. New consumer pricing data, released at 10am BST, is expected to show that inflation across the eurozone has subsided back to zero, from 0.1% in August. But it could even turn negative -- as we already know that prices in Spain and Germany fell this month. If prices are deflating again, there will be even more pressure on the ECB to reach for a bigger bazooka and expand its bond-buying programme. Also coming up today.... The latest eurozone unemployment data is also released at 10am; that\u2019s expected to show the jobless rate stubbornly high, at 10.9%. In the UK, we get the final reading of second-quarter growth at 9.30am - probably confirming that GDP rose by 0.7%. The Office for National Statistics is also expected to revise its historical data, and could show that the economy performed better than expected. We\u2019ll also be watching Glencore; the mining and commodity firm is expected to meet with key bondholders today. In the corporate world, Sainsbury\u2019s are reporting financial results (they say they\u2019re on track to beat forecasts). Across in the eurozone, France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, is due to present the nation\u2019s budget this morning. And after two rough days trading, the markets are expected to rally at the open.",

The prime minister took the offshore financial centres to task on Wednesday during a trip to the Caribbean and said not enough progress was being made towards transparency. Over the past few years, Cameron has repeatedly urged territories such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands to introduce central public registers of company ownership, thereby allowing law enforcement agencies to trace criminals behind firms that are currently anonymous. This has met fierce resistance among some territories and Grant Shapps, a Foreign Office minister, appeared to backtrack on the UK\u2019s requests for a central register during a trip to the Cayman Islands over the summer. However, Cameron told the Jamaican parliament that he was still not happy with the way some territories were resisting financial transparency, without naming any. He said: \u201cIf we\u2019re to beat corruption, we need transparency.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Which vehicles are affected? Volkswagen Group has announced that 1.2m cars and commercial vehicles will be recalled in the UK as a result of the diesel engine emissions scandal. This includes: Volkswagen \u2013 508,276 Audi \u2013 393,450 Seat \u2013 76,773 \u0160koda \u2013 131,569 Volkswagen cars and other commercial vehicles \u2013 79,838 Which engines are involved? Anyone with a EA189 engine, which to most buyers means 1.2 litre, 1.6 litre and 2.0 litre diesel engines. The affected vehicles were sold between roughly 2009 and 2014. This include Golfs, Passats, \u0160koda Octavias and Fabias, plus a host of Audis. What about other models? All petrol models, as well as V6 TDI and V8 TDI diesel engined vehicles, are unaffected, VW has said. I have got one of those cars \u2013 what happens next? The VW Group is giving few details on how and when this will happen, except to say it is working behind the scenes on which owners need to be told. Recalls are managed by the government\u2019s Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency. VW will be contacting DVSA with a list of cars that are affected. DVSA then identifies each car\u2019s registered keeper and will write to them. It does so on VW\u2019s behalf because many of the affected cars will have been bought second hand, or are leased. When can I expect a letter? Again, VW isn\u2019t saying, but previously large recalls of this type have taken the DVSA six weeks to start producing letters. The agency has just managed a major recall of other cars prompted by air bag problems. In that instance, it took six weeks before the first letters were sent out. Expect the same now from VW. Is my car safe to drive in the meantime? Yes. VW says all the affected vehicles remain technically safe and roadworthy. It is only the car\u2019s emissions that are affected. What is the likely work, and how long will it take? VW remains tight-lipped. All it would say is that it aims to \u201cpresent technical solutions and measures to relevant responsible authorities\u201d before the end of October. The Guardian understands that vehicles will most likely require a software upgrade, in which case the car will only be off the road for a matter of hours. But if more serious work is required, it would likely to be at least a day, possibly longer. Given that 1.2m cars have been recalled across the group, this is likely to take many months \u2013 well into 2016 \u2013 to resolve. Will I get a replacement car while mine is being worked on? The Consumer group Which? says drivers should be entitled to one. However, the huge number of recalls may make that next to impossible \u2013 but if you need one, you should demand one. What will be the likely impact of the work? VW will desperately be hoping that the affected cars will continue to perform as drivers expect after the upgrade work is carried out. However, if the car performance, emissions or fuel consumption deteriorates substantially, lawyers will be queuing up to bring claims against the manufacturer. I\u2019ve just bought a new VW Group car. Is that affected? No. Cars with the latest Euro 6 engines \u2013 those typically bought in 2015 \u2013 are not thought to be affected.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Which vehicles are affected?</strong></p> <p>Volkswagen Group has announced that 1.2m cars and commercial vehicles <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/30/vw-emissions-scandal-12m-uk-cars-affected\">will be recalled in the UK</a> as a result of the diesel engine emissions scandal. </p> <p>This includes:</p> <p>Volkswagen \u2013 508,276</p> <p>Audi \u2013 393,450</p> <p>Seat \u2013 76,773</p> <p>\u0160koda \u2013 131,569</p> <p>Volkswagen cars and other commercial vehicles \u2013 79,838</p> <p><strong>Which engines are involved?</strong><br></p> <p>Anyone with a EA189 engine, which to most buyers means 1.2 litre, 1.6 litre and 2.0 litre diesel engines. The affected vehicles were sold between roughly 2009 and 2014. This include Golfs, Passats, \u0160koda Octavias and Fabias, plus a host of Audis. </p> <p><strong>What about other models?</strong><br></p> <p>All petrol models, as well as V6 TDI and V8 TDI diesel engined vehicles, are unaffected, VW has said.</p> <p><strong>I have got one of those cars \u2013 what happens next?</strong><strong><br></strong></p> <p>The VW Group is giving few details on how and when this will happen, except to say it is working behind the scenes on which owners need to be told. Recalls are managed by the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-standards-agency\">Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency</a>. VW will be contacting DVSA with a list of cars that are affected. DVSA then identifies each car\u2019s registered keeper and will write to them. It does so on VW\u2019s behalf because many of the affected cars will have been bought second hand, or are leased.</p> <p><strong>When can I expect a letter?</strong><strong><br></strong></p> <p>Again, VW isn\u2019t saying, but previously large recalls of this type have taken the DVSA six weeks to start producing letters. The agency has just managed a major recall of other cars prompted by air bag problems. In that instance, it took six weeks before the first letters were sent out. Expect the same now from VW.</p> <p><strong>Is my car safe to drive in the meantime?</strong><br></p> <p>Yes. VW says all the affected vehicles remain technically safe and roadworthy. It is only the car\u2019s emissions that are affected. </p> <p><strong>What is the likely work, and how long will it take?</strong><br></p> <p>VW <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/29/vw-owners-can-expect-recall-information-this-week\">remains tight-lipped</a>. All it would say is that it aims to \u201cpresent technical solutions and measures to relevant responsible authorities\u201d before the end of October. The Guardian understands that vehicles will most likely require a software upgrade, in which case the car will only be off the road for a matter of hours. But if more serious work is required, it would likely to be at least a day, possibly longer. Given that 1.2m cars have been recalled across the group, this is likely to take many months \u2013 well into 2016 \u2013 to resolve.</p> <p><strong>Will I get a replacement car while mine is being worked on?</strong><br></p> <p>The Consumer group Which? says drivers should be entitled to one. However, the huge number of recalls may make that next to impossible \u2013 but if you need one, you should demand one. </p> <p><strong>What will be the likely impact of the work?</strong><br></p> <p>VW will desperately be hoping that the affected cars will continue to perform as drivers expect after the upgrade work is carried out. However, if the car performance, emissions or fuel consumption deteriorates substantially, lawyers will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/27/vw-uk-diesel-vehicles-affected-lawyers\">queuing up to bring claims</a> against the manufacturer. </p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve just bought a new VW Group car. Is that affected?</strong><br></p> <p>No. Cars with the latest Euro 6 engines \u2013 those typically bought in 2015 \u2013 are not thought to be affected.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Global markets have suffered their worst quarterly performance since the depths of the eurozone crisis in 2011, with an estimated $11tn (\u00a37tn) wiped off the value of world shares, despite an attempted rebound on the last day of September. After a summer of wild swings, sparked by growing fears of a slowdown in China, leading shares have slumped from the record highs of a few months earlier, and recorded their second quarterly decline in a row. The MSCI all-country world index, which monitors 23 developed and 23 emerging markets, has fallen nearly 11.5% since 30 June, marking its poorest quarterly outcome since the three months to September 2011. The FTSE 100 index, which hit a record high of 7,103 in April, fell below 6,000 during the quarter and is down 7% over the three months despite a 152-point bounce on Wednesday to a close of 6,061. Since the end of June, the UK\u2019s leading index has seen \u00a3117bn wiped off its value. Again, this is its worst performance since the three months to September 2011 when it fell 13.7%. The poorest performer among global markets is the Shanghai composite index, down 26% since the start of July and suffering its worst quarter since 2008. Elsewhere, the FTSE emerging markets index is down more than 19% over the quarter, Germany\u2019s Dax is down nearly 12%, and in the US the Dow Jones industrial average and S&amp;P 500 have dropped nearly 8%. The rout began in earnest in early August, when China tried to boost its flagging economy with the biggest one-day devaluation of the country\u2019s currency, the yuan, in 20 years. The move was followed by further reductions in the yen\u2019s value and sent shockwaves through markets, with investors fearing the country\u2019s rapid economic growth was running out of steam. Commodity prices slumped on concerns about slowing demand, with mining companies which had invested heavily facing the prospect of falling sales at the same time as they had run up significant debt. The commodity trader and mining group Glencore was a major victim of these worries, losing 40% of its value in the last month alone. At the same time, the prospect of a rise in US interest rates has been coming closer despite the concerns about China and global growth. Emerging markets, which had been boosted by the cheap money pumped out by the central banks, the US Federal Reserve in particular, came under intense pressure, with the International Monetary Fund warning on Tuesday that rising rates could see a new credit crisis when borrowing costs rose. Other factors hitting shares included the Volkswagen scandal, with the carmaker\u2019s admission it had cheated on diesel emissions tests sending motor manufacturers\u2019 shares sharply lower on the basis the whole industry could come under intense scrutiny. And this month\u2019s comments from the US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton that she would clamp down on pharmaceutical costs \u2013 after the New York firm Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a drug used by Aids patients by a staggering 5,000% \u2013 hit shares in drug companies. So despite a bounce on Wednesday, prompted partly by hopes of further quantitative easing from the European Central Bank after the eurozone fell back into deflation, markets remain volatile. The latest Chinese purchasing managers index on Thursday and the US non-farm payrolls on Friday are likely to prompt further uncertainty. Michael Hewson, the chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said recent market falls had usually prompted investors to return to equities before too long in search of a bargain, sending shares higher once more. But, he said, this time may be different: \u201cGiven the volatility seen in the past couple of months there is a feeling that something may have changed with the slow slide in commodity prices since the peaks of 2011 starting to sow some significant seeds of concern about where the next catalyst for a move higher will come from. \u201cWhen commodity prices bottomed in 2008, the combined effects of a Chinese stimulus programme and US quantitative easing saw a swift about-turn in prices in a matter of months. It\u2019s hard to see something similar happening now with oil and mining companies taking a scalpel to capital expenditure in large chunks.\u201d Hewson added: \u201cFurthermore, investors are having to contend with a US Federal Reserve looking to tighten policy and not loosen it, raising concerns about the debt profiles of a good part of the basic resource sector, at a time when revenues are likely to remain under pressure due to low prices. \u201cWhile commodity prices may rise eventually there still remains a great deal of excess capacity in the mining and oil and gas sector, which still needs to be worked through. It is against this backdrop that investors are voting with their feet and reverting to cash and other safer havens.\u201d Even some of those havens have been under pressure, with gold recording its worst quarterly loss in a year as investors worried about the cost of holding the metal, which is priced in dollars, when a US rate rise could be on the way.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has revealed that almost 1.2m vehicles in the UK are involved in the diesel emissions scandal that has rocked the carmaker, meaning more than one in 10 diesel cars on the country\u2019s roads are affected. VW said the diesel vehicles include 508,276 Volkswagen cars, 393,450 Audis, 76,773 Seats, 131,569 \u0160kodas and 79,838 Volkswagen commercial vehicles. The total number of vehicles affected is 1,189,906. This is the first time VW has admitted how many of the 11m vehicles fitted with a defeat device to cheat emissions tests are in the UK. The admission means that the UK is one of the countries worst affected by the scandal and will increase the pressure on the government to launch a full investigation. Figures from the Department for Transport show that there were 10.7m diesel cars on Britain\u2019s roads at the end of 2014 and that an estimated 5.3m of the petrol and diesel cars are Volkswagens or one of the groups\u2019 sister brands. Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s priority is to protect the public and I understand VW are contacting all UK customers affected. I have made clear to the managing director this needs to happen as soon as possible. \u201cThe government expects VW to set out quickly the next steps it will take to correct the problem and support owners of these vehicles already purchased in the UK.\u201d VW said 2.8m vehicles in Germany are involved, while 482,000 cars have been recalled in the US. The company intends to set up a \u201cself-serve process\u201d that will allow UK motorists to find out if their vehicle is affected. Dealers will also be sent the vehicle identification numbers of those involved. Affected customers will be contacted about visiting a mechanic to have their cars refitted. The cars fitted with a defeat device have EA 189 EU5 engines. However, VW is yet to reveal the full details of the recall plan, which will need to be approved by regulators. The carmaker said: \u201cIn the meantime, all vehicles are technically safe and roadworthy. Volkswagen Group UK is committed to supporting its customers and its retailers through the coming weeks.\u201d VW has set aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to cover the cost of the crisis, so motorists will not have to pay for the refit. However, Leigh Day, the law firm, said it had written to the new chief executive of VW, Matthias M\u00fcller, to ask that it refund UK consumers the premium they paid for their \u201cclean\u201d diesel cars, as well as compensation for other losses. The letter said the fitting of defeat devices in VW vehicles \u201cundoubtedly amounts to a misrepresentation and a breach of contract\u201d and demanded a meeting with the company\u2019s bosses. Leigh Day said it was investigating legal claims on behalf of hundreds of vehicle owners and companies with fleets of cars. Bozena Michalowska Howells, part of the consumer law and product safety group at Leigh Day, wrote in the letter: \u201cWhile we welcome the news that repairs will be undertaken to upgrade the affected cars to comply with EU nitrogen dioxide emission standards, such repairs may result in reduced fuel efficiency and increased CO2 emissions which in turn may impact upon the vehicle excise duty payable and other associated costs. \u201cOur clients are also very concerned about the impact of the use of defeat devices on the resale value of their cars.\u201d",

Despite a strong recovery by the Australian stock market after Tuesday\u2019s heavy losses, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s says China\u2019s trading partners must adjust to the Asian giant\u2019s slowing economy with commodity suppliers such as Australia hardest hit. \u201cWith China\u2019s slowing growth, Australia is a clear \u2018loser\u2019, reflecting its commodity-intensive export basket and strong trade links with the country,\u201d S&amp;P\u2019s Asia-Pacific chief economist, Paul Gruenwald, says in a report released on Wednesday. \u201cWhat was a blessing before is now a curse.\u201d Australian shares recouped some of Tuesday\u2019s near 4% loss \u2013 or around $60bn in market value \u2013 after the UK-listed mining-cum-trading company Glencore reassured investors that it would be able to withstand falling commodity prices. At the close on Wednesday, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index was up 103.2 points, or 2.1%, at 5,021.6 points. The Australian dollar followed shares upwards and was buying US70.05 cents at 5.30pm on Wednesday. Other markets across Asia Pacific also fared better but concerns lingered over slumping commodities prices and China\u2019s cooling economy. European markets were set to follow Asia higher, with financial spreadbetters expecting Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC 40 to open as much as 1.2% higher. US stock futures rose 0.8%, suggesting a stronger opening on Wall Street later in the session. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.6% after plumbing its lowest since June 2012 on Tuesday on fears that China\u2019s slowdown would curb its huge appetite for commodities and resources. The index was on track for a 2.9% decline in September, extending losses for the quarter to 17.7%, its worst quarterly performance in four years. Japan\u2019s Nikkei brushed aside an unexpected drop in the country\u2019s industrial output to close up 2.7%, paring losses for the quarter to 14.1%, its deepest since 2010. \u201cThe current environment represents a winding back of the overly bullish expectations of both commodity demand and Chinese growth \u2013 to a more balanced expectation of progressive, not exponential, growth,\u201d said Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management in Sydney. He said the impact from China was not just limited to Asia-Pacific but also Latin America and in particular Chile. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund said the weak commodity price outlook could subtract one percentage point annually from economic growth in commodity exporting countries like Australia over the next two years. Growth in Australia slowed to just 2% at the end of the June quarter, well below its long-term average of 3.25%. Other commodity-based countries such as Canada and Brazil are already in recession.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s shares soared as the supermarket said it would rake in higher-than-expected profits after sales at its big stores stabilised and it cut the cost of food thrown away. The shares jumped more than 13% as investors seized on a rare piece of encouraging news from Britain\u2019s battered supermarket sector. Shares in Tesco and Morrisons were also lifted amid hopes that shoppers are finally putting more items in their baskets after more than a year of price cuts. Sales at Sainsbury\u2019s stores open at least a year were still down \u2013 by 1.1% excluding the impact of fuel sales \u2013 in the 16 weeks to 26 September, but that was a marked improvement from the 2.1% decline seen in the previous quarter. Sainsbury\u2019s online sales rose 15% and clothing sales rose by 13%. The company said that the number of customer transactions and the volume of goods sold had both increased during the period. That came after Sainsbury\u2019s improved the quality of 3,000 products, including selling riper avocados and lowering the sugar content in its own-brand yogurt. \u201cWith a bit more disposable income in customers\u2019 pockets we can be slightly more optimistic,\u201d said Mike Coupe, chief executive. Sales over the summer were better than expected as, Coupe said, there were signs of stabilisation at large stores, which have taken the brunt of sales falls as shoppers favour small neighbourhood outlets. Coupe said there had also been a \u201cpause for breath\u201d in the pace of price cuts across the grocery market over the summer. Grocery prices fell by between 1.5% and 2% compared to 2.5% in the previous quarter. He added that Sainsbury\u2019s had been able to cut more costs than anticipated. Reducing the number of its promotions in favour of generally lower prices helped it predict demand more accurately and cut the amount of food wasted in its stores. \u201c[In the] year to date we have traded well, with both sales and cost savings ahead of expectations. Should current market trends continue, we expect our full year underlying profit before tax to be moderately ahead of our published consensus,\u201d Coupe said. At least one analyst \u2013 Clive Black at Shore Capital \u2013 upgraded his profit expectation by 5.3% to \u00a3575m. \u201cSainsbury has surprised us, and we sense the market,\u201d Black said. Analysts\u2019 average forecast for the year that ends in March is for pre-tax profit to fall to \u00a3548m from last year\u2019s \u00a3681m. Coupe warned that prices would continue to fall and Sainsbury\u2019s had already invested more than \u00a3150m in lowering prices. \u201cThis is a challenging market and I don\u2019t think there is anything currently in the wind that suggests that will get any easier over the next period of time,\u201d Coupe said. Industry figures last week showed Sainsbury\u2019s was the only one of the big-four grocers to increase sales in the past three months. All of the UK\u2019s major grocers \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 are struggling to cope with rapidly changing shopping habits as shoppers switch to online stores, neighbourhood shops and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Profits are also under pressure from wage increases after the chancellor announced a \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 \u2013 effectively a new minimum wage for over-25s \u2013 rising to about \u00a39 by 2020. Sainsbury\u2019s said it was in no rush to match basic pay rises for shopfloor staff announced by Morrisons and Lidl in the past week. This month, Sainsbury\u2019s increased its standard rate for shopfloor staff by 4% to \u00a37.36 an hour. That figure has been overtaken by Lidl and Morrisons, which have both announced a basic rate of \u00a38.20 \u2013 closer to the rate recommended by the Living Wage Foundation. Coupe said his staff are paid for breaks and that the company paid \u00a350m in bonuses last year so that, including perks, his staff took home about the same amount as Morrisons and Lidl staff under their latest pay deal. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smoke and mirrors in this. If you stand back and look at what we pay colleagues on average over a year, then it is pretty much the same as Morrisons and Lidl ... Last year, we paid a \u00a350m bonus to colleagues \u2013 that\u2019s larger than the pay rise for Morrisons.\u201d Coupe added that Sainsbury\u2019s will talk to staff about reorganising pay so they will earn more than the chancellor\u2019s planned rate, and will at some time probably overtake the living wage as defined by the Living Wage Foundation. Sainsbury\u2019s shares closed up 31p at 261p, taking the shares above their 247p price at the start of the year for the first time. Tesco shares rose almost 5% and Morrisons\u2019 were up more than 6%.",

All of the UK\u2019s major grocers \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 are struggling to cope with rapidly changing shopping habits as shoppers switch to online stores, neighbourhood shops and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Profits are also under pressure from wage increases after the chancellor announced a \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 \u2013 effectively a new minimum wage for over-25s \u2013 rising to about \u00a39 by 2020.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s said it was in no rush to match basic pay rises for shopfloor staff announced by Morrisons and Lidl in the past week. </p> <p>This month, Sainsbury\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/27/sainsburys-shopfloor-staff-pay-rise\">increased its standard rate for shopfloor staff</a> by 4% to \u00a37.36 an hour. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/29/morrisons-supermarket-shop-floor-staff-national-living-wage-george-osborne\">That figure has been overtaken by Lidl and Morrisons</a>, which have both announced a basic rate of \u00a38.20 \u2013 closer to the rate recommended by the Living Wage Foundation.<br></p> <p>Coupe said his staff are paid for breaks and that the company paid \u00a350m in bonuses last year so that, including perks, his staff took home about the same amount as Morrisons and Lidl staff under their latest pay deal. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smoke and mirrors in this. If you stand back and look at what we pay colleagues on average over a year, then it is pretty much the same as Morrisons and Lidl ... Last year, we paid a \u00a350m bonus to colleagues \u2013 that\u2019s larger than the pay rise for Morrisons.\u201d</p> <p>Coupe added that Sainsbury\u2019s will talk to staff about reorganising pay so they will earn more than the chancellor\u2019s planned rate, and will at some time probably overtake the living wage as defined by the Living Wage Foundation.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s shares closed up 31p at 261p, taking the shares above their 247p price at the start of the year for the first time. Tesco shares rose almost 5% and Morrisons\u2019 were up more than 6%.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

      "bodyText": "The ideologically driven \u201csize of government\u201d issue is emerging as a critical political and policy battlefield. This is caused by demographic changes and the electorate\u2019s insistence the government provide decent services that are underpinning what appears to be a structural lift in government spending. If this is the case and the budget is ever to get to surplus, policies that raise revenue to pay for these services will be needed. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, claimed last week the budget \u201cproblem\u201d (to the extent there is one) was one of excess spending not inadequate revenue. Morrison offered little intellectual evidence for this other than citing obsolete data that spending to gross domestic product (GDP) was above average at 26%. Amid the political upheaval of the last few weeks, the release of the final budget outcome for 2014-15 has received scant attention \u2013 even, it seems, from Morrison. What coverage there was centred on the fact the budget deficit in 2014-15 was $37.9bn. This was $3bn below the budget estimate in May but $14bn above the level estimated in the pre election fiscal outlook prepared prior to the 2013 election and based on the policy settings of the previous Labor government. The final budget outcome documents also revealed that government spending, at 25.6% of GDP in 2014-15, was a touch below the 25.7% of GDP in 2013-14, but for the first time since the mid-1990s, there had been two consecutive years where spending to GDP had been above 25.5%. Government revenue is growing steadily, in line with the ongoing growth in the economy. It has lifted from 21.5% of GDP in 2010-11 to 23.5% in 2014-15. One critical issue on the debate on tax and spending as the 2016 election looms large, is whether revenue growth is being sustained into 2015-16 and then into the budget forward estimates beyond that. The answer to this will not be confirmed until Morrison reveals the forecasts (out to 2018-19) in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) in November or December. With the economy still growing, the unemployment rate no higher than Treasury was forecasting in the May budget and commodity prices in Australian dollar terms higher than assumed, the path towards a smaller deficit and eventual surplus is likely to be confirmed in the Myefo, via higher revenue. Revenue is likely to be around the long-term average at 24.5% of GDP within three years. That the budget is likely to be in deficit in the out-years is because government spending will be above average and perhaps reflecting a structural rise. These facts raise some vitally important policy issues, that in recent years, were lost in the blather and economic trash-talk of the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, and his treasurer, Joe Hockey. The sensible question is whether the size of government is increasing and needs to increase further due to structural and demographic trends. Is government spending and revenue around 25% of GDP simply too low? Australians are living longer, getting access to higher quality health care and there is a vital need to enhance the education system to maintain Australia\u2019s global skills ranking. These items have a high concentration of government funding and participation \u2013 pensions, Medicare and education. This government involvement is because of the policy thrust of progressive governments over several decades towards fairness, equity, decency and opportunity for all. The bulk of the population wants to see these quality of life issues supported and enhanced by government. To be sure, they are expensive which in itself suggests there could be an increase in the size of government if the electorate is to get its way. There is, of course, nothing sacrosanct about government spending and revenue, each being anchored around 25% of GDP as they have been for the past few decades. Indeed, in the 1960s, government spending and revenue were well under 20% of GDP. With the structural social policy reforms in the 1970s \u2013 focused on education, healthcare and pensions \u2013 the size of government rose to the current norm around 25% of GDP and it has been held around that level by both sides of politics over that time. It is possible, if not likely, the electorate will demand the government fund a significant proportion of the cost of health, ageing and education. If so, Morrison is wrong and government spending will remain higher than the historical average and the issue of returning the budget to surplus will all be about revenue \u2013 tax in other words. Any discussion of tax cuts \u2013 income or company taxes \u2013 would be erroneous and ideologically driven. Using ongoing economic growth to cover the cost of the structural increase in spending and then move to surplus as revenue flows to the Treasury coffers is appropriate and desirable, as would consideration of other measures to underpin a lift in revenue. It would be a mistake for the government to contemplate reducing the tax take until it can be sure that the revenue will not be needed to fund the demographic and structural changes in the economy. Either that or the government will need to make sure people pay more for their healthcare, education and retirement from their own pockets and in this way, the size of government will be smaller. It is an interesting ideological debate that is only just hotting up. Stephen Koukoulas is a Research Fellow at Per Capita, a progressive think tank.",

The World Economic Forum thinktank, which hosts the gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss ski resort of Davos each January, said that Britain has slipped one place to rank as the 10th most competitive economy in the world, with Switzerland and Singapore topping the table. The WEF assesses the world\u2019s economies across more than 100 different indicators, from the quality of infrastructure to the flexibility of labour markets. Margareta Drzeniek-Hanouz, the WEF\u2019s lead economist, said both Sweden and the UK had made progress over the past twelve months. But Sweden\u2019s improvement had been more significant, particularly in business sophistication: the extent to which firms use the latest techniques, in marketing for example. The WEF argued that the UK\u2019s weaknesses include the fragile state of the public finances and the difficulty for firms of obtaining loans \u2014 a common complaint from business lobby groups. \u201cWhere the country falls short is in its macroeconomic environment, where government debt and the budget deficit conspire to place it 108th out of 140 countries. It could do better, too, with the quality of its education system (21st) and maths and science in particular (46th) \u2013 both long-term problems,\u201d it said. However, the WEF praised the UK\u2019s strong scientific research base, the quality of collaboration between businesses and universities, and its openness to the rest of the global economy. In the emerging world, the WEF\u2019s analysts praised India, where Narendra Modi\u2019s government has carried out a series of reforms to liberalise the country\u2019s economy, helping it to stage a \u201cspectacular\u201d 16-place jump up the rankings, to 55th. It also issued a warning about the health of the global economy, saying \u201ca \u2018new normal\u2019 of suppressed economic and productivity growth and persistently high unemployment is damaging resilience and leaving the world vulnerable to another protracted slump\u201d. It called on countries to \u201cstep up their efforts to re-accelerate economic growth\u201d. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show that the UK remains one of the top 10 best places in the world to start and grow a business. Our economy is growing faster than any other G7 nation and we are the top destination for inward investment in Europe.

      "bodyText": "Ask people where they were on 9/11, and most have a memory to share. Ask where they were when Lehman Brothers collapsed, and many will struggle even to remember the correct year. The 158-year-old Wall Street bank filed for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008. As the news broke, insiders experienced an atmosphere of unprecedented panic. One former investment banker recalled: \u201cI thought: so this is what the threat of war must feel like. I remember looking out of the window and seeing the buses drive by. People everywhere going through a normal working day \u2013 or so they thought. I realised: they have no idea. I called my father from the office to tell him to transfer all his savings to a safer bank. Going home that day, I was genuinely terrified.\u201d A veteran at a small credit rating agency who spent his whole career in the City of London told me with genuine emotion: \u201cIt was terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. We came so close to a global meltdown.\u201d He had been on holiday in the week Lehman went bust. \u201cI remember opening up the paper every day and going: \u2018Oh my God.\u2019 I was on my BlackBerry following events. Confusion, embarrassment, incredulity ... I went through the whole gamut of human emotions. At some point my wife threatened to throw my BlackBerry in the lake if I didn\u2019t stop reading on my phone. I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d Other financial workers in the City, who were at their desks after Lehman defaulted, described colleagues sitting frozen before their screens, paralysed \u2013 unable to act even when there was easy money to be made. Things were looking so bad, they said, that some got on the phone to their families: \u201cGet as much money from the ATM as you can.\u201d \u201cRush to the supermarket to hoard food.\u201d \u201cBuy gold.\u201d \u201cGet everything ready to evacuate the kids to the country.\u201d As they recalled those days, there was often a note of shame in their voices, as if they felt humiliated by the memory of their vulnerability. Even some of the most macho traders became visibly uncomfortable. One said to me in a grim voice: \u201cThat was scary, mate. I mean, not film scary. Really scary.\u201d I spent two years, from 2011 to 2013, interviewing about 200 bankers and financial workers as part of an investigation into banking culture in the City of London after the crash. Not everyone I spoke to had been so terrified in the days and weeks after Lehman collapsed. But the ones who had phoned their families in panic explained to me that what they were afraid of was the domino effect. The collapse of a global megabank such as Lehman could cause the financial system to come to a halt, seize up and then implode. Not only would this mean that we could no longer withdraw our money from banks, it would also mean that lines of credit would stop. As the fund manager George Cooper put it in his book The Origin of Financial Crises: \u201cThis financial crisis came perilously close to causing a systemic failure of the global financial system. Had this occurred, global trade would have ceased to function within a very short period of time.\u201d Remember that this is the age of just-in-time inventory management, Cooper added \u2013 meaning supermarkets have very small stocks. With impeccable understatement, he said: \u201cIt is sobering to contemplate the consequences of interrupting food supplies to the world\u2019s major cities for even a few days.\u201d These were the dominos threatening to fall in 2008. The next tile would be hundreds of millions of people worldwide all learning at the same time that they had lost access to their bank accounts and that supplies to their supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations had frozen. The TV images that have come to define this whole episode \u2013 defeated-looking Lehman employees carrying boxes of their belongings through Wall Street \u2013 have become objects of satire. As if it were only a matter of a few hundred overpaid people losing their jobs: Look at the Masters of the Universe now, brought down to our level! In reality, those cardboard box-carrying bankers were the beginning of what could very well have been a genuine breakdown of society. Although we did not quite fall off the edge after the crash in the way some bankers were anticipating, the painful effects are still being felt in almost every sector. At this distance, however, seven years on, it\u2019s hard to see what has changed. And if nothing has changed, it could all happen again. * * * A typical education in the west leaves you with more insight into ancient Rome or Egypt than into our financial system \u2013 and while there are plenty of books and DVDs for lay people about, say, quantum mechanics, evolution or the human genome, before the crash there was virtually nothing to explain finance to outsiders in accessible language. The City, as John Lanchester put it in his book about the 2008 crash, Whoops!, is still \u201ca far-off country of which we know little\u201d. As a result, ordinary people trying to form an opinion about finance over the past decades have had very little to go on, and many seem to have latched on to the images provided by films and TV. The British stereotype of the boring banker began to change in the 80s when finance was deregulated. Following Ronald Reagan\u2019s dictum, \u201cGovernment is not the solution to the problem, it is the problem\u201d, banks were allowed to unite under one roof activities that regulation had previously required to be divided between separate firms and banks. They were able to grow to sizes many times bigger than a country\u2019s GDP \u2013 the assumption being that the market would be self-regulating. The changes also meant that bankers became immensely powerful. Hollywood provided the City with a new hero: the financier Gordon Gekko, from Oliver Stone\u2019s 1987 film Wall Street, who brought us the phrase \u201cGreed is good\u201d. In his portrait of bond traders\u2019 raging ambition, Bonfire of the Vanities, novelist Tom Wolfe coined the term \u201cMasters of the Universe\u201d. It all seemed innocent entertainment, before 2008: tales about a far-off country where boys behaved badly, scandalously even, but above all, reassuringly far away from the comfort and safety of our own homes, something like watching a Quentin Tarantino film or an episode of The Sopranos. This was the era when a Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, could give a speech to a gathering of bankers and asset managers and tell them: \u201cThe financial services sector in Britain, and the City of London at the centre of it, is a great example of a highly skilled, high value-added, talent-driven industry that shows how we can excel in a world of global competition. Britain needs more of the vigour, ingenuity and aspiration that you already demonstrate that is the hallmark of your success.\u201d Those words were spoken in 2007, and a year later the world found itself in the middle of the biggest financial panic since the 1930s. In the end, it was only through a combination of pure luck, extremely expensive nationalisations and bailouts, the lowest interest rates in recorded history plus an ongoing experiment in mass money printing, that total meltdown was averted. The post-Lehman panic was followed by a wave of investigations and reconstructions by journalists, writers and politicians. More than 300 books have been published about the crash in English alone. Every western country held extensive hearings and produced detailed recommendations. Everything you need to know about what is wrong with finance and the banks today is in their reports; the problem is that there is so much more that needs to be explained. Most areas inside banking had little or nothing to do with the crash, while many players outside banking bore a heavy responsibility, too, including insurers, credit rating agencies, accountancy firms, financial law firms, central banks, regulators and politicians. Investors such as pension funds had been egging the banks on to make more profits by taking more risk. Unless you had a firm understanding of finance, the causes of the crash were very unclear, and this must be part of the reason why the clearest and most urgent lesson of all would get lost or buried: the financial system itself had become dangerously flawed. After the crash of 2008, ignorance among the general public, reticence among complicit mainstream politicians and a deeply skewed and sensationalist portrayal of finance in the mass media conspired to create the narrative that the crash was caused by greed or by some other character flaw in individual bankers: psychopathy, gambling addiction or cocaine use. (A whole genre of City memoirs sprang up with titles such as Binge Trading: The Real Inside Story of Cash, Cocaine and Corruption in the City. Gordon Gekko returned for a sequel, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, and Leonardo di Caprio scored an immense hit playing the title role in The Wolf of Wall Street, about a whoring and cocaine-snorting financial fraudster.) From there it was a small step to the notion that we can fix finance by getting rid of the \u201cjerks\u201d, as the plain speaking former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond put it. When Diamond was forced to resign in July 2012 over a scandal involving interest rate rigging by his traders, his successor, Antony Jenkins, also promised to focus on changing the culture. And so the same banks that brought us the mess of 2008 eagerly embraced the need for cultural change \u2013 which alone should arouse our suspicions. If there is one recurring theme in the many conversations I had with City insiders, it was the need for structural rather than cultural change; not so much different bankers, but a different system. \u201cSometimes I feel as if finance has reacted to the crisis the way a motorist might after a near-accident,\u201d said the City veteran at a small credit rating agency whose wife had almost chucked his phone into a lake at the height of the panic. \u201cThere is the adrenaline surge directly after the lucky escape, followed by the huge shock when you realise what could have happened. But as the journey continues and the scene recedes in the rear-view mirror, you tell yourself: maybe it wasn\u2019t that bad. The memory of your panic fades, and you even begin to misremember what happened. Was it really that bad?\u201d He was a soft-spoken man, the sort to send a text message if he is going to be five minutes late to a meeting. But now he was really angry: \u201cIf you had told people at the height of the crisis that years later we\u2019d have had no fundamental changes, nobody would have believed you. Such was the panic and fear. But here we are. It\u2019s back to business as usual. We went from \u2018We nearly died from this\u2019 to \u2018We survived this\u2019.\u201d * * * The City is governed by a code of silence and fear of publicity; those caught talking to the press without a PR officer present could be sacked or sued. But once I had persuaded City insiders to talk (always and only on condition of anonymity), they were remarkably forthcoming. \u201cI have the wrong accent and I went to a shit school,\u201d said one City veteran, after explaining that for many years he had made millions at a top bank only to move to an even better-paying hedge fund. \u201cForty years ago, I wouldn\u2019t even have been given an interview in the City. Finance today is fiercely meritocratic. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re gay or black or working class, if you can do something better than the other person, you\u2019ll move up.\u201d He was a mathematician by training, and his direct manner reminded me of stallholders at the biggest open market in my hometown of Amsterdam \u2013 tough guys with a highly developed mistrust of pretentiousness. He fuelled himself with Diet Coke and coffee and teased me for ordering cranberry juice. Before he was recruited by the bank in the early 1990s, he had taught at a university; his only idea of an investment bank was based on two books he had read: Liar\u2019s Poker by Michael Lewis and Barbarians at the Gate by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. \u201cTraders as loud, crass, bad-mouthed, macho dickheads. The sort of guys with red braces who shout \u2018buy, buy, sell, sell\u2019 into their phones and have eating competitions.\u201d Many outsiders still believe that these are the people occupying the top positions in big banks, he said, and taking the biggest risks. \u201cThat\u2019s over,\u201d he told me. \u201cSome of the best traders are now women. Totally unassuming, cerebral and talented. Trading is no longer a balls job. It\u2019s a brains job. To be sure, the kind of maths traders now have to be able to do is not of the wildly hard variety. But it requires real skills in that area.\u201d He described the basic flaw in the banking system as it has evolved over the past decades: other people\u2019s money. Until deregulation began to liberate finance from the constraints placed on it after the last major crash in the 1930s, risky banking in the City was carried out in firms that were organised as partnerships, which were not listed on the stock exchange. The partners owned and ran the firm \u2013 and when things went wrong, they were liable. Hence the system of bonuses: if you put your personal fortune on the line and things go well, it stands to reason that you deserve a big bonus. Because if things go the other way, you are personally liable for the losses. Back in the days when his bank was still a partnership, the former banker had drawn on his gift for maths to build a complex financial product that he thought was very clever. \u201cI was very new and maybe a bit cocky,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I went over to the head of trading and showed it to him, saying, \u2018Look, we can make a lot of money with this.\u2019 The head of trading was a partner in the traditional sense. He looked at me and replied: \u2018Don\u2019t forget, this is my money you\u2019re fucking with.\u2019\u201d The problem with the way banks are now organised is not that they take risks \u2013 that is their job. The problem with today\u2019s banks is that those who accept the risks are no longer those who get stuck with the bill. A bank that is listed on the stock market loses control to the new owners; that is, the shareholders. When these shareholders, which can include insurers, wealthy dynasties or pension funds, start demanding ever greater profits, then greater profits are what you have to deliver. In 2007, in an inadvertent moment of candour, the then CEO of the megabank Citigroup, Charles O Prince, summarised this relationship: \u201cAs long as the music is playing, you\u2019ve got to get up and dance.\u201d This dynamic became all the more dangerous as globalisation began to create a single market for finance. Not only were partnerships allowed to be listed on the stock exchange or taken over by a publicly listed bank, they were also allowed to go on a global shopping spree. Wave after wave of mergers and acquisitions meant banks could generate higher profits than the GDPs of their host countries, resulting in the institutions that we now know as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d \u2013 so big that if they go bust, they can bring down the system with them. When excessive risk turns sour, it\u2019s the taxpayer who suffers. In a functioning free market system, incompetence and recklessness are punished by failure and bankruptcy. But there is currently no functioning free market at the centre of the global free market system. I heard City workers scoff at the employees of banks that cannot be allowed to fail \u2013 calling them overpaid civil servants who play a game they cannot lose. Risk-taking at a bank that will always be saved, they said, is like playing Russian roulette with someone else\u2019s head. In the old days, veterans told me, there was an office party almost every Friday: celebrating the anniversary of someone who had stayed with the firm for 20 years or longer. That is all over now, and in its place has come a hire-and-fire culture characterised by an absence of loyalty on either side. Employment in the City is now a purely transactional affair. It is exceedingly rare to find people who have stayed with the same bank for their entire career. Many of the insiders I spoke to had stories about abrupt sackings: You get a call from a colleague, saying: \u201cLook, could you do me a favour and get my coat and bag?\u201d She is standing outside with a blocked security pass. One morning, you swipe your pass only to hear a beep and find your entrance barred. You turn to the receptionist who says, after a glance at her computer screen, \u201cWould you please have a seat over there until somebody comes to fetch you?\u201d In the City, sudden dismissals of this kind have a name: \u201cexecutions\u201d. Add to these the quarterly \u201cwaves\u201d when headquarters decides to reduce headcount and a certain percentage of staff worldwide are given the sack, all on one day. Some banks operate a \u201ccull\u201d. Every year, prestigious banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan routinely fire their least profitable staff. \u201cWhen the cull comes ...\u201d people would say, or: \u201cOh yes, we cull.\u201d \u201cWhen you can be out of the door in five minutes, your horizon becomes five minutes,\u201d one City worker told me. Another asked: \u201cWhy would I treat my bank any better than my bank treats me?\u201d If the threat of being culled influenced bankers\u2019 behaviour through fear, there were also powerful motivations. Deregulation has allowed perverse incentives into the very fabric of global finance. People are faced with immense temptations to take risks with their bank\u2019s capital or reputation, knowing that if they don\u2019t act on them, their colleague across the desk will. Before the deregulation of the 80s and 90s, the City was far from perfect: it was a snobbish, antisemitic and misogynistic place. But the City \u2013 and Wall Street \u2013 of old was a world that Gus Levy, head of Goldman Sachs in the 70s, famously described as \u201clong term greedy\u201d; you made money with your client and your firm. Because partners were personally liable, they had an interest in keeping their firm on a manageable scale and making sure their employees told them of any risks. In a few decades, this system has evolved into one that Levy called \u201cshort term greedy\u201d; you make money at the expense of the client, of the bank, of the shareholder or of the taxpayer. This did not happen because bankers suddenly became evil, but because the incentives fundamentally changed. Until the mid 80s, the London Stock Exchange\u2019s motto was dictum meum pactum, \u201cmy word is my bond\u201d. These days the governing principle is caveat emptor, or \u201cbuyer beware\u201d \u2013 it is effectively up to the professional investor to figure out what the bank is offering. As one builder of complex financial products explained to me: \u201cYou have got to read the small print. You need to bring in a lawyer who explains it to you before you buy these things.\u201d * * * Perhaps the most terrifying interview of all the 200 I recorded was with a senior regulator. It was not only what he said but how he said it: as if the status quo was simply unassailable. Ultimately, he explained, regulators \u2013 the government agencies that ensure the financial sector is safe and compliant \u2013 rely on self-declaration; what is presented by a bank\u2019s internal management. The trouble, he said with a calm smile, is that a bank\u2019s internal management often doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on because banks today are so vast and complex. He did not think he had ever been deliberately lied to, although he acknowledged that, obviously, he couldn\u2019t know for sure. \u201cThe real threat is not a bank\u2019s management hiding things from us, it\u2019s the management not knowing themselves what the risks are.\u201d He talked about the culture of fear and how people are not managing their actions for the benefit of their bank. Instead, \u201cthey are managing their career\u201d. He believed that the crash had been more \u201ccock-up than conspiracy\u201d. Bank management is in conflict, he pointed out: \u201cWhat is good for the long term of the bank or the country may not be what is best for their own short-term career or bonus.\u201d If the problem with finance is perverse incentives, then the insistence on greed as the cause for the crash is part of the problem. There is a lot of greed in the City, as there is elsewhere in society. But if you blame the crash on character flaws in individuals you imply that the system itself is fine, all we need to do is to smoke out the crooks, the gambling addicts, the coke-snorters, the sexists, the psychopaths. Human beings always have at least some scope for choice, hence the differences in culture between banks. Still, human behaviour is largely determined by incentives, and in the current set-up, these are sending individual bankers, desks or divisions within banks \u2013 as well as the banks themselves \u2013 in the wrong direction. How hard would it be to change those incentives? From the viewpoint of those I interviewed, not hard at all. First of all, banks could be chopped up into units that can safely go bust \u2013 meaning they could never blackmail us again. Banks should not have multiple activities going on under one roof with inherent conflicts of interest. Banks should not be allowed to build, sell or own overly complex financial products \u2013 clients should be able to comprehend what they buy and investors understand the balance sheet. Finally, the penalty should land on the same head as the bonus, meaning nobody should have more reason to lie awake at night worrying over the risks to the bank\u2019s capital or reputation than the bankers themselves. You might expect all major political parties to have come out by now with their vision of a stable and productive financial sector. But this is not what has happened. Not that there has been no reform. Banks are taxed when they get beyond a certain size, for example, and all banks must now finance a larger part of their risks with equity rather than borrowed money. American banks are banned from using their own capital to speculate and invest in the markets, and the European commission, or national governments, have forced a few banks to shrink or sell off their investment bank activities \u2013 the Dutch bank ING, for example, was told to sell off its insurance arm, Nationale Nederlanden. But change has been largely cosmetic, leaving the sector\u2019s basic architecture intact. If a bank collapses, the new European banking union \u2013 set up in 2012 to transfer banking policy from a national to a European level \u2013 is meant to step in and wind it down in an orderly fashion. But who is propping up that European banking union, if several banks should fail at the same time? The taxpayer. A bonus cap in banking was introduced by the EU, so instead of paying widely publicised million-pound bonuses, banks now simply offer higher salaries. Perhaps the most promising change in the UK is the so-called \u201csenior person regime\u201d that makes it possible to prosecute bankers for reckless behaviour \u2013 but only after they have wrecked their bank. Virtually all big banks remain publicly listed or are doing everything they can to get back on the stock exchange. They have never allowed staff to talk openly about what went wrong before 2008 and why. The code of silence remains intact. The banks have not sacked the accountancy firms or credit rating agencies that failed to raise the alarm over the erroneous or misleading items on their balance sheets. Banks have certainly not joined hands to fight for a globally enforced increase in capital buffers (the minimum capital they are required to hold), which could help them absorb and survive severe losses. Indeed, they have spent millions lobbying to keep any increase in buffers as low as possible. \u201cBack to business as usual.\u201d This is how many interviewees described the post-crash atmosphere in the City. As the senior regulator put it with chilling equanimity: \u201cIs the sector fixed, after the crisis? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d What we have now, he added, is \u201cwhat you get with free-market capitalism \u2013 consolidation of all wealth into fewer and fewer banks, which end up dividing up the market as a cartel.\u201d * * * When it comes to global finance, the most startling news isn\u2019t news at all; the important facts have been known for a long time among insiders. The problem goes much deeper: the sector has become immune to exposure. \u201cIf I had a million pounds for every time I have heard a possible reform opposed because \u2018it wouldn\u2019t have prevented Northern Rock or Lehman Brothers going bust\u2019, I might now have enough money to bail out a bank,\u201d the Financial Times columnist John Kay wrote in 2013. \u201cThe objective of reform is not to prevent Northern Rock or Lehman going bust ... The problem revealed by the 2007-08 crisis was not that some financial services companies collapsed, but that there was no means of handling their failure without endangering the entire global financial system.\u201d Only last year Andrew Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, told the German magazine Der Spiegel that the balances of the big banks are \u201cthe blackest of black holes\u201d. Haldane is responsible for the stability of the financial sector as a whole. He knowingly told a journalist that he couldn\u2019t possibly have an idea of what the banks have on their books. And? Nothing happened. It made sense in 2008 for those in the know not to deepen the panic by talking about it. Indeed, one of the most powerful figures in the EU in 2008, the almost supernaturally levelheaded Herman van Rompuy, waited until 2014 to acknowledge in an interview that he had seen the system come within \u201ca few millimetres of total implosion\u201d. But because the general public was left in the dark, there was never enough political capital to take on the banks. Compare this to the 1930s in the US, when the crash was allowed to play out, giving Franklin D Roosevelt the chance to bring in simple and strong new laws that kept the financial sector healthy for many decades \u2013 until Reagan and Thatcher undid one part, and Clinton and Blair the other. Tony Blair is now making a reported \u00a32.5m a year as adviser to JP Morgan, while the former US Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner and the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton have been paid upwards of $100,000 a speech to address small audiences at global banks. It is tempting to see corruption in all this, but it seems more likely that, over the past decades, politicians as well as regulators have come to identify themselves with the financial sector they are supposed to be regulating. The term here is \u201ccognitive capture\u201d, a concept popularised by the economist and former Financial Times columnist Willem Buiter, who described it as over-identification between the regulator and the regulated \u2013 or \u201cexcess sensitivity of the Fed to financial market and financial sector concerns and fears\u201d. With corruption, you are given money to do something you would not have done otherwise. Capture is more subtle and no longer requires a transfer of funds \u2013 since the politician, academic or regulator has started to believe that the world works in the way that bankers say it does. Sadly, Willem Buiter never wrote a definitive account of capture; he no longer works in academia and journalism. He has moved to the megabank Citigroup. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, memorably said in 2013 that European politicians know very well what needs to be done to save the economy. They just don\u2019t know how to get elected after doing it. A similar point could be made about the major parties in this country: they know very well what needs to be done to make finance safe again. They just don\u2019t know where their campaign donations and second careers are going to come from once they have done it. Still, the complicity of mainstream politicians is not the whole story. Finance today is global, while democratically legitimate politics operates on a national level. Banks can play off one country or block of countries against the other, threatening to pack up and leave if a piece of regulation should be introduced that doesn\u2019t agree with them. And they do, shamelessly. \u201cOK, let us assume our country takes on its financial sector,\u201d a mainstream European politician told me. \u201cIn that case, our banks and financial firms simply move elsewhere, meaning we will have lost our voice in international forums. Meanwhile, globally, nothing has changed.\u201d This then opens up the most difficult question of all: how is the global financial sector to be brought back under control if there is no global political authority capable of challenging it? Seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it is often said that nothing was learned from the crash. This is too optimistic. The big banks have surely drawn a lesson from the crash and its aftermath: that in the end there is very little they will not get away with.

      "body": "<p>Ask people where they were on 9/11, and most have a memory to share. Ask where they were when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/20/lehman-brothers-crash-2008-photograph\">Lehman Brothers collapsed</a>, and many will struggle even to remember the correct year. The 158-year-old Wall Street bank filed for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008. As the news broke, insiders experienced an atmosphere of unprecedented panic. One former investment banker recalled: \u201cI thought: so this is what the threat of war must feel like. I remember looking out of the window and seeing the buses drive by. People everywhere going through a normal working day \u2013 or so they thought. I realised: they have no idea. I called my father from the office to tell him to transfer all his savings to a safer bank. Going home that day, I was genuinely terrified.\u201d</p> <p>A veteran at a small credit rating agency who spent his whole career in the City of London told me with genuine emotion: \u201cIt was terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. We came so close to a global meltdown.\u201d He had been on holiday in the week Lehman went bust. \u201cI remember opening up the paper every day and going: \u2018Oh my God.\u2019 I was on my BlackBerry following events. Confusion, embarrassment, incredulity ... I went through the whole gamut of human emotions. At some point my wife threatened to throw my BlackBerry in the lake if I didn\u2019t stop reading on my phone. I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d</p> <p>Other financial workers in the City, who were at their desks after Lehman defaulted, described colleagues sitting frozen before their screens, paralysed \u2013 unable to act even when there was easy money to be made. Things were looking so bad, they said, that some got on the phone to their families: \u201cGet as much money from the ATM as you can.\u201d \u201cRush to the supermarket to hoard food.\u201d \u201cBuy gold.\u201d \u201cGet everything ready to evacuate the kids to the country.\u201d As they recalled those days, there was often a note of shame in their voices, as if they felt humiliated by the memory of their vulnerability. Even some of the most macho traders became visibly uncomfortable. One said to me in a grim voice: \u201cThat was scary, mate. I mean, not film scary. Really scary.\u201d<br></p> <p>I spent two years, from 2011 to 2013, interviewing about 200 bankers and financial workers as part of an investigation into banking culture in the City of London after the crash. Not everyone I spoke to had been so terrified in the days and weeks after Lehman collapsed. But the ones who had phoned their families in panic explained to me that what they were afraid of was the domino effect. The collapse of a global megabank such as Lehman could cause the financial system to come to a halt, seize up and then implode. Not only would this mean that we could no longer withdraw our money from banks, it would also mean that lines of credit would stop. As the fund manager <a href=\"http://georgecooper.org/\">George Cooper</a> put it in his book The Origin of Financial Crises: \u201cThis financial crisis came perilously close to causing a systemic failure of the global financial system. Had this occurred, global trade would have ceased to function within a very short period of time.\u201d Remember that this is the age of just-in-time inventory management, Cooper added \u2013 meaning supermarkets have very small stocks. With impeccable understatement, he said: \u201cIt is sobering to contemplate the consequences of interrupting food supplies to the world\u2019s major cities for even a few days.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"361b5a33a085da87d62d466e5a341306f0566ea6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/29/1443539208611/3c52ab4c-fb1c-4144-ad01-31742dcfe443-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"illustration test\" width=\"450\" height=\"351\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>These were the dominos threatening to fall in 2008. The next tile would be hundreds of millions of people worldwide all learning at the same time that they had lost access to their bank accounts and that supplies to their supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations had frozen. The TV images that have come to define this whole episode \u2013 defeated-looking Lehman employees carrying boxes of their belongings through Wall Street \u2013 have become objects of satire. As if it were only a matter of a few hundred overpaid people losing their jobs: <em>Look at the Masters of the Universe now, brought down to our level!</em></p> <p>In reality, those cardboard box-carrying bankers were the beginning of what could very well have been a genuine breakdown of society. Although we did not quite fall off the edge after the crash in the way some bankers were anticipating, the painful effects are still being felt in almost every sector. At this distance, however, seven years on, it\u2019s hard to see what has changed.</p> <p>And if nothing has changed, it could all happen again.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>A typical education in the west</strong> leaves you with more insight into ancient Rome or Egypt than into our financial system \u2013 and while there are plenty of books and DVDs for lay people about, say, quantum mechanics, evolution or the human genome, before the crash there was virtually nothing to explain finance to outsiders in accessible language. The City, as John Lanchester put it in his book about the 2008 crash, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/whoops-john-lanchester-howard-davies\">Whoops!</a>, is still \u201ca far-off country of which we know little\u201d.</p> <p>As a result, ordinary people trying to form an opinion about finance over the past decades have had very little to go on, and many seem to have latched on to the images provided by films and TV.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">Sign up to the long read email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The British stereotype of the boring banker began to change in the 80s when finance was deregulated. Following Ronald Reagan\u2019s dictum, \u201cGovernment is not the solution to the problem, it <em>is</em> the problem\u201d, banks were allowed to unite under one roof activities that regulation had previously required to be divided between separate firms and banks. They were able to grow to sizes many times bigger than a country\u2019s GDP \u2013 the assumption being that the market would be self-regulating. The changes also meant that bankers became immensely powerful. Hollywood provided the City with a new hero: the financier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/12/wall-street-gordon-gekko-greed\">Gordon Gekko</a>, from Oliver Stone\u2019s 1987 film Wall Street, who brought us the phrase \u201cGreed is good\u201d. In his portrait of bond traders\u2019 raging ambition, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/10/bonfire-of-vanities-tom-wolfe\">Bonfire of the Vanities</a>, novelist Tom Wolfe coined the term \u201cMasters of the Universe\u201d.</p> <p>It all seemed innocent entertainment, before 2008: tales about a far-off country where boys behaved badly, scandalously even, but above all, reassuringly far away from the comfort and safety of our own homes, something like watching a Quentin Tarantino film or an episode of The Sopranos. This was the era when a Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, could give a speech to a gathering of bankers and asset managers and tell them: \u201cThe financial services sector in Britain, and the City of London at the centre of it, is a great example of a highly skilled, high value-added, talent-driven industry that shows how we can excel in a world of global competition. Britain needs more of the vigour, ingenuity and aspiration that you already demonstrate that is the hallmark of your success.\u201d</p> <p>Those words were spoken in 2007, and a year later the world found itself in the middle of the biggest financial panic since the 1930s. In the end, it was only through a combination of pure luck, extremely expensive nationalisations and bailouts, the lowest interest rates in recorded history plus an ongoing experiment in mass money printing, that total meltdown was averted.</p> <p>The post-Lehman panic was followed by a wave of investigations and reconstructions by journalists, writers and politicians. More than 300 books have been published about the crash in English alone. Every western country held extensive hearings and produced detailed recommendations. Everything you need to know about what is wrong with finance and the banks today is in their reports; the problem is that there is so much more that needs to be explained.</p> <p>Most areas inside banking had little or nothing to do with the crash, while many players outside banking bore a heavy responsibility, too, including insurers, credit rating agencies, accountancy firms, financial law firms, central banks, regulators and politicians. Investors such as pension funds had been egging the banks on to make more profits by taking more risk. Unless you had a firm understanding of finance, the causes of the crash were very unclear, and this must be part of the reason why the clearest and most urgent lesson of all would get lost or buried: the financial system itself had become dangerously flawed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s back to business as usual. We went from 'We nearly died from this'  to 'We survived this.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After the crash of 2008, ignorance among the general public, reticence among complicit mainstream politicians and a deeply skewed and sensationalist portrayal of finance in the mass media conspired to create the narrative that the crash was caused by greed or by some other character flaw in individual bankers: psychopathy, gambling addiction or cocaine use. (A whole genre of City memoirs sprang up with titles such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/13/binge-trading-seth-freedman\">Binge Trading: The Real Inside Story of Cash, Cocaine and Corruption in the City</a>. Gordon Gekko returned for a sequel, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, and Leonardo di Caprio scored an immense hit playing the title role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/16/wolf-of-wall-street-review\">The Wolf of Wall Street</a>, about a whoring and cocaine-snorting financial fraudster.)</p> <p>From there it was a small step to the notion that we can fix finance by getting rid of the \u201cjerks\u201d, as the plain speaking former Barclays CEO <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/10/barclays-boss-no-jerks-rule\">Bob Diamond put it</a>. When Diamond was forced to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/03/bob-diamond-resigns-barclays\">resign</a> in July 2012 over a scandal involving interest rate rigging by his traders, his successor, Antony Jenkins, also promised to focus on changing the culture. And so the same banks that brought us the mess of 2008 eagerly embraced the need for cultural change \u2013 which alone should arouse our suspicions. If there is one recurring theme in the many conversations I had with City insiders, it was the need for structural rather than cultural change; not so much different bankers, but a different system.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I feel as if finance has reacted to the crisis the way a motorist might after a near-accident,\u201d said the City veteran at a small credit rating agency whose wife had almost chucked his phone into a lake at the height of the panic. \u201cThere is the adrenaline surge directly after the lucky escape, followed by the huge shock when you realise what could have happened. But as the journey continues and the scene recedes in the rear-view mirror, you tell yourself: maybe it wasn\u2019t that bad. The memory of your panic fades, and you even begin to misremember what happened. Was it really that bad?\u201d</p> <p>He was a soft-spoken man, the sort to send a text message if he is going to be five minutes late to a meeting. But now he was really angry: \u201cIf you had told people at the height of the crisis that years later we\u2019d have had no fundamental changes, nobody would have believed you. Such was the panic and fear. But here we are. It\u2019s back to business as usual. We went from \u2018We nearly died from this\u2019 to \u2018We survived this\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The City is governed by a code</strong> of silence and fear of publicity; those caught talking to the press without a PR officer present could be sacked or sued. But once I had persuaded City insiders to talk (always and only on condition of anonymity), they were remarkably forthcoming.</p> <p>\u201cI have the wrong accent and I went to a shit school,\u201d said one City veteran, after explaining that for many years he had made millions at a top bank only to move to an even better-paying hedge fund. \u201cForty years ago, I wouldn\u2019t even have been given an interview in the City. Finance today is fiercely meritocratic. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re gay or black or working class, if you can do something better than the other person, you\u2019ll move up.\u201d</p> <p>He was a mathematician by training, and his direct manner reminded me of stallholders at the biggest open market in my hometown of Amsterdam \u2013 tough guys with a highly developed mistrust of pretentiousness. He fuelled himself with Diet Coke and coffee and teased me for ordering cranberry juice. Before he was recruited by the bank in the early 1990s, he had taught at a university; his only idea of an investment bank was based on two books he had read: Liar\u2019s Poker by Michael Lewis and Barbarians at the Gate by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. \u201cTraders as loud, crass, bad-mouthed, macho dickheads. The sort of guys with red braces who shout \u2018buy, buy, sell, sell\u2019 into their phones and have eating competitions.\u201d Many outsiders still believe that these are the people occupying the top positions in big banks, he said, and taking the biggest risks. \u201cThat\u2019s over,\u201d he told me. \u201cSome of the best traders are now women. Totally unassuming, cerebral and talented. Trading is no longer a balls job. It\u2019s a brains job. To be sure, the kind of maths traders now have to be able to do is not of the wildly hard variety. But it requires real skills in that area.\u201d</p> <p>He described the basic flaw in the banking system as it has evolved over the past decades: other people\u2019s money. Until deregulation began to liberate finance from the constraints placed on it after the last major crash in the 1930s, risky banking in the City was carried out in firms that were organised as partnerships, which were not listed on the stock exchange. The partners owned and ran the firm \u2013 and when things went wrong, they were liable. Hence the system of bonuses: if you put your personal fortune on the line and things go well, it stands to reason that you deserve a big bonus. Because if things go the other way, you are personally liable for the losses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c2c4466a82ccdef9d7465c3a1fa0f761b092de0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2c4466a82ccdef9d7465c3a1fa0f761b092de0b/0_0_600_739/406.jpg\" alt=\"Building\" width=\"406\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Back in the days when his bank was still a partnership, the former banker had drawn on his gift for maths to build a complex financial product that he thought was very clever. \u201cI was very new and maybe a bit cocky,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I went over to the head of trading and showed it to him, saying, \u2018Look, we can make a lot of money with this.\u2019 The head of trading was a partner in the traditional sense. He looked at me and replied: \u2018Don\u2019t forget, this is my money you\u2019re fucking with.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The problem with the way banks are now organised is not that they take risks \u2013 that is their job. The problem with today\u2019s banks is that those who accept the risks are no longer those who get stuck with the bill.</p> <p>A bank that is listed on the stock market loses control to the new owners; that is, the shareholders. When these shareholders, which can include insurers, wealthy dynasties or pension funds, start demanding ever greater profits, then greater profits are what you have to deliver. In 2007, in an inadvertent moment of candour, the then CEO of the megabank Citigroup, Charles O Prince, summarised this relationship: \u201cAs long as the music is playing, you\u2019ve got to get up and dance.\u201d</p> <p>This dynamic became all the more dangerous as globalisation began to create a single market for finance. Not only were partnerships allowed to be listed on the stock exchange or taken over by a publicly listed bank, they were also allowed to go on a global shopping spree. Wave after wave of mergers and acquisitions meant banks could generate higher profits than the GDPs of their host countries, resulting in the institutions that we now know as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d \u2013 so big that if they go bust, they can bring down the system with them. When excessive risk turns sour, it\u2019s the taxpayer who suffers.</p> <p>In a functioning free market system, incompetence and recklessness are punished by failure and bankruptcy. But there is currently no functioning free market at the centre of the global free market system. I heard City workers scoff at the employees of banks that cannot be allowed to fail \u2013 calling them overpaid civil servants who play a game they cannot lose. Risk-taking at a bank that will always be saved, they said, is like playing Russian roulette with someone else\u2019s head.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem with today\u2019s banks is that those who accept the risks are no longer those who get stuck with the bill</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the old days, veterans told me, there was an office party almost every Friday: celebrating the anniversary of someone who had stayed with the firm for 20 years or longer. That is all over now, and in its place has come a hire-and-fire culture characterised by an absence of loyalty on either side. Employment in the City is now a purely transactional affair. It is exceedingly rare to find people who have stayed with the same bank for their entire career.</p> <p>Many of the insiders I spoke to had stories about abrupt sackings: You get a call from a colleague, saying: \u201cLook, could you do me a favour and get my coat and bag?\u201d She is standing outside with a blocked security pass. One morning, you swipe your pass only to hear a beep and find your entrance barred. You turn to the receptionist who says, after a glance at her computer screen, \u201cWould you please have a seat over there until somebody comes to fetch you?\u201d</p> <p>In the City, sudden dismissals of this kind have a name: \u201cexecutions\u201d. Add to these the quarterly \u201cwaves\u201d when headquarters decides to reduce headcount and a certain percentage of staff worldwide are given the sack, all on one day. Some banks operate a \u201ccull\u201d. Every year, prestigious banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan routinely fire their least profitable staff. \u201cWhen the cull comes ...\u201d people would say, or: \u201cOh yes, we cull.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you can be out of the door in five minutes, your horizon becomes five minutes,\u201d one City worker told me. Another asked: \u201cWhy would I treat my bank any better than my bank treats me?\u201d</p> <p>If the threat of being culled influenced bankers\u2019 behaviour through fear, there were also powerful motivations. Deregulation has allowed perverse incentives into the very fabric of global finance. People are faced with immense temptations to take risks with their bank\u2019s capital or reputation, knowing that if they don\u2019t act on them, their colleague across the desk will.</p> <p>Before the deregulation of the 80s and 90s, the City was far from perfect: it was a snobbish, antisemitic and misogynistic place. But the City \u2013 and Wall Street \u2013 of old was a world that Gus Levy, head of Goldman Sachs in the 70s, famously described as \u201clong term greedy\u201d; you made money with your client and your firm. Because partners were personally liable, they had an interest in keeping their firm on a manageable scale and making sure their employees told them of any risks. In a few decades, this system has evolved into one that Levy called \u201cshort term greedy\u201d; you make money at the expense of the client, of the bank, of the shareholder or of the taxpayer. This did not happen because bankers suddenly became evil, but because the incentives fundamentally changed.</p> <p>Until the mid 80s, the London Stock Exchange\u2019s motto was <em>dictum meum pactum</em>, \u201cmy word is my bond\u201d. These days the governing principle is <em>caveat emptor</em>, or \u201cbuyer beware\u201d \u2013 it is effectively up to the professional investor to figure out what the bank is offering. As one builder of complex financial products explained to me: \u201cYou have got to read the small print. You need to bring in a lawyer who explains it to you before you buy these things.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Perhaps the most terrifying interview</strong> of all the 200 I recorded was with a senior regulator. It was not only what he said but how he said it: as if the status quo was simply unassailable. Ultimately, he explained, regulators \u2013 the government agencies that ensure the financial sector is safe and compliant \u2013 rely on self-declaration; what is presented by a bank\u2019s internal management. The trouble, he said with a calm smile, is that a bank\u2019s internal management often doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on because banks today are so vast and complex. He did not think he had ever been deliberately lied to, although he acknowledged that, obviously, he couldn\u2019t know for sure. \u201cThe real threat is not a bank\u2019s management hiding things from us, it\u2019s the management not knowing themselves what the risks are.\u201d</p> <p>He talked about the culture of fear and how people are not managing their actions for the benefit of their bank. Instead, \u201cthey are managing their career\u201d. He believed that the crash had been more \u201ccock-up than conspiracy\u201d. Bank management is in conflict, he pointed out: \u201cWhat is good for the long term of the bank or the country may not be what is best for their own short-term career or bonus.\u201d</p> <p>If the problem with finance is perverse incentives, then the insistence on greed as the cause for the crash is part of the problem. There is a lot of greed in the City, as there is elsewhere in society. But if you blame the crash on character flaws in individuals you imply that the system itself is fine, all we need to do is to smoke out the crooks, the gambling addicts, the coke-snorters, the sexists, the psychopaths. Human beings always have at least some scope for choice, hence the differences in culture between banks. Still, human behaviour is largely determined by incentives, and in the current set-up, these are sending individual bankers, desks or divisions within banks \u2013 as well as the banks themselves \u2013 in the wrong direction.</p> <p>How hard would it be to change those incentives? From the viewpoint of those I interviewed, not hard at all. First of all, banks could be chopped up into units that can safely go bust \u2013 meaning they could never blackmail us again. Banks should not have multiple activities going on under one roof with inherent conflicts of interest. Banks should not be allowed to build, sell or own overly complex financial products \u2013 clients should be able to comprehend what they buy and investors understand the balance sheet. Finally, the penalty should land on the same head as the bonus, meaning nobody should have more reason to lie awake at night worrying over the risks to the bank\u2019s capital or reputation than the bankers themselves. You might expect all major political parties to have come out by now with their vision of a stable and productive financial sector. But this is not what has happened.</p> <p>Not that there has been no reform. Banks are taxed when they get beyond a certain size, for example, and all banks must now finance a larger part of their risks with equity rather than borrowed money. American banks are banned from using their own capital to speculate and invest in the markets, and the European commission, or national governments, have forced a few banks to shrink or sell off their investment bank activities \u2013 the Dutch bank ING, for example, was told to sell off its insurance arm, Nationale Nederlanden. But change has been largely cosmetic, leaving the sector\u2019s basic architecture intact. If a bank collapses, the new European banking union \u2013 set up in 2012 to transfer banking policy from a national to a European level \u2013 is meant to step in and wind it down in an orderly fashion. But who is propping up that European banking union, if several banks should fail at the same time? The taxpayer. A bonus cap in banking was introduced by the EU, so instead of paying widely publicised million-pound bonuses, banks now simply offer higher salaries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you blame the crash on character flaws in individuals you imply that the system itself is fine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the most promising change in the UK is the so-called \u201csenior person regime\u201d that makes it possible to prosecute bankers for reckless behaviour \u2013 but only after they have wrecked their bank. Virtually all big banks remain publicly listed or are doing everything they can to get back on the stock exchange. They have never allowed staff to talk openly about what went wrong before 2008 and why. The code of silence remains intact. The banks have not sacked the accountancy firms or credit rating agencies that failed to raise the alarm over the erroneous or misleading items on their balance sheets. Banks have certainly not joined hands to fight for a globally enforced increase in capital buffers (the minimum capital they are required to hold), which could help them absorb and survive severe losses. Indeed, they have spent millions lobbying to keep any increase in buffers as low as possible.</p> <p>\u201cBack to business as usual.\u201d This is how many interviewees described the post-crash atmosphere in the City. As the senior regulator put it with chilling equanimity: \u201cIs the sector fixed, after the crisis? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d What we have now, he added, is \u201cwhat you get with free-market capitalism \u2013 consolidation of all wealth into fewer and fewer banks, which end up dividing up the market as a cartel.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>When it comes to global finance,</strong> the most startling news isn\u2019t news at all; the important facts have been known for a long time among insiders. The problem goes much deeper: the sector has become immune to exposure.</p> <p>\u201cIf I had a million pounds for every time I have heard a possible reform opposed because \u2018it wouldn\u2019t have prevented Northern Rock or Lehman Brothers going bust\u2019, I might now have enough money to bail out a bank,\u201d the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/91c3f47c-3a5b-11e3-9243-00144feab7de.html\">Financial Times columnist John Kay wrote in 2013</a>. \u201cThe objective of reform is not to prevent Northern Rock or Lehman going bust ... The problem revealed by the 2007-08 crisis was not that some financial services companies collapsed, but that there was no means of handling their failure without endangering the entire global financial system.\u201d</p> <p>Only last year Andrew Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, told the German magazine Der Spiegel that the balances of the big banks are \u201cthe blackest of black holes\u201d. Haldane is responsible for the stability of the financial sector as a whole. He knowingly told a journalist that he couldn\u2019t possibly have an idea of what the banks have on their books. And? Nothing happened.</p> <p>It made sense in 2008 for those in the know not to deepen the panic by talking about it. Indeed, one of the most powerful figures in the EU in 2008, the almost supernaturally levelheaded Herman van Rompuy, waited until 2014 to acknowledge in an interview that he had seen the system come within \u201ca few millimetres of total implosion\u201d.</p> <p>But because the general public was left in the dark, there was never enough political capital to take on the banks. Compare this to the 1930s in the US, when the crash was allowed to play out, giving Franklin D Roosevelt the chance to bring in simple and strong new laws that kept the financial sector healthy for many decades \u2013 until Reagan and Thatcher undid one part, and Clinton and Blair the other.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"015d47631905eea4b95ea0c18a5b420a6eebeb72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/015d47631905eea4b95ea0c18a5b420a6eebeb72/0_0_600_547/500.jpg\" alt=\"Globe Illustration\" width=\"500\" height=\"456\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Tony Blair is now making a reported \u00a32.5m a year as adviser to JP Morgan, while the former US Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner and the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton have been paid upwards of $100,000 a speech to address small audiences at global banks. It is tempting to see corruption in all this, but it seems more likely that, over the past decades, politicians as well as regulators have come to identify themselves with the financial sector they are supposed to be regulating. The term here is \u201ccognitive capture\u201d, a concept popularised by the economist and former Financial Times columnist Willem Buiter, who described it as over-identification between the regulator and the regulated \u2013 or \u201cexcess sensitivity of the Fed to financial market and financial sector concerns and fears\u201d.</p> <p>With corruption, you are given money to do something you would not have done otherwise. Capture is more subtle and no longer requires a transfer of funds \u2013 since the politician, academic or regulator has started to believe that the world works in the way that bankers say it does. Sadly, Willem Buiter never wrote a definitive account of capture; he no longer works in academia and journalism. He has moved to the megabank Citigroup.</p> <p>The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, memorably said in 2013 that European politicians know very well what needs to be done to save the economy. They just don\u2019t know how to get elected after doing it. A similar point could be made about the major parties in this country: they know very well what needs to be done to make finance safe again. They just don\u2019t know where their campaign donations and second careers are going to come from once they have done it.</p> <p>Still, the complicity of mainstream politicians is not the whole story. Finance today is global, while democratically legitimate politics operates on a national level. Banks can play off one country or block of countries against the other, threatening to pack up and leave if a piece of regulation should be introduced that doesn\u2019t agree with them. And they do, shamelessly. \u201cOK, let us assume our country takes on its financial sector,\u201d a mainstream European politician told me. \u201cIn that case, our banks and financial firms simply move elsewhere, meaning we will have lost our voice in international forums. Meanwhile, globally, nothing has changed.\u201d</p> <p>This then opens up the most difficult question of all: how is the global financial sector to be brought back under control if there is no global political authority capable of challenging it?</p> <p>Seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it is often said that nothing was learned from the crash. This is too optimistic. The big banks have surely drawn a lesson from the crash and its aftermath: that in the end there is very little they will not get away with.</p> <p><em>Illustrations by S\u00e9bastien Thibault</em></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/297220/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Swimming With Sharks</em></a><em> by Joris Luyendijk (Guardian Faber, \u00a312.99).
