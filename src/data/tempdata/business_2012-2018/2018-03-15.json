      "bodyText": "Men are paid two and a half times more per hour than women on average at banking group HSBC, the largest gender pay gap reported to date by a major UK company. The gender pay report from the UK\u2019s largest bank, published on Thursday, reveals that less than a quarter of its most senior staff are female, while more than two-thirds of those in junior roles are women. That disparity means HSBC Bank\u2019s pay gap is 59%, according to the mean average measure, which is calculated by taking all male and female wages and dividing them by the number of workers. The group gives a provisional mean pay gap of 60% for 2018. The gender pay gap refers to the difference in hourly earnings between men and women working for an organisation regardless of their roles, rather than men and women in the same role. Under a new government scheme, all companies with more than 250 employees must report their pay gap under an initiative designed to reveal the greater prevalence of men in top-paying jobs and encourage action for change. HSBC said that it had increased the proportion of senior posts held by women to nearly 27% last year from 22% in 2012, but added: \u201cWe recognise that that there is more work to do to address our gender balance at senior levels.\u201d The median gap, which takes the mid-point when all wage rates are lined up from the biggest to smallest as a way to reduce the impact of one-off outliers, remained steady at 29%. That compares to a 43.5% median gap at the Barclays International banking group, a 32.8% gap at Lloyds and a 22.6% gap at the Co-operative Bank. On a mean basis the gaps were 48%, 32.8% and 30.3%. HSBC said it wants women to hold 30% of senior roles by 2020 and it would request gender diverse shortlists when hiring new leaders and would ensure gender balance in its workforce development programmes. It has also expanded opportunities for mentoring for women in well-paid global banking and markets roles and said it was encouraging flexible working and shared parental leave. It said it was \u201cconfident in its approach to pay\u201d and if it identified pay differences between men and women in similar roles which could not be explained by performance or experience, it made \u201cappropriate adjustments\u201d. \u201cWe are making progress. Improving our gender balance will take time and require sustained focus over the long-term,\u201d the company said. All private and public sector organisations and charities with more than 250 employees are required to submit their pay figures to the government by April under the new scheme. About 2,250 have filed figures so far, but the legislation is expected to affect about 9,000 companies, which collectively employ more than 15 million people. EasyJet and Virgin Money are among those that have revealed a gap of more than 30% in the mean hourly pay rates between male and female workers. On Thursday, British luxury brand Burberry revealed that its female staff earned an average 25.9% less per hour, despite making up the majority of employees at every pay quartile. The company said the disparity was the result of employing more men than women in senior roles immediately below its executive team. Marco Gobbetti, chief executive of Burberry, said: \u201cWith women making up 70% of our 3,500 employees in the UK, we are committed to narrowing this gap as we work to develop more women leaders to drive the growth and success of our business.\u201d Until Thursday, the travel group Tui held the dubious crown for the largest gender pay gap reported by a major UK company under the new scheme. Its male employees paid more than double the female staff. Women at the group\u2019s Tui Airways UK unit earn on average 56.9% less in hourly pay. The company said the gap stemmed from low representation of women in highly paid roles such as pilots, engineering, technology and senior management. This article was amended on 29 March 2018 to clarify that 60% is HSBC\u2019s provisional mean pay gap for 2018.",

      "bodyText": "Nothing to do with Brexit? Actually, one shouldn\u2019t be too sceptical about chief executive Paul Polman\u2019s \u201ccategorical\u201d denial that Brexit shaped Unilever\u2019s choice of Rotterdam over London. Leaving the EU plainly didn\u2019t help the UK\u2019s pitch, but one suspects the Netherlands got the nod for two unrelated reasons \u2013 one the company is happy to shout about, and one that it isn\u2019t. First, the official technical one. Some 55% of Unilever\u2019s shares are currently held via the Dutch NV company, as opposed to the UK plc, and the group reports its results in euros. Sole incorporation in the Netherlands was the more natural way to unpick an Anglo-Dutch structure that has existed since the merger of Margarine Unie and Lever Brothers in 1929. At Relx, the former Anglo-Dutch combine Reed Elsevier, the currency and share factors were the other way around. The company opted for London as its sole HQ last month, a decision that should not be sniffed at. The owner of LexisNexis has a gloriously low profile but it is a top-20 FTSE 100 company, only slightly smaller than Barclays. The second factor \u2013 despite the formal denials \u2013 is surely the Dutch and UK views of hostile takeovers. Unilever folk like the Dutch approach. Remember the context. Unilever\u2019s review was prompted by last year\u2019s \u00a3115bn offer from the US giant Kraft Heinz. Polman defeated the bid over a weekend but the episode was an almighty shock to the corporate sense of identity. Unilever could previously assume it was so big it was immune to hostile raiders, even those with a \u201cfast and ruthless\u201d style, as Polman described Kraft. It was surprised to find everybody is seen as fair game these days. Unilever hates the accusation it is seeking sanctuary in the Netherlands. It is true, as Polman argues, that UK and Dutch takeover codes are similar. But, come on, he has said time and again that \u201ca level playing field\u201d is more likely to encourage the inclusive form of \u201cstakeholder\u201d capitalism that Unilever preaches, and he has always implied that Dutch fields are flatter. Note that the US group PPG encountered a political storm last year when it tried, and failed, to buy the famous Dutch paint-maker AkzoNobel. Dutch scepticism about hostile bids may not have been the clincher, but it must have entered Unilever\u2019s thinking. Nor should anyone be surprised that a company with a Dutch chairman and a Dutch chief executive picked the country where the prime minister, Mark Rutte, is a former Unilever employee. Does the choice of the Netherlands matter? It does in that Unilever will probably disappear from the FTSE 100 index. That\u2019s an embarrassing blow for the London market. It is also a defeat for ministers who lobbied furiously for London and would have crowed if they had succeeded. But the UK jobs, as Unilever was at pains to say, are staying and two of the three divisions will be run from the UK. If the operational bases for personal care or home products had been exported, the link to Brexit would have been direct, obvious and alarming. Such calamities will probably follow in time elsewhere in UK industry, but Unilever\u2019s legal rejig doesn\u2019t qualify. Airbus warning may mean turbulence for Melrose\u2019s GKN bid \u201cIt would be practically impossible for us to give any new work to GKN under such an ownership model when we don\u2019t know who will be the long-term investor.\u201d That\u2019s one hell of a statement for a senior Airbus executive \u2013 Tom Williams, chief operating officer of the commercial aircraft division \u2013 to make. Everybody knows whose model he means \u2013 that of Melrose, currently bidding \u00a38bn for GKN. If the threat/warning/statement is sincere, it\u2019s hard to dismiss as irrelevant. Airbus is GKN\u2019s biggest customer, representing \u00a3700m of revenue, or 20% in the aerospace division. Melrose can declare that it would spend as freely on research and development as GKN, but Williams\u2019s main point is different. He\u2019s worried about who will eventually own GKN\u2019s businesses. Since Melrose aims to sell everything it buys within three to five years, there\u2019s no easy comeback on that score. One could take the view that the comments are a ruse. Airbus and GKN are obviously cosy. And Mike Turner, chairman of GKN, used to be the boss of BAE Systems, which used to have a 20% stake in Airbus. Well, yes, but Williams\u2019s remarks are a long way from the usual rough and tumble of takeover bids. Maybe Airbus means it. Melrose has a telephone call arranged with Williams\u2019s French boss. Let\u2019s see what that \u201ctrust us\u201d pitch produces.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIf you reach out your hand, you can touch her and direct her,\u201d the female assistant says as she guides Steve, a potential investor, through the bold new world of the cryptocurrency-backed virtual reality adult entertainment industry. The assistant asks Steve to wear a VR headset, sit comfortably and hold a remote control in each hand. Steve does as he is instructed and extends his left arm towards the naked lap dancer in front of him in the virtual seedy bar. As he holds out his arm, a crowd of would-be investors gather round the screen in the company\u2019s booth at the Crypto Investor Show in central London. Me.Mento and its porn brand VRXcity have come to the capital to find investors for what they claim will be the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency-funded VR porn. The assistant adds: \u201cThis is the future of pornography.\u201d And, at least in this conference centre booth, it is the future of cryptocurrency, the investment craze that has propelled bitcoin into the headlines. The company told potential investors at the show in the Queen Elizabeth II Centre near the Houses of Parliament that there were less than 10 days left to pre-register for its redBUX crypto token before the initial coin offering (ICO). An ICO is how a new cryptocurrency \u2013 a virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and is not issued by any central bank \u2013 is launched. Investors subscribe, usually paying in bitcoin, receive the new currency and then start spending it, hoping that as it circulates, it increases in value. More than 2,000 people attended the show last weekend, which was billed as helping the general public invest in digital currencies and \u201creap great rewards\u201d. Me.Mento\u2019s RedBUX is one of dozens of new cryptocoins and tokens being pitched to investors at the trade fair, which organisers described as \u201cthe UK\u2019s biggest crypto and blockchain event for investors\u201d. Two booths down is a stand for Kidcoin, a currency designed for parents to pay their children for completing chores or simply staying out of trouble. Arman Rousta, Kidcoin\u2019s founder and chief executive, said the company\u2019s coins can only be spent at vetted vendors, so parents can be assured their children would not be able to buy anything inappropriate. Although conceding that it might be easier for parents to give their children a traditional allowance, Rousta said a growing number of children and parents do not use cash. \u201cThis is much more intuitive than cash and it is easier to set long-term goals with Kidcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are kind of gamifying kids\u2019 allowances to make it more like video games. There are targets to hit, with rewards unlocked. We are trying to help build kids\u2019 confidence and self sufficiency.\u201d Patrick Dooley, the founder and chief executive of the trade fair, said he had sold more than 2,500 tickets. Hundreds of those who bought tickets, with wares including cryptocurrency investments for sports cars and retirement complexes, queued for up to an hour to enter the conference centre. Dooley stood on balustrades to apologise to frustrated visitors, who had travelled from as far afield as Glasgow and Cornwall to learn about investing in bitcoin and its peers, such as ethereum, ripple and litecoin. The value of bitcoin has fluctuated wildly in recent months, rising to nearly $20,000 (\u00a314,350) at the end of last year to its current level of about $8,000. This week, Google said it would ban all adverts for cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ICOs, dealing a blow to investor sentiment for an asset with a value that often swings on interventions by governments and regulators around the world. The head of International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, also warned that cryptocurrencies could become a \u201cmajor new vehicle for money laundering and the financing of terrorism\u201d. Dooley is well aware of the power of states and watchdogs over cryptocurrencies. \u201cWe wanted to be right in the centre of London opposite the Houses of Parliament, given that governance and regulation is such a big talking point in the sector,\u201d he said of his choice of venue. Dooley said talk of cryptocurrency regulation should ease investors\u2019 nerves. \u201cWe wanted to open up the space [cryptocurrencies] to the everyday investor because they should really know about it,\u201d he said. Mohammed Shukeel, 39, an engineering student from Birmingham and fledgling crypto-investor, said he had travelled to London for the conference to make face-to-face contact with other investors. \u201cI started investing last year, with a bit of bitcoin, some ethereum and a bit of ripple,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather not say how much money I\u2019ve made, but it has been quite a lot.\u201d Slightly behind Shukeel in the 500-person queue stood Bernardo Pro, 21, from Mexico, studying at Kings\u2019s College London. \u201cI\u2019m here out of curiosity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou hear so many people talking about bitcoin and the other ones and how much money they have made. I just thought I\u2019d check it out. \u201cI did open a bitcoin account about six years ago, but I got bored and sold them. They\u2019d probably have been worth loads if I\u2019d held on to them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Newsflash: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has urged countries to avoid being sucked into a global trade war in the wake of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. In a new blogpost, Lagarde calls for a multilateral approach to trade disagreements, and warns that no-one can win a trade war (That looks like a rebuttal of Donald Trump\u2019s claim that they\u2019re easy to win). Lagarde writes: \u201cPolicy makers need to work constructively together to reduce trade barriers and resolve trade disagreements\u201d without resorting to such tactics, \u201cThey should ensure that the recently announced U.S. import tariffs do not lead to a wider escalation of protectionist measures. Economic history clearly shows that trade wars not only hurt global growth, but they are also unwinnable.\u201d Time for a recap Donald Trump\u2019s new top economic advisor has called for a \u201ctrade coalition of the willing\u201d of allies to work with America to tackle China over trade. Larry Kudlow argues that Beijing deserves a \u2018tough response\u2019 - a sign that the White House isn\u2019t ending its protectionist push. China has hit back, with a government official warning that \u2018appeasement\u2019 was not an option if Washington unleashed more tariffs. A Chinese state-owned tabloid newspaper also called the US out, saying it should make Americans \u201cmore hard-working\u201d. Germany has weighed in too; its economy ministry fears \u2018tangible\u2019 damage to the global economy Worries over tariffs have helped to push the aluminum price down to a three-month low today. Stocks, though, have managed a small rise -- the Dow is up, after three daily drops in a row. Financial analysts have warned that a trade war would hurt the markets, and send investors diving out of riskier assets. Donald Trump has revealed that he pretended the US had a trade deficit with Canada when he met Justin Trudeau recently. On the economic front, the number of American\u2019s filing new claims for jobless benefit has dropped. I\u2019ll be back later with any major developments.... The aluminum price has hit a three-month low today, suggesting that the new US tariffs are beginning to bite. The cost of a tonne of aluminum fell to $2,085 per tonne, its lowest level since before Christmas 2017. President Trump\u2019s decision to put a 10% tariffs on aluminum imports (excluding Canada and Mexico), is one factor; Norbert Ruecker of Julius Baer points out that they will hit demand: \u201cIf you look at the impact, the trade tariffs will, in the end, be deflationary globally,\u201d. The president is defending himself over today\u2019s story that he challenged Canada\u2019s prime minister over trade without knowing the facts (see earlier post). But....as Bloomberg\u2019s Mike McKee points out - the US government\u2019s own trade offices says it runs a surplus! Worries over trade wars seem to be hitting Boeing again. Shares in the aircraft maker are down almost 1.7% in early trading, making it the worst performer on the Dow. That\u2019s despite reports that Boeing could scoop a major new order, to supply fighter jets to India. Ding Ding: The New York stock exchange has rung the opening bell, and investor are trying to break a three-day losing streak. The Dow has opened higher, gaining 80 points of 0.3%. Traders are encouraged by today\u2019s strong US jobless figures. Energy stocks and financial firms are leading the way, with JP Morgan up 0.4% Some experts are relieved that Donald Trump has chosen Larry Kudlow as his new top economic adviser. One alternative was Peter Navarro, who helped craft Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy. He\u2019s a big supporter of tariffs, and a vocal critic of free trade - arguing that America is getting a rough deal as its intellectual property is snaffled by China. In contrast to Navarro, Kudlow is a more reassuring choice for the markets. Rabobank analyst Bas van Geffen told clients: \u201cMarkets may actually find some comfort in the fact that Mr. Trump decided to give the job to Kudlow, rather than someone with more radical economic beliefs, such as Peter Navarro, who is even more skeptical about the current free trade paradigm. Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research, dubbed Kudlow a \u201ccheerleader for growth\u201d, adding: \u201cHe regularly says \u2018Free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity.\u2019 He is a forceful advocate for open markets and trade liberalization, and more generally an economic libertarian who favors low taxes and less regulation.\u201d A dream candidate for Wall Street, in other words. But there is still jitteriness, simply because president Trump will be the one making the big calls on whether to slap fresh tariffs on Chinese technology imports, or European cars. Donald Trump should be cheered by the latest drop in US unemployment claims, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at trading firm UFX.com: \u201cThe US employment market has remained on a steady course of late, and with the latest figures showing a further fall in initial claimants, Donald Trump will surely use the opportunity to champion his job-boosting credentials as he embarks on the formative stages of a re-election campaign. \u201cA robust jobs market was a key pillar in his road to the White House and although there may be some who argue the success has come on the back of a healthier international economy, it\u2019s hard to argue with the results. Newsflash: The latest US unemployment figures show that America\u2019s labor market remains pretty strong. Just 226,000 Americans signed on for unemployment benefits last week, down from 230,000 in the previous seven days. That\u2019s close to the 48-year low struck in late February. It\u2019s also the 158th month in a row in which the \u2018initial claims\u2019 figure has come in below 300,000 -- traditionally the threshold for a robust jobs market. Wall Street analysts fear that Boeing could be a major victim from a trade war. Shares in the airline have fallen by over 8% this month, as tensions over president Trump\u2019s protectionist leanings have intensified. China is a key market for Boeing, which secured a $37bn deal to sell 300 planes to China Aviation Suppliers last November. Larry Kudlow\u2019s plan to build a coalition to force China to change its trade policies could put future such deals in doubt, if relations between Washington and Beijing deteriorate. As Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, put it to CNBC: \u201cThe question is really not economic. It\u2019s political at this point.\u201d China has pushed back against the criticism from Donald Trump and Larry Kudlow. With fresh tariffs looming, Beijing argues that America needs to work harder if it wants to close its whopping trade gap. Chinese officials are also warning that they will hit back, if America presses on with unilateral tariffs [Trump wants to cut the US-China trade deficit by $100bn]. Reuters has the details: In a Thursday editorial, widely-read Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said the United States was trying to play the victim. \u201cIf the U.S. wants to reduce its trade deficit, it has to make Americans more hard-working and conduct reforms in accordance with international market demand, instead of asking the rest of the world to change. \u201cOnce a trade war starts, capable countries won\u2019t bow to the U.S. China has tried hard to avoid a trade war, but if one breaks out, appeasement is not an option.\u201d Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said history showed that trade wars are in nobody\u2019s interests, but that China would protect its legitimate rights if \u201csomething happens we don\u2019t want to see\u201d. Ever the early riser, president Trump has just tweeted that America can look forward to years of \u2018fair trade\u2019. He\u2019s also confirmed Larry Kudlow\u2019s appointment to lead his National Economic Council. A profit warning from soapmaker PZ Cussons has taken the shine off the mood in the City today. Shares in PZ Cussons, which makes Imperial Leather soap and Original Source shower gel, tumbled by 15% as traders made a clean exit from the company. It admitted that earnings will miss forecasts, claiming that British consumers were cutting back on washing products. The UK washing and bathing division has continued to experience lower levels of purchases reflecting consumer caution across all retail channels caused by economic uncertainty and inflation out-stripping wage growth. This has also hit other consumer goods makers, with Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser both down around 1.5%. Across the markets, the European stocks markets are a little higher, but trade war worries abound. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says: The FTSE started the day higher, although there appeared little for traders to cheers. Sentiment remained downbeat as concerns of an all out trade war weighed, particularly in light of the Team which Trump is building at the White House, which is pointing to the more aggressively interventionist as far as foreign policy goes. Added to the concerns over Trumps newly formed team, reports that the President is looking to slap tariffs on $60 million worth of imports from China, no longer just steel and aluminium, is unnerving investors. Germany is increasingly worried that a global trade war could break out, hurting its growth and the wider global economy. In a new monthly report, the German economy ministry warns that the new US tariffs on some metal imports could cause uncertainty, and hurt trade. The ministry points out that the global economy is strengthening, but fears that protectionism could scupper this progress. It says: For the global economy, the IMF and, more recently, the OECD for the years 2018 and 2019 now expect growth of 3.9% each. However, this does not take into account the recently introduced US tariffs on steel and aluminum. These could significantly affect trade in some regions. However, the impact on the global economy as a whole should remain manageable. However, a possible escalation of a trade war and increasing uncertainty among market participants could cause tangible damage. It\u2019s important to note that Unilever isn\u2019t quitting its impressive headquarters at Blackfriars. Some staff will move to the new corporate HQ in Rotterdam. However, the company - dubbed Uni-leaver by some wags on social media - says its 7,300 UK-based employees won\u2019t be affected by the change. Even so, legal blogger David Allen Green is struck by the symbolism: The London Mayor\u2019s office are gutted that Unilever has chosen the Netherlands over Britain as its single legal base. Rajesh Agrawal, deputy mayor for business, argues that it shows the importance of keeping close ties with the EU after Brexit (even though Unilever insist Brexit wasn\u2019t a factor): Agrawal says: \u201cUnilever\u2019s decision to move its headquarters to the Netherlands is clearly disappointing news for the capital. It brings into sharp focus the need for the Government to secure a Brexit deal that secures London as Europe\u2019s leading business centre. The best way to do this is for London and the UK to remain part of the Single Market and Customs Union.\u201d The big news in the City this morning is that Unilever has chosen Rotterdam over London as the site of its new corporate base, ending its dual-HQ structure. After weeks of speculation, the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant plumped for the Netherlands over the UK. It is insisting that Brexit isn\u2019t to blame, and there won\u2019t be job losses, but the decision is a blow to the City\u2019s prestige. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant, has picked Rotterdam over London as its main base in a move seen as a blow to the government in the wake of the Brexit vote. The group, which makes a number of well-known consumer brands including Persil, Dove and Marmite, has been based in London and Rotterdam for nearly a century. The Unilever chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, insisted Brexit \u201cwas absolutely not a factor\u201d in the decision, which was announced after a board meeting and a year-long review. Here\u2019s her full story: The Daily Mail think Unilever is trying to protect itself from a hostile takeover, having fought off Kraft Heinz last year. Overnight, Donald Trump gave a worrying insight into his negotiating approach with other world leaders. Speaking to donors at a fundraiser in Missouri, Trump bragged about how he\u2019d argued with Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau over trade - without actually knowing the facts. The Washington Post has the story: President Trump boasted in a fundraising speech Wednesday that he made up information in a meeting with the leader of a top U.S. ally, saying he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the United States runs a trade deficit with its neighbor to the north without knowing whether that was the case. \u201cTrudeau came to see me. He\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cNice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \u2018Donald, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 He\u2019s very proud because everybody else, you know, we\u2019re getting killed. \u201c... So, he\u2019s proud. I said, \u2018Wrong, Justin, you do.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You know why? Because we\u2019re so stupid. \u2026 And I thought they were smart. I said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong, Justin.\u2019 He said, \u2018Nope, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, in that case, I feel differently,\u2019 I said, \u2018but I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019 I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \u2018Check, because I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019 Trump\u2019s punchline is that America does run a trade deficit with Canada (as he claimed). However, US trade data actually shows a $12.5bn surplus (a $25bn surplus in services, minus a $12.5bn deficit in goods). Here\u2019s the full story: In fundraising speech, Trump says he made up trade claim in meeting with Justin Trudeau My colleague Ed Helmore has written a profile on Larry Kudlow. It covers his time working with Ronald Reagan in the 80s to his rehabilitation after being fired from Wall Street firm Bear Stearns over his cocaine addiction. Mazen Issa, senior foreign exchange strategist at TD Securities, says investors are concerned about Donald Trump\u2019s next move: \u201cThe Trump administration is rumoured to be preparing another tariff, this time aimed at China\u201d \u201cTaken in conjunction with speculation of additional cabinet reshuffles, broader risk sentiment could be vulnerable.\u201d Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM warns that trade wars are bad for growth: With Wall Street pummelled by rising fears of U.S protectionism on Wednesday, U.S stocks are at risk of extending losses this afternoon if the negative sentiment prevails. Risk aversion could become a dominant market theme moving forward, as concerns intensify over escalating trade tensions negatively impacting global growth. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets wonders if Kudlow and Trump will get along like a house on fire: Concern that the US administration was looking to widen the scope of tariffs to Chinese goods to the tune of $60bn weighed on investors\u2019 appetite for risk, though the declines were fairly moderate. This may have been down to the appointment of Larry Kudlow as President Trump\u2019s new economic adviser, who has stated that he is not a big fan of blanket tariffs, which should make for an interesting discussion with his new boss. America\u2019 Dow Jones index shed 1% last night, with Boeing dropping 2.5% amid worries about an escalating trade spat. Asian markets have been mixed today; Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 has dropped by 0.25%, India has dipped a little, while the Philippines index has shed almost 2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The prospect of a protectionist trade war between the world\u2019s major economics continues to loom over the markets today. Donald Trump\u2019s new economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, has intensified the pressure by claiming that Beijing hasn\u2019t played by the rules - and needs reining in. Kudlow was named as the new director of the National Economic Council on Wednesday, and promptly went on the air to tell China to expect a tough approach. He told CBNC that: \u201cI must say as somebody who doesn\u2019t like tariffs, I think China has earned a tough response not only from the United States... \u201cA thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they\u2019re breaking the rules left and right,\u201d . That\u2019s the way I\u2019d like to see. You call it a sort of a trade coalition of the willing.\u201d [that\u2019s a reference to George Bush\u2019s 2003 Iraq War coalition...] This has done little to assuage concerns that Trump will soon launch new tariffs on Chinese imports, such as technology and telecommunications products. Kudlow (a former Reagan advisor and Wall Street economist), has criticised tariffs in the past. But he\u2019s happy to back Trump\u2019s new steel and aluminium tariffs. He told CNBC that he was relieved that Trump had exempted Canada and Mexico, and perhaps Australia. Europe might also qualify for an exemption too, he hinted, if they cut some of the tariffs they impose on US goods. I don\u2019t like blanket tariffs and I don\u2019t think you should punish your friends to try and punish your enemies in international affairs. My problem is the principle of the thing, I just don\u2019t like blanket tariffs. Otherwise, the agenda is a little quiet, but there is some US economic data later: The agenda 12.30pm: US Empire Manufacturing survey 12.30pm: US weekly jobless figures",

The deal never happened, of course, but the tale wasn\u2019t idle gossip. Gazprom executives created the excitement by saying an acquisition of Centrica was being \u201canalysed and investigated\u201d, a statement that sent the UK company\u2019s shares up 25% on one day in February. Cautious voices warned that it would be absurd for the UK to entrust ownership of its largest energy supplier to a company which, for practical purposes, is an arm of the Russian state. At roughly the same time, remember, Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. But the UK prime minister of the day was relaxed. Here\u2019s the FT on 25 April 2006, a day after Gazprom\u2019s deputy chief executive had met then-trade secretary Alan Johnson in London: \u201cTony Blair has ruled out any possibility that UK ministers might actively seek to block a future bid by Russia\u2019s Gazprom for Centrica.\u201d The priority, apparently, was to face down \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d.

Thin reasoning behind Prudential demerger What is the problem the Prudential is trying to solve via demerger? A separation of the UK and European business, to be branded M&amp;G Prudential, from the faster-growing Asian and US business, which will keep the main Prudential name, has been rumoured for ages. But, when the moment arrived, the business case sounded thin. The idea, supposedly, is that a liberated M&amp;G Prudential will burst into the spotlight as a UK national champion of fund management and savings and investments. It won\u2019t, for example, have to compete with the Asian end of Pru for capital since it will be a separate company. Hold on, though. M&amp;G hasn\u2019t been obviously held back by the current structure. It\u2019s doing fine, and has done for years. As for competition for capital, are you sure? The Pru\u2019s full-year figures for 2017 showed a surplus over regulatory minimums of \u00a313.3bn. That seems enough to fund expansion in Asia and get bigger at home. Indeed, the steadier UK operation could be seen as useful ballast in the years when the go-go east turns volatile. The group denies the split is an exercise in \u201cregulatory arbitrage,\u201d or a way of placing the Asian and US operations beyond tough European solvency requirements. Fine, but the only other factor seems to be pressure from those big shareholders who prefer to arrange their investments into neat buckets. An Asian offering (with a heavy serving of the US) could be deemed tidier than one where the UK is part of the mix.

      "bodyText": "Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant, has picked Rotterdam over London as its sole headquarters but denied the move was related to the Brexit vote. Britain\u2019s third-biggest company, which makes a number of well-known consumer brands including Marmite, Dove soap and Magnum ice-cream, has been based in London and Rotterdam for nearly a century. The Unilever chief executive, Paul Polman, insisted the decision, which was announced after a year-long review, \u201chas nothing to do with Brexit\u201d and would not result in the loss of any UK jobs. He also said there would be \u201cno change to tax\u201d paid in the UK. The group, which has two parent companies, is to simplify its structure into a single legal entity incorporated in the Netherlands. Its shares will continue to be listed in London, Amsterdam and New York, although it is unclear whether Unilever will still be in the FTSE 100 index. Rajesh Agrawal, the London deputy mayor for business, said the move was \u201cdisappointing news for the capital\u201d. He added: \u201cIt brings into sharp focus the need for the government to secure a Brexit deal that secures London as Europe\u2019s leading business centre. The best way to do this is for London and the UK to remain part of the single market and customs union.\u201d Unilever said its 7,300 employees across 20 sites in the UK and 3,100 staff in the Netherlands would be unaffected by the changes, which are aimed at making the group a \u201csimpler, more agile and more focused business\u201d. The firm employs 169,000 people worldwide. It is moving a small number of people from London to Rotterdam, but is keeping its building at Blackfriars in London. Unilever has had two parent companies since its creation from the 1929 merger of the British soap maker Lever Brothers and the Dutch company Margarine Unie. It said the move to a single entity based in the Netherlands reflected the fact that the Dutch entity represents 55% of the group\u2019s share capital and that the shares listed in the Netherlands are more liquid. The chairman, Marijn Dekkers, said: \u201cWith our 55% shareholder base we need to make the decision for the Netherlands. We are committed to both the UK and the Netherlands. That is reflected in the decision that you have the faster-growing divisions headquartered in the UK.\u201d The company is restructuring its business into three divisions with more autonomy and financial responsibility, two of which \u2013 beauty and personal care, and home care \u2013 will be headquartered in London. They are already largely based in the UK, but the division heads will move to London from overseas. This secures nearly \u00a31bn of annual spending in the UK, including on research and development. The third division, foods and refreshments, will still be based in Rotterdam. The company decided to review its dual corporate structure after fending off a \u00a3115bn takeover approach from US food giant Kraft Heinz a year ago. Polman questioned the UK takeover rules at the time, arguing they were more liberal than in the US or the Netherlands. However, he denied on Thursday that Unilever\u2019s move to Rotterdam was motivated by takeover rules. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, who used to work for Unilever, has also pushed through tax changes to attract more overseas companies. Bart Le Blanc, a partner at global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright in Amsterdam, said: \u201cThe investment and regulatory environment in the Netherlands is highly attractive for multinational enterprises. A key element to this is the proposed abolition of Dutch dividend withholding tax. Unilever is a great example of the Dutch government\u2019s focus and we see similar developments in, for instance, the financial services industry.\u201d The UK\u2019s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cAs the company itself has made clear, its decision to transfer a small number of jobs to a corporate HQ in the Netherlands is part of a long-term restructuring plan of the company and is not connected to the UK\u2019s departure from the EU.\u201d However, Lee Wild, the head of equity strategy at online trading platform Interactive Investor, said: \u201cUnilever will still have a London listing and two of the divisions will be based here, but making the main headquarters in Rotterdam will hurt Theresa May at a key point in Brexit negotiations with the EU.\u201d",
