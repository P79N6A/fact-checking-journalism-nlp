      "bodyText": "Britain risks locking itself into an expensive and unnecessary programme of power plant construction under flawed new policies being pursued by the government, a key committee of MPs has warned. Consumers could be forced to underwrite more than \u00a3350m of extra spending in the first year alone if ministers do not put more emphasis on reducing power demand rather than building more capacity, according to the energy and climate change committee. In a letter to energy minister Matthew Hancock the committee chairman, Tim Yeo, also accuses the UK's main energy infrastructure provider, National Grid, which is playing a key role in the schemes, of being hopelessly compromised. \"It is impossible for National Grid to give objective advice to government on this issue since the profitability of their regulated United Kingdom business is directly linked to the construction of new transmission capacity,\" he wrote. His committee has been taking evidence in what is called \"electricity demand-side measures\" to review the role being proposed for those who can help reduce the need for power. This is particularly valuable now, when the UK is facing an energy crisis, because old coal and nuclear plants are being retired and new windfarms or gas plants are not being built quickly enough. Yeo told Hancock that demand-side response (DSR) offered a cheap and greener alternative to building new generating capacity. He added that it should play a crucial and growing role in keeping the lights on in coming years. He praised the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change (DECC), the regulator Ofgem and the National Grid for progressing initiatives but fears unnecessary obstacles are also being thrown in the way of this new industry. \"Many DSR industry representatives have expressed serious and legitimate concerns,\" Yeo said. Among those worries are that DSR providers can only win contracts for one year while power station builders can get deals that run for 15 years. The \u00a3359m annual cost of building new power stations as opposed to reducing demand mentioned by Yeo is taken from a new study, also out on Friday, by NERA Economic Consulting, which is working for DSR companies such as KiWi Power. A DECC spokesman said it was too early to comment on the NERA report but defended the role of National Grid and said the infrastructure provider was doing all it could to understand the concerns of the demand reduction providers. \"We are talking to the DSR industry to better understand the issues they face.

      "body": "<p>Clothing retailer Next is going after well-heeled shoppers for the first time stocking \u00a3300 suits and \u00a3150 evening dresses that will compete directly with Marks &amp; Spencer's upmarket Autograph label.</p> <p>\"We are pushing the boundaries of the Next brand,\" said Lord Wolfson, its chief executive, as the retailer reported an almost 20% increase in first-half profits. \"We know our customers buy jackets and dresses for more than \u00a3100 so we thought we'd have a crack at selling them.\"</p> <p>Next usually prices its eveningwear at under \u00a380, but Wolfson said it had stretched its prices to include \"premium products selling at prices we would previously have shied away from\".</p> <p>The initiative follows strong first-half sales, with the retailer attributing some of its success to taking greater risks with its fashion collections. It has also started buying stock for all four seasons, rather than dividing the year into two as most retailers do, helping it to have more weather appropriate clothing on sale during the unpredictable spring and autumn months.</p> <p>Pre-tax profits at Next jumped 19% to \u00a3324m in the six months to July with the retailer continuing to outperform rivals such as M&amp;S thanks to its fast growing home shopping business Directory as well as expansion overseas. Despite the big leap in profits the figures fell short of some analysts' expectations and the shares closed down 3% at \u00a369.50.</p> <p>Next recently launched a website in China and Wolfson said the vast market presented an interesting opportunity. But he cautioned it also presented \"many logistical and administrative challenges\", and would not generate meaningful sales for some time as the retailer learned how best to operate in the country.</p> <p>The Tory peer, who is a member of George Osborne's inner circle, said Next's performance had also been buoyed by the improving economy, low interest rate environment and the availability of credit. But he pointed to clouds on the horizon: \"When interest rates do go up the Next customer base is likely to be affected more than most. We're at the top end of the mass market and a lot of our customers are at the peak stage of their mortgage.\"</p> <p>The department store chain John Lewis also reported a strong first half with operating profits up by 62% to \u00a356.3m. Last year its results were depressed by exceptional staff costs relating to miscalculated holiday pay and a round of redundancies among its department store managers. Like-for-like sales were up 8.2% for the six months to 26 July.</p> <p>Its managing director, Andy Street, said sales had been boosted by loyalty card perks such as free coffee and cake. The revival in the housing market boosted its home furnishings departments, where sales were up 7.4%.

      "bodyText": "Clothing retailer Next is going after well-heeled shoppers for the first time stocking \u00a3300 suits and \u00a3150 evening dresses that will compete directly with Marks &amp; Spencer's upmarket Autograph label. \"We are pushing the boundaries of the Next brand,\" said Lord Wolfson, its chief executive, as the retailer reported an almost 20% increase in first-half profits. \"We know our customers buy jackets and dresses for more than \u00a3100 so we thought we'd have a crack at selling them.\" Next usually prices its eveningwear at under \u00a380, but Wolfson said it had stretched its prices to include \"premium products selling at prices we would previously have shied away from\". The initiative follows strong first-half sales, with the retailer attributing some of its success to taking greater risks with its fashion collections. It has also started buying stock for all four seasons, rather than dividing the year into two as most retailers do, helping it to have more weather appropriate clothing on sale during the unpredictable spring and autumn months. Pre-tax profits at Next jumped 19% to \u00a3324m in the six months to July with the retailer continuing to outperform rivals such as M&amp;S thanks to its fast growing home shopping business Directory as well as expansion overseas. Despite the big leap in profits the figures fell short of some analysts' expectations and the shares closed down 3% at \u00a369.50. Next recently launched a website in China and Wolfson said the vast market presented an interesting opportunity. But he cautioned it also presented \"many logistical and administrative challenges\", and would not generate meaningful sales for some time as the retailer learned how best to operate in the country. The Tory peer, who is a member of George Osborne's inner circle, said Next's performance had also been buoyed by the improving economy, low interest rate environment and the availability of credit. But he pointed to clouds on the horizon: \"When interest rates do go up the Next customer base is likely to be affected more than most. We're at the top end of the mass market and a lot of our customers are at the peak stage of their mortgage.\" The department store chain John Lewis also reported a strong first half with operating profits up by 62% to \u00a356.3m. Last year its results were depressed by exceptional staff costs relating to miscalculated holiday pay and a round of redundancies among its department store managers. Like-for-like sales were up 8.2% for the six months to 26 July. Its managing director, Andy Street, said sales had been boosted by loyalty card perks such as free coffee and cake. The revival in the housing market boosted its home furnishings departments, where sales were up 7.4%. The retailer, part of the John Lewis Partnership, also reported bumper fashion sales, up 9.1% \u2013 fuelled by a 33.9% increase in online orders \u2013 after it made it easier for shoppers to browse the website via their smartphone.",

The move triggered nationwide protests with shopowners, tradesmen and employees taking to the streets. Federations representing thousands of shopkeepers and workers resorted to the Council of State in July saying the law should be declared \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d</p> <p>Many argued that working on the one day of the week that, constitutionally, had been decreed a day or rest, would be bad for their health.</p> <p>The court, whose verdict is to be followed by a further judgment at the end of the year, agreed that the measure would neither lead to increased work nor, at a time of record unemployment, reduced joblessness as government officials had claimed.</p> <p>Instead, it said, Sunday shopping denied workers the right of \u201cfree time and enjoying their families on Sunday, the common day of rest and of exercising religious duties.\u201d</p> <p>For Greece\u2019s lenders the row over Sunday shopping highlights the extent to which the country remains a closed economy, much in need of modernisation. Prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 government had tried to persuade Greeks that deregulaton of trading hours would be good for employment and increase competition.</p> <p>Opponents, however, had found an ally in the powerful Greek Orthodox church which had also come out vehemently against Sunday shopping. It remains to be seen how the government will react to what some officials said would only be \u201ca temporary block\u201d on the ban being lifted. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-09-11T16:40:58.265Z\">at 5.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5411c099e4b0678f1b110b43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-11T15:49:26.840Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Over in Barcelona, thousands of people are on the streets demonstrating their support for independence for Catalonia</strong>. Separatist movements - not insignificant already - will surely receive a major boost if Scotland does vote yes in its referendum next week. Capital Economics has just issued a report entitled <em>Scottish independence could encourage separatists worldwide </em>looking at this very issue, and its analyst Andrew Kenningham wrote: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Scotland\u2019s referendum is being watched in all corners of the world. After all, there are separatist movements in numerous emerging economies, ranging from Sri Lanka and India to Turkey. And China, of course, has sensitivities about Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Whatever the outcome, the fact that Scotland\u2019s referendum is happening at all could invigorate many of these separatist movements.</p> <p>However, the separatist movements which seem most comparable to Scotland are in Flanders, Catalonia and Quebec, followed by Veneto in Italy and even Bavaria in Germany. Note that Quebec has held two referendums on independence and that the second of them, in 1995, was an exceptionally close call. Would these regions face the same challenges as an independent Scotland.</p> <p>The thorniest economic issue facing Scotland is the currency question. To recap, the nationalists would like an independent Scotland to continue using the pound, but all the major parties in Westminster have ruled this out. Edinburgh may therefore need to issue a new currency or adopt the euro. However, it may be difficult to persuade the other euro-zone members to agree to Scotland acceding to the euro- zone in the near term. And we doubt that Scotland will want to follow in Montenegro\u2019s footsteps by adopting another country\u2019s currency <em>unilaterally </em>as a permanent solution.</p> <p>Either way, there may be a long, damaging impasse before a solution is reached. Of the three regions listed above, only Quebec may face a similar currency dilemma. Flanders and Catalonia already use the euro and we suspect they would <em>remain </em>within the euro-zone if they became independent countries.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Igualitarista/statuses/510079062241726465\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>photo from helicopter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gelopezfageda\">@Gelopezfageda</a> 100s of 1000s protesting for independence in Barcelona:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/11s2014?src=hash\">#11s2014</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/bwgMXS0i0U\">pic.twitter.com/bwgMXS0i0U</a></p>&mdash; David Ferreira (@Igualitarista) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Igualitarista/status/510079062241726465\">September 11, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-01d06fb8-c3e0-4a99-a0e5-9ab5c47a9041\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/11/1410449658508/f6f92830-0b4f-4da7-a3df-9ada9ae2664a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Independence demonstration in Barcelona.

The group says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The governor of the Bank of England has provided written evidence to the Treasury Select Committee that confirms spending cuts or tax rises that would equate to at least \u00a34,000 per person in Scotland to match the currency reserves held by Denmark, which pegs to the euro. This is a conservative estimate and the actual figure could be much higher.</p> <p>To match the currency reserves held by Hong Kong, which pegs to the Dollar, would mean tax rises and spending cuts worth \u00a395 billion - the equivalent of \u00a318,000 per person in Scotland. This means there would need to be huge cuts to public spending on things like our NHS and pensions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>This letter provides further damning evidence of the massive cost to every Scot of going it alone. To match the reserves held by Denmark would cost each of us \u00a34000, but if we had to build up Hong Kong style reserves the cost would be five times greater.</strong><br></p> <p>In the end, that money would have to be found from every Scots wages, taxes, or the public services like the NHS that we cherish. It is extraordinary that this fundamental issue has not been talked about or thought about by nationalists.<br></p> <p>With higher costs and fewer businesses paying tax, the price would be paid in higher income tax and less money for the NHS.

For instance, Denmark\u2019s reserves to GDP ratio is 26% and Scotland\u2019s GDP is \u00a3130bn; thus, to achieve a reserves to GDP ratio equivalent to Denmark\u2019s, Scotland would require reserves totalling \u00a334bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d1cd2f9e-cb62-4ee7-9bc7-89fcf6c867c4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/11/1410435153472/2c2f308f-745b-46e9-b97d-638012b5231c-460x276.png\" alt=\"Currency reserves\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Countries using another currency or peg</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bank of England</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-09-11T12:08:15.017Z\">at 1.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54118638e4b0b49b582db4e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-11T11:27:14.808Z\">12.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A top Scottish law firm has moved its money out of Scottish banks for fear that a vote for independence would cause a run, <em>writes Sean Farrell</em>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to <strong><a href=\"http://www.thelawyer.com/news/top-scottish-firm-shifts-cash-to-english-banks-ahead-of-referendum/3025551.article\">a report in the Lawyer </a> </strong>the unnamed firm has shifted its cash because it fears a similar reaction to when Slovak customers moved their savings to Czech banks after Czechoslovakia split in 1993. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re moving our cash to English banks,\u201d a partner at the firm told The Lawyer. \u201cWhen Czechoslovakia split the flow of capital was very quick.</p> <p>\u201cWe bank with all UK banks but we\u2019re making sure all the big money is held in English-registered accounts rather than Scottish ones.\u201d</p> <p>The Lawyer said Scotland\u2019s leading corporate law firms had a slow start to the current financial year because their clients were putting investment and business decisions on hold because of the referendum.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54118168e4b0f4333c5dc6a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-11T11:22:19.158Z\">12.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Unite has called on Lloyds Banking Group to clarify its position on jobs if Scotland votes for independence next week.

If Salmond wants the credit of past North Sea oil revenue to be taken into account in Scotland\u2019s new balance sheet, then past debits should be factored in too.<br>  <strong>John Lewis</strong> has warned about keeping its pricing policy the same if Scotland leaves. But what about the <strong>Royal Mail</strong>? Does its universal service obligation continue of Scotland goes it alone? Or will the Shetland Islands have to pay much closer to the real cost of delivering to them? There are so many implications of Scotland\u2019s independence. Most of which will only be discovered if it happens. <br></p> <p>I was in Aberdeen for three days at the weekend. A couple of things struck me. Firstly that many people I met were still undecided. Secondly that any No voters were keeping quiet about it as Nationalistic fervour was gaining ground. And thirdly that Scotland does not want to go the way of the divisions of Northern Ireland. The divide seems to be getting deeper and the emotional debate heated. Although clearly the debate in Northern Ireland is religious as well as political, the divisions run deep. I fear for the future of unity within Scotland as the campaign becomes more bitter.<br>  There are so many uncertainties in this debate. Not least what happens to various company names? If Scotland votes yes, where does it leave RBS? It cannot continue as Royal Bank of Scotland? Does British Petroleum become the Rest of UK Petroleum? or RUKP?

Scotland\u2019s banking system is almost uniquely primed for such a system of \u2018adaptive sterlingisation\u2019.</p> <p>The path outlined in this paper would go almost unnoticed by the average Scot - until the next big economic shock, when they might just wonder why their system was so much more stable than that of the country they\u2019d left behind.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>The report noted that this would take Scotland back to the golden days of free banking of the 18th and 19th centuries.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Between 1716 and 1844, Scotland had one of the world\u2019s most stable and robust banking systems.

In addition, the company has returned to profitability after the previous full year loss, whilst the dividend hike adds to an existing yield of 6.7%, one of the highest within the FTSE100 and a clear attraction for income seekers. However, like for like sales, underlying and pre-tax profits are all sharply down on the corresponding period last year, the progress quoted in terms of the company\u2019s online and convenience store presence is nascent, whilst the ongoing assault from the discounters continues to crimp margins.  There may well be a recovery to come, and within Morrisons\u2019 three year plan significant cash generation and cost savings are forecast. The share price has certainly reflected its difficulties, despite today\u2019s spike, having fallen 40% over the last year, as opposed to a 4% rise in the wider FTSE100.

On top of that, new EU sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine are due to come into force on Friday. In the UK there is also, of course, uncertainty over the outcome of next week\u2019s Scottish referendum vote, although the latest poll gave the no vote a majority and helped Scottish-linked shares gain some ground. Overall the scores on the doors showed: The FTSE 100 finished 30.49 points or 0.45% lower at 6799.62 Germany\u2019s Dax was down 0.09% at 9691.28 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.22% down at 4440.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.23% to 21,092.24 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.47% at 10,886.3 In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 16 points or 0.09% lower. Meanwhile the pound is at $1.6230, off its best levels but still recovering from yesterday\u2019s 10 month low of $1.6051. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up the blog for tonight. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Meanwhile in Greece, the country\u2019s highest court has put the government once again on the defensive by declaring Sunday shopping to be illegal. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Stepping into the row over whether shops should remain open on Sundays, Greece\u2019s Council of State ruled that such commerce would neither be of benefit to the state nor shopowners and should therefore not be allowed. A pilot programme permitting shops to stay open on Sunday, would it reasoned, result in \u201cirreparable economic harm\u201d to shopkeepers, merchants and employees. Under pressure from the country\u2019s troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF to open up markets, the conservative-dominated coalition government lifted a longstanding ban on Sunday shopping earlier this summer. The move triggered nationwide protests with shopowners, tradesmen and employees taking to the streets. Federations representing thousands of shopkeepers and workers resorted to the Council of State in July saying the law should be declared \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Many argued that working on the one day of the week that, constitutionally, had been decreed a day or rest, would be bad for their health. The court, whose verdict is to be followed by a further judgment at the end of the year, agreed that the measure would neither lead to increased work nor, at a time of record unemployment, reduced joblessness as government officials had claimed. Instead, it said, Sunday shopping denied workers the right of \u201cfree time and enjoying their families on Sunday, the common day of rest and of exercising religious duties.\u201d For Greece\u2019s lenders the row over Sunday shopping highlights the extent to which the country remains a closed economy, much in need of modernisation. Prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 government had tried to persuade Greeks that deregulaton of trading hours would be good for employment and increase competition. Opponents, however, had found an ally in the powerful Greek Orthodox church which had also come out vehemently against Sunday shopping. It remains to be seen how the government will react to what some officials said would only be \u201ca temporary block\u201d on the ban being lifted. Over in Barcelona, thousands of people are on the streets demonstrating their support for independence for Catalonia. Separatist movements - not insignificant already - will surely receive a major boost if Scotland does vote yes in its referendum next week. Capital Economics has just issued a report entitled Scottish independence could encourage separatists worldwide looking at this very issue, and its analyst Andrew Kenningham wrote: Scotland\u2019s referendum is being watched in all corners of the world. After all, there are separatist movements in numerous emerging economies, ranging from Sri Lanka and India to Turkey. And China, of course, has sensitivities about Tibet, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Whatever the outcome, the fact that Scotland\u2019s referendum is happening at all could invigorate many of these separatist movements. However, the separatist movements which seem most comparable to Scotland are in Flanders, Catalonia and Quebec, followed by Veneto in Italy and even Bavaria in Germany. Note that Quebec has held two referendums on independence and that the second of them, in 1995, was an exceptionally close call. Would these regions face the same challenges as an independent Scotland. The thorniest economic issue facing Scotland is the currency question. To recap, the nationalists would like an independent Scotland to continue using the pound, but all the major parties in Westminster have ruled this out. Edinburgh may therefore need to issue a new currency or adopt the euro. However, it may be difficult to persuade the other euro-zone members to agree to Scotland acceding to the euro- zone in the near term. And we doubt that Scotland will want to follow in Montenegro\u2019s footsteps by adopting another country\u2019s currency unilaterally as a permanent solution. Either way, there may be a long, damaging impasse before a solution is reached. Of the three regions listed above, only Quebec may face a similar currency dilemma. Flanders and Catalonia already use the euro and we suspect they would remain within the euro-zone if they became independent countries. Insurer Aegon has said it has put in place continency plans for any yes vote, but said it would take some time for the effects of any split to become clear. Adrian Grace, Aegon\u2019s chief executive officer, said: There will be no immediate impact for our customers, but we have developed plans to be put into action at the appropriate time. This includes establishing a new registered life company in England to complement our existing Scottish and English registered companies. This means irrespective of any currency, regulatory or tax change we can continue to serve all our customers. Policies for our non-Scottish customers will continue to be in sterling and we will support any different currency for Scottish based customers. The Scottish Government previously suggested \u2018independence day\u2019 might be in March 2016, allowing an 18 month period for the negotiations to take place and for details to be finalised. Back with the Scottish question, and politicians backing the retention of the Union have seized on news that a number of banks have suggested they would move their head offices south of the border after any yes vote. Better Together leader Alistair Darling said: A flood of banks and financial institutions are now saying that if there is a yes vote then they will have to move business out of Scotland and, in the case of RBS, their headquarters. All Alex Salmond can do is shrug his shoulders and say it doesn\u2019t matter. A few years ago he wanted to keep HQ functions in Scotland. What has changed? All of this is a risk that we don\u2019t have to take. We don\u2019t need to be a separate nation to be a better nation. With more powers guaranteed for Scotland within the stability and security of the UK, why would you take a leap into the unknown with independence. Chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander will be speaking at a Scottish Liberal Democrat rally this evening and he will say: The news today that all of Scotland\u2019s major banks are putting in place contingency plans to relocate their HQ functions is of the utmost seriousness for Scotland. In the short term, jobs and tax revenues would be lost.* But in the longer term, the centre of gravity and decision-making of Scotland\u2019s financial sector would have shifted to a foreign country. This would have the much more profound consequence of the steady erosion of the jobs and prosperity that this sector has brought to Scotland for two centuries. The only brass plate around today is the one that\u2019s been nailed to the coffin of the economic case for separation by Scotland\u2019s largest employers in the last 48 hours. *To be fair, RBS boss Ross McEwan has said in a memo to staff that any head office move would not mean moving operations or jobs. Stock markets have turned lower following weaker than expected US jobs data. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefit unexpectedly rose last week by 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 315,000. This was the highest figure since late June and worse than the 300,000 analysts had been expecting. The figure includes the Labor Day holiday, which probably added to the volatility, but nevertheless it has unsettled investors ahead of next week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, which will reveal the central bank\u2019s latest thinking on the pace of its bond buying programme and the timing of any rise in interest rates. Along with that, markets have begun to take notice of the fact that EU sanctions against Russia over Ukraine come into force tomorrow. And in the UK, of course, there is the uncertainty of next week\u2019s referendum vote. So the FTSE 100 is currently down 55 points or 0.8%, while in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 75 points of 0.44%. In Germany the Dax is down 0.52% while France\u2019s Cac is 0.72% lower. Spain\u2019s Ibex is off 0.85%, also hit by concerns of Catalonia splitting away from the rest of the country if Scotland votes for independence. Time for me to hand over to Nick Fletcher. Thankyou for all your great comments. The boss of Asda has said the supermarket will be forced to split its business if Scotland votes for independence, raising the prospect of higher prices north of the border, writes Jennifer Rankin. John Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield issued a similar warning earlier today. He said: The costs of doing business for most retailers are somewhat higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK but most retailers have one price across the UK. In the event of a yes vote that might change. Andy Clarke, chief executive of Asda, the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket, which has 61 stores north of the border, said if Scotland voted for independence it would be \u201cimperative\u201d to set up a separate Scottish business. If we were no longer to operate in one state with one market and, broadly, one set of rules, our business model would inevitably become more complex. We would have to reflect our cost to operate here.\u201d This is not an argument for or against independence, it is simply an honest recognition of the costs that change could bring. Clarke attended a reception of business leaders at 10 Downing Street on Monday, where prime minister David Cameron urged executives to do everything they could to keep the union together. The supermarket boss said last year that a \u2018yes\u2019 vote would increase pressure on costs, echoing a similar warning from Sainsbury\u2019s. The Better together campaign predicts that the currency chaos that would ensue if Scotland went it alone would cost Scottish families dear. The group says: The governor of the Bank of England has provided written evidence to the Treasury Select Committee that confirms spending cuts or tax rises that would equate to at least \u00a34,000 per person in Scotland to match the currency reserves held by Denmark, which pegs to the euro. This is a conservative estimate and the actual figure could be much higher. To match the currency reserves held by Hong Kong, which pegs to the Dollar, would mean tax rises and spending cuts worth \u00a395 billion - the equivalent of \u00a318,000 per person in Scotland. This means there would need to be huge cuts to public spending on things like our NHS and pensions. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander says: This letter provides further damning evidence of the massive cost to every Scot of going it alone. To match the reserves held by Denmark would cost each of us \u00a34000, but if we had to build up Hong Kong style reserves the cost would be five times greater. In the end, that money would have to be found from every Scots wages, taxes, or the public services like the NHS that we cherish. It is extraordinary that this fundamental issue has not been talked about or thought about by nationalists. With higher costs and fewer businesses paying tax, the price would be paid in higher income tax and less money for the NHS. There is a simple way to avoid these and get the change Scotland needs - vote \u2018no thanks\u2019 next week. Governor Carney\u2019s letter can be read at the following link: http://better.tg/1Bun6k9 RBS boss Ross McEwan has tried to reassure staff that the bank has no intention of moving operations or jobs from Scotland following a Yes vote in next week\u2019s referendum. The bank\u2019s announcement that it would move its head office to London sparked fears for its 11,500 jobs in Scotland. Scotland\u2019s first minister Alex Salmond welcomed McEwan\u2019s pledge, naturally. McEwan said in a memo to staff: This is a technical procedure regarding the location of our registered head office. It is not an intention to move operations or jobs. Our current business in Scotland, including the personal and business bank, IT and operations, human resources and many other functions, are here because of the skills and knowledge of our people, and the sound business environment. So far, I see no reason why this would change should we implement our contingency plans. Finally, a summary of today\u2019s developments. It\u2019s been a busy morning. The pound has strengthened, after hitting a 10-month low against the dollar yesterday. It has drawn some comfort from a poll that showed the no camp is gaining ground again, but analysts say sterling\u2019s outlook remains shaky. The pound rose 0.3% to $1.6266 and to 79.62p against the euro. The FTSE 100 index is down nearly 40 points at 6790.82, a 0.6% fall. Scottish insurer Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group are among the biggest risers. Standard Life, who\u2019s leading the gains, is up 7.3p or 1.8% at 414.7p, while RBS has climbed 4.6p or 1.3% to 346.72p and Lloyds has added 0.7, just under 1%, to 73.9p. RBS, Lloyds, TSB, Tesco Bank, Clydesdale have all threatened to quit Scotland if it votes for independence An independent Scotland would need \u2018huge reserves,\u2019 concludes Treasury Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, on the basis of work done by the Bank of England Next boss Lord Wolfson, John Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield and Aberdeen Asset Management boss Martin Gilbert have become the latest business figures to wade into the Scotland debate Round-up of today\u2019s retail news Treasury Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie also warned about the impact of a potential move out of Scotland by some of its biggest banks, including Lloyds and RBS. The Scottish banking sector as a proportion of the economy is currently huge. To have any reasonable prospect of retaining it, Scotland would need a massive multiple of its inherited reserves. RBS and Lloyds appear to have concluded that this would be unrealistic for Scotland even to attempt and that therefore a separate Scotland could not provide a credible guarantee for deposits. That is probably why RBS and Lloyds have announced that they would move their headquarters following Scottish independence. They would need to protect their customers and shareholders. Alex Salmond has accused the Treasury of leaking market sensitive information about the future of RBS in Scotland in a dirty tricks campaign to undermine the independence campaign, writes our Scotland correspondent Severin Carrell. The first minister said it was an office of \u201cenormous gravity\u201d by an unnamed Treasury official to tip off the BBC last night about a decision by RBS to move its registered office to London after a yes vote. That leak \u2013 confirmed on Thursday morning to the Stock Exchange by RBS, sent the bank\u2019s shares down overnight on the Asian markets, the first minister said. Salmond said he was now demanding a formal leak inquiry by Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the UK civil service, and would be sending in an official complaint today. He also insisted the BBC had a duty to cooperate, implied it was duty bound to reveal its source. So, Mark Carney says \u201cit would not be appropriate for me to judge the apportionment of the UK\u2019s reserves in the event that Scotland were to become an independent state\u201d. The eagerly awaited financial details of what sterlingisation would mean for Scotland turn out to be a series of tables that compare the reserves of various countries with currency pegs as a percentage of broad money, bank deposits and GDP. Helpfully, Treasury Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie\u2019s team has worked out what it means for Scotland \u2013 but the figures range widely from \u00a334bn to \u00a3398bn. At the bottom end, Scotland would need a total of \u00a334bn of reserves to match Denmark\u2019s ratio of reserves to GDP. At the top end, it would need \u00a3389bn of reserves to match Denmark\u2019s ratio of reserves to bank deposits. As Tyrie concludes: \u201cwhatever currency arrangement is chosen, a separate Scotland would require huge reserves\u201d. The (potential) exodus from Scotland is growing: Tesco Bank has become the fifth bank to say it would move its head office from Scotland to England if Scots back independence. The bank, which employs 3,200 people in Scotland, said in a statement on its website: To ensure we provide long term continuity for customers after the transition is complete, our contingency plans include the creation of a new registered company, domiciled in England. While the creation of a new company would change the address of our registered headquarters, we do not expect there would be any immediate impact on colleagues at our existing centres. Scotland is an important market to us and will continue to be an important market regardless of the outcome of the referendum. Tyrie said in response to Carney\u2019s letter: The governor\u2019s letter demonstrates that, whatever currency arrangement is chosen, a separate Scotland would require huge reserves. The Governor noted that \u00a315bn would be at the \u201cupper end of the range\u201d that Scotland might reasonably inherit as reserves. Scotland would need a multiple of that. The comparisons with Denmark and Hong Kong in the Governor\u2019s note say it all. Meeting the shortfall in reserves means that Scotland would, as the Governor also pointed out, face \u2018real fiscal costs\u2019. Scotland\u2019s ability to borrow would be heavily restricted. Obtaining the reserves would mean much higher taxes or lower spending, or both, for years to come. Bank of England governor Mark Carney yesterday added fuel to the debate when he said that an independent Scotland would need to build up billions of pounds worth of currency reserves if it wanted to keep the pound, without a formal currency union. He has sent the Bank\u2019s work on currency sharing schemes to Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury Committee. It\u2019s a fact sheet with a number of tables that summarise the reserves held by countries that use currency boards or fixed peg. The read-across for Scotland varies widely, depending on whether the reserves are expressed as a percentage of GDP, a percentage of bank assets, or a percentage of broad money. Using the Bank of England\u2019s figures, Tyrie\u2019s team worked out that: \u00b7 Scotland would need a total of \u00a3162bn of reserves to match Denmark\u2019s ratio of reserves to broad money. \u00b7 Scotland would need a total of \u00a3389bn of reserves to match Denmark\u2019s ratio of reserves to bank deposits. \u00b7 Scotland would need a total of \u00a334bn of reserves to match Denmark\u2019s ratio of reserves to GDP. \u00b7 Scotland would need a total of \u00a398bn of reserves to match Hong Kong\u2019s ratio of reserves to broad money. \u00b7 Scotland would need a total of \u00a3272bn of reserves to match Hong Kong\u2019s ratio of reserves to bank deposits \u00b7 Scotland would need a total of \u00a3155bn of reserves to match Hong Kong\u2019s ratio of reserves to GDP The figures are calculated by applying Denmark and Hong Kong\u2019s ratio of reserves to money supply, reserves to deposits and reserves to GDP to the money supply, deposits and GDP figures of Scotland. For instance, Denmark\u2019s reserves to GDP ratio is 26% and Scotland\u2019s GDP is \u00a3130bn; thus, to achieve a reserves to GDP ratio equivalent to Denmark\u2019s, Scotland would require reserves totalling \u00a334bn. A top Scottish law firm has moved its money out of Scottish banks for fear that a vote for independence would cause a run, writes Sean Farrell: According to a report in the Lawyer the unnamed firm has shifted its cash because it fears a similar reaction to when Slovak customers moved their savings to Czech banks after Czechoslovakia split in 1993. \u201cWe\u2019re moving our cash to English banks,\u201d a partner at the firm told The Lawyer. \u201cWhen Czechoslovakia split the flow of capital was very quick. \u201cWe bank with all UK banks but we\u2019re making sure all the big money is held in English-registered accounts rather than Scottish ones.\u201d The Lawyer said Scotland\u2019s leading corporate law firms had a slow start to the current financial year because their clients were putting investment and business decisions on hold because of the referendum. Unite has called on Lloyds Banking Group to clarify its position on jobs if Scotland votes for independence next week. A spokesperson from the union\u2019s Scottish headquarters said: The thousands of Unite members working in RBS in Scotland, who have lived with years of job cuts and restructuring, and continue to be concerned about the company\u2019s plans going forward, have been told directly by the chief executive that there is no intention to move operations and jobs, irrespective of what the outcome may be in the independence referendum on September 18. We now urge Lloyds bank to offer the same reassurance. It is vitally important that the people of Scotland can come to their decision over the future of their nation in an atmosphere of calm rationality. Lord Wolfson, the chief executive of Next and a Conservative peer, said the retail group would remain committed to Scotland whatever the outcome of next week\u2019s vote, and refused to come down on one side or the other of the divide. He played down fears of rising costs, but said there was some concern about any new Scottish currency and what would happen to taxes in the case of independence. My colleague Zoe Wood reports: Lord Wolfson, who is a member of George Osborne\u2019s inner circle, said: \u201cWhich ever way the vote goes Next will remain absolutely committed to Scotland, it\u2019s an important part of our business - about 9% of turnover - and what ever happens we will continue to invest in Scotland. \u201cOperationally we don\u2019t forsee any big issues in terms of our systems, our transport, our logisitics - all those things will be very straightforward because we already operate in a separate currency in Eire.\u201d Because the retailer\u2019s warehouse is in Yorkshire, he added that he did not see any \u201cinternal\u201d reason to increase costs. He went on: \u201cWe are concerned about what will happen to the currency because if the new Scottish currency devalues that will push up prices in Scotland. My second worry is taxes: no one can quite understands the financial situation of the new Scottish government will be and whether taxes will remain where they are. The third thing is financial sector jobs where it does look as though some of the big financial players are now talking seriously about having to relocate. There are well paid jobs and unlikely to be replaced with jobs that pay as much. \u201cI think it\u2019s a decision for people in Scotland. The reality is I have customers and staff on both sides of the debate so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for us to come down on one side or the other. \u201cI think all that business can do is be honest and frank about the implications of a yes vote.\u201d Meanwhile Martin Gilbert, head of Aberdeen Asset Management, has said an independent Scotland would be a big success, and would prosper whatever the outcome of the referendum. Here is the statement from TSB in full. Although the implications of Scottish independence remain unclear, it is likely that in the event of a \u201cyes\u201d vote, TSB will establish additional legal entities in England. Any change in TSB\u2019s legal structure would be taken in the interests of our customers and business. In the event of a \u201cyes\u201d vote, it is clear that independence will not happen straight away and there would be a period of time between the referendum and implementation of independence which we expect would provide sufficient time for us to consider and implement any necessary changes. TSB, which was spun off from Lloyds Banking Group last year, has become the fourth bank to say it will move some operations to England if Scots vote for independence, following similar announcements from RBS, Lloyds and National Australia Bank\u2019s Clydesdale. TSB, which has 189 branches and employs almost 2,000 people in Scotland, said it would set up additional legal entities in England. Some 27% of its 4.7m customers are in Scotland. Remember that it was the two Scottish banks - RBS and HBOS (through Lloyds) that required taxpayers bailouts of over \u00a370bn, writes independent City analyst Louise Cooper. It may be viewed as unjust if the whole of the UK picked up the tab to bailout the two Scottish banks only for them to become Scottish in the recovery. Maybe Alex Salmond should be grateful that RBS and Lloyds/HBOS have said they will move south of the border. Westminster may well have given Mr Salmond a \u00a370bn invoice for bailing out the Scottish banks. If Salmond wants the credit of past North Sea oil revenue to be taken into account in Scotland\u2019s new balance sheet, then past debits should be factored in too. John Lewis has warned about keeping its pricing policy the same if Scotland leaves. But what about the Royal Mail? Does its universal service obligation continue of Scotland goes it alone? Or will the Shetland Islands have to pay much closer to the real cost of delivering to them? There are so many implications of Scotland\u2019s independence. Most of which will only be discovered if it happens. I was in Aberdeen for three days at the weekend. A couple of things struck me. Firstly that many people I met were still undecided. Secondly that any No voters were keeping quiet about it as Nationalistic fervour was gaining ground. And thirdly that Scotland does not want to go the way of the divisions of Northern Ireland. The divide seems to be getting deeper and the emotional debate heated. Although clearly the debate in Northern Ireland is religious as well as political, the divisions run deep. I fear for the future of unity within Scotland as the campaign becomes more bitter. There are so many uncertainties in this debate. Not least what happens to various company names? If Scotland votes yes, where does it leave RBS? It cannot continue as Royal Bank of Scotland? Does British Petroleum become the Rest of UK Petroleum? or RUKP? Feel free to send any suggestions of name changes and I\u2019ll tweet the best efforts. The John Lewis chairman has waded into the Scotland debate, warning that prices will go up north of the border if the yes camp wins. As my colleague Sean Farrell reports, Sir Charlie Mayfield said the employee-owned retailer did not intend to reduce its commercial operations in Scotland, where it has nine stores, a contact centre and more than 3,000 employees. But he said that if Scotland votes for independence, retailers are unlikely to spread the higher operating costs of doing business there across the UK as they do now. He also warned there would be economic upheaval in the wake of a yes vote. From a business perspective there will be economic consequences to a Yes vote, not just in uncertainty but some of the turmoil we are hearing about. And it is also the case that it does cost more money to trade in parts of Scotland and therefore those hard costs, in the event of a yes vote, are more likely to be passed on. For various reasons \u2013 regulation and transport costs etc \u2013 it does currently cost more money to serve parts of Scotland. The Bank of England\u2019s analysis of how countries such as Panama use another country\u2019s currency has landed on the desk of Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, my colleague Angela Monaghan reports. The committee is hoping to make it public early this afternoon. It should shed some light on what sterlingisation might mean for an independent Scotland, further fueling the debate. Back to Scotland. Betfair\u2019s Exchange is predicting a victory of the no camp. Whilst a high number of smaller bets have come on yes in recent weeks, the big money trades continue to go on no. The internet betting exchange says: Three-quarters of trades over \u00a32000 have been on NO and two London-based customers have placed bets as high as \u00a319,000 and \u00a322,000 on NO in recent days, just after Scottish opinion polls indicated a big swing to YES. Scottish customers, who make up 20% of the overall participants in the market (compared to just 9% of the UK population), have made a significant number of bets on YES since the weekend, forcing brief contractions in the price. 78% of back bets from Scottish customers were on YES and they now account for 33% of the total back bets on YES whilst placing only 8% of the back bets on NO. But the overall weight of money is still on NO (\u00a34m of the \u00a35m matched), and yesterday\u2019s Survation research for the Daily Record sparked a flurry of activity with NO backed into 1.25 (implying a 80% chance) and YES drifting to 5.0 (a 20% chance). Betfair spokesman James Midmer said: Punters\u2019 betting decisions are formed from a variety of factors, with opinion polls being just one. Whilst the recent YouGov poll sparked a flurry of smaller YES trades the bigger money remained firmly on NO and this was backed up with yesterday\u2019s Survation research for the Daily Record. The trends amongst Scottish customers are interesting, but accuracy can also come from a greater degree of detachment and it\u2019s perhaps worth noting that the betting markets proved a far more accurate judge of the last US election (with no US based customers) than local opinion polls. Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent, reports that debt-burdened people in Northern Ireland owe over \u00a33,000 more to credit card and loan companies compared to those in the rest of the UK. The average level of personal debt is \u00a318,400 in the region, according to Stepchange - the nationwide charity that advises on debt. The UK average is \u00a315,300, Stepchange noted in its survey of 2,000 people across Northern Ireland. It warns that debt owed on pay day loans and to shopping catalogue companies - both high interest - has increased \u201cradically\u201d before and during the age of austerity. StepChange pointed out that unemployment and reduced working hours were the \u201cprimary drivers\u201d of the local debt problem. They said there was a \u201cparticularly worrying trend\u201d among self-employed people in the region who had average debts of \u00a336,000. Part of the reason StepChange says why Northern Ireland consumers are turning to loan companies for finance is because banks in the province are more stringent about lending. The main high street banks in Northern Ireland include two of the Irish Republic\u2019s so called pillar banks, which had to be bailed out with tens of billions of euros from the Irish and European taxpayers. The debt levels are one of the main factors why consumer confidence and high street spend is still low in Northern Ireland compared to other parts of the UK. Analysts at Citi said about sterling: We see limited scope for much of a bounce heading into next week... should we see a \u2018yes\u2019 vote. The next poll is expected around the weekend from Yougov, where markets will watch on the previous \u2018yes\u2019 lead. Turning to the pound, the recent heavy sell-off has abated. Sterling recovered from a 10-month low against the dollar and also gained against the euro today, after a new Scottish poll suggested the \u2018no\u2019 camp is gaining the upper hand again. The poll, conducted by Survation on behalf of the Daily Record, showed 47% intend to vote \u2018yes\u2019 to independence while 53% plan to vote against. The figures exclude 10% of people who were undecided, however. Sterling strengthened 0.2% to $1.6242 against the dollar, after hitting $1.6051 yesterday, its lowest level since mid-November. Against the euro, it traded at 79.630p, well below the euro\u2019s three month high of 80.66p struck yesterday. European stock markets are treading water at the moment. The FTSE 100 index is up nearly 4 points, or 0.05%, at 6833.58. Germany\u2019s Dax has advanced some 14 points, or 0.15%, to 9714.29, while France\u2019s CAC slipped almost 6 points, or 0.13%, to 4445.15. In London, shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group rallied after the banks said they would walk away from Scotland and move to London if the \u2018yes\u2019 camp prevails. RBS gained 5p, or 1.5%, to 347.2p while Lloyds climbed 0.6p, or 0.8%, to 73.81p. The Edinburgh-based insurer Standard Life, which yesterday said it would move parts of its business south of the border, including pensions and investments, was also among the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100. It added 6.1p, or 1.5%, to 413.5p. The Adam Smith Institute published a report in August saying Scotland\u2019s use of the pound without a formal currency union could give it more stability than the rest of the UK. The free-market think tank argued \u201csterlingisation\u201d along with banking reforms could lead to banks taking fewer risks and reduce the risk of future financial crises. Sam Bowman, research director at the institute and the author of the report, said Scotland was \u201calmost uniquely primed for such a system of \u2018adaptive sterlingisation\u201d\u2019. The examples of Panama and other dollarised Latin American economies are proof that countries can thrive when they unilaterally adopt another country\u2019s currency. Combined with a flexible, adaptive banking system, the unilateral use of another country\u2019s currency can instil a discipline in a country\u2019s financial sector that neither a national currency nor a currency union can provide. Scotland\u2019s banking system is almost uniquely primed for such a system of \u2018adaptive sterlingisation\u2019. The path outlined in this paper would go almost unnoticed by the average Scot - until the next big economic shock, when they might just wonder why their system was so much more stable than that of the country they\u2019d left behind. The report noted that this would take Scotland back to the golden days of free banking of the 18th and 19th centuries. Between 1716 and 1844, Scotland had one of the world\u2019s most stable and robust banking systems. It had no central bank, no government-backed lender of last resort, and no bank bailouts. When banks did fail, it was shareholders who were liable for paying back depositors, not taxpayers. The economy flourished. Mark Carney agreed to pass the Bank of England\u2019s work on currency sharing schemes to the Treasury Committee \u201cfirst thing\u201d on Thursday morning, to show what level of reserves are needed. Clearly \u201cfirst thing\u201d means something else to the Bank than it does to the City. We are still waiting, and the Bank\u2019s press office doesn\u2019t know yet when the details will be released. The other big corporate news this morning is that Royal Bank of Scotland would move its head office from Scotland \u2013 where it has been based since 1727 \u2013 to London if Scotland backs independence. The news came after the other bailed-out bank with major operations in Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, revealed last night it would set up legal entities in England to protect its credit rating, as our City editor Jill Treanor reports. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, has looked at the Morrisons numbers. Morrisons may have confounded its doubters by raising its dividend in contrast to Tesco\u2019s recent cut, but there nonetheless remains a tortuous journey to anything resembling a full recovery. There are positive pockets within the update, such as a reduction in net debt, a well funded pension scheme and an improvement in working capital, all of which suggest financial stability. In addition, the company has returned to profitability after the previous full year loss, whilst the dividend hike adds to an existing yield of 6.7%, one of the highest within the FTSE100 and a clear attraction for income seekers. However, like for like sales, underlying and pre-tax profits are all sharply down on the corresponding period last year, the progress quoted in terms of the company\u2019s online and convenience store presence is nascent, whilst the ongoing assault from the discounters continues to crimp margins. There may well be a recovery to come, and within Morrisons\u2019 three year plan significant cash generation and cost savings are forecast. The share price has certainly reflected its difficulties, despite today\u2019s spike, having fallen 40% over the last year, as opposed to a 4% rise in the wider FTSE100. To a large extent, investors\u2019 patience has long since evaporated and the market consensus of the shares as a sell is likely to remain in place for the time being. Nick Bubb says about Ocado: The figures don\u2019t look too bad, with gross retail sales up by 15.5%, although given the amount of extra capacity in the business it is hard to escape the feeling that Ocado should be growing more quickly. CEO Tim Steiner says \u201cThe retail environment is challenging with an increased level of promotional activity and price reductions across the industry. However, due to the strength of our offer, we expect to continue growing sales broadly in line with, or slightly ahead of, the online grocery market\u201d. Well, there are some surprises in how retail shares have reacted to the flurry of results. Morrisons is the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 index, despite posting its worst results in eight years \u2013 presumably because despite the profit drop it is still paying an interim dividend of 4.03% a share, up 5%, and confirmed its to commitment to pay a full-year divi of at least 13.65p. Morrisons shares were up 7.1p, or 4%, at 183.7p in early trading. Next, which reported good results, is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 \u2013 down 145p, or 2%, to 7020p. Perhaps profit-taking? On the FTSE 250, Ocado is the biggest gainer, up 19.4p, or 6.2%, at 331.1p and Argos owner Home Retail is the second-largest faller, down 5p or 2.7% at 182.89p. \u201cWell, \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 has brought us \u201cthe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d in terms of interim profits (best defined as Next, John Lewis Partnership and Morrison\u2019s), but it has also brought a reminder of the power of family shareholders with the return of Will Adderley as CEO of Dunelm...\u201d says independent retail analyst Nick Bubb. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. There is a ton of retail news out this morning, and the Scottish independence referendum \u2013 now seven days away \u2013 still casts a long shadow over financial markets. Bank of England governor Mark Carney yesterday added fuel to the debate when he indicated that an independent Scotland would need to build up billions of pounds worth of currency reserves if it did not agree a currency union with the UK but wanted to keep the pound, as my colleague Graeme Wearden reported. More here. Carney promised to give the Treasury committee some proper financial details on how countries use another country\u2019s currency successfully \u2013 i.e. how sterlingisation would work for Scotland. That\u2019s likely to include details of what currency reserves you\u2019d need as a percentage of GDP, as a percentage of bank assets, and a percentage of broad money. During the hearing, Carney suggested a 25% of GDP figure as a minimum. These details are expected sometime this morning. Let\u2019s turn to retailers. Morrison\u2019s half-year profits more than halved to \u00a3181m, with like-for-like sales excluding fuel and VAT down 7.4% in the first half. The profits are the lowest in eight years. The John Lewis Partnership shrugged off a decline at its Waitrose grocery chain to post an 8.6% rise in underlying first-half profits, on the back of buoyant department store sales. Online grocer Ocado reported gross retail sales up 15.5% in the third quarter but the size of the average order fell amid fierce competition. Fashion chain Next enjoyed a 19.3% rise in first-half profits, as total sales roared 10.3% ahead. Next is outperforming its rivals, notably Marks &amp; Spencer, on the back of strong online sales, a constant stream of new store openings and a foray into new product areas such as homewares and new overseas markets. At Home Retail Group, Argos sales rose 1.2% in the second quarter on a like-for-like basis while Homebase edged 0.1% higher. Homeware retailer Dunelm posted a 7.3% increase in full-year profits. Its chief executive Nick Wharton stepped down with immediate effect and will be replaced by executive deputy chairman Will Adderley.",

But investors seemed taken aback by the idea, worrying that the \"right price\" may be too high and sending Vodafone shares down 1.6p to 203.45p. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 30.49 points lower at 6799.62. The fall accelerated in the afternoon after higher than expected US weekly unemployment claims, ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting. There was continuing uncertainty about the Scottish referendum, despite a new poll showing a majority against independence. The poll for the Daily Record helped Scottish linked shares recover some ground. Energy group SSE added 40p to \u00a314.85, helped by RBC analysts raising their target price from \u00a315 to \u00a315.80. Standard Life climbed 6p to 413.4p, Royal Bank of Scotland rose 3.8p to 346p and Lloyds Banking Group was lifted 0.85p to 74.08, despite both banks saying they might move their headquarters south of the border in the event of a yes vote. Investors were also unsettled by the fact that new EU sanctions against Russia over its role in Ukraine were due to come into effect on Friday, while weaker than expected Chinese inflation figures rekindled fears about the country's economic growth. With China a key consumer of commodities, mining shares were lower, with Fresnillo falling 23p to 819p and Antofagasta down 12p at 767p. Next fell 215p to \u00a369.50 despite a 19.3% rise in first half profits to \u00a3324m and confirmation of its July guidance of a full year profit of \u00a3775m to \u00a3815m. But the figures, impressive as they were, came in slightly below some expectations, and the retailer said part of its strong performance had come from external factors - such as the improving economy, low interest rates and availability of credit - which may not last into next year. But ITV added 4.4p to 216.8p after Credit Suisse moved its target price from 250p to 270p, with an outperform rating. On a busy day for retail results, Argos and Homebase owner Home Retail dropped 13.6p to 174p after like for like sales came in below expectations. Ashmore fell 17.9p or 5% to 327p as the emerging market money manager reported a 34% fall in full year profits to \u00a387.3m, hit by currency fluctuations.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The impact of the growing food price war and a dramatic shift in shopping habits were underlined yesterday as two of the UK's biggest supermarkets revealed a slump in profits. Morrisons' profits dived 51% over the summer after the Bradford-based chain slashed prices on 1,200 items by an average 17% in May. At the same time upmarket Waitrose's operating profits slipped 9.4% as it was also forced to invest in price cuts and store revamps. Ocado's sales increased by 15.5% in the 12 weeks to 10 August as it benefited from the switch to home deliveries. The number of orders placed soared by more than 17% \u2013 but some analysts expressed disappointment about the pace of growth as customers spent less per order \u2013 \u00a3111.64 compared with \u00a3113.54 a year earlier. All the major supermarkets are seeking to hold on to shoppers that are being lured away by the cheap prices of Aldi and Lidl, causing chains such as Asda and Tesco to launch a swath of price cuts on a basket of everyday items. The advance of Aldi was also emphasised as it announced plans to spend \u00a370m on extending its UK headquarters as part of a plan to nearly double its UK stores to 1,000 by 2021, which means more than six store openings a month, every month, for the next six years. The pressure is expected to intensify after Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, brought in a new chief executive, Dave Lewis, who is expected to be much more aggressive on price than his predecessor. Yesterday it emerged that Morrisons is to spend nearly 25% more on price cuts between now and January than it spent during its high profile \"I'm Cheaper\" summer campaign. The supermarket invested \u00a3135m in price cuts and improving products in the first half but has \u00a3165m to play with in the all-important run up to Christmas. The vast majority of that investment is going on price cuts and the rest on improving the quality of own-label foods. Morrisons surprised analysts by increasing its dividend payout by 5%, despite the collapse in its first-half profits. But Dalton Philips, Morrisons' under-pressure chief executive, insisted there was \"a real sense the business is getting back on the front foot\". Profits were just \u00a3181m in the six months to 3 August. Philips said Morrisons had increased its dividend as a \"clear signal of confidence\" in his plan to take on the discounters. He has also extended opening hours. But Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, was unimpressed. He commented: \"This is not everyday low prices driving true [customer] traffic improvements, but desperate marketing activities and creative new measures creating the illusion of green shoots.\" Philips denied Morrisons was \"buying\" sales with heavy voucher campaigns but admitted Morrisons' efforts were unlikely to attract more shoppers or increase sales until at least the end of the year. \"It's still tough, really tough, but there are encouraging signs. We made our calls early and the whole business responded well and we are up for the fight,\" Philips said. Mark Price, Waitrose's boss said its MyWaitrose loyalty card, which offers shoppers a free cup of coffee every time they visit a store, had encouraged shoppers to visit twice as often and spend more each time and this had more than offset the costs of the scheme. He said profits had been hit by new store openings and refits as well as \u00a310m on cutting the price of staples such as milk, eggs and butter. Like-for-like sales at Waitrose rose by just 1.3%, despite a 54% increase in online sales as the chain cut prices and battled to win business in the slowest grocery market for more than a decade.",

      "bodyText": "The chairman of the John Lewis Partnership has warned that prices could increase in Scotland if there is a vote for independence at next week's referendum. Sir Charlie Mayfield said the employee-owned retailer did not intend to reduce its commercial operations in Scotland, where it has nine stores, a contact centre and more than 3,000 employees. But he said that if Scotland voted for independence retailers would be unlikely to spread the higher operating costs of doing business there across the UK as they do now. He warned: \"It's likely that in the event of a yes vote there will be business risks and economic uncertainty. What's happening in the market will clearly be a factor.\" \"The costs of doing business for most retailers are somewhat higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK but most retailers have one price across the UK.

Sir Ian Cheshire, the boss of B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, warned on Wednesday that prices would rise and that business investment would stall after a yes vote and called on other company chiefs to speak out. The John Lewis chairman made his warning as the group said sales had picked up in August after the supermarket price war took its toll on its Waitrose grocery chain in the first half of the year. Pre-tax profits for the six months to 26 July, excluding exceptional items, increased by 11.8% to \u00a3130.6m but were flat when property profits of \u00a311m were excluded. Increased business at the group's department stores made up for falling profits at Waitrose.

The announcement followed news that Lloyds Bank would also move its head office to England and a warning that mortgage lenders are preparing to restrict lending in the event of a yes vote as concerns deepen over the currency that an independent Scotland would use. Treasury sources had indicated on Wednesday night that such a move by RBS was likely after the other bailed-out bank with major operations in Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, revealed it too would set up legal entities in England to protect its credit rating.

The precise amount of reserves needed to back an independent Scotland will depended on the size of the banking sector, at least 10 times the size of Scottish GDP. There had been mounting expectations that banks would shift their registered offices to seek the protection of the Bank of England \u2013 to protect customers and the bank's all-important credit ratings. Carney promised to provide a detailed analysis to the committee on Thursday morning of his comments on the approach taken by other countries. In a statement issued last night, Lloyds \u2013 which owns Bank of Scotland and is 25% owned by taxpayers \u2013 spelled out its contingency arrangements, which would be likely to involve moving its registered office from Scotland, where its Halifax Bank of Scotland business is registered. \"While the scale of potential change is currently unclear, we have contingency plans in place which include the establishment of new legal entities in England,\" it said. \"This is a legal procedure and there would be no immediate changes or issues which could affect our business or our customers,\" added Lloyds, which is the largest private-sector employer in Scotland with 17,000 staff.

On politics you can look at polls, compare statements and promises made prior to the election, and look at the amount of legislation passed, media gaffes etcetera. But judging how the economy has fared under the government requires working out how much impact the government has had \u2013 and that is tricky given how long it takes for a national economy to turn.</p> <p>The reality is in the past year the government hasn\u2019t done much that would have had a significant impact on the economy. Yes it has removed the carbon price and the mining tax, but those two aspects, while figuring prominently in the Liberal party\u2019s economic plan, have occurred too recently for them to have had an impact on anything like economic growth of employment.</p> <p>When we look at employment growth, prior to the 2013 election, monthly employment growth was slowing:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/2pfZ2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>From September to December last year monthly employment growth did increase, so you could say the Abbott government was responsible, but what did they actually do in that time?</p> <p>Nothing.</p> <p>They hardly even sat in parliament let alone passed legislation. The first economic statement from the government only came at the end of December with the release of the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo).</p> <p>And if we do praise them for that growth, what about the past six months in which monthly employment growth has again slowed, and annual growth looks to have hit a plateau?</p> <p>In<a href=\"http://www.petermartin.com.au/2013/04/austerity-why-it-is-suddenly-no-longer.html\"> April last year</a>, Joe Hockey suggested that the election of the Abbott government would spark a boon in confidence \u2013 he<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/election-2013/joe-hockey-to-have-external-auditors-look-into-treasury-forecasts/story-fn9qr68y-1226714677368\"> even told consumers</a> \u201cYou can go forward and spend your hearts out because we\u2019re going to have a good Christmas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/OdtgC/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And we did go out and spend up big, but since December we have closed our wallets, with the quarterly growth in retail spending over the past three months lower than at any point since the September 2012 quarter when there was uncertainty over the introduction of the carbon price.</p> <p>It is not much of a shock to note that the decline in growth of retail spending coincided with Hockey beginning his pre-budget talk. And, not un-coincidentally, that was also when consumer confidence began to fall:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/wMgFg/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Given the great store Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott placed on consumer confidence while in opposition, it is right that we judge them by their own criteria.</p> <p>In December 2011, Hockey<a href=\"http://www.joehockey.com/media/media-releases/details.aspx?r=126\"> stated</a> that fall in that month\u2019s Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment showed that \u201cconsumers have clearly lost confidence in the Labor government\u2019s ability to deliver stable and consistent government.\u201d</p> <p>He also suggested the index showed that \u201cthe government must reassess its plans to introduce both a carbon tax which will increase the price of everything, and a mining tax which will hold back Australia\u2019s most successful export sector.\u201d</p> <p>At that point the index was at 94.6 (where a score over 100 suggests consumers are on balance more confident, and the lower the score the less confident they are).</p> <p>Yesterday, the<a href=\"https://melbourneinstitute.com/downloads/media_release/2014/CSI/PressReleaseCSI20140913.pdf\"> September figures were released</a> showing the index was now at 94.0.</p> <p>It represented a 16.6 point drop in consumer sentiment since the September election. But while it would be easy to suggest this was evidence of the government\u2019s poor performance, it is worth nothing the 12 month fall is less than occurred after the 2010 and 2007 elections:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/C788g/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In fact, since the 1996 election, only twice (1998 and 2001) has consumer sentiment increased in the 12 months after an election.</p> <p>The declines after the 2010 and 2013 elections are for mostly similar reasons \u2013 politics.

      "bodyText": "Reviewing the government\u2019s economic performance over its first year finds them having done little substantial to affect things one way or the other except for delivering a budget amid so much rhetoric of gloom that even Liberal party voters became less confident about the economic situation. It\u2019s always a lot easier judging the political than economic performance of a government in its first year. On politics you can look at polls, compare statements and promises made prior to the election, and look at the amount of legislation passed, media gaffes etcetera. But judging how the economy has fared under the government requires working out how much impact the government has had \u2013 and that is tricky given how long it takes for a national economy to turn. The reality is in the past year the government hasn\u2019t done much that would have had a significant impact on the economy. Yes it has removed the carbon price and the mining tax, but those two aspects, while figuring prominently in the Liberal party\u2019s economic plan, have occurred too recently for them to have had an impact on anything like economic growth of employment. When we look at employment growth, prior to the 2013 election, monthly employment growth was slowing: From September to December last year monthly employment growth did increase, so you could say the Abbott government was responsible, but what did they actually do in that time? Nothing. They hardly even sat in parliament let alone passed legislation. The first economic statement from the government only came at the end of December with the release of the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo). And if we do praise them for that growth, what about the past six months in which monthly employment growth has again slowed, and annual growth looks to have hit a plateau? In April last year, Joe Hockey suggested that the election of the Abbott government would spark a boon in confidence \u2013 he even told consumers \u201cYou can go forward and spend your hearts out because we\u2019re going to have a good Christmas.\u201d And we did go out and spend up big, but since December we have closed our wallets, with the quarterly growth in retail spending over the past three months lower than at any point since the September 2012 quarter when there was uncertainty over the introduction of the carbon price. It is not much of a shock to note that the decline in growth of retail spending coincided with Hockey beginning his pre-budget talk. And, not un-coincidentally, that was also when consumer confidence began to fall: Given the great store Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott placed on consumer confidence while in opposition, it is right that we judge them by their own criteria. In December 2011, Hockey stated that fall in that month\u2019s Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment showed that \u201cconsumers have clearly lost confidence in the Labor government\u2019s ability to deliver stable and consistent government.\u201d He also suggested the index showed that \u201cthe government must reassess its plans to introduce both a carbon tax which will increase the price of everything, and a mining tax which will hold back Australia\u2019s most successful export sector.\u201d At that point the index was at 94.6 (where a score over 100 suggests consumers are on balance more confident, and the lower the score the less confident they are). Yesterday, the September figures were released showing the index was now at 94.0. It represented a 16.6 point drop in consumer sentiment since the September election. But while it would be easy to suggest this was evidence of the government\u2019s poor performance, it is worth nothing the 12 month fall is less than occurred after the 2010 and 2007 elections: In fact, since the 1996 election, only twice (1998 and 2001) has consumer sentiment increased in the 12 months after an election. The declines after the 2010 and 2013 elections are for mostly similar reasons \u2013 politics. Twelve months after the 2010 election, consumer sentiment was bitterly divided over the issue of the carbon tax. In August 2011, ALP voters had a consumer index score of 113.9 compared to Coalition voters who scored just 80.0. This month ALP voters scored 83.4 compared to Coalition voters on 109.5. It\u2019s why consumer confidence can often be more a popularity poll of the government than an actual informed view of the economy \u2013 after the election, Coalition voters magically became more confident about the economy and ALP voters less: What is interesting however is that in the past month the biggest fall in consumer sentiment occurred among Coalition voters, and they are now less confident than they have been at any time since the election. Even more damning though, is that the outlook for the economy over the next five years is at its worst level for 16 years and is down 28.6% on where it was 12 months ago: Despite the deficiencies of the consumer sentiment, for now it is the best indicator of the government\u2019s performance, due to how little the government has actually done. For all the talk of a budget emergency, many of the major cuts and changes in the budget are to occur after the next election. Few if any of the economic positives can be claimed by the government. Last week, for example, the latest industrial disputes data revealed that annual days lost to strikes was below 100,000 for the second quarter in a row \u2013 the best result since 2007-08. But none of that is due to the Abbott government \u2013 the Fair Work Act hasn\u2019t been changed, and legislation to do so is still before the Senate. As a result it also can\u2019t claim any credit for the increase in labour productivity noted in last week\u2019s national accounts. As Stephen Koukoulous noted, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much evidence of a economic plan. With employment dribbling along and little sense that the end of the carbon tax has spurred the confidence the government so assuredly believed would occur, the next year will be the real test for how well this government has handled the economy. If the past 12 months are any guide, the first thing the government should do is stop trying to scare voters and consumers about the economy and try and spread some confidence.",
