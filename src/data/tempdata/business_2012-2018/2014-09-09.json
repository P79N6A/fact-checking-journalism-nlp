      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest energy firms have agreed to refund more than \u00a3153m to 3.5 million domestic customers after the cash accumulated in closed accounts over the past six years, the industry body announced today. The energy regulator Ofgem this year ordered the big six gas and electricity suppliers to hand the money back after consumer groups complained it was \"shocking\" that they had kept such large sums. British Gas owner Centrica, SSE, ScottishPower, E.On, EDF and npower had a total of more than \u00a3400m left in an estimated 3.5 million domestic and 300,000 business accounts after people and firms had moved or switched suppliers. The average domestic balance is about \u00a350 and the industry has also committed to hand back the cash from business accounts. Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem, said the announcement by Energy UK was \"an encouraging first step by the six largest energy companies to address Ofgem's call to reunite customers with their cash. It is good news for consumers and if you think you could be owed money we recommend that you contact your previous supplier.\" He said the commitment was part of a wider challenge of delivering good customer service \"that the industry must crack if they are to rebuild customer trust and confidence\". He added: \"Suppliers must now do everything within their powers to return the money and prevent a similar situation from happening again. Failure to deliver on the initiatives announced today could trigger further action by Ofgem, including enforcement.\" In February Ofgem said that where balances cannot be returned to individuals they should be used in a way that would benefit consumers more widely. Suppliers were also told they must prevent similar buildups of funds in the future. Minimum voluntary standards are being introduced to make the way credit balances are handled smoother, claims faster and to minimise how much money is left behind. However, from 2016, if cash is unclaimed after two years it will be used to help vulnerable customers struggling to pay bills. Suppliers are starting this process by donating \u00a338m for the first two years. Amber Rudd MP, minister for energy and climate change said: \"This government is committed to helping hard-pressed consumers with the cost of energy bills. People should rightly be returned money that is theirs and was left behind when they moved house or switched.\" Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, said: \"We are urging former customers to come forward and make a claim. Customers who think they haven't left a forwarding address or a final meter reading when they moved or switched should contact their old supplier. The website www.myenergycredit.com will help you do this.\"",

      "bodyText": "Two top City regulators were lambasted by MPs on Tuesday for failing to respond to requests for information, with the warning that parliamentarians were \"fed up\" with their attitude. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, warned the two bosses of the Financial Conduct Authority that there was deep disquiet with their approach. \"I'd like to say this is likely to be the last soft ball hearing on this. We're fed up. There is deep disquiet about the slow and apparently obstructive approach we've had on a number of issues,\" Tyrie told John Griffith-Jones, chairman of the FCA. Griffith-Jones, who said he was very keen to resolve their differences, was giving evidence alongside Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA. John Thurso, a Liberal Democrat MP on the committee, cited three main issues of contention: information requested about how the regulator had reached agreement with banks over payouts for mis-selling interest rate swaps; receiving internal audits from the regulator; and legal advice on whether a specific type of interest rate swap was regulated. Griffith-Jones said there were issues of confidentiality involved in providing some of the information demanded. Wheatley was also asked whether the regulator was confident it had solved the way banks were fixing the prices of financial instruments in the wake of the Libor fixing scandal, which erupted in 2012 when Barclays was fined \u00a3290m for its role in manipulation of the benchmark rate. He said: \"We have not solved it yet. It's still a work in progress.\" The fair markets review set up by the chancellor, George Osborne, was looking at what areas might need to be covered by regulation, Wheatley said. He added that the investigation into foreign exchange manipulation was continuing and that all the banks were embarrassed by the continued scandals sweeping the industry. He defended the level of fines being imposed by the regulators, which he said were \"not at a level that represents systemic risk to any of the institutions\" and were also discussed with the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority. Top investor Neil Woodford said this month that he was selling all his shares in Britain's largest bank HSBC because of \"fine inflation\" which was making investing in the bank too risky. The chairman of HSBC, Douglas Flint, had warned that the threat of fines from regulators was making banks risk averse as staff became cautious in an attempt to avoid penalties from regulators. Flint described an \"observable and growing danger of disproportionate risk aversion\". Two years ago the bank was fined \u00a31.2bn by the US for breaching sanctions and allowing Mexican drug lords to launder money through the financial system. Wheatley was asked about anti-money laundering rules, which have sparked complaints from ordinary customers caught up in the new restrictions. Wheatley said this was \"a response to the some of the things going on in the US\". \"The cost of getting it wrong are so high banks want to get themselves out of that risk,\" said Wheatley. \"The banks have consistently failed to spot the high risk individuals they should not be banking,\" he added. After the hearing Tyrie said: \"We need money laundering regulations that work, not just a back-covering exercise. Millions of people are already put to trouble as a result of these regulations.\" The regulators were also asked about \"dark pools\" through which professionals trade shares while avoiding stock exchanges. Wheatley said the 12 dark pools operating in the UK would be monitored. Barclays is fighting penalties from a US regulator over the way it operated its dark pool. The New York attorney general has accused the bank of fraud for the way the dark pool was marketed to clients. Dark pools are highlighted in the book Flash Boys by best selling author Michael Lewis, which claims that high-frequency traders have rigged the stock market by taking advantage of systems not available to others. Barclays has argued that the accusations by the US regulator contain factual errors.",

The broader trade in goods and services deficit also widened in July, to \u00a33.3bn from \u00a32.5bn in June. The Office for National Statistics data showed a larger goods deficit in July driven by a \u00a31.3bn rise in imports to \u00a334.2bn, outpacing a \u00a3500m increase in exports to \u00a324bn. Rising imports of fuel, chemicals and aircraft drove the deficit higher, while the rise in exports was driven by oil trade with non-EU countries and pharmaceutical exports. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank estimated separately that the UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to the end of August, suggesting the rate of growth is starting to slow. Despite the disappointing trade figures, which underline the challenge the chancellor is facing in his ambition to rebalance the economy away from domestic consumer demand and towards exports, there was slightly better news for manufacturing output which increased by 0.3% in July, in line with expectations.

Underlining these challenges is the fact that income inequality continues to widen across the G20 countries.</p> <p>\u201cThe G20 commitment to boost GDP by more than 2% by 2018 over and above the baseline projections is certainly a welcome step, although it will be important to ensure that this additional growth is job-rich and inclusive.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Full story here: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/09/g20-report-world-jobs-market\">G20 handed gloomy jobs market report</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-540eb4b3e4b0f4333c5dc3ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-09T08:16:27.821Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Euro hits 14-month low against the dollar</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Elsewhere in the currency markets, the euro has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar since July 2013, at trading at $1.2860</strong>.</p> <p>The euro has been weakening since last Thursday, when the European Central Bank cut interest rates and announced a new asset-purchase scheme to fight deflation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chrisadamsmkts/statuses/509251241026007040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Euro hits 14 month low of $1.2860 against dollar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Draghi?src=hash\">#Draghi</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ECB?src=hash\">#ECB</a></p>&mdash; Chris Adams (@chrisadamsmkts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisadamsmkts/status/509251241026007040\">September 9, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-540eb218e4b0ce3d9c4800e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-09T07:58:40.776Z\">8.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Analysts at BNP Paribas</strong> also reckon that the pound will be buffeted by the twists and turns in the referendum battle in coming days: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWe expect political concerns surrounding the September 18 Scottish independence referendum to dominate price action.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>(<em><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/british-pound-under-pressure-ahead-of-scottish-independence-vote-1410248719?mod=wsj_nview_latest\">via the WSJ</a></em>).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-540eae96e4b0678f1b1107a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-09T07:47:36.502Z\">8.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound\u2019s weakness is partly due to the strength of the US dollar, which hit a six-year high against the Japanese yen overnight.</p> <p>But while today\u2019s drop in sterling is pretty mild, it continues a trend that began in mid-July.

      "bodyText": "A drop in the oil price, partly due to worries about a demand shortfall if global economic growth slows, EU sanctions on Russia, talk of a possible US Federal Reserve rate hike sooner than the market expects and - in the UK - the continuing uncertainty over the Scottish referendum all combined to send European markets lower, writes Nick Fletcher. The pound slipped below $1.61 as the yes vote continued to put in a strong showing in the polls, while Spanish ten year bond yields rose 12 basis points to 2.192% on talk that any Scottish independence victory could strengthen other separatist movements, not least in Spain\u2019s wealthy Catalonia region. Overall the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 5.77 points or 0.08% lower at 6829.00 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.49% to 9710.70 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.5% at 4452.37 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.68% to 21,149.80 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.36% down at 10,951.6 (presumably the Catalan effect) In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 58 points or 0.34%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Mark Carney declared during his Q&amp;A that the Bank of England pays no attention to politics when setting interest rates. But Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon UK, isn\u2019t convinced, and reckons there\u2019s little chance of a rate rise this year: \u201cMark Carney may have told the TUC today that we should get ready for an interest rate rise, but unless a \u2018yes\u2019 vote in Scotland causes a serious shock to Sterling, it\u2019s hard to see this happening before Spring next year. The Bank of England will be wary of attracting perceptions of political bias ahead of the election, and the snail\u2019s pace of wage growth, a key concern for the TUC, presents a thorn in the side of those wanting the base rate to increase.\u201d Here\u2019s some reaction to Mark Carney\u2019s declaration that a currency union \u201cis incompatible with sovereignty\u201d, from David Nicholls, alliance manager at UKForex: \u201cThe \u201cYes\u201d camp continues to call Westminster\u2019s bluff by insisting they will be able to keep the pound in the event of independence. It\u2019s a dangerous game to play, and even Mark Carney appears to be warning against any complacency in this afternoon\u2019s statement. There is no clear answer on currency for an independent Scotland, and if the polls remain tight, we will see an extended period of uncertainty for the pound as a result\u201d Britain\u2019s recovery has slowed over the summer, according to the latest growth forecast from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR estimated that GDP grew by 0.6% in the three months to August. And it has also lowered its estimate for growth in May-July, to +0.5%. That suggests that growth in the third quarter of 2014 will not match the 0.8% expansion recorded in the second quarter, unless activity accelerates in September. On an annual basis, NIESR reckons the UK economy has grown around 2.9% since August 2013. Back in Scotland, the boss of B&amp;Q has warned that prices could rise if Scotland votes for independence. Sir Ian Cheshire, CEO of Kingfisher, told Sky News today that separation would mean increased costs for Scottish businesses, which would then be born by customers north of the border. Cheshire said: \u201cWe think there is a real risk in terms of higher costs, the uncertainty about a currency union and the difficulty of making investment decisions,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cSmaller, more complex markets often mean passing higher costs on to consumers. \u201cInvestment decisions would be on pause while we work out what\u2019s likely to happen. \u201cWe are not going to pick up stores and move them south of the border but [a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote] would represent real and significant challenge for our business.\u201d Our Scotland correspondent, Severin Carrell, explains that claims by the no campaign that Scottish consumers would face higher costs in high street stores and the major chains after independence are controversial: Better Together printed a notional Tesco till receipt in its campaign leaflets. Based on Tesco\u2019s higher prices in Ireland, it claimed prices in Scotland would rise by 16% after independence, because supermarkets would no longer treat its Scottish stores as part of its UK chain and price goods to reflect the real costs of selling them in a smaller market. A Tesco customer relations manager told one Scottish voter who raised this claim \u201cI can confirm that this is not true\u201d. Tesco would \u201ccontinue to offer the best prices whatever the outcome of the referendum\u201d. It added that some prices in Ireland were actually lower than in the UK. The Scottish independence battle is having an impact on the rest of Europe, fuelling speculation that other regions could seek sovereignty. The prospect that Catalonia could renew its push for independence has pushed down the value of Spanish government debt today. This sent the yield on its 10-year bonds jumping to 2.21%, from 2.08% last night. The pound has now slipped back to $1.61, slightly lower than yesterday\u2019s close. Scotiabank suggests that sterling\u2019s immediate slump could now be over, at least until the referendum has been held on September 18. Mark Carney\u2019s Liverpool speech appears to have been well-received, especially his comments about how British pay packets have born the brunt of the economic pain since the financial crisis began. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has just issued this statement: \u201cMark Carney recognised the pain felt by British workers from pay cuts deeper than any since the 1920s, and he was clear that Britain deserves a pay rise. \u201cHis strong support for the living wage, not least by making the Bank of England an accredited living wage employer, should be heard across government and the public sector. \u201cAnd his caution on interest rates may have been carefully phrased, but showed he understood the worries of households hit by the living standards squeeze.\u201d Mark Carney has pretty much ruled out an interest rate rise this year, given his comments on pay, reckons Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He says: It is notable that the Governor commented that \u201cwe will be closely monitoring pay settlements that are bunched around the turn of the year and taking a steer from the pay of new hires as a potential leading indicator of pay pressures\u201d. This suggests that most Monetary Policy Committee members want to see concrete evidence that pay is starting to pick up before raising interest rates. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has just told the Trades Union Congress in Liverpool that an independent Scotland could not have a currency union with the rest of the UK and also enjoy full sovereignty. He was asked by a delegate whether an Scotland could keep the pound in a currency union if it votes for independence next week. Carney replied by reminding the TUC of the speech he gave in Edinburgh in January, in which he outlined the Bank\u2019s position on this issue. There are three components of a successful currency union, he says: First, you have to have free movement of capital and labour and goods and services, trade, across the various parts of the currency union. Secondly, you need a banking union. You need the same regulation, the same supervision, the same standards in the banking sector, and very importantly you need the same institutions that stand behind those banks. The lender of last resort, which is a central bank, and a deposit guarantee scheme that is credible. You need all those institutions. And thirdly, you need some form of fiscal arrangement. You need tax, revenues and spending flowing across those borders to help equalise, to an extent, some of the inevitable differences [across the Union]. We only need to look across the Channel to see what happens if you don\u2019t have all of those components in place, the governor says. That\u2019s just the economics of it. Carney then concludes: We take note of the positions of all the major Westminster parties to rule out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK. In that context, a currency union is incompatible with sovereignty.  On skills, Mark Carney says \u201cthere is nothing worse than wasting human capital.... wasting a life, wasting skills.\u201d What impact is the boom of zero hours contracts having? Carney says the Bank looks past the topline unemployment rate, to issues such as part-time work, self-employment, to show how much slack remains. A question on tax evasion, and whether the tax system should be more redistributive? Mark Carney declines to comment directly on fiscal policy - he can\u2019t give views on taxation. But he does signal that pay inequality is a major issue for the Bank of England. The shift of wage growth - faster at the top end, and tepid (or worse) at the low end, affects monetary policy and we need to understand that, says Carney. It comes back to \u201cwho has the debts in the economy, who has the ability to service those debts\u201d, and what does that mean to the recovery. And he pledges that the BoE will do what it can do to ensure durable wage growth for all. What can the Bank do about the \u2018unsustainable growth\u2019 in house prices? Carney says that the Bank\u2019s macro-prudential tools allow it to control the market without having to raise interest rates. But the BoE cannot solve the supply problems. We can\u2019t build more houses. What impact does politics have on monetary policy, and when the Bank will raise interest rates? We are absolutely indifferent to the political cycle, Mark Carney replies. We have a specific mandate. Basically unchanged since 1997, to achieve that 2% inflation target. If we need to raise rate, or lower them, before the May 2015 election to achieve the target, we will do what\u2019s necessary. We are technocrats, he insists. What is the Bank of England doing to encourage banks to support to the real economy? Carney replies that it is much more expensive for the banks to engage in City trading rather than to lend to the real economy. These are \u201clumbering institutions\u201d, it takes them a long time to adjust, but they need to lend more to the real economy, to the creative industries, he adds. The questions from the TUC delegates are being bundled together. On household indebtedness.... Carney says he welcomed the focus on this issue. We see through surveys that 40% of households feel \u201cacutely\u201d the impact of their indebtedness. It\u2019s one of the factors that influences monetary policy. What is important, he explains, is that there is a promise of wage increases to reduce that indebtedness. As the extra workforce finds employment, as the slack is used up, we start to see those prospects. The first questions to Mark Carney focus on the public sector pay freeze - what impact will weak wage rises in the public sector have on economic stability? The Bank of England governor says it is a very important issue. It is one of the reasons why we are very conscious about the pace and degree of potential interest rate increases, he tells the TUC. This is something that we are taking very seriously. It is one of the reasons we acted on housing earlier this year. In an environment of low wage growth, strong house price inflation could store up problems in the future, Carney adds. Thus the new affordability measures brought in by the Bank. Mark Carney finished his speech, as flagged up earlier, by declaring that UK firms and workers must deliver skills and productivity improvements \u201cso that the British people get the pay rise they deserve.\u201d Now onto questions.... Another angle on Scottish independence, from Citi. Carney says the Bank of England will be watching pay deals closely, to see if the recovery is feeding through to workers\u2019 pockets. And on interest rates, Carney says that borrowing costs will not return to their pre-crisis levels, even once the Bank of England starts to hike. Mark Carney is now explaining to the TUC that the Bank was right not to raise interest rates already, even when inflation was over target. We understood that there was plenty of spare capacity in the labour market, and that the recovery was fragile. Our forward guidance (his forward guidance, really) encouraged firms to invest and hire, Carney declares. Now, the recovery has exceeded expectations, and our job is to ensure it is durable and lasting, he says. Reminder, the speech is here. Mark Carney\u2019s promise to make the Bank of England a living wage-payer within the year went down well with the TUC.... Mark Carney\u2019s speech to the TUC runs to 12 pages, plus charts. And Congress is running late, so it\u2019s not started yet. But his key point is that Britain\u2019s workers need a pay rise, but they\u2019ll need to deliver improved productivity to deserve it: Here\u2019s his conclusion: We are under no illusions. The Great Recession was a calamity. Britain\u2019s workers have borne many of the consequences. Our job is to ensure the economy achieves its potential and to maintain price and financial stability, for sustainable growth in jobs and incomes. But monetary policy cannot do it alone. Others \u2013 including trade unions, government and businesses \u2013 will determine the potential of this economy. You will ultimately determine the size of Britain\u2019s pay rise. Those in work need to be able to seize new job opportunities in a world where technology and globalisation cause labour markets to shift rapidly. Skill levels need to be raised continually. That is of course first and foremost about education. But crucially it also means access to lifelong learning, both on and off the job, available to all. The TUC\u2019s engagement with the UK\u2019s skills agenda is a major contribution to realising that imperative. In the past year alone, unionlearn, has supported over 200,000 people to invest in their skills. Such investments are crucial for the durability of this economic expansion and for Britain\u2019s future. They will help to deliver long-term productivity \u2013 so that the British people get the pay rise they deserve. And here are some charts: Mark Carney also indicates that UK wages will finally rise above inflation in the middle of next year. In early 2014, there were hopes that real wages could turn positive this year, but recent weak earnings figures have dashed those hopes. Mark Carney has also given the TUC a clear signal that UK interest rates could start to rise next spring, to meet the Bank of England\u2019s mandate of ensuring price stability. He says that TUC members \u201ccan expect interest rates to begin to increase\u201d, even though there are few signs of inflationary pressures now. With inflation at 1.6%, continuing downward pressure from the appreciation of sterling, and with slack remaining, the current inflation environment is benign. But it will not remain benign if we do not increase interest rates prudently as the expansion progresses. Our latest forecasts show that, if interest rates were to follow the path expected by markets \u2013 that is, beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very gradually \u2013 inflation would settle at around 2% by the end of the forecast and a further 1.2 million jobs would have been created. In other words, we would achieve our mandate. That has given the pound a little lift, to $1.613 against the US dollar. Over in Liverpool, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is due to begin speaking at the Trades Union Congress. His speech has just been released, and the first piece of news is that the Bank of England aims to become an accredited Living Wage employer within the year. That means all staff will receive at least \u00a37.65 per hour, or \u00a38.80 per hour in London. Carney says a living wage is an issue of \u201chuman dignity\u201d: The growth and distribution of jobs and incomes matter to everyone. Employment does much more than provide the means to support workers and their families; it is essential to personal fulfilment and human dignity. Part of that dignity is being paid a living wage. Over the past year, the Bank of England has ensured that its pays all of its 3,600 staff at least the living wage. And we have recently brought all our contracted service staff in central London up to the London living wage. We are in the process of our final review. But I can announce today the Bank\u2019s intention to become an accredited Living Wage employer by the time of the next TUC conference. More to follow... Heads-up. Just under 15 minutes until Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, begins speaking at the TUC conference in Liverpool..... Data firm Markit reckons that Scotland\u2019s economy has lagged the UK average over the last year. It poll companies across the globe each month to assess the latest activity, output, employment and export figures. https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/status/509281525612150784 The head of Thales Group, one of Britain\u2019s largest defence suppliers, has warned that jobs and investment on both side of the border could be hit if Scotland votes to leave the United Kingdom. Jean-Bernard Levy, CEO of France\u2019s Thales, has told Reuters a \u2018yes\u2019 vote could fuel uncertainty. Speaking at a defence conference in southwest France, Levy said a yes vote would \u201cinevitably\u201d mean an investment freeze. An \u201camputated Britain\u201d without Scotland would raise questions, he added. Levy told Reuters that: \u201cIt is very difficult to make any sort of predictions, (but) it is clear that if it is cut off from Scotland, the rest of Great Britain will have fewer resources to devote to defence and this will inevitably lead us to re-examine our industrial framework,\u201d \u201dThere would be questions over the capabilities we keep in the UK and there would also be questions over the facilities we maintain in Scotland,\u201d Thales is Britain\u2019s second-largest defence contractor, with 7,500 employees. That includes around 500 at Govan, Glasgow, where it makes submarine periscopes for the Royal Navy. Back to the Scottish independence vote. And over in Parliament, the head of the Financial Conduct Authority has told the Treasury Committee that \u201ccontingency plans\u201d are underway in case the pro-independence side win on September 18. The better-than-expected UK industrial production data (see 9.35am) has pushed the pound back over the $1.61 mark, having hit a 10-month low this morning. This morning\u2019s data shows Britain has a long way to go to return its industrial sector to its pre-crisis state, says business retail bank Aldermore: And here\u2019s more details of how Britain\u2019s imports and exports with major trade partners changed in July: This chart shows how the deficit in Britain\u2019s trade in goods with the European Union, and with the rest of the world, both deteriorated in July: Disappointing news on UK trade, again. Britain\u2019s deficit of goods with the rest of the world has widened unexpectedly in July, to \u00a310.2bn. That\u2019s up from \u00a39.4bn in June, worse than expected. And although Britain recorded a \u00a36.8bn surpluses on services, that wasn\u2019t enough to prevent the trade deficit widening to \u00a33.3bn in July 2014, from \u00a32.5bn in June. Imports rose by \u00a31.3bn, outpacing the \u00a3500m increase in exports, dashing hopes that Britain\u2019s economy might be rebalancing. The ONS reports that trade in goods with non-EU countries accounted for the majority of the increase in exports and imports in July 2014, suggesting that demand from the eurozone was weak. Details and reaction to follow... The ONS confirms that industrial production is still 11.3% below its pre-crisis peak, in the first quarter of 2008. The manufacturing sector is 7.6% smaller. UK industrial production is up by 1.7% over the last year, the ONS reports. That annual increase was driven by: rubber, plastic products &amp; other non-metallic mineral products; the manufacture of transport equipment; and the manufacture of basic metals &amp; metal products. The 0.5% monthly increase in production in July was mainly due to increased energy production (electricity, gas, steam &amp; air conditioning). But as this chart shows, the sector is still below its pre-crisis peak: Just in : UK industrial production has posted its biggest rise since February. Industrial production rose by 0.5% month-on-month in July, a stronger reading than the 0.2% which economists had expected. The manufacturing sector also grew its output by 0.3%, the Office for National Statistics reported, broadly as forecast. City investors are dashing to insure themselves against losses from the pound\u2019s volatility over the next month. The cost of hedging against further sterling weakness just hit its highest since late 2011 on Tuesday, following the latest polls showing the independence race is too close to call. STERLING/DOLLAR ONE-MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY HITS 10.105 PERCENT, HIGHEST SINCE NOV 2011, ON SCOTLAND WORRIES There is another gloomy assessment of the world\u2019s jobs market this morning. The International Labour Organisation, the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have produced a labour market update for the G20 employment and labour ministers\u2019 meeting in Melbourne, my colleague Katie Allen reports. It highlights that \u201clarge employment gaps remain in most G20 countries\u201d, referring to grouping of the world\u2019s biggest developed and emerging market economies. The authors also worry that \u201cthe quality of employment remains a concern\u201d and that \u201cthe deep global financial and economic crisis and slow recovery in many G20 countries has resulted not only in higher unemployment but also in slow and fragile wage gains for G20 workers.\u201d The paper concludes: \u201cSeven years after the onset of the global financial and economic crisis, the economic recovery may be strengthening but remains weak and fragile. The employment challenges across most G20 countries are still very sizeable both in terms of a persistently large jobs gap and low quality of many available jobs. The current growth trajectory, if unchanged, will not create enough quality jobs \u2013 giving rise to the risk that the jobs gap will remain substantial, underemployment and informal employment will rise, and sluggish growth in wages and incomes will continue to place downward pressure on consumption, living standards and global aggregate demand. Underlining these challenges is the fact that income inequality continues to widen across the G20 countries. \u201cThe G20 commitment to boost GDP by more than 2% by 2018 over and above the baseline projections is certainly a welcome step, although it will be important to ensure that this additional growth is job-rich and inclusive.\u201d Full story here: G20 handed gloomy jobs market report Elsewhere in the currency markets, the euro has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar since July 2013, at trading at $1.2860. The euro has been weakening since last Thursday, when the European Central Bank cut interest rates and announced a new asset-purchase scheme to fight deflation. Analysts at BNP Paribas also reckon that the pound will be buffeted by the twists and turns in the referendum battle in coming days: \u201cWe expect political concerns surrounding the September 18 Scottish independence referendum to dominate price action.\u201d (via the WSJ). The pound\u2019s weakness is partly due to the strength of the US dollar, which hit a six-year high against the Japanese yen overnight. But while today\u2019s drop in sterling is pretty mild, it continues a trend that began in mid-July. Since then, the pound has shed 10 cents against the US dollar, a significant move. Away from the frenzy in Scotland, the London stock market has opened calmly, although events north of the border continue to dominate attention. Scottish bank shares are recovering from yesterday\u2019s selloff. Lloyds Banking Group are up 1.8%, and RBS has gained 0.9%. But SSE (formerly Scottish and Southern Energy), has shed another 0.5% in early trading. James Knightley of ING says a yes vote would create: ...economic and political uncertainty that will potentially be damaging for both growth and asset prices. But right now, the FTSE 100 is up just 7 points, or 0.1%. Here\u2019s the top risers: This chart showing how the Yes campaign has chased down Alistair Darling\u2019s \u2018No\u2019 campaign in recent weeks (with thank to Berenberg bank). Despite the latest polls, many City economists reckon that the No campaign will stagger over the line in first place on September 18. Parallels are drawn with Quebec, which narrowly voted against splitting from Canada in 1995 after a nail-biter of a race. Rob Wood of Berenberg says: Voters may find it harder to support change in the polling booth than when talking to a pollster. Notwithstanding these arguments, the pace of poll tightening is raising the risk that Scotland does plump for independence. Recent polling evidence suggests, in fact, that the more Scottish voters hear about the independence debate, the more likely they are to vote for it. I suspect they\u2019ll be hearing about little else for the next couple of weeks, at least... The prospect of Scotland going it alone has spooked investors at a time when they were already worried about the weak European economy. Jonathan Sudaria, dealer at Capital Spreads, says: The economic outlook from the continent still remains weak and the potential fallout from the Scottish Independence vote still drapes uncertainty over the UK.\u201d Westminster\u2019s pledge to devolve more powers in a \u201cmodern form of Scottish home rule\u201d is unlikely to prevent the pound falling further, reckons Stan Shamu of IG. He predict more volatility in the run-up to the independence referendum on 18 September: Until a concrete plan emerges and we get more clarity of a shift in momentum in the polls, cable is likely to remain under pressure. Until then, there is a good chance we\u2019ll see cable extend its losses and could even test $1.6000 in the near term. The pound has fallen to a fresh 10-month low overnight as the prospect of Scotland voting for independence next week sends reverberations around the financial markets. Sterling fell as low as $1.6066 in early trading today, down from the $1.6137 set at 5pm yesterday at the end of a dramatic day\u2019s trading. The selloff was fuelled by a new opinion poll, released at midnight, which found that the two sides in the Scottish referendum are neck-and-neck. TNS reported that the no side\u2019s support has slipped to 39%, down from 45% last month.Yes\u2019s support has surged to 38%. from 32%. And among those certain to vote, \u201cNo\u201d and \u201cYes\u201d are tied on 41% each. The poll puts new pressure on companies and investors to draw up contingency plans in the event of a \u201cYes\u201d vote next week. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it this morning: Any increase in political or economic uncertainty is always likely to make investors nervous, and a Scottish \u201cYes\u201d vote would create this in spades, which suggests we will continue to see further market weakness, due to the numerous unknowns, if the polls continue to move in the \u201cYes\u201d camps favour. The TNS poll was taken before Gordon Brown weighed into the battle with a promise to offer new powers to Scotland if it rejects independence. That pledge, though, hasn\u2019t yet given the pound any relief. Reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. The Scottish referendum looms over the markets today, after the pound and shares in Scottish companies tumbled yesterday. Sterling\u2019s weakness has raised the prospect that UK interest rates could stay at record lows for longer. Something for Bank of England governor Mark Carney to ponder on his way to Liverpool. Carney is speaking at the TUC\u2019s annual conference, from 11.45am BST today. On the economic front, we get the latest UK trade and industrial/manufacturing data, at 9.30am. That could also give the pound a jolt. And at 3pm, the NIESR thinktank will publish its estimate for UK growth in the three months to August. European stock markets are expected to lose ground this morning, as the prospect of fresh sanctions against Russia weigh on shares. EU governments agreed new measures overnight, but it\u2019s not clear when they will be implemented. I\u2019ll be tracking the main developments through the day.",

    "webTitle": "Wonga hires insurance firm executive to help restore tattered reputation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest payday loans company, Wonga, has hired an executive from the insurer RSA to help restore its tattered reputation. Tara Kneafsey, a former management consultant who has been with RSA for eight years, has been charged with helping the recently appointed chairman, Andy Haste, to \"re-present Wonga to the public\". The appointment follows vociferous criticism of the loans company's business model and the recent scandal involving fake legal letters designed to pressure borrowers to pay back their loans. Kneafsey, 39, will run the UK consumer division, working alongside Haste to ensure Wonga \"lends only to customers who can reasonably afford to repay their loans\", said a spokesman. She will also be reviewing its advertising strategy. One of Haste's first announcements on taking up the reins in July was that the controversial grandparent puppets used in the company's TV adverts would be dropped as part of an attempt to clean up Wonga's act. Founded in 2006, Wonga has long come under fire for its sky-high rates \u2013 it offers short-term loans at an annualised interest rate of 5,853%. The Church of England has condemned the company as \"morally wrong\" and pledged to compete the industry out of existence by boosting credit unions, while politicians such as Labour's Stella Creasy have labelled its activities \"legal loan sharking\". But the company suffered its biggest blow in June when the Financial Conduct Authority found it guilty of unfair and misleading debt-collection practices, including sending letters to struggling borrowers in the names of made-up law firms \"Barker &amp; Lowe\" and \"Chainey, D'Amato &amp; Shannon\". Wonga was ordered to pay compensation of more than \u00a32.6m to about 45,000 customers. A few days before the FCA announcement, it emerged that one of Wonga's founders, Errol Damelin, had quit as a director of the company, seven months after stepping down as chief executive. Weeks earlier, Niall Wass, who replaced Damelin as chief executive last November, announced he was quitting. Kneafsey, who will start her job as managing director of Wonga's UK consumer loans business later this year, indicated the scale of the challenge ahead, saying: \"It is clear the business needs to evolve significantly to become an accepted part of the financial services landscape.\" She added: \"I am pleased to be joining Wonga at such a pivotal time for its UK business. There is undoubtedly a genuine demand for short-term credit.\" Haste said Kneafsey had \"a proven record in putting businesses on the right track\" and would be instrumental in \"returning Wonga to its original vision \u2013 providing short-term loans to the right customers in a responsible and transparent way\". Kneafsey's very first job was as a cashier in an amusement arcade \u2013 in a 2012 interview she claimed she \"became a bit too good at gambling on the poker machines\" \u2013 and she studied physics to master's level. She started her career as a management consultant before joining RSA in 2006, and most recently led the insurer's UK small-business division.",

She will also be reviewing its advertising strategy.</p> <p>One of Haste's first announcements <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/14/wonga-appoints-chairman-andy-haste\" title=\"\">on taking up the reins in July</a> was that the controversial grandparent puppets used in the company's TV adverts would be dropped as part of an attempt to clean up Wonga's act.</p> <p>Founded in 2006, Wonga has long come under fire for its sky-high rates \u2013 it offers short-term loans at an annualised interest rate of 5,853%. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/15/fca-imposes-cap-on-payday-loans\" title=\"\">The Church of England has condemned the company as \"morally wrong\"</a> and pledged to compete the industry out of existence by boosting credit unions, while politicians such as Labour's Stella Creasy have labelled its activities \"legal loan sharking\".</p> <p>But the company suffered its biggest blow in June when the Financial Conduct Authority found it <a href=\"http://www.fca.org.uk/news/wonga-redress-unfair-debt-collection-practices\" title=\"\">guilty of unfair and misleading debt-collection practices</a>, including sending letters to struggling borrowers in the names of made-up law firms \"Barker &amp; Lowe\" and \"Chainey, D'Amato &amp; Shannon\". Wonga was ordered to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/25/wonga-compensation-bill-unfair-misleading-practices\" title=\"\">pay compensation of more than \u00a32.6m </a>to about 45,000 customers.</p> <p>A few days before the FCA announcement, it emerged that one of Wonga's founders, Errol Damelin, had quit as a director of the company, seven months after stepping down as chief executive. Weeks earlier, Niall Wass, who replaced Damelin as chief executive last November, announced he was quitting.</p> <p>Kneafsey, who will start her job as managing director of Wonga's UK consumer loans business later this year, indicated the scale of the challenge ahead, saying: \"It is clear the business needs to evolve significantly to become an accepted part of the financial services landscape.\"</p> <p>She added: \"I am pleased to be joining Wonga at such a pivotal time for its UK business. There is undoubtedly a genuine demand for short-term credit.\"</p> <p>Haste said Kneafsey had \"a proven record in putting businesses on the right track\" and would be instrumental in \"returning Wonga to its original vision \u2013 providing short-term loans to the right customers in a responsible and transparent way\".</p> <p>Kneafsey's very first job was as a cashier in an amusement arcade \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.postonline.co.uk/post/column/2144788/penny-speed-meets-tara-kneafsey-sme-director-rsa-uk\" title=\"\">in a 2012 interview</a> she claimed she \"became a bit too good at gambling on the poker machines\" \u2013 and she studied physics to master's level. She started her career as a management consultant before joining RSA in 2006, and most recently led the insurer's UK small-business division.</p>",

The Swedish company announced sales for the 12 months to the end of August rose 3.6% on last year, boosting revenues to \u20ac29bn (\u00a323.2bn). Getting lost in Ikea's maze-like stores or experiencing the frustrations of assembling a flat-pack chest of drawers are fast becoming global experiences as the company now has 315 stores in 27 countries. It is planning its first outlets in South Korea and India. China, home to eight of Ikea's 10 largest stores, has become the company's fastest-growing market, as the mass migration into cities helps create a middle class with money to spend. Ikea said its business had also performed well in North America, where the economic climate had improved. In Europe, which accounts for almost 70% of Ikea's turnover, sales also improved, although the company said \"the challenging situation may not be over\", with eurozone economic growth flat and deflationary pressures looming. \"We continue to see positive signs in consumer spending and it's a great joy to report growth in almost all our markets, not least in the challenging markets in southern Europe,\" said Ikea's chief executive, Peter Agnefj\u00e4ll. Ikea also faces economic slowdown in Russia, which has become one of its key developing markets, accounting for 7% of turnover. Consumer spending has slowed sharply amid rising international tension. Ikea said online shopping and store visits were up, with more information available in its annual report early next year. \"Looking ahead, I see great opportunities for continued growth,\" said Agnefj\u00e4ll.",

Sales at 1,650 Costa stores rose by 7.3% this summer on last year, flattered by a weaker performance in July 2013 when hot weather discouraged people from heading into coffee shops. Costa has since opened more than 100 new stores, as it closes in on a target of 2,200 UK stores and \u00a32bn global sales by 2018. The chain is also booming in China, where it has 350 stores in more than 30 cities, making it Costa's biggest market outside the UK. Total sales in Asia, where the chain also has stores in India and Thailand, grew by 20.8%. Whitbread was also boosted by a strong performance at Premier Inn, with sales up 9.3% on last year, which the company attributed to the improving economy and events such as the Farnborough air show and the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. The hotel chain is expanding rapidly, with plans to open up 4,500 rooms and five hotel restaurants this year. The group said it had acquired three sites in London (Clapham, Sutton and Westminster). It is also launching new city centre hotels, with cheaper, smaller rooms in desirable locations. The first \"hub by Premier Inn\" will open in London's West End later this year, with more to follow in the capital as well as Edinburgh. Whitbread, which also owns the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurant chains, recorded a rise in like-for-like restaurant sales of 3.1%. The FTSE 100 company has become a star performer on the index, with its share price rising by 1.2% to \u00a344.50 on market opening.
