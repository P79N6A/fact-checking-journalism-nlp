Whatever the choices, the new budget must ensure intelligent and efficient investment of European taxpayers' money, while not missing the clear priorities for stimulating growth and competitiveness which will determine our future. We still have time to put things on the right track. To be clear, I am not arguing for a budget increase; and certainly not at a time when most countries in Europe are having to cut back their public spending significantly. The task at hand is much more to do with reprioritising the allocation of scarce budgets, to focus funding on the real growth industries and future technologies rather than on \"legacy\" sectors of the economy. Most people would agree that our approach to investing in innovation today will dictate our industrial and technological capabilities tomorrow, and the jobs and growth that come with them. That's why I support the recent open letter to the European Commission signed by 44 Nobel laureates, 6 Fields medallists and more than 130,000 European citizens highlighting the risks of cutting investment in innovation under the new budget.

If that sounds dramatic, remember that R&amp;T investment in the 1970's and 1980's is still filtering through in aerospace and defence technology that we depend on today, and in aircraft that will still be cutting emissions, noise and congestion as we approach the end of the century.

At worst, it will leave us trailing permanently behind the growing number of nations focused on such opportunities, turning the current economic crisis into rampant industrial decline and leaving us exposed to unnecessary security risks. The budget decision is, therefore, a straight choice between the rise and fall of Europe. Placing Horizon 2020 firmly at the centre of Europe's seven-year budget would send a very clear message to taxpayers, to industry, to investors, to partners and to competition that we are back in the game, and that we are not content to sit still and watch our innovation and industrial capacity head east. This isn't just a chance to address Europe's budget. It's an opportunity to define how we can work together more effectively, to provide a substantial platform for future growth and to determine where we see ourselves in a new world order, where the currency in which we trade will be innovation, and where this commitment to innovation secures the next generation's future.",

      "bodyText": "If the image of bankers has hit a new low during the recession, the reputation of their wives has not been far behind. From articles about how ruthlessly ambitious wives of Lehman bankers competed in team-building hikes despite injured legs, to suspicions they care more about an opulent lifestyle than the morality of their partner's dealings, the stereotypes have not been kind. But the wife of the new governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, may turn this cliche on its head. Diana Fox Carney has the traditional background one would expect, with news reports gushing about the keen hockey player being a \"classic English rose\", whose sister, Lady Rotherwick, is married to a shipping heir. But her career and politics expose a more radical edge. With a string of impressive degrees, Fox Carney is a development economist who in her spare time fights rampant consumerism and happily declares: \"Having more stuff does not make us happy.\" The wives of central bankers are conventionally expected to be solid and predictable. Mervyn King's interior-designer wife Barbara, whom he married in a small ceremony in 2007, for instance, is seldom seen. Philipp Hilderbrand's wife's forays into the headlines ended his career when she bought half-a-million US dollars three weeks before the central bank intervened to cap the Swiss franc. Yet Fox Carney is keen to get her opinions heard, contributing to newspapers and online politics sites \u2013 and some of her views have a distinctly leftwing slant. In a recent piece on inequality, the mother of four wrote warmly about the Occupy movement \u2013 which channelled public anger against the bankers. And despite her husband being set to earn \u00a3624,000 from his new role, she blames the \"visibility and excess\" of those in the \"top 0.1%\" for increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. She even goes on to enthuse about The Spirit Level, a book that suggests economic growth is less important than equality of income, declaring: \"The politics of division are coming home to roost.\" Then there is her environmental campaigning. As well as being vice-president of research in a \"progressive\" thinktank in Canada, Fox Carney also runs an eco-products review site. Alongside discussions of what she will buy her four daughters for Christmas (referring to them as the \"young Foxes\") she is scathing about our consumerist culture. She writes that she has \"seen, firsthand, the devastation that our willful refusal to change our consumerist habits is wreaking on marginal communities\". The author of The Spirit Level, Richard Wilkinson, says of Fox Carney: \"It's important to have that progressive thinking we are beginning to get among a few people in places where they are likely to influence the multinationals and the financial sector, the main bastions of the rise in income inequality.\" Yet not everyone is so sure. Canadian business magazine Macleans said the idea that Fox Carney was \"some sort of tree-hugging leftist radical\" was \"bizarre\". And while it's true that being lectured on inequality by someone so wealthy might seem odd, it's good to know someone close to the Bank of England has more than money on their mind.",

    "webTitle": "Why finding new uses for old drugs is a growing business", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was probably a bad day at the lab when scientists at the US drug group Pfizer's now defunct Sandwich research centre realised an angina treatment they were developing \u2013 a compound called sildenafil \u2013 simply didn't work. It might have been the end of the road for compound UK-92,480 but the drug did have an interesting side-effect: three days after swallowing the pill the male volunteers testing the medicine got a prolonged erection. The treatment was refined and the time delay reduced. It was branded as Viagra and has become a blockbuster, prescribed for erectile dysfunction. As Ian Osterloh, who led its development, recounts: \"None of us at Pfizer thought much of the side-effect at the time. I remember thinking that even if it did work, who would want to take a drug on a Wednesday to get an erection on a Saturday?\" But today the little blue pill is prescribed to millions of men all over the world and made Pfizer nearly $2bn in sales last year. It isn't the only drug originally tested for one purpose that has become a treatment for another. Rogaine, also by Pfizer, was originally developed to treat high blood pressure but is now a successful treatment for hair loss. Finding new uses for old drugs is a growth business as big pharma struggles to come up with new blockbuster drugs. Traditionally pharmaceutical companies test hundreds of thousands of compounds for so-called \"target binding\" in the hunt for new blockbusters. It takes 10-15 years to find a medicine that works and is safe, at a typical cost of $1.3bn. Recycling old compounds for new uses is far cheaper \u2013 and faster. The idea \u2013 known in the drugs' business as repositioning or repurposing \u2013 was first floated in the early 1990s but has gained momentum as the pipeline of potential blockbusters has dried up. Next week scientists and pharmaceutical professionals will descend on Washington for the World Drug Repositioning Congress. A number of university-based spin-outs and small biotech companies have been set up to find new uses for old drugs that were shelved because they didn't work. They take advantage of the declining cost of screening, with some compound libraries \u2013 such as the Johns Hopkins library, which includes 3,500 drugs \u2013 available for screening at a small charge. \"There will be no more blockbusters and it's a massive worry for the industry,\" says Dr Farid Khan, a former GlaxoSmithKline executive who is about to launch PharmaKure, a spin-out from the University of Manchester. \"Existing drugs have been shown to be safe in patients, so if these drugs could be found to work for other diseases, then this would drastically reduce drug development costs and risks. Of 30,000 drugs in the world, 25,000 are ex-patent \u2013 it's a free-for-all.\" He thinks he may have stumbled across a potential preventative drug for Alzheimer's. PK-048 was first developed in the 1980s for Parkinson's by Abbott Laboratories and had never been tested for the most common form of senile dementia, which affects more than 15 million people worldwide. Trials with chimpanzees suggested it can be taken orally, is non-toxic and crosses the blood-brain barrier in primates, which is vital for an Alzheimer's drug. Khan and his business partner Andrew Doig, a professor at Manchester University and an expert on Alzheimer's, have tested the drug and found it blocks the toxic effects of beta-amyloid plaques before they kill brain cells, which is thought to be the cause of the debilitating disease. The four Alzheimer's drugs on the market alleviate symptoms but offer no cure. Numerous medicines are being developed, for example by AstraZeneca in partnership with Axerion, but there have been failures in recent clinical trials,such as Eli Lilly's experimental drug. Khan and Doig believe it is possible their drug could act as a prophylactic medicine for patients diagnosed early and those who are at high risk of getting Alzheimer's. Khan is hopeful he can raise \u00a31m to fund trials of the drug in mice and humans, with US venture capitalists having shown interest, but he is also looking for a partnership with a big pharmaceutical company in the long run. Dr Aris Persidis, president and co-founder of the US drug repositioning firm Biovista, points out that between 2007 and 2009, 30% of all newly marketed medicines were either existing drugs or new formulations of old drugs. \"Typically, repositioning is done by accident, or in a limited way,\" he wrote in an article on drug repositioning last year. \"New technologies however enable the systematic evaluation of any drug or mechanism of action against any disease.\" Biovista is in the process of filing for novel use patents for 12 drugs with potential in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, depression and sleep disorders. Clive Morris, head of the new opportunities division at AstraZeneca, says medicines that have already been in clinical trials can skip the early phase of drug development and go straight into phase two (mid-stage) trials, which can save three to five years. AstraZeneca is now testing a failed diabetes and obesity drug for use as a glaucoma treatment. The big drug makers are also offering compounds to other researchers. Last month, AstraZeneca made 22 failed medicines available to academics through a partnership with the Medical Research Council and it also struck a \u00a3180m partnership with its bigger rival GlaxoSmithKline in May to boost the faltering development of new antibiotics, dubbed NewDrugs4BadBugs.

It was branded as Viagra and has become a blockbuster, prescribed for erectile dysfunction.</p> <p>As Ian Osterloh, who led its development, recounts: \"None of us at Pfizer thought much of the side-effect at the time. I remember thinking that even if it did work, who would want to take a drug on a Wednesday to get an erection on a Saturday?\"</p> <p>But today the little blue pill is prescribed to millions of men all over the world and made Pfizer nearly $2bn in sales last year.</p> <p>It isn't the only drug originally tested for one purpose that has become a treatment for another. Rogaine, also by Pfizer, was originally developed to treat high blood pressure but is now a successful treatment for hair loss.</p> <p>Finding new uses for old drugs is a growth business as big pharma struggles to come up with new blockbuster drugs. Traditionally pharmaceutical companies test hundreds of thousands of compounds for so-called \"target binding\" in the hunt for new blockbusters. It takes 10-15 years to find a medicine that works and is safe, at a typical cost of $1.3bn.</p> <p>Recycling old compounds for new uses is far cheaper \u2013 and faster. The idea \u2013 known in the drugs' business as repositioning or repurposing \u2013 was first floated in the early 1990s but has gained momentum as the pipeline of potential blockbusters has dried up. Next week scientists and pharmaceutical professionals will descend on Washington for the World Drug Repositioning Congress.</p> <p>A number of university-based spin-outs and small biotech companies have been set up to find new uses for old drugs that were shelved because they didn't work. They take advantage of the declining cost of screening, with some compound libraries \u2013 such as the Johns Hopkins library, which includes 3,500 drugs \u2013 available for screening at a small charge.</p> <p>\"There will be no more blockbusters and it's a massive worry for the industry,\" says Dr Farid Khan, a former GlaxoSmithKline executive who is about to launch PharmaKure, a spin-out from the University of Manchester.</p> <p>\"Existing drugs have been shown to be safe in patients, so if these drugs could be found to work for other diseases, then this would drastically reduce drug development costs and risks. Of 30,000 drugs in the world, 25,000 are ex-patent \u2013 it's a free-for-all.\"</p> <p>He thinks he may have stumbled across a potential preventative drug for Alzheimer's. PK-048 was first developed in the 1980s for Parkinson's by Abbott Laboratories and had never been tested for the most common form of senile dementia, which affects more than 15 million people worldwide. Trials with chimpanzees suggested it can be taken orally, is non-toxic and crosses the blood-brain barrier in primates, which is vital for an Alzheimer's drug.</p> <p>Khan and his business partner Andrew Doig, a professor at Manchester University and an expert on Alzheimer's, have tested the drug and found it blocks the toxic effects of beta-amyloid plaques before they kill brain cells, which is thought to be the cause of the debilitating disease. The four Alzheimer's drugs on the market alleviate symptoms but offer no cure.

Chemring's shares climbed 8.2p to 238.2p and Andrew Gollan at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Chemring's trading update provides a degree of clarity and comfort (on revenue and net debt) after what has been a very difficult year.

      "bodyText": "BAE Systems, whose planned merger with Airbus maker EADS failed to get off the ground, is now a prime target for bid speculation. The latest talk was that US group Lockheed Martin could be interested in the UK defence group, and that was enough to push its shares 7.7p higher to 319.7p, although they came off their best levels. Still with defence Chemring, which received a bid proposal from private equity group Carlyle and also issued a couple of profit warnings, was back in favour after an update which showed trading had not got any worse. The Carlyle move came to nothing, although dealers were still hoping for further private equity interest in the business. The company said its 2012 performance had been extremely disappointing but would be in line with the recent warning. New chief executive Mark Papworth will present his thoughts on the company's future in January at its full year results. Chemring's shares climbed 8.2p to 238.2p and Andrew Gollan at Investec said: Chemring's trading update provides a degree of clarity and comfort (on revenue and net debt) after what has been a very difficult year. A combination of more challenging market conditions and a poor operational performance across a number of businesses has led to a material decline in earnings. Looking forward, end markets are unlikely to offer relief, but we believe our forecasts have been reset conservatively and upside exists from improving operational delivery. We resume coverage with a new price target of 280p. Overall, banks were among the leading risers, as markets gave a cautiously positive reaction to the late night agreement on Greece's aid package, with the FTSE 100 closing 12.99 points higher at 5799.71. Downgrades from the OECD did not help the general mood. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 10p to 295.1p, also benefiting after an upgrade from UBS. It raised its rating from neutral to buy in the wake of Monday's announcement of the new Bank of England governor.

It said it was on track to meet full year earnings, and it has also said it was minded to accept changes to its operating licence, although it wants further clarity from regulator Ofwat. Capita climbed 23p to 751p after the outsourcing group was named as preferred bidder for an educational services contract in Staffordshire, a 20 year joint venture which marks its biggest ever deal. But the company is expected to lose out on its Criminal Records Bureau contract to Tata Consulting, with an announcement expected as soon as Wednesday.

This is positive for Greece and for other eurozone sovereigns. The deal could help put Greece's sovereign debt on a sustainable footing, although key questions remain to be answered, and implementation risk is high.</p> <p><strong>We would not treat a debt buy-back as a credit event provided it was wholly voluntary and had no adverse implications for non-participants.</strong></p> <p>Questions remain on how the bank recapitalisation will be implemented and whether the capital injection will be sufficient to ensure the banks' long-term viability. For example, a sovereign debt buy-back could result in further losses for Greek banks, while further asset quality deterioration, and the Bank of Greece's 10% core capital ratio requirement by end-June 2013 will also increase the banks' capital needs.</p> <p>So implementation risk, which has been a problem with all the Greek programmes to date, will remain high. It is unclear whether the new agreement can boost Greek consumer and investor confidence sufficiently to stop the economic contraction (by end-2012 Fitch estimates that the economy will have contracted by 20% in real terms since 2007).</p> <p><strong>These risks are reflected in our 'CCC' rating on Greece, which denotes substantial credit risk.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-27T17:11:29.394Z\">at 5.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50b4f25a95cb3640bc6e47f3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-27T17:03:22.409Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">French jobless total hits higher for 14 years</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some bad figures from France: jobless figures jumped to their highest level in 14 years in October.</p> <p>The number of registered jobseekers rose by 45,000 to 3.103m.

IHS Global Insight economist Diego Iscaro asks if it will solve the country's problems and comes up with a short answer: no.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given Greece's huge debt burden, lower interest rates and extended maturities will not make significant inroads towards assuring the long-term sustainability of Greece's debt. Even if Greece manages to post the very large primary \u2013 ie excluding interest payments \u2013 fiscal surpluses envisaged by the troika, public debt will still be above 120% of GDP by 2020. Indeed, the targets included in the programme are very ambitious, particularly taking into account Greece's track record, and implementation risks remain huge.</p> <p>Yesterday's deal does not change that fact. Reaching the desired target will also need significant debt relief coming from the proposed debt buyback. Historical precedents show that buybacks are normally an inefficient and costly way to reduce debt. The risk is that the announcement of buybacks normally triggers a sharp increase in bond prices, reducing its effectiveness.</p> <p>To confirm this fear, the yield on long term Greek bonds \u2013 which are inversely correlated to prices \u2013 fell sharply at the start of trading today (27 November). The statement released by the Eurogroup stipulated that the prices on the exchange should not be higher than those at the close of last week, but this put a question mark on whether bondholder participation will be large enough at those prices.</p> <p>In the past, we have said that a long lasting solution to Greece's problem is likely to involve significant debt relief. Yesterday's deal did not deliver on that front but, in our view, it did not close the door completely. Indeed, the revised debt targets, and particularly the sharp fall expected in debt levels between 2020 and 2022 (from 124% of GDP to \"significantly below\" 110% of GDP), suggest that a compromise might have been reached between the Eurogroup and the IMF where the latter agrees to the Eurozone's strategy of \"buying more time\" in return for a more permanent solution in the future (ie, after the German federal elections to be held in September/October 2013).</p> <p>This could prove to be significant, although \"buying more time\" can also be risky given that the Greek economic and political situation is expected to continue to deteriorate over the coming quarters.</p> </blockquote>  <p>And the late night deal has not stopped the protests in Greece. Municipal workers have gathered outside the public sector reform ministry, angry at government plans to place 2,000 civil servants on notice ahead of reassignment or potential dismissal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-771d4248-b5b7-410d-a45f-deee566eddee\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/27/1354030177102/4ec7ae87-dba2-45a0-a82f-e1ee2835dd38-460.jpeg\" alt=\"\u00a0Photograph: Aristidis Vafeiadakis/ZUMA Press/Corbis\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">&nbsp;Photograph: Aristidis Vafeiadakis/ZUMA Press/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-33571281-37ec-4315-8d93-dd48440a9d5d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/27/1354030447834/cf5a6b65-3538-42e5-978f-091562c44389-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Photograph:  Aristidis Vafeiadakis/ZUMA Press/Corbis\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph:  Aristidis Vafeiadakis/ZUMA Press/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-27T15:37:58.541Z\">at 3.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50b4d88cb579b99501eaa983\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-27T15:13:16.880Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Positive US confidence and manufacturing data</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More US data - consumer confidence was at a four-and-a-half-year high in November, amid increased optimism about the economy.</p> <p>The conference board index rose to 73.7 from 73.1 the month before, its highest since February 2008.</p> <p>There were also some positive manufacturing and service figures from the Richmond Federal Reserve.</p> <p>Still not enough to keep the Dow Jones Industrial Average in positive territory however - it is now down 13 points or so.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-27T15:18:03.714Z\">at 3.18pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50b4cf1f95cb3640bc6e47d3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-27T14:33:03.556Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens lower on fiscal cliff worries</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Away from the immediate eurozone crisis, investors are concerned about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/07/us-fiscal-cliff-q-and-a?INTCMP=SRCH\">US fiscal cliff</a> - the forthcoming tax rises and spending cuts.

Greece looks to have the finance to keep it solvent until 2014. It will stay in the euro, at least for now. The Germans can say that they have not given an inch. Investors, relieved that the uncertainty is over, will probably push the single currency higher on the foreign exchanges.</p> <p>But Greece\u2019s economic agony will go on. The financial package is enough for the government to pay its bills but not enough to end the recession and start reducing unemployment from 25%. As growth falters, the debt position will not improve as quickly as Greece\u2019s eurozone partners anticipate. And there will be more burning of the midnight oil in Brussels.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Kit Juckes of <em>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</em></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>World record can-kicking attempt successfully achieved...</p> <p>The key issue for Greece, as for the rest of the eurozone, is the lack of growth. Trapped in an austerity trap, governments tighten their belts and watch budget outcomes miss their targets. Today's optimistic mood will in due course be reversed unless someone comes along with a magic growth potion.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There remains the potential for this deal to fall apart in the medium term as there are a lot of moving parts and it is a long way away from the permanent fix that the IMF had been insisting upon. Instead it is just one more big kick of the can down the road....</p> <p>The idea is that rather than Greece reducing its debt/GDP to 120% by 2020 they will now reduce it to 124% by that date. So one arbitrary figure has been replaced by another. After all one man\u2019s figure for debt sustainability is another man\u2019s figure for insolvency.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DrGerardLyons/status/273347178586599424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Greek PM says \"A new day begins tomorrow for all Greeks\".

<div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning, and welcome to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/series/eurozone-crisis-live\">our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis</a>.</p> <p><strong>Thee big news this morning is that yesterday's Eurogroup meeting finally agreed a deal over Greece's bailout programme that will, at last, unlock the country's long-awaited aid payments.</strong></p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/26/eurozone-crisis-greece-aid-eurogroup-meeting#block-50b3ef7d95cb3640bc6e4776\">we blogged overnight</a>, the deal will see Greece's debt cut by \u20ac40bn, dropping to 124% of GDP by 2020 \u2013 a slightly less taxing target than before.</p> <p>The country's international lenders also promised to take further measures to bring Greece's debts \"significantly below 110%\" in 2022 \u2013 which looks like the first signal that some form of debt writeoff is being considered.</p> <p>Lenders have agreed three steps to help Greece:</p> <p><strong>1) Cutting the interest rate on official loans, extend their maturity by 15 years to 30 years, and granting Athens a 10-year interest repayment deferral.</strong></p> <p><strong>2) To return \u20ac11bn of profits accrued through the European Central Bank's purchase of distressed Greek government bonds</strong></p> <p><strong>3) To conduct a debt-buyback scheme.</strong></p> <p>Greece will receive its aid tranche in stages, starting with \u20ac34.2bn next month. Much of the money will be used to recapitalise its banks.</p> <p>That means the chatter about Athens running out of money should finally dampen down. However, this deal is only \"tentative\" - the IMF won't hand over its share of the money until the debt buyback has been conducted.</p> <p>And national parliaments must also be consulted.</p> <p>The deal only came after another lengthy negotiations session in Brussels, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/27/eu-imf-greek-debt\">as our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, writes</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After almost 12 hours of talks for the third time in a fortnight between eurozone finance ministers, leaders of the IMF, the European central bank and the European commission struggled to reach a consensus, suggesting a lack of confidence that the effort to resurrect the Greek economy will bear fruit or that three years of European bailout policy was working.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/27/eu-imf-greek-debt\">Ian's full story on the deal is here</a>: </strong></p> <p><strong>I'll be covering all the details and reaction to the deal through the day, along with other developments in the world economy.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-27T09:50:04.641Z\">at 9.50am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of Spain has approved the restructuring plans of four nationalised banks, according to the FROB rescue fund. The fund expects the European Commission to give its go-ahead for the proposals on Wednesday, Reuters is reporting. The funds from Europe should then be received in the first half of December. Meanwhile German chancellor Angela Merkel is urging her party to pass the Greek measures but it is still unclear whether the country's parliament will vote on Thursday or Friday, or indeed whether there will be a delay. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back tomorrow for the latest developments. Here's our correspondent Helena Smith on Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras's address to the nation: Samaras has just given a rousing address to the nation praising today's agreement and describing it as a springboard for \"the rebirth of our country.\" Samaras, who is hoping the landnmark deal will help boost his fragile coalition, used the ten-minute address to promise Greeks that there would be no more austerity in the form of tax increases, pension and wage cuts once it had brought \"tortuous debt problem\" under control. \"A very dark period for Greece has ended,\" he said before launching into a point-by-point breakdown of the accord reached in Brussels by the EU and IMF early this morning. Ratings agency Fitch has said the Greek deal is positive although some key questions remain: The announcement of an agreement aimed at securing Greek debt sustainability and allowing the next disbursement of financial aid eases the immediate threat of a Greek sovereign default or eurozone exit. This is positive for Greece and for other eurozone sovereigns. The deal could help put Greece's sovereign debt on a sustainable footing, although key questions remain to be answered, and implementation risk is high. We would not treat a debt buy-back as a credit event provided it was wholly voluntary and had no adverse implications for non-participants. Questions remain on how the bank recapitalisation will be implemented and whether the capital injection will be sufficient to ensure the banks' long-term viability. For example, a sovereign debt buy-back could result in further losses for Greek banks, while further asset quality deterioration, and the Bank of Greece's 10% core capital ratio requirement by end-June 2013 will also increase the banks' capital needs. So implementation risk, which has been a problem with all the Greek programmes to date, will remain high. It is unclear whether the new agreement can boost Greek consumer and investor confidence sufficiently to stop the economic contraction (by end-2012 Fitch estimates that the economy will have contracted by 20% in real terms since 2007). These risks are reflected in our 'CCC' rating on Greece, which denotes substantial credit risk. Here's some bad figures from France: jobless figures jumped to their highest level in 14 years in October. The number of registered jobseekers rose by 45,000 to 3.103m. Unemployment has now risen for 18 months on the trot. According to Reuters, labour minister Michel Sapin said: This run of negative figures on employment only increases our determination to do something to reverse the trend between now and the end of next year. Athens journalist Efthimia Efthimiou is tweeting comments from Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras following last night's debt deal. European markets have closed, and it's a mixed performance despite the Greek debt deal overnight: \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 12.99 points higher at 57799.71, up 0.22% \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.55% \u2022 France's Cac has dipped 0.08% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is down 0.26% \u2022 Spain's Ibex has lost 0.14% \u2022 Athens has edged up 0.29% but the Greek banking sector is off 9.8% In the US, a spate of reasonable economic data has been offset by continuing concerns about the fiscal cliff and budget talks to resolve the problem. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 0.11%. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: Today's gains in equity markets on the back of last night's so-called Greek deal have been tempered by uncertainty about how the buyback will be financed and questions surrounding the numbers with respect to debt sustainability. Another factor that hasn't helped is the fact that the OECD downgraded its growth projections for 31 of its 34 members refocusing market attention back on the small matter of the toxic effect the European crisis continues to have on global growth prospects, and particularly growth prospects in the euro area. The reality is this agreement has more to do with the politics of German Chancellor Angela Merkel getting re-elected next year, rather than helping the Greek economy back on to its feet, and as such the perception remains that this deal is merely delaying the inevitable once again. EU officials continue to rule out any talk of debt restructuring, despite it being plain to everyone that it remains the only way forward. There was some ambiguity about looking at further measures if and when Greece returned to a surplus position, but the idea was left hanging. The Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, will apparently give a television address on the late-night debt deal later - in about half an hour, in fact. Following Fitch's recent downgrade of Cyprus and - subsequently - the country's banks, the ratings agency has now cut Bank of Cyprus and Cyprus Popular Bank's covered bonds. The country is said to be close to a bailout, the fourth eurozone member after Greece, Ireland and Portugal. More comment on last night's Greek deal. IHS Global Insight economist Diego Iscaro asks if it will solve the country's problems and comes up with a short answer: no. Given Greece's huge debt burden, lower interest rates and extended maturities will not make significant inroads towards assuring the long-term sustainability of Greece's debt. Even if Greece manages to post the very large primary \u2013 ie excluding interest payments \u2013 fiscal surpluses envisaged by the troika, public debt will still be above 120% of GDP by 2020. Indeed, the targets included in the programme are very ambitious, particularly taking into account Greece's track record, and implementation risks remain huge. Yesterday's deal does not change that fact. Reaching the desired target will also need significant debt relief coming from the proposed debt buyback. Historical precedents show that buybacks are normally an inefficient and costly way to reduce debt. The risk is that the announcement of buybacks normally triggers a sharp increase in bond prices, reducing its effectiveness. To confirm this fear, the yield on long term Greek bonds \u2013 which are inversely correlated to prices \u2013 fell sharply at the start of trading today (27 November). The statement released by the Eurogroup stipulated that the prices on the exchange should not be higher than those at the close of last week, but this put a question mark on whether bondholder participation will be large enough at those prices. In the past, we have said that a long lasting solution to Greece's problem is likely to involve significant debt relief. Yesterday's deal did not deliver on that front but, in our view, it did not close the door completely. Indeed, the revised debt targets, and particularly the sharp fall expected in debt levels between 2020 and 2022 (from 124% of GDP to \"significantly below\" 110% of GDP), suggest that a compromise might have been reached between the Eurogroup and the IMF where the latter agrees to the Eurozone's strategy of \"buying more time\" in return for a more permanent solution in the future (ie, after the German federal elections to be held in September/October 2013). This could prove to be significant, although \"buying more time\" can also be risky given that the Greek economic and political situation is expected to continue to deteriorate over the coming quarters. And the late night deal has not stopped the protests in Greece. Municipal workers have gathered outside the public sector reform ministry, angry at government plans to place 2,000 civil servants on notice ahead of reassignment or potential dismissal. More US data - consumer confidence was at a four-and-a-half-year high in November, amid increased optimism about the economy. The conference board index rose to 73.7 from 73.1 the month before, its highest since February 2008. There were also some positive manufacturing and service figures from the Richmond Federal Reserve. Still not enough to keep the Dow Jones Industrial Average in positive territory however - it is now down 13 points or so. Away from the immediate eurozone crisis, investors are concerned about the US fiscal cliff - the forthcoming tax rises and spending cuts. Democrats and Republicans are negotiating to find a solution to the budget problem, so any US data at the moment is being scoured for signs of how the world's biggest economy is performing. Orders for capital goods, excluding aircraft, rebounded 1.7% last month, after a 0.4% fall the previous month, suggesting businesses are more optimistic about their spending plans. But actual shipments fell for the fourth straight month, which analysts put down to worries about the fiscal cliff. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: All in all, today's report is mixed, a sign that factory activity remains subdued and no sharp acceleration is expected any time soon, as well flagged by recent business confidence indicators. Elsewhere there were positive signs from the housing market. The S&amp;P/Shiller index rose 0.4% in September, with house prices showing a 3% year-on-year increase. But the uncertainty over the budget talks has pushed Wall Street lower in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 30 points. Dublin will deliver its own austerity budget next week, and reports today suggest that the Irish government giveth and the Irish government taketh away. Henry McDonald has the story: Reports suggest next week's fifth austerity, cost-cutting budget will include reviewing dole payments to the jobless if they remain claiming social welfare after nine months. Nearly 15% of the Irish workforce is currently unemployed. However, the Fine Gael-Labour coalition also announced today that it is committed to one of the biggest capital projects in Dublin - the linking up of the two LUAS tram lines that run on both the north and south sides of the river Liffey. Ireland's transport minister, Leo Varadkar, confirmed today the cabinet had voted to pledge \u20ac370m to the project, which is likely to generate 800 construction jobs with a further 60 permanent posts to run the link-up line. \"The two Luas lines should have been joined up years ago. It's a privilege for me as minister for transport to be able to finish the job\", the minister said. Meanwhile another casualty of the ongoing economic crisis in Ireland has been the seasonal letter from Irish children to the Santa Claus residence at the North Pole. An Post - Ireland's version of the Royal Mail - has issued an appeal to parents and guardians to put a 55 cent stamp on their kids' Santa letters this year. Henry continues: The postal service has said that while they normally take bags of post \"to the North Pole\" [honest, kids - Ed.] for free, the continuing recession is effecting everyone equally. An Post has also pointed out they are competing with other online Santa services that all charge for delivery to Father Christmas. If your letter does not have a stamp, An Post says it will still deliver it. Is nothing sacred? On that sombre note, I think I'd better hand over to Nick Fletcher..... Newsflash from Lisbon - the Portuguese parliament has just approved the 2013 budget, despite public protests. The unpopular budget contained \u20ac5.3bn of austerity measures, mainly through higher taxes (including steep rises in income tax). Thousands of people gathered close to the parliament building in Lisbon, to register their opposition to the budget: Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define thinktank isn't impressed by the agreement reached overnight on Greece: Speaking of Germany.... one of Merkel's parliamentary allies, Michael Meister, (a deputy party leader in the Bundestag) has said MPs would have to vote down the Greek deal, if they believe it would lead to a Greek debt writedown in future. Meister said: I do not see a public sector haircut as being part of this deal. If that were the case, then the Bundestag would have to decide...not to approve the next aid tranche. (that's also via Reuters) Meister added that he believes the vote will be carried with a large majority (for the reasons explained in the previous post). But the issue of a Greek haircut won't go away... It looks as if the Greek deal agreed last night will sail through the Bundestag when it is voted on later this week (on Thursday or Friday - reports vary). The opposition SDP party has indicated that it will back the plan, and Angela Merkel should be able to rally most of the coalition behind it too. However there is also political tension in Berlin today, Reuters reports: SPD parliamentary leader Frank-Walter Steinmeier said his party would not do anything \"that could lead to Greece becoming unable to make its payments in the short term or could force it to leave the euro zone\". But he accused German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble of pulling the wool over the eyes of the public, which might accept granting already-agreed aid tranches but would not easily support a second write-down of Greek public debt. \"Mr Sch\u00e4uble brags to his own bloc that a debt haircut has been avoided but I tell you it has just been postponed to after the Bundestag elections,\" he told German TV, adding that euro zone ministers had made \"cryptic hints\" to this effect. Italy continues to avoid the heat from the eurocrisis - this morning it sold two-year bonds at the lowest borrowing costs since October 2010. The auction of \u20ac3.5bn-worth of two-year bonds saw investors pay average yields (or interest rates) of 1.923% \u2013 sharply down from 2.397% last month. The sale shows that bond traders are not, yet, alarmed by the political situation in Italy (with Silvio Berlusconi considering a comeback). Nick Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy pointed out that 12 months ago, Italy's bond market looked \"broken\". Now, though... The fairly modest size of the sale, coupled with the favourable sentiment towards peripheral eurozone paper, ensured that today's auction was pretty much a walk in the park for the Treasury. Although the cover was not particularly impressive, the yield was at pre-crisis levels, auguring well for Thursday's sale of longer-dated debt. The OECD has also suggested that Greece should deviate from its fiscal reform plans if its recession proves even deeper than feared. In an apparent challenge to the country's creditors, the OECD said today: The agreed consolidation measures should be put in place, but if growth proves lower than assumed in the government's fiscal plans, then the automatic stabilisers should be allowed to operate, even if this means missing the set targets. \"Automatic stabilisers\" is the term for allowing welfare spending to rise, and tax receipts to fall, during the low points of the economic cycle. Over in Paris, the OECD has been presenting its latest Economic Outlook - explaining why it has slashed its growth forecasts (see 10.12am). The OECD secretary-general, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, said: The world economy is far from being out of the woods The US \u2018fiscal cliff\u2019, if it materialises, could tip an already weak economy into recession, while failure to solve the euro area crisis could lead to a major financial shock and global downturn. Governments must act decisively, using all the tools at their disposal to turn confidence around and boost growth and jobs, in the United States, in Europe, and elsewhere. The OECD now expects the world economy to grow by just 2.9% this year and 3.4% in 2013, down from previous forecasts of 3.4% and 4.2%. Over to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith says amid all the jubilation triggered by the deal there are already loud voices of discontent in a country that will have to pay a heavy price for the deal. Helena writes: In what will surely go down as a defining point in the euro debt drama, the deal reached in Brussels has been quick to elicit euphoria in Athens. In all three parties backing prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s fragile coalition, there is broad consensus that the agreement has finally hit the mark of effectively dealing not only with Greece\u2019s empty coffers but its perilous mountain of debt. Speaking to the state-run TV channel NET, interior minister Evripides Sylianides described the deal as \u201cguaranteeing Greece\u2019s place not only in the euro but in \u201dthe hard core of Europe\"\u201d The minister, a senior cadre in Samaras\u2019s centre-right New Democracy party, added: \u201cWe got the installment [of aid], we got the [two-year] extension [to achieve fiscal targets], we got the maximum that we could have won.\" But despite the sense of hard-won triumphalism for a government that has been in power for barely five months, ambivalence also reigns supreme \u2013 and not just within the ranks of the main opposition party, Syriza, whose leader, Alexis Tsipras, has just slammed the agreement saying: It does not include a viable plan for Greece and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not a deal. A real solution will only happen when there is big political change. Syriza MP Dimitris Papadoumilis had earlier described the agreement as a \u201cBand-aid\". \u201cIt will barely last two months,\u201d he said. Economics professors and analysts are also questioning the efficacy of a rescue that, once again, precludes growth and development in a country that must endure yet more recession as the result of internationally mandated austerity measures, the price of the aid. \u201cGrowth cannot be sustained through recession and a program that has constantly been off target,\u201d said the analyst Stavros Lygeros. \u201cThe [package] is undoubtedly good but I\u2019m afraid it is far from being enough.\u201d Reducing the country\u2019s debt-GDP ratio to 124% by 2020 would not be enough either. \u201cWe all know that to be viable a debt load should not be more than 90% of GDP,\u201d Athens University economics professor George Pagoulatos told NET TV as news of the breakthrough came through. MPs on the Treasury committee are giving Sir Mervyn King and other senior policymakers a tough time over allegations that there is an \"intimidatory culture\" at the bank. That follows a report this month which attacked the \"autocratic management\" at the Bank. King dismissed the criticism, though, telling MPs that junior bank staff never held back from giving him this views: I've never seen them remotely shy about saying: 'Hang on, what about this'? This is an organisation that has always encouraged debate. Paul Fisher said that the Bank should consider why some junior staff have the \"perception\" that they can't make unpalatable proposals to senior staff (the very people who were too slow to realise how weak the global economy was.) Economics journalists watching the session aren't impressed: You can watch the whole session here (either live, or from the start). Over in Parliament, Sir Mervyn King has just endorsed (again) the choice of Mark Carney to replace him as Bank of England governor. Appearing before the Treasury Committee (to discuss the latest UK inflation report), King said that any governor would want to hand on the job to \"someone who they know can carry on the good work\" With Mark Carney you have someone with whom the bank is in very good hands... And the United Kington should take pride, not only that we will search the world for the best candidate, but that we have produced a very strong shortlist....a truly outstanding shortlist for the chancellor. King admits, under questioning from Andrew Tyrie, that the Bank had finally realised that the chances of very rapid growth in 2013 and 2014 were not very great. In short, the Bank was too optimistic about the global economy, and too slow to see the truth. As King put it: We should have done it earlier, and we didn't. King added that \"global imbalances' mean weak global growth, and that the Bank is ready to adjust policy 'in either direction' depending on the outlook for inflation The OECD has just released a new forecast on the world economy, sparking a flurry of headlines. Here's what you need to know \u2022 The OECD has warned that the eurozone crisis is a bigger threat than the fiscal cliff \u2022 It also believes that the UK recovery will be slow, but not as slow as it thought earlier this year \u2022 And it warned that Greece's recession will last until 2015 \u2022 It has cut the growth forecasts of 31 countries, warning that 2013 will be much weaker than it previously thought More on that UK GDP data for Q3 2012 released by the Office for National Statistics: \u2022 Industrial output: + 0.9% quarter-on-quarter (highest since Q2 2010) \u2022 Services output: + 1.3% q-q (highest since Q3 2007) \u2022 Construction output: -2.6% q-q And with the topline growth confirmed at +1.0%, the UK's strong bounceback from recession is confirmed. Just in -- revised UK GDP data has confirmed that the British economy expanded by 1.0% in the third quarter of 2012, as initially thought. However, year-on-year GDP change has been nudged down to -0.1%, from unchanged. I mentioned yesterday that angry EU farmers were demonstrating in Brussels yesterday. Well, the eurogroup may have gone \u2013 but the protesters have returned, using tractors to block roads in the centre of the capital. They are protesting about UK milk quotas and prices \u2013 another sign of rising tension in the EU. Here's our first roundup of early reaction to the Greek deal. Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott In the short run, this deal should do the trick. Greece looks to have the finance to keep it solvent until 2014. It will stay in the euro, at least for now. The Germans can say that they have not given an inch. Investors, relieved that the uncertainty is over, will probably push the single currency higher on the foreign exchanges. But Greece\u2019s economic agony will go on. The financial package is enough for the government to pay its bills but not enough to end the recession and start reducing unemployment from 25%. As growth falters, the debt position will not improve as quickly as Greece\u2019s eurozone partners anticipate. And there will be more burning of the midnight oil in Brussels. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale World record can-kicking attempt successfully achieved... The key issue for Greece, as for the rest of the eurozone, is the lack of growth. Trapped in an austerity trap, governments tighten their belts and watch budget outcomes miss their targets. Today's optimistic mood will in due course be reversed unless someone comes along with a magic growth potion. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research There remains the potential for this deal to fall apart in the medium term as there are a lot of moving parts and it is a long way away from the permanent fix that the IMF had been insisting upon. Instead it is just one more big kick of the can down the road.... The idea is that rather than Greece reducing its debt/GDP to 120% by 2020 they will now reduce it to 124% by that date. So one arbitrary figure has been replaced by another. After all one man\u2019s figure for debt sustainability is another man\u2019s figure for insolvency. The murkier part of the deal relates to the plan to buy back billions of euros of Greek debt from investors at a discount to the face value -- thus cutting Greece's total national debt. Rumours of this plan have been circulating for weeks - driving up the value of Greek bonds in the market (and thus diluting the potential benefits). Christine Lagarde was notably reluctant to discuss the plan at the post-midnight press conference - presumably to avoid getting bond traders even more excited. But the bottom line is that there's no guarantee that this debt buyback will be a big success. The FT has a good explanation on this issue: The key to a debt buyback is to purchase outstanding bonds at heavily distressed prices, allowing Greece to retire the debt far more cheaply than if they had to pay the bonds off when they reached maturity. But in a statement, finance ministers said the buyback price for bonds could be no higher than prices at Friday\u2019s market close \u2013 meaning there will be little if any premium offered to private debtholders, raising questions about how many will participate. And if the debt buyback flops, the IMF might not hand over its share of Greece's aid tranche - worth around \u20ac10bn. There's a muted reaction to the Greek deal in the financial markets today. Shares have risen, but the euro has dropped back after hitting a one-month high of $1.301 v the dollar. In early trading... FTSE 100: up 27 points at 5814, +0.5% German DAX: up 51 points at 7343, + 0.7% French CAC: up 28 points at 3529, + 0.8% Spanish IBEX: up 64 points at 7939, +0.8% Italian FTSE MIB: up 95 points at 15615, + 0.6% Traders are aware that the deal isn't the last we'll hear about Greece's bailout, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: It remains to be seen if this particular deal will be any more successful than previous EU deals to help Greece, and the likelihood is that we will probably be back discussing another renegotiation before too long. Greece's prime minister, Antonis Samaras, gave the deal a bleary-eyed welcome earlier this morning. Speaking to reporters outside his official residence at around 3am local time, Samaras said: Everything went well...All Greeks fought together. A new day begins tomorrow for all Greeks. Reuters described Samaras as \"bleary-eyed\" and \"visibly tired\" \u2013 no surprise given the stress of the last few weeks. If you missed last night's press conference (which kicked off around 12.30am GMT as I remember), here's some of the key quotes: Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the eurogroup: This is not about money....This is the promise of a better future for the Greek people and for the euro area as a whole, a break from the era of missed targets and loose implementation towards a new paradigm of steadfast reform momentum, declining debt ratios and a return to growth. Olli Rehn, European commissioner for monetary affairs: This was a test for the eurozone and we simply could not afford to fail. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble: When Greece has achieved, or is about to achieve, a primary surplus and fulfilled all of its conditions, we will, if need be, consider further measures for the reduction of the total debt IMF managing director Christine Lagarde [the deal is] a substantial contribution to the sustainability of Greece's debt. The official statement released by the eurogroup can be downloaded here (pdf). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis. Thee big news this morning is that yesterday's Eurogroup meeting finally agreed a deal over Greece's bailout programme that will, at last, unlock the country's long-awaited aid payments. As we blogged overnight, the deal will see Greece's debt cut by \u20ac40bn, dropping to 124% of GDP by 2020 \u2013 a slightly less taxing target than before. The country's international lenders also promised to take further measures to bring Greece's debts \"significantly below 110%\" in 2022 \u2013 which looks like the first signal that some form of debt writeoff is being considered. Lenders have agreed three steps to help Greece: 1) Cutting the interest rate on official loans, extend their maturity by 15 years to 30 years, and granting Athens a 10-year interest repayment deferral. 2) To return \u20ac11bn of profits accrued through the European Central Bank's purchase of distressed Greek government bonds 3) To conduct a debt-buyback scheme. Greece will receive its aid tranche in stages, starting with \u20ac34.2bn next month. Much of the money will be used to recapitalise its banks. That means the chatter about Athens running out of money should finally dampen down. However, this deal is only \"tentative\" - the IMF won't hand over its share of the money until the debt buyback has been conducted. And national parliaments must also be consulted. The deal only came after another lengthy negotiations session in Brussels, as our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, writes: After almost 12 hours of talks for the third time in a fortnight between eurozone finance ministers, leaders of the IMF, the European central bank and the European commission struggled to reach a consensus, suggesting a lack of confidence that the effort to resurrect the Greek economy will bear fruit or that three years of European bailout policy was working. Ian's full story on the deal is here: I'll be covering all the details and reaction to the deal through the day, along with other developments in the world economy.",

      "bodyText": "Bombardier Aerospace's Belfast operation has received a fillip after a private jet charter firm ordered 142 planes from the company. The deal with VistaJet is worth more than \u00a34.8bn with the Belfast plant making a number of components for the jet range. In a statement on Tuesday, the firmsmanagement in Belfast said the factory plays a leading role in the business jet sector. \"This order \u2013 the largest ever business aircraft sale in Bombardier's history \u2013 will help to sustain jobs and secure our long-term future, in addition to benefiting our local supply chain,\" it said. The planes will play a key part in VistaJet's expansion plans and its push to make business aviation more accessible in \"embryonic\" markets, its chairman, Thomas Flohr, said. The aircraft will serve fast growing regions such as Russia, Kazakhstan, China, the Middle East and Africa, Flohr said, along with the US.

Figures released on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics left the initial growth estimate for the third quarter of 2012 unrevised \u2013 confounding City forecasts that the increase would be cut to 0.9%, and confirming that the recession has ended. Officials said the boost provided by the London Olympic Games helped household spending to rise by 0.6% in the July to September period, its fastest growth since the second quarter of 2010. A 3.7% increase in investment spending and a better trade performance also boosted gross domestic product. Tuesday's data confirms that national output bounced back during the summer following the fall in the second quarter caused by the extra bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The ONS said the economy was 0.1% smaller at the end of the third quarter than it had been a year earlier, and shrank by 3.1% from its pre-recession peak in early 2008. Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, warned earlier this month that growth was likely to falter again in the final three months of 2012 as the one-off factors that drove activity in the third quarter faded away. Business surveys have confirmed that the pace of growth during the summer will not be maintained in the fourth quarter. Vicky Redwood, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said that once special factors were taken into account the economy had been \"pretty flat\" in the third quarter. \"Indeed, with the fading of the Olympic boost likely to weigh on GDP in the fourth quarter, the [Bank of England's] monetary policy committee has said that it is braced for a contraction \u2013 which is what we expect.

Panmure Gordon's Simon French was more negative, saying current trading was disappointing and issuing a sell note: The market thinks M&amp;B represents good value because the PE is low at 9.8 times but the adjusted enterprise value/EBITDAR of 7.7 times is a premium to managed pub and restaurant peers. The market seems content to ignore that the group has a \u00a3400m and more pension deficit, returns are below weighted average cost of capital and, unusually for a pub company, it trades at a premium of around 25% to its net asset value. Combined with our caution on the UK consumer for the next 12 months we reiterate our sell recommendation and 225p target price.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The west's leading economic thinktank has forecast Britain's economy will contract by less than feared this year but warned recovery will be slow and uncertain against a worsening international backdrop. In its half-yearly forecasts, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the global slowdown, the eurozone crisis, the government's deficit reduction programme and the paying down of consumer debt were all acting as a brake on growth. The OECD said it expected UK national output to shrink by 0.1% this year, a less gloomy prediction than the 0.7% contraction it had pencilled in back in August before news of the 1% expansion in activity in the third quarter of 2012. \"Growth is projected to recover gradually and gain momentum towards the end of 2013, as exports and household spending pick up as confidence recovers\", the thinktank said in its economic outlook. The OECD, which has 34 rich country members, added: \"Although employment grew strongly in 2012, unemployment is expected to rise slightly in 2013, as the subdued recovery and continued uncertainty may make firms hesitant to hire.\" In its healthcheck of the UK, the OECD said it would back George Osborne if the weakness of the economy forced him to slow down his debt-reduction plans. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to report next week that Osborne will need fresh austerity measures to hit his target of reducing the national debt as a share of gross domestic product by 2015-16. The OECD said the chancellor should allow in-built stabilising mechanisms to work to support demand even if this meant slippage in his plans. \"With the fiscal deficit and public debt still high, the policy of fiscal consolidation remains appropriate to ensure the sustainability of the public finances\", the outlook said. \"In the event of lower than expected growth, the flexibility of the fiscal mandate should be utilised to allow the automatic stabilisers to continue to operate, even though this may imply pushing out the debt target.\" It added that continued weakness in the global economy \u2013 expected to persist for the next two years \u2013 together with \"deep but necessary\" deficit reduction were acting as a drag on growth. A drop in the value of the pound had failed to rebalance the economy because the crisis in the euro zone had hit exports. Although the OECD said low wage increases and part-time working had limited job losses, it expressed concern about the high level of youth unemployment and said this could worsen if the economy faltered. Unemployment is forecast to rise to 8.3% in 2013, against a backdrop of 0.9% growth. The pace of expansion is expected to pick up to 1.6% in 2014. The OECD's chief economist, Pier Carlo Padoan, said: \"After five years of crisis, the global economy is weakening again\", adding that the risk of a \"major new contraction\" could not be ruled out. \"The US economy is growing but performance remains below what was expected earlier this year. A slowdown has surfaced in many emerging market economies, partly reflecting the impact of the recession in Europe\", Padoan said. The thinktank said it was concerned that many of its rich-country members were at or below \"stall speed\", a slowing of economic activity that in the past has signalled a recession to come. It believes the pace of growth will slow from 2.2% to 2% in the US in 2013, Japan's expansion will drop from 1.6% in 2012 to 0.7% in 2013 and that the eurozone will have a second straight year of falling output, 0.4% in 2012 and 0.1% in 2013. The OECD as a whole is expected to grow by just 1.4% in both 2012 and 2013, with unemployment rising from 8% to 8.2%. While predicting a \"hesitant and uneven recovery\", the OECD said the high downside risks meant the outcome could be much worse. It is assuming the eurozone crisis does not intensify, that the US does not step over the fiscal cliff, that there will be no major disturbance to push up oil prices and that \"prolonged sub-par growth will not make economies stall under the weight of confidence losses, rising uncertainty and declining spending.\"",

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney the surprise choice as Bank of England governor", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne sprang a surprise on the City on Monday when he put Canada's central bank chief in charge of the Bank of England. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada, is largely unknown outside the cloistered circles of central bankers and financial regulators, but has gained a reputation as a tough operator able to confront leading banks at the heart of the financial crisis. The chancellor said Carney would bring a wealth of experience to the job, which from next year will include acting as the City's top watchdog alongside setting interest rates and monetary policy. MPs on all sides of the House welcomed the appointment, with many arguing that he was capable of taming the City and preventing a repeat of the financial crisis. On Monday night Carney told a press conference in Ottawa: \"I'm going to where the challenges are greatest,\"stressing the need to \"rebalance\" the economy which has relied heavily on a financial services sector hit by huge losses and scandals. \"It's very important for the global economy that the UK does well, that it succeeds in this rebalancing of their economy, that the reform of the British financial system is completed,\" he said. As well as being the first non-Briton, Carney, who will earn \u00a3305,000 a year, is the first governor in the Bank's history to be chosen after an open recruitment process, in which the role was advertised and candidates interviewed by a panel. Osborne said he had recommended Carney to David Cameron, who in turn recommended him to the Queen for appointment. The chancellor said Carney was \"the outstanding central banker of his generation with unparalleled expertise in financial regulation\". He told MPs: \"He will bring a fresh perspective. He has got what it takes to help bring families and businesses through these incredibly challenging economic times. My responsibility was to get the best for Britain, and with Mark Carney we've got that.\" Born in Canada, the 47-year-old intends to bring his British wife and four children to the UK and apply for citizenship. But he rejected the Treasury's stipulation that the new governor serve for a single eight-year term in favour of a contract that runs for only five years. In appointing a foreign national to the top job at the Bank of England, Osborne rejected several high-profile British candidates, including the deputy governor and frontrunner for the job, Paul Tucker, and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Adair Turner. Tucker said : \"I warmly congratulate Mark Carney on his appointment to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor.\" Tucker undermined his chances of promotion with a poor performance in front of MPs on the Treasury select committee after becoming embroiled with disgraced Barclays boss Bob Diamond during the Libor interest rate fixing scandal. Turner was considered an outsider following his close association with the previous Labour administration. The only known woman candidate from the secret, five-person list, MEP Sharon Bowles, was considered to be lacking experience despite several years as head of the monetary and economic committee in the European parliament. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, was quick to praise Osborne's decision to pursue Carney, who repeatedly denied that he was interested in the job, saying he had worked with Carney on several occasions and found him to be an impressive character who is well qualified to take on the role. Labour backbench MPs joined the chorus of approval, with one describing Carney as a breath of fresh air. City analysts said that while they were surprised by the appointment, Canada's ability to survive the financial crash had boosted the status of its central bank boss. His promotion last year to head the G20 financial stability board, which is charged with forcing the world's major banks to agree and implement global standards, also elevated him to the top rank of financial regulators. Carney said he had strong ties to the UK, not only through his wife's family, but also from working here for a decade and making contacts with UK businesses and financial institutions over recent years. He said: \"I think I can play a constructive role in relaunching the institution in its new role in promoting financial stability and the regulation of financial services.\" The chairman of the Treasury select committee, Andrew Tyrie, welcomed the appointment of an \"extremely talented and experienced choice\". But there will be some who question why an outsider with little in-depth knowledge of the UK economy should take on the country's most powerful regulatory job. There is also the day-to-day management of monetary policy as head of the nine-strong monetary policy committee, which has eight economists who have a much deeper and broader knowledge of the business culture and economic quirks of the UK economy. Canada, like Sweden, is credited with surviving the financial crash largely unscathed, though both countries suffered crippling economic crises in the early 1990s, which led to them putting strong regulations in place. Osborne wants Carney to carry through a series of structural reforms to City regulation. The Bank of England will become the main regulator, taking responsibility for making sure the financial system becomes robust enough to withstand a crash of the same magnitude as the one of 2008. Osborne said: \"It says something of Mark Carney's abilities that he was chosen by the world's financial regulators to run the global regulator, the financial stability board.\" Tyrie said MPs will interview Carney in a pre-appointment hearing: \"The hearing will cover not only his professional competence and personal independence, but also his experience, leadership qualities and views on the need to strengthen the governance and accountability of the Bank to parliament and to the public.\"",

      "bodyText": "The surprise appointment of Bank of Canada governor, Mark Carney, to lead the Bank of England has been received as a compliment and a loss in Canada.

      "bodyText": "Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister. That's all for now. Graeme will be back (later) in the morning to cover all the reaction to the deal. In the meantime, Ian Traynor has filed a piece from Brussels, which has gone online. Here's a snatch: European governments and the IMF sought to bury months of feuding over Greek debt levels in a tentative agreement that should see the release of up to \u20ac44bn in bailout funds needed to rescue Athens from insolvency. But after almost 12 hours of talks for the third time in a fortnight between eurozone finance ministers, leaders of the IMF, the European central bank and the European commission struggled to reach a consensus, suggesting a lack of confidence that the effort to resurrect the Greek economy will bear fruit or that three years of European bailout policy was working. The final question was taken by Juncker, who was asked what made him so positive that the GDP of Greece would be as calculated. He replied: We do strongly believe in the Greek capacity to recover. Greek people are courageous people. They are willing to bring their country back on the path of growth. We are agreeing amongst ourselves that in the next current mid terms financial review, more financial means will be dedicated to Greece. Two final points from the eurogroup statement: \u2022 Greece will get 44bn euros of aid under the plan, but the funding will be unlocked in three stages -- with payments linked to performance targets \u2022 The The Eurogroup expects to formally decide on the disbursement by 13 December, subject to national parliaments giving their approval, where necessary. As usual there has been plenty of praise for Greece's sacrifices. Olli Rehn, who was discussing the deal alongside other key players (including Jean-Claude Juncker and Lagarde) at the press conference in Brussels said Greece had met its obligations, so it was vital that the eurogroup had not failed. Juncker said the political agreement hammered out in Brussels was \"not just about money\" but would mean a \"better future for Greece as a whole\" In a nutshell, says Graeme, the plan is designed to put Greece on a path to debt sustainability again. As reported earlier, Athens must cut its debt to 124% of GDP by 2020 (not 120% as previously), and then to substantially lower than 110% in 2022. Eurozone countries have agreed four key points: \u2022 A lowering by 100 bps of the interest rate charged to Greece on the loans provided in the context of the Greek Loan Facility. Member States under a full financial assistance programme are not required to participate in the lowering of the GLF interest rates for the period in which they receive themselves financial assistance. \u2022 A lowering by 10 bps of the guarantee fee costs paid by Greece on the EFSF loans. \u2022 An extension of the maturities of the bilateral and EFSF loans by 15 years and a deferral of interest payments of Greece on EFSF loans by 10 years. These measures will not affect the creditworthiness of EFSF, which is fully backed by the guarantees from Member States. \u2022 A commitment by Member States to pass on to Greece's segregated account, an amount equivalent to the income on the SMP portfolio accruing to their national central bank as from budget year 2013. Member States under a full financial assistance programme are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive themselves financial assistance. A statement has been issued by the IMF welcomes Eurogroup agreement to support the Greek reform program. In it, Lagarde says that the initiatives agreed today by the Eurogroup include Greek debt buybacks, return of Securities Market Programme (SMP) profits to Greece, reduction of Greek Loan Facility (GLF) interest rates, significant extension of GLF and European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) maturities, and the deferral of EFSF interest rate payments. She adds: Taken together, these measures will help to bring back Greece\u2019s debt ratio to a sustainable path and facilitate a gradual return to market financing. She described the commitment by negotiators to bring back Greece's debt to substantially below 110 percent of GDP by 2022 as \"a major debt reduction for Greece relative to its current debt trajectory\". The press conference is under way, with IMF chief Christine Lagarde telling bleary-eyed hacks that Greece had to be back in a sustainable path. \"I can tell you tonight that this has been achieved,\" she says. Meanwhile, Peter Spiegel of the Financial Times isn't convinced that the eurogroup has made a major breakthrough: As we wait for the press conference in Brussels, Graeme Wearden (who should be relaxing at home) points out that there are three key questions about any deal: 1. What are Greece's new bailout targets? Leaked documents have show that the old one -debt of 120% of GDP by 2020, was unachievable without significant debt relief. 2. Does Greece get its aid tranche, and how much? Originally Athens was to receive 31.5bn, but the delays means other payments are now due - so the total package could be 44bn 3. Who pays? Will the ECB give up some 'profits' on its Greek bonds. Will lenders accept lower interest rates. Is an official haircut on Greek bonds held by euro governments and central banks still off the table? At the very least some sort of Eurogroup press conference is being touted up for livestreaming here tonight. A note of caution on that deal. There are some doubts about what, if anything, has been agreed. The Zero Hedge site tweets: However, discussions are continuing on details of the measures to reduce Athens' debt burden, says Reuters, which notes that the euro strengthened slightly against the dollar after news of a deal emerged. Here's a quote to the agency from an unnamed offical: It's going very slow, but we have financing and a Debt Sustainability Analysis. We've filled the financing gap until the end of program in 2014. Officials have confirmed that the agreement on a new debt target for Greece following talks involving Eurozone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund has been clinched, reports Reuters. The news agency adds: After nearly 10 hours of wrangling at their third meeting on the issue in as many weeks, Greece's international lenders agreed to reduce Greek debt by 40 billion euros to 124 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 through a package of steps. The deal opens the way for a major aid installment needed to recapitalize Greece's teetering banks and enable the government to pay wages, pensions and suppliers in December. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog now. Finally, sighs of white smoke in Brussels, with several reports that the eurogroup and the IMF have reached some kind of deal over Greece's debt programme. Full details aren't available yet, but apparently the new measures agreed between euro finance ministers and the IMF would see Greek's debt pile drop to 124% of GDP by 2020. That's above the 120% target which the IMF had previously been sticking too - suggesting it has given some ground. It's also not clear if this is enough to unlock all the aid Greece is waiting for (up to a maximum of 44bn euros). But it looks like the long-awaited breakthrough ... The word from Brussels is that the talks over Greece's finances are, once again, going to drag long into the evening. If there are any dramatic developments we'll update the blog -- otherwise I'll be back early on Tuesday morning to pick up the action. Until then, thanks all and goodnight! Trading has closed on Wall Street, where the uncertainty over Greece helped to send shares sliding a little. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 42 points lower at 12967. Still no progress in Brussels... and in Greece SKAI TV reporting that talks are on a knife's edge SKAI's journalist is describing atmosphere inside PM's office (outside which he is standing) as \"anguished.\" The prime minister Antonis Samaras is following the talks \"minute by minute\" and is in constant contact with finance minister Yiannis Stournaras, according to the channel's flaghshp news programme. Dimitris Tsiodras, an analyst and former government spokesman, has told the station that he thinks that: If a definitive solution cannot be found to the problem of Greek debt tonight, a window will be left open to find a solution later. The IMF want a solution tonight. There is a real possibility that it will withdraw tonight [from the country's troika of creditors] until a solution is found ... in that case I expect [the meeting] to produce a political solution regarding the [next tranche of rescue funds] but that will cause problems for the government. (that's via Helena Smith) Greece's Mega TV flagship news programme was reporting this evening that government officials are now describing the euro group negotiations as \"very difficult,\" Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith says: Aides to prime minister Antonis Samaras are saying they expect \"a very long night\" with the likelihood of a decision being made looking increasingly unlikely. At the centre of the deadlock, according to the channel, is the inability of both the IMF and EU to agree on ways to make the country's debt load sustainable by bringing it down to 120 per cent of GDP by 2020. \"Both sides are standing their ground with the IMF in particular refusing to budge and wanting a complete solution on the issue,\" Maria Spyraki, a senior Mega reporter, told listeners from outside the prime minister's office. Citing IMF officials in Washington the channel said the orgnaisation is insisting that at the very least it be given a \"guarantee\" of a haircut being made in the future to reduce the face value of Greece's debt mountain. There's a very odd scene in Brussels tonight \u2013 farmers unhappy about milk prices and quotas have blockaded the streets with tractors. Irate farmers also sprayed milk at the European parliament, and set light to hay bales: Interesting.... Reuters is reporting that the International Monetary Fund is pushing eurozone finance ministers to cut Greece's debt pile by \u20ac40bn According to a source, the IMF wants Greece's debt pile cut by an amount equal to 20% of GDP to get debt sustainability back on track. That would 'mainly be achieved' by tinkering with interest rate and maturity dates, apparently. The full story is online here: IMF wants 40 bln euro cut in Greek debt, more later-source However, it's caused some confusion among the press pack (who are getting understandably unamused by today's lack of progress). And the Telegraph's Bruno Waterfield confirms that the eurogroup is bogged down.... It's now seven hours since the eurogroup meeting began in Brussels, and there is no sign of progress. Indeed, it sounds like another European meeting where little gets agreed. From the scene, our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports that tempers are fraying: European markets have closed, and with the eurogroup discussions on Greece still going on, they have drifted lower. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished down 32.42 points at 5786.72, a 0.56% decline \u2022 Germany's Dax is 0.23% lower \u2022 France's Cac has closed 0.79% down \u2022 Spain's Ibex is off 0.44% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB has lost 0.74% \u2022 And across the Atlantic, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 100 points lower There's been some debate as to whether the Greek prime minister did indeed warn the country's government could collapse without a decision on its aid tranche. It was apparently said as part of a telephone conversation. And now we have the denial. Our correspondent Helena Smith writes: A government spokesman has just made an announcement denying purported statements by prime minister Antonis Samaras regarding the stability of his coalition resting on a successful result at today's euro group. In a rare move the government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou rejected \"rumours\" that prime minister Antonis Samaras had made the statement. A statement released from the press ministry said: regarding \"rumours\" about the prime minister's so called message to the euro group published in Greece and republished by certain international media, the government spokesman has made the following statement. \"Many well-intentioned people put words in the mouth of the pirme minister and finance minister which have never been said. At such a critical time everyone should pay attention to what they say and write.\": UK prime minister David Cameron is making his statement on last week's - collapsed - EU budget summit. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering it here. In a shock move, the UK government has announced that Mark Carney, Canada's central bank boss, will become the next governor of the Bank of England. Favourite Paul Tucker, the current Bank deputy, did not get a look in. For all the latest reaction to the appointment, our live blog is here. France held its first debt auction since Moody's stripped the country of its Triple A rating last week. And it went pretty well. It sold \u20ac6.782bn worth of 13, 24, and 50 week bills with yields on the first two falling deeping into negative territory. Demand was strong with total bids worth more than three times the amount on offer. And to ratchet up the pressure on the eurogroup, Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has reportedly said the country's government may collapse if it does not get a decision on the \u20ac31.5bn loan tranche today. Earlier we reported how Samaras had been working the phones over the weekend to help get an agreement. Hopes of an early decision are fading, it seems. In a frankly alarming development, Herman Van Rompuy has just composed another haiku -- and the European Council president does not sounds like a happy chap. He tweets: This is Van Rompuy's first contribution to Twitter since the EU Summit collapsed on Friday afternoon without a deal (or much progress) on the European Union budget. Perhaps the criticism heaped on HVR's head \u2013 such as the #rompuyshambles on Twitter \u2013 has got to him. Perhaps it's a sign. Or perhaps it simply reflects that autumn is depressing. I'm moving over to live blog the announcement of the next Bank of England governor, so my colleague Nick Fletcher will hold the fort here. Germany's deputy finance minister Steffen Kampeter has reiterated his opposition to a new Greek debt restructuring - telling a conference that every nation, apart from Greece, dislikes the idea of Official Sector Involvement in the country's restructuring. Bloomberg's Linda Yueh has the details: Kampeter was also upbeat about the eurogroup meeting, saying: I see a very good chance for a deal tonight. Over on the FT, Peter Spiegel has uploaded an official chart which shows Greece's financing needs and how its debt mountain would fall under various scenarios.The most important part is the third column, which shows how Greece's debt/GDP ratio is on track to be 144% by 2020, not the target set under its bailout. The bottom figure in that chart shows that it would still be 128% of GDP even if some Greek debt were bought back, and if the interest rate on its bonds were cut. In other words, the only way to hit the 120% target in 2020 would be for creditors to write off some debt. (which is why delaying the deadline to 2022 is so appealing) A high-quality (more legible) version is online here... while Peter outlines the various options on the table here: Greece, round 3: Let the debt relief talks begin We now have pictures of ministers and top officials arriving at today's Eurogroup meeting (see 12.08pm for some of the quotes thrown to a ravenous press pack): Stepping outside the eurozone briefly - news has just broken in the UK that the next Bank of England governor will be announced at 3.30pm. Paul Tucker, the current deputy governor, is the favourite.... The WSJ's Matina Stevis reports that the eurogroup meeting began with Ireland's Michael Noonan declaring that the eurozone was united and the IMF must make the first move towards a solution.... Angela Merkel's spokesman, Stefan Seibert, dampened hopes of a major breakthrough today by telling reporters in Berlin that the eurogroup would not even discuss the idea of writing off some Greek debt. Ian Traynor, our Europe editor, fears that today's Eurogroup meeting could be a lengthy affair. From Brussels, he reports that there is little sign that the divisions between the eurozone and the IMF over Greece's have narrowed. If the two sides cannot agree on Greece's debt sustainability \u2013 namely what debt/GDP level Greece must hit, and when, then the meeting could last until midnight. No wonder Jean-Claude Juncker brought an overnight bag (see 9.58am)... Or the decision could be delayed again until the next meeting on December 5th. Going into the Eurogroup meeting a few minutes ago, Christine Lagarde declared that a credible solution for Greece must be found. Some finance ministers sounded optimistic as they arrived, but others took a cautious line. Here's a round-up of comments made to the press pack: Christine Lagarde We are going to work towards a solution that is credible for Greece, that is what is important. It must be credible and it must really be about Greece, and so we are going to work very intensely on that. European commissioner Olli Rehn I want to encourage all the euro area member states and the IMF to go the last mile in order to find an agreement, in fact go the last centimetre because we are so close to an agreement. This is essential now, and Greece has delivered. Now it is delivery time for the Eurogroup and the IMF. Spanish finance minister Luis de Guindos I think we are very close, we need to agree on Greece's debt level. It is crucial to reach agreement, it would be a message of confidence, not just for Greece, but for the whole euro zone. It is important to send out a clear political message. Austria's finance minister, Maria Fekter: We have the serious intent to come to a conclusion, on the one hand about the financing, and on the other hand regarding the plan of sustainable Greek debt. There are still talks with the IMF and we could decide on paying out the tranche today. Greece has made a huge effort, it has lived up to all the conditions and we have nothing to criticise, so we have to make an effort to come to a joint solution. The Eurogroup meeting is now getting underway in Brussels - marking the third attempt by euro area finance ministers to close the divisions with the International Monetary Fund over Greece. Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith reports that officials are expressing \"cautious optimism\" that the riddle of rescue funds for the debt-stricken country will finally be resolved at today\u2019s euro group meeting. Helena writes: In sign that success is far from assured officials close to prime minister Antonis Samaras and finance minister Yiannis Stournaras are unwilling to voice anything more than \u201ccautious optimism\u201d that today\u2019s meeting will yield the longed-for result. A senior aide to Stournaras put it this way. \u201cEverything is open. Nothing is certain. The general feeling is, you could say, one of very cautious optimism.\u201d Samaras, who says disbursement of the long-overdue \u20ac31.5bn aid tranche is \u201curgent\u201d if recession-hit Greece is to be put on the road to \u201ceconomic recovery,\u201d has apparently been working the phones holding talks with counterparts and senior EU mandarins over the weekend. The well-informed daily Ta Nea says he also called IMF chief Christine Lagarde in a bid to break the Gordion knot of Greece\u2019s debt sustainability \u2013 the source of continuing friction between the Washington-based body and the EU. If there is one thing that Athens\u2019 governing coalition and main opposition Syriza party agree on, it is the need for the country\u2019s monumental debt load to finally be tackled with both sides pointing out that even if today\u2019s euro group gives the green light for \u20ac446bn to be disbursed (which would include other bailout loans owed to Greece this year), more than half of that amount would go towards recapitalizing the Greek banking system to make up for losses incurred with the write-down of private sector bonds earlier this year. The longer the delay in loans, the more difficult things become for a government now acutely aware that on the back of growing anti-austerity sentiment the radical left Syriza is surging ahead in the polls. Indicatively, party insiders tell me that a growing number of EU ambassadors have privately sought meetings with Alexis Tsipras, the Syriza leader, with the British ambassador holding long talks with the young politician this morning clearly in a bid to sound out his views. The other big eurozone event of the weekend, the regional elections in Catalonia, have caused plenty of head-scratching this morning. The raw facts are that the Catalan president who has been driving the campaign for independence actually lost seats in the region's parliament. Artur Mas's CiU won 50 seats, down from 62. However the separatist Esquerra party grabbed 21 of the 135 seats on offer, putting it in second place, while other separatist parties also gained ground. What does that mean for the campaign for an independent Catalonia? Our Martin Roberts reports here that the voters have dealt a blow to Mas's hopes of an independence referendum. Reuters agrees, saying it will be harder to co-ordinate a pro-independence movement with CiU weakened. And Open Europe, the think tank, says it's hard to predict how the situation will develop, but makes three key points: 1) any referendum bid would still face legal challenges from Madrid 2) it's unclear how Catalonia would manage a break-away, given Madrid's opposition 3) Catalonia would not be a member of the EU, and Spain could block any membership bid. Over in Italy, Silvio Berlusconi has declared that he is giving serious consideration to running in next year's elections. Berlusconi told his own Canale 5 TV channel, with typical insouciance, that he was pondering whether he could still make a contribution to Italian politics: I think that it's right for someone who had the honour of leading the Italian government for almost 10 years to reflect on the way to achieve this modernisation of Italy, this liberal revolution. The former PM also laid into current leader Mario Monti, saying his austerity packages had plunged Italy into recession [even though the Italian economy was already shrinking when Monti took over] The comments came after an inconclusive primary election to select the next leader of the centre left Democratic Party, which currently leads the opinion polls. The voting put two men, current party secretary Pier Luigi Bersani, 61, and Florence mayor Matteo Renzi, 37, into a run-off on December 2nd. Our correspondent in Rome, Tom Kington, explains all: While the markets may want Monti to be asked back to lead a coalition government next Spring, neither Bersani or Renzi like the idea even if they back his bid to reform the Italian economy. And a new poll published on Monday showed 39% of Italians will not vote for a government that seeks to push on with the same austerity policies Monti enacted. Only four percent said they definitely would. Bersani led the first round of voting yesterday with about 45% to Renzi\u2019s 35.5%, and is a favourite to win the run-off. But if Bersani is the preferred candidate of Democratic Party members, Renzi would likely draw more right wing and centrist voters in a general election, which could give the party a real majority. With Bersani on the ticket, the party could forced into a coalition with centrist partners demanding Monti\u2019s return. As for Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s chronic indecision about standing again, Bersani said yesterday, \u201cHe is always in the changing room, with one boot laced up and the other unlaced.\u201d Over in Slovakia, teachers have begun a strike in protest at the government's refusal to give them a 10% pay rise. Most state-run schools are shut, according to AP, and there are demonstrations in several cities. The Slovakian government has refused to offer a pay rise above 5%, saying it can't pay anymore as it tried to cut its deficit to below 3% of GDP next year (as Brussels demands). Slovakian teachers are unhappy that they earn less than the average wage, and are paid less than their counterparts in other OECD countries (the inflation rate, incidentally, is running at 3.9%). Slovakia had to implement tough economic measures to qualify for eurozone membership - today's strike indicates that tensions are growing across the country as it suffers the impact of the economic downturn. Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the Eurogroup of euro finance ministers, has just arrived for today's meeting (which is expected to start in a little over one hours time). That's via Matina Stevis of the Wall Street Journal, who also reports that the Luxembourg PM was carrying an 'overnight bag' - not a good sign for those of us hoping for a quick meeting. In Ireland, public opposition to the country's austerity programme is growing - with 10,000 people marching in Dublin on Saturday to voice their opposition to another tough budget. The Irish government is expected to hit the public with further tax hikes and spending cuts when it publishes the 2013 budget on December 5. Saturday's march, organised by a group of unions and community group, was designed to put pressure on Dublin to change course: AP reports that the parade mixed darker themes with \"gallows humour\": A rider on horseback in white mask and black cape depicting Death led the parade, while the horse had a \"no to austerity\" banner round its neck. On placards Irish leaders were portrayed as serpents, with pleas to St. Patrick to return and banish them from Ireland. Marchers donned Santa hats, some bearing the slogan \"No no no!\" rather than ho ho ho, and warned that the government wanted to play Grinch and steal Christmas. Just in - consumer confidence in Italy has tumbled to its lowest level in at least 16 years. ISTAT's monthly index of consumer sentiment slumped to 84.8, down from 86.2 in October. That's the weakest reading since the survey began in 1996. The financial markets are subdued this morning ahead of the Greek talks, with the main indices all falling by 0.2%-0.4%. The FTSE 100 is currently down 11 points at 5807. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, commented: Optimism is tempered ahead of the Eurogroup meeting in Brussels, despite heightened expectations that finance chiefs/troika of bailout lenders will reach an agreement and give Greece the money it needs to avoid default and remove what has been more than a nagging doubt for some time now. On Saturday, eurozone finance ministers held a telephone conference call to discuss today's eurogroup meeting on Greece. They didn't release a statement afterwards - but France's Pierre Moscovici was in good spirits last night, saying a solution was 'very close'. Moscovici also suggested that policymakers would have to buy back some Greek debt, cut the interest rate on its loans, and persuade the ECB to surrender profits on its Greek bonds, in order to make the country's debts sustainable again. It's now 18 days since the Greek parliament approved the \u20ac13.5bn of austerity measures demanded by the Troika in return for its bailout programme. And understandably, Athens officials are becoming impatient with the lengthy arguing between the eurozone and the IMF. One senior Finance Ministry source told Skai TV: God forbid that we should not be close to an agreement for Monday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis. For the third time in as many weeks, eurozone finance ministers will meet with the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank today to try to agree a deal on Greece's bailout programme. The Eurogroup meeting in Brussels is the latest attempt to find a credible way to reduce Greece's debt pile and unlock aid payment worth up to \u20ac44bn, which the Greek government desperately needs. Both previous meetings have floundered over the issue of how long Greece should be given to bring its debt down, and how to finance the two-year extension that Athens needs to hit its bailout targets. Having agreed more painful austerity measures in recent weeks, Greece is now crossing its fingers and waiting for its international partners to reach agreement. A deal could come today. But there are already murmurings that the issue could roll onto the next eurogroup meeting in early December. Fortunately, the meeting starts at noon Brussels time (11am GMT), meaning we should be spared an all-nighter. I'll be tracking the action in Brussels today, as well as other key issues across the eurozone and the world economy. That will include political developments in Spain and Italy, following regional elections in Catalonia and a ballot to choose a leader of the Italian centre-left.",

      "bodyText": "European governments and the IMF sought to bury months of feuding over Greek debt levels in a tentative agreement that should see the release of up to \u20ac44bn in bailout funds needed to rescue Athens from insolvency. But after almost 12 hours of talks for the third time in a fortnight between eurozone finance ministers, leaders of the IMF, the European central bank and the European commission struggled to reach a consensus, suggesting a lack of confidence that the effort to resurrect the Greek economy will bear fruit or that three years of European bailout policy was working. The meeting agreed to shave projected Greek debt to allow it to level at 124% of GDP by 2020, entailing a 20% cut in Greek debt by the deadline. With the IMF demanding a writedown of Greece's debt by its official eurozone creditors and Germany leading the resistance to such a move, declaring it illegal, the meeting agreed on a mixture of measures involving debt buybacks, lower interest rates on loans, longer maturity periods on borrowing, and ECB returns to Greece of profits on its holdings of Greek bonds. In an increasingly arcane dispute entailing sophisticated number-crunching over recent weeks, the IMF had stuck to a bottom line of getting the Greek debt level to 120% by 2020, far below what eurozone and IMF inspectors concluded was possible. A debt sustainability analysis last week said the debt level would be 144% without eurozone action to write much of it off. The Europeans hoped to extend the IMF-set 2020 deadline for debt \"sustainability\" by two years, but Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, stuck to the 2020 date. While Berlin played for more time, until after next year's general election and the expiry of Greece's formal bailout schedule in 2014, the IMF has been demanding a clear, credible longer-term programme. Greece met the terms for the bailout funds a couple of weeks ago, agreeing a budget and swingeing spending cuts. Eurozone loans of at least \u20ac31.5bn have been pending since last summer, but held up recently by arguments not between Athens and its creditors, but by disputes among the creditors. Greece, where the eurozone's debt crisis erupted in late 2009, is the currency area's most heavily indebted country, despite a big \"haircut\" this year on privately-held bonds. Its economy has shrunk by nearly 25 percent in five years. The key question remains whether Greek debt can become sustainable without eurozone governments having to write off some of the loans they have made to Athens. A source familiar with IMF thinking said the global lender was demanding immediate measures to cut Greece's debt by 20 percentage points of GDP, with a commitment to do more to reduce the debt stock in a few years if Greece fulfils its programme. To reduce the debt to 124% by 2020, the ministers were putting together a package of steps including a debt buyback funded by a eurozone rescue fund, reducing the interest rate on loans and returning eurozone central bank 'profits' back to Greece. Germany and its northern European allies have so far rejected any idea of forgiving official loans to Athens. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told reporters that a debt cut was legally impossible if it was linked to a new guarantee of loans. \"You cannot guarantee something if you're cutting debt at the same time,\" he said.",
