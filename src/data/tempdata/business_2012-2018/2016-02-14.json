      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s banks are vulnerable to a global financial shock despite efforts to shore up their finances, according to the official who led the inquiry into the safety of UK banks following the 2008 crash. Sir John Vickers, who led the Independent Commission on Banking, said: \u201cThe Bank of England proposal is less strong than what the ICB recommended.\u201d Vickers, a former Bank of England chief economist, said Threadneedle Street had watered down the proposals put forward by the ICB, leaving it without the necessary financial buffers to continue operating when avenues to fresh funds dried up. The warning came as China\u2019s financial authorities were poised to spend billions of pounds propping up the Shanghai stock market after a week in which fears of a 2008-style banking crash resurfaced. The Shanghai exchange, which will reopen on Monday following a long shutdown for Chinese New Year, will come under pressure from nervous traders amid concerns that a steep fall in stock market values this year is a harbinger of a broader global economic slump. Investors fear that low inflation and the waning power of central banks to generate growth could push the eurozone back into recession and damage several of Europe\u2019s biggest banks. In what appeared to be a coordinated move ahead of the Chinese market\u2019s reopening, the chief of China\u2019s central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, played down concerns over the state of the country\u2019s finances, which he said remained robust and plentiful enough to withstand economic shocks. A senior official at the European Central Bank also issued a statement reassuring investors that Greek banks were secure from the turmoil following their rescue by the ECB last summer. Political unrest in Greece and the possibility of a re-run of last year\u2019s eurozone crisis, when Athens was almost pushed out of the euro, have played a role in destabilising stock and bond markets. Falling oil prices and persistently low inflation have also signalled that the global recovery is petering out. Central banks have responded by cutting interest rates to spur bank lending and growth. Some, including the Swedish and Japanese central banks, have brought in negative interest rates, in effect charging commercial banks to deposit money with them in a desperate attempt to make them lend it to businesses and households. Vickers, who is now the warden of All Souls College, Oxford, told the BBC that more capital is needed, because the nature and scale of the next financial shock is uncertain. \u201cA good way to think about it is as an insurance policy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do have to pay a premium to insure your house and you hope nothing bad will happen. But if it does, you are much better off in paying that premium, and for full coverage. \u201cIf banks run out of capital, all sorts of havoc could ensue. We want to be in a position where there\u2019s enough of a buffer to take any losses that might occur.\u201d He said the Bank of England should rethink its recent announcement about the amount of capital that banks need to hold. Vickers was referring to a recommendation by the ICB that banks should hold a 3% buffer for so-called systemic risks, while, he said, the Bank\u2019s recent proposals were not requiring this. Earlier, in a comment piece for the Financial Times, he said: \u201cGiven the awfulness of systemic bank failures, ample insurance is needed, and equity is the best form of insurance. The recent volatility in banks underlines the importance of strong capital buffers. The BoE should think again.\u201d The Bank would not comment on Vickers\u2019 warning, although Martin Taylor, the former Barclays chief executive who sat on the ICB inquiry panel, recently told MPs he was happy with the rules. Now a policymaker at the Bank, Taylor said: \u201cThere is still a heck of a gap, as you rightly point out, between 13% and the Vickers commission\u2019s 18%, but the Vickers commission was operating on the assumption that there would not be bail-in-able debt, if I can put it that way, which we now have or shall shortly have.\u201d Bank shares have plunged following concerns that they will find it difficult to generate profits while interest rates remain low, or turn further into negative territory. Increasing competition among banks for new business over recent months has combined with the increasing cost of raising funds, squeezing profit margins. Much of the focus has been on Deutsche Bank, which tried to reassure investors about its financial position last week, including a move by its chief executive, John Cryan, to declare that the bank is \u201crock solid\u201d and embark on a \u00a33.7bn buy-back of its debt. Although stock markets bounced back on Friday, they remain markedly lower in the year. Shares in UK banks are down: Standard Chartered is at 25-year lows and HSBC is at 2009 levels. The Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, told senators on Capitol Hill this week that the path to higher interest rates in the US may be less steep than previously thought, given the broad market sell-off. She also refused to rule out a reversal of policy and a move back to near-zero rates should the US economy, which has stalled in recent months, suffer a longer period of low growth. Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, has hinted that he will extend the current negative interest policy at a meeting of officials in Frankfurt next month. The UK is expected to report on Tuesday that inflation remained near zero and well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target. Canada, China and the US will also report inflation figures this week, setting the tone for the global economy.",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel\u2019s European boss will join thousands of steelworkers on Monday in a protest against \u201cunfair\u201d practices by Chinese firms, amid rising diplomatic tension with the People\u2019s Republic. Karl Koehler will take to the streets in Brussels as part of a demonstration against what Tata Steel called a \u201cflood of unfairly traded imports into Europe\u201d. More than 5,000 steelworkers are expected to march through the Belgian capital on the same day as business ministers, including Anna Soubry from the UK, meet in the city to discuss a remedy. The steel industry is demanding a tougher stance by the EU against Chinese steel firms \u201cdumping\u201d cheap steel on to the EU market. They will call for European leaders to block China\u2019s bid to be granted market economy status (MES) by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a milestone that would make it harder to limit Chinese imports. The march has been triggered by a crisis in Europe\u2019s steel industry that has resulted in 5,000 job losses in the UK alone since last summer. Industry figures have blamed Chinese firms, which have responded to a domestic slowdown by offloading steel in Europe at below cost price, undercutting local producers. Koehler said: \u201cThe situation facing Tata Steel and other European steelmakers today is perilous. If the European commission does not take immediate and robust action, thousands of jobs in the industry \u2013 and many thousands more in the wider supply chain \u2013 will be threatened. \u201cWe are not asking for special treatment. Instead, we are asking for the European commission to stand up for fair trade and to give European steelmakers a chance to compete on a level playing field.\u201d European leaders have put forward proposals to raise tariffs on Chinese steel in the face of a surge in imports to the EU which have soared from 4.5m tonnes in 2014 to a projected figure of 7m tonnes for last year. The glut of steel has seen the price of hot rolled coil in northern Europe \u2013 an industry benchmark \u2013 slump from \u20ac600 (\u00a3465) per tonne last summer to about \u20ac350 (\u00a3270) per tonne. Efforts to shore up Europe\u2019s defences against cheap imports drew fire from China\u2019s commerce ministry. \u201cChina hopes the European commission will strictly abide by World Trade Organisation rules, show prudence and restraint and use trade remedy tools in accordance with the law,\u201d it said. The UK has refused to back European proposals that would allow for much higher tariffs on Chinese steel, but Soubry hailed the government\u2019s efforts. \u201cWe are taking action on energy costs, public procurement and industrial emissions at home to help the steel sector, but this is a global problem requiring a global solution. \u201cThis conference was convened thanks to UK efforts. We are working with other EU governments, industry leaders and trade unions to stress to the European commission the need for swifter investigations into dumping and the tariffs then being set at the right level,\u201d she said. Axel Eggert, director general of industry trade body Eurofer, said: \u201cThe march strikes at the heart of the challenges facing the European steel industry. We are staunch advocates for free and fair trade. Dumped steel imports from China, volumes of which have doubled in 18 months, are flooding the EU market and directly causing irreversible closures and job losses across the EU steel sector.\u201d Eggert added that China was not a market economy and to grant it MES when it did not meet either EU or WTO obligations would be wrong.",

      "bodyText": "A poll of British and German companies operating in the UK has found that almost a third would consider moving jobs out of the country following a vote to leave the European Union. In a survey of 700 businesses by the Bertelsmann Foundation, 29% of British and German companies polled said they would either reduce capacities in the UK or relocate altogether in the event of a Brexit. Businesses in the IT and technology sector are particularly open to upping sticks after a referendum: 41% say they would consider decreasing capacity or relocating. But even in the less mobile manufacturing sector, 26% of respondents said they would consider leaving Britain. Only 13% believed a Brexit could increase national employment levels. While the banking sector\u2019s support has already previously given strong indications of its support for a vote to stay, the survey by the Germany-based thinktank shows strong pro-EU sentiments across the entire business community. Four fifths of companies surveyed in retail, IT, manufacturing, energy, telecommunications and finance said the UK should remain in the EU. Manufacturing, IT and consumer/retail emerged as the most pro-EU sectors. Airline boss Carolyn McCall said at the weekend that a Brexit would raise the costs of foreign travel and mean that flying was \u201creserved for the elite\u201d. McCall, the chief executive of easyJet, said British influence inside Brussels was essential to minimise disruption and administration between countries and keep down the cost of air travel. For the survey, 404 UK-based and 378 German companies with operations in the UK were confronted with a \u201cbest-case\u201d scenario, where Britain would be able to depart the EU as a political entity but still retain access to the common market. \u201cGiven that we worked with such a \u2018soft\u2019 scenario, we were surprised to find how clear the pro-membership tendency was across British and German companies,\u201d said Ulrich Schoof, a senior project manager at the foundation. The Bertelsmann Stiftung, which holds a majority share in the media organisation by the same name, is generally seen as having a pro-European, free-market orientation. The survey confirms finance as the sector most pessimistic about the effect of Brexit on employment, investment and revenue, with negative predictions outweighing positive views by a factor of four to one. Big Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are major donors behind the campaign to remain in the EU. Many companies complained about burdens that came with EU membership, the most commonly cited burdens being complex regulation (34%) and uncertainty over the future of the euro (22%) \u2013 even though \u201ccomplex EU regulations\u201d appeared to bother UK companies (37%) more than German businesses (32%). Nonetheless, only 21% of companies surveyed believed Britain should leave the EU. \u201cMany small- and medium-sized companies complain about EU regulation\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Maier, the CEO of Siemens in the UK. \u201cBut what people tend to overlook is that smaller engineering companies are often producing parts used by bigger engineering companies like us and therefore have to comply with those regulations either way.\u201d Siemens employs 14,000 workers in UK, and claims that a further 24,000 jobs are linked to the company via its supply chain. \u201cYou could call Brexit a risk, but I prefer to talk about what would be better for us,\u201d Maier told the Guardian. \u201cDo I want a future where we survive in the UK or do I want a future where we thrive in the UK? \u201cOf course, there may be trade barriers for Britain if it left the EU. But more importantly: we want the UK to be able to set standards for new development, and we couldn\u2019t set those outside the UK. The same applies for research and development: you wouldn\u2019t be able to define research fields relevant for Siemens in Britain.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Workers making clothes for Marks &amp; Spencer in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India are still not being paid sufficiently, six years after the retailer promised to support the payment of a living wage in those countries. Under the British chain\u2019s Plan A environmental and social policy, it promised to \u201cimplement a process to ensure our suppliers are able to pay workers a fair living wage\u201d in the three south Asian countries. M&amp;S said its target was achieved in 2015. But a report by the workers\u2019 rights group Labour Behind the Label said workers from three factories in Sri Lanka, another three in India, and two in Bangladesh were all being paid well below the amount required for a decent standard of living. In Sri Lanka, basic pay averaged 13,500 Sri Lankan rupees a month (\u00a364), but campaigners say they need as much as 33,000 (\u00a3158). Workers spoken to for the report were mostly sharing single-room, tin-roofed houses with no access to running water. In India, workers were earning an average of 6,284 rupees (\u00a364) but thought they needed more than twice that for a decent living. Those interviewed said food and education expenses were difficult to meet on their wages and that most families shared toilet and tap water facilities with others. In Bangladesh, researchers only spoke to a small number of workers, but they were all living in slum housing and earning a maximum of 8,000 taka (\u00a370) despite working long hours of overtime and needing 15,000 taka (\u00a3131) for what they considered a living wage. Anna McMullen, a campaigner at Labour Behind the Label, said she was \u201cdisappointed and angry\u201d that M&amp;S had been not been able to make a difference to the lives of workers, despite its promises. \u201cEverybody was lauding M&amp;S as having achieved something great, but when we checked it out, there hasn\u2019t been an effect,\u201d she said. McMullen called on M&amp;S to be more transparent about its supply chain so that workers\u2019 rights groups could monitor and work with it to improve conditions. M&amp;S said it now knew that the price it paid suppliers was sufficient to ensure that they could pay a living wage in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and that it had also helped factories become more efficient so they could pass on more money to employees. More than 750,000 workers have been trained in financial literacy, workers\u2019 rights and healthcare, giving them more confidence in claiming their due. An M&amp;S spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to further improving working conditions in our clothing supply chain and our work since 2010 has made a significant difference. For example, average wages at our supplier factories in Bangladesh are now 60% above the current minimum wage. \u201cThere\u2019s always more to be done due to the complex nature of the clothing supply chain and we cannot determine the wages paid to supplier employees. However, we are committed to ensuring our cost prices remain high enough to pay a fair living wage, training workers in financial literacy and worker rights, and playing our part in collaborating with other brands and governments to improve the sector.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The taxman and small businesses face losing out on millions of pounds after clothing retailer Blue Inc used a controversial insolvency procedure to close loss-making stores. HMRC could lose \u00a33m and suppliers \u00a331.6m after Blue Inc, which also owns the Officers Club brand, used a pre-pack administration to get rid of 76 stores and cut 500 jobs. The store closures represent roughly a third of Blue Inc\u2019s estate and the retailer, which used to be chaired by former M&amp;S boss Sir Stuart Rose, can now rebuild without its debts. Blue Inc placed the subsidiary that owned and operated the sores\u2019 leases into administration and then immediately bought back the healthiest parts of the business. New documents filed by Leonard Curtis, the administrator, show that Blue Inc paid just \u00a31.2m to buy back 160 stores from the subsidiary, A Levy &amp; Son. The administrator said it had marketed the business to other parties and that was the best offer on the table, although Blue Inc already owned the Blue Inc and Officer Club brands, giving it a major advantage over other contenders. The administrators report shows that A Levy &amp; Son owed millions of pounds to landlords, clothing manufacturers, cleaning companies, and dozens of other small business. Sources close to Blue Inc said suppliers should get back between 50p and 80p in the pound through a deal with the parent company. However, the fate of HMRC\u2019s debt is unclear, with the source saying it represented VAT on Christmas sales that had fallen due after the subsidiary went into administration. The creditors could recoup more of their debts if the admnistrators can raise funds by selling off the remaining assets. However, Leonard Curtis has estimated they would only be able to raise \u00a33m. The pre-pack administration system allows the healthy part of a business that has gone into administration to be sold on quickly, often to its own directors, so it can keep on trading and paying its staff. However, critics have said that the process allows directors to take advantage by selling a business to themselves at a knock-down price and free of debts, leaving creditors \u2013 usually local businesses \u2013 in the lurch. Blue Inc was founded in 1912 and its clothing is targeted at young men. The company tried to float on the stock market in 2014 but later scrapped its plans. The retailer ran into trouble amid tough trading on the high street and racked up almost \u00a39m of losses in the first 10 months of 2015. Unseasonably warm weather in the run-up to Christmas then caused further problems, according to the administrators. Leonard Curtis said: \u201cDespite the company\u2019s substantial growth it faced difficult competitive trading conditions with many competitors in the sector becoming insolvent or restructuring their businesses, leading to rival businesses gaining a competitive advantage over the company. \u201cThe failure of competitors in the company\u2019s sector also made trade insurance more difficult to obtain and resulted in many suppliers reducing or even withdrawing credit terms. This has caused strain on the company\u2019s cash-flow requirements.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "While the distinctive smell of a barbecue may herald the first sign of summer, it is not often associated with energy efficiency. That may be about to change with the launch of a new type of barbecue coal called Hot Coffees, which hails from waste coffee grounds. The bags of coals, expected to go on sale later this year in petrol station forecourts and homeware stores, are just the latest product from Bio-bean, a young London-based company which produces biofuels from coffee grounds. The coals are produced at a 20,000 sq ft production plant in Cambridgeshire that takes in tonnes of waste coffee from the UK\u2019s cafes and factories. The fuels produced are the culmination of an idea by Bio-bean founder Arthur Kay. While studying architecture at university he became interested in circular economies, where resources are kept in use for as long as possible. While working on the design for a coffee shop, he started to focus on where the UK\u2019s 500,000 tonnes a year of waste coffee ended up. In his research he found that oil could be extracted from waste coffee and turned into biodiesel with the leftover grounds turned into biomass pellets for use in boilers. \u201cYou have a resource which is currently under-utilised, and is currently costing companies to get rid of it [through waste disposal],\u201d says Kay, 25. \u201cIt is also a valuable resource. Coffee has a higher calorific value than wood for instance, so there is more energy contained in it than wood.\u201d When every espresso, americano or cappuccino is brewed, hot water passes through the ground beans extracting both the flavour and the caffeine. The leftover grounds are usually thrown out; but in the five-stage system used by Bio-bean, the grounds are refined, agitated and dried out. A biochemical process extracts the oil content, which constitutes about 20% of the weight, while the remainder is dried and made into pellets, briquettes \u2013 and later this year, into barbecue coals. It takes just a few hours after the grounds have been delivered to the factory before they become fuel, says Kay. The pellets are packaged into 1 tonne bags and sold for use in biomass boilers, be they in family homes, airports, offices or supermarkets. A 1 tonne bag is enough to heat a family home for a year, says Kay. Although he refuses to reveal the price he admits they will be cheaper than wood pellets. Some customers supply their waste coffee to Bio-bean and then use the fuel to heat their premises, he adds: \u201cIt creates a closed loop system.\u201d The extracted oil is \u2013 known as second generation or advanced biofuel, because it derives from a waste product: coffee. Such biofuels have been used by McDonald\u2019s \u2013 in its case sourced from cooking oil \u2013 to fuel its delivery trucks. The Bio-bean oil is blended with mineral diesel by fuel companies, says Kay. Along with producing pellets and coals comes the challenge of collecting the grounds. Waste disposal trucks collect the grounds helping the cafe or shop save on disposal costs, he says. The providers range from a small chain of coffee shops to a large producer of coffee. At present the plant is churning through \u201ctens of tonnes a day\u201d but hopes to be processing hundreds of tonnes a day by the end of the year. Kay says his interest is in creating a system which will displace conventional fuels and waste disposal methods. \u201cIt is not about replacing the cup, for example. It is about saying this is a better, cleaner and cheaper cup,\u201d he says. The number of biomass pellets produced in the UK (50,000 tonnes) is far outweighed by the number used (5m tonnes), says Kay. Most are imported from abroad, predominantly from the US. As for the barbecue coals, they are heading to market later this year. Kay says they will reach cooking temperature faster than charcoal, and that they will be cheaper. And the smell? Beyond a faint aroma, there will be no smell of coffee, he pledges. \u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Perpetual progress has been at the heart of western society for the past 150 years or more. The idea has been simple: each generation should be better off than their parents. So it was that the generation that came of age in the early 1950s looked back at the mass unemployment and poverty of the 1930s and thought they were blessed to live in an age of full employment and a cradle-to-grave welfare state. The children of the 1950s generation, leaving school or university in the 1970s, could expect to earn more than their parents, were more likely to own their home, and enjoyed far more personal freedom following the social reforms of the 1960s. The idea that each generation would be more fortunate than the last no longer applies and perhaps helps explain why young people feel that traditional politics has little to offer them. The political economy of the analogue age was based on the idea that people would have secure, full-time employment that would enable them to save the deposit on a home relatively quickly. Two new reports show how that model has completely broken down. The first comes from the Resolution Foundation, which launched an in-depth study of inter-generational fairness with a look at the housing market. The findings are shocking. So-called millennials \u2013 those born between 1982 and 2004 are on average 16 percentage points less likely to own their own than their parents in generation X. They, in turn are 10 percentage points less likely to own a home than their parents in the baby boomer generation. For those on low to middle incomes the situation has become particularly tough. As recently as 1998, more than half of those earning 10-50% of average national income had a mortgage. That figure has now dropped to one in four and will be around one in 10 within a decade on current trends. Owner occupation is increasingly becoming the preserve of the elderly and the well off. It\u2019s not difficult to see why it has become harder for a young person on a modest income to get a foot on the housing ladder: in the late 1990s it took them three years to save up for a deposit, while today it would take 22 years. Soaring house prices have been marvellous for baby boomers, who have often used their windfalls to create their own mini buy-to-let empires, but have been disastrous for generation rent. London has become a virtual no-go area for young people with ambitions to own a home. Rising house prices are, however, not the only reason young people find themselves trapped in rented accommodation. The other factor is that they are struggling to make a decent wage in an increasingly insecure and casualised labour market in which low pay is endemic. That emerges from the first in-depth study into the number of \u201ccrowd workers\u201d, people who are paid for work through online platforms such as Uber, Upwork and Taskrabbit. Prof Ursula Huws of the University of Hertfordshire says that 5 million people are being paid through these online platforms, with more than 3 million of them regularly engaged in various forms of crowd work. Delivery drivers, cleaners, tree surgeons, plumbers are increasingly likely to get jobs this way, with the online platform taking a cut of whatever they earn. Crowd workers tend to be young, according to Huws, who says a third of those aged between 25 and 34 have sought work through online platforms. \u201cA new kind of working life is emerging,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many it is a life in which they do not know from one week, day or even hour to the next when or whether they will have work, so they keep their smartphone always to hand, ready to hit \u2018accept\u2019 at a moment\u2019s notice. They are, in short, permanently logged on.\u201d The sales pitch for crowd working is that it matches people who want a cleaner with someone ready at a minute\u2019s notice to come round with a mop and a vacuum cleaner. It offers freedom, flexibility and greater economic efficiency. What\u2019s not to like? What\u2019s not to like is that the benefits of crowd working are clearly skewed in favour of those who buy in services through online platforms and against those who find work in this way. Crowd working is driving down the cost of labour and is one reason that average earnings growth in the UK is so weak. It forces people, as the Huws research notes, into \u201ca precarious online zero-hours contract existence without benefits such as sick pay, holiday pay, pension contributions or minimum wage guarantees\u201d. There are clearly many policy challenges posed by crowd working: how to ensure that those who own the platforms, often based in the US, pay tax on the work that is being done in the UK; how to ensure that crowd workers enjoy the same labour rights and welfare benefits as those in traditional employment; how to make it possible for freelance workers to band together to form unions. But it is also odds-on that the growth in this sort of labour market will exacerbate inter-generational unfairness, since those doing the hiring from online platforms tend to be older and better off, while those doing the work tend to be younger and poorer. The big unanswered question is whether this sort of economic model is sustainable, because at present it is hard to see how it will be. Here\u2019s the state of play. Young workers joining the labour market often do so with tens of thousands of pounds of student debt, and will struggle to find the sort of permanent well-paid, pensionable job that their parents would have walked into three or four decades ago. They have little prospect of buying a home and if they work in London will be sharing a flat with some mates in one of the less desirable districts of the capital. At the same time, there will be pressure on them to pay more tax. Britain\u2019s pay-as-you go pension system means that payments to retirees come from those people currently in employment, and as the years go by there are going to be more pensioners and fewer workers. The same basic dynamic applies to the NHS, which is already creaking under the strain. Healthcare is more expensive for old, frail people than it is for young fit people, with costs really escalating in the last year of life. Inevitably, the NHS is going to require more resources, and unless the elderly are prepared to shoulder some of the financial cost themselves (which is highly improbable) only one of two things can happen: young people pay more tax or the quality of care will go down. This is a rotten deal for young people, who have every right to be angry. The real surprise is that they are not angrier.",

Delivery drivers, cleaners, tree surgeons, plumbers are increasingly likely to get jobs this way, with the online platform taking a cut of whatever they earn.</p> <p>Crowd workers tend to be young, according to Huws, who says a third of those aged between 25 and 34 have sought work through online platforms. <br></p> <p>\u201cA new kind of working life is emerging,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many it is a life in which they do not know from one week, day or even hour to the next when or whether they will have work, so they keep their smartphone always to hand, ready to hit \u2018accept\u2019 at a moment\u2019s notice. They are, in short, permanently logged on.\u201d</p> <p>The sales pitch for crowd working is that it matches people who want a cleaner with someone ready at a minute\u2019s notice to come round with a mop and a vacuum cleaner. It offers freedom, flexibility and greater economic efficiency. What\u2019s not to like?</p> <p>What\u2019s not to like is that the benefits of crowd working are clearly skewed in favour of those who buy in services through online platforms and against those who find work in this way. Crowd working is driving down the cost of labour and is one reason that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35359689\">average earnings growth in the UK is so weak</a>. It forces people, as the Huws research notes, into \u201ca precarious online zero-hours contract existence without benefits such as sick pay, holiday pay, pension contributions or minimum wage guarantees\u201d.</p> <p>There are clearly many policy challenges posed by crowd working: how to ensure that those who own the platforms, often based in the US, pay tax on the work that is being done in the UK; how to ensure that crowd workers enjoy the same labour rights and welfare benefits as those in traditional employment; how to make it possible for freelance workers to band together to form unions.</p> <p>But it is also odds-on that the growth in this sort of labour market will exacerbate inter-generational unfairness, since those doing the hiring from online platforms tend to be older and better off, while those doing the work tend to be younger and poorer.</p> <p>The big unanswered question is whether this sort of economic model is sustainable, because at present it is hard to see how it will be.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the state of play. Young workers joining the labour market often do so with tens of thousands of pounds of student debt, and will struggle to find the sort of permanent well-paid, pensionable job that their parents would have walked into three or four decades ago. They have little prospect of buying a home and if they work in London will be sharing a flat with some mates in one of the less desirable districts of the capital. At the same time, there will be pressure on them to pay more tax. Britain\u2019s pay-as-you go pension system means that payments to retirees come from those people currently in employment, and as the years go by there are going to be more pensioners and fewer workers.</p> <p>The same basic dynamic applies to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/29/hospitals-told-cut-staff-nhs-cash-crisis\">NHS, which is already creaking under the strain</a>. Healthcare is more expensive for old, frail people than it is for young fit people, with costs really escalating in the last year of life. Inevitably, the NHS is going to require more resources, and unless the elderly are prepared to shoulder some of the financial cost themselves (which is highly improbable) only one of two things can happen: young people pay more tax or the quality of care will go down.</p> <p>This is a rotten deal for young people, who have every right to be angry. The real surprise is that they are not angrier.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A historic industry is plunged into peril as the life is slowly squeezed from it by slowing demand and a flood of cheap imports as the government merely stands by. Sound familiar? It is the grim reality facing British steelmaking. But to anyone with a sense of recent industrial history it is unlikely to come as a surprise; this was also how Britain\u2019s once mighty coal industry was snuffed out during the late 1980s. \u201cKing Coal\u201d was usurped by on one hand a bountiful and cheap supply of North Sea oil and gas, and on the other the sky-high price of British coal compared with much cheaper offerings that poured in from places such as Russia, China and America. Back then, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government sat back, refused calls to slap tariffs on cheap foreign imports and allowed Britain\u2019s coal industry to go under. This time, David Cameron has been accused of failing the UK steel industry after the government confirmed last week that it was blocking proposals from other EU members to tackle the dumping of cut-price subsidised product by China, the world\u2019s biggest producer. The government wants to build up Britain\u2019s trade relations with the People\u2019s Republic. MPs were told the European commission wanted to increase the tariffs on Chinese imports to help the struggling steel industry. But the government opposed increasing the tariffs to the same punitive rate as the United States \u2013 where 256% was imposed last year, with the commerce department calling for more. The EU has only increased the import duty on Chinese goods to between 9.2% and 13%. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said it would not be right for the EU to scrap regulations, known as the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d, which some countries want to end in order to allow higher tariffs on Chinese steel. With pressure building on European policymakers to take a stand against China, around 5,000 steelworkers will join a huge demonstration in Brussels on Monday. They will be joined by executives including Karl K\u00f6hler, boss of Tata Steel Europe, which owns the rump of British Steel. They want the EU to take action on the waves of cheap Chinese steel that threaten to wipe out western producers. Britain\u2019s steel industry is in the frontline of this fight for survival, after shedding 5,000 jobs since last summer. K\u00f6hler has warned that the situation facing the industry is \u201cperilous\u201d and has urged Brussels to take \u201cimmediate and robust action\u201d against China or thousands more jobs across the sector will be threatened. The wave of exported steel from China over the past 18 months comes as its own domestic economic growth has slowed. Beijing wants to grab whatever foreign cash it can on global markets by selling its products at a knockdown rate. Chinese steel imports to the EU have risen from 4.5m tonnes in 2014 to a projected figure of 7m tonnes for last year. This glut has almost halved the price of hot rolled coil in northern Europe \u2013 an industry benchmark product \u2013 from \u20ac600 (\u00a3415) per tonne last summer to about \u20ac350 per tonne. As a result, it has become increasingly uneconomic to make steel in Britain. Tata has closed sites and is selling its Scunthorpe plant; meanwhile, its biggest UK plant, in Port Talbot, south Wales, is losing about \u00a31m a day and sources reckon it requires \u00a3500m of investment to make it viable. Tata needs a helping hand if it is to continue as the main custodian for Britain\u2019s steel industry. The group received a small boost last week from the Indian government, which has shown the European Union the way by slapping minimum tariffs on steel imports from China and South Korea. The move will provide a level playing field for Tata Steel in India. It is precisely the sort of respite that K\u00f6hler and the other marchers will be crying out for in Brussels. Failure could consign British steel to the history books: buried alongside King Coal. Yellen didn\u2019t say much, but markets don\u2019t listen well anyway Janet Yellen\u2019s performance in front of the US Congress last week was never going to be a re-run of the performances given by her predecessor-but-one, Alan Greenspan, in the 1990s. For one thing, the US Federal Reserve boss is not predisposed to grand gestures. She is also well aware that pumping stock markets with cheap credit has a habit of generating toxic bubbles. Greenspan enjoyed references to his genius and liked solving problems of insolvency with low interest rates \u2013 making a special contribution to markets crashing in 2008. Yellen was the focus of attention on Capitol Hill following the rout in stock markets that has sent shares tumbling from Tokyo to London. Some senators wanted to blame the Fed, since it raised interest rates in December amid a broad slowdown in manufacturing output. They said forcing businesses to cope with higher borrowing costs while Europe\u2019s and China\u2019s factory sectors were under stress was asking for trouble. They wanted her to admit that without a strong manufacturing backbone, and the absence of inflation, further rate rises were out of the question. On the other side of the fence were senators hoping she would point to the strength of consumer demand since 2009, signalling the death of the Greenspan Doctrine and smoothing the way for a couple more rate hikes before the end of the year. She did neither, leaving traders in limbo. Maybe this is a good move, since trying to appease volatile markets, which are in part driven by computer algorithms, is like whispering instructions to a shoal of fish. Yet the Fed\u2019s direction of travel is almost predetermined after the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank indicated that, to boost sluggish growth, they will be cutting interest rates and injecting further funds into their economies. If you can\u2019t beat them, join them. Unfortunately this will perpetuate the myth that loosening central bank purse strings is the answer, when that acts less like a bazooka and more like a popgun. Government spending, particularly on infrastructure, has the power to lead to sustainable growth. We want the facts about the pay gap, and we want them now Five companies voluntarily publish their gender pay gap: Tesco, Friends Life, PricewaterhouseCoopers, AstraZeneca and Genesis Housing. This can only lead to the conclusion that every other company has something to hide. It is totally unacceptable that a woman on average earns around 80p for every pound earned by a man. So efforts by the Conservative government to force companies which employ more than 250 people to publish how much they pay male and female staff are to be welcomed. The only shame is that this requirement is being delayed until 2018. Companies should do the right thing now \u2013 particularly for their female employees \u2013 and start to follow the example of the five that are already reporting their pay gap. They should start to publish their data before the 2018 deadline \u2013 and, crucially, all companies should be required to set out a plan about how they intend to ensure that the disparity ends.",

It is precisely the sort of respite that K\u00f6hler and the other marchers will be crying out for in Brussels.</p> <p>Failure could consign British steel to the history books: buried alongside King Coal.</p> <h2>Yellen didn\u2019t say much, but markets don\u2019t listen well anyway</h2> <p>Janet Yellen\u2019s performance in front of the US Congress last week was never going to be a re-run of the performances given by her predecessor-but-one, Alan Greenspan, in the 1990s.</p> <p>For one thing, the US Federal Reserve boss is not predisposed to grand gestures. She is also well aware that pumping stock markets with cheap credit has a habit of generating toxic bubbles. Greenspan enjoyed references to his genius and liked solving problems of insolvency with low interest rates \u2013 making a special contribution to markets crashing in 2008.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/09/interest-rates-markets-janet-yellen-briefs-congress\" title=\"\">Yellen was the focus of attention on Capitol Hill</a> following the rout in stock markets that has sent shares tumbling from Tokyo to London. Some senators wanted to blame the Fed, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jan/15/janet-yellen-federal-reserve-interest-rate-blunder\" title=\"\">since it raised interest rates in December</a> amid a broad slowdown in manufacturing output. They said forcing businesses to cope with higher borrowing costs while Europe\u2019s and China\u2019s factory sectors were under stress was asking for trouble. They wanted her to admit that without a strong manufacturing backbone, and the absence of inflation, further rate rises were out of the question.</p> <p>On the other side of the fence were senators hoping she would point to the strength of consumer demand since 2009, signalling the death of the Greenspan Doctrine and smoothing the way for a couple more rate hikes before the end of the year. She did neither, leaving traders in limbo. Maybe this is a good move, since trying to appease volatile markets, which are in part driven by computer algorithms, is like whispering instructions to a shoal of fish.</p> <p>Yet the Fed\u2019s direction of travel is almost predetermined after <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-boj-decision-idUSKCN0V70A7\" title=\"\">the Bank of Japan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/mario-draghi-ecb-prepared-to-cut-interest-rates-and-expand-qe\" title=\"\">European Central Bank</a> indicated that, to boost sluggish growth, they will be cutting interest rates and injecting further funds into their economies.</p> <p>If you can\u2019t beat them, join them. Unfortunately this will perpetuate the myth that loosening central bank purse strings is the answer, when that acts less like a bazooka and more like a popgun. Government spending, particularly on infrastructure, has the power to lead to sustainable growth.</p> <h2>We want the facts about the pay gap, and we want them now</h2> <p>Five companies voluntarily publish their gender pay gap: Tesco, Friends Life, PricewaterhouseCoopers, AstraZeneca and Genesis Housing. This can only lead to the conclusion that every other company has something to hide.</p> <p>It is totally unacceptable that a woman on average earns around 80p for every pound earned by a man. So efforts by the Conservative government to force companies which employ more than 250 people to publish how much they pay male and female staff are to be welcomed. The only shame is that this requirement is being delayed until 2018.</p> <p>Companies should do the right thing now \u2013 particularly for their female employees \u2013 and start to follow the example of the five that are already reporting their pay gap. They should start to publish their data before the 2018 deadline \u2013 and, crucially, all companies should be required to set out a plan about how they intend to ensure that the disparity ends.</p>",
