That's where the questions need to go today.\" Cameron would like to see some kind of banking union in the eurozone and the emergence of a system of transfer of resources within the euro area, possibly through euro bonds. His aides say they expect further pressure to be put on Angela Merkel at the G20 summit, just as it was put on the German chancellor at the G8 summit in Washington last month. British officials stressed it had to be \"constructive pressure\". Cameron is acutely aware that Merkel wants expectations lowered and that too many European politicians do the opposite at summits, leading to subsequent disappointment in the markets. Barack Obama was meeting Merkel at the G20 summit separately, to seek an update on German thinking. The US president is also due to meet the key eurozone players \u2013 France, Germany, Italy and Spain. This quartet will meet in Italy on Friday ahead of a European council meeting next week.",

The Greek relief rally lasted an hour on Monday. Worse, Spain's borrowing costs hit another euro-era high \u2013 the yield on 10-year bonds reached 7.2%. The Spanish banking bailout, announced amid triumphalism in Madrid only nine days ago, seems like another age. There were at least three problems with it. First, it destroyed the notion that Spain's saving grace was its relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio: the \u20ac100bn, or whatever the final figure turns out to be, goes directly onto the government's books since the bailout is not, as Rajoy had wished, a direct injection of funds into the Spanish banking system. Second, investors in Spanish bonds feared being relegated down the pecking order of creditors if the loans directed via Madrid to the banks carry preferred status. Third, investors made the straightforward calculation that a country that cannot raise money at attractive rates to fund its banks cannot raise affordable capital full stop. At 7.2%, the cat is out of the bag. Spain can tolerate such rates for a while (there will be an auction of short-dated debt on Tuesday and another later in the week) but the only sure-fire remedy is a direct sovereign bailout. That's the reality the eurozone leaders may have to confront in Brussels at the end of this month. To take Spain out of the bond market for three years might cost \u20ac400bn or so (since there's about \u20ac200bn of debt that matures in that period), which is roughly the level of eurozone members' commitments to the European Stability Mechanism. But there's a world of difference between a commitment to write a cheque and the act of writing it. Indeed, deploying the ESM would almost exhaust the fund that was meant to stand as a deterrent against market attacks. In other words, the markets are calling the politicians' bluff.

      "bodyText": "Premier and Football League clubs will no longer carry advertising for the high-cost lender Wonga on their websites. The move follows a campaign by football fans, led by Northampton Town supporter Bob Ward, calling on clubs to stop carrying ads for the lender, which charges 4,214% APR for short-term online loans. More than 80 sides use a website platform carrying advertising negotiated by the league through an internet subsidiary: last season this advertising included promotion of Wonga's loans. But a league spokesman said: \"The Football League's website advertising agreement with Wonga.com concluded at the end of the 2011/12 football season. It is not currently envisaged that this agreement will be extended.\" He said the short-term deal had run from December 2011. Wonga is the highest profile of about 200 payday loans firms which are the subject of an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading. High cost \u2013 or payday \u2013 lenders have attracted criticism from MPs and consumer groups for targeting low-income customers who often end up rolling over their borrowing and accruing huge charges. In March supporters from 18 different clubs wrote an open letter to the Guardian, calling on their sides to stop carrying Wonga advertising. Ward and Scunthorpe United supporter John Flanagan also tabled a motion to be debated at the Football Supporters Federation AGM in July 2012, asking the League and the FLi not to renew the website contract with Wonga until the payday loans industry was subject to strict controls and a cap on interest rates. Labour MP Stella Creasy, a fierce campaigner against high cost lenders which she describes as \"legal loan sharks\", called for people to join the FSF so they could vote at the AGM and \"show Wonga the red card\". Ward welcomed the announcement, saying: \"Some 12% of the FLi [Football League interactive] website's demographic is under 18 \u2013 that means one person in eight being exposed to these revolting adverts is not even an adult. The Football League and Wonga may say this is strictly a business decision but I can't help thinking that in some small way the campaign is responsible for this.\" A spokesperson for Wonga said: \"We had a small advertising deal with the Football League which ended at the end of the 2011/2012 football season. We will continue to assess all opportunities and sponsorship deals for next season.\" It is understood that Wonga was disappointed with the new business generated by the FLi website advertising. Credit card provider Capital One, which recently announced its sponsorship of the League Cup, is expected to start advertising through the FLi website platform in July, although the Football League and Capital One refused to confirm this. It is not the first time one of Wonga's advertising deals has ended following criticism. In January 2011 Transport for London excluded Wonga and other high cost lenders from its sponsorship deals following bad publicity of Wonga's sponsorship of free travel on New Year's Eve 2010. Wonga is a prolific advertiser on TV, radio and the sides of London buses: it also sponsors two football clubs Blackpool and Heart of Midlothian and says it is committed to continuing these relationships. This means it is unlikely to be the last that Wonga hears of Ward and his fellow supporters. \"There is still a payday lender involvement with football clubs so the campaign still has legs,\" he said. \u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 19 June 2011. The original said Wonga adverts had been dropped by the Football League, when both sides agree that a short-term deal had come to an end.",

A fraud and corruption investigation into one of Europe's largest banking failures is a huge undertaking. Arguably not since BCCI had the SFO taken on something so dizzying in scale and complexity. And the activities of banks have certainly not got simpler since 1991, when BCCI failed. If only the government had delivered on their coalition agreement pledge to \"take white collar crime as seriously as other crime\", merging, as promised, parts of the FSA, OFT and SFO into an Economic Crime Agency. That pledge was abandoned after interminable squabbling over departmental funding and budgets. On reflection, it looks an opportunity sorely missed.",

Not at WPP, where one Koichiro Naganuma, a non-executive director since 2004, usually fails to show. As Reuters pointed out last week, the fact that Naganuma has managed to attend only three of 13 board meetings in the past two years was probably the reason why 30% of voting shareholders opposed his re-election to the WPP boardroom last week. That sub-plot was largely overlooked amid the kerfuffle over chief executive Sir Martin's Sorrell's giant pay package. Naganuma's record of attendance over six years is even more astonishing. He was a no-show at 39 out of 46 meetings stretching back to 2006, according to the annual reports. Even in 2008, when WPP's board was working overtime amid the global banking crisis and met 15 times, Naganuma attended only once. WPP's explanation \u2013 strange as it sounds \u2013 is that Naganuma is doing everything expected of him. He owes his seat on the board to a joint venture and cross-shareholding agreement between WPP and Japanese advertising agency Asatsu-DK that dates back to 1998. Apparently, there never was any requirement that a directorship should actually entail the vulgar business of attending board meetings \u2013 once a year, on the eve of the annual meeting, would do fine. The arrangement might (just about) be understandable if the fates of WPP and Asatsu were entwined. A case could, perhaps, have been made in 1998 but not now: Asatsu's stake in WPP has been diluted down from 4% to 2.5% and WPP's 24% holding in Asatsu is but a distant twinkle in the firm's greater galaxy. If a seat in WPP's boardroom can mean so little, it's no wonder some shareholders feel there's a governance vacuum.",

He owes his seat on the board to a joint venture and cross-shareholding agreement between WPP and Japanese advertising agency Asatsu-DK that dates back to 1998. Apparently, there never was any requirement that a directorship should actually entail the vulgar business of attending board meetings \u2013 once a year, on the eve of the annual meeting, would do fine.</p> <p>The arrangement might (just about) be understandable if the fates of WPP and Asatsu were entwined. A case could, perhaps, have been made in 1998 but not now: Asatsu's stake in WPP has been diluted down from 4% to 2.5% and WPP's 24% holding in Asatsu is but a distant twinkle in the firm's greater galaxy. If a seat in WPP's boardroom can mean so little, it's no wonder some shareholders feel there's a governance vacuum.</p>",

In fact, bank paperwork showed these senior lenders had been fully declared.</p> <p>Dawn searches of Vincent Tchenguiz's home and Park Lane offices were part of a co-ordinated series of raids in London and Reykjavik in March last year, targeting a handful of senior former Kaupthing bankers, the two brothers and their chief lieutenants. No charges have been brought and all deny wrongdoing.</p> <p>The Tchenguiz brothers have themselves claimed to be among the biggest victims of Kaupthing's collapse in 2008, filing civil claims accusing the bank's former executives of \"fraudulent misrepresentation\". These claims have since been dropped.</p> <p>The 2008 collapse of Kaupthing and its subsidiaries \u2013 including the British bank KSF, which had attracted billions of pounds in online deposits from British savers through its Kaupthing Edge account \u2013 have led to a string of civil and criminal allegations of fraud around the world. No one has yet been prosecuted.</p> <p>Aggravating the impact of the bungled warrant application, Alderman used SFO powers in effect to prevent the return of documents wrongfully taken from Tchenguiz in raids in March last year, ensuring they were kept under lock and key at a firm of lawyers.</p> <p>However, Alderman's successor Green quickly promised the documents would be returned and pledged to conduct a rapid review of the merits of continuing a fraud investigation into Vincent Tchenguiz. It is this review that led him to write to the property tycoon and inform him he was no longer a suspect in the SFO's inquiries.</p> <p>In an unusual step, this review was made public last month during a judicial review of the SFO's actions brought by the brothers. The judgment is still awaited.</p> <p>During the hearing, Vincent Tchenguiz's lawyers accused the SFO of clinging to suspicions about the property entrepreneur \"like Mr Micawber, in the hope that something will turn up\".</p>",

Dawn searches of Vincent Tchenguiz's home and Park Lane offices were part of a co-ordinated series of raids in London and Reykjavik in March last year, targeting a handful of senior former Kaupthing bankers, the two brothers and their chief lieutenants. No charges have been brought and all deny wrongdoing. The Tchenguiz brothers have themselves claimed to be among the biggest victims of Kaupthing's collapse in 2008, filing civil claims accusing the bank's former executives of \"fraudulent misrepresentation\". These claims have since been dropped. The 2008 collapse of Kaupthing and its subsidiaries \u2013 including the British bank KSF, which had attracted billions of pounds in online deposits from British savers through its Kaupthing Edge account \u2013 have led to a string of civil and criminal allegations of fraud around the world. No one has yet been prosecuted. Aggravating the impact of the bungled warrant application, Alderman used SFO powers in effect to prevent the return of documents wrongfully taken from Tchenguiz in raids in March last year, ensuring they were kept under lock and key at a firm of lawyers. However, Alderman's successor Green quickly promised the documents would be returned and pledged to conduct a rapid review of the merits of continuing a fraud investigation into Vincent Tchenguiz. It is this review that led him to write to the property tycoon and inform him he was no longer a suspect in the SFO's inquiries. In an unusual step, this review was made public last month during a judicial review of the SFO's actions brought by the brothers. The judgment is still awaited. During the hearing, Vincent Tchenguiz's lawyers accused the SFO of clinging to suspicions about the property entrepreneur \"like Mr Micawber, in the hope that something will turn up\".",

      "bodyText": "To understand all the fuss about a potential Greek exit from the eurozone, think about the impact that it would have the banking system alone. Some \u20ac44bn (\u00a335bn) of bank deposits have been already withdrawn from the country's banks between April 2011 and 2012 and the fear was that this trend would accelerate after Sunday's elections. The outcome of the elections - and the chance that the pro-bailout, pro-European New Democracy party will be able to form a government - may have taken the pressure off bank deposits for now. Speculation about a Greece exit from the eurozone - which would cut the value of deposits inside bank accounts as the currency devalues - is fading for now. But this chart, produced by Royal Bank of Scotland analysts, shows just how serious the situation has already become. It also explains why there is talk of a need for a pan-European banking system. While deposits of \u20ac100,000 are guaranteed across the eurozone it is the banking systems within each country (and ultimately the sovereign) that maintains the guarantee. So, if there are concerns about the strength of banks in one country in the eurozone it is relatively easy for a customer to move their money to a bank in another country that they consider to be stronger than their own. If deposits were guaranteed centrally, the urge to move money should disappear and is one of the reasons why there are now talks about the need for a pan-European banking system to stabilise the eurozone. But our correspondent in Brussels notes, this is some way off from being agreed - and means that the data on outflows from banking systems around the eurozone will continue to be scrutinised.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mobile phone giant Vodafone has claimed victory in its \u00a31bn bid for Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide following the capitulation of CWW's largest shareholder. Vodafone's ambitions of creating the second largest telecoms group in the UK after BT had been cast into doubt by Orbis Investment Management, which holds a 19% stake in CWW and had threatened to block the deal in the hope of securing a higher price. The offer required approval from 75% of votes cast, meaning a low turnout or a few more objectors could have tipped the scales in favour of Orbis. However, proxy votes received on Friday from those who could not attend the emergency meeting had been overwhelmingly in favour, with nearly 99% in support, and the votes represented nearly 60% of all CWW shares. \"Based on the information announced by CWW today which was shared with us on Saturday and following discussions with CWW, we now believe that the CWW Scheme of Arrangement will eventually succeed, even if Orbis were to vote against it today,\" the investment fund stated. \"In these circumstances our opposition would only serve to prolong the process because the company would likely adjourn today's meetings to secure the necessary votes. This is not in the interests of any CWW stakeholder. Accordingly, Orbis intends to vote in favour of the scheme at the meetings today.\" Vodafone is paying 38p a share, 2% less than the company's average price over the past 12 months, and Orbis had complained the deal did not \"reflect the value\" of CWW. However, the cable network has suffered a share price collapse following a series of profit warnings. Its previous management under chairman John Pluthero struggled to digest a series of acquisitions and compete for corporate clients with BT. This was despite securing one of the largest incentive deals on record for a listed company, which saw top executives from CWW and its sister company Cable &amp; Wireless Communications collect \u00a388m in payouts. CWC, which operates telecoms companies in the Caribbean and Panama, was spun out and listed as a separate company in March 2010, and will remain independent following the Vodafone deal. The only alternative to Vodafone's offer open to investors was to back new chief executive Gavin Darby's recovery plan. But Darby, who worked at Vodafone before joining CWW, was regarded by many investors as having been hired to sell the company rather than turn it around, and the company's own board recommend the Vodafone bid as providing more certainty amid tough market conditions. Vodafone's interest sparked Tata Communications to make an offer, but the Indian group withdrew after failing to reach agreement with CWW's board on an offer price, leaving Vodafone as sole bidder. The acquisition will transform Vodafone's UK arm into the second largest domestic telecoms business after BT, with revenues of just under \u00a37bn. It brings to an end the story of one of Britain's oldest telecoms businesses. CWW traces its beginnings to a series of telegraph companies founded in the 1860s, and grew up to become the empire's communications network. The merger will allow Vodafone to overtake rival mobile networks Everything Everywhere and O2 in income in the UK, and to take on BT and Virgin Media in offering telecoms and data hosting solutions to the business sector. CWW's fibre-optic cables, one of the largest British owned networks with 20,500km of lines, will also give Vodafone the capacity to carry more mobile internet traffic at a lower cost. It currently rents a large amount of capacity from BT.",
