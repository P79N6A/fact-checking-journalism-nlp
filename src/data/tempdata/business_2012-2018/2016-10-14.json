      "bodyText": "Scrapping bonuses and capping directors\u2019 pay are among a number of ideas being considered by a powerful City investor in an attempt to curb executive remuneration. Fund manager Hermes Investment Management is drawing up a paper on overhauling boardroom pay, which could include a number of options such as the abolition of bonuses, or the simplification of pay to reduce the size of bonuses and increasing salaries. The proposals could cut the average pay for an FTSE 100 chief executive from \u00a35m, including bonuses, to about \u00a33m. Hermes is also preparing to propose ideas that would in effect put a limit on pay deals by requiring companies to set out the maximum amount that the chief executive could receive each year. It would also require executives to keep a shareholding in the company even after they had left. Many boardroom executives have three components to their pay: salaries, annual bonuses and a three-year bonus plan paid in shares. A debate about revising this format has been raging for some time. But it has been pushed to the top of the agenda after Theresa May pledged to reform the capitalist system during her campaign to become prime minister. She has discussed giving shareholders a new binding vote on pay and putting workers on boards. Hans-Christoph Hirt, co-head of the stewardship team at Hermes, acknowledged that getting rid of bonuses entirely was unlikely to gain immediate support and said one idea could \u201cbe the partial abolishment of bonuses and other variable pay, and moving towards increased fixed pay\u201d. Fund managers usually step back from being prescriptive about the total size of a pay package, but Hirt said companies should set out a maximum. \u201cThe objective is to have an agreement about what the maximum would be even when the company is performing very well,\u201d he said. One of the high-profile rows over pay during this year\u2019s annual general meeting season took place at the advertiser WPP when a third of investors opposed a \u00a370m pay deal handed to its chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell. The size of the deal was higher than had been expected because of an increase in the value of the shares he had been awarded in previous years. Another fund manager has also been setting out its ambitions to reform executive pay. Legal &amp; General Investment Management has called for a cap on directors\u2019 bonuses, so they are no bigger than two times salary, and also for companies to publish the pay ratio between their chief executive and their median employee. Some companies have already abolished bonuses. Neil Woodford, a respected City fund manager, has put all staff at his Oxford-based Woodford Investment Management on a flat salary this year. He gave them a pay rise for the current financial year. In July a group of City grandees, which met under the auspices of the lobby group the Investment Association, also published ideas to reform pay.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will not take instructions on its policies from politicians, its governor, Mark Carney, has said, just a week after Theresa May took a swipe at the impact of the Bank\u2019s actions on \u201cordinary\u201d people. Speaking at Birmingham town hall as part of the Bank\u2019s Future Forum event on Friday, Carney said it became difficult for the Bank when politicians commented on its policies rather than its objectives. He said politicians had done a \u201cgood job\u201d of setting up the system in which the Bank operates, but added: \u201cWe are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side.\u201d May hit out at the Bank during the Tory party conference last week. She said it was the rich who benefited from the Bank printing money and cutting interest rates in the years after the 2008 financial crash, while \u201cordinary, working class people\u201d were asked to make sacrifices in terms of stagnating pay, job insecurity and unaffordable housing. The Bank took the decision in August to cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% and fire up the printing presses for more quantitative easing in a bid to ward off recession following the Brexit vote. At Friday\u2019s meeting in Birmingham, Carney hinted that the Bank will let inflation overshoot its target \u2013 meaning rising prices for households \u2013 by keeping interest rates low. With the weak pound pushing up import costs, Carney said people should expect an impact on living standards as higher costs are passed on. This week the effect on import costs sparked a row over the price of Marmite between its makers Unilever and supermarket Tesco. Speaking as the pound came under further pressure against other currencies on worries over the UK\u2019s economic outlook, Carney also said the central bank was \u201cnot indifferent\u201d to the level of sterling, but did not target the exchange rate. His comments underscore the balancing act the Bank will face over the coming months as the pound\u2019s fall and low interest rates push up inflation while uncertainty brought by the Brexit vote threatens to knock economic growth and employment. The Bank cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% in August and has signalled it could cut again to around 0.1% by the end of this year. Speaking during a day of events across the Midlands to explain the Bank\u2019s role and to canvas views from the public, Carney said that for those on the lowest incomes, \u201cit is going to get more difficult as we move from no inflation to some inflation\u201d. The Bank has been set a target of inflation at 2% by the government, but the rate is widely expected to exceed that during the next two years, as it rises sharply from a relatively low 0.6% in August, the latest available official figure. Carney used an event in Birmingham to explain that the Bank\u2019s policymakers had living standards in mind when they cut borrowing costs in August. Without that action to shore up post-referendum confidence, the toll on jobs would have been much higher, the governor said. \u201cWe took a decision that it was better not to have another 400,000 or 500,000 people unemployed in order to get inflation right back to target at exactly two years. That was a trade-off that we took,\u201d he said. He acknowledged that the Bank\u2019s main objective was the 2% inflation target, but that it had some flexibility over the time it hit the target. Earlier in the day, he said the Bank was willing to allow inflation to run \u201ca bit\u201d higher than its target to help employment and allow the economy to grow. But later, in comments broadcast by the BBC, Carney said the economy had performed a little better than the Bank had anticipated and that the Bank would also be weighing price pressures when its monetary policy committee met in November to set rates. \u201cThe economy is performing a little better than expected, albeit it is slow relative to the rate it had prior to the referendum,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe have to take into account inflation considerations, so we\u2019ll take that into account.\u201d Separately, MPC member Kristin Forbes said inflation could sharply overshoot its target after the Bank\u2019s rate cut and expansion to its electronic money printing programme, known as quantitative easing. \u201cAll in all, partly due to this package, partly due to the underlying momentum in the economy, partly due to other changes in the economy, it does look like the days of inflation bouncing around zero are long gone,\u201d Forbes told a conference in Poland, according to news service Reuters. \u201cInflation is already picking up. It will pick up even faster and we are likely to overshoot our 2% inflation target, perhaps sharply in the next two years.\u201d Their comments came as growing worries over rising inflation in the UK prompted investors to offload UK government bonds. That pushed yields on 10-year government bonds, which move inversely to prices, to their highest levels since the referendum in June. Those moves further strained nerves on financial markets after a tumultuous fortnight for the pound. The UK currency recently hit fresh 31-year lows against the dollar, hurt by worries over a potential hard Brexit deal that erodes the UK\u2019s economic standing. On Friday, the pound was below $1.22, and was also lower against the euro, at just below \u20ac1.11. On the night of the referendum, \u00a31 was worth $1.49 and \u20ac1.31 respectively. Speaking about the pound in Birmingham, Carney said: \u201cWe don\u2019t target the exchange rate \u2026 But the exchange rate does matter for inflation. Changes in the exchange rate do have an impact on inflation over a period of time. \u201cSo we are not indifferent to the level. We are not going to target the level. We are not going to have some magic number for it. But it does factor into our thinking as we are striking that right balance in a period of adjustment.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prawn sandwich brigade lambasted by Roy Keane is set to suffer another blow after the price paid by UK importers for prawns reached a record high. The increase of 15% in the past three months, reported by UK purchasing company Beacon, is because of a number of factors, including rising demand, droughts in Bangladesh and Vietnam, and poor harvests in China, which have left European importers\u2019 prawn stocks running low. The average price paid by UK seafood suppliers for king and tiger prawns has risen to \u00a312.75 a kilogram, while the average price for northern Atlantic prawns has hit \u00a311.72. Beacon warned that the price rises would be passed on to consumers. Prawn prices are set to remain high into next year. Beacon\u2019s main seafood suppliers, M&amp;J Seafood and Direct Seafoods, are reporting price increases in Vietnam, where production has fallen sharply following a severe drought in the Mekong delta in the spring, the worst in nearly a century. Low harvests in China have caused local demand for prawns to surge, reducing exports to Europe. In Canada, there has been a 42% cut in the coldwater prawn quota, equivalent to a reduction of more than 20,000 tonnes. Farmers are switching from black tiger prawns to the vannamei species, with the former 40% more expensive than their lower cost alternatives. But the rise in demand for vannamei is likely to push prices up further. Emma Warrington, a senior food buyer at Beacon, said: \u201cAt the moment, suppliers are doing everything in their power to mitigate price increases for the end consumer. \u201cHowever, with the pressure likely to continue into next year, it\u2019s only a matter of time before these price increases are passed on, meaning the classic Christmas prawn cocktail could be more expensive this year.\u201d Richard Watson, a market analyst at industry group Seafish, said: \u201cShrimp traders are already building stocks for the festive period. The main producing nations report reduced supply, hence prices are on the rise. For example, Ecuadorian production has dropped since last month, pushing prices up.\u201d The global prawn industry, which produces more than 6m tonnes a year, has been mired in controversy over its ecological impact and link to slavery.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of women who work in Asda stores have won the right to lodge the UK\u2019s largest private sector equal pay claim. An employment tribunal ruled that the women, who work in roles across the shopfloor, can compare their jobs with those done for a higher wage in Asda\u2019s warehouses, predominantly by men. If the women win, the retailer could be forced to adjust the pay of many of its 130,000 shopfloor staff, and make back payments to those involved in the case going back to 2002, at an estimated cost of up to \u00a3100m. Lawyers representing the shopfloor workers said the women typically earned between \u00a31 and \u00a33 an hour less than staff at Asda\u2019s distribution centres. The shopfloor workers say they are doing jobs of equal value, but are paid less because their work was historically perceived as \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d and therefore thought to be worth less than men\u2019s work. They claim that this historical discrimination has never been corrected by the firm. The Walmart-owned retailer argued the roles could not be compared because they were carried out in different locations. However, the judgment, which followed a Manchester employment tribunal hearing in June, deemed that this was not the case, paving the way for an equal pay case in which judges will examine the value of the jobs being done. About 9,500 past and current Asda workers from across the UK have signed up with the law firm Leigh Day, which will represent them in the pay claim next year. Lauren Lougheed, a lawyer at Leigh Day, said: \u201cThis is a dramatic victory for the workers we represent. Asda tried to argue that because the shops and distribution centres were in different locations, with different pay arrangements, that Asda could pay the men what they like. \u201cHowever, the employment tribunal found that Asda, the employer of both men and women, could have made sure that there was equal pay between men and women if they wanted to, but chose not to.\u201d In a statement, Asda disputed the claims being made against it. \u201cWe believe the demands of the jobs are very different and are considering our options for appeal,\u201d the supermarket said. \u201cAt Asda, hourly paid colleagues doing the same job in the same location are paid the same. Men and women doing the same job in our retail stores are paid the same. Men and women doing the same job in our distribution centres are paid the same. Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors.\u201d Asda stressed that the decision by the tribunal was on a preliminary issue. \u201cThe tribunal has yet to consider whether the jobs are of equal value in terms of their demands and, if some jobs are, only then will the tribunal move on to consider the reasons for the differentials, including the existence of different market rates in different industry sectors,\u201d it said. At the hearing in June, Asda argued that its distribution and retail sectors were \u201cfundamentally different\u201d and that they operated in different environments and required different skillsets. The judge heard witness statements from five workers with different roles on the shopfloor, including a personal shopper from the Brighton Marina store and a former checkout operator in Wirral. Lougheed said the judgment would have implications for other supermarket equal pay claims, including those Leigh Day is bringing on behalf of about 400 Sainsbury\u2019s workers. Chris Cook, the head of the employment department at legal firm SA Law, said the decision was a major milestone but only the first step in a long process. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an isolated case by any means,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll no doubt see major retailers up and down the country facing similar claims around the disparity between the wages of their distribution staff and employees working away on the shopfloor. Even more crucially, employees in any number of sectors will be taking a closer look at their pay packets and how they compare to their colleagues across a business.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Wells Fargo profits dropped by 2.6% as earnings slipped in the third quarter, the bank said on Friday, days after its chief executive and chairman, John Stumpf, announced his retirement in the wake of a scandal over sales practices. In early September, Wells Fargo reached a $185m settlement with regulators following allegations that employees opened up to 2m bank and credit card accounts without customers\u2019 authorization, in order to meet sales goals. In the quarter ending on 30 September, the bank said, it earned $5.6bn or $1.03 per share, compared with $5.8bn or $1.05 per share in the same period a year earlier. The results beat analysts\u2019 expectations, of $1.01 per share. Under pressure from politicians and investors, Stumpf retired on Wednesday. \u201cJohn will not receive any severance payment. His retirement benefits are disclosed in our proxy statement,\u201d a spokeswoman told the Guardian. Stumpf could however leave with as much as $130m, according to CNN Money analysis. Stumpf owns 2.4m shares of stock, worth $107m. \u201cIf Wells Fargo\u2019s John Stumpf is leaving with all of his ill-gotten millions, that\u2019s still not real accountability,\u201d Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted after Stumpf announced his retirement. Warren, a leading voice for accountability and reform in the financial sector, previously called on Stumpf to resign, return \u201cevery nickel he made during the scam\u201d and submit to inquiry from Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Department of Justice. \u201cA bank teller would face criminal charges and a prison sentence for stealing a handful of twenties from the cash drawer,\u201d she said. Stumpf has forfeited stock awards worth $41m; had he stayed on, he was to forgo any salary while an independent investigation into sales practices was ongoing. Carrie Tolstedt, who oversaw the retail banking business when the unauthorized accounts were created, retired earlier this year. According to Wells Fargo, Tolstedt will not receive severance and has waived about $19m in unvested stocks. However, she is still to walk away with about $77m. In mid-September, the bank told US lawmakers Tolstedt owned 960,017 shares, then worth about $43.6m, and $34.1m worth of vested stock options. Chief operating officer Tim Sloan was named to replace Stumpf as chief executive. In a statement, he said: \u201cI am deeply committed to restoring the trust of all of our stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders, and community partners. \u201cWe know that it will take time and a lot of hard work to earn back our reputation, but I am confident because of the incredible caliber of our team members. We will work tirelessly to build a stronger and better Wells Fargo for generations to come.\u201d Asked in a call with investors on Friday if Wells Fargo should consider bringing in someone new to lead the bank, Sloan said that was \u201ca fair question\u201d but said the board was \u201ccomfortable with and supportive of\u201d the current management team. Sloan also said it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d to hear claims of retaliation against staff members who tried to flag the practice of opening unauthorized accounts. Wells Fargo, he said, had reached out to staff members who were let go for not meeting their sales quotas and might be eligible for rehire. As of 1 October, the bank has eliminated sales quotas in its retail banking business. Employees are the bank\u2019s \u201cmost important asset\u201d, Sloan said. From 2011, more than 5,300 such employees were fired for creating unauthorized accounts. Stumpf said those firings were not part of an \u201corchestrated effort\u201d. Matt Moscardi, head of financial sector research at MSCI, said scapegoating former employees and firing those who did not meet quotas could hurt Wells Fargo. A significant drop in productivity, he said, would lead to a drop in revenue. Friday\u2019s results do not reveal the long-term impact of the sales-practice scandal, which broke in mid-September, when the quarter was nearly over. The bank had noticeably higher non-interest expenses in the quarter, due partly to the $185m settlement. In a presentation to investors released on Friday, Wells Fargo reported a drop in what it called banker and teller \u201cinteractions\u201d in September, from both a year previously and from August, before the scandal broke. Consumer checking account openings dropped by 25% from September 2015 and 30% from August 2016. Applications for Wells Fargo credit cards also fell sharply in September. The bank said referrals for mortgages from retail branches were down 24% from August. Retail branch referrals account for 10% of all mortgage originations at what is the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lender. Wells Fargo revenue in the quarter was $22.33bn, up 2% from a year earlier.

      "bodyText": "A landmark trade deal between the EU and Canada is in jeopardy after being rejected by a Belgian regional parliament, raising questions about other agreements such as a future arrangement between the UK and the EU. EU trade ministers hope to sign the deal on Tuesday, but the outcome is in doubt after the Walloon parliament passed a resolution against it on Friday. The EU and Canada have spent seven years negotiating the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA), which would eliminate tariffs on most goods between the two parties. But EU negotiators have said it can only go ahead with the unanimous agreement of all 28 member states. While several countries have raised last-minute problems, Belgium has become a stumbling block that threatens to bring down the deal. Belgium\u2019s federal government supports the trade deal but may be unable to give its consent because of opposition from the Socialist-led Walloon parliament, which has argued that the CETA gives too much power to multinationals. The problems in finalising the CETA hint at the political minefield that the British government will face in agreeing a free trade deal with the EU. Canada is running out of patience with the EU\u2019s problems in finalising the agreement, with formal negotiations having ended in August 2014. Speaking before the Walloon parliament vote on Thursday, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cIf we find in a week or two that Europe is incapable of signing a progressive trade deal with a country like Canada, then who does Europe think it can do business with in the years to come? \u201cIn this post-Brexit [vote] situation, where there are a great many questions about Europe\u2019s usefulness, if Europe cannot manage to sign this agreement, then that sends a very clear message. Not just to Europe, but to the whole world, that Europe is choosing a path that is not productive for its citizens or the world. And that would be a shame.\u201d Following the vote, Trudeau told reporters in Alberta: \u201cWe\u2019ve always known it\u2019s going to require hard work right to the very end. But I\u2019m confident that there are so many strong European countries, like France as we saw, Germany is fully on board, and others, that this deal is going to make it through.\u201d His earlier words were echoed by European leaders, who are increasingly concerned that the EU\u2019s reputation as a trading bloc will be irretrievably damaged by failing to sign a deal with a close ally. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said \u201cemotions and confusion\u201d around the CETA and the parallel transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) with the US were \u201cfuel for Eurosceptics and radicals\u201d. One senior EU diplomat said: \u201cIt is not just about EU-Canada, it is about the future of EU trade policy.\u201d The European commission has drafted a declaration stating that European environmental and health standards will not be diluted. But this failed to convince the minister-president of Wallonia, Paul Magnette, who has vowed to stop Belgium from signing the deal. Insiders familiar with Belgium\u2019s intricate political system said it was possible for the executive to override the Walloon parliament. Last-ditch talks between Belgium\u2019s three regions and the federal government are scheduled for Monday. Even if ministers approve the CETA on Tuesday, this would not be the final hurdle: the agreement would have to be ratified by 28 national and 10 regional European parliaments. EU member states insisted on this final step of parliamentary ratification in a departure from tradition; previously, EU trade policy was signed off by national governments. Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, said: \u201cWhat we are witnessing is a degrading of the authority of the EU to do a lot of things in these areas [trade and commercial policy].\u201d Allowing parliaments to ratify the agreement was \u201can extraordinary decision\u201d, he said. \u201cIt is setting a precedent and having a profoundly undermining effect on EU trade policy, because few countries in the world will want to do trade negotiations with us in the future.\u201d The Labour MEP David Martin, who sits on the European parliament trade committee, said the Wallonian response to the CETA should send shivers down the spine of Brexit negotiators in London. \u201cBritain\u2019s final deal with the EU will too be subject to the whim of 38 national and regional parliaments. As we have seen in Francophone Belgium, public opinion in the rest of Europe is volatile on questions of trade, and deluded Brexiteers will get a shock if they think our partners are going to give us an easy ride.\u201d Supporters of parliamentary ratification say leaving the decision to the EU would have been undemocratic, because the wide-ranging trade agreement affects national politicians\u2019 competences. The increasing role of national parliaments has complicated EU trade policy: the trend means that the parliament of Belgium\u2019s German-speaking community of 76,000 people could, in theory, block a trade agreement between the EU and the UK. EU leaders have suggested that it could take five years or longer to negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK. Erixon said it was too early to tell because the British government had not spelled out its stance on key economic issues that would affect a trade deal, such as farming subsidies, environmental standards and financial services. \u201cNo one really knows yet what we are going to negotiate about. I don\u2019t think the [UK] government knows yet,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Before we close the blog for the day, here is a summary of the main events. Predictably, it\u2019s been Brexit focused. The day began with a message from the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, who said US banks had told him they were definitely planning to move operations out of the UK now that Brexit looks certain to go ahead. The pound has suffered no major lurches, hovering around the $1.22 mark (although it did dip below at one point). It is currently at $1.2208. European markets have built on gains throughout the day, with all the major indices up more than 1% and in some cases up more than 2%. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 is up 1.6% at 341, while the FTSE 100 is up 1% at 7,048. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, told an audience in Nottingham that he is willing to tolerate an inflation overshoot above the Bank\u2019s 2% target. The former chancellor George Osborne decisively threw his weight behind Heathrow airport expansion. US retail sales rebounded in September, while UK construction data showed a surprise fall in output in August. A final point: Traders have been offloading government bonds today following Carney\u2019s inflation comments and fears of a hard Brexit. The yield on benchmark 10-year bonds climbed to 1.14%, up from 0.97% a week ago. On that note, we\u2019ll close up. Thank you for reading the blog and for all the comments. You can follow all the latest breaking Guardian business stories here. Have a great weekend and please join us again on Monday. AM Wall Street has opened higher, with better than expected results from Citigroup and JP Morgan lifting financial stocks. Dow Jones: +0.8% at 18,238 S&amp;P 500: +0.6% at 2,144 Nasdaq: +0.6% at 4,830 Over in Greece today, a conversation that allegedly took place at the height of the euro debt crisis between the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is causing ructions. Did he or didn\u2019t he? That is the question on the lips of many as the fallout from revelations in a book about the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, reverberate around Athens. In the tome, entitled \u201cA president shouldn\u2019t say that\u201d, Hollande is cited as saying Putin had confided that in summer 2015, Tsipras asked him if Russia would consider printing drachma in the event of Athens being ejected from the eurozone. Putin is claimed to have said: \u201cGreece has asked us to print drachma in Russia, since it no longer has a printing press to do it. I wanted to tell you so you understand that we don\u2019t want something like that.\u201d But did Tsipras ever utter such words? Sources close to him swear not \u2013 even if it is now well known that his request for a \u20ac10bn loan from Russia was refused at the time. Earlier today, the deputy defence minister, Dimitris Vitsas, a close confidant, fiercely denied the claim, calling it \u201cnonsense.\u201d Officials in Moscow have also rejected the allegation. With Tsipras and his Syriza party now enthusiastically embracing the eurozone, despite the immense price Athens is paying in terms of bailout-induced austerity, the spat is overshadowing a much-anticipated Syriza congress. In a speech opening the three-day event last night, Tsipras insisted that leaving the euro would have destroyed Greece and was not an alternative the progressive left could adopt. The Prime Minister has met the chief executive of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, to discuss the impact of Brexit. It follows a warning from the Japanese carmaker that it could pull further investment at its Sunderland plant, unless the UK government guarantees compensation for any Brexit-related tariffs it might face in the future. A Nissan spokesman said: The purpose of this meeting between Mr Ghosn and Mrs May is to ensure both Nissan and the UK government have an aligned way forward that meets the needs of both the company and the country. We do not expect any specific agreement to be communicated followin g this initial introductory meeting of the chief executive and the prime minister. Chris Williamson at IHS Markit says the headline rebound in US retail sales in September masks a weaker picture for \u201ccore\u201d sales, which strip out food, fuel and cars. While the September upturn is good news, take a step backwards and it\u2019s clear that the picture is not so bright. The September upturn leaves total sales 0.7% higher in the third quarter, less than half of the 1.5% expansion seen in the second quarter. The data on core sales are even more worrying. Over the third quarter as a whole, core sales were up a mere 0.1% (or 0.4% annualised), which is the worst performance since the second quarter of 2013. It\u2019s core sales which tend to be a better guide to wider measures of consumer spending, so this weakening trend is a big concern and will likely lead to some downward revisions to third quarter GDP forecasts. Retail sales in the US rose by 0.6% in September, following a 0.2% drop in August. The increase was in line with economists\u2019 expectations, and will support expectations that the Fed could raise rates in December. US data for factory gate inflation also suggested price pressures are starting to build, which is likely to further fuel expectations of a hike. James Knightley, senior economist for the UK and US at ING: Overall, the reasonably firm retail sales number and slightly higher inflation data support the idea of a Federal Reserve rate hike in December \u2013 Fed funds futures currently pricing a 66.7% probability of this happening. The only things that can really stop momentum building for such a move would be a market unfriendly election outcome and softness in the two payrolls reports between now and the December Fed meeting. European new car sales rose 7.2% in September, figures published earlier showed. It was slower than the 9.8% growth in the same month last year, held back by weaker sales in the UK. A total of 1.45m new cars were registered last month, according to European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), the highest September total on record. Sales in Italy were up 17.4% over the month at the top end of the table, but sales rose by just 1.6% in the UK. Carlos DaSilva at IHS Markit said there was no sign of a Brexit impact in the data: After a bumpy ride through the summer months, with a disappointing July followed by a surprisingly strong August, the European passenger car market came back to a more normal pattern in September \u2212 one of solid but not outstanding growth. By and large, September was broadly in line with expectations with still no evidence of any impact from the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Britain is committed to leaving the EU, a spokeswoman for Theresa May has said, brushing off a suggestion by the European council president, Donald Tusk, that the country might change its mind. Tusk said on Thursday that Britain was facing a choice between hard Brexit or no Brexit. May\u2019s spokeswoman said: The prime minister has been very clear ... that the British people have made their decision and we are now going to get on with that, with taking the UK out of the EU and on making the most of the opportunities ahead. The spokeswoman pointed out that Tusk had said Brexit talks should be approached in good faith: That is the sort of spirit the prime minister wants to encourage and foster with other European partners, that we approach this constructively. There are opportunities both for the UK and for the EU with the decision to leave and so we now need to come together, work together effectively to agree on a new arrangement, a new relationship that can work in the interests of all of us. Weak UK construction data for August shows that the government needs to invest more in infrastructure, according to the TUC. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, says: Today\u2019s construction figures are a timely reminder for the chancellor. We are not building enough homes, roads and railways. Philip Hammond must use next month\u2019s autumn statement to green light investment in housebuilding, high-speed rail and a new runway at Heathrow. With investors twitchy after Brexit, the government needs to step up. Mark Carney has said he is willing to tolerate an overshoot of the Bank of England\u2019s 2% inflation target. The governor\u2019s comments suggest that the Bank\u2019s policymakers will focus on supporting economic growth through low interest rates following the Brexit vote, rather than acting to bring inflation down. Speaking at an event in Nottingham, Carney said: Our judgment in the summer was that we could have seen another 400,000-500,000 people unemployed over the course of the next few years. So we\u2019re willing to tolerate a bit of overshoot in inflation over the course of the next few years in order to avoid that situation, to cushion the blow. UK inflation was 0.6% in August, well below the 2% target. But the Bank and other commentators have warned that inflation will soon start to rise, as the sharp fall in the pound since the Brexit vote starts to feed through to higher import prices. Carney also conceded that it\u2019s \u201cgoing to get difficult\u201d for people on lower incomes as prices start to rise at a faster pace. The former chancellor George Osborne has made it very clear that he is not ready for a quiet life on the backbenches. In a series of tweets on the controversial and long running subject of UK airport expansion, Osborne decisively backed Heathrow. A formal decision is expected next Tuesday ... The former chancellor George Osborne has said Britain must work hard to retain its status as the world\u2019s financial centre. Comments this morning from Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, show that London\u2019s rival European cities for finance are prepared for a fight to win business in the post-Brexit vote world. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the weak construction data suggests that the sector has relapsed into recession. He adds: The construction sector\u2019s outlook will brighten if the chancellor cancels planned cuts to public sector investment in next month\u2019s autumn statement. But with firms\u2019 investment intentions still depressed by the Brexit vote, commercial construction work looks set to fall sharply. Meanwhile, the recent flat trend in housing starts and skilled labour shortages suggest that housebuilding will continue to track sideways for now. Supplementary point on Marmite-gate ... The detail of the UK construction output data shows the biggest drag in August came from a 5.1% monthly drop in infrastructure building. It followed a 6.1% increase in July. The ONS said infrastructure is particularly volatile because of \u201cthe range of products that are included within this type of work\u201d. That sub-sector of the construction industry covers a range of big projects such as windfarms, roads, railways and nuclear plants. New house building meanwhile fell by 1.3% over the month. As far as investors are concerned, Tesco came out on top following its spat with product supplier Unilever over prices. Tesco is the FTSE 100\u2019s best performer this morning, with shares up 3.9%. Unilever on the other hand is near the bottom of the pack, with shares down 0.4%. Construction output fell 1.5% in August, surprisings economists who had forecast a 0.2% rise. The slightly better news was that the Office for National Statistics revised up the figure for July from zero to 0.5% growth. Kate Davies, a statistician with the ONS, said the fall didn\u2019t appear to be related to the Brexit vote: Construction output has fallen back quite sharply in recent months and contracted by 1.5% in August. As the fall this month is led by infrastructure, it seems unlikely that post-referendum uncertainties are having an impact. Monthly construction data can be quite erratic, though, so we would warn against trying to read too much into one set of figures. The annual rate of growth in construction output was 0.2% in August, better than July\u2019s -1% but much weaker than the 1.5% predicted by economists. Berenberg\u2019s \u201cchart of the week\u201d is entitled migration to Germany: beyond the big surge. The German bank says the number of new arrivals has fallen sharply this year for a number of reasons, including the German government\u2019s decision to tighten its policies since early 2016. It follows a huge surge in 2015, when about 890,000 asylum seekers went to Germany, adding 1.1% to the resident population. The equivalent annual number for 2016 is about 160,000-170,000, which the bank says should be manageable in \u201ceconomic, fiscal and political terms\u201d. Here is the chart: Holger Schmieding, chief economist, says: Providing for the migrants and refugees is adding to German government spending. Partly as a result of this, the growth rate of government consumption in Germany has risen from an average of 2.5% year on year in the first half of 2015 to 4.1% in the first half of 2016. This amounts to a fiscal stimulus worth 0.3% of GDP. The mostly state-financed consumer spending of migrants and refugees and the impact on housing construction add to that. The pound has fallen below $1.22, currently down 0.6% at $1.2176. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says the Brexit comments from French finance minister Michel Sapin, and those from Donald Tusk on Thursday (\u201cit\u2019s hard Brexit or no Brexit\u201d) are weighing on the pound: The President of the European Council (Donald Tusk) poured cold water on the idea, propounded by Boris Johnson, that Britain could potentially strike a better deal with the EU post-Brexit, claiming that a hard exit is the only offer on the table. Sapin, the French finance minister, then stated this morning that some US banks are already looking to move their operations out of London in favour of the continent. Unsurprisingly this kind of rhetoric hasn\u2019t been welcomed by the pound, which has fallen half a percent against the dollar and 0.1% against the euro. While this keeps sterling above the week\u2019s (and, indeed, decades\u2019) lows, that fact will provide mere crumbs of comfort for the currency. The FTSE 100 is faring better, as Campbell points out: As for the FTSE, the abrupt end to Marmite-gate last night, with Tesco and Unilever coming to a price agreement, and a rebound from its mining stocks has allowed the UK index to climb back above the 7000 mark. Higher food prices pushed official inflation in China to 1.9% in September, from 1.3% in August. It was higher than the 1.6% predicted by economists, and helped to ease investor fears about the health of the world\u2019s second largest economy after disappointing trade data on Thursday unnerved global markets. Producer prices (or factory gate prices) also rose unexpectedly in September for the first time in almost five years because of higher commodity prices. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said it was good news: In an encouraging sign this morning\u2019s Chinese consumer prices inflation data does appear to show that inflation is gaining traction, with CPI coming in at 1.9%, above expectations. Factory gate prices still remain sluggish, though they have finally made it into positive territory at 0.1%, the first time that has happened since February 2012. Chinese PPi prices have been slowly improving for several months now so this return to positive territory is welcome news, especially so when prices were -5.9% at the beginning of this year. After hitting an record intraday high on Tuesday, the FTSE 100 slipped back below 7,000 on Thursday when disappointing trade data from China hit mining stocks. It\u2019s a different story this morning, with European markets up across the board: FTSE 100: +0.6% at 7,021 FTSE 250: +0.4% at 17,956 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.6% at 10,476 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 4,438 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 16,353 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.9% at 8,683 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.7% at 338 Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s says the pound could lose its status as a save haven currency following the Brexit vote. Ravi Bhatia, S&amp;P\u2019s director of sovereign ratings for Britain, told the Telegraph: To be a reserve currency means that the world has trust in you and is happy to hold its savings in your currency. It creates a pool of available capital. If you lose this and sterling becomes just another currency, a key advantage is lost. He also suggested some complacency on the part of the UK government as it prepares to negotiate its way out of the EU: There seems to be this view that \u2018we\u2019re a big important economy, the Europeans export a lot to us, so they have got to give us what we want\u2019, but is that really true? The pound is down slightly against the dollar this morning, by 0.4%, but is just about managing to stay above the $1.22 level. It is currently at $1.2206. It is also holding steady against the euro, down -0.1% at \u20ac1.1075. European markets have opened higher. Full details to follow. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Marmite-gate might have been settled for now (read here how yesterday\u2019s dramatic events unfolded), but there are other tales this morning of how Brexit might negatively affect Britain. The French finance minister Michel Sapin has told a press conference in Paris that US banks are definitely pressing ahead with plans to move some operations out of the UK in favour of other European countries. Sapin was in Washington last week for the IMF meetings and he says that now that Britain\u2019s exit form the EU seems certain, US banks are busy making plans to leave the UK. Paris, of course, would welcome the banks with open arms, but it will undoubtedly encounter stiff competition from other cities such as Frankfurt. Of course we\u2019ve heard it all before that banks will consider moving out of London, but Sapin suggests the plans have moved up a gear. Here is what he had to say about US banks: For them, until now, the question was \u2018will Brexit take place? Will it really be implemented? You talk about two years but maybe it will last three or four years?\u2019. That\u2019s over now, there\u2019s no more of that. It\u2019s no longer \u2018will there be\u2019 or \u2018if\u2019 there\u2019s a Brexit. It\u2019s \u2018there will be a Brexit in two years and after two years we will have to take decisions. Sapin said some banks had already decided that activities will be transferred to the continent. Those are their words, not mine. [It is an] inevitable outcome, whatever the result of the Brexit negotiations.",

A report from Euler Hermes, the world\u2019s largest trade credit insurer, this week said hard Brexit would put more than 1,400 UK companies into insolvency. They argued that much of the damage would come from falling trade levels and lower consumer confidence. The pound has been in freefall. This week, it went below $1.22 and \u20ac1.11 and there is no floor in sight. I had expected sterling to drop to a low of maybe $1.20, but even I hadn\u2019t expected the fall to be so rapid. It is not implausible that the pound could reach parity with the dollar. That isn\u2019t good. Every time the prime minister or her band of hardline Brexiter ministers prognosticate on their plans for a hard Brexit, the pound drops precipitously. Various EU leaders have made it clear that the terms the UK is proposing are unacceptable and impossible. Surprise, surprise. The experts said that would happen all along, Mr Gove. The worry is that there is no credible opposition to hold the government to account. The Labour party is 17 points behind in the polls. The markets appear to have no confidence in the negotiating powers of the government. Bond yields have risen. Theresa May is already being called \u201cMayhem\u201d, as she has increased the risk premium the UK will have to pay to borrow. As Martin Wolf noted in the Financial Times (\u00a3): \u201cUnwise words have consequences.\u201d The markets, thankfully, will probably prevent the government from doing or saying more stupid stuff. Some have argued that the pound is overvalued and the fall is welcomed. The drop is clearly a boost to the UK economy, as it makes exports cheaper, but a weaker pound lowers living standards, as the price of imported goods rises. Voting for sovereignty was all very well, but the question is: at what price? What if there is a 5%, or even 10%, or a not inconceivable 20% drop in living standards? Then sovereignty doesn\u2019t look so great. A good way of getting at the extent to which the pound is overvalued is the Big Mac index, which looks at whether currencies are at their \u201ccorrect\u201d level. The cost of a burger and bun is worked out and the price calculated in dollar terms. In July 2016, UK burgers cost less than in Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, the US, Canada, Denmark, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and the eurozone.

      "bodyText": "The Libyan Investment Authority has lost its $1.2bn lawsuit against Goldman Sachs in the high court. The judgment was handed down in London on Friday by Mrs Justice Rose who presided over the high-profile case that began in June with allegations of Goldman bankers paying for prostitutes, private jets and five-star hotels to win business from the Libyan sovereign wealth fund set up under the Gaddafi regime. The LIA was claiming $1.2bn (\u00a3846m) from the Wall Street investment bank for losses on nine complex share trades between January and April 2008. The LIA had argued that the case involved \u201cabuse of trust, undue influence and unconscionable bargain\u201d, alleging that the investment bank exploited its limited financial experience. But Goldman disputed the claim, which was filed in 2014, as a case of buyer\u2019s remorse. The LIA left open the prospect it might appeal. \u201cThe Libyan Investment Authority is naturally disappointed with the judgment \u2026 Time will be needed fully to digest the judgment and all options are being considered at this time,\u201d the $60bn fund said. Goldman described the result as \u201ca comprehensive judgment in our favour\u201d. Rose heard evidence from the LIA that Goldman had lavished hospitality on its staff to win business from the cash-rich fund \u2013 but rejected the contention that this meant the bankers could exert influence over the fund. In her judgment, she said: \u201cI find that there was no protected relationship of trust and confidence between the LIA and Goldman Sachs. Their relationship did not go beyond the normal cordial and mutually beneficial relationship that grows up between a bank and a client. Goldman Sachs did not become a trusted adviser or a \u2018man of affairs\u2019 for the LIA.\u201d Nor, she said, did Goldman take advantage of the LIA\u2019s misunderstanding of the complexity of the trades. \u201cI find that the key people in the LIA who needed to understand the trades did discuss and agree the structure of the trades with Goldman Sachs,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough the disputed trades may be regarded as unsuitable for a sovereign wealth fund, there were other reasons why the LIA wanted to enter into them and, if they were unsuitable, they were no different from many other investments that the LIA made over the period in that regard,\u201d she said. She also said that a Goldman internship offered to Haitem Zarti \u2013 the brother of Mustafa Zarti, the LIA\u2019s former deputy chief \u2013 had not had an influence in LIA\u2019s decision to enter into the trades.",

      "bodyText": "The British financial trader accused of manipulating the US stock markets on the day of an $800bn (\u00a3565bn) \u201cflash crash\u201d faces extradition within 28 days after being denied permission to appeal against the order. Navinder Singh Sarao, 37, nicknamed the Hound of Hounslow, must now be sent to America and surrendered to the US authorities. After a two-and-a-half-hour hearing at the court of appeal in London on Friday, Lord Justice Gross and Justice Nicol denied a renewed application to appeal against extradition. Their reasons are to be given at a later date. The counsel for the US acknowledged there was no longer a suggestion that Sarao had played a significant role in provoking the flash crash. During the 36-minute crash, on 6 May 2010, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted by 998.5 points \u2013 its biggest slump during a single trading session. \u201cThis is a case about the \u2018spoofing\u2019 of the US market over five years,\u201d counsel for the US told the high court. Spoofing is the placing of an electronic order on an exchange with the intent of giving others a false impression of market demand. After the price reacted to that alleged deception, Sarao, who traded from his parents\u2019 home in west London, is alleged to have bought or sold stock knowing he could cancel the spoof order. He is accused of making $40m from spoofing between 2009 and 2014.

      "bodyText": "The risk of electricity blackouts in Britain this winter has diminished, after the National Grid and the government spent more than \u00a3140m on tools designed to guarantee the lights stay on. The Grid\u2019s capacity margin, the cushion between electricity demand and supply, has risen to 6.6%, beating its summer prediction of 5.5%. The buffer zone is also well ahead of last year\u2019s \u201ctight but manageable\u201d 5.1%, which was the lowest in a decade. In its annual winter outlook, the firm that operates the UK\u2019s electricity transmission network said it expects average peak demand of 52.7GW during cold weather, with 55GW of supply capacity available. The improved position is partly down to a reprieve for the Eggborough coal power plant in North Yorkshire, which was due to shut down before the winter but will stay partly operational until March 2017. The margin was also boosted by a breakdown in the UK\u2019s electricity interconnector with Ireland, which usually results in more electricity flowing out than in. \u201cSince publishing the provisional winter margin in July, additional electricity generation has been made available to the market,\u201d said Phil Sheppard, the Grid\u2019s director of system operations. \u201cThis has had a positive impact on the outlook for winter, increasing the margin between potential supply and demand.\u201d While the extra availability of power from Eggborough made blackouts less likely, the Grid also bought tools designed to ensure the lights won\u2019t go out. The UK\u2019s electricity system operator spent \u00a3122m on supplemental balancing reserve contracts, which pay power plants to be on standby in case of outages elsewhere or a sudden surge in demand. These included \u00a377m of payments to the Eggborough and Fiddler\u2019s Ferry power plants and will add about \u00a31.80 to the average annual bill. The Grid said it expected to have to activate these contracts at some point this winter, meaning the plants would be put on standby and could be asked to generate electricity. This is most likely to happen during the week beginning 9 January, when the weather is likely to be cold and several power plants have planned outages scheduled. The government has also spent about \u00a322m on 0.8GW demand-side response contracts, where firms agree to reduce or shift their power usage, according to an estimate from the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) thinktank. Without these measures, the Grid said the capacity margin would have been just 1.1%. \u201cThe increased cushion between supply and demand in this year\u2019s winter outlook shows that power cuts are exceedingly unlikely,\u201d said Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the ECIU. \u201cA boost on last year \u2013 when there were no issues in the system \u2013 shows that the UK continues to have a reliable electricity system as we go through this period of transition.While the costs are slightly higher this year, they account for just 0.3% of the average electricity bill, an unavoidable cost as the UK faces up to the task of replacing huge amounts of ageing infrastructure over the next decade.\u201d This winter is the last before reform of the electricity market ushers in a completely different system of power supply designed to render such tools unnecessary. Britain will also be \u201cwell supplied\u201d with gas for heating, the Grid said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There was a surprise slowdown in Britain\u2019s construction industry in August, although statisticians played down any link between the dip and Brexit jitters. The Office for National Statistics said construction output had fallen by 1.5% in August, after a rise of 0.5% in July. That defied expectations of a small increase of 0.2% in a Reuters poll of economists and will add to fears the sector acted as a drag on overall economic growth in the third quarter. The ONS cautioned that monthly data could be choppy and noted that the drop in construction in August had been driven by a 5.1% fall in infrastructure output. That subsector of the construction industry covers big projects such as windfarms, roads, railways and nuclear plants and its output data can be volatile. Infrastructure output rose by 6.1% in July. \u201cConstruction output has fallen back quite sharply in recent months and contracted by 1.5% in August. As the fall this month is led by infrastructure, it seems unlikely that post-referendum uncertainties are having an impact,\u201d said the ONS\u2019s senior statistician, Kate Davies. \u201cMonthly construction data can be quite erratic, so we would warn against trying to read too much into one set of figures.\u201d Looking at the underlying pattern of construction, which makes up 6% of the economy, output decreased by 1.3% in the three months to August from the previous quarter. In year-on-year terms, August\u2019s output was up just 0.2%. Survey responses from construction firms in September pointed to conditions in the industry stabilising but it still looked vulnerable, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which publishes polls on the industry. Its latest report on construction suggested the sector bounced back from a post-referendum slump last month after a surge in housebuilding. Williamson said: \u201cUK construction activity fell sharply in August, putting the sector on course for its worst quarter in four years and at risk of heading back into recession. \u201cSurvey data provides a ray of hope, suggesting conditions may have stabilised in September, but it\u2019s clear that the sector remains under pressure from widespread uncertainty about the economic outlook and that growth has, at the very least, consequently slowed considerably since earlier in the year.\u201d There are hopes that measures in Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement next month, such as a possible push on housebuilding, could bolster the construction sector. But Scott Bowman, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the environment was generally tough for construction firms. \u201cConstruction\u2019s fortunes are unlikely to improve much in coming quarters as the Brexit vote weighs on the sector,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do think the leave vote will have more of an impact on the sector in the coming quarters \u2013 due to the large-scale, irreversible nature of many projects. What\u2019s more, recent reports suggest that the labour shortages that have been weighing on the sector are still firmly in place.\u201d The figures follow news last week of a fall in industrial output in August and a widening in Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world. That data broke a run of upbeat reports on the UK\u2019s post-referendum economy. The mixed outlook, and the pound\u2019s dramatic slump on worries over a potentially damaging hard Brexit deal, leave the Bank of England in a difficult position as it decides whether to cut interest rates further next month. Official borrowing costs were trimmed to a record low of 0.25% in August and policymakers have hinted they could be cut further, to about 0.1%, before the end of the year.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are on the rise again after a couple of days of uncertainty on concerns about the prospects for the UK once Brexit finally happens. But with Chinese inflation showing signs of picking up - a positive for the state of the country\u2019s economy - mining shares are helping to push the leading index higher. So the FTSE 100 is currently up 40.10 points at 7017.84, albeit well below the record 7129 achieved earlier in the week. Rio Tinto has risen 59p to \u00a326.35 following the Chinese data, while BHP Billiton is 23.5p better at 1207.5p, helped by analysts at Credit Suisse raising their target price from \u00a311.50 to \u00a313. But the biggest riser so far is Tesco, up 6.35p at 201.45p after settling the Marmite dispute with Unilever, down 27p at 3569.5p. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: The abrupt end to Marmite-gate last night, with Tesco and Unilever coming to a price agreement, and a rebound from its mining stocks has allowed the UK index to climb back above the 7000 mark. The Eurozone indices were similarly robust in their gains this Friday, the DAX and CAC rising 0.8% and 1% respectively. But the pound has slipped back again on Brexit worries, down 0.5% at $1.2191. Elsewhere hedge fund group Man has jumped 15p to 123.7p after it reported strong third quarter figures, with quarterly funds under management up 6%. It also announced the purchase of asset manager Aalto, as well as a proposed $100m share buyback. In a buy note, Liberum said: Man Group is a long way from firing on all cylinders and arguably the time to buy it is in anticipation of that. We are not suggesting that is going to happen immediately but after recent share price weakness (-28% in last 6 months) we believe there is enough in today\u2019s statement to reignite interest. Assets under management progress is broadly in-line, there is an interesting bolt-on acquisition and also the launch of a $100m share repurchase should all ensure the shares head towards our target price of 125p.",

    "webTitle": "Coal price rally raises Australian hopes \u2013 but it won't last, say economists", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The rally in the price of key exports such as coal and iron ore that has promised a multibillion-dollar windfall for Australia\u2019s treasurer, Scott Morrison, could be shortlived, economists have warned. Hopes have risen that the federal budget could benefit from as much as $23bn in additional tax revenues from exports, thanks to higher prices, especially for coal which has more than doubled in price in the past four months. But Australia remains at the mercy of trends in its biggest markets China and India, and economists say it\u2019s not clear how long the rally in commodity prices will last. Tim Buckley, from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said global demand for coal was expected to fall 2.7% in 2016 despite recent spikes in demand following surprise cuts in production in China and India, the world\u2019s two biggest importers. China curbed domestic coal production at the same time hydro production was falling 13% in September, pushing up reliance on coal imports. India, meanwhile, was also forced to curb production when its coal inventories spiked to 88m tonnes. \u201cThe price has overshot,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cBoth big importers had aberrations in September so it has pushed the price back up.\u201d China on Friday recorded its first rise in factory-gate prices in four years. Economists at NAB agreed with Buckley, saying the unexpectedly high settlement price for coking coal \u2013 which is used to make steel \u2013 would \u201cprovide a boost to Australia\u2019s terms of trade, nominal GDP and government revenues\u201d. The bank\u2019s chief economist, Alan Ostler, said the higher coking-coal price alone could add $12.5bn to the federal budget in the next two years and help ease the current budget shortfall of $37bn, or 2.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). The federal budget deficit came in $1.33bn under its end-of-August forecast thanks to stronger revenues and lower spending, figures released on Friday showed. The budgets of states such as Queensland and New South Wales will also benefit hugely from increased royalty taxes. But the longer-term reality was likely to be different, Ostler said, and the rise in prices was \u201cunlikely to be sustained\u201d. The bank also believes the iron ore price will fall back from its current level of just over $55.94 a tonne \u2013 just over Morrison\u2019s budget forecast \u2013 to $44 a tonne in 2017. Global coal production peaked in 2014, Buckley said, and action on setting a carbon price following agreement on the Paris climate accord could continue to suppress demand. Despite the hopes of the federal resources minister, Josh Frydenberg, that India would provide a burgeoning market for Australian coal even if the current number-one market of China slows, Buckley said India\u2019s energy minister, Piyush Goyal, had vowed to cease all coal imports within three years. Many doubt the prediction but Buckley said: \u201cI think he\u2019ll do it. The cost of new solar power is less than the cost of new coal \u2013 4.5 rupees per kilowatt hour (US$0.67) compared with 6 rupees for imported coal. \u201cSolar has dropped in price way faster than anyone said it would. It is 40% cheaper than it was 18 months ago.\u201d",
