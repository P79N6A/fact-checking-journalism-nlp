      "bodyText": "The government threw a lifeline to the UK's beleaguered high street in its autumn statement on Thursday, with a package of measures designed to show it is on the side of struggling small shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants. Small business owners with premises worth up to \u00a350,000 will be entitled to a discount of up to \u00a31,000 on their business rates for the next two years, the chancellor said. And, as widely expected, he promised to limit rises in business rates to 2% and extended the small business rate relief scheme to April 2015. Businesses will also be allowed to pay their rates in 12 monthly instalments. In a bid to end the scourge of empty shops which dominates many town centres, the chancellor also unveiled a \"reoccupation relief\" \u2013 the halving of business rates for entrepreneurs who set up shop in vacant stores. Currently, an average of one in six premises stands empty, and this week Blockbuster was the latest name to disappear from the high street after administrators failed to find a buyer for the DVD and games rental chain, closing its remaining 62 stores. For pubs alone, the measures will have a huge impact. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association said the decision to extend small business rate relief would see thousands of pubs collectively avoid a \u00a327m bill. At the same time, 38,000 (three in four) pubs will get the \u00a31,000 reduction in their rates, as they have a valuation of less than \u00a350,000. The chancellor also announced measures to abolish employer national insurance contributions for those who are younger than 21, which will slash the wage bills of retailers of all sizes, which employ more people of that age than any other private sector industry. Helen Dickinson, British Retail Consortium director general, said: \"The chancellor has recognised that businesses are suffering, and is right to listen to retailers' concerns on business rates. The BRC has campaigned for a 2% cap and reform of the business rates system, and it is extremely welcome to hear it announced. \"With the additional measures on NI, retailers will be encouraged to do even more to support the aspirations of young people \u2013 40% of all jobs for those under 20 are in retail, and this will help retailers provide secure career opportunities for young people.\"",
