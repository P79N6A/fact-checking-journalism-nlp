      "bodyText": "When Teresa Cervantes entered her manager\u2019s office at a Chicago McDonald\u2019s, a different manager asked what she wanted, as Cervantes recounted in Spanish during a one-day strike of McDonald\u2019s workers, outside the Chicago corporate headquarters on Tuesday. The manager asked if she was there for \u201cpito\u201d \u2013 a word for male genitalia \u2013 since Cervantes\u2019 boss was known for pressuring workers to have sex in the office or store bathrooms, said Cervantes, who worked at the city\u2019s famous Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll McDonald\u2019s and other locations. \u201cI told her I\u2019m not that kind of worker, I was just trying to be a responsible worker,\u201d requesting a schedule change since her two kids were starting school, she explained. Workers who spoke at the rally \u2013 billed as a #MeToo moment for McDonald\u2019s \u2013 described sexual abuse, coercion and harassment as everyday occurrences in the restaurants. They said McDonald\u2019s has done little to address the problem, despite complaints filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on behalf of 15 workers in 2016 and 10 more filed earlier this year. Workers at McDonald\u2019s restaurants in 10 cities nationwide walked off the job on Tuesday to demand that the company address sexual abuse and harassment, including by forming a committee comprised of workers, corporate and franchise representatives, and national women\u2019s groups. Organizers said this was the first nationwide strike ever called specifically to protest sexual harassment. \u201cWe\u2019re breaking our silence, we\u2019re making history,\u201d said Cervantes, whose daughter also works at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cSo youth will have a better future.\u201d Workers described the company\u2019s lack of action on sexual harassment as part of a larger culture of disrespecting and exploiting workers. They noted that the company has aggressively resisted attempts by workers to join a labor union, and workers\u2019 demands that it pay $15 an hour. Workers affiliated with the Fight for $15 campaign voted to go on strike, and the action was supported by various labor and women\u2019s groups. Forty percent of female fast food workers reported they had been sexually harassed, in a 2016 survey by Hart Research Associates conducted for the National Partnership for Women and Families, the Ms Foundation and Futures Without Violence. Adriana Alvarez, 26, noted that she went on strike for a day in the spring when the latest EEOC complaints were filed. Since she felt McDonald\u2019s has done nothing to improve the situation, she was eager to again walk out of the McDonald\u2019s she works at in the Chicago suburb of Cicero. \u201cThe public doesn\u2019t know what we go through, behind the counters, in the bathrooms, in the janitors closets,\u201d she said. \u201cI really hope this does make a statement. We\u2019re sick and tired of having to deal with this.\u201d Aiesha Meadows, 26, worked at McDonald\u2019s at O\u2019Hare international airport from 2010 to 2013. She said sexual harassment was rampant, but she and other workers felt they couldn\u2019t speak out for fear of losing their jobs. \u201cThey just brush it off the table,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to say anything because at the end of the day we need to feed our families.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s walkouts and rallies also happened in Durham, Kansas City, Missouri, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Orlando, San Francisco and St Louis. McDonald\u2019s did not respond to a request for comment. Workers said the #MeToo movement, which started with actresses and other high-profile people, has inspired low-wage workers to speak out about sexual harassment that they say is systemic in their workplaces. \u201cThis happens to everybody,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cIt cuts across all classes.\u201d Ali Baker has worked for a decade as a server, fast-food worker and barista, and experienced sexual harassment often, she said. She is a member-leader with the Restaurant Opportunity Center, an organization which brings together restaurant management and workers to change working conditions. \u201cI\u2019ve been backed into a corner by my boss, I\u2019ve been kissed by my manager, I\u2019ve had my legs groped, I\u2019ve been put in uncomfortable situations where it was easier to go along,\u201d she told the crowd outside McDonald\u2019s new corporate headquarters and Hamburger University in Chicago\u2019s trendy West Loop neighborhood. But no more. \u201cIt\u2019s time to say, \u2018I\u2019m not on the menu,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cTime\u2019s up, McDonald\u2019s!\u201d",

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on today\u2019s trade war action: China is to slap tariffs on an additional $60bn (\u00a356bn) of imports from the US in retaliation against $200bn of new US import tariffs announced by Donald Trump. The latest moves represent a new step towards a full-scale trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. Further escalation is deemed likely because Trump is facing low approval ratings ahead of the US midterm elections while China will not want to be seen to back down. Trump announced his latest escalation of the bitter trade standoff between the two countries late on Monday, promising to introduce the additional border taxes of 10% on Chinese goods from next week. The tariffs \u2013 designed to make US domestic products more competitive against foreign imports \u2013 apply to almost 6,000 items, including consumer goods such as luggage and electronics, housewares and foods. The US president threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods if Beijing unveils retaliatory measures \u2013 a step that would mean tariffs on all Chinese imports to the US and equate to 4% of world trade. The trade war was already unpopular with some US citizens, even before today\u2019s escalation. CNBC explains: A quarter of registered voters nationally think raising tariffs will do more to protect American jobs and help the U.S. economy, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in July. Meanwhile, about half of registered voters said duties will do more to raise the costs of goods or hurt the economy. Sixteen percent responded that levies will not have much of an effect. More here. President Trump\u2019s attack on China\u2019s alleged electoral interference may be an attempt to rally public support for the plan. My colleague Simon Tisdall fears that the trade war could spark a deeper dispute between the US and China. He points out that president Xi is under growing pressure to respond to Trump\u2019s actions, and fault lines are building... Stepped-up efforts by Chinese air and naval forces to intercept or prevent \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d patrols by American (and British) warships in the South China Sea could be another unintended consequence of Trump\u2019s trade war. Until now, the two issues have been kept separate. But what if a frustrated Xi, who has been attacked at home for being both too hardline and too soft over tariffs, decided to conflate them? Likewise, the Trump administration last week criticised China\u2019s repression of the Muslim Uighur minority in Xinjiang. That unexpected intervention, though backed by the UN and human rights organisations, was seen in Beijing as another gratuitously provocative (and ill-timed) assault on its sovereignty and national interests. Growing US-China strategic rivalry is a fact of 21st century life. Yet at present, Trump is relying on Chinese restraint in a wide range of problem areas as he focuses obsessively on his trade vendetta. It cannot be assumed Xi will be content indefinitely to play the role of \u201cadult in the room\u201d. His patience could snap. Few people predict a new cold war, just yet. But the warning signs are there for all to see. Reuters has analysed China\u2019s new tariffs on US goods, and found that they are less severe than Beijing proposed last month. Here\u2019s the details: China will levy tariffs on a total of 5,207 U.S. products, at 5% and 10%, instead of the previously proposed rates of 5%, 10%, 20% and 25%, even as the products remain unchanged from the previous plan, the finance ministry said. China will impose a 10% tariff on U.S. products it previously designated for a rate of 20% and 25%, and 5% tariffs on goods previously under the 5% and 10% rates. Items previously designated to be hit by 20% or 25% tariffs included products ranging from liquefied natural gas and mineral ores to coffee and various types of edible oil. Those goods will now be taxed 10%. Goods previously marked under the 10% category included products such as frozen vegetables, cocoa powder and chemical products. Those products will now be taxed 5%. That all adds up to less of an impact on US exporters, and also less pain for Chinese customers (because tariffs are paid by domestic consumers). The boss of Apple, Tim Cook, says he\u2019s optimistic that the US and China will reach a ceasefire in the trade war. Reuters has the details: Apple Inc chief executive Tim Cook, whose products have been spared from new U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese goods, said on Tuesday he was optimistic that the United States and China will eventually work through their trade differences. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic because trade is one of those things where it\u2019s not a zero-sum game,\u201d Cook told ABC News\u2019 \u201cGood Morning America\u201d program on Tuesday. \u201cWe can trade something and we can both win. So I\u2019m optimistic that the two countries will sort this out and life will go on.\u201d Fawad Razaqzada of Forex.com says global investors are relieved that China hasn\u2019t unleashed a more severe reaction against Donald Trump today. China\u2019s latest move is measured and not over-aggressive as it now plans to impose 10% tariffs on US goods that it had previously listed for a 20-25% tariff rate. Likewise, the items that were listed for 10% will now only face a 5% tariff. So it looks like China has blinked first, and this puts the US government in a great position to agree on a new trade deal. Over in New York, investors are shrugging off these latest blows in the trade war. Wall Street has opened higher, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 85 points or 0.33%. China adds that it will \u201crespond accordingly\u201d in future, if the US insists in raising tariff rates. So it doesn\u2019t agree that it is out of bullets, as commerce secretary Wilbur Ross claims. The Chinese government says it hopes America stops creating \u201ctrade frictions\u201d, and instead maintains a \u201cmutually beneficial trade relationship\u201d. Boom! China has announced retaliatory action against America, as the trade war intensifies further. Beijing says it will impose tariffs of up to 10% on $60bn of US imports, starting on 24 September. These new levies will cover around 5,000 American products, including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour (according to a provisional list released last month) In a statement, the Chinese government says this is a \u201cforced response\u201d to America\u2019s new tariffs on $200bn of its goods overnight. More to follow! Boom: Donald Trump has promised to impose further economic retaliations against China, if it tries to hurt his patriotic supporters. The US president has tweeted that China is trying to interfere in US elections (it makes a change from Russia....), and pledged to retaliate: Here\u2019s a clip from Wilber Ross\u2019s interview, arguing that American families won\u2019t really notice the impact of 10% tariffs on $200bn of good from China. By my reckoning, it works out as an extra $160 for every family in the US ($20bn of levies / 126m US households). Of course, some retailers might swallow the tariff themselves, or simply refuse to pay it and buy goods from elsewhere instead. Wilbur Ross also claims that the trade war has strengthened the bonds between the US, the European Union and Japan: The US and the EU didn\u2019t look particularly close this summer, when president Trump imposed tariffs on steel imports, and Europe retaliated with levies on orange juice, motorbikes and cranberries from America..... Is Wilbur Ross correct to claim that China is \u201cout of bullets\u201d to fight a trade war? By one measure, yes. The US only exported $130bn to China last year. Beijing already imposes tariffs on $50bn worth, so it can\u2019t match America\u2019s $200bn move. But such a narrow view ignores the full interconnected nature of the global economy. China can use other tools if it really wants to make things hot for America. For example it could: Launch a currency war by letting the yuan tumble against the US dollar. That would counter the impact of higher tariffs. Limit US firms from accessing China\u2019s market. That would hurt manufacturers who hope to profit from China\u2019s economic revolution, and the sharp increase in middle-class consumers Stop buying US government debt, or even dump its huge stock of Treasury bills onto the market. That would force up America\u2019s cost of borrowing, and potentially rock the markets (currently, China recycles some of the dollars it receives from trade back into US bonds, helping America to service its huge national debt). President Xi might have other ideas to thwart America in the international sphere, of course (last week he was making a big show of friendship with Russia\u2019s president Putin). US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is up early, appearing on CNBC to discuss the new tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports announced by Donald Trump last night. Ross declared it is up to Beijing to decide whether to address America\u2019s concerns over free trade and intellectual property rights. He says: \u201cOur purpose is to have constructive negotiations with the Chinese to resolve the fundamental issues. So the question about whether or when to have a discussion is very importantly in their ballpark.\u201d Ross also argued that the tariffs (on everything from frozen turbot to bicycle speedometers) had been carefully chosen to create the smallest disruption to consumers. Ross also dipped into the firearms metaphor bucket, denying that America was shooting from the him and claiming that Beijing was \u201cout of bullets\u201d (because it imports so little, relatively, from America). Larry Hatheway, chief economist at asset manager GAM, believes investors aren\u2019t taking the trade war seriously enough. Having seen markets rise in Asia and Europe today, Hatheway warns that the situation could deteriorate sharply, hurting the global economy. \u201cWithout question, tariffs are economically counterproductive and create inefficiencies in supply chains, location of production and add costs to firms and consumers. Criticism of the new tariffs from key US business and consumer groups was immediate. Investors may also be hoping that the US mid-term election outcome might temper the Trump Administration\u2019s willingness to escalate trade tensions. \u201cBut risks remain. One is the unclear rhetoric from the US Trump Administration, which has put forward a variety of explanations for tariffs (elimination of bilateral trade deficits, measures to counter intellectual property right infringement, objections to China\u2019s investment in new technologies, etc). That makes it difficult to know what the basis for an agreement to diffuse the situation might look like. \u201cIn light of today\u2019s market reaction, investors risk being overly complacent about the eventual outcome, which could still escalate with potentially very adverse spill over effects on broader economic activity.\u201d Europe\u2019s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, has criticised Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs, telling reporters (in Brussels, I think) that they are \u201cvery unfortunate\u201d. She also disputed Trump\u2019s claim earlier this year that trade wars are \u2018good and easy to win\u2019 (if you\u2019re running a big trade deficit) The FT\u2019s Jim Brunsden has the details: This escalation is very unfortunate\u201d, Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU\u2019s trade commissioner, told reporters. \u201cTrade wars are not good and they are not easy to win\u201d.... \u201cWe agree with some of the criticism the US has advanced vis-\u00e0-vis China\u201d, Ms Malmstrom said. \u201cBut we disagree with the methods the US is using\u2019. Companies are starting to scramble to protect themselves from trade war damage, says Chris Towner, director at JCRA, a financial risk management consultancy. He reports: We are certainly seeing an increase in firms looking to review their foreign exchange exposures and put together hedging strategies to help them cope with the volatility. In reaction to the trade disputes and follow-up actions, we have seen the Chinese yuan weaken by almost 10% against the US dollar, since the outset of this year. This will act as a buffer for Chinese exporters dealing in the international markets. In other words, a weaker yuan makes Chinese imports more competitive in US markets. Not what Donald Trump is aiming for.... Asian stock markets ended the day on a strong note, despite the latest trade war escalation. China\u2019s stock market gained almost 2%, Japan rose by 1.8%, and Hong Kong shrugged off its earlier losses to close 0.5% higher. Shares have also risen in Europe with morning, with the FTSE 100 gaining 0.2% and Germany up 0.3%. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says traders have shrugged off trade tensions: The renewed appetite for risky assets suggests that investors are getting tired of this situation and are paying less and less attention to Donald Trump\u2019s tweets and public comments. Analyst at ABN Amro suggest that a 10% tariff might not chuck too much sand in the wheels of global trade: Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has already impacted on 2.5% of world trade, says Timme Spakman, economist at Dutch bank ING. And it could get worse, if the White House follows through on its threats to impose even more tariffs on China. Spakman predicts that the trade war will intensify, writing: As President Trump pulled the trigger on 10% additional tariffs on imports from China last night, the percentage of world trade affected by it all just went up to 2.5%. If the US acts on further tariff threats, this could go up to 4% The new measures will cover USD 200bn worth of US imports from China, including jet engines, electronics, and fish. These tariffs, which were announced in June, are a reaction to the tariffs imposed by China in August, which in themselves were retaliatory measures. Given that, China\u2019s ministry of commerce has already pledged it will \u2018guard its interests\u2019 and has announced retaliatory tariffs earlier in the year, we don\u2019t expect a deal anytime soon and instead expect further elevation in 2019. We expect the US to impose further tariffs on the remaining imports from China (worth $267bn) and China to retaliate further. Newsflash: Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has warned that the US-China trade war could rumble on for decades. Speaking at a conference for Alibaba investors in Shanghai, Ma warned that the dispute would be \u201ca mess\u201d for all parties, and could last for 20 years. The full list of Chinese products that will hit with an extra 10% tariff next week (rising to 25% eventually) is online here. Nearly 200 pages long, the list covers almost 6,000 individual items. Some are quite dull, such as coal, printing ink, pneumatic tires and spark plugs. Others are more exotic, from live eels and frogs legs to rail locomotives and chandeliers. But some products have been removed, following public consultation, including devices that receive and transmit voice data. That\u2019s good news for Apple, as CNBC explains: Apple\u2019s smart watch, wireless headphones, and smart speaker will not be affected by the Trump administration\u2019s latest tariffs on Chinese imports, according to a list of affected products listed on Monday. Some Apple products, including its MacMini, will still be affected. Reuters points out that some consumer safety products made in China, such as bicycle helmets sold by Vista Outdoor and baby car seats and playpens from Graco Inc also were taken off the list. Importantly, rare earth minerals have also been dropped from the provisional list. They\u2019re used in a wide range of consumer electronics products, so an extra tariff could have hurt US manufacturers. More here. Bloomberg has estimated that the trade war will knock around half a percentage point off China\u2019s growth rate this year. The impact could rise to almost one percentage point, though, once these latest tariffs rise from 10% to 25% in 2019. China\u2019s economy is growing at around 6.5% per year, so it could absorb such a hit. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management has a good take on the US tariffs: US President Trump announced a staggered increase in US consumer taxes. A 10% tax on goods partially made in China now, a 25% tax after the year-end orgy of consumer spending. It will take some months for the tax to work down supply chains. The burden of this tax will likely hit lower income US consumers. Trump threatened to tax all imports partially made in China if China retaliates. China will probably retaliate. The nuclear option of China selling US Treasuries is not likely at this stage. However, China might fail to appear at a US bond auction or two, to remind the US that the balance of payments is a two-way flow. The tax will slow US growth. Raising taxes normally does slow growth. How soon growth is hit will depend on inventory levels, and the speed with which the tax is passed down supply chains. There may be a fear about \u201cwho is next?\u201d. Once additional tariffs against China are imposed, there is nothing else about China to tweet. Something else will have to fill the Trump Twitter Feed. Reminder: China can\u2019t simply retaliate by slapping a 10% tariff on $200bn of US goods, because it only buys around $130bn of stuff from America each year. And it already has new tariffs on \u00a350bn-worth of those imports, meaning Beijing only has $80bn of firepower left. Beijing isn\u2019t out of options, though. It could impose a higher tariff on US goods. Or it could announce curbs on US companies operating in China. But either step risks provoking another response from the White House. There\u2019s a flurry of activity in Beijing right now. The foreign ministry is giving a briefing on trade, and accusing the US of not being sincere. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang is telling reporters that America\u2019s \u2018unilateral\u2019 trade actions can\u2019t be accepted. The only solution is to hold talks on an equal footing, Geng says. Geng also confirms that China will respond, but doesn\u2019t outline what these countermeasures might be. Newsflash: China has announced it will retaliate against America\u2019s new tariffs....without saying how. The Chinese commerce ministry says it has no choice but to respond to the new 10% tariff on thousands of goods entering the US. And more in sorrow than in anger, the ministry adds that it hopes the US realises the negative consequences of its actions, and corrects its behaviour. America\u2019s Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), which represents major tech firms, was quick to criticise these new tariffs. ITI president Dean Garfield said Trump\u2019s decision was \u201creckless\u201d , and would hurt US communities: China must change, but this is not the way to achieve the needed market access in China. More tariffs not only punish American consumers, manufacturers, and businesses of all sizes, they will also diminish the opportunity to negotiate with the Chinese and address longstanding trade issues. If implemented, these tariffs will have both short- and long-term effects on the United States \u2013 from increased prices at the checkout counter to decreased leadership on the emerging technologies that will shape our future.\u201d The US Retail Industry Leaders Association also gave the tariffs the thumbs down. It warned they would dive up the cost of more than $1bn worth of gas grills from China, $843m worth of luggage and travel bags, $825m worth of mattresses, and $1.9bn of vacuum cleaners. Elsa Lignos of RBC Capital Markets believes Americans will soon feel the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs in the shops: Market reaction was muted as the tariffs had been widely telegraphed (and some cling to hope that the delay of 25% tariffs until January will mean more time for negotiation and reconciliation post midterms \u2013 an idea we think is unlikely). We have now reached a level of affected imports where it will necessarily start to impact consumer prices. The oil price, which is often a good barometer for growth prospects, has dipped since the US tariffs were announced. Brent crude has fallen to $77.78 per barrel, down 0.35% today. Wang Xiao, head of crude research at Guotai Junan Futures, blamed the US-China trade war: The growing trade dispute has hurt trading sentiment. The impact on economic growth is slowly dripping in, which again hurts oil prices,\u201d Somewhat surprisingly, China\u2019s stock market has actually risen since Donald Trump escalated the trade war. The benchmark Shanghai composite index has jumped by 1.7% today, having slumped to a four-year low on Monday. There is speculation that Beijing could boost its stimulus programme to support the economy through the trade war, which could boost corporate profits. Traders are also relieved that these new tariffs will start at 10%, not at the 25% level floated by Trump recently. And frankly, they may simply be pleased that the uncertainty is over; these tariffs were first floated in July..... A senior Chinese regulator has accused Donald Trump of creating a toxic atmosphere that could undermine efforts to reach a trade pact. Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of China\u2019s securities regulator, also claimed that China wouldn\u2019t cave in to these latest tariffs. Speaking at the port city of Tianjin, Fang criticised Trump\u2019s negotiating strategy, saying: \u201cPresident Trump is a hard-hitting businessman, and he tries to put pressure on China so he can get concessions from our negotiations. I think that kind of tactic is not going to work with China.\u201d Fang added he hopes the two sides can sit down and talk, but warned that the latest U.S. move has \u201cpoisoned\u201d the atmosphere, Reuters reports. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The trade war between America and China has escalated, fuelling fears that the global economy could be dragged down. Overnight, president Donald Trump announced a new 10% tariff of $200bn on Chinese goods arriving in the US from next week. It will rise to 25% at the end of the year. It\u2019s the latest move in Trump\u2019s push against \u201cunfair\u201d trade policies, which economists fear will prove counterproductive. Trump hit out at China last night as he announced the move, saying: \u201cFor months, we have urged China to change these unfair practices, and give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies. We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.\u201d And in a typical Trumpian flourish, he added: \u201cI urge China\u2019s leaders to take swift action to end their country\u2019s unfair trade practices. Hopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection.\u201d Thousands of Chinese products will now be more expensive in America, from fish, meat and vegetables to chemicals, furniture, metals and electric goods. This will cut demand for these products (hurting the Chinese economy), and also probably drive up prices in US shops (hurting Americans). The move will disappoint the City, where traders had been clinging to hopes of a peace deal. Instead, we are now awaiting China\u2019s retaliation. Trump\u2019s move means that America will now have tariffs on roughly half of its imports from China (which totalled over $500bn last year). China only imports around $130bn from America, meaning it can\u2019t simply announce a tit-for-tat retaliation. According to Bloomberg, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will hold a meeting in Beijing on Tuesday morning to discuss the government\u2019s response. China could decide to pull out of planned trade talks in Washington next week, if it feels Trump isn\u2019t showing sufficient goodwill.

It will rise to 25% at the end of the year.</p> <p>It\u2019s the latest move in Trump\u2019s push against \u201cunfair\u201d trade policies, which economists fear will prove counterproductive.<br></p> <p>Trump hit out at China last night as he announced the move, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFor months, we have urged China to change these unfair practices, and give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies. We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly.<br></p> <p>But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And in a typical Trumpian flourish, he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cI urge China\u2019s leaders to take swift action to end their country\u2019s unfair trade practices.

China only imports around $130bn from America, meaning it can\u2019t simply announce a tit-for-tat retaliation.</p> <p>According to Bloomberg, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will hold a meeting in Beijing on Tuesday morning to discuss the government\u2019s response.

      "bodyText": "Ferrari has announced a new open-top supercar it describes as \u201cprobably the closest and purest driving experience to Formula 1\u201d \u2013 and has already pre-sold the whole production run, despite a likely \u00a31m-plus price tag. At a private event for devoted customers at its headquarters in Maranello, Italy, the company said it would produce fewer than 500 of the 810hp Monza models, which can reach 62mph in 2.9 seconds. Nicolo Boari, Ferrari\u2019s head of product marketing, said the Monza would be \u201cthe most powerful ever in Ferrari history\u201d, with an 810 horsepower engine. He added that the open-cockpit would make the cars \u201cprobably the closest and purest driving experience to the Formula 1\u201d. The cars, which will come in one-seat or two-seat versions, are part of the new chief executive\u2019s plans to boost profits by introducing models particularly very expensive limited-edition supercars. The latest models are the first in a limited series called Icona, which reference Ferrari\u2019s racing cars of the 1950s. Louis Camilleri, who took over as Ferrari chief executive from Sergio Marchionne, who died in July, said the company planned to launch an unprecedented 15 new models. Among them will be Ferrari\u2019s first sports utility vehicles (SUVs) called Purosangue \u2013 Italian for thoroughbred. It follows in the footsteps of luxury competitors such as Lamborghini and Aston Martin. Camilleri said he has set a target of doubling profits to \u20ac2bn by 2022. He aims to increase sales to \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.4bn) by 2022, up from \u20ac3.4bn last year. He said it was an \u201cambitious\u201d target but the firm was confident it would be able to lift sales as the number of super-wealthy people around the world keeps growing. The global population of ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) people, those with more than $30m (\u00a323m) in assets, increased by 12.9% last year to a record 255,810 people. All of the Monzas have already been pre-sold to customers who attended the preview party on Monday night. The company said it would reveal pricing of the new cars at the Paris Autoshow in October, but experts said they are likely to sell for more than \u00a31m each. Ferrari\u2019s limited-edition LaFerrari Aperta convertible model costs $2.1m (\u00a31.6m). Buyers of the Monzas will receive a racing jumpsuit by high-end Italian luxury brand Loro Piana. Luxury leather goods company Berluti will specially produce Monza driving shoes and a leather-clad helmet.",

      "bodyText": "BMW plans to shut its Mini plant for a month after the UK\u2019s official departure from the European Union, to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts. The German carmaker said it was bringing forward annual maintenance work at the site in Cowley, Oxford \u2013 which turns out 1,000 Minis a day \u2013 to coincide with the weeks immediately following the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. The contingency plan is designed to limit any disruption to its production because any blockages in the cross-Channel supply of parts would occur while it is updating and replacing equipment, not while it is manufacturing cars. BMW\u2019s decision is the latest in a string of Brexit-related interventions by carmakers, which employ 186,000 people directly in the UK and tens of thousands more in the supply chain. Ealier on Tuesday, Honda said a no-deal Brexit would cost it \u201ctens of millions\u201d, while Jaguar Land Rover has moved 2,000 staff at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week until Christmas, citing Brexit uncertainty and sliding sales of diesel-powered cars. \u201cPlanned annual maintenance periods at BMW Group production sites allow essential updating and equipment replacement to be completed over several weeks, while there is no production taking place. \u201cAs a responsible organisation, we have scheduled next year\u2019s annual maintenance period at Mini Plant Oxford to start on 1 April, when the UK exits the EU, to minimise the risk of any possible short-term parts supply disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cWhile we believe this worst-case scenario is an unlikely outcome, we have to plan for it. \u201cWe remain committed to our operations in Britain, which is the only country in the world where we manufacture for all three of our automotive brands.\u201d Several Brexiters, including former Brexit minister David Davis, have claimed that carmakers such as BMW would lobby the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to ensure the EU agreed to a deal that suits Britain. In February 2016, Davis said: \u201cWithin minutes of a vote for Brexit the CEOs of Mercedes, BMW, VW and Audi will be knocking down Chancellor Merkel\u2019s door demanding that there be no barriers to German access to the British market.\u201d But BMW and other automotive firms have been among the most vocal sectors in British industry about the pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit, underlining the risk posed by any customs delays to the \u201cjust in time\u201d production techniques used by carmakers. BMW warned earlier this year that it could be forced to shut some of its four UK plants, putting 8,000 jobs at risk, if parts for the Minis and Rolls-Royces it makes in Britain are caught up in customs delays. Honda said earlier on Tuesday that a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds in additional tariffs and would damage its competitiveness. Like BMW, the Japanese carmaker said it was committed to its UK factory, in Swindon. The chief executive of the automotive trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, warned this year that auto firms were not ready for this scenario, with the official exit date of 29 March 2019 looming. Asked if there were any potential Brexit benefits for the British automotive industry, which has a combined annual turnover of \u00a382bn, Mike Hawes said: \u201cNot that we can see.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "China hits back at US with $60bn of new tariffs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China is to slap tariffs on an additional $60bn (\u00a346bn) of imports from the US in retaliation against $200bn of new trade sanctions on Chinese goods announced by Donald Trump. The latest moves represent a new step towards a full-scale trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. Further escalation is deemed likely because Trump is facing low approval ratings ahead of the US midterm elections in November, while China will not want to be seen to back down. Trump announced his latest escalation of the bitter trade standoff late on Monday, promising to introduce the additional border taxes of 10% on Chinese goods from next week. The tariffs \u2013 designed to make US domestic products more competitive against foreign imports \u2013 apply to almost 6,000 items, including consumer goods such as luggage and electronics, housewares and food. The US president threatened further tariffs on an additional $276bn of goods if Beijing unveils retaliatory measures \u2013 a step that would mean tariffs on all Chinese imports to the US and equate to 4% of world trade. Early on Tuesday he tweeted to accuse China of \u201cactively trying to impact and change our election by attacking our farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me\u201d. The US president added: \u201cWhat China does not understand is that these people are great patriots and fully understand that China has been taking advantage of the United States on trade for many years. \u201cThey also know that I am the one that knows how to stop it. There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!\u201d However, China then unveiled $60bn of tariffs on US imports including aircraft and coffee. Ahead of China\u2019s latest move, Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba and one of the country\u2019s wealthiest men, warned the conflict could drag on for 20 years and would be a \u201cmess\u201d for all parties. China faces difficulty in responding on a scale equal to Trump\u2019s new tariffs because its annual imports from the US total only about $130bn, while its exports to the US total more than $500bn. However, analysts said the Chinese government had a comprehensive toolbox of alternative measures it could deploy to disrupt US businesses operating in China \u2013 and might even devalue its currency to offset the impact of the tariffs. Erik Britton of research firm Fathom Consulting said he believed China was eventually likely to capitulate and would enter fresh talks to end the threat of tariffs as a result of the trade imbalance. \u201cOur likeliest outcome is that China yields. They\u2019ve been in a game of chicken \u2013 only the US is driving a 40-tonne truck and China is driving a Fiat Cinquecento.\u201d Britton added that Trump was probably using the threat of tariffs to force Beijing to change its economic policies covering US companies. \u201cThe point is they [the US] want something to change,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I threaten my kids with stopping their pocket money it\u2019s not that I want to raise money. It\u2019s that I want them to tidy their room.\u201d Trump has argued Beijing uses \u201cunfair\u201d trade practices such as forcing the transfer of US firms\u2019 intellectual property when they operate in China. Some analysts, however, said the threat of tariffs could exacerbate these actions, rather than end them. David Chmiel, the managing director of risk consultancy Global Torchlight, said: \u201cThere could be a weaponising of regulation by Beijing. You can see a situation where they target specific US companies.\u201d Economists said this could have a significant impact as many US companies \u2013 including Nike, General Electric and Apple \u2013 have operations in China. Disruption could range from invasive health and safety checks to tougher labour controls or rules on fire standards. Mergers and acquisitions could be made more difficult, and state contracts could be withheld from US firms. Keith Wade, the chief economist at Schroders, said: \u201cVery zealous enforcement of regulations could make life quite difficult for companies. America is also probably more dependent on China than the official trade figures suggest.\u201d US Census Bureau figures show China sells about $375bn more to the US than goes the other way. However, Deutsche Bank reckons taking into account direct in-country sales by US firms in China would give a $20bn surplus in favour of the US.",

There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!\u201d</p> <p>However, China then unveiled $60bn of tariffs on US imports including aircraft and coffee.</p> <p>Ahead of China\u2019s latest move, Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/alibaba\">Alibaba</a> and one of the country\u2019s wealthiest men, warned the conflict could drag on for 20 years and would be a \u201cmess\u201d for all parties.</p> <p>China faces difficulty in responding on a scale equal to Trump\u2019s new tariffs because its <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html\">annual imports from the US</a> total only about $130bn, while its exports to the US total more than $500bn.</p> <p>However, analysts said the Chinese government had a comprehensive toolbox of alternative measures it could deploy to disrupt US businesses operating in China \u2013 and might even devalue its currency to offset the impact of the tariffs.</p> <p>Erik Britton of research firm Fathom Consulting said he believed China was eventually likely to capitulate and would enter fresh talks to end the threat of tariffs as a result of the trade imbalance.</p> <p>\u201cOur likeliest outcome is that China yields. They\u2019ve been in a game of chicken \u2013 only the US is driving a 40-tonne truck and China is driving a Fiat Cinquecento.\u201d </p> <p>Britton added that Trump was probably using the threat of tariffs to force Beijing to change its economic policies covering US companies.</p> <p>\u201cThe point is they [the US] want something to change,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I threaten my kids with stopping their pocket money it\u2019s not that I want to raise money. It\u2019s that I want them to tidy their room.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has argued Beijing uses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/07/trump-trade-war-china-us-products\">\u201cunfair\u201d trade practices</a> such as forcing the transfer of US firms\u2019 intellectual property when they operate in China.

      "bodyText": "Brussels has launched an anti-trust investigation into whether BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche, known as the \u201ccircle of five\u201d, colluded to limit the development of clean emission technology. The German car manufacturers are suspected of agreeing not to compete against each other in the roll-out of anti-pollution systems for petrol and diesel passenger cars. \u201cThese technologies aim at making passenger cars less damaging to the environment,\u201d the European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement. \u201cIf proven, this collusion may have denied consumers the opportunity to buy less-polluting cars, despite the technology being available to the manufacturers.\u201d If found guilty the manufacturers could face multibillion-pound fines for anti-competitive behaviour. An anti-trust judgment can result in sanctions of up to 10% of global revenues on a product. The launch of the European commission\u2019s formal investigation follows a report in the German magazine Der Spiegel in July last year, which claimed the car companies had held secret meetings since the 1990s to collude on technology. Authorities raided the offices of BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany in October. The commission\u2019s announcement comes three years to the day since the revelation that Volkswagen installed software in millions of its diesel vehicles around the world to cheat emissions tests. The technology at the centre of the investigation relates to selective catalytic reduction systems, which can reduce harmful nitrogen oxide emissions from passenger cars with diesel engines, and \u201cOtto\u201d particulate filters, which reduce harmful emissions from passenger cars with petrol engines. The commission said it had evidence of discussions among carmakers relating to the development of their models, although the current investigation is restricted to looking into attempts to limit competition in clean emission technology. In their meetings, the companies discussed common quality requirements for car parts and common quality testing procedures. They also had discussions on the maximum speed at which the roofs of convertible cars can open or close, and at which speed the cruise control would work. Cooperation was said to have also included crash tests and crash test dummies, where the carmakers pooled expertise to improve testing procedures for car safety. Daimler told AFP the company had put itself forward as whistleblower in the case, a special status that if accepted would allow for leniency. BMW vowed that \u201cits full commitment to the principles of free market and fair competition\u201d, saying the group is itself investigating the charges. The VW group, which owns Audi and Porsche, said the opening of the investigation was only a \u201cprocedural step\u201d. Greg Archer, a spokesman for the European environmental lobby group, Transport &amp; Environment, said: \u201cOn the third anniversary of Dieselgate, this new investigation into collusion between German carmakers ... is a timely reminder that German car industry puts profits above people and the law.\u201d AFP contributed to this article",

      "bodyText": "Honda has warned a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds in additional tariffs and would damage its competitiveness, but the Japanese carmaker said it was committed to its factory in Swindon. Ian Howells, the European boss of Honda, said its costs could rise by about 10% if the UK fails to strike a deal with the EU and World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs are applied instead. Honda employs about 3,500 people at its plant in Swindon, where the Honda Civic and the CR-V are built. It keeps only an hour\u2019s-worth of parts and relies on deliveries from about 350 trucks every day to provide the parts required to make the cars on a \u201cjust in time\u201d basis. Howells said that as well as meaning higher tariffs, a no-deal Brexit would cost Honda in terms of additional bureaucracy and damage productivity. \u201cFrom an administrative point of view, we\u2019d probably be looking at 60,000-odd additional bits of documentation we\u2019d have to provide to get product to and from Europe,\u201d he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \u201cIf we end up with WTO tariffs, we\u2019d have something like 10% of costs in addition on products shipped back into Europe and that would certainly run into tens of millions. And likewise, when we\u2019re looking at components coming the other way, again tens of millions in tariffs potentially coming into the UK. \u201cThat impacts our productivity, certainly in terms of the flow of product, but also it does hit potentially our competitiveness. Of course if we are shipping and competing against a European manufacturer in Europe, they\u2019re not incurring those tariffs.\u201d Howells added that despite the potentially negative impact a no-deal Brexit would have on Honda\u2019s UK operations, its Japanese owners have no plans to move production away from Swindon. \u201cThe UK forms part of our global network of manufacturing plants, so the only place we produce the vehicle we produce at Swindon is in Swindon itself. The logistics of moving a factory the size of Swindon would be huge and as far as we\u2019re concerned, we\u2019re right behind supporting continued production at Swindon,\u201d he said. The warning from Honda on the challenges posed by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit comes a day after Jaguar Land Rover \u2013 the largest manufacturer of cars in the UK \u2013 announced that about 2,000 staff will move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant. The company said it had taken the decision to reduce production at the West Midlands site as it grapples with difficult conditions in the car industry, caused by Brexit and the slump in sales of diesel-powered cars. Last week, Jaguar Land Rover warned \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of jobs could be lost in the sector if the government failed to reach an agreement with Brussels. The UK automotive industry has repeatedly called on Theresa May\u2019s government to prioritise the sector in its negotiations with the EU, arguing that car manufacturing in Britain risks \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d if multinationals choose to invest in countries other than the UK after Brexit. The average UK-built car has about 6,000 parts and the majority come from the EU. Parts can sometimes pass through four countries before reaching the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Last summer Tanya Harrell was working in McDonald\u2019s in Gretna, Louisiana, when she says a co-worker started making unwanted sexual advances. A colleague she occasionally gave lifts to started touching her inappropriately at work, grabbing her breasts and backside and asking her to touch his penis. \u201cI felt totally exposed, as if I did not have a skin or shell. I felt like I was outside my own body, watching what was happening,\u201d she said in a complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). When she complained Harrell said her managers did not take it seriously and suggested there was some kind of relationship between the two and she should take it to the \u201cnext level\u201d. She was told she was acting \u201clike a little girl\u201d and was childish to complain about it. After these incidents another co-worker took her into the men\u2019s bathroom, pinned her against a wall, exposed himself and tried to have sex with her. She burst into tears and was saved only when a manager called for the worker. Harrell never reported the incident because she said her previous complaints had fallen on deaf ears. On Tuesday Harrell and hundreds of other McDonald\u2019s workers will protest outside the fast-food giant\u2019s restaurants in 10 cities across the US, highlighting what they claim is an epidemic of sexual harassment for workers that they say the company has done little to address. Workers in Chicago, McDonald\u2019s home town, Durham, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Orlando, San Francisco and St Louis will all walk out at lunchtime in an effort to highlight their struggle and call on the company to take action. Bolstered by the success of the #MeToo movement, where high-profile women have decried sexual harassment in the workplace, they are hoping the strike will highlight the plight of women and LGBT workers in low-paid jobs who face similar issues on a daily basis but whose struggles rarely make the headlines. Harrell is one of 10 people who filed charges with the EEOC detailing widespread sexual harassment. They are being backed by the Fight for $15 low-wage group and the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, founded earlier this year to help provide lawyers for women who don\u2019t have the money to hire one. Adrianna Alvarez, who has worked for McDonald\u2019s in Chicago for nine years, says the problem is \u201cnationwide, worldwide\u201d. \u201cPeople are scared. They worry that if they complain it will affect their legal status, they could get fired or there could be retaliation,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen depend on these jobs.\u201d She said all the women she knows in fast food have examples or know of people who have been affected. One of her colleagues became so frightened after workplace abuse that she felt unable to use the bathroom. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t face passing the manager, to have to hold it in all day, that\u2019s abusive,\u201d said Alvarez. Annelise Orleck, professor of history at Dartmouth College and author of We Are All Fast-Food Workers, a history of the new labour movement growing among low-wage workers, said abuse of this kind in the fast-food industry was \u201cendemic\u201d. \u201cThere is a big movement of working-class women brewing. They are banking that in the age of #MeToo customers will not tolerate this kind of behavior.\u201d She pointed to victories by hotel workers in Chicago, where an ordinance now requires hotels to provide panic buttons to all workers who clean, restock, or take inventory alone in guest rooms and rest rooms. A similar ordinance is being discussed in California. Orleck said 66% of hotel workers say they have experienced sexual harassment; in fast food the figure is around 40%. In a statement McDonald\u2019s said: \u201cThere is no place for harassment or discrimination of any kind at McDonald\u2019s. Since our founding, we\u2019ve been committed to a culture that fosters the respectful treatment of everyone. We have policies, procedures and training in place that are specifically designed to prevent sexual harassment at our company and company-owned restaurants, and we firmly believe that our franchisees share this commitment.\u201d The company also said it was engaging third-party experts Rainn, an anti-sexual violence organisation, and Seyfarth Shaw at Work, an employment law training firm, to \u201cevolve our policies, procedures and training. We will continue \u2013 as we always have \u2013 to look at ways to do even more to ensure that McDonald\u2019s values are reflected in every restaurant, every day.\u201d But the legacy of abuse continues, workers say. Harrell says she is still dealing with the impact of her experience at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cI feel uncomfortable, afraid and upset,\u201d she said. \u201cManagers feel it\u2019s not their problem. They don\u2019t take it seriously,\u201d said Harrell.",

      "bodyText": "The federal government has ruled the Indian mining company Adani does not have to complete a full environmental impact statement for its application to drastically expand a dam and build a pipeline for its Carmichael coalmine. The project, which Adani calls the north Galilee water scheme, would involve the construction of a 10 billion-litre dam. An existing dam has a capacity of 2.2bn litres. Adani also wants to build 110km of pipeline to transport water from the Suttor river and Burdekin basin. The Department of the Environment and Energy has decided the application will require assessment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act before it can proceed. However, the department decided not to apply the \u201cwater trigger\u201d, a component of the act that mandates coalmining and coal seam gas projects that have significant impact on water resources must undergo more rigorous national environmental assessment. \u201cThe project will be assessed by preliminary documentation,\u201d a formal notice of decision says. In its application, Adani said it did not believe an environmental impact statement was needed because assessments had been done under previous applications for other parts of the mining project. Adani argued the water trigger applied only to projects associated with extraction. It said the pipeline was a piece of associated infrastructure and a separate project that therefore did not trigger assessment for impacts on water. In its application, Adani also said there was potential for its dam and pipeline to supply water for other coalmining projects in the Galilee basin, such as the China Stone coal project. The Australian Conservation Foundation said the decision amounted to \u201celected representatives giving preferential treatment to Adani, and highlighted weaknesses in Australian environmental laws. \u201cAs one of the driest continents on earth, water is the lifeblood of inland Australia,\u201d ACF campaigner Christian Slattery said. \u201cIt is disappointing that while Queensland suffers through severe drought, the water infrastructure for Adani\u2019s massive polluting coalmine will avoid full scrutiny under Australia\u2019s national environment laws.\u201d",
