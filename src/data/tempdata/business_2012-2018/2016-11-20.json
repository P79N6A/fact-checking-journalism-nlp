      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has admitted that the federal budget may not return to balance by 2020-21 as planned. He told ABC radio that the government would release its mid-year budget update on 19 December with an updated projection for the likely date for a return to surplus. Deloitte Access Economics released its latest Budget Monitor on Monday, warning the federal budget deficit was projected to expand by another $24.3bn over the next four years. It said Australia\u2019s record low wages growth and a shortfall in company tax were likely to blow a hole in the income tax take, dashing the government\u2019s hopes of returning the budget to surplus in 2020-21, and raising the spectre of credit ratings downgrade. When asked about Deloitte\u2019s report, Morrison said he had always been \u201cvery careful\u201d when talking about the likelihood of returning the budget to surplus. He said the government\u2019s 2020-21 date was a projection based on the best available numbers in the May budget. \u201cWhat I said was that the projection based on the parameters at the time was that the budget would return to balance in 2020-21,\u201d he told ABC host Michael Brissenden. \u201cNow I\u2019ve always been very careful about that \u2026 I know others in the past have made bold predictions and promises about these things. \u201cThe 2020-21 budget balance position was a projection based on those numbers. Now these numbers move, they always have.\u201d Brissenden asked Morrison: \u201cSo if the numbers aren\u2019t there you won\u2019t get to that [surplus] position [by 2020-21]?\u201d Morrison replied: \u201cWell that\u2019s simple arithmetic. But no one has made that call yet, and no one\u2019s suggesting that yet.\u201d He also repeated his argument that Australia had an \u201cearnings problem\u201d, with wages growing at a record slow pace, company profits down, much lower terms of trade, and lower commodity prices, so the government had to keep cutting spending. When he first became treasurer last year, Morrison had said Australia had \u201ca spending problem, not a revenue problem,\u201d but he changed his mind in August this year, admitting the country did have an \u201cearnings problem\u201d. \u201cOur nominal growth today is lower than our real growth, by a full percentage point,\u201d he told the Bloomberg Economic Summit in Sydney in August. \u201cThis is an uncommon predicament and a core challenge in working to bring the budget back to balance.\u201d After Labor\u2019s 2012 budget, the then shadow treasurer, Joe Hockey, told the National Press Club that a future Abbott government would generate many surpluses. \u201cBased on the numbers presented last Tuesday night we will achieve a surplus in our first year in office and we will achieve a surplus for every year of our first term,\u201d Hockey had said. In early 2015, after a huge fall in commodity prices, and struggling to get large savings measures through the Senate, Hockey told the Coalition party room that the budget may \u201cnever get back to surplus.\u201d Hockey left the Treasurer\u2019s portfolio without delivering a surplus, like Labor treasurer Wayne Swan before him.",

      "bodyText": "The federal budget deficit is projected to expand by another $24.3bn over the next four years, as Australia\u2019s record-low wages growth and a shortfall in company tax blow a hole in the income tax take. It means the Turnbull government\u2019s hopes of returning the budget to balance in 2020-21 have become even slimmer, raising the spectre of a major credit ratings downgrade. Deloitte Access Economics\u2019s latest Budget Monitor, released on Monday, shows the commonwealth government\u2019s fortunes are tied uncomfortably to rising global commodity prices and the unlikely prospect of the return of inflation. It shows the recent rise in global commodity prices, particularly the price of coal, will not be enough to stop the deficit expanding by billions. Chris Richardson, Deloitte director, said when making his budget calculations he also assumed, generously, that the Senate passes all savings measures by mid-2017, that state governments accept the Turnbull government\u2019s savings measures that have been made at their expense, and that Australia\u2019s economy finally reflates. He said the 2016-17 budget assumed the nation\u2019s finances would repair themselves over coming years thanks to a projected doubling of the pace of nominal GDP growth, which is very unlikely when the world is stuck with \u201clowflation\u201d. He said these assumptions were unrealistic, so the projected budget deficit could end up being even larger than his predicted $24.3bn blowout by 2019-20. \u201cThat speaks to the underlying vulnerability of official budget forecasts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey assume the next four years are a turnaround versus the last four: so they depend on a lot of things going right.\u201d The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, and the shadow minister for finance, Jim Chalmers, have jumped on the news, saying yet another budget deterioration will jeopardise Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating. \u201cWith the ratings agencies already expressing concern about the budget position, any further blowout of this nature will put our hard-earned AAA credit rating at even more danger of being lost,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cAlready Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison have delivered a budget deficit for 2015-16 eight times bigger than they inherited, the 2016-17 deficit has tripled and net debt for this year has blown out by more than $100bn on their watch. \u201cIt is time for this government to take responsibility for the state of the books and stop pointing the finger at everyone else for their failings.\u201d But Morrison said Labor\u2019s approach to budget repair could not be taken seriously. \u201cAny claims made by Labor about risks to the AAA credit rating need to recognise that Labor\u2019s approach at the last election was to worsen the budget deficit over the forward estimates and increase taxes that would slow economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cLabor\u2019s resort to cynical populism is also no panacea to repairing the budget. It should make the right decisions to support the government\u2019s savings measures and contribute to the national interest. \u201cThe goal of our national economic plan outlined in the budget is to lift what Australians are earning from their wages and their businesses, not tax them more, as Labor propose to do. That is why our enterprise tax plan is so important. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect businesses to earn and invest in providing more hours of work per week for their employees when you are demanding that they keep paying higher taxes,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Exhausted delivery drivers could pose a road safety risk over the next few weeks as thousands of staff are urged to work up to 20 days in a row to cope with the rush of online orders around Black Friday. Government safety inspectors have been called on to investigate the possible danger from delivery drivers who work six days a week and have been asked if they are also willing to work Sundays. Labour MP Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, asked the Health and Safety Executive to investigate after Hermes, which delivers parcels for retailers including John Lewis and Next, made the request to about 5,000 couriers. If they agree, some could work 20 days without a break starting from Monday. Black Friday is on 25 November. Field asked the HSE \u201cto ensure the company\u2019s actions do not put the safety of its couriers as well as road users at risk\u201d and warned of \u201ca risk of tiredness ... towards the end of the 20-day stretch\u201d. The HSE said it was considering his request. Hermes said Sunday work is \u201ccompletely optional\u201d, but some couriers said they felt under pressure to agree and warned that exhaustion could cause them to fall asleep at the wheel or drive dangerously. Delivery drivers are being pushed more than ever to get parcels out to homes as the UK shapes up for the discount shopping day, which is set to have the most online sales of any Black Friday to date. Britons are expected to spend \u00a32.9bn over the four days from Friday 25 November, 38% more than on Black Friday weekend last year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the majority of additional transactions will be made online. Online retail association IMRG is predicting a 12% increase in the volume of parcels going through the online system compared with 2015, with the vast majority of those delivered to homes rather than bought in stores. Meanwhile, the number of visitors to Britain\u2019s high streets is expected to fall by nearly 5% and shopping centres are set for a 3.7% drop, according to analysts at Springboard. Only retail parks will see additional visitors, it said, with numbers predicted to be up by 1.7% over the weekend as shoppers pick up items they have bought online. One courier in the north-west said he almost fell asleep at his steering wheel when he worked non-stop for three weeks during last year\u2019s Black Friday rush. \u201cIt is dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cOne Friday, after I\u2019d worked two Sundays, I pretty much fell asleep and had to pull over. I have said to my field manager that I don\u2019t want to [do it again] because it is dangerous and the reply I got was \u2018you need to find cover or you might end up losing a round\u2019. I can\u2019t afford to lose a round ... We end up in a position where we almost aren\u2019t given the option to say no.\u201d Hermes is expecting to deliver 750,000 parcels on the Sunday after Black Friday. It is offering a \u00a340 bonus for couriers who work Sunday 27 November and Sunday 4 December to help cope with \u201cunprecedented volumes\u201d. One Hermes courier in the east Midlands, who already works six days a week, said: \u201cThey are requiring us, if we can\u2019t get cover, to do the Sundays because they threaten to take our rounds off us. I am very concerned about safety. \u201cSome of us work at night before we do our jobs for Hermes and a lot of us are shattered. We are making mistakes and we aren\u2019t putting our seatbelts on because we are jumping in and out of the car all the time, or we forget to put the handbrake on.\u201d In a statement, Hermes said: \u201cThe average courier round takes up to six hours. As a result, we do not believe that if couriers choose to work on those Sundays there will be any safety risks. \u201cAny threats made to couriers by field managers suggesting work may be removed if they do not work or find cover are completely unacceptable, and not in line with our policies and company code of conduct. If any field manager is found to have made threats of this nature, we will act swiftly and accordingly.\u201d Mark Cartwright, the head of vans at the Freight Transport Association, said: \u201cThe delivery industries must ensure their drivers and vehicles are safe and roadworthy. \u201cThe pressure to perform increases greatly at this time of the year with Black Friday and the Christmas peak, but that can never be an excuse to cut corners on standards by unrealistically increasing the number of parcels a driver is expected to deliver, or by the use of unregulated seasonal and casual staff.\u201d DPD, another delivery company that uses self-employed drivers and delivery personnel on Sundays, said some drivers worked six days a week for the peak six-week period leading up to Christmas, but they could choose which hours they worked. Up to two-thirds of drivers worked on a Sunday over the period, but their hours were within the legal limit and would be very light on other days, such as Fridays, when fewer parcels were delivered, the company said. Courier company Yodel said: \u201cSome Sunday delivery has been planned as contingency. If this is required, it is on a completely voluntary basis.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers, already struggling with the economic uncertainty and volatile currency movements caused by the Brexit vote, face a \u00a32.3bn tax hike next April, heightening fears that they will have to raise prices for consumers. The amount retailers pay in business rates \u2013 a tax on their shops and warehouses \u2013 will surge by \u00a3465.8m a year on average for the next five years, a total of more than \u00a32.3bn over that period, new research shows. The tax increase highlights the pressure on retailers in the run-up to the autumn statement on Wednesday and has led to calls for Philip Hammond, the chancellor, to step in. As well as the rise in business rates, retailers are tackling a slump in sterling \u2013 which has made importing goods more expensive \u2013 and the national living wage, which means every employee over the age of 25 must be paid at least \u00a37.20 an hour. Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, has warned that retailers face a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d as costs rise while profits across the sector decline. The price of some household goods such as Marmite has increased in some shops since Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that retailers will eventually pass on the rise in their costs to consumers. Business rates have become controversial in the retail industry and have been blamed for the malaise on Britain\u2019s high street. The tax is based on the value of commercial property and the annual rate of inflation, but retailers claim it takes no account of financial performance and they are overly burdened by the levy because they rely so heavily on property. Most high street retailers pay more in business rates than they do in corporation tax and claim it hands an unfair advantage to online-only retailers such as Amazon, because they control far less property. The tax brought in \u00a327.8bn for the Treasury last year, making it the sixth biggest source of income. The new increase facing retailers is due to a revaluation of Britain\u2019s property. The country\u2019s commercial property is supposed to be revalued by the Valuation Office Agency every five years, but the government controversially delayed the last revaluation by two years, claiming it would create uncertainty among businesses. This will accentuate the changes that will come into force from April. An analysis by Paul Turner-Mitchell, a business rates expert, and the property agent CVS has found that the business rates for 485,435 retail premises in England, which account for more than a quarter of all properties liable for rates, will rise from \u00a37.7bn a year to \u00a38.2bn over the next five years. Mark Rigby, the chief executive of CVS, said: \u201cThe retail sector is facing a significant shift in structural dynamics, with most reporting challenging conditions ahead. \u201cAdd to the mix the already \u2018lethal cocktail\u2019 of increased operating costs from the national living wage and apprenticeship levy, and a near half a billion pounds increase in business rates per year for the next five years is simply unsustainable. \u201cSomething will have to give \u2013 whether that\u2019s store closures or even higher prices at the till.\u201d Separately, business leaders from eight trade bodies have condemned government plans to clamp down on business rates appeals, claiming it could cost small and medium-sized companies more than \u00a3700m over the next five years. A proposed new provision in the business rates system means businesses will only be able to challenge their rates bill if the margin of error is larger than 15%. The Valuation Office Agency faces a backlog of tens of thousands of business rates appeals. The proposals could help to cut the backlog. Martin McTague, policy director at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \u201cWe welcomed the government\u2019s ambition to make the business rates appeals system fairer and easier to navigate. However, it is hard to see how this proposal helps to achieve that aim. \u201cWe believe this clause simply fails the fairness test and could result in the door being shut on small businesses who want to correct inaccuracies in valuations and reduce their rates bills. This research shows that businesses that are already struggling could be pushed into insolvency, with smaller firms particularly at risk.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s independent economic watchdog will tear up its previous forecasts for the UK\u2019s growth prospects as it gives its first official verdict on the outlook for post-Brexit Britain this week. The Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to paint a gloomy picture of lower growth, higher inflation and a larger-than-expected deficit as the UK negotiates its way out of the EU. The new forecasts will form a central part of Philip Hammond\u2019s maiden autumn statement on Wednesday, as the chancellor seeks to provide support for the economy against a more challenging backdrop. Growth forecasts at the time of the budget in March \u2013 two months before the shock referendum outcome \u2013 will be revised down for 2017 from 2.2% to between 1.25% and 1.5% according to the forecasting group EY Item Club. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting UK growth of just 1.1% next year, which would be the lowest rate of annual growth since 2009 when the economy shrank by 4.3% in the depths of the financial crisis. The OBR is also expected to say that consumer prices will rise at a faster rate than it was expecting back in March, as the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote pushes import prices up and feeds through to the high street. Economists expect the OBR to revise up its forecasts for inflation in 2017 from 1.6% to closer to 3%. Meanwhile, the watchdog will revise up its forecasts for government borrowing, possibly by as much as \u00a3100bn over the next five years, as weaker growth weighs on tax receipts. Hammond has already said he will abandon the plans of his predecessor, George Osborne, to return the public finances to surplus by 2019-20. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cIn the eight months since the budget the entire fiscal landscape has changed. The OBR faces a challenge in cutting through the post-referendum fog to produce a clear outlook for the UK economy.\u201d The more downbeat assessment from the OBR will follow an unexpected show of resilience from the UK economy in the months immediately after the referendum, as consumers appeared to shrug off any uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. The Office for National Statistics is expected to confirm the economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter when it publishes its second estimate of gross domestic product on Friday. It was a stronger-than-expected performance, and ruled out the possibility of a recession in the second half of 2016. The IMF believes the UK will be the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial countries in 2016, with growth of 1.8%.",

The OBR faces a challenge in cutting through the post-referendum fog to produce a clear outlook for the UK economy.\u201d </p> <p>The more downbeat assessment from the OBR will follow an unexpected show of resilience from the UK economy in the months immediately after the referendum, as consumers appeared to shrug off any uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. </p> <p>The Office for National Statistics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/uk-economy-shrugs-off-brexit-uncertainty-with-05-growth\">is expected to confirm the economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter</a> when it publishes its second estimate of gross domestic product on Friday. It was a stronger-than-expected performance, and ruled out the possibility of a recession in the second half of 2016.</p> <p>The IMF believes the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/04/britain-fastest-growing-g7-economy-imf-international-monetary-fund-brexit-vote\">will be the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial countries</a> in 2016, with growth of 1.8%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British guitar buyers could soon be playing the Brexit blues as price rises caused by the slump in the value of the pound feed through to music stores. Prices are increasing by double digits as top US brands such as Gibson and Fender increase list prices to make up for the weaker purchasing power of sterling. Anthony Macari, co-owner of Macari\u2019s on London\u2019s Denmark Street, said: \u201cWe are seeing increases of 10-15%, not just on American guitars but on guitars coming in from Europe and China. Everyone is catching up.\u201d He said increases were noticeable because guitar prices have barely risen in recent years. The full effect will be felt after Christmas, he said. The list price of the standard US model of Macari\u2019s top-seller, the Gibson Les Paul, will increase by about 10% to \u00a32,299 for 2017. At Regent Sounds on the other side of Denmark Street, owner Crispin Weir said he had changed his prices three times since the vote for Brexit. He said prices of Fender guitars had gone up by about 20% and for other items the increase was more. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen prices increase right across the board and they are continuing to rise. Some things are going to go up by 40%. I always feared this would happen.\u201d The pound has lost almost a fifth of its value against the dollar since the referendum on 23 June. Sterling has also tumbled against the euro and the Chinese yuan, pushing up prices of budget models made in China. Macari and Weir said there was a short-term benefit to the pound\u2019s plunge. Macari said customers were snapping up existing stock and Weir said European tourists were taking advantage of the euro\u2019s strength to buy instruments. Macari\u2019s effects pedals, which it makes in London, have also become cheaper for US buyers. British guitarists may have little option but to pay the extra because there is no domestic maker to compare with the cachet and history of the US brands. Macari said: \u201cIf it\u2019s not made in Nashville, it\u2019s not a Gibson.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to Jamland. Formerly known as the United Kingdom, Jamland is where the Jams live. They were once known as the squeezed middle. They have also been dubbed the people who just get on with it. Now, courtesy of Theresa May, there is a new moniker for those who are struggling to get by \u2013 the families who are \u201cjust about managing\u201d. The prime minister minted the phrase that has become Whitehall\u2019s favourite new acronym in her speech outside Downing Street on the day she got the job. She pledged to strive for a country that worked for everyone, empathising with those in precarious jobs, struggling to pay the mortgage, worried about the cost of living or anxious about getting their children into a good school. Politicians have known about the Jams and vied for their allegiance for years. Ed Miliband made a pitch for the \u201csqueezed middle\u201d and George Osborne donned a hard hit and a hi-vis jacket to praise and rub shoulders with those who uncomplainingly \u201cgot on with it\u201d. Philip Hammond, who has the responsibility of making good on the prime minister\u2019s promises, explained who the Jams were on his visit to Andrew Marr\u2019s sofa to talk about Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement. \u201cThey are the people who work hard and don\u2019t feel they are sharing in the prosperity that economic growth is bringing to the country,\u201d the chancellor said. Or, to put it more concisely, the ones who voted for Brexit. The referendum was a seminal moment, because the Jams turned out in their millions to vote for leave. Their living standards are lower than they were in the mid 2000s. Twenty years ago, a just managing family was twice as likely to own their own home as to rent. Today the reverse it true. Two-thirds of children in poverty live in homes where at least one adult is working. On 23 June, the Jams were on one side, the Darts \u2013 doing all right thanks \u2013 were on the other. The Jams live in a country that is just about managing. Courtesy of record-low interest rates, the Bank of England is just about managing to keep the economy going. Despite repeatedly missing its targets, the government is just about managing to convince the financial markets that the public finances are under control. Exports of services mean the UK is just about managing to disguise the fact that there has been a deficit in manufactured goods every year since 1982. The NHS is just about managing to cope with increased patient demand and the toughest run of financial settlements since it was founded in 1948. Fair play to the government. It has identified all the right problems. There are, indeed, far too many just about managing households. The reason is that Jamland is a country that invests too little, where productivity is poor and where Osborne\u2019s promised rebalancing of the economy towards manufacturing and exports simply has not happened. Jamland specialises in creating low-skill, low-pay, insecure jobs. May and her team have talked about the need for an industrial strategy, of the desirability of having workers and consumer representatives on company boards, of a budgetary \u201cre-set\u201d that will soften austerity and \u2013 most notably \u2013 of helping those who are just about managing. So far it has been just that. Talk. Wednesday, however, is when the talking stops. Hammond has the task both of bringing some short-term relief to the Jams while at the same time tackling the deep-seated problems of the economy so there are fewer Jams in the future. That is not going to be easy. For one thing, there are a lot of Jams out there spread thickly across the country. The Resolution Foundation estimates that there are 6 million working-age households on low to middle incomes concentrated in areas as diverse as Pendle in Lancashire, Sandwell in the West Midlands and North Devon. And there\u2019s more. Money is tight and will remain so. The government\u2019s target date for balancing the books continues to be pushed back. Hammond has abandoned Osborne\u2019s plan to run a budget surplus by the end of the current parliament and will announce on Wednesday that there will still be a chunky deficit in 2020. The economy has performed much more strongly since the EU referendum than many feared, but the deficit in the current financial year is still likely to be at least \u00a310bn to \u00a315bn higher than the \u00a355bn Osborne pencilled at his 2016 budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which compiles the government\u2019s economic and fiscal forecasts, will say on Wednesday that the uncertainty Brexit is causing will put additional strain on the public finances. Osborne\u2019s plan to run a budget surplus required big cuts in the welfare budget. One way of saving money was to freeze working-age benefits such as tax credits for the duration of the parliament, which meant their value would be eroded by inflation. The fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote means inflation is now going to be higher than expected, with the Bank of England predicting it will hit 3% by early 2018. The Jams rely on tax credits to top up their wages, so they could do with some help from the chancellor. He gave little indication, however, on the Marr show that he had much to offer. Noting that the economy was likely to slow next year, he talked about the \u201ceye-watering level of debt\u201d, the need to maintain \u201ccredibility\u201d and his desire to make the economy \u201cmatch fit\u201d for the challenges and the opportunities ahead. The challenges were highlighted last week by the left-leaning IPPR thinktank, which announced a two-year commission designed to come up with solutions to Britain\u2019s structural economic weaknesses. Six were identified \u2013 under-investment, a chronic trade deficit, poor public finances, too many Jams, the concentration of income and wealth in the south-east, and the failure to hit carbon reduction targets. \u201cBrexit forces us to face up to the diagnosis,\u201d the IPPR said. \u201cWe have an economy that is not delivering what it should for the British people. The paradox of the Brexit vote \u2013 a mandate for change that may make change harder to achieve \u2013 requires a far-reaching response.\u201d It has taken decades for Britain to become Jamland. A cash-strapped Hammond is not going to come up with all the answers. Freezes to fuel duties, more generous childcare subsidies and money for road improvements represent tinkering rather than a fundamental shift in policy. What does that mean? It means the scope for disappointment is high. The prime minister may wake up on Thursday morning to find herself portrayed as the White Queen in Alice through the looking glass \u2013 offering jam tomorrow but never jam today.",

The price cuts took petrol down to 110.7p a litre, and diesel to 112.7p. Fuel prices have risen in the months after the Brexit vote prompted a sharp drop in the value of the pound.

The attempt to deter reporting of the case will be challenged by a number of news outlets \u2013 including the Guardian \u2013 and comes as the SFO continues its investigation into Barclays\u2019 emergency cash call during the 2008 banking crisis. The unfair dismissal case is being brought by Richard Boath, who until March was chairman of financial services at Barclays and has been interviewed by the SFO as part of its long-running investigation. Few details about his claim are known although he is reported to be making the case under whistleblower protection laws. This means the potential payout is unlimited, unlike the \u00a378,000 cap that applies to tribunals. The SFO said it was \u201cseeking orders that the hearings be held in private so as to preserve the confidentiality of the claimant\u2019s interview by the SFO, and that there should be corresponding restrictions on the publication of such matters\u201d. It added that an alternative would be \u201cfor the parties not [to] be permitted to refer to the contents of the claimant\u2019s interview by the SFO in these proceedings\u201d. The SFO has said it will decide by March 2017 whether to bring charges in connection to the events in 2008 when Barclays avoided a taxpayer bailout by raising \u00a37bn from investors, including in the Middle East.

The FCA penalty has been put on hold while the SFO continues its investigation, which Barclays has previously said includes its ex-finance director Chris Lucas. Barclays has said it disclosed this fee arrangement in the first fundraising in June 2008, but not in the following one in October 2008. The SFO had raised the possibility last year of offering Barclays a deferred prosecution agreement, which would require cooperation from companies that in turn need to admit to offences, although this appears to have come to nothing. Barclays declined to comment ahead of the tribunal. It is contesting a \u00a3721m claim by Amanda Staveley \u2013 a financier who helped the bank find billions of pounds during 2008 \u2013 who argues she should have received fees for being involved in the the crucial financings.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The federal government could shrink its budget deficit by a billion dollars a year by cracking down on unduly generous tax breaks for over 65s, says the Grattan Institute. Its new report, Age of Entitlement: Age-based Tax Breaks, shows the proportion of over 65s who pay income tax in Australia has halved in the past 20 years. It says three age-based tax breaks for seniors have contributed to the large reduction in their income tax and ought to be wound back. The report says its proposed changes would have little effect on the 40% of seniors who receive a full age pension. They would most affect seniors who are wealthy enough to receive no pension or just a part-pension, it says. The three tax breaks are: the seniors and pensioners tax offset (Sapto), a higher Medicare levy income threshold, and higher private health insurance rebates available only to older Australians. Sapto is a tax offset that reduces the personal income tax paid by senior Australians. Its maximum value in 2016-17 is $2,230 for a single person or $1,602 for each member of a couple, the report says. It is available to people who have reached the current pension age of 65, whether or not they qualify for the age pension. The Grattan Institute says it should be wound back so that it is available only to pensioners. The institute also says the Medicare levy income threshold ought to be reduced for seniors so that only pensioners with income under $27,000 (for singles) or $42,000 (for couples) pay no Medicare levy. At the moment, seniors earning up to $33,738 (singles) or $46,966 (couples) pay no Medicare levy. The Grattan Institute says pensioners earning more than these thresholds should pay Medicare levy at the current rate of 10 cents for every additional $1 earned until equal to 2% of taxable income. These changes would reduce the maximum value of the higher Medicare levy threshold from $675 to $540 for singles and from$470 to $420 for each member of a couple. The Grattan Institute also says higher private health insurance rebate rates for seniors should be reduced to the same levels as apply to younger workers with similar incomes. It says winding back Sapto and the Medicare levy income threshold would save about $700m a year. Reducing the private health insurance rebate so that seniors got the same rebate as younger Australians would save about $250m a year. John Daley, the director of the Grattan Institute, said the three tax breaks were difficult to justify. \u201cSome argue that the tax breaks are a fair reward for paying tax while under 65,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in fact, large tax breaks for seniors are a relatively new invention not provided to previous generations. The current generation of seniors receives much more than its predecessors from government spending, particularly on health. \u201cAge-based tax breaks are badly designed to achieve valid policy purposes, such as increasing workforce participation or preserving adequate retirement incomes for poorer Australians. \u201cThey might have been affordable when they were introduced over the past 20 years but the country can no longer afford the bill,\u201d he said. The report shows how numerous policy changes over the last 20 years have led to a situation where older Australians are paying far less income tax than their predecessors. It says in 1995, before special tax offsets were introduced for senior Australians, roughly 27% of seniors paid income tax. After the introduction of the low-income aged persons rebate in 1996 and then the senior Australians tax offset (a precursor to Sapto) in 2000, only 15% of seniors paid income tax. In 2007, the abolition of taxes on superannuation withdrawals further reduced the proportion of seniors paying income tax. The effects of these changes were compounded by large general income tax cuts in the mid-2000s and by the global financial crisis. As a result, just 13% of seniors paid personal income tax in 2009-10, the report says. Then the proportion of seniors paying income tax rose slightly to 16% in 2013-14 as financial markets recovered, and bracket creep increased the number of people of all ages paying tax. \u201cThe increase of budgetary transfers \u2013 more benefits and lower taxes \u2013 to senior households might have been justified if those households had been facing increased financial pressures,\u201d the report says. \u201cBut in fact, these transfers came just as older households were capturing an increased share of the nation\u2019s resources. \u201cOver the 10 years to 2013-14, average household wealth grew by 32%. Older households captured most of this growth while younger households\u2019 wealth stagnated. \u201cDespite the global financial crisis, households aged between 65 and 74 years today are $400,000 (or 47%) wealthier in real terms than households of that age 10 years ago. \u201cBy contrast, households aged 25 to 34 years are no more wealthy than the equivalent households a decade before.\u201d",

The effects of these changes were compounded by large general income tax cuts in the mid-2000s and by the global financial crisis. </p> <p>As a result, just 13% of seniors paid personal income tax in 2009-10, the report says.</p> <p>Then the proportion of seniors paying income tax rose slightly to 16% in 2013-14 as financial markets recovered, and bracket creep increased the number of people of all ages paying tax.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/17/market-failure-private-health-insurance-only-worth-it-for-the-pregnant-the-rich-and-the-sick\">Market failure: private health insurance only worth it for 'the pregnant, the rich and the sick'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe increase of budgetary transfers \u2013 more benefits and lower taxes \u2013 to senior households might have been justified if those households had been facing increased financial pressures,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>\u201cBut in fact, these transfers came just as older households were capturing an increased share of the nation\u2019s resources.</p> <p>\u201cOver the 10 years to 2013-14, average household wealth grew by 32%.

      "bodyText": "A boost for childcare in the autumn statement would be a profoundly depressing move. And it will be just as dispiriting if there are new programmes to help low-income families. Not because these measures aren\u2019t to be warmly welcomed: it is just that it will tell you that the chancellor is focused on tinkering rather than boldly tackling the most pressing crisis of the age: housing. Last week saw several heavyweight reports into Britain\u2019s housing crisis. The Redfern review, detailing the catastrophic slump in home ownership, told us how real house prices have jumped 151% since 1996, while real earnings have risen only about a quarter as much. The report by the ResPublica thinktank, out the next day, told us how 1.2 million people are languishing on housing waiting lists in England, while more than 6 million face tenure insecurity and no prospect of ever buying their own home. Meanwhile the Lyons Housing Commission reminded us last week how, after decades of failure to build the homes the country needs, public concern about housing is the highest it has been for 40 years. Not that today\u2019s millennials need researchers to tell them about punishingly high rents, one-bed flats costing seven times income, and deposits on new homes that take nearly a lifetime to save. The difference now is that the grown-ups accept that action is urgent \u2013 not least because they\u2019re approaching retirement and the kids have still not left home. The problem with housing is that to make a real impact, the sums of money required are truly colossal. Britain\u2019s housing stock is worth \u00a36 trillion. A billion or two, sprinkled here and there on HomeBuy (2005), Open Market HomeBuy (2006), First Buy (2011) and Help to Buy (2013) has been a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. During the lifetime of these schemes, fewer and fewer young adults and families have been able to buy. It takes tens of billions to actually make a difference. The standard refrain is that we don\u2019t have tens of billions. Cranking up building to the 200,000 units a year most experts say we need as a minimum remains a dream; we don\u2019t have the money, the land or the workers to build them. Yet in 1951 politicians \u2013 from the Conservative party, no less \u2013 set out a plan to build 300,000 units a year, at a time of much greater austerity, and when the national debt was 200% of GDP compared with 89% now. Harold Macmillan, the wartime minister of supply, was charged with hitting the 300,000 target. Among his requests was for \u201c2,000 million bricks\u201d. Oddly, the Redfern review last week suggested that boosting housing supply will do little to help first-time buyers, and that house prices will remain out of reach. This is unduly pessimistic; a history of British house prices tells you how they remained flat through much of the 1950s and early 1960s, precisely when supply was at its most vigorous \u2013 around 400,000 units a year at its peak. We knocked out just 140,000 last year. Finance is cheaper than the 1950s, with even Brexit failing to disrupt the government\u2019s ability to borrow at historically low levels of interest. The money markets are awash with investors happy to accept returns of 1% or 2% a year; housing associations and local authorities are desperate to build both private and public housing. We urgently need to break this logjam, and if not now, then when? Never has there been such near-universal acceptance of the need to act. But while funding is the most important issue, it\u2019s far from the only one: what do we do about planning permission, the green belt, new towns, developers\u2019 land banks, inefficient building methods, minimum space standards and reviving the small and medium-sized housebuilding sector? And the type of housing we build is as important as the volume. Crucially, we need a vision. What we\u2019ll find out this week is whether Hammond has inherited the one-nation instincts of Macmillan, or the dreary austerity of Osborne. Central bankers fight the brickbats Janet Yellen is going nowhere. She will serve out her full term as chair of the US Federal Reserve. At least that is what she said in her first remarks since the upset that handed the US presidency to Donald Trump \u2013 a man who was openly critical of the Fed on the campaign trail and said he would replace Yellen when her term expired. But Yellen made it clear she would not be cowed into an early exit \u2013 and she also stood firm on the Fed\u2019s intentions to raise US interest rates soon, to reflect an improving jobs market and rising inflation. This is the latest showing of central banker defiance in the face of political meddling. In the UK, policymakers at the supposedly independent Bank of England have been defending their role after prime minister Theresa May broke with protocol and talked about \u201cbad side-effects\u201d from low interest rates and quantitative easing. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, seemed unimpressed, commenting days later: \u201cWe are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side.\u201d Downing Street apologised, insisting that May had not intended to attack the governor. But her comments prompted open criticism of Threadneedle Street and Carney from senior Tories and sparked a debate over the Canadian\u2019s future at the Bank. Last week it was deputy governor Ben Broadbent\u2019s turn to fight the Bank\u2019s corner, as he argued that low rates had not driven up inequality. It\u2019s a similar story in the eurozone. Amid nervousness over the rise of anti-establishment movements, the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, has been forced to fend off accusations that it is partly to blame. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said rock-bottom interest rates were hurting savers and fuelling rightwing nationalism. It has been open season on central bankers and experts in general this year. But if and when Yellen is forced to remind President Trump that central bank independence is not a matter for debate, she will be in good company. Asda needs more than price cuts Walmart-owned Asda has just revealed its ninth consecutive quarter of declining sales as German discounters Aldi and Lidl eat its breakfast, lunch and dinner. Asda\u2019s new boss, Sean Clarke, insists the grocer\u2019s fortunes are on the turn as carefully targeted price cuts and a decision to put more staff in stores begins to bring back shoppers. Year-on-year sales are now down \u201conly\u201d 5.8%, rather than the 7.5% of three months ago. Tesco has shown it is possible to win back customers by sorting out the basics \u2013 like better service and lower prices on everyday items from bread to apples. But Tesco has always traded on broad appeal. Asda\u2019s historical focus on price gives it a much harder job. It is already the cheapest of the major grocers, but is the worst performing by a large margin. It needs to be smarter and more inventive, and put some excitement back in its stores. It needs bigger ideas than just price cuts.",

We knocked out just <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/547818/House_Building_Release_June_Qtr_2016.pdf\" title=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/547818/House_Building_Release_June_Qtr_2016.pdf\">140,000 last year</a>.</p> <p>Finance is cheaper than the 1950s, with even Brexit failing to disrupt the government\u2019s ability to borrow at historically low levels of interest. The money markets are awash with investors happy to accept returns of 1% or 2% a year; housing associations and local authorities are desperate to build both private and public housing. We urgently need to break this logjam, and if not now, then when? Never has there been such near-universal acceptance of the need to act.</p> <p>But while funding is the most important issue, it\u2019s far from the only one: what do we do about planning permission, the green belt, new towns, developers\u2019 land banks, inefficient building methods, minimum space standards and reviving the small and medium-sized housebuilding sector? And the type of housing we build is as important as the volume.</p> <p>Crucially, we need a vision. What we\u2019ll find out this week is whether Hammond has inherited the one-nation instincts of Macmillan, or the dreary austerity of Osborne.</p> <h2>Central bankers fight the brickbats</h2> <p>Janet Yellen is going nowhere. She will serve out her full term as chair of the US Federal Reserve. At least that is what she said in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/17/federal-reserve-interest-rate-hike-december\" title=\"\">her first remarks since the upset that handed the US presidency to Donald Trump</a> \u2013 a man who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/trump-us-federal-reserve-false-economy-interest-rates\" title=\"\">openly critical of the Fed on the campaign trail</a> and said he would replace Yellen when her term expired.</p> <p>But Yellen made it clear she would not be cowed into an early exit \u2013 and she also stood firm on the Fed\u2019s intentions to raise US interest rates soon, to reflect an improving jobs market and rising inflation.</p> <p>This is the latest showing of central banker defiance in the face of political meddling. In the UK, policymakers at the supposedly independent Bank of England have been defending their role after prime minister Theresa May broke with protocol and talked about \u201cbad side-effects\u201d from low interest rates and quantitative easing. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, seemed unimpressed, commenting days later: \u201cWe are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street apologised, insisting that May had not intended to attack the governor. But her comments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/mark-carney-michael-gove-criticism-thought-crime-bank-england\" title=\"\">prompted open criticism</a> of Threadneedle Street and Carney from senior Tories and sparked a debate over the Canadian\u2019s future at the Bank.</p> <p>Last week it was deputy governor Ben Broadbent\u2019s turn to fight the Bank\u2019s corner, as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/18/low-interest-rates-inequality-bank-of-england-ben-broadbent\" title=\"\">argued that low rates had not driven up inequality</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a similar story in the eurozone. Amid nervousness over the rise of anti-establishment movements, the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, has been forced to fend off accusations that it is partly to blame. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said rock-bottom interest rates were hurting savers and fuelling rightwing nationalism.</p> <p>It has been open season on central bankers and experts in general this year. But if and when Yellen is forced to remind President Trump that central bank independence is not a matter for debate, she will be in good company.</p> <h2>Asda needs more than price cuts</h2> <p>Walmart-owned Asda has just revealed its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/17/asda-sales-slump-bottom-uk-supermarket-league\" title=\"\">ninth consecutive quarter of declining sales</a> as German discounters Aldi and Lidl eat its breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p> <p>Asda\u2019s new boss, Sean Clarke, insists the grocer\u2019s fortunes are on the turn as carefully targeted price cuts and a decision to put more staff in stores begins to bring back shoppers. Year-on-year sales are now down \u201conly\u201d 5.8%, rather than the 7.5% of three months ago.</p> <p>Tesco has shown it is possible to win back customers by sorting out the basics \u2013 like better service and lower prices on everyday items from bread to apples.</p> <p>But Tesco has always traded on broad appeal. Asda\u2019s historical focus on price gives it a much harder job. It is already the cheapest of the major grocers, but is the worst performing by a large margin. It needs to be smarter and more inventive, and put some excitement back in its stores. It needs bigger ideas than just price cuts.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest business organisation will make an urgent plea to Theresa May this week to come forward with clearer plans for Brexit to avoid further crippling uncertainty and serious damage to the economy. In a speech on Monday to its annual conference, the president of the Confederation of British Industry, Paul Drechsler, will insist that the UK must retain its \u201cprivileged\u201d access to the EU single market, keep its borders open to European talent, and agree lengthy transitional arrangements with the EU, to stop businesses falling of a \u201ccliff edge\u201d on the day the UK leaves. The warning, before Philip Hammond\u2019s first autumn statement , is a sign of growing frustration among business leaders at the government\u2019s refusal to spell out its intentions on the UK\u2019s involvement with the single market and customs union. May and Hammond say they cannot give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d or reveal their negotiating hand before talks begin with the EU once article 50 is triggered, which they \u201cremain committed to ... by the end of March next year\u201d. It will also be seen as a cry for help, amid signs that EU leaders are increasingly resigned to delivering a \u201chard Brexit\u201d for the UK \u2013 which will mean leaving the single market \u2013 because May and her ministers refuse to compromise over EU rules on free movement. There is also alarm among CBI members at perceived anti-business rhetoric and policy ideas emanating from No 10, such as plans to put workers on company boards. In his speech, Drechsler will say that businesses are completely committed to making the best of Brexit. But he will make clear that there will be untold damage unless access is retained to the single market as part of a \u201csmooth Brexit\u201d process. In particular, he will emphasise the need for a period of transition after 2019, during which the UK remains tied into the single market and its rules, in order to avoid a sudden change and the imposition of tariffs, probably under World Trade Organisation rules. Dreschsler will welcome a decision on triggering article 50 and other moves, such as approving expansion of Heathrow airport. But he will add: \u201cWhen it comes to negotiations, no one understands the need for discretion better than business. We\u2019re not asking for a running commentary \u2013 but we are looking for clarity and, above all, a plan. \u201cIn other areas uncertainty remains. Business needs to know we won\u2019t close our borders to Europe\u2019s talent, or lose our privileged access to Europe\u2019s markets. And there\u2019s another important question: what happens on the day after Brexit, when the clock strikes midnight, and our two years\u2019 negotiating time is up? Today, businesses are inevitably considering the cliff-edge scenario \u2013 a sudden and overnight transformation in trading conditions.\u201d However, Professor Tim Congdon, a former Treasury adviser and Ukip candidate, said MPs were right to push for leaving the single market to grab the opportunity of trading more freely with the rest of the world. Disputing claims that the manufacturing and agricultural industries could be wiped out by cheap imports once outside the single market, Congdon said: \u201cThere is no reason why manufacturing cannot flourish outside the EU, though there is likely to be a different pattern of manufacturing. \u201cSingapore is the clearest example of a free market economy and it has a larger manufacturing industry as a proportion of the economy than the UK does.\u201d The hard-hitting intervention from Dreschsler came as it emerged that the government was warned in a report it commissioned in 2013 that the cost of leaving the Customs Union would be crippling for businesses. The economic \u201cthink-net\u201d the Centre for Economic Policy Research, in a submission to the government\u2019s balance of competences review, calculated that the cost of complying with new rules for trade would range from 4% to 15% of the cost of goods sold. Open Britain, a pro-European campaign organisation that includes Remain group politicians, has calculated this would amount to a cost of \u00a312.7bn for exporting businesses. Outside the Customs Union, UK exporters would face additional costs from Rules of Origin rules, which compel exporters to determine where a product originated. The common external tariff that operates in the EU means goods from outside can travel freely within the union once that tariff has been paid. A mobile phone currently imported into the UK from China can be re-exported to the rest of the EU without having to pay any more tariffs. This is not true for goods that enter the EU via the EEA or via other countries with which the EU has a free or preferential trading relationship, because they do not share the EU\u2019s common external tariff. Anna Soubry MP, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign, said: \u201cBrexit is supposed to herald a bonfire of bureaucracy, but leaving the Customs Union would leave British firms mired in expensive additional red tape. \u201cThe government\u2019s own figures suggest a multibillion-pound bombshell for British businesses. Before slapping them with that kind of bill, we need concrete evidence that leaving the customs union will make Britain better off.\u201d",
