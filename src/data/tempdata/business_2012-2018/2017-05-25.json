      "bodyText": "A group of \u201cdiehard\u201d shareholders determined to see the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Fred Goodwin in court are refusing to accept a settlement in their \u00a3700m legal claim against the bank. The state-backed lender has offered about \u00a3200m, or 82p per share held by investors, in an attempt to avoid a case that would see Goodwin take the stand on either 8 or 9 June. About 4,500 current and former employees, some of whom are seeking a higher offer, are understood to be among those who have not accepted a deal. Shareholder Neil Mitchell, who has previously sued RBS in a separate claim, said there was a hardcore group that would not settle under any circumstances. \u201cFor many people, it\u2019s never been about money, it\u2019s been about principle and justice, and about seeing senior board members of the bank brought to trial,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of pensioners [among the claimants], many of whom are ex-RBS employees. \u201cWhen they went to presentations by Goodwin, they weren\u2019t just encouraged to put their bonus in, but to put their savings in, even to go and borrow money. \u201cThat\u2019s why some people are diehards. But there are also financial institutions that feel the same way, that this should go to trial.\u201d Mitchell said the public deserve to hear more about what led to the bank\u2019s \u00a345bn taxpayer-funded bailout after it nearly collapsed in 2008. The case was brought by 9,000 claimants who allege that they were misled into investing in a \u00a312bn rights issue as the bank was close to collapse. Reports that thousands of claimants are refusing to settle cast doubt on comments by Jonathan Nash QC, acting for the claimants, who told Mr Justice Hildyard that \u201cprogress continues to be made\u201d on a settlement. RBS has reached settlements with 87% of the investors after announcing in December that it had an \u00a3800m pot to resolve claims. Hildyard has adjourned the case until 7 June. The court is not sitting next week, but has set a deadline of 1 June to know whether a settlement is possible.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s major oil producers have voted to continue their production cuts into 2018 in an attempt to prop up the oil price. Under the deal reached by Opec and 11 non-members, including Russia, output cuts of 1.8m barrels a day will be extended for a further nine months. However, the deal failed to impress the market and the oil price started to slide even as the details of the agreement were being hammered out. The price of Brent Crude fell almost 4% to $51.90. It has mostly hovered in the $50-55 range since the original six-month cuts began in January. While the result was expected, it quashed hopes in some quarters that the Vienna meeting would yield even deeper cuts, which the cartel deemed unnecessary. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital said: \u201cOpec members had a chance today but bottled it. A nine-month extension just isn\u2019t enough to really lift oil prices as we\u2019ll continue to see US shale fill the gap. Having said they\u2019d do whatever it takes, Opec is looking a bit toothless now.\u201d Saudi Arabia said the group could have dealt with the oil supply glut by the end of 2017, but was playing it safe. \u201cWe would do it in six months but then we\u2019d have a seasonal build [of supply] in the first quarter [of 2018] which could undo what we\u2019ve done \u2013 so we went for the safe bet of extending to nine months,\u201d said Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister. Delegates at the meeting described Russia as a \u201clynchpin\u201d in winning non-Opec members over. While the agreement has only stabilised the oil price in the short-term, experts hailed it as an important deal. \u201cOpec\u2019s decision is a big one because it shows a commitment to support oil prices into 2018 \u2013 and potentially for all of next year,\u201d said Ann-Louise Hittle of Wood Mackenzie. The oil analysis group said that without an extension, prices would have collapsed next year to an annual average of $43 a barrel. Maintaining the cuts would likely set a floor price in the low $50s this year, said Deloitte, which believes the cartel made the right decision in extending rather than deepening curbs. \u201cDeeper cuts would have likely weakened the incentive for high compliance across Opec while encouraging non-Opec producers to accelerate production growth,\u201d said Andrew Slaughter of the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions. Saudi Arabia rejected the claim that the group\u2019s efforts to stabilise the oil price would be hampered by US oil production rising off the back of the Opec deal. \u201cShale is an important variable but we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to significantly derail or affect what we\u2019re doing. The market is big enough to absorb the expected increased production in shale in 2017,\u201d said Falih. However, observers said that Opec\u2019s ability to shore up prices by curtailing output was constrained by the speed and volume with which US oil production could ramp up. Jason Bordoff, founding Director at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, said: \u201cTo the extent Opec cuts production and props up prices, some of those gains are lost to more rapid growth in shale oil, which is very sensitive to changes in price at the levels we are currently seeing.\u201d Some Opec delegates said they did not believe forecasts by the US government, which expect US production up 1m barrels a day year-on-year by December \u2013 a level that would offset more than half the cuts of the \u201cVienna group\u201d. But Bordoff said the forecast did not seem unreasonable. \u201cRecent experience with shale suggests that Opec countries should underestimate shale at their peril,\u201d he warned. The original Opec deal last year has already spurred the US oil industry to return rigs to work at a ferocious rate. Baker Hughes puts the number of rigs at 901 now, up from 404 at the same time last year \u2013 and the production from many of those rigs has yet to come through. At the Vienna meeting Opec also accepted Equatorial Guinea as its 14th member.",

      "bodyText": "European stock markets have lagged behind their US counterparts. While New York\u2019s S&amp;P 500 hit another record high, most continental bourses ended the day in the red. The FTSE 100 finished a little higher, though, partly due the pound weakening after this morning\u2019s poor GDP figures. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: UK and European markets have essentially traded in a sideways fashion for most of the week, and today is no exception. While US markets clock up new highs Europe remains becalmed, despite the fact that European data has been much stronger of late than its US counterpart. Across the Atlantic, Amazon and Google find themselves locked in a race for $1000; tech firms continue to leave the old economy far behind, with momentum continuing to drive the sector higher. In a bull market, you buy the strongest performing assets \u2013 with the Nasdaq 100 nearly a fifth higher year-to-date, it is clear that momentum lies here, leaving the staid S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 100 far behind. And that\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Another former Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, has rushed to visit Lucas Papademos in hospital. Eurocrisis followers may remember that Papandreou was succeeded by Papademos, when his administration was replaced by a government of national unity in late 2011 after seeking its second bailout. The current governor of the Bank of Greece, Yannis Stournaras, is visiting his predecessor in hospital now. Stournaras told reporters that the letter bomb attack on Lucas Papademos was \u201ccowardly\u201d, the Kathimerini newspaper reports. The 4% plunge in the oil price tonight shows that Opec hasn\u2019t done enough to curb crude stockpiles. Nizam Hamid, ETF Strategist in Europe at wealth manager WisdomTree, says: \u201cOpec\u2019s long-awaited meeting has disappointed investors, with oil prices giving up recent gains after members dashed expectations of deeper cuts to production and merely reiterated the status quo. \u201cThe falls may provide a buying opportunity for investors who believe in the long-term story for oil, but they also highlight the environment of heightened volatility which the commodity is facing. \u201cWith supply side dynamics undergoing a fundamental shift thanks to the impact of US shale, only decisive action from Opec will boost prices from current levels, and so far investors have not been satisfied that Opec is tackling the issue aggressively enough.\u201d It\u2019s good news for countries who import oil, of course. Car drivers might not see such sharp price rises at the forecourt.... Greek TV are reporting that Lucas Papademos\u2019s injuries are not life-threatening, following this afternoon\u2019s explosion. The ex-PM has been taken to a hospital in Athens. The oil selloff is accelerating -- Brent crude is now down almost 4.5% at $51.60 per barrel. That shows that the markets aren\u2019t impressed by the plan to extend existing output cuts for another nine months. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says investors are disappointed that Opec didn\u2019t agree deeper production cuts: OPEC members had a chance today but bottled it. A nine-month extension just isn\u2019t enough to really lift oil prices as we\u2019ll continue to see US shale fill the gap. Having said they\u2019d do whatever it takes, OPEC is looking a bit toothless now. Instead of deepening cuts they are continuing to tinker at the margins by curbing production by around 1.8m barrels/day along with several non-OPEC members. It also looks like no new non-OPEC members are joining the curbs, which would have helped. Newsflash from Athens: There are reports that a bomb has gone off inside the car of former Greek prime minister Lucas Papademos. Greek police say that Papademos and his driver have both been injured, but we don\u2019t have any more details. One report says it was a letter bomb. Papademos, who was also Greek central bank chief and a ECB vice-president, was installed as interim PM in 2011 after Greece signed up for a \u20ac130bn bailout. Letter bombs have been sent to several senior figures from the eurozone crisis in recent months, including German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. One exploded at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s headquarters in Paris in March, injuring a member of staff. Oil prices are on the slide, following the news that Opec and non-Opec members have agreed to extend their production cuts until March 2018. Brent crude is down 2% at $52.82, while New York crude has dropped by 2.7%, below $50 per barrel. Traders may be concluding that the deal won\u2019t succeed in propping prices up, as US shale producers can boost their own output. Delegates are briefing reporters in Vienna that a nine-month extension has been agreed, by Opec and non-Opec members. That means oil producers will continue to cut 1.8 million barrels per day off their combined output. Energy reporters are racing around the Opec headquarter again, as the official announcement from oil cartel is imminent. Over in New York, the S&amp;P 500 has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The technology-focused Nasdaq is also hitting all-time record levels Traders aren\u2019t worried by the prospect that US interest rates will rise next month. Chris Beauchamp of IG says: Traders arrived at their desks this morning having seen the Fed minutes warn of overvaluations in asset prices, and hint at further policy tightening later in the year, and yet were confronted with new record highs in the S&amp;P 500 and the MSCI world index, while the US dollar is under pressure again. What an odd world we live in. Reuters are also reporting that Opec has agreed to curb supply levels for another months: OPEC decided on Thursday to extend cuts in oil output by nine months to March 2018, OPEC delegates said, as the producer group battles a global glut of crude after seeing prices halve and revenues drop sharply in the past three years. The cuts are likely to be shared again by a dozen non-members led by top oil producer Russia, which reduced output in tandem with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries from January. OPEC\u2019s cuts have helped to push oil back above $50 a barrel this year, giving a fiscal boost to producers, many of which rely heavily on energy revenues and have had to burn through foreign-currency reserves to plug holes in their budgets. Newsflash from Vienna: The Opec meeting has finished. The cartel are now being joined by non-Opec countries, to discuss whether they would also support today\u2019s rumoured deal to cut supplies for another nine months. Dutch bank ING don\u2019t think Opec\u2019s supply cuts will work, as America\u2019s shale industry (which won\u2019t be part of the deal) can boost its own production levels. The latest US trade data is a little disappointing. America\u2019s trade deficit has widened, to $67.5bn in April from $65.0bn. That\u2019s because exports shrank by 0.9%, with US firms selling fewer cars and consumer goods overseas. Imports rose by 0.7%. That suggests that America\u2019s economy may not be rebounding as strongly as hoped from its weak first quarter. But...the latest jobs data is more encouraging. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit rose by 1,000 last week, to 234,000. That\u2019s lower than the 237,000 which Wall Street had expected, and close to its lowest levels in decades. Back over in Vienna, Opec ministers have been hammering out an agreement to extend their existing production cuts. There\u2019s nothing official yet, but the word on the ground is that the cartel will keep its current supply cuts for another nine months, through to March 2018. That\u2019s what investors had largely expected.... ...so the markets have shown their contrary nature, by sending the oil price down a bit. Brent crude is now down 1% at $53.43 per barrel, a whole dollar per barrel less than this morning. That\u2019s partly due to our old friend \u2018buy the news, sell the rumour\u2019. But there\u2019s also some disappointment that Opec didn\u2019t agree deeper cuts. Instead, they\u2019re sticking to the 1.8m barrel a day deal first agreed in late November extended to March 2018. George Buckley, UK economist at Nomura, is concerned that Britain\u2019s growth rate is now lagging behind European rivals. He writes: This is the first time in a year that UK growth failed to outpace that of the euro area (on average over the past 3-4 years the UK has grown a couple of tenths per quarter more strongly than the euro area). While UK real GDP is broadly the same as that of Germany relative to where it was at the start of 2008, Germany has produced its 8.5% increase in aggregate output over that period with no change in its population, compared a 6% rise in UK headcount (though the UK has experienced a more sizable rise in its dependency ratio). On a per capita basis, UK GDP did not expand at all in the first quarter of this year (in separate figures also published today official net migration fell to its lowest in three years \u2013 248k in 2016). Housebuilding was a bright spot amidst the gloom spread by the unexpected downward revision to UK GDP today. The Department for Communities and Local Government said 43,170 new houses were started in England between January and March, up 3% on the previous quarter and up 21% on a year earlier. The number of completed houses rose to 39,520, 9% higher than the previous quarter and 21% higher than a year ago. Housing starts totalled 162,880 in the year to March, up 15% on the previous year, while completions rose 6% to 147,960. Andy Frankish of Mortgage Advice Bureau says more is needed: \u201cYes, the latest figures do indicate a marginal increase and we can see the signs of recovery starting in 2013, demonstrating the impact of the introduction of Help To Buy, which could suggest an element of cautious optimism that the industry has perhaps \u2018turned the corner\u2019 following the trough of 2009. But if we are to reach the 200,000+ new build homes needed each year in England, there is still more momentum required.\u201d Britain\u2019s weak growth means there\u2019s even less chance of UK interest rates rising soon, despite inflation surging over the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s Sam Hill reckons borrowing costs will remain at record lows until early next year. The Bank of England\u2019s \u2018backcast\u2019 has 0.4% q/q in for Q1, so this revised outturn of 0.2% q/q is marginal downside news for policymakers. In our view, this GDP report reinforces the existing case for not responding to above-target inflation. Indeed, we continue to see the risk that the slowdown in activity becomes more entrenched and ultimately results in monetary policy being loosened in Q1 2018. The next government needs to boost investment and drive up wages, says TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady. Here\u2019s her take on the slowdown in UK growth in the last quarter: \u201cThis is a very worrying sign of the squeeze that families are feeling. Prices are rising faster than earnings, and households are getting deeper into debt. \u201cThe next government will inherit an economy that needs serious attention. An urgent priority must be to reverse the current fall in living standards. The minimum wage must go up faster, and the pay restrictions on public servants like nurses, firefighters and midwives must be ended. \u201cIt is also vital for Britain to increase investment in communities where good jobs are in short supply. More investment is needed in skills, transport links, broadband, decent homes and high quality public services.\u201d The TUC has published analysis this morning (Thursday) showing that unsecured debt per UK household will reach a record high this year of \u00a313,900. This exceeds the pre-crisis peak of \u00a313,300 in 2007. Uncertainty over Britain\u2019s looming exit from the European Union may have hit the economy, says ING\u2019s James Knightley: Today\u2019s growth downgrade means that Britain was one of the worst-performing advanced economies in the first three months of this year. Only Italy and America did as badly as the UK; they also grew by around 0.2% in Q1 2017. France expanded by 0.3%, Japan managed 0.5%, while Germany posted healthy growth of 0.6% and Spain\u2019s GDP surged by 0.8%. The Eurozone and the EU both grew by 0.5%. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway has dug into today\u2019s GDP data, and discovered that things are even worse than we thought. The UK actually grew by just 0.18% during Q1 (which was rounded up to 0.2%), which is the worst performance in over four years. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, is concerned by the sharp slowdown in UK growth. \u201cToday\u2019s GDP data indicate that the economy slowed even more than previously estimated in the first quarter of 2017, as consumer spending power was squeezed by rising prices. Excluding population growth, real GDP per head - the broadest measure of living standards in the economy - flatlined in the first quarter. \u201cEstimated GDP growth in Q1 2017 was revised down from 0.3% to 0.2% and further detail was released confirming that the slowdown was focused on consumer spending and related industry sectors such as retailing, hotels and restaurants, transport and communications. But he does spot some reasons for optimism- including the rise in business investment, and higher government spending too. Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation confirms that Britain\u2019s growth rate was ZERO in the last quarter, once you adjust for population increases. He also shows how Britain\u2019s growth since the financial crisis is rather less impressive on a per-capita basis (ie, growth per person). Today\u2019s growth report also shows that public sector workers are suffering the biggest impact from rising inflation (which hit 2.7% in April), as their wages are lagging behind the private sector. The ONS says: Compensation of employees, which includes wages and salaries and employers\u2019 social contributions, showed positive growth of 0.6% seasonally adjusted in Quarter 1 2017. Non-seasonally adjusted, growth was chiefly driven by strong positive growth in private sector wages and salaries, in turn driven by bonus payments typically made at Quarter 1 and a smaller fall in growth in private sector jobs than seen in previous Quarter 1s\u2019. This was partially offset by a small fall in public sector wages and salaries. Here\u2019s a handy chart showing how net trade (red) had a negative impact on growth in January-to-March: Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from the squeeze on real wages, as inflation overtakes earnings, says Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation. She explains: \u201cWhile the downward revision may have been unexpected, the reasons behind the weakness surely aren\u2019t. Sluggish household spending growth, a consequence of the squeeze on real incomes starting to kick in, and some pull back on export growth after an impressive end to last year. \u201cWe expect the consumer weakness to persist as wage growth falls further behind rising prices, but there should be some turnaround on the trade front, driven by a brighter outlook in the rest of the world. For those on the hunt for some good news in the data it was to be found in the investment numbers. Business investment picked up at the start of this year and some big revisions to investment at the end of last year mean the investment picture isn\u2019t as dire as first thought. Still, we\u2019ll need to see this rebound continue and strengthen if for longer-term productivity prospects to improve.\u201d Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, also blames the rising cost of living: \u201cJust as expected higher inflation is squeezing incomes and spending. High inflation is hitting consumers, but a weak pound and a recovering global economy are helping businesses. UK growth is likely to tilt away from the consumer towards exports, manufacturing and investment this year. This should keep the UK economy growing at a similar rate to last year.\u201d Only one City economist expected Britain\u2019s growth rate to be revised down to 0.2% today, says Reuters\u2019 Ross Finlay. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, is disappointed that Britain\u2019s net trade was so weak last quarter, despite the weak pound: The FT\u2019s Sarah O\u2019Connor flags up that Britain\u2019s productivity crisis is even worse than we thought (figures last week showed a fall of 0.5%, but today\u2019s figures suggest an even darker picture). But economist Rupert Seggins is encouraged that business investment rose (by 1.2%), despite the Brexit uncertainty. Britain\u2019s economy didn\u2019t grow at all in the last quarter, if you account for the increase in population. Today\u2019s new figures show that GDP on a per-capita basis was flat in Q1 2017, compared to the final three months of 2016. So while the economy got a bit bigger, individuals didn\u2019t actually feel the benefit. The bad news is that net trade took a big bite out of Britain\u2019s growth rate. Net trade wiped 1.4 percentage points off the growth rate, dashing hopes that the weaker pound would be a massive boost to exporters. The ONS says. Within net trade, there has been a rise in total imports, which have contributed negatively to UK GDP, with a notable contribution from transport equipment, machinery and chemicals. And adjusting for inflation, household spending in the first quarter of 2017 rose by just 0.3%. That\u2019s the smallest amount since the final three months of 2014 -- underlining how inflation is hurting. The good news is that businesses invested more in new plants and machinery at the start of this year. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) increased by 1.2% compared with Quarter 4 2016, today\u2019s GDP report shows. Today\u2019s growth figures confirm that UK households were hit by the impact of higher inflation, due to the weak pound. The Office for National Statistics explains: UK GDP growth slowed to 0.2% in Quarter 1 2017 as consumer facing industries such as retail and accommodation fell and household spending slowed. This was partly due to rising prices. Construction and manufacturing also showed little growth, while business services &amp; finance continued to grow strongly. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s economic growth in the first quarter of this year was even weake than we thought. Growth has been revised down to just 0.2% for January to March, down from the first estimate of 0.3%. That\u2019s the weakest growth since the first three month of 2016, and shows that the economy is less robust then we thought. The ONS now believes that the UK service sector grew by just 0.2%, not the 0.3% first expected. Industrial output has been revised down too, from +0.3% to +0.1%. More details and reaction to follow! As expected, Iraq is also backing a nine-month extension: Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister says that a nine-month cuts extension is \u2018highly likely\u2019 to be agreed today. Khalid al-Falih adds that he doesn\u2019t expect any deeper cuts, though. That implies that the current agreement to shave 1.8m barrels-per-day off global outlook would be extended And we\u2019re off! A flurry of comments are hitting the wires as Opec ministers speak to reports. Kuwait\u2019s energy minister says he expects a nine-month extensions to the current output cut deal, but doesn\u2019t expect any deeper cuts. Here\u2019s a snap from inside the Opec meeting, via Algerian energy minister Noureddine Bouterfa. No pushing at the back, please. The journalists sent to Vienna to cover today\u2019s meeting are getting hot under the collar, literally. They\u2019ve been queuing, more-or-less patiently, in a stairwell for around an hour - waiting to be allowed into the opening session. These Opec meetings can get quite frenzied, as reporters compete to hear from oil ministers. Last November\u2019s gathering was particularly heated - several ornaments were broken amid media scrums, and one reporter briefly lost her shoe. Some City analysts are sceptical about whether Opec can really influence the oil price, as many producers - such as America - aren\u2019t part of the cartel. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the markets \u201cfully\u201d expect a nine-month extension to the current deal. Many are wondering if the group has any rabbits to pull of its hat to mitigate the risk of a buy the rumour, sell the fact reaction. It is not actually certain that the extension will be 9 months rather than six, even if the noises have been in that direction, or if any other Non-OPEC countries do sign up, they are at best likely to be very marginal producers such as Tajikistan, and per se more an optical addition than \u2018game changers\u2019 Oil ministers are arriving at the Opec HQ now. There\u2019s a live webcast from the hotel here. Three Opec delegates have told Reuters that a nine-month output extension is the \u201cmost likely scenario\u201d. One says that a one-year extension (to June 2018) is an option. Reuters\u2019 Amanda Cooper has the details: Here\u2019s the full agenda of the Opec meeting (timings are in CEST, so knock off an hour for BST). Some background. Last November, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to cut their combined output by around 1.8 million barrels per day through the first six months of this year. That deal did drive the oil price over $50 per barrel, but any hopes (or fears) that prices would push higher have been dashed (or allayed). As this chart shows, the oil price actually dipped back in recent weeks, before rallying on hopes that the deal will be extended today. Queues are forming outside Opec\u2019s headquarters in the Austrian capital, ahead of today\u2019s meeting: The oil price is jumping this morning, on predictions that Opec will extend its existing output cuts today. Brent crude has gained almost 1% to $54.45 per barrel, and New York crude is up 0.75% at $51.75 per barrel. That underlines how the markets expect the oil cartel to agree to pump less oil at today\u2019s meeting. Nigeria\u2019s oil minister has bolstered hopes of a nine-month extension -- and possibly even longer: Barclays analysts have argued that a mere six-month extension would be a blunder, as it would expire at the end of this year - when oil demand is weak. Extending the deal into 2018 would mean that Opec members would ramp up output when demand is strengthening. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on Vienna this morning as energy ministers from the Opec oil cartel meet. On the agenda: whether or not to extend the oil production cuts deal which was agreed six months ago. Oil analysts broadly expect an extension to be hammered out \u2013 as the alternative would spook the markets and send prices spiralling down. But the big issue is how long for. Saudi Arabia (Opec\u2019s biggest member) is pushing for a nine-month extension, and Iraq backed this plan earlier this week. But there have been whispers that Opec might only extend oil output cuts by a mere six months, or could go the whole hog with a 12 month deal. So there\u2019s all to play for in Vienna today. Kathleen Brooks of City Index predicts that the Saudi\u2019s will get their way: The oil cartel meets today, and the market is expecting it to extend the period of production cuts by an extra nine months, through to March 2018. This has been widely signalled after Russia (a non-Opec member) and Saudi Arabia said that they would support an extension of the cuts last week. There is a very small chance that some of the smaller, struggling members of Opec, including Venezuela and Nigeria, may resist the prospect of further cuts, overall we think that Saudi Arabia will ultimately get what it wants from this meeting. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Opec should be wary of disappointing the markets: Also coming up today: We\u2019re about to get fresh information on how the British economy performed in the first three months of this year. The second estimate of UK GDP will reveal how business investment, net trade, personal spending and government spending changed over the quarter. The City predict that consumer spending took a dive, as rising inflation hits shoppers. Royal Bank of Canada say: It is expected that a much more modest contribution from the consumer will be behind the lower growth figure, as real household disposable incomes have been hit by rising prices. The Office for National Statistics is also expected to confirm that GDP only rose by a modest 0.3% in January-to-March, down from 0.7% in October-December. 9am BST: Opec opening session begins in Vienna 9.30am BST: Second estimate of UK GDP released 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for April 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures 4pm BST: Opec press conference We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Fever-Tree, the upmarket tonic water maker, suffered the rarest of hiccups in its meteoric rise after co-founder Charles Rolls cashed in \u00a373m of shares. The sale left the company\u2019s stock down 2% at \u00a317.12 on Thursday \u2013 but that is still nearly 13 times its \u00a31.34 price tag when it floated less than three years ago. Demand for the shares from City investors was so great that Rolls offloaded 4.5m shares, a 3.9% stake, having initially planned to release 2.5m. He retains an 11.2% holding worth \u00a3222m, and the company is valued at nearly \u00a32bn. That means Fever-Tree is worth more than Britvic, its 170-year old rival, more than the UK arm of Domino\u2019s Pizza, and about three times as much as the Debenhams store chain. That is astonishing for a business with sales of just \u00a3100m and only 46 full-time staff that has done little more than concoct a fancy mixer for gin. But it is testament to the super-speed growth the company has delivered since Rolls and co-founder Tim Warrillow launched it in 2005. From a standing start, the duo became millionaires within a decade, selling \u00a325m of stock between them when they floated the company on the AIM market in 2014. Rolls has cashed out to the tune of \u00a3100m, because he also sold a \u00a312m tranche of shares last year. He owes not just his fortune but apparently his life to tonic water \u2013 or at least to its key medicinal ingredient, quinine. He once contracted malaria during a trip to Africa and has credited the chemical, obtained from the bark of the cinchona tree referenced in the company\u2019s name, with saving his life. Though the company started out with tonic water, it has expanded to include variants on the drink, as well as Sicilian lemonade and ginger ale. It has managed to stand out from the crowd by consciously embracing luxury status, making much of the exotic origin of its ingredients and the great expense of getting them into your glass. Its ginger comes from Ivory Coast and Nigeria, its lemons from Sicily, and Warrillow once braved checkpoints manned by militiamen to source quinine from a remote part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These are the credentials that have ensured no luxury hotel or Michelin-starred restaurant is without a supply of Fever-Tree in its mixer cabinet. Indeed, one of the company\u2019s early customers was world-renowned chef Ferran Adri\u00e0, who made its tonic a firm fixture in his restaurant El Bulli, rated by many gastronomes as the world\u2019s best and quirkiest restaurant before it served up its last liquid olive in 2011. Posh tonic has also benefited from a serendipitous resurgence in gin, increasingly seen as a sophisticated spirit worth splashing out on. Gin menus are a common feature of bars in countries where the spirit is particularly popular such as the UK, Spain and US. And premium gins demand to be mixed with premium tonics. Fever-Tree has ridden the crest of this alcoholic wave like no other company, reporting pre-tax profits last year that more than doubled to \u00a334.3m on sales of \u00a3102m. This month, the company announced that its 2017 results would comfortably exceed City forecasts, indicating that the Fever-Tree star is still very much in the ascendancy. Rolls, a former management consultant who revived the Plymouth Gin brand, and Warrilow, a former ad man, teamed up in an attempt to challenge the domination by Schweppes of the mixers market. Rolls had noticed that the world\u2019s finest gins were mixed with the same mass-produced tonic. \u201cThere\u2019s no point having a good gin if the tonic isn\u2019t right,\u201d he said, pointing out that tonic makes up the lion\u2019s share of a G&amp;T, at least if it is made right. This year, Rolls ended his day-to-day involvement in the company, moving from executive deputy chairman to a non-executive position. That might explain why he feels able to start cashing in, a decision that might have given investors pause for thought if he were still engaged in building the business. And with an extra \u00a373m in the bank, Rolls has little reason to wait until the sun is past the yard-arm for his first G&amp;T of the day.",

In a key case relating to the gig economy, the Central Arbitration Committee is investigating whether Deliveroo\u2019s drivers are independent contractors, as the company argues, or whether they should be classified as workers with rights to holiday pay, the national minimum wage and collective bargaining via a union. The hearing relates to couriers in the Camden and Kentish Town districts of north London but is seen as a test case for riders across the UK, including those working for other firms similar to Deliveroo. Deliveroo\u2019s UK managing director, Dan Warne, said that the company was \u201ccommitted to protecting the full flexibility that riders enjoy, and is fighting for riders ability to work with Deliveroo and its competitors at the same time\u201d. The food delivery firm tried to have the case dismissed on the basis that not enough riders in the Camden and Kentish Town area had expressed an interest in joining the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which backed strike action by riders last year. Deliveroo told the CAC that fewer than 50 of the 213 riders signed up to its systems in the Camden area were union members. However, the IWGB disputed those numbers and told the CAC panel that riders had been put off joining up by a \u201ccampaign of misinformation\u201d by Deliveroo. Quoting from emails and transcripts of recorded conversations, John Hendy QC, the barrister for the riders, said couriers had been told by Deliveroo managers that if they gained worker status they would no longer be classed as self-employed. He said the riders were also told they could be sacked for not wearing a uniform, would have to work set hours and be paid via PAYE so that they could not manage their own tax affairs. Hendy said that Deliveroo had deliberately been \u201cfogging\u201d the definition of worker status to \u201cintimidate riders from joining the IWGB\u201d. Previous cases have shown it is possible to be self-employed and classified as a worker, but Deliveroo\u2019s director, David Scott, told the CAC that he had been legally advised that you could not. Under questioning from Hendy, Scott admitted there was not a \u201cdirect connection\u201d between a change in status for Deliveroo\u2019s riders and the imposition of uniforms or hourly pay rates.

He said \u201cthe instructions you give riders is to ensure any legal duty is fulfilled\u201d and that it was \u201cunreal\u201d to suggest riders could employ a substitute given how Deliveroo checked criminal background, equipment and health and safety knowledge. Hendy said: \u201cDo you think restaurant owners would be surprised that Deliveroo permits substitutes that may be convicted rapists or paedophiles untrained in food hygiene that have been told not to wear dirty clothes or to have dirty bags or to be warned about allergy contaminations ... they would be outraged.\u201d He added: \u201cEither Deliveroo has no regard for its reputation or the picture you paint is false.\u201d Hendy said if riders were able to freely appoint substitutes then Deliveroo would also have no way of knowing if those people had properly been informed or trained in those matters.

      "bodyText": "More than \u00a3630m was wiped off the value of UK oil services group Petrofac when the company revealed it had suspended its chief operating officer and taken other measures in response to a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). Petrofac said Marwan Chedid had been suspended until further notice and resigned from the board. The chief executive, Ayman Asfari, a major Tory donor who owns 18% of the firm, is to stay in his post but will be excluded from all matters connected to the investigation. The SFO said on 12 May that it was investigating the company, its employees and agents for suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering. The company\u2019s shares closed down nearly 30%, falling from 615p to 430p to value the company at about \u00a31.5bn. Twelve months ago, they were changing hands at around 800p. The SFO probe is linked to its investigation of Unaoil, a Monaco-based firm that has been accused of corruptly securing contracts for multinationals. Unaoil has denied any wrongdoing. Petrofac\u2019s Asfari and Chedid were arrested, questioned under caution by the SFO and released without charge. Asfari , who has donated \u00a3700,000 to the Conservative party over the past 8 years, is one of the government\u2019s network of business ambassadors, with the role of acting as an advocate for the UK abroad. A government spokeswoman said Asfari would continue in the role and refused to comment on the SFO investigation. The decision on whether he should remain an ambassador lies with Theresa May. Petrofac employed Unaoil for consultancy work in Kazakhstan between 2002 and 2009. Petrofac said it had commissioned an independent investigation last year into media allegations in relation to Unaoil and passed its findings on to the SFO, which then told Petrofac that it did not accept those findings. The SFO has also told Petrofac that it does not consider it has received cooperation from the company. Petrofac has now set up a committee of the board led by its chairman, Rijnhard van Tets, to engage with the SFO and is in the process of appointing a senior external specialist to oversee the group\u2019s management of the investigation. The specialist will also review Petrofac\u2019s compliance processes. Van Tets said: \u201cThese decisions signal the board\u2019s determination to cooperate fully with the SFO and its investigation, whilst ensuring Petrofac continues to deliver for its clients.\u201d Petrofac stressed that the action taken did \u201cnot in any way seek to prejudge the outcome of the SFO\u2019s investigation\u201d. It added that it had provided \u201clarge volumes of information in response to very broad requests\u201d made by the SFO. The most recent donation to the Conservative party from Asfari and his wife was \u00a340,000 last December. The Syrian-born businessman is a member of the leader\u2019s group, an elite set of donors who are invited to dine with the prime minister.",

      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee from June 2006 to May 2009 This month the big economic story is all about declining real wage growth. Wages have been growing at around 2% for the last three years or so, although the exact rate depends on what measure is used. The best indicator is probably pay settlements, which XpertHR have shown have not been as high as 3% for eight years and have not moved from 2% for three years. When inflation fell below 2% as it did in 2015 and 2016, that meant that real wages were on the rise. Real wages matter because that impacts living standards and what workers can buy. Prices rising less than wages = good; prices rising more than wages = bad. That has reversed itself this month. Inflation has been rising since the Brexit vote as the pound\u2019s sharp drop makes imports to the UK, such as food ingredients and fuel, more expensive. A rise in crude oil prices has also added to the upward pressure on inflation and last month it hit 2.7%, higher than economists had been expecting and well above the Bank of England\u2019s target for inflation at 2.0%. It was the highest inflation rate since September 2013, pushed up in part by higher air fares for Easter and also rising prices for clothing, vehicle excise duty and electricity. I fully expect that inflation will continue its inexorable rise during 2017. Even though unemployment was better than forecast, official data confirmed pay growth failed to keep pace with inflation in the opening three months of 2017 and so wages were falling in real terms. Excluding bonuses, average earnings were up 2.1% year on year, missing economists\u2019 forecasts for a 2.2% rise. Once adjusted for inflation, regular pay fell 0.2% in the three months to March. Pay awards are also settling in below the rate of retail prices index (RPI) inflation. With RPI at 3.5% in April 2017, we now see the largest negative gap between the two indicators since December 2011. Regular weekly pay, excluding bonuses, adjusting for prices were \u00a3465 a week in March 2017 according to the Office for National Statistics. This contrasts with \u00a3472 a week in March 2007 before the start of the great recession. So pay packets buy less than they did a decade ago. Retail sales defied economists\u2019 expectations in April and rose at the fastest pace for more than a year, in large part due to the warm weather but companies are expecting spending to ease off in May. Workers are being punished by Brexit. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 This month\u2019s economic data paints a picture broadly consistent with the pattern which has been emerging over the course of this year. CPI inflation has risen further to 2.7% \u2013 its highest level since the autumn of 2013, and prices are now rising faster than wages. The resulting squeeze on real wages is contributing to the slowdown on the consumer side of the economy. We should be cautious about reading too much into the bounce-back in retail sales in April. The pattern of retail sales in March and April is very sensitive to the timing of Easter and weather effects, so it makes sense to look at spending patterns over a number of months. The volume of retail spending in the past three months is just 0.3% up on the previous three months \u2013 representing an annual growth rate of just over 1%. This is very subdued growth in the retail sector \u2013 it compares with an average of 4.4% annual increase in spending over the three years 2014-16. There has been more positive news on the jobs front \u2013 with the unemployment rate dropping to 4.6%, the lowest since 1975. Employment growth appears to be picking up again after a slowdown in the second half of last year. The numbers in employment were up by over 120,000 in the first quarter of this year \u2013 the biggest quarterly increase since the EU referendum. Construction and private services are the main sectors generating jobs in the UK currently \u2013 while employment is flatlining in manufacturing and the public sector. Meanwhile, the vacancy rate also points to a pickup in the demand for labour. The number of unfilled vacancies has risen to its highest level since the current data series started in 2001. Taking all this data together, it is generally consistent with the slowdown in economic growth which is expected by most economic forecasters this year and next. Despite this, optimism about global prospects plus a decline in the value of the pound against the euro has helped to push up the UK stock market, with the FTSE 100 hitting a record high in the middle of last week.",

      "bodyText": "The Brexit squeeze on household budgets has intensified over the past month, but companies and investors remain cautiously optimistic about the economic outlook in the run-up to the election, a Guardian analysis shows. With a fortnight to go until the general election, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news paints a mixed picture. Living standards are again falling, but while the economy has slowed markedly, as the latest GDP update showed, it continues to defy the gloomy forecasts of a Brexit recession made by some commentators this time last year. In the latest figures, unemployment is at the lowest level since 1975 and retail sales rebounded as shoppers apparently shrugged off any worries about rising prices to keep spending in April, although many retailers and economists take issue with the accuracy of the official data. Despite uncertainty over the impending Brexit negotiations with the rest of the EU, closely watched business surveys point to a buoyant mood across a broad range of companies and the FTSE 100 has set record highs. But in a worrying pattern for an economy so reliant on consumer spending, other indicators show household incomes are being eroded as pay growth fails to keep pace with rising prices. Official figures show GDP growth slowed markedly in the opening quarter of 2017 to 0.2%, from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016, as consumer spending was hurt by higher prices. The blow to the pound from last summer\u2019s referendum result is raising the cost of imports to the UK and inflation is at its highest level for three-and-a-half years. Pay growth has stalled, despite low unemployment and reports that companies are struggling to fill vacancies. The news that Britain\u2019s trade deficit widened more than expected in March has dampened hopes that stronger exports can make up for softer domestic demand. The latest GDP figures show net trade was a drag on overall economic growth in the first quarter. In a further blow to consumer confidence, the housing market has shown signs of slowing. That will leave homeowners feeling less flush, but the prospect of prices falling to more affordable levels will be welcomed by those trying to get on to the property ladder. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. The dashboard for May shows retail sales have rebounded, unemployment has dropped further and business activity continues to expand. But inflation is at its highest level for more than three years, wages are falling in real terms and Britain\u2019s trade performance has deteriorated. House prices continue to edge up, but estate agents say the market is slowing. The deficit was wider than forecast in April as lower VAT receipts took their toll on the public finances. Compared with economists\u2019 forecasts, there was a better than expected performance in four of the eight categories. Two were worse than expected and one was as forecast. Inflation was higher than commentators had been expecting. Writing in the Guardian, the former Bank of England policymaker David Blanchflower said the big economic story this month was \u201call about declining real wage growth\u201d. \u201cWorkers are being punished by Brexit,\u201d said Blanchflower, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US. He noted that regular weekly pay once adjusted for price rises was \u00a3465 a week in March 2017. \u201cThis contrasts with \u00a3472 a week in March 2007, before the start of the \u2018great recession\u2019. So pay packets buy less than they did a decade ago,\u201d he said. While pressures on domestic consumers are rising, the more internationally focused FTSE 100 share index has set record highs in the past month. On currency exchanges, the pound has recovered some ground against a US dollar weakened by doubts around the political future of Donald Trump. But sterling has dipped against the euro. It is still down by more than 10% against the dollar and euro when compared with the day of the referendum last June. \u201cThe pound\u2019s sharp drop makes imports to the UK such as food ingredients and fuel more expensive,\u201d said Blanchflower, highlighting the rise in inflation to 2.7%, well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. With prices rising, it remains to be seen if retailers can continue to enjoy the strong sales growth they clocked up in April, when sunshine and Easter holidays drew in shoppers. Economists warn that it was most likely a one-off and that whichever party forms the next government after the 8 June general election will be faced with a tough economic outlook as the UK\u2019s main engine of growth, consumer spending, comes under pressure. Andrew Sentance, another former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, warned against reading too much into the latest retail sales data. He said the overall pattern from recent indicators was one of an economy losing steam. \u201cTaking all this data together, it is generally consistent with the slowdown in economic growth expected by most economic forecasters this year and next,\u201d said Sentance, a senior economic adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cDespite this, optimism about global prospects plus a decline in the value of the pound against the euro has helped to push up the UK stock market, with the FTSE 100 hitting a new record high in the middle of last week.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s latest outlook was for household budgets to be hit by a cocktail of higher inflation and slower pay growth this year. But it predicted living standards could start to recover in 2018. The Bank also forecast that the economy would continue to grow this year by 1.9%, more than double the 0.8% pace of growth it was predicting for 2017 in forecasts made last August following the Brexit vote.",

The DB11, the first model Aston Martin has launched under a technology partnership with Daimler, accounted for the majority of 1,203 vehicles sold during the period. Its popularity boosted car sales by 75%, doubled revenues to \u00a3188m and turned the \u00a330m loss suffered in the first quarter of last year into a \u00a35.9m profit before tax.

The marque was also driven by former 007 Sir Roger Moore, who died earlier this week, though he only took the wheel of an Aston Martin in The Persuaders! and never as Bond. The turnaround plan follows a difficult period for the company, which announced plans to lay off 300 people in 2015, as it slumped to a pre-tax loss of \u00a371.8m.

      "bodyText": "Anglo-Swiss chemicals firm Ineos has bought the oil and gas business of Dong Energy for \u00a31bn, a major milestone in the Danish company\u2019s switch from hydrocarbons to renewable energy. The acquisition is the latest in a buying spree by Ineos, which recently bought a significant North Sea oil pipeline for \u00a3200m from BP, and takes it from 28th biggest oil and gas producer in the region to the top 10. The move highlights two sharply contrasting strategies for Europe\u2019s energy companies: a doubling-down on fossil fuels or shifting exclusively to focus on clean energy. Ineos, which is funding the purchase through cash flow from its existing businesses including the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, said the acquisition was a \u201cvery logical\u201d step. \u201cIt builds on what we\u2019ve got. It brings us to a much bigger scale \u2013 100,000-plus barrels a day,\u201d said Geir Tuft, a senior executive at Ineos, which also increased its shale gas acreage in the UK by a tenth in March. He said the company was sanguine about the relatively low oil price of about $50 a barrel, as it would keep costs low. Tuft said the Dong deal, which was higher than analysts\u2019 valuations, reflected the companies\u2019 differing strategies. \u201cWe\u2019re of the opinion that hydrocarbons, and gas in particular, are still a significant part of the energy equation for the world for many years to come.\u201d Around 440 Dong staff will transfer to Ineos. State-owned Dong, named after its origins as the Danish Oil and Natural Gas company, has now completed its plan of quitting oil and gas, which it first announced last November. When the sale completes in the third quarter, Dong will be left to focus on its core business of developing and selling windfarms, such as the one it recently built off the Liverpool coast using the world\u2019s biggest turbines. Henrik Poulsen, the company\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe transaction completes the transformation of Dong Energy into a leading pure play renewables company.\u201d The proceeds of the sale will go towards the six offshore windfarms the company is currently building. The company still has coal assets which it plans to divest. The move out of fossil fuels is one several major European energy companies are currently pursuing, such as France\u2019s Engie, which plans to earn 90% of its earnings before tax and interest from low carbon businesses by 2019. Experts at asset management firm Bernstein said the sale had fetched an attractive price for Dong, which floated on the stock market last year for \u00a310bn. Andrew Grant, of the UK-based thinktank Carbon Tracker, said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a one-size fits all conclusion for fossil fuel companies concerned about future demand. Some, like Dong, will be able to rebalance their portfolios into other assets like renewables. \u201cHowever, not all energy companies will feel their skills translate to low-carbon energy sources, but they can still deliver good results with a disciplined approach of focussing only on the lowest-cost oil and gas projects and returning excess cash to shareholders.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British car manufacturing went into reverse in April, with production falling at the fastest rate in more than two and a half years. A total of 122,116 cars rolled off UK production lines last month, 18% fewer than in April 2016, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The trade body attributed what was the sharpest fall since August 2014 to the late timing of Easter this year. \u201cCar production fell significantly in April due to the later Easter bank holiday weekend, which reduced the number of active production days that month, and also due to unplanned production adjustments,\u201d said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. The drop in car production echoed the trend in new car sales, which fell 20% in April compared with a year earlier, as government cuts to subsidies for green cars and a rise in prices hit demand. The UK car industry backed the remain camp in the run-up to the EU referendum and SMMT members are fearful about possible tariffs being imposed on parts imported from the EU after Brexit. The cost of assembling a car in Britain could increase by \u00a32,370 in the event of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, encouraging some manufacturers to look at moving production out of the country, according to PA Consulting Group. The average UK-built car has about 6,000 parts, with the majority coming from the EU and passing in and out of the country several times during the production process. \u201cTo guarantee future growth and investment into our industry and its vital supply chain, however, we need the next government to safeguard the conditions that have made us globally competitive, keeping us open and trading and delivering an ambitious industrial strategy for our sector,\u201d Hawes said. Taking the first four months of 2017 overall, almost 600,000 cars were built at UK factories, 1% more than over the same period a year earlier. Demand is being driven by foreign markets, with cars built for export up 3.5% in 2017 so far, while the number destined for the home market fell 7%. A total of 1.7m cars were produced in Britain in 2016, and the SMMT believes the number could surpass 2m by 2020, breaking the previous record of 1.92m set in 1972. Hawes said the broader trend for car production was positive. \u201cOverall, British car manufacturing remains in good health, with the production outlook still very positive and significant new models due to go into UK production shortly.\u201d The biggest manufacturers in the UK include Japan\u2019s Nissan in Sunderland, Indian-owned Jaguar Land Rover in the West Midlands and north-west, and German-owned Mini in Oxford.",

The average UK-built car has about 6,000 parts, with the majority coming from the EU and passing in and out of the country several times during the production process.</p> <p>\u201cTo guarantee future growth and investment into our industry and its vital supply chain, however, we need the next government to safeguard the conditions that have made us globally competitive, keeping us open and trading and delivering an ambitious industrial strategy for our sector,\u201d Hawes said. </p> <p>Taking the first four months of 2017 overall, almost 600,000 cars were built at UK factories, 1% more than over the same period a year earlier. Demand is being driven by foreign markets, with cars built for export up 3.5% in 2017 so far, while the number destined for the home market fell 7%.</p> <p>A total of 1.7m cars were produced in Britain in 2016, and the SMMT believes the number could surpass 2m by 2020, breaking the previous record of 1.92m set in 1972.</p> <p>Hawes said the broader trend for car production was positive. \u201cOverall, British car manufacturing remains in good health, with the production outlook still very positive and significant new models due to go into UK production shortly.\u201d </p> <p>The biggest manufacturers in the UK include Japan\u2019s Nissan in Sunderland, Indian-owned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jaguar-land-rover\">Jaguar Land Rover</a> in the West Midlands and north-west, and German-owned Mini in Oxford.</p>",
