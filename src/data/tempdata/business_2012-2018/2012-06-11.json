      "bodyText": "The Bank of England needs to turbo-charge its policy of printing money to save the economy from a long depression, according to one of the central bank's key policy makers. Adam Posen, who sits on the Bank's monetary policy committee, said it needed to extend its programme of quantitative easing and to take greater risks. Posen's stark warning is a reaction to the continuing recession and to the failure of Britain's banks to increase their corporate lending to small- and medium-sized companies. He said the Bank needed to take greater risks on its balance sheet to persuade investors it is safe to back British companies and get the economy moving ahead. His comments came as a report showed home purchases at their lowest level for five years and recruiters warned recent growth in permanent jobs had tailed off. RICS, which represents surveyors, said the dearth of transactions meant its members were completing 15.6 sales a year compared with 25.4 a year at the peak of the housing boom in May 2007.

      "bodyText": "A bailout of up to \u20ac100bn for Spain's ailing banks failed to calm nerves about the future of the euro on Monday amid confusion over the plan's details and worries that Greek voters might choose to abandon the single currency. The hurried bailout announcement after an emergency video conference of eurozone finance ministers at the weekend was meant to ease pressure on Spain and other troubled European economies ahead of Sunday's elections in Greece. But Spain's borrowing costs rose on Monday, nudging closer to levels that are considered unsustainable and dragging Italy towards the danger zone. Europe's stock markets fell slightly, despite an early bounce, the FTSE 100 in London finishing down 0.05%. Investors worried about uncertainty over the amount of bailout money Spain would take, the mechanism for providing it and the conditions attached to the deal. \"The size of the deal is meant to show a real commitment on the part of the eurozone to stabilise the system,\" said Robert Pavlik, of Banyan Partners. \"However, this just moves the problem down the road and shows how nervous the EU was going into the Greek election.\" Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy's triumphant approach to the bailout appeared to annoy Germany and other eurozone countries who must persuade sceptical voters that the money is well spent. As he tries to escape the devastating political price paid by other European leaders who have asked for bailouts, Rajoy has told Spaniards that the \u20ac100bn comes with no strings attached except for the banks receiving the money. He refuses to call it a bailout. But Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, warned that \u2013 as with Greece, Portugal and Ireland \u2013 Spain must answer to the feared \"troika\" that enforces the debt repayment terms imposed on other bailed out countries like Portugal, Greece and Ireland. The troika is made up of the European commission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank. \"The Spanish state is taking the loans, Spain will be responsible for them,\" Sch\u00e4uble said. \"There will likewise be a troika. There will of course be supervision to ensure that the programme is being complied with, but this refers only to the restructuring of the banks.\" \"Of course there will be conditions,\" EU competition commissioner Joaqu\u00edn Almunia added in a radio interview. \"Whoever gives money never gives it away for free.\" The eurozone ministers who approved the deal warned they would watch Spain's deficit-busting and reform programme carefully, but did not say whether loans would depend on Rajoy's government hitting targets. Rajoy's achievement in limiting the explicit conditions to Spain's banks has been broadly welcomed in a country that believes the rest of its economy needs no international oversight. But those countries already under troika control warned that they will demand a revision of their bailout terms if Spain receives special treatment. \"We will be watching the process of the specific programme for Spain's banking system closely,\" Portugal's prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho said. \"We cannot have first class and second class states,\" warned Portugal's opposition socialist leader Antonio Jos\u00e9 Seguro. Ireland's prime minister, Enda Kenny, has already said that if Spain wins soft terms, then these must be offered to others. Those terms will not be clear until Spain formally requests a sum of money. It is not clear whether this would be provided by the European Financial Stability Facility or the new arrangement which replaces it in July, the European Stability Mechanism. Other European leaders admitted that the bailout decision had been taken to avert yet another moment of panic in Europe's long-running debt crisis. \"We have managed to avoid a major crisis but the problems are still there,\" Finland's prime minister Jyrki Katainen told Reuters. Investors worried that the bailout was a temporary solution to Spain's problems as it falls back into recession and suffers 24% unemployment. \"Call it what you like, but this is a bailout, the first (and only for banks), but most likely not the last for Spain,\" said Oliver Burrows of Rabobank Credit Research, who pointed to the amount of government debt held by Spanish banks. \"We suspect that inevitably the Spanish government will have to seek its own bailout.\" The IMF said on Friday that Spain's former savings banks and some of its medium-sized commercial banks would jointly need at least \u20ac40bn. The government has said it will wait for two independent auditors to produce valuations of Spain's total bank assets before deciding how much money to ask for. They will make their first reports by 21 June and government sources have already suggested they will be close to the IMF figures. Recently part-nationalised Bankia has asked for \u20ac19bn and officials have recognised that two other banks need a further \u20ac9bn. But Spain's government has twice underestimated the sums needed to rescue its banks this year, with two rounds of provisioning totalling \u20ac80bn, and investors remain wary. \"Markets will certainly ask the question about whether a second bailout might be required and the margin for error between the sort of \u20ac40bn the IMF is saying and the \u20ac100bn ceiling,\" said Mark Miller of Capital Economics. In New York the Dow Jones index closed down 142 points, or 1.14%, having briefly rallied in early trading. Last week the Dow enjoyed its best rally of the year, in part on hopes of a concrete solution to the eurozone crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Up a rickety staircase at the Newarke Houses Museum in Leicester, England hangs a portrait of Britain's first obese man, painted in 1806. Daniel Lambert weighed 53st (335kg) and was considered a medical oddity. Too heavy to work, Lambert came up with an ingenious idea: he would charge people a shilling to see him. Lambert made a fortune, and his portrait shows him at the end of his life: affluent and respected \u2013 a celebrated son of Leicester. Two hundred years on, I'm in a bariatric ambulance (an alternative term for obese, favoured by the medical world because it's less shaming to patients) investigating why the UK is in the midst of an obesity crisis. The crew pick up a dozen Daniel Lamberts every week. Fifty-three stone is nothing special, it's at the lower end of the weight spectrum, with only the 80st patients worthy of mention when a shift finishes. The specially designed ambulance carries an array of bariatric gizmos including a \"spatula\" to help with people who have fallen out of bed or, on a recent occasion, an obese man jammed between the two walls in his hallway. As well as the ambulance, there's a convoy of support vehicles including a winch to lift patients onto a reinforced stretcher. In extreme cases, the cost of removing a patient to hospital can be up to \u00a3100,000, as seen in the recent case of 63st teenager Georgia Davis. But these people are not where the heartland of the obesity crisis lies. On average, in the UK, we are all \u2013 every man, woman and child \u2013 three stone heavier than we were in the mid-60s. We haven't noticed it happening, but this glacial shift has been mapped by bigger car seats, swimming cubicles, XL trousers dropped to L (L dropped to M). An elasticated nation with an ever-expanding sense of normality. Why are we so fat? We have not become greedier as a race. We are not, contrary to popular wisdom, less active \u2013 a 12-year study, which began in 2000 at Plymouth hospital, measured children's physical activity and found it the same as 50 years ago. But something has changed: and that something is very simple. It's the food we eat. More specifically, the sheer amount of sugar in that food, sugar we're often unaware of. The story begins in 1971. Richard Nixon was facing re-election. The Vietnam war was threatening his popularity at home, but just as big an issue with voters was the soaring cost of food. If Nixon was to survive, he needed food prices to go down, and that required getting a very powerful lobby on board \u2013 the farmers. Nixon appointed Earl Butz, an academic from the farming heartland of Indiana, to broker a compromise. Butz, an agriculture expert, had a radical plan that would transform the food we eat, and in doing so, the shape of the human race. Butz pushed farmers into a new, industrial scale of production, and into farming one crop in particular: corn. US cattle were fattened by the immense increases in corn production. Burgers became bigger. Fries, fried in corn oil, became fattier. Corn became the engine for the massive surge in the quantities of cheaper food being supplied to American supermarkets: everything from cereals, to biscuits and flour found new uses for corn. As a result of Butz's free-market reforms, American farmers, almost overnight, went from parochial small-holders to multimillionaire businessmen with a global market. One Indiana farmer believes that America could have won the cold war by simply starving the Russians of corn. But instead they chose to make money. By the mid-70s, there was a surplus of corn. Butz flew to Japan to look into a scientific innovation that would change everything: the mass development of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), or glucose-fructose syrup as it's often referred to in the UK, a highly sweet, gloppy syrup, produced from surplus corn, that was also incredibly cheap. HFCS had been discovered in the 50s, but it was only in the 70s that a process had been found to harness it for mass production. HFCS was soon pumped into every conceivable food: pizzas, coleslaw, meat. It provided that \"just baked\" sheen on bread and cakes, made everything sweeter, and extended shelf life from days to years. A silent revolution of the amount of sugar that was going into our bodies was taking place. In Britain, the food on our plates became pure science \u2013 each processed milligram tweaked and sweetened for maximum palatability. And the general public were clueless that these changes were taking place. There was one product in particular that it had a dramatic effect on \u2013 soft drinks. Hank Cardello, the former head of marketing at Coca-Cola, tells me that in 1984, Coke in the US swapped from sugar to HFCS (In the UK, it continued to use sugar). As a market leader, Coke's decision sent a message of endorsement to the rest of the industry, which quickly followed suit. There was \"no downside\" to HFCS, Cardello says. It was two-thirds the price of sugar, and even the risk of messing with the taste was a risk worth taking when you looked at the margin, especially as there were no apparent health risks. At that time, \"obesity wasn't even on the radar\" says Cardello. But another health issue was on the radar: heart disease, and in the mid-70s, a fierce debate was raging behind the closed doors of academia over what was causing it. An American nutritionist called Ancel Keys blamed fat, while a British researcher at the University of London Professor John Yudkin, blamed sugar. But Yudkin's work was rubbished by what many believe, including Professor Robert Lustig, one of the world's leading endocrinologists, was a concerted campaign to discredit Yudkin. Much of the criticism came from fellow academics, whose research was aligning far more closely with the direction the food industry was intending to take. Yudkin's colleague at the time, Dr Richard Bruckdorfer at UCL says: \"There was a huge lobby from [the food] industry, particularly from the sugar industry, and Yudkin complained bitterly that they were subverting some of his ideas.\" Yudkin was, Lustig says simply, \"thrown under the bus\", because there was a huge financial gain to be made by fingering fat, not sugar, as the culprit of heart disease. The food industry had its eyes on the creation of a new genre of food, something they knew the public would embrace with huge enthusiasm, believing it to be better for their health \u2013 \"low fat\". It promised an immense business opportunity forged from the potential disaster of heart disease. But, says Lustig, there was a problem. \"When you take the fat out of a recipe, food tastes like cardboard, and you need to replace it with something \u2013 that something being sugar.\" Overnight, new products arrived on the shelves that seemed too good to be true. Low-fat yoghurts, spreads, even desserts and biscuits. All with the fat taken out, and replaced with sugar. Britain was one of the most enthusiastic adopters of what food writer Gary Taubes, author of Why We Get Fat, calls \"the low-fat dogma\", with sales rocketing. By the mid-80s, health experts such as Professor Philip James, a world-renowned British scientist who was one of the first to identify obesity as an issue, were noticing that people were getting fatter and no one could explain why. The food industry was keen to point out that individuals must be responsible for their own calorie consumption, but even those who exercised and ate low-fat products were gaining weight. In 1966 the proportion of people with a BMI of over 30 (classified as obese) was just 1.2% for men and 1.8% for women. By 1989 the figures had risen to 10.6% for men and 14.0% for women. And no one was joining the dots between HFCS and fat. Moreover, there was something else going on. The more sugar we ate, the more we wanted, and the hungrier we became. At New York University, Professor Anthony Sclafani, a nutritionist studying appetite and weight gain, noticed something strange about his lab rats. When they ate rat food, they put on weight normally. But when they ate processed food from a supermarket, they ballooned in a matter of days. Their appetite for sugary foods was insatiable: they just carried on eating. According to Professor Jean-Marc Schwarz of San Francisco hospital, who is currently studying the precise way in which the major organs of the body metabolise sugar, this momentum creates \"a tsunami\" of sugar. The effect this has on different organs in the body is only now being understood by scientists. Around the liver, it coalesces as fat, leading to diseases such as type-2 diabetes. Other studies have found that sugar may even coat semen and result in obese men becoming less fertile. One researcher told me that, ultimately, perhaps nothing needs to be done about obesity, as obese people will wipe themselves out. The organ of most interest, however, is the gut. According to Schwarz and Sclafani, the gut is a highly complex nervous system. It is the body's \"second brain\", and this second brain becomes conditioned to wanting more sugar, sending messages back to the brain that are impossible to fight. The Sugar Association is keen to point out that sugar intake alone \"is not linked to any lifestyle disease\". But evidence to the contrary appears to be emerging. In February, Lustig, Laura Schmidt and Claire Brindis of the University of California wrote an opinion article for the journal Nature citing the growing body of scientific evidence showing that fructose can trigger processes that lead to liver toxicity and a host of other chronic diseases, and in March, the New York Times reported a study that had been published in the journal Circulation, which found that men who drank sweetened beverages most often were 20% more likely to have had a heart attack than those who drank the least. David Kessler, the former head of the US government's most powerful food agency, the FDA, and the person responsible for introducing warnings on cigarette packets in the early 90s, believes that sugar, through its metabolisation by the gut and hence the brain, is extremely addictive, just like cigarettes or alcohol. He believes that sugar is hedonic \u2013 eating it is \"highly pleasurable. It gives you this momentary bliss. When you're eating food that is highly hedonic, it sort of takes over your brain.\" In London, Dr Tony Goldstone is mapping out the specific parts of the brain that are stimulated by this process. According to Goldstone, one of the by-products of obesity is that a hormone called leptin ceases to work properly. Normally, leptin is produced by the body to tell you that you are full. However, in obese people, it becomes severely depleted, and it is thought that a high intake of sugar is a key reason. When the leptin doesn't work, your body simply doesn't realise you should stop eating. Leptin raises a big question: did the food industry knowingly create foods that were addictive, that would make you feel as though you were never satisfied and always wanted more? Kessler is cautious in his response: \"Did they understand the neuroscience? No. But they learned experientially what worked.\" This is highly controversial. If it could be proved that at that some point the food industry became aware of the long-term, detrimental effects their products were having on the public, and continued to develop and sell them, the scandal would rival that of what happened to the tobacco industry. The food industry's defence has always been that the science doesn't prove its culpability. Susan Neely, president of the American Beverage Association, a lobby group for the soft-drinks industry, says: \"there's a lot of work to try to establish causality, and I don't know that I've seen any study that does that.\" But it looks as though things might be changing. According to Professor Kelly Brownell at Yale University, one of the world's foremost experts on obesity and its causes, the science will soon be irrefutable and we may then be just a few years away from the first successful lawsuit. The relationship between the food industry and the scientists conducting research into obesity is also complicated by the issue of funding. There is not a great deal of money set aside for this work and so the food industry has become a vital source of income. But this means that the very same science going into combating obesity could also be used to hone the products that are making us obese. Many of the scientists I spoke to are wary about going on the record because they fear their funding will be taken away if they speak out. The relationship between government and the food industry is also far from straightforward. Health secretary Andrew Lansley worked, until 2009, as a non-executive director of Profero, a marketing agency whose clients have included Pizza Hut, Mars and PepsiCo. In opposition, Lansley asked public health expert Professor Simon Capewell to contribute to future policy on obesity. Capewell was amazed at the degree to which the food industry was also being consulted: the equivalent, he says, \"of putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank\". Lansley has made no secret of his work for Profero, and denies a conflict of interest, saying that he did not work directly with the company's clients. And the government argues, not unreasonably, that it's essential to have the industry on board to get anything done. But the relationships are not always kept at arms length. Professor James was part of a WHO committee to recommend global limits on sugar in 1990. As the report was being drafted, something extraordinary happened: the US secretary of state for health Tommy Thompson flew to Geneva to lobby on behalf of the sugar industry. \"Those recommendations were never made,\" says James. In New York, Mayor Bloomberg is currently planning to reduce soft drink super-sizing while last week, a former executive at Coca-Cola Todd Putman spoke publicly about the need for soft drink companies to move their focus to \"healthy products\". But it's not going to be easy to bring about change. A previous attempt to bring in a soda tax was stopped by intense lobbying on Capitol Hill. The soft-drinks industry paid for a new ward at Philadelphia Children's Hospital, and the tax went away. It was a children's obesity ward. Why has Kessler, when he has had such success with his warnings on cigarette packets, not done the same thing for processed foods high in sugar? Because, he tells me, when the warnings came in on cigarettes, the game was already up in the west for the tobacco industry. Their new markets were the far east, India and China. It was no concession at all. The food industry is a different matter. For one thing, the food lobby is more powerful than the tobacco lobby. The industry is tied into a complex matrix of other interests: drugs, chemicals, even dieting products. The panoply of satellite industries that make money from obesity means the food industry's relationship to obesity is an incredibly complex one. Anne Milton, the minister for public health, tells me that legislation against the food industry isn't being ruled out, because of the escalating costs to the NHS. Previous governments have always taken the route of partnership. Why? Because the food industry provides hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in revenue. It is immensely powerful, and any politician who takes it on does so at their peril. \"Let's get one thing straight,\" Milton tells me, however. \"I am not scared of the food industry.\" And I believe her, because now, there is something far bigger to be frightened of. Eventually, the point will be reached when the cost to the NHS of obesity, which is now \u00a35bn a year, outweighs the revenue from the UK snacks and confectionery market, which is currently approximately \u00a38bn a year. Then the solution to obesity will become very simple. \u2022 The Men Who Made Us Fat, 9pm, Thursday, BBC2.",

Too heavy to work, Lambert came up with an ingenious idea: he would charge people a shilling to see him. Lambert made a fortune, and his portrait shows him at the end of his life: affluent and respected \u2013 a celebrated son of Leicester.</p> <p>Two hundred years on, I'm in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/feb/03/ambulance-services-adapt-larger-patients\" title=\"\">bariatric ambulance</a> (an alternative term for obese, favoured by the medical world because it's less shaming to patients) investigating why the UK is in the midst of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity\" title=\"\">obesity crisis</a>. The crew pick up a dozen Daniel Lamberts every week. Fifty-three stone is nothing special, it's at the lower end of the weight spectrum, with only the 80st patients worthy of mention when a shift finishes. The specially designed ambulance carries an array of bariatric gizmos including a \"spatula\" to help with people who have fallen out of bed or, on a recent occasion, an obese man jammed between the two walls in his hallway. As well as the ambulance, there's a convoy of support vehicles including a winch to lift patients onto a reinforced stretcher. In extreme cases, the cost of removing a patient to hospital can be up to \u00a3100,000, as seen in the recent case of <a href=\"http://m.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2150598/Georgia-Davis-63-stone-teens-desperate-plea-I-stand-sparks-100k-rescue-operation.html\" title=\"\">63st teenager Georgia Davis</a>.</p> <p>But these people are not where the heartland of the obesity crisis lies. On average, in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7307756/Obesity-rates-20-per-cent-higher-now-than-in-the-1960s.html\" title=\"\">we are all \u2013 every man, woman and child \u2013 three stone heavier than we were in the mid-60s</a>. We haven't noticed it happening, but this glacial shift has been mapped by bigger car seats, swimming cubicles, XL trousers dropped to L (L dropped to M). An elasticated nation with an ever-expanding sense of normality.</p> <p>Why are we so fat? We have not become greedier as a race. We are not, contrary to popular wisdom, less active \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.earlybirddiabetes.org/\" title=\"\">a 12-year study, which began in 2000 at Plymouth hospital</a>, measured children's physical activity and found it the same as 50 years ago. But something has changed: and that something is very simple. It's the food we eat. More specifically, the sheer amount of sugar in that food, sugar we're often unaware of.</p> <p>The story begins in 1971. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-nixon\" title=\"\">Richard Nixon</a> was facing re-election. The Vietnam war was threatening his popularity at home, but just as big an issue with voters was the soaring cost of food. If Nixon was to survive, he needed food prices to go down, and that required getting a very powerful lobby on board \u2013 the farmers. Nixon appointed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/04/usa.obituaries\" title=\"\">Earl Butz</a>, an academic from the farming heartland of Indiana, to broker a compromise. Butz, an agriculture expert, had a radical plan that would transform the food we eat, and in doing so, the shape of the human race.</p> <p>Butz pushed farmers into a new, industrial scale of production, and into farming one crop in particular: corn. US cattle were fattened by the immense increases in corn production. Burgers became bigger. Fries, fried in corn oil, became fattier. Corn became the engine for the massive surge in the quantities of cheaper food being supplied to American supermarkets: everything from cereals, to biscuits and flour found new uses for corn. As a result of Butz's free-market reforms, American farmers, almost overnight, went from parochial small-holders to multimillionaire businessmen with a global market. One Indiana farmer believes that America could have won the cold war by simply starving the Russians of corn. But instead they chose to make money.</p> <p>By the mid-70s, there was a surplus of corn. Butz flew to Japan to look into a scientific innovation that would change everything: the mass development of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/15/high-fructose-corn-syrup-rename\" title=\"\">high fructose corn syrup</a> (HFCS), or glucose-fructose syrup as it's often referred to in the UK, a highly sweet, gloppy syrup, produced from surplus corn, that was also incredibly cheap. HFCS had been discovered in the 50s, but it was only in the 70s that a process had been found to harness it for mass production. HFCS was soon pumped into every conceivable food: pizzas, coleslaw, meat. It provided that \"just baked\" sheen on bread and cakes, made everything sweeter, and extended shelf life from days to years. A silent revolution of the amount of sugar that was going into our bodies was taking place. In Britain, the food on our plates became pure science \u2013 each processed milligram tweaked and sweetened for maximum palatability. And the general public were clueless that these changes were taking place.</p> <p>There was one product in particular that it had a dramatic effect on \u2013 soft drinks. Hank Cardello, the former head of marketing at <a href=\"http://www.coca-cola.com/index.jsp\" title=\"\">Coca-Cola</a>, tells me that in 1984, Coke in the US swapped from sugar to HFCS (In the UK, it continued to use sugar). As a market leader, Coke's decision sent a message of endorsement to the rest of the industry, which quickly followed suit. There was \"no downside\" to HFCS, Cardello says. It was two-thirds the price of sugar, and even the risk of messing with the taste was a risk worth taking when you looked at the margin, especially as there were no apparent health risks. At that time, \"obesity wasn't even on the radar\" says Cardello.</p> <p>But another health issue was on the radar: heart disease, and in the mid-70s, a fierce debate was raging behind the closed doors of academia over what was causing it. An American nutritionist called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/08/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Ancel Keys</a> blamed fat, while a British researcher at the University of London <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Yudkin\" title=\"\">Professor John Yudkin</a>, blamed sugar. But Yudkin's work was rubbished by what many believe, including <a href=\"http://profiles.ucsf.edu/ProfileDetails.aspx?Person=5291002\" title=\"\">Professor Robert Lustig</a>, one of the world's leading endocrinologists, was a concerted campaign to discredit Yudkin. Much of the criticism came from fellow academics, whose research was aligning far more closely with the direction the food industry was intending to take. Yudkin's colleague at the time, <a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/research/personal/index?upi=KRBRU16\" title=\"\">Dr Richard Bruckdorfer at UCL</a> says: \"There was a huge lobby from [the food] industry, particularly from the sugar industry, and Yudkin complained bitterly that they were subverting some of his ideas.\" Yudkin was, Lustig says simply, \"thrown under the bus\", because there was a huge financial gain to be made by fingering fat, not sugar, as the culprit of heart disease.</p> <p>The food industry had its eyes on the creation of a new genre of food, something they knew the public would embrace with huge enthusiasm, believing it to be better for their health \u2013 \"low fat\". It promised an immense business opportunity forged from the potential disaster of heart disease. But, says Lustig, there was a problem. \"When you take the fat out of a recipe, food tastes like cardboard, and you need to replace it with something \u2013 that something being sugar.\"</p> <p>Overnight, new products arrived on the shelves that seemed too good to be true. Low-fat yoghurts, spreads, even desserts and biscuits. All with the fat taken out, and replaced with sugar. Britain was one of the most enthusiastic adopters of what food writer <a href=\"http://garytaubes.com/\" title=\"\">Gary Taubes</a>, author of Why We Get Fat, calls \"the low-fat dogma\", with sales rocketing.</p> <p>By the mid-80s, health experts such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/15/andrew-lansley-department-big-macs\" title=\"\">Professor Philip James</a>, a world-renowned British scientist who was one of the first to identify obesity as an issue, were noticing that <a href=\"http://www.theobesityepidemic.org/introduction/\" title=\"\">people were getting fatter</a> and no one could explain why. The food industry was keen to point out that individuals must be responsible for their own calorie consumption, but even those who exercised and ate low-fat products were gaining weight. In 1966 the proportion of people with a BMI of over 30 (classified as obese) was just 1.2% for men and 1.8% for women. By 1989 the figures had risen to 10.6% for men and 14.0% for women. And no one was joining the dots between HFCS and fat.</p> <p>Moreover, there was something else going on. The more sugar we ate, the more we wanted, and the hungrier we became. At New York University, <a href=\"http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/faculty/faculty_profile.jsp?faculty=376\" title=\"\">Professor Anthony Sclafani</a>, a nutritionist studying appetite and weight gain, noticed something strange about his lab rats. When they ate rat food, they put on weight normally. But when they ate processed food from a supermarket, they ballooned in a matter of days. Their appetite for sugary foods was insatiable: they just carried on eating.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://research.tu.edu/laboratories/schwarz/staff.html\" title=\"\">Professor Jean-Marc Schwarz</a> of San Francisco hospital, who is currently studying the precise way in which the major organs of the body metabolise sugar, this momentum creates \"a tsunami\" of sugar. The effect this has on different organs in the body is only now being understood by scientists. Around the liver, it coalesces as fat, leading to diseases such as type-2 diabetes. Other studies have found that sugar may even coat semen and result in obese men becoming less fertile. One researcher told me that, ultimately, perhaps nothing needs to be done about obesity, as obese people will wipe themselves out.</p> <p>The organ of most interest, however, is the gut. According to Schwarz and Sclafani, the gut is a highly complex nervous system. It is the body's \"second brain\", and this second brain becomes conditioned to wanting more sugar, sending messages back to the brain that are impossible to fight.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.sugar.org/\" title=\"\">Sugar Association</a> is keen to point out that sugar intake alone \"is not linked to any lifestyle disease\". But evidence to the contrary appears to be emerging. In February, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/01/tax-regulate-sugar-alcohol-tobacco\" title=\"\">Lustig, Laura Schmidt and Claire Brindis of the University of California wrote an opinion article for the journal Nature</a> citing the growing body of scientific evidence showing that fructose can trigger processes that lead to liver toxicity and a host of other chronic diseases, and in March, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/health/research/sugar-sweetened-drinks-linked-to-heart-disease.html\" title=\"\">the New York Times reported a study that had been published in the journal Circulation</a>, which found that men who drank sweetened beverages most often were 20% more likely to have had a heart attack than those who drank the least. <a href=\"http://www.theendofovereatingbook.com/\" title=\"\">David Kessler</a>, the former head of the US government's most powerful food agency, the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/\" title=\"\">FDA</a>, and the person responsible for introducing warnings on cigarette packets in the early 90s, believes that sugar, through its metabolisation by the gut and hence the brain, is extremely addictive, just like cigarettes or alcohol. He believes that sugar is hedonic \u2013 eating it is \"highly pleasurable. It gives you this momentary bliss. When you're eating food that is highly hedonic, it sort of takes over your brain.\"</p> <p>In London, <a href=\"http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/tony.goldstone/\" title=\"\">Dr Tony Goldstone</a> is mapping out the specific parts of the brain that are stimulated by this process. According to Goldstone, one of the by-products of obesity is that a hormone called <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/leptin\" title=\"\">leptin</a> ceases to work properly. Normally, leptin is produced by the body to tell you that you are full. However, in obese people, it becomes severely depleted, and it is thought that a high intake of sugar is a key reason. When the leptin doesn't work, your body simply doesn't realise you should stop eating.</p> <p>Leptin raises a big question: did the food industry knowingly create foods that were addictive, that would make you feel as though you were never satisfied and always wanted more? Kessler is cautious in his response: \"Did they understand the neuroscience? No. But they learned experientially what worked.\" This is highly controversial. If it could be proved that at that some point the food industry became aware of the long-term, detrimental effects their products were having on the public, and continued to develop and sell them, the scandal would rival that of what happened to the tobacco industry.</p> <p>The food industry's defence has always been that the science doesn't prove its culpability. <a href=\"http://www.ameribev.org/about-aba/board-of-directors/\" title=\"\">Susan Neely, president of the American Beverage Association</a>, a lobby group for the soft-drinks industry, says: \"there's a lot of work to try to establish causality, and I don't know that I've seen any study that does that.\" But it looks as though things might be changing. According to <a href=\"http://publichealth.yale.edu/people/kelly_brownell.profile\" title=\"\">Professor Kelly Brownell </a>at Yale University, one of the world's foremost experts on obesity and its causes, the science will soon be irrefutable and we may then be just a few years away from the first successful lawsuit.</p> <p>The relationship between the food industry and the scientists conducting research into obesity is also complicated by the issue of funding. There is not a great deal of money set aside for this work and so the food industry has become a vital source of income. But this means that the very same science going into combating obesity could also be used to hone the products that are making us obese. Many of the scientists I spoke to are wary about going on the record because they fear their funding will be taken away if they speak out.</p> <p>The relationship between government and the food industry is also far from straightforward. <a href=\"http://www.andrewlansley.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Health secretary Andrew Lansley</a> worked, until 2009, as a non-executive director of <a href=\"http://www.profero.com/\" title=\"\">Profero</a>, a marketing agency whose clients have included Pizza Hut, Mars and PepsiCo. In opposition, Lansley asked public health expert <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/researchintelligence/issue32/chd.htm\" title=\"\">Professor Simon Capewell</a> to contribute to future policy on obesity. Capewell was amazed at the degree to which the food industry was also being consulted: the equivalent, he says, \"of putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank\". Lansley has made no secret of his work for Profero, and denies a conflict of interest, saying that he did not work directly with the company's clients. And the government argues, not unreasonably, that it's essential to have the industry on board to get anything done. But the relationships are not always kept at arms length. Professor James was part of a <a href=\"http://www.who.int/en/\" title=\"\">WHO</a> committee to recommend global limits on sugar in 1990. As <a href=\"http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/who_trs_916.pdf\" title=\"\">the report</a> was being drafted, something extraordinary happened: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/usnews.food\" title=\"\">US secretary of state for health Tommy Thompson flew to Geneva to lobby on behalf of the sugar industry</a>. \"Those recommendations were never made,\" says James.</p> <p>In New York, Mayor Bloomberg is currently planning to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/31/soft-drink-obesity\" title=\"\">reduce soft drink super-sizing</a> while last week, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/former-coke-executive-slams-share-of-stomach-marketing-campaign/2012/06/07/gJQAKwgKMV_story.html\" title=\"\">a former executive at Coca-Cola Todd Putman</a> spoke publicly about the need for soft drink companies to move their focus to \"healthy products\". But it's not going to be easy to bring about change. A previous attempt to bring in a soda tax was stopped by intense lobbying on Capitol Hill. The soft-drinks industry paid for a new ward at Philadelphia Children's Hospital, and the tax went away. It was a children's obesity ward.</p> <p>Why has Kessler, when he has had such success with his warnings on cigarette packets, not done the same thing for processed foods high in sugar? Because, he tells me, when the warnings came in on cigarettes, the game was already up in the west for the tobacco industry. Their new markets were the far east, India and China. It was no concession at all. The food industry is a different matter. For one thing, the food lobby is more powerful than the tobacco lobby. The industry is tied into a complex matrix of other interests: drugs, chemicals, even dieting products. The panoply of satellite industries that make money from obesity means the food industry's relationship to obesity is an incredibly complex one.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/category/ministers/anne-milton/\" title=\"\">Anne Milton, the minister for public health</a>, tells me that legislation against the food industry isn't being ruled out, because of the escalating costs to the NHS. Previous governments have always taken the route of partnership. Why? Because the food industry provides hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in revenue. It is immensely powerful, and any politician who takes it on does so at their peril. \"Let's get one thing straight,\" Milton tells me, however. \"I am not scared of the food industry.\"</p> <p>And I believe her, because now, there is something far bigger to be frightened of.

      "bodyText": "Bailouts in the eurozone used to generate relief rallies that lasted at least a week. The Spanish version couldn't even manage a full morning. The yield on 10-year Spanish government debt, which had fallen to 6% soon after the start of trading, ended the day at 6.5% \u2013 an astonishing turnaround. Worse, Italian bonds followed the same pattern, closing a whisker above 6%, the highest since January. Far from calming nerves, the grant of \u20ac100bn (\u00a381bn) or so of cheap loans for Spanish banks seems only to have hardened investors' analysis that the eurozone debt crisis is getting worse. Perverse? No, the market's scepticism is understandable. The good news from the bailout is actually modest: Spanish banks, after an injection of capital, will be better equipped to absorb the tide of property-related losses that are heading their way. But the bad news is very significant: the Spanish government will have to stand behind the bailout and the addition of up to \u20ac100bn to the national debt will make the overall mountain Pyrenean in size if recession follows for another couple of years. On some estimates, Spain's debt-to-GDP ratio could approach 100%. If those numbers look frightening to would-be private-sector lenders, the confusion over the structure of the bailout makes matters worse. Will the cash for Spain's banking system come from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) or the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)? If it's the latter, then private sector holders of Spanish debt stand second in line in the pecking order \u2013 and, naturally, they will expect to be compensated for that additional risk in the form of a higher rate of interest on loans to Spain. European officials were briefing on Monday that the EFSF, where all lenders stand in the same queue, will be used. But we await official confirmation. And, frankly, it's quite amazing that the source of the funding for Spain was not specified in the first line of the weekend announcement. It looks as if eurozone leaders, in their rush to place some form of protection around Spain's banks before next weekend's general election in Greece, didn't have time to settle even basic details. Then there's the bigger unknown \u2013 how will other recipients of eurozone bailouts react to the perception that Spain is the beneficiary of soft conditions? Again, confusion reigns as to how soft the terms actually are. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy is keen to promote the idea that he's secured a bargain with no strings attached. On the other hand, the word from the European commission in Brussels is that strict supervision of already-agreed austerity measures will be imposed. The details of that little debate may prove academic: politicians in Dublin and Lisbon almost owe it to their electorates to push their luck and seek lower interest rates on their own bailout loans. Athens, of course, is a special case \u2013 whatever next weekend brings, it is hard to imagine Germany agreeing to make major concessions. The bottom-line on Spain, however, seems very simple: cheaper funding for the banks is helpful, but the country cannot afford to fund itself at 10-year interest rates of 6.5%. As long as those rates persist, the plot is heading towards a bigger bailout.",

      "bodyText": "The chairman of the New York Fed has defended the role on his board of embattled JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon. Lee Bollinger, chairman of Federal Reserve Bank of New York, defended Dimon on Monday ahead of a Congressional appearance on Wednesday where he will be grilled over the bank's recent $2bn plus trading loss and his role on the New York regulator. \"I do not think he should step down,\" Bollinger said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. He said critics attacking the Fed have a \"false understanding\" of how it works, and that it is \"foolish\" to say Dimon's presence on the New York Fed board creates an appearance of a conflict as the law requires bankers to serve on such boards. But Simon Johnson, professor of global economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, dismissed Bollinger's comments and said Dimon should step down immediately. \"I can tell you I don't have a false understanding of how it works,\" he said. \"Governance at the Federal Reserve was part of the way the system was mismanaged in the run up to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. I am concerned about continuing governance failures. This is an institutional problem, it's not about individuals but it is manifest in the form of individuals and their relationships.\" He pointed out that Dick Fuld, former Lehman boss, was a NY Fed board member until shortly before that bank's collapse. \"Nothing has changed and some things have got worse,\" he said.

    "webTitle": "Tesco UK sales fall for more than a year", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco has reported another quarter of falling sales in the UK after money-off coupons and a blitz on customer service failed to win back disgruntled shoppers. Like-for-like sales, excluding petrol and VAT, declined 1.5% in the 13 weeks to 26 May, which analysts said was \"disappointing\". It means Tesco's domestic chain has now posted six quarters of falling sales on that basis. Analysts were also alarmed by sharply slowing sales at the US chain Fresh &amp; Easy, which had growth of 3.6% compared with 12.3% in the previous quarter. At its annual results in April, Tesco's chief executive, Philip Clarke, announced a \u00a31bn makeover of the UK chain designed to \"put the heart and soul back into Tesco\" after domestic profits fell for the first time in more than 20 years. With more than 2,700 stores, Tesco's domestic chain pumps out two-thirds of the group's profits and Clarke admitted it had taken \"a little bit too much away from the shopper\" during years of penny-pinching to boost the bottom line. Clarke described the UK chain's performance as steady and improving \"relative to the market\". The fall in first-quarter sales was only marginally better than the previous quarter, when sales, on the same basis, fell 1.6%. It was early days in the turnaround, Clarke added, as he said \"very little of the \u00a31bn had been spent. Customers were responding to the changes being made in store, which include more staff manning its produce and wines and spirits aisles. \"Our customers are seeing the evidence of the changes we're making and they're telling us they like what they see,\" said Clarke. The retailer said it had hired 4,300 \u2013 including 500 in the last three weeks \u2013 of the 8,000 new staff it pledged to recruit in April with 100 stores refurbished since the start of the new year. Tesco's stores have been described as \"too industrial\" and the makeovers involve a rustic look with green paint job, wooden fittings and the smell of bread baking. Data from the research firm Kantar has shown the overall grocery market slowing as hard-up shoppers cut back their spending. \"Consumer confidence is not getting any worse but it is not getting any better,\" said Clarke, pointing to petrol prices that he said were putting an \"amazing dent\" in household budgets. \"Real incomes are not growing so they are having to be very careful with their budgets.\" To win shoppers, the major supermarket chains tried to outflank each other with money-off coupons, with Clarke describing the sales climate as \"very competitive\":. \"There was an unhelpful step-up in the market of this type of promotion,\" he said. \"We played our part and planned to.\" The country's jubilee celebrations provided some respite with the chain enjoying its biggest ever trading week outside Christmas, chalking up sales of more than \u00a31bn, although the holiday fell in its second quarter. Philip Dorgan, a Panmure Gordon analyst, said investors \"don't have to look very deeply into the numbers to see some disappointing sales growth (the UK, the US, the Bank), despite accelerating investment\". In 2008, Tesco bought out its financial services partner, Royal Bank of Scotland, but it has taken several years to transfer the accounts over to its own IT systems. All credit cards have now been moved over but the delay and a competitive car insurance market led to its sales falling 3.7%. Analysts had feared a repeat of January's shock profit warning as Tesco concentrated its efforts on the UK turnaround. But the retailer said: \"At this early stage of the year we are performing in line with market expectations for the group. The outlook for the year as a whole remains unchanged.\" Shares closed unchanged. Andrew Kasoulis, a Credit Suisse analyst, said: \"Importantly, Tesco has not warned [on profits]. Although it is still very early days in the recovery process, outlook is unchanged and we do not expect consensus to change.\" Clarke has already moved the break-even target for Fresh &amp; Easy breaks even from the current financial year to next year. He said the sales at the US chain were \"soft\" in March but had improved. Fresh &amp; Easy was a \"challenger brand\" that was having to broaden its appeal, he said, with major changes to its product range in the coming weeks. \"It would have been nice to have double-digit like-for-like sales growth,\" said Clarke, who added the US market remained \"very exciting for us\". \"The Tesco recovery story has got off to a slow start,\" said Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst. He added that the under-pressure chief executive had been \"hyperactive, with his sleeves rolled up sorting out the UK, as well as addressing problems elsewhere in the group\".",

      "body": "<p>Tesco has reported another quarter of falling sales in the UK after money-off coupons and a blitz on customer service failed to win back disgruntled shoppers.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales, excluding petrol and VAT, declined 1.5% in the 13 weeks to 26 &#xa0;May, which analysts said was \"disappointing\". It means Tesco's domestic chain has now posted six quarters of falling sales on that basis. Analysts were also alarmed by sharply slowing sales at the US chain Fresh &amp; Easy, which had growth of 3.6% compared with 12.3% in the previous quarter.</p> <p>At its annual results in April, Tesco's chief executive, Philip Clarke, announced a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/18/tesco-uk-profits-fall-makeover\" title=\"\"> \u00a31bn makeover</a> of the UK chain designed to \"put the heart and soul back into Tesco\" after domestic profits fell for the first time in more than 20 years. With more than 2,700 stores, Tesco's domestic chain pumps out two-thirds of the group's profits and Clarke admitted it had taken \"a little bit too much away from the shopper\" during years of penny-pinching to boost the bottom line.</p> <p>Clarke described the UK chain's performance as steady and improving \"relative to the market\".</p> <p>The fall in first-quarter sales was only marginally better than the previous quarter, when sales, on the same basis, fell 1.6%. It was early days in the turnaround, Clarke added, as he said \"very little of the \u00a31bn had been spent. Customers were responding to the changes being made in store, which include more staff manning its produce and wines and spirits aisles. \"Our customers are seeing the evidence of the changes we're making and they're telling us they like what they see,\" said Clarke.</p> <p>The retailer said it had hired 4,300 \u2013 including 500 in the last three weeks \u2013 of the 8,000 new staff it pledged to recruit in April with 100 stores refurbished since the start of the new year. Tesco's stores have been described as \"too industrial\" and the makeovers involve a rustic look with green paint job, wooden fittings and the smell of bread baking.</p> <p>Data from the research firm Kantar has shown the overall grocery market slowing as hard-up shoppers cut back their spending. \"Consumer confidence is not getting any worse but it is not getting any better,\" said Clarke, pointing to petrol prices that he said were putting an \"amazing dent\" in household budgets. \"Real incomes are not growing so they are having to be very careful with their budgets.\"</p> <p>To win shoppers, the major supermarket chains tried to outflank each other with money-off coupons, with Clarke describing the sales climate as \"very competitive\":. \"There was an unhelpful step-up in the market of this type of promotion,\" he said. \"We played our part and planned to.\"</p> <p>The country's jubilee celebrations provided some respite with the chain enjoying its biggest ever trading week outside Christmas, chalking up sales of more than \u00a31bn, although the holiday fell in its second quarter.</p> <p>Philip Dorgan, a Panmure Gordon analyst, said investors \"don't have to look very deeply into the numbers to see some disappointing sales growth (the UK, the US, the Bank), despite accelerating investment\". In 2008, Tesco bought out its financial services partner, Royal Bank of Scotland, but it has taken several years to transfer the accounts over to its own IT systems. All credit cards have now been moved over but the delay and a competitive car insurance market led to its sales falling 3.7%.</p> <p>Analysts had feared a repeat of January's shock profit warning as Tesco concentrated its efforts on the UK turnaround. But the retailer said: \"At this early stage of the year we are performing in line with market expectations for the group. The outlook for the year as a whole remains unchanged.\" Shares closed unchanged.</p> <p>Andrew Kasoulis, a Credit Suisse analyst, said: \"Importantly, Tesco has not warned [on profits]. Although it is still very early days in the recovery process, outlook is unchanged and we do not expect consensus to change.\"</p> <p>Clarke has already moved the break-even target for Fresh &amp; Easy breaks even from the current financial year to next year. He said the sales at the US chain were \"soft\" in March but had improved. Fresh &amp; Easy was a \"challenger brand\" that was having to broaden its appeal, he said, with major changes to its product range in the coming weeks. \"It would have been nice to have double-digit like-for-like sales growth,\" said Clarke, who added the US market remained \"very exciting for us\".</p> <p>\"The Tesco recovery story has got off to a slow start,\" said Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst. He added that the under-pressure chief executive had been \"hyperactive, with his sleeves rolled up sorting out the UK, as well as addressing problems elsewhere in the group\".</p>",

While Europe struggles, Asia-Pacific airlines continue to generate profits, albeit forecast at $2bn for 2012 compared with $4.9bn recorded in 2011. While official figures are not published, Chinese airlines are estimated to account for half of all global profits. Pearce struck a further note of caution for airlines in noting that \"asset utilisation\" \u2013 the number of passengers on planes \u2013 had remained generally high. However, a surge in new aircraft being delivered in the next 24 months could weaken what Iata describes as a key driver of profitability.

      "bodyText": "It's a bit rich for Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke to grumble about \"a significant amount of couponing activity\" in the UK supermarket sector given that he's responsible for a large chunk of it. As any holder of a Tesco Clubcard will know, money-off coupons have been showered on shoppers over the past couple of months. As a short-term strategy to stem the decline in market share in the UK and buy some time for Clarke's root-and-branch overhaul of the stores to be implemented, the plan seems to have enjoyed some success. A fall in like-for-like sales of 1.5% over the past 13 weeks isn't pretty but it's no worse than feared. But what will be the medium-term effect on profits and margins? It's impossible to tell at this stage. The real test for Clarke will arrive when he's spent his \u00a31bn in hiring more staff and revamping stores. At that point, he'll have to attempt to wean shoppers off the coupons and trust they keep coming. It's too early to guess at how that gamble will turn out. \"Our customers are seeing the evidence of the changes we're making and they're telling us they like what they see,\" said Clarke.

The real test for Clarke will arrive when he's spent his \u00a31bn in hiring more staff and revamping stores. At that point, he'll have to attempt to wean shoppers off the coupons and trust they keep coming. It's too early to guess at how that gamble will turn out. \"Our customers are seeing the evidence of the changes we're making and they're telling us they like what they see,\" said Clarke.

Flybe said on Monday that group revenues in the year to 31 March rose 3.3% to \u00a3678.8m but that was not enough to offset rising costs as the company posted an underlying pre-tax loss of \u00a37.1m compared with a profit of \u00a322.3m for the same period last year.</p> <p>Flybe's chairman and chief executive, Jim French, said the business remained in a \"challenging environment\". Although Flybe has diversified into the Scandinavian market through a joint-venture with Finnair, its overwhelming exposure is to the UK, where it has struggled to fill planes profitably on routes such as Southampton to Geneva.</p> <p>Although Flybe is much smaller than Ryanair and easyJet, it is the UK's largest domestic airline \u2013 partly a legacy of its acquisition of British Airways's regional business in 2006. Overall, passenger numbers rose 5.8% to 7.6 million.</p> <p>Flybe also used its statement to criticise government aviation policy. Next month the government will launch two policy documents: a consultation on establishing a sustainable aviation strategy; and a request for options on maintaining Britain's hub airport status.</p> <p>Private industry exasperation over the government's ban on runway expansion in south-east England has, over the past year, broken out into increasingly vociferous public criticism of the policy.</p> <p>Flybe said: \"At a time of economic difficulty, a lack of a coherent and comprehensive transport policy, combined with illogical hikes in stealth taxation on an industry critical to the country's economic prosperity, is having a detrimental impact on airlines such as Flybe and ultimately the prosperity of the UK's economic regions.\"</p> <p>Douglas McNeill, an analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said Flybe's first year as a listed business had been a disappointment, but said the results had not deepened its difficulties, with non-fuel costs rising by a respectable 3% \u2013 showing management was doing its best to mitigate a soft trading environment.</p> <p>\"The first full year post-IPO has been a disappointing one, with profit giving way to loss and return on capital nowhere near the group's cost of capital. However, underlying demand looks no weaker than we thought, and non-fuel costs are under tight control.\"</p>",

Flybe said on Monday that group revenues in the year to 31 March rose 3.3% to \u00a3678.8m but that was not enough to offset rising costs as the company posted an underlying pre-tax loss of \u00a37.1m compared with a profit of \u00a322.3m for the same period last year. Flybe's chairman and chief executive, Jim French, said the business remained in a \"challenging environment\". Although Flybe has diversified into the Scandinavian market through a joint-venture with Finnair, its overwhelming exposure is to the UK, where it has struggled to fill planes profitably on routes such as Southampton to Geneva. Although Flybe is much smaller than Ryanair and easyJet, it is the UK's largest domestic airline \u2013 partly a legacy of its acquisition of British Airways's regional business in 2006. Overall, passenger numbers rose 5.8% to 7.6 million. Flybe also used its statement to criticise government aviation policy. Next month the government will launch two policy documents: a consultation on establishing a sustainable aviation strategy; and a request for options on maintaining Britain's hub airport status. Private industry exasperation over the government's ban on runway expansion in south-east England has, over the past year, broken out into increasingly vociferous public criticism of the policy. Flybe said: \"At a time of economic difficulty, a lack of a coherent and comprehensive transport policy, combined with illogical hikes in stealth taxation on an industry critical to the country's economic prosperity, is having a detrimental impact on airlines such as Flybe and ultimately the prosperity of the UK's economic regions.\" Douglas McNeill, an analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said Flybe's first year as a listed business had been a disappointment, but said the results had not deepened its difficulties, with non-fuel costs rising by a respectable 3% \u2013 showing management was doing its best to mitigate a soft trading environment. \"The first full year post-IPO has been a disappointing one, with profit giving way to loss and return on capital nowhere near the group's cost of capital. However, underlying demand looks no weaker than we thought, and non-fuel costs are under tight control.\"",
