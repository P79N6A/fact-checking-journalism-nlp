      "bodyText": "Demand for summer clothes and tanning products during the sunniest April on record were not enough to stem a drop in retail sales last month as retailers suffered a post-Easter slowdown. Industry figures show that sales fell 2.4% on a like-for-like basis from April 2014, the weakest performance for three years. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said its figures were distorted by Easter falling earlier this year than last year and it sought to highlight a stronger underlying picture for sales than comparisons with April 2014 would suggest. Sales were up 0.6% on a year ago when averaged over the latest three months of February to April. That was slower than 1.3% growth in January to March \u2013 also distorted by an Easter bounce this March \u2013 but it beat the underlying sales performance seen throughout the second half of 2014. The BRC director general, Helen Dickinson, took the figures as a \u201cclear indication that confidence among consumers is slowly improving\u201d. She also highlighted the bright spots among last month\u2019s figures, including for clothing retailers helped by the sunniest April on record. \u201cApril witnessed a solid performance for fashion and beauty retailers; particularly welcome following a disappointing autumn/winter season,\u201d said Dickinson. Women\u2019s clothing was the best performing category and denims and blouses proved popular but dresses less so, the BRC said. The sunny weather also helped sales of sandals, canvas shoes and ballerina pumps as well as suncreams and tanning products. The latest figures showed that against the backdrop of a supermarket price war, food sales continued to fall on a like-for-like basis, which adjusts for the effect of new store openings. Food sales were down 1.6% in the three months to April compared with a year ago while non-food sales were up 2.3%. David McCorquodale, head of retail at the report\u2019s co-authors KPMG, said the industry would be scrutinising the new government. \u201cWith David Cameron firmly in place at No 10, retailers will be looking to ensure he fulfils his promise not to increase VAT and also to review business rates. It is also hoped that a stable government can allow consumer confidence to flourish,\u201d he said.",

Their Brussels correspondent, Efi Koutsokosta, flags up that they interviewed Yanis Varoufakis in Brussels: PS: Here\u2019s Ian Traynor and Helena Smith\u2019s news story on today\u2019s developments: All in all, today went about as well as we could expect. But there are still some major issues to resolve, and not much time to prevent the Greek debt crisis exploding. So, here\u2019s a quick recap, with links to the main points in the blog: Eurozone finance ministers have welcomed recent progress between Greece and her creditors, following a eurogroup meeting in Brussels, but also warned that \u201cmore time and effort are needed to bridge the gaps\u201d on remaining issues. Eurogroup statement on Greece European commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters that the two sides still haven\u2019t agreed on proposals for Greek pension and labour reform. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis also agreed that progress being made - mainly thanks to Greece - but ruled out implementing capital controls. He also warned that Greece\u2019s liquidity problem is a \u201cterribly urgent issue\u201d It\u2019s common knowledge, let\u2019s not beat around the bush....We are talking about the next couple of weeks.\u201d Earlier, Varoufakis had told reporters that a deal was close: We don\u2019t yet know whether enough progress has been achieved to persuade the European Central Bank to relax its restrictions on Greece. Greece has eased fears that it might default on its obligations to the International Monetary Fund, by announcing that it has already begun paying a \u20ac750m payment due tomorrow. But Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has stirred up the situation by suggesting Greece should hold a referendum over its bailout deal. Photos from today\u2019s eurogroup meeting are here. Teneo Intelligence predicted that a Greek deal would only come at the last minute. And UBS outlined four scenarios, including a full-blown default and Grexit. While in Greece, protesters took over Siemens headquarters in Athens.....and sacked cleaning ladies celebrated getting their jobs back. European ministers will be back in Brussels on Tuesday morning for an Ecofin meeting. I\u2019ll be back with the blog too. Goodnight, and thanks for all the comments. GW With no big breakthrough on Greece, our financial editor Nils Pratley is intrigued by Germany\u2019s suggestion that Athens holds a referendum. He writes: The late news from the make-or-break talks in Brussels was no news at all, really. There were a few encouraging words for the progress Greece is making on its reform plans. Athens also ordered a \u20ac750m (\u00a3535m) repayment to the International Monetary Fund. But an agreement on releasing \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds? No. There was, though, one intriguing sub-plot. Germany, in the form of finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, suddenly seems taken by the idea of Greece holding a referendum. \u201cIf the Greek government thinks it should have a referendum, then it should organise a referendum,\u201d said Sch\u00e4uble. \u201cMaybe this would be the right measure to let the Greek people decide if it is ready to accept what is necessary, or if they want to have the other thing.\u201d By the other thing, he means an exit from the euro.... More here: And finally, a question on whether Greece is considering implementing capital controls to prevent a bank run. Capital controls and a monetary union are incompatible, Varoufakis replies. We have no plans to bring them in. Today\u2019s meeting with my German counterpart was the best since I became finance minister, Varoufakis smiles: Varoufakis confirms that Greece will be meeting the IMF\u2019s \u20ac750m payment tomorrow. Won\u2019t you have to row back on some of the promises you made to get elected, to reach a deal with creditors? Of course! That was an easy question, Varoufakis says. We have compromised to a great extent already. And he reiterates that the debt deflationary cycle must be ended, which despite some \u2018touching rumours\u2019 didn\u2019t finish in 2014. And will the burden be transferred from the shoulders of the weakest, and onto those who helped caused the crisis? If that happens, we\u2019ll sign the deal. Varoufakis has also insisted that Greece is prepared to compromise on many issues. Some red lines remain, though: Is the Greek government considering a referendum over a bailout deal? That\u2019s a matter for the prime minister, the cabinet, and the president of the republic, Varoufakis replies. As finance minister, he can\u2019t answer it in any detail. Generally speaking, a referendum is always available\u2026.to elicit the support of the Greek people for pivotal issues. However: At the moment it is not on the radar screen as far as we are concerned. More key points from the Greek finance minister: Yanis Varoufakis concludes: The quest for an agreement that resolves the five, six year-old crisis of the Greek social economy is continuing. Agreement is getting closer, and the institutions, our partners, and representative of the Greek government continue to search for that solution in very good spirits. Yanis Varoufakis says that Greece and her creditors have made real progress in recent weeks. In recent weeks there has been considerable convergence, primarily due to our government\u2019s great efforts and major concessions during the Brussels Group negotiations. Unfortunately, agreement has not been reached as yet, he continues. But..... Today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting has acknowledged the strides we have made, and was conducted in a \u201cthoroughly positive atmosphere.\u201d Varoufakis also take a pop at elements of the media for their reporting of the alst eurogroup meeting, in late April. : Colleagues also condemned the awfully inaccurate and unhelpful supposed leaks that marred the aftermath of the previous eurogroup meeting in Riga. [that was the meeting where sources claimed that Varoufakis had been \u2018hammered\u2019 by fellow ministers] Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, is briefing the media now. There\u2019s a live feed here (you might need to click around to find the right part) So, in a nutshell, relations between Greece and its creditors are more constructive. But they have still not reached agreement on three crucial areas: And finally, Jeroen Dijsselbloem says the negotiations are working better since Greece shook up its technical teams, including changing how prime minister Tsipras is briefed. Give me two reasons why Greece will accelerate its work to meet its obligations in time... Dijsselblom replies that the Greek authorities will simply do what they have to do, put in all the effort needed, to reach a deal in time. And there\u2019s a lot of detailed work to do, given Athens will not accept the old reform programme. Dijsselbloem denies that the eurogroup is putting pressure on the European Central Bank to give Greece more help. The ECB is independent. Did the eurogroup discuss concerns that Greece might not be able to pay pensions and wages at the end of May? As time goes by, liquidity becomes worse, including for internal payments, Dijsselbloem replies. But it\u2019s primarily an issue for the Greek authorities. We can\u2019t manage the liquidity situation in Greece. Would bailout payments be delayed if Greece held a referendum? Presumably if you had a referendum you wouldn\u2019t start implementing reforms before you had the result. So there is a time delay there, Dijsselbloem says. Could bailout funds be paid in tranches? Dijsselbloem says it\u2019s possible that reforms could be cut into pieces, with disbursements being paid in stages too. But disbursements can\u2019t happen until reforms have been implemented. Can we have more details about the progress which has been achieved? I\u2019ve already given it, Moscovici hits back (see earlier post). Is the eurogroup concerned that the Athens parliament has approved legislation that unwinds recent austerity measures, including rehiring civil servants? The agreements of 20 February remain our roadmap, Moscovici replies, and that does not encourage \u2018unilateral\u2019 actions. But he won\u2019t go further.... Does Greece need a third bailout programme to cover its funding from the start of July, or could it get through the summer without one, if it receives the \u20ac7bn of outstanding bailout funds? Dijsselbloem reiterates that there is no point talking about a third programme for Greece until the existing programme has been concluded. Did Wolfgang Schauble propose a Greek referendum? Dijsselbloem declines to reveal details of the meeting, but explains that it\u2019s up to Greece whether or not to hold a referendum. Onto questions. How much time do we have left to resolve the Greece crisis and draw up a third programme, given the current programme ends on 30 June? Dijsselbloem jokes that he detects a bit of impatience. We can\u2019t discuss a third bailout until we have completed the current process. We need to have a positive review of this programme, to adjust the agreements. We\u2019re all committed to that. Klaus Regling also points out that Greece is already paying a low interest rate on its national debt, saving it over \u20ac8bn per year in interest payments. He says Athens made a small repayment to the EFSF today: That\u2019s important, Regling adds, as the legal impact of Greece missing a small payment is as serious as missing a big payment. Klaus Regling, head of the EFSF, also welcomes the progress made by Greece in recent weeks. Reminder: a fortnight ago, Athens reshuffled its negotiating team, to give more responsible to economist Euclid Tsakalotos, Greek deputy foreign minister. Moscovici adds that time is running out for Greece, given its bailout extension expires at the end of next month. Pierre Moscovici is now speaking (in French). He says there is good convergence between Greece and its creditors on some issues, such as VAT rates and how to handle non-performing loans. But there is still \u201csignificant divergence\u201d on other subjects, namely the Greek labour market and the pensions sector [as regular readers could have predicted] The eurogroup also discussed Ireland\u2019s strong economic performance. It is an example of how adjustment programmes (bailouts) can work if the government is fully committed, Dijsselbloem adds. No prizes for guessing who that comment was aimed at.... Reading between the lines, the Eurogroup appears to be urging the European Central bank to be patient and keep providing support to Greece\u2019s banks: We also discussed the latest EC economic forecasts, says Dijsselbloem. Growth is picking up across the continent, and more jobs are being created. But we cannot rely on cheap oil, a weaker euro and quantitative easing -- governments must implement structural, growth-friendly reforms. Dijsselbloem is reading out the statement on Greece - confirming that faster progress is being made....but more time is needed to reach a comprehensive agreement. The eurogroup welcomes Greece\u2019s commitment to accelerate the negotiations , he adds. And bailout money can\u2019t be released until Greece has agreed a comprehensive list of reforms, he adds (as we already knew, of course) Jeroen Dijsselbloem begins by paying tribute to Alexandre Lamfalussy, one of the Wise Men who laid the foundations for European monetary union, who has passed away. The press conference is starting now (reminder, there\u2019s a livefeed here) Here\u2019s the official statement, hot off the press (and then off Twitter) It\u2019s official: The eurogroup has officially \u2018welcomed\u2019 the progress made by Greece and its creditors in recent days. But, as sources predicted earlier, it has also called for more time and effort to fix the outstanding issues. Reporters in Brussels are scrambling to the press room.... Officials in Brussels are preparing the press conference room now. We\u2019ll be hearing from Eurogroup president Jeroen Dojsselbleom, and European commissioner Pierre Moscovici. Klaus Regling, who runs the European Financial Stability Fund (the main bailout vehicle) is also attending. It should be streamed live here. Still waiting for the eurogroup to wrap up..... Here\u2019s an odd curious development...Greece has been asked to join the club of BRICS countries represented by the New Development Bank, reports Helena Smith in Athens. Helena explains all: The Greek government has released a statement saying that the \u201csurprise\u201d offer was extended to prime minister Alexis Tsipras earlier today. Operated by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the New Development Bank is seen as an alternative to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It was set up to facilitate financial cooperation among the five emerging markets. \u201cGreece has been asked to become the sixth member of the BRICS Development Bank!\u201d a government non-paper said (complete with exclamation mark). The offer was made during a telephone conversation between Tsipras and the Bank\u2019s representative, Sergei Storchak who is also Russia\u2019s deputy finance minister. The statement said: \u201cThe prime minister thanked Mr Storchak, at the same time expressing his positive surprise at the invitation that Greece becomes the sixth member of the BRICS development bank,\u201d \u201cAlexis Tsipras conveyed Greece\u2019s interest and commitment to studying the proposal.\u201d The leader, it said, would also have the opportunity to discuss it with counterparts heading BRICS states when he attends an economic forum in St Petersburg between 18-20 June. Here\u2019s another photo, of Yanis Varoufakis chatting with Jeroen Dijsselbloem earlier today. Heads-up: the eurogroup meeting may end shortly, which means we may get that much-awaited statement on Greece. Plus a flurry of press conferences and briefings........ Greece has given its eurozone partners the good news: Greece will actually hand over the \u20ac750m to the IMF tomorrow, confirms Athens correspondent Helena Smith. Although the payment process is underway, the cash may not land in Washington until Tuesday.... Eurozone officials are more optimistic today than at previous meetings, flags up The Economist\u2019s Tom Nuttall. Shame it\u2019s taken more than three months.... Greece now has a little leeway until its next major IMF repayment, early next month. But before then, Athens must find the funds for another month of wage and pensions payments.... Another important development.... Officials in Brussels are briefing reporters that the eurogroup of finance ministers will issue a short statement tonight welcoming the progress that Greece has made. However, the statement will also warn that more effort is required to overcome the outstanding sticking points (such as pension and labour market reforms). Reuters has the details: \u201cThere will be a short statement and it will refer to the progress made and the work ahead, welcoming the Greek\u2019s intention to accelerate their work,\u201d said one official briefed on the statement. Another official said the statement will say that \u201cmore time and effort is needed to bridge the gaps\u201d in talks to avoid a Greek default. Tom Nuttall, who write The Economists\u2019 Charlemagne column, is feeling a little deflated.... Hat-tip to Reuters\u2019 Athens bureau: Greece\u2019s Athens News Agency has just confirmed that the order to hand over the \u20ac750m loan instalment to the IMF has been executed - backing up Reuters\u2019 report, writes Helena Smith in Athens. A case perhaps of the Greek government trying to make waves with a goodwill gesture - before the Euro Group releases its much-anticipated statement on the state of negotiations. Here\u2019s some reaction to the news that Greece has begun meeting tomorrow\u2019s repayment to the International Monetary Fund: It emerged last month that Greece has broached the idea of delaying a repayment, but was firmly rebuffed by Christine Lagarde. So, despite the cash crunch, Athens is still determined to preserve relations with the Fund. And here\u2019s the full story.... Greece has made a payment of about 750 million euros to the International Monetary Fund that falls due on Tuesday, two Greek finance ministry officials told Reuters on Monday. \u201cThe order to pay the IMF has been executed,\u201d a senior Greek finance ministry official told Reuters. Athens is close to running out of cash and there had been doubt about whether it could make the IMF payment. Newsflash from Athens. According to government officials, Greece has begun the process of repaying around \u20ac750m to the International Monetary Fund (due tomorrow). 15:31:04 - GREECE HAS EXECUTED ORDER FOR IMF PAYMENT OF ABOUT \u20ac750m DUE MAY 12 - GREEK FINANCE MINISTRY OFFICIALS Take a peek inside today\u2019s eurogroup meeting, as ministers chat before getting down to business (thanks to AP, EPA and AFP/Getty) Reminder: the talks between Greece and its creditors remain snagged on three major key points; reforming the pension system, shaking up the employment market (and keeping the minimum wage down), and selling off state assets. Reuters has published details of Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s suggestion that a Greek referendum could be \u2018helpful\u2019: Greek referendum on debt deal could be helpful - Sch\u00e4uble EU paymaster Germany said on Monday it could make sense for Greece to hold a referendum on painful economic reforms under negotiation with its creditors, changing tack as Berlin\u2019s own lawmakers bridle at further aid for Athens. Euro zone governments have previously opposed such a vote, saying there is no time and it could destabilise financial markets and trigger a run on struggling Greek banks. When former Prime Minister George Papandreou surprised EU partners by proposing a referendum in 2011 at the height of the euro zone debt crisis, he was summoned to emergency talks with leaders of France and Germany and told bluntly to drop the idea. But with Greece running out of money and desperate for a deal to avert a possible default and exit from the euro zone, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said securing public backing for the necessary sacrifices might be useful. A referendum could make it easier for leftist Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to climb down on election promises that are making a deal on economic reforms hard to achieve. \u201cIf the Greek government thinks it must hold a referendum, then let it hold a referendum,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said on arrival at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers. \u201cThat might even be a helpful measure for the Greek people to decide whether it is ready to accept what is necessary, or whether it wants something different.\u201d.... Sch\u00e4uble didn\u2019t say exactly what question Greeks would be asked to vote on; that would depend on the conclusions of the negotiations with creditors. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem is speaking to reporters now. He says he doesn\u2019t expect a Greek deal today; ministers will take stock of the situation. He also played down the idea that the European Central Bank could be bounced into allowing Greek banks to buy more Greek government debt: The gang\u2019s all here, some looking happier than others.... EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis has warned that time is running out for Greece, even though relations with creditors have improved since the showdown in Riga late last month. Debt campaigners are watching events in Brussels with alarm. Rather than haggling about how to loan Greece more money, the eurozone must accept that Greece\u2019s debt mountain is simply unsustainable, argues Sarah-Jayne Clifton, Director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign: \u201cThe Eurogroup should not be discussing more loans to Greece today, they should be agreeing how much debt they are going to cancel. The debt comes from loans to bailout irresponsible lending by European banks. These debts, now owed to the IMF, ECB and other European governments, should be cancelled, including the payment to the IMF this week. The money to do so should be recovered from the banks which benefitted from the bailout.\u201d Greece\u2019s optimism of an imminent deal wasn\u2019t exactly shared by other members of the Eurogroup. Bloomberg\u2019s eurozone economist Maxime Sbaihi sums up today\u2019s arrivals: Ireland\u2019s finance minster, Michael Noonan, believes Greece might get a \u2018positive\u2019 statement after today\u2019s meeting, but nothing more. Will it be positive enough to persuade the ECB to allow Greek banks to buy more Greek government debt? Unlikely... A clip of commissioner Pierre Moscovici arriving in Brussels has just been uploaded. He told reporters that he hopes today\u2019s meeting will show there is \u201cgood progress\u201d in the talks between the Greek authorities and its lenders. That process is already \u201cmore efficient\u201d. But there are still important gaps to fill, before an agreement can be reached \u201cin the weeks to come.\u201d (so, no suggestion of a deal in the coming days, as Yanis Varoufakis suggested a few minutes ago) Moscovici added that it\u2019s vital that today\u2019s meeting takes place in a better spirit than the last meeting in Riga, when finance ministers blasted Yanis Varoufakis for the lack of progress. It\u2019s the occasion for the Greek authorities to reassure their partners, to show their commitment to reach an agreement. Yanis Varoufakis has also told reporters that the International Monetary Fund wil get its \u20ac770m tomorrow: Germany\u2019s finance minister had retained his sense of humour..... While I was listening to Yanis Varoufakis, Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told reporters that Greece should hold a referendum if it wants. [there\u2019s a video clip here, in German] European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has also arrived at the Eurogroup meeting. He told reporters that today\u2019s meeting won\u2019t be \u201cconclusive\u201d, but Greece must show that it is serious about reaching a deal. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has just arrived in Brussels, and told reporters outside the meeting that he\u2019s confident of a deal within a few days. He took four questions, according to this video clip. Q: How are you feeling about the meeting today? YV: Very confident. We are going to have a good meeting. There is going to be a communique that establishes the progress we are making. And this will be a very good paving stone towards the final completion. Q: Might there be flexibility in your red lines, sir? YV: The red lines, by necessity, are inflexible. But our red lines and their red lines are such that there is common ground. Q: What\u2019s the time frame now? YV: In the next few days, I think. Q: What are you expecting from the ECB? YV: To do its job, like we have to do our jobs. Everyone has to do their jobs in the eurozone. And then he vanished inside: Just in - photos showing that protestors have occupied the offices of German engineering giant Siemens in Athens, and hung anti-austerity banners outside: (with thanks to university lecturer Spyros Gkelis) Elsewhere in Athens, the cleaning ladies who fought a 20-month campaign to win their jobs back have been celebrating after being reinstated. The cleaners have been reinstated as part of a wider plan to rehire thousands of workers who had been laid off under previous austerity measures. Elsewhere in Athens, former staff from the state broadcaster ERT have been protesting, demanding their jobs back immediately. Last week, MPs passed legislation to reopen ERT. Back in Greece, a group of protesters have occupied the headquarters of German multinational Siemens in Marousi, north Athens. The Enikos newspaper says: The protesters have raised a banner asking the Greek government to end all negotiations with the lenders regarding a Greek bailout. Just in: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. That means borrowing costs have been unchanged since March 2009. There\u2019s also no change to the Bank\u2019s QE programme, under which \u00a3375bn of money has been pumped into the economy. Today\u2019s announcement was delayed because of Thursday\u2019s general election. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister has tweeted, somewhat exasperatedly, that Greece knows what it needs do to to get bailout funds.... Today\u2019s hastily arranged meeting between finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and his German counterpart Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble could allow the two men to mend relations before the official event, insiders say. The fact they are meeting at all shows just how crucial today\u2019s Eurogroup is, as Helena Smith reports Athens: Given that there is absolutely no love lost between the two men, the fact they are meeting ahead of today\u2019s euro group should not be taken lightly. That is the message being conveyed here in Athens where insiders are also saying the hope is that Varoufakis will \u201cbreak the ice\u201d when he has his sit-down with Sch\u00e4uble. The two men have not held direct talks for months - with euro zone officials speaking of an almost total breakdown in contact between the politicians. As Europe\u2019s most vocal anti-austerian, the Greek finance minister is widely seen as Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s nemesis. Ratcheting up the pressure this morning Varoufakis said: \u201cthe Greek government has done whatever is humanly possible.\u201d An agreement was \u201cvisible,\u201d he said, but Athens\u2019 leftist-lead administration would not be giving its support to a deal that did not solve the big problems of Greece\u2019s austerity-fuelled economic nosedive: debt, unemployment and recession. Any deal between Greece and its creditors will come at the last minute, predicts Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence. He writes: In preparation of today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, the Greek cabinet had a long gathering followed by a convention of the ruling SYRIZA\u2019s political secretariat. None of the two gatherings yielded any specific outcomes; the government is going into this Eurogroup meeting in wait-and-see mode. However, it does seems that the cabinet had an intense debate on whether or not to pay the installment worth \u20ac770m due to the IMF on 12 May in case that the outcome of today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting is negative (i.e. no positive statement). It is clear that both within the cabinet and the party, a group exists advocating a hard line towards the creditors. Yet this does not seem to be Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 chosen path. But in the meantime, leaking noise about Greece\u2019s potential willingness to play hardball may help with domestic public opinion. A poll published on Sunday shows well the government\u2019s current conundrum: 65.9% of Greeks want a compromise with lenders, but at the same time, 56.7% say that the government should not give in on pensions and labor reform. It\u2019s not us, it\u2019s you..... Interesting.... the finance ministers of Greece and Germany are reportedly planning a face-to-face meeting before the meeting kicks off. Heads-up. The official Eurogroup \u2018doorstep\u2019 will take place at 2.45pm Brussels time, or 1.45pm BST (3.45pm for readers in Greece). That gives finance ministers an opportunity to throw some choice quotes to the ravenous Brussels press pack outside the meeting, as they arrive for the session. Spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides has denied that Athens could refuse to repay the IMF tomorrow, if today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting goes badly. 11-May-2015 10:48:32 - GREECE DOES NOT LINK LOOMING IMF PAYMENT WITH MONDAY\u2019S EUROGROUP OUTCOME- GOVT SPOKESMAN The Greek government is insisting that there is no Plan B over its bailout -- it wants to reach a deal that suits both sides. Spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides is also telling reporters that Athens wants the eurogroup to give it some credit today, for progress made towards a deal. Over in Greece, government insiders are already saying they are hoping an emergency eurogroup meeting will be held towards the end of May. May 25 is being suggested as a possible date, if this afternoon\u2019s meeting in Brussels is successful. Helena Smith reports from Athens: \u201cThis meeting has to be huge department from Riga,\u201d said one insider, referring to Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 disastrous encounter with his counterparts last month [where he was heavily criticised by the eurogroup]. \u201cWe are looking at an extraordinary euro group meeting being held on May 25 if things go well today.\u201d Officials have begun to acknowledge openly that the longer negotiations continue, the worse things become for the economy. Speaking to Kokkino radio earlier Varoufakis said a cash for reform deal was possible \u201cas long as there is the political desire [for one] from lenders.\u201d But Varoufakis insisted that the newly installed anti-austerity government would not agree to a deal that did not \u201cgive the prospect\u201d of exit from the crisis. Negotiations between Greece and her creditors are entering a \u201ccrucial phase\u201d, says Swiss bank UBS. In an analyst note released this morning, they say: The talks are overshadowed by a precarious fiscal situation, heavy debt redemptions, and concerns about the stability of the banking system. The time pressure is enormous: the stalled review of the current Troika programme has to be closed by end-June, and a follow-on programme would have to be in place soon after for Greece to manage very high debt service in July/August. Failure to reach a deal over the coming weeks would likely mean default and might put Greece on a slippery slope that could lead to Grexit. UBS also outlined four scenarios for Greece: In Scenario 1 \u2013 our base case scenario \u2013 the negotiations eventually end successfully and Greece stays in the Eurozone. In Scenario 2, Greece suffers default, but Grexit can still be avoided thanks to a belated deal. In Scenario 3, the talks break down, leading to default, the end of ECB liquidity provisions, and quick Grexit. In Scenario 4, the Greek government increasingly issues IOUs, which would become a parallel currency, but over time this still leads to default and Grexit. As negotiations continue, we will reassess the likelihood of the different scenarios and our judgement of the likely base-case scenario. More fighting talk from Athens: Today\u2019s eurogroup meeting will almost certainly define the Greek government\u2019s actions in the coming days, amid rumours that it could threaten not to make tomorrow\u2019s IMF repayment. Helena Smith reports from Athens: \u201cOur next moves will depend on today\u2019s developments,\u201d Syriza\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, Nikos Filis, told Mega TV this morning, adding that the government hopes that headway would be made in Brussels. But, he cautioned, much would also depend on how positive the statement released by Athens\u2019 euro zone partners would be. Filis said: \u201c[It depends] if it is a signal of crisis or a signal that we are a little before an agreement. We are at a very sensitive stage of the negotiations. Lenders have toughened [their stance]. They have put issues on the table that had been closed previously during negotiations, perhaps because they think they can pressure us like they did in the past.\u201d Party insiders are suggesting that the government may go so far as to threaten non-payment of tomorrow\u2019s \u20ac780m loan instalment to the IMF if the Eurogroup statement tonight is lukewarm. When asked whether tomorrow\u2019s debt repayment should be met Filis said: \u201cWe are in constant session [talking about it].\u201d ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny has already weighed in, saying Greece\u2019s financial problems are \u201cmuch more a political question than an economic question\u201d. Greece\u2019s hopes of a breakthough with the European Central Bank have been dashed, by the FT\u2019s Peter Speigel. He reports that eurozone insiders are not expecting a big breakthrough today: As flagged up earlier, Greece hopes that the eurogroup will declare that progress has been made. But even if there is a statement, it\u2019s not likely to be positive enough to give the ECB leeway to raise the limit on short-term Treasury bills (t-bills) that Greek banks can buy. Such a move would give Greece more flexibility to avert bankruptcy, but many on the ECB reckon Greek banks hold quite enough sovereign debt already. Investors are anxious about the \u20ac770m repayment which Greece is due to send the IMF tomorrow, says RBC\u2019s head of European rates strategy, Peter Schaffrik: \u201cThe crucial information that nobody seems to know is how much money do they have left.\u201d \u201cDefaulting on the IMF would have major ramifications and increase the chances of an exit.\u201d Greece is top of the agenda at today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, which kicks off in around five hour\u2019s time. Here\u2019s the official statement: Greece Ministers will continue the discussion on the situation in Greece. They will be briefed on the state of play in the ongoing discussions between the Greek authorities and the three institutions - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the list of reforms that the Greek government is expected to complete under the current agreement. The reform list is a necessary step to complete the ongoing review and thus unlock the payment of the remaining tranche of financial assistance. Eurozone ministers will also discuss Ireland\u2019s progress since exiting its own bailout at the end of 2013. The Greek stock market has dropped in early trading, as investors in Athens brace for little progress at today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting in Brussels. The main ATG index is down 2.4%, with the banking sector leading the fallers. Attica Bank tumbled 10%, followed by Piraeus Bank and Eurobank Ergasias. Here\u2019s the worst-performing shares in Athens this morning: Greek bonds are under pressure too, pushing up the yield on its two-year debt from 20.5% to 20.8%. France\u2019s finance minister then warned that it could take a \u201cfew more days or weeks\u201d to reach a deal between Greece and her creditors. Reuters has the story: Michel Sapin said he had no doubt \u200eon the political will on both sides and no worries over whether a deal would be reached eventually. He declined to say if the Eurogroup would agree a statement on Greece and also declined to give a new deadline on when a deal should be reached. \u200e\u201dThis remains a complex and delicate process,\u201d he told a news conference. \u201cThings are tense on the Greek side.\u201d The time simply isn\u2019t \u2018ripe\u2019 for a deal on Greece, says France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin. Speaking in Paris a few minutes ago, Sapin said that today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting will be \u201cimportant but not decisive.\u201d \u201cThings have progressed but are not ripe enough to allow to conclude.\u201d Reminder: Greece owes a lot of money to the International Monetary Fund over the next six weeks.... It also must find funds for wage and pension payments at the end of this month. The interminable Greek bailout drama is weighing on the financial markets today. The euro has dipped by 0.3% to $1.1171 against the US dollar, on fears that today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting will be a(nother) disappointment. And the main European stock markets also mostly in the red. The FTSE 100 is up, though, with mining stocks boosted by China\u2019s decision to cut interest rates yesterday. The Greek debt negotiations could be a key driver of market sentiment today, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets. He told clients: Greek officials have been preparing for today\u2019s Eurogroup summit in Brussels following a weekend of \u2018feverish\u2019 negotiations as the pressure mounts on Athens to take action to avoid defaulting on its debt. PM Tsipras\u2019s government is due to repay \u20ac750mn to the IMF on Tuesday this week. Eurogroup officials are concerned that a very real chance of Greece going bankrupt exists at the current time. Greece\u2019s top government ministers met yesterday to discuss their strategy ahead of today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. And the tone of the meeting was pretty robust, with Athens sticking to its \u2018red lines\u2019 on pension reforms, collective wage bargaining, and sales tax. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras told his ministers that he wants the eurogroup to acknowledge that a deal is coming closer, saying: \u201cWe want a clear confirmation of the progress that has been made. Another attendee told the Telegraph that Tsipras\u2019s government was refusing to cave in: \u201cWe have agreed on a tougher strategy to stop making compromises. We were unified and we have a spring our step once again.\u201d Our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper, has been interviewing people on Athens\u2019 Vouliagmeni beach (tough gig!), and found that many Greeks remain relaxed about the debt crisis. He writes: \u201cNothing will change this week,\u201d said Aris Karnachoritis confidently as the waitress handed out bottles of beer and frosted glasses to him and his friends. Constantinos Neocleous, sitting beside him at a table on the beach at Vouliagmeni near Athens, nodded in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s interests to have a crisis now,\u201d he said. Beyond the beach lay shallow waters of radiant turquoise. Children paddled. Teenagers romped. And from nearby, where a group of young men were playing beach tennis, came the comforting \u201cplock-plock\u201d sound of bat on ball. The talks between Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government and its creditors have dragged on for so long that it has become hard to believe there will ever be a decisive make-or-break juncture. And never has that been harder to believe than now, with the arrival of summer and the entrancing distractions it brings to a country like Greece.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new week, but the same old story. Eurozone finance ministers will be gathering in Brussels this afternoon to discuss the Greek debt crisis, as the risk of the country defaulting continue to rise. Today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting is the start of a very tense week for Greece; tomorrow, it is due to repay around \u20ac750m to the International Monetary Fund. Let\u2019s not pretend that a deal will come today; both sides have dampened expectations ahead of the talks: Athens\u2019 best hopes is that eurozone ministers agree that it is making progress towards an acceptable programme of economic reforms. That might then persuade the European Central Bank to throw Greece some slack, by allowing it to issue more short-term debt. But with Greece\u2019s government vowing to stick to its \u2018red lines\u2019 on issues such as labour reform and pensions, there\u2019s a risk of renewed deadlock at today\u2019s meeting. Officials spent last weekend locked in talks, in an effort to produce some progress for ministers to chew on. But Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, warned over the weekend that the situation could easily escalate. Sch\u00e4uble told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that: \u201cSuch processes also have irrational elements. Experiences elsewhere in the world have shown that a country can suddenly slide into insolvency.\u201d Also coming up.....the Bank of England will announce its decision on interest rates at lunchtime, and also consider whether to alter it \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme. This meeting has been delayed from last week, because of the General Election. We confidently expect a chorus of \u2018no change\u2019 at noon. Today\u2019s Agenda: Bank of England interest rate decision: noon BST Eurogroup meeting: From 2pm BST Eurogroup press conferences: Evening (perhaps 6pm BST?) I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The late news from the make-or-break talks in Brussels was no news at all, really. There were a few encouraging words for the progress Greece is making on its reform plans. Athens also ordered a \u20ac750m (\u00a3535m) repayment to the International Monetary Fund. But an agreement on releasing \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds? No. There was, though, one intriguing subplot. Germany, in the form of finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, suddenly seems taken by the idea of Greece holding a referendum. \u201cIf the Greek government thinks it should have a referendum, then it should organise a referendum,\u201d said Sch\u00e4uble. \u201cMaybe this would be the right measure to let the Greek people decide if it is ready to accept what is necessary or if they want to have the other thing.\u201d By the other thing, he means an exit from the euro. In one sense, Berlin and Brussels\u2019 sudden conversion to a plebiscite is surprising. When a former Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, suggested holding a referendum in 2011 he was summoned to Brussels and told to drop the idea sharpish. Asking the people to decide was deemed far too dangerous. So what\u2019s Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s game? Depressingly for Athens, the moral seems clear: a referendum no longer carries the same fear for Germany. Berlin thinks it holds a winning hand whatever happens. If Greeks voted to stay in the euro, Berlin could claim democratic legitimacy for a tough reform programme encompassing pensions, tax, wages and privatisations. If Greece said no, then at least there would be resolution. Germany is perhaps being optimistic in believing the market fallout from Grexit would be minimal, but that is what its leading politicians believe. They are happy to take their chances. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s lack of concern about a referendum also sends another message to Athens as the talks enter the final round: he is telling Alexis Tsipras, the current Greek prime minister, that he is desperately short of time and running out of options. Greece needs \u20ac7.2bn to be released from the last bailout and then requires agreement on a fresh funding programme; and it needs it all to happen by the end of next month. In the delay caused by calling a vote, there could be a run on Greek banks, which might bring Grexit closer anyway. It is ridiculous that three months of talks have been characterised by brinkmanship on both sides. With Greek\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio now at 180%, it is also absurd that nobody, apart from the IMF, is talking about the possibility of debt relief. But the cold reality is that brinkmanship always favoured the creditors. Tsipras and his Syriza government now have only a few weeks to agree a deal. There are no guarantees, but it is still odds-on that Greece will capitulate. Whistl stop Moya Greene has got her orchard back. The chief executive of Royal Mail has complained bitterly for the past year about the \u201ccherry-picking\u201d activities of Whistl in the door-to-door delivery market. Now Whistl, the odd name for the former TNT in the UK, has decided the door-to-door game isn\u2019t worth playing anyway. Strictly speaking, Whistl is merely \u201creviewing\u201d its future in the so-called end-to-end market. But since it has suspended operations during the review, a pull-out looks inevitable. It can stick to the safer strategy of pre-sorting letters and using Royal Mail\u2019s network for delivery to the door. Whistl\u2019s original plans envisaged serving 42% of UK postal address, which, Greene grumbled, equated to only 8% of the land mass. Her point was that Royal Mail, under its universal service obligation, is not allowed to focus solely on densely populated areas such as London and Manchester but must also labour up hill and down dale. Regulators at Ofcom never seem impressed by her complaints. So a Whistl withdrawal would be a double boost. It was unexpected until a couple of weeks ago and it will deter other operators from trying their luck in the end-to-end market. No wonder Royal Mail\u2019s share price has risen 10% since Whistl\u2019s difficulties in securing investment to fund growth became apparent. Royal Mail has bigger headaches, it should be said. The letters market is still in decline and the parcels market looks over-supplied. But a large competitor\u2019s exit from household deliveries is a reminder of how hard an incumbent can be to shift. Heathrow obsession Welcome to the job of business secretary, Sajid Javid. Your first task, as big business sees life, is to ensure that a new runway is ordered in the south-east. And, if the Airports Commission says Heathrow is the best place, the business lobby wants you to do your duty. One slice of the Conservative party is secretly praying that the commission opts for Gatwick in the summer. It seems unlikely. If it\u2019s Heathrow, Javid will be expected to go to war with recalcitrant cabinet colleagues. It\u2019s that simple. Aside from the EU referendum, the boardrooms of big companies are obsessed with Heathrow.",

      "bodyText": "Move over Mo\u00ebt, bye-bye Bollinger. The march of English sparkling wine from a mouth-puckering novelty to a player on the burgeoning global market for premium fizz has taken a further step forward with a boom in production. Burgeoning demand for brands such as Nyetimber and Ridgeview is turning parts of the South Downs and beyond into an English \u00c9pernay after a doubling of the amount of land in England devoted to vineyards in the last seven years and a 43% rise last year in wine production. Whereas bubbly alcohol in Britain was once the preserve of cider makers, premium English sparkling wine has long been seen as on a par with top champagnes. But now there is evidence that the critical success is leading to a sharp rise in production. Final figures for the 2014 harvest from the Food Standards Agency reveal that a record-breaking 47,433 hectolitres of English sparkling and still wine \u2013 the equivalent of 6.3m bottles \u2013 has been made, smashing the previous record of 2013 when nearly 4.5m bottles rolled off the production line. According to trade bodies, at least two-thirds of English output is sparkling wine, suggesting that about 4m bottles of bubbly have been made this year. However, the UK\u2019s love of French sparkling wine still dominates these domestic upstarts, with Britain importing 32.7m bottles of champagne worth more than \u00a3340m last year, making it the world\u2019s second-largest champagne market outside France. English wine producers have struggled in the past with an inconsistent climate and higher production costs than continental rivals. But last year domestic vineyards enjoyed a long, warm spring and summer, bringing high-quality grapes in large volumes. Stephen Skelton, a wine growing consultant, said: \u201cThe last two years have provided excellent growing conditions for our grapes \u2013 great flowering weather and a warm summer. The vineyards have produced some very good quality grapes and volumes of still and sparkling wines.\u201d Julia Trustram Eve, marketing director of the English Wine Producers trade body, said the emboldened industry would target more overseas markets. \u201cEnglish wines really are on an upward trajectory. As volumes continue to grow, so will our efforts to develop markets both here and abroad.\u201d The UK wine region has doubled in seven years and now stands in excess of 2,000 hectares, with most planted with grapes for sparkling wine. According to the UK Vineyards Association, there are now 470 vineyards in England and Wales. Significantly the average size of a vineyard is the highest ever, reflecting the industry\u2019s growing commercial success. English or Welsh wine is made from fresh grapes grown domestically, not imported. A consortium of Sussex wine producers has become the first in the UK to submit a bid for \u201cprotected designation of origin\u201d. If approved, that means Sussex wine would be elevated to the ranks of other protected British products, which include Arbroath smokies, Cornish clotted cream and stilton cheese, which have to meet tough taste and production criteria. Production of sparkling wines has increased by nearly 150% in the last five years and more is coming on to the market, from established producers whose products have clinched top international awards to new English wine brands, the industry claims. The latest entrant is luxury retailer Harvey Nichols, which has joined forces with award-winning wine-makers Digby Fine English to launch its first own label English sparkling wine this month. Such is the confidence in its own-brand bubbly that Harvey Nichols delves into the baroque lexicon of wine lingo for the product description, describing an \u201cattractive citrus and white stone fruit aroma\u201d that is a \u201crewarding partner to seafood\u201d. Supermarkets are reporting strong sales of English wines, which were once maligned on grounds of taste and cost. Sales in 2014 were worth an estimated \u00a378m, with many domestic supermarkets routinely stocking a range of English still and sparkling wines. Marks &amp; Spencer has just added significantly to its range, introducing wines from vineyards across the UK and recently launching its first Welsh wine, the Tintern Parva bacchus from Parva Farm Vineyards in Monmouthshire. Waitrose, which stocks more than 100 English and Welsh wines, has reported a 177% increase in sales of domestic brands over the past year. Waitrose\u2019s English wine buyer, Rebecca Hull, said there was \u201creal momentum\u201d in the English wine industry. \u201cThe success of English wine is a culmination of dedication and effort from some talented winemakers across the country who have gradually built the reputation of our wines from the ground up.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece moved to banish fears it was on the brink of insolvency and default on Monday, ordering the repayment of \u20ac750m (\u00a3535m) in IMF loans hours before they were due. The payment \u2013 timed in a calculated gesture to coincide with the latest exercise in brinkmanship with eurozone creditors in Brussels \u2013 came as a relief, though not as a surprise, to senior eurozone officials. Eurogroup finance ministers met their Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis, in Brussels for the latest round in more than three months of talks, but there was no breakthrough and the session was relatively brief. \u201cMore time is needed to bridge the remaining gaps,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and president of the Eurogroup. Athens would make the \u20ac750m payment to the International Monetary Fund easily, said a senior eurozone official. He also played down any substantive progress in the talks that aim to trade economic and fiscal reforms on the Greek side for the release of a final \u20ac7.2bn in bailout funds that Athens will need desperately to meet billions in payments to its EU creditors between now and August. The leftwing government of Alexis Tsipras insisted on changing the terms of the bailout and so it had to deliver \u201cdetailed proposals and detailed calculations\u201d, said Dijsselbloem. \u201cA comprehensive and detailed list of reforms is needed for a successful conclusion \u2026 before any disbursement of funds.\u201d Dijsselbloem\u2019s low-key remarks reflected the acute lack of progress being made in the Greek crisis, with little change since February when Tsipras and Greece\u2019s creditors agreed to extend the bailout while awaiting his proposals. Warning that the \u201cliquidity issue\u201d was urgent, Varoufakis said recent weeks had seen \u201cconsiderable convergence, primarily due to our government\u2019s great efforts and major concessions\u201d. But he added that responsibility for the crisis facing Greece had to be \u201cmoved to the shoulders of those who helped cause it\u201d, who he said were currently unburdened. Greek finance ministry officials confirmed that the general state accountancy office had been instructed to make the IMF transaction with immediate effect. Athens had not been expected to meet the debt obligation until Tuesday, had previously asked the fund for a delay, and had set rumours circulating on Sunday that it would stall on the payment. With both sides locked in a pattern of contrasting narratives and spin, Athens and the eurozone appeared to be talking past one another. There was no sign of the Europeans softening the conditions for disbursing the money and just as little evidence of Greece coming up with detailed plans that would satisfy its lenders. The four-month extension of the bailout, agreed in February, expires at the end of next month, meaning that the negotiators need to strike a deal by the end of this month. Dijsselbloem indicated that there was no positive statement from the meeting that would signal to the European Central Bank it could lift the cap on Greek commercial bank lending to the government, money that is believed to be keeping the government afloat and enabling it to pay bills and salaries. \u201cWe don\u2019t manage the liquidity situation in Athens,\u201d said Dijsselbloem. The mood in Brussels was glum and resigned after months of flaring tempers and exasperation. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the influential German finance minister who warned at the weekend that countries can \u201csuddenly go insolvent\u201d, conceded that Tsipras could stage a referendum on the bailout if he wanted. The last attempt to hold a popular vote on the issue in Greece, in 2012, horrified eurozone leaders and brought down the government of George Papandreou. Tsipras has warned that he might order a plebiscite if there is no deal with the eurozone that he can stomach. All the polling evidence suggests the Greeks would vote to stay in the euro, meaning they would have to accept the eurozone\u2019s terms. That mandate could allow Tsipras to bypass the anti-austerity hardliners in his governing Syriza movement without surrendering power. \u201cIf the Greek government thinks it should have a referendum, then it should organise a referendum,\u201d said Sch\u00e4uble. \u201cMaybe this would be the right measure to let the Greek people decide if it is ready to accept what is necessary, or if they want to have the other thing [eurozone exit].\u201d While a pro-euro national vote could enable Tsipras to make concessions to the eurozone without losing face, it would also be a big gamble. It would take time that Greece cannot afford, and risk chaos. With talks at such a sensitive stage, analysts warned that a plebiscite would hold inherent dangers. \u201cHolding a referendum is in itself a challenge given that Greece will still have payment obligations while the referendum is being finalised,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an Athens-based economics analyst. \u201cEuropean creditors and the IMF will be highly reluctant to make any financial commitments to Greece before the outcome of a referendum has become clear and binding.\u201d The talks are stuck over pension and labour market reform and privatisation, with the Tsipras government reluctant to lower the costs of the pensions system, cut the minimum wage or reform the collective bargaining system. It is also stalling on promises from the previous government on privatisation.",

      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog has intervened in Greene King\u2019s proposed \u00a3774m takeover of rival Spirit Pub Company, raising the prospect of a full-blown investigation which is likely to lead to the brewer selling off some pubs. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said about one-third of the companies\u2019 combined 3,000 pubs overlapped in some way, with 16 locations in particular where minimal competition existed. The CMA concluded that competition could be damaged by the merger, potentially leading to higher prices or poorer customer service. The CMA has given Greene King five days to address its concerns. Changes are likely to include selling off pubs but could also feature changes to opening hours. The watchdog did not say where the pubs overlapped, how big the local areas were or how many pubs were involved. Sheldon Mills, the CMA senior director of mergers, said: \u201cOverall, we did not find major concerns with this transaction, given that most of the parties\u2019 pubs face local competition from national pub chains or independent rivals. \u201cIn a small number of areas, we found that after the merger the parties would operate pubs in close proximity without facing sufficient competition from rivals and we are concerned this could lead to a rise in the price of food or drink or a reduction in the quality of those pubs.\u201d Greene King, which brews Old Speckled Hen and Abbott Ale and operates chains such as Hungry Horse and Loch Fyne, said it intended to offer concessions to meet CMA concerns. Rooney Anand, Greene King\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis is a sensible decision by the CMA, reflecting a small number of local areas where competition may be diminished as a result of our acquisition of Spirit. We are confident we will be able to offer suitable undertakings, which will keep the number of pubs we need to sell to a minimum and allow the acquisition to complete before the end of June.\u201d The companies agreed to the takeover in November after lengthy talks to create Britain\u2019s biggest managed pub business. Greene King wooed Spirit in an attempt to expand in London and south-east England, where people have more money to spend on drinking and eating out. Greene King also hopes to save \u00a330m a year in costs. The brewer has 1,900 pubs and restaurants, while Spirit has 1,200 outlets. The combined businesses employ 40,000 people. Greg Johnson, an analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital, said: \u201cWe thought there would be some local markets, as the CMA refer to them, that would come under scrutiny. [Greene King] are keen to close [the deal]. They\u2019ve put a lot of time and effort into it. The issue was always going to be how many pubs they would have to sell.\u201d The companies extended the planned completion date to the end of June. Johnson said this suggested they expected to get round CMA objections and avoid an in-depth \u201cphase 2\u201d investigation. The CMA ruling follows another high-profile intervention, in which it subjected Poundland to phase-2 scrutiny of its takeover of 99p Stores.",

We are confident we will be able to offer suitable undertakings, which will keep the number of pubs we need to sell to a minimum and allow the acquisition to complete before the end of June.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/04/spirit-pubs-agrees-greene-king-takeover\">The companies agreed to the takeover</a> in November after lengthy talks to create Britain\u2019s biggest managed pub business. Greene King wooed Spirit in an attempt to expand in London and south-east England, where people have more money to spend on drinking and eating out. Greene King also hopes to save \u00a330m a year in costs. The brewer has 1,900 pubs and restaurants, while Spirit has 1,200 outlets. The combined businesses employ 40,000 people. <br></p> <p>Greg Johnson, an analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital, said: \u201cWe thought there would be some local markets, as the CMA refer to them, that would come under scrutiny. [Greene King] are keen to close [the deal]. They\u2019ve put a lot of time and effort into it. The issue was always going to be how many pubs they would have to sell.\u201d</p> <p>The companies extended the planned completion date to the end of June. Johnson said this suggested they expected to get round CMA objections and avoid an in-depth \u201cphase 2\u201d investigation.</p> <p>The CMA ruling follows another high-profile intervention, in which it subjected Poundland to phase-2 scrutiny of its takeover of 99p Stores. </p>",
