      "bodyText": "The British arm of Japanese car maker Nissan increased annual profits last year ahead of warnings by senior executives that the Brexit vote could undermine its business and put investment plans in jeopardy. Nissan\u2019s British subsidiary, which is centred around its Sunderland car factory, reported a jump in pre-tax profits of 21% to \u00a3117m for the 12 months to the end of March. The car maker sought and won assurances from Theresa May that the government would seek tariff-free access for the car industry in talks with the European Union once article 50 talks begin next April. But Greg Clark, the business secretary, has refused to give details of the meetings with Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn, sparking criticism that the company secured a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d. It is not known whether Nissan revealed \u201cin talks with Clark\u201d that, while its profits increased, revenues dropped by 1.4% to \u00a35.19bn and production fell by 3,000 vehicles to 478,000. Nissan said it had been \u201canother year of very strong production for the Sunderland site\u201d, which is due to build the new Qashqai and X-Trail models at the plant following the government\u2019s assurances. Nissan\u2019s Sunderland site, which exports more than 80% of its production, is Britain\u2019s biggest car factory and the company has about 7,500 UK employees. Like the rest of Britain\u2019s car industry, Nissan has voiced concerns that quitting the EU\u2019s single market will lead to higher tariffs on cars and crippling regulations that raise the cost of exporting its vehicles. The company warned \u201cany substantive change to the trading arrangements between the UK and the rest of the world could limit the company\u2019s competitiveness\u201d. They also expressed concerns over higher employment costs, \u201cwhich given the size of our workforce, could have an adverse effect on the company\u201d. The concerns come as Nissan, its parent company Renault and Mitsubishi Motors prepare to combine their electric vehicle investments in an effort to slash prices down to levels comparable to conventional gasoline cars, according to the Nikkei newspaper. Auto giants Volkswagen and Toyota are also aiming to mass-produce battery electric vehicles amid tightening emissions and fuel-economy regulations around the world. Renault and Nissan have been among the most vocal proponents of the zero-emission technology but have struggled to lower costs enough as they developed their electric cars separately. The Nikkei said Renault and Mitsubishi, which recently came under Nissan\u2019s control, will use the same vehicle platform as Nissan\u2019s remodelled Leaf electric car, which is expected to go on sale around 2018. The three companies will share key components such as the motor, inverter and battery, a move that would lower the Leaf\u2019s price by about a fifth, the paper said, without citing its sources.",

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s industrial spokesperson has called for the algorithms used by technology firms to be made transparent and subject to regulation, as the party prepares the new year launch of its industrial strategy consultation. Shadow minister Chi Onwurah wants to see greater scrutiny of the mathematical formulas that now control everything from the tailored news served to Facebook members to the speed at which workers are required to move around an Amazon warehouse. \u201cAlgorithms aren\u2019t above the law,\u201d Onwurah warned this weekend. In a telephone interview on Sunday, she said: \u201cThe outcomes of algorithms are regulated \u2013 the companies which use them have to meet employment law and competition law. The question is, how do we make that regulation effective when we can\u2019t see the algorithm?\u201d Labour\u2019s industrial paper, due to be published after the Christmas break, will call for suggestions on how tech firms could be more closely supervised by government. \u201cWe expect algorithms and data rights to be considered as part of that consultation,\u201d said Onwurah, who was shadow digital economy minister before taking on the industrial brief. \u201cAlgorithms are part of our world, so they are subject to regulation, but because they are not transparent, it\u2019s difficult to regulate them effectively.\u201d The business models of technology firms are increasingly being challenged by lawmakers. Google\u2019s shopping and advertising services are under investigation by the European commission, while Uber drivers won a landmark case at a London tribunal this autumn to be considered as employees of the ride-hailing app, and therefore entitled to a minimum wage and holiday pay. The equations behind the operations of digital businesses are a closely guarded trade secret. Any suggestion that they might have to hand them over to government agencies is likely to trigger a major pushback from silicon valley, where many of the biggest names are headquartered. Some commentators have compared forcing Google to share its search algorithm to ordering Coca-Cola disclose the secret recipe behind its best selling fizzy drink. But pressure for reform is mounting. Social media platforms are being blamed for allowing the spread of misinformation and online abuse, conditions which some argue are fueling the resurgence of extreme politics in America and western Europe. There are also signs that Google pages are being distorted by the spread of unchecked hate speech. Many search results are now reinforcing extreme views, with articles denying the holocaust or disparaging women increasingly appearing at the top of the rankings. Facebook has swung between relying entirely on maths and employing humans as well as software to weed out fake news, pornography and extremist propaganda. \u201cIf people were falling very ill after drinking Coca-Cola, the company would have some duty to share what could be causing that,\u201d said Onwurah, a chartered engineer who built telecoms networks before entering parliament. \u201cGoogle and others argue their results are a mirror to society, not their responsibility,\u201d she wrote in a letter published Sunday. \u201cGoogle, Facebook and Uber need to take responsibility for the unintended consequences of the algorithms and machine learning that drive their profits. They can bring huge benefits and great apps, but we need a tech-savvy government to minimise the downside by opening up algorithms to regulation as well as legislating for greater consumer ownership of data and control of the advertising revenue it generates.\u201d She has raised concerns about Google being given access to NHS patient data. Its British subsidiary DeepMind, which specialises in machine learning, has signed an agreement with the Royal Free Hospital in north London to develop an app that will warn doctors when patients are at risk of acute kidney injury. Junior health minister Nicola Blackwood revealed, in response to parliamentary questions, that the government had not been shown the details of the agreement or discussed it with the hospital. \u201cLabour is having to raise the debate because the government is years behind on this and refuses to face up to the challenges of the digital era,\u201d Onwurah said. The government says it is introducing greater protection for consumers and in particular for children online. The digital economy bill, which is awaiting approval from the House of Lords, is designed to ensure that websites that allow children to access pornographic content will be blocked.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Directors of a crashed company have been given the go-ahead to pursue a case for unfair dismissal in a landmark ruling against a business controlled by the former health secretary Stephen Dorrell. The tribunal ruling allows employees of an insolvent company to sue a business allegedly born out of the ashes of the one that employed them and where there is \u201ccommonality of ownership\u201d between the two. After several attacks on employment protections by recent governments, lawyers said the surprise ruling could potentially pave the way for a landmark legal decision for corporate insolvencies. Dorrell, who remains a senior figure in the health sector as chairman of the employers\u2019 lobby group, the NHS Confederation, is accused of using a controversial insolvency procedure to move the assets of a publishing company into a new corporate entity owned by himself. The insolvency made shares owned by Dorrell\u2019s business partners worthless and thwarted their unfair dismissal claim against the company. After hearing the claim, the employment judge ruled that Dorrell\u2019s new company \u2013 Pixel West \u2013 must face the unfair dismissal claim instead. Matti Rogers and his wife, Kate, who brought the claim, said they were delighted by the decision at the West Midlands employment tribunal in Birmingham. The unfair dismissal hearing will take place in May. They allege they were removed from the publishing company, called Project Viva, through a \u201csham redundancy exercise\u201d that paved the way for Dorrell to then transfer assets out of the business. The insolvency procedure used by Dorrell \u2013 a pre-pack administration \u2013 is lawful but controversial, because it allows a company in effect to walk away from its debts. However, this ruling shows that the new company can be made liable for the liabilities of the old company. The judge said there was \u201ccommonality of ownership and directorship between the companies so this [action] was hardly out of the blue\u201d. Dorrell was health secretary between 1995 and 1997 in John Major\u2019s administration and served as a Conservative MP for 36 years until he stood down at the last election. Project Viva, which published specialist health and motoring magazines, called in administrators in March and was immediately bought by Dorrell\u2019s investment vehicle, Dorson Transform, through a pre-pack administration. Project Viva was 35% owned by Dorrell\u2019s wife, 30% owned by financier Paul Meier, and 35% by Kate Rogers, whose husband Matti, a publisher, helped to set up the business. Matti Rogers claims he and Kate were pushed out of their roles at the company last summer after opposing Dorrell\u2019s proposals to take over Project Viva. Dorrell said their positions had been made redundant. Rogers and his wife then launched the unfair dismissal case against Project Viva, but the company was placed into administration just weeks before the hearing. The new hearing in Birmingham took place after Rogers applied for Pixel West to be added to the claim. This is not the first time that Dorrell has been caught up in controversy. His behaviour was branded \u201ccompletely immoral\u201d seven years ago after a South African company was left with worthless paper shares after selling Dorrell its UK clothing business. LA Group sold its clothing operations for \u00a31m of shares in Wensum, a company chaired by Dorrell and in which he had a large stake. However, a month after the deal the assets of Wensum were moved into a new business through a pre-pack administration. While LA Group ended up with nothing, Dorrell had a 15% stake in the new business and collected a \u00a3200,000 salary as a director. Dorrell said at the time he acted in good faith and denied that the acquisition of A&amp;D was part of a pre-arranged plan designed to boost Wensum\u2019s assets before it became insolvent. He also faced calls to resign as an MP in 2014 after taking on a lucrative role as a health consultant with KPMG, the accountancy firm. Critics claimed it was a conflict of interests because KPMG was looking at bidding for a \u00a31bn contract with the NHS. Dorrell\u2019s behaviour also drew criticism from staff at Project Viva. An editor of one the magazines it published, Andy Hornsby, sent an email to suppliers and customers after the pre-pack administration to say he was leaving the company. In the email, seen by the Guardian, Hornsby wrote: \u201cI really should try to write it as a script for a sitcom, except a lot of the stuff between the lines is frankly too implausible.\u201d In another email directly to Dorrell, the former health secretary is told that the reason for the pre-pack administration is morally objectionable. Dorrell told the Guardian earlier this year that Project Viva was placed into administration \u201cbecause the board concluded that it was unable to meet its obligations\u201d. In relation to the ruling this month, Dorrell said: \u201cThe tribunal ruled as it ruled and the issue will be dealt with in the normal way.\u201d Dorrell said that Pixel West is trading normally. Mark Gray, senior employment lawyer for Harrison Clark Rickerbys, which represented Rogers, said: \u201cThe case throws up interesting legal issues for both employers and employees. It demonstrates that the TUPE [employment protection] regulations can still potentially have teeth, despite what was seen by many as a watering down of employment laws in 2013. Businesses need to be very aware that employment laws still protect employees in a variety of situations and that TUPE laws may generally remain far-reaching.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Charles Dickens was outraged by child labour and for good reason: he had first hand experience of working long hours for little pay in bad conditions. By the time Dickens came to chronicle his childhood experiences during the 1820s in David Copperfield, the first steps had been taken to end the exploitation of children by unscrupulous employers. There was a parliamentary inquiry in 1832 followed by legislation the following year so that a child working in a textile mill could work no more than an eight-hour day. That was almost two centuries ago, yet in parts of the world child labour is still rife. There has been much discussion during 2016 about the effects of globalisation, almost all of it focused on problems it has caused for those struggling in developed countries. But globalisation is a two-way street. At one end there\u2019s the factory worker thrown on the scrapheap because it is cheaper to outsource production to a low-wage country. At the other there are workers making the trainers and the T-shirts. And many of them are children who should be playing with toys rather than making them. In the west, a company would never survive the public opprobrium following revelations that children as young as 10 were working 45-hour weeks. Multinational corporations know that consumers are not especially keen on child exploitation in developing countries either, so many of them have signed codes of practice designed to ensure that children are not going through the sort of experiences suffered by Dickens in the 1820s. That, though, is the reality according to a new report that looks at the link between child labour and education in the slums of one city \u2013 Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The findings are worrying. Bangladesh has a good record on human development. Poverty levels have fallen and it is close to getting every child in primary school. It has taken steps to achieve gender equity. Put simply, plenty of countries could learn some lessons from Bangladesh. But the report written by Maria Quattri and Kevin Watkins for the UK thinktank, the Overseas Development Institute, found that child labour was rife in the slums, in part because families were desperate for the extra income their children were bringing in and in part because the poor quality of education meant dropout rates were high. Dhaka is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing mega cities. Migration from rural areas to the cities has been a big part of Bangladesh\u2019s economic development, but urbanisation has been accompanied by rapid growth in slums. The ODI study looked at slums in eight of Dhaka\u2019s administrative units drawing on a large sample of 2,700 households in which children as well as adults took part. It found a high incidence of children working from the ages of six to 14, with an average rate of 15% from across the eight survey sites. Another 15% were neither in school nor working. The overwhelming majority of working children were out of the school. There are globally agreed rules drawn up by a UN body, the International Labour Organisation, governing the employment of children, and these make a distinction between child work and child labour. Convention 138 allows children from the age of 13 (12 in the poorest countries) to do light work provided it doesn\u2019t affect their attendance at school. Light work means work that is not hazardous \u2013 such as working down a mine, on a construction site or operating a machine in a factory \u2013 up to a maximum of 14 hours a week. Writing in the Observer, a group of academics voiced opposition to calls from the UN for tougher action to stop children working, saying that the focus should instead be to avoid dangerous occupations and exploitation. But the ODI study revealed that almost all the working children in the Dhaka slums were involved in what the ILO would classify as child labour, with hazardous work featuring prominently. Almost all were working more than 42 hours a week, with child labour levels rising steadily from 8% at the age of 10 to 45% by 14. Two-thirds of girl child labourers were employed making clothes, a big export earner for Bangladesh, which has an estimated 7,000 garment factories, employing about 5 million workers. Some of these are direct suppliers for foreign brands. They tend to be the bigger operations, but they sub-contract work to a large \u2013 less well policed \u2013 informal sector. \u201cWe do not state outright that named foreign brands can be linked to factories employing child labour,\u201d the ODI report says. \u201cHowever, it stretches credibility to assume that the supply chains for these brands do not include significant employment of child labourers. \u201cFirst, with over 60% of working girls and 13% of working boys reporting employment in the garment sector, this is the single largest source of employment in our sample. Second, the operations of direct and indirect exporters, and formal and informal suppliers, are deeply integrated. Widespread sub-contracting renders it highly probable that children are producing clothing destined for international supply chains.\u201d Children are driven into work by necessity. Poor families send their sons and daughters out to work to make ends meet: the survey found that the wages earned by children equalise the average incomes of households with and without working children. The ODI report found that children are entering the labour market having had on average four years of schooling, typically of a poor quality. Basic literacy and numeracy skills are low, meaning that the children who drop out of school are on course for a life in lowly-paid jobs. There are obvious ways of tackling child labour in Dhaka\u2019s slums. The government could provide more effective enforcement to ensure compulsory primary education. It could raise its spending on education from 3% of national output, a level well below that in sub-Saharan Africa. It could raise the school leaving age. It could introduce a system of cash transfers that would compensate households for the foregone wages of their children, which average $47 a month for those aged six to 14. One thing is certain: Bangladesh will pay a price if it fails to crack down on child labour. It is recognised that having a well-educated workforce is vital for economic development, which is why the UN has made universal secondary education one of its sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030. This won\u2019t happen in Bangladesh (and plenty of other countries) without a stronger commitment to eradicating child labour, which in turn means free, compulsory education for those aged six to 14.

      "body": "<p>Charles Dickens was outraged by child labour and for good reason: he had first hand experience of working long hours for little pay in bad conditions.</p> <p>By the time Dickens came to chronicle his childhood experiences during the 1820s in David Copperfield, the first steps had been taken to end the exploitation of children by unscrupulous employers. There was a parliamentary inquiry in 1832 followed by legislation the following year so that a child working in a textile mill could work no more than an eight-hour day.</p> <p>That was almost two centuries ago, yet in parts of the world child labour is still rife. There has been much discussion during 2016 about the effects of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/globalisation\">globalisation,</a> almost all of it focused on problems it has caused for those struggling in developed countries.</p> <p>But globalisation is a two-way street. At one end there\u2019s the factory worker thrown on the scrapheap because it is cheaper to outsource production to a low-wage country. At the other there are workers making the trainers and the T-shirts. And many of them are children who should be playing with toys rather than making them. In the west, a company would never survive the public opprobrium following revelations that children as young as 10 were working 45-hour weeks.</p> <p>Multinational corporations know that consumers are not especially keen on child exploitation in developing countries either, so many of them have signed codes of practice designed to ensure that children are not going through the sort of experiences suffered by Dickens in the 1820s.</p> <p>That, though, is the reality according to a new report that looks at the link between child labour and education in the slums of one city \u2013 Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The findings are worrying.</p> <p>Bangladesh has a good record on human development. Poverty levels have fallen and it is close to getting every child in primary school. It has taken steps to achieve gender equity. Put simply, plenty of countries could learn some lessons from Bangladesh.<br></p> <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/publications/10654-child-labour-and-education-survey-slum-settlements-dhaka\">report written by Maria Quattri and Kevin Watkins for the UK thinktank, the Overseas Development Institute</a>, found that child labour was rife in the slums, in part because families were desperate for the extra income their children were bringing in and in part because the poor quality of education meant dropout rates were high.<br></p> <p>Dhaka is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing mega cities. Migration from rural areas to the cities has been a big part of Bangladesh\u2019s economic development, but urbanisation has been accompanied by rapid growth in slums.<br></p> <p>The ODI study looked at slums in eight of Dhaka\u2019s administrative units drawing on a large sample of 2,700 households in which children as well as adults took part.</p> <p>It found a high incidence of children working from the ages of six to 14, with an average rate of 15% from across the eight survey sites. Another 15% were neither in school nor working. The overwhelming majority of working children were out of the school.</p> <p>There are globally agreed rules drawn up by a UN body, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm\">International Labour Organisation</a>, governing the employment of children, and these make a distinction between child work and child labour.</p> <p>Convention 138 allows children from the age of 13 (12 in the poorest countries) to do light work provided it doesn\u2019t affect their attendance at school. Light work means work that is not hazardous \u2013 such as working down a mine, on a construction site or operating a machine in a factory \u2013 up to a maximum of 14 hours a week.</p> <p>Writing in the Observer, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/18/child-labour-un-ban-damaging-mistake\">a group of academics voiced opposition</a> to calls from the UN for tougher action to stop children working, saying that the focus should instead be to avoid dangerous occupations and exploitation.</p> <p>But the ODI study revealed that almost all the working children in the Dhaka slums were involved in what the ILO would classify as child labour, with hazardous work featuring prominently. Almost all were working more than 42 hours a week, with child labour levels rising steadily from 8% at the age of 10 to 45% by 14. Two-thirds of girl child labourers were employed making clothes, a big export earner for Bangladesh, which has an estimated 7,000 garment factories, employing about 5 million workers. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Some of these are direct suppliers for foreign brands. They tend to be the bigger operations, but they sub-contract work to a large \u2013 less well policed \u2013 informal sector. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cWe do not state outright that named foreign brands can be linked to factories employing child labour,\u201d the ODI report says. \u201cHowever, it stretches credibility to assume that the supply chains for these brands do not include significant employment of child labourers.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, with over 60% of working girls and 13% of working boys reporting employment in the garment sector, this is the single largest source of employment in our sample. Second, the operations of direct and indirect exporters, and formal and informal suppliers, are deeply integrated. Widespread sub-contracting renders it highly probable that children are producing clothing destined for international supply chains.\u201d</p> <p>Children are driven into work by necessity. Poor families send their sons and daughters out to work to make ends meet: the survey found that the wages earned by children equalise the average incomes of households with and without working children.</p> <p>The ODI report found that children are entering the labour market having had on average four years of schooling, typically of a poor quality. Basic literacy and numeracy skills are low, meaning that the children who drop out of school are on course for a life in lowly-paid jobs.</p> <p>There are obvious ways of tackling child labour in Dhaka\u2019s slums. The government could provide more effective enforcement to ensure compulsory primary education. It could raise its spending on education from 3% of national output, a level well below that in sub-Saharan Africa. It could raise the school leaving age. It could introduce a system of cash transfers that would compensate households for the foregone wages of their children, which average $47 a month for those aged six to 14.</p> <p>One thing is certain: Bangladesh will pay a price if it fails to crack down on child labour. It is recognised that having a well-educated workforce is vital for economic development, which is why the UN has made universal secondary education one of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/sustainable-development-goals\">sustainable development goals </a>to be achieved by 2030. This won\u2019t happen in Bangladesh (and plenty of other countries) without a stronger commitment to eradicating child labour, which in turn means free, compulsory education for those aged six to 14.</p> <p>It might also be time for western companies, governments and consumers to ask themselves a simple question: if child labour was wrong in the London of the 1820s, what makes it right in the Dhaka of the 2010s?<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

    "webTitle": "Savers are slowly choking off the life of the world economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Saving is always said to be a good thing. Not a week passes without a central bank governor or finance minister telling us we don\u2019t save enough. But they are talking about households and their spare cash. And cash accounts for only a small proportion of the savings held by most people. These days our accumulated wealth is our savings \u2013 and far from being a way to protect us from financial shocks, they are toxic and slowly killing the world\u2019s economies. Firstly there is the sheer scale of savings held by individuals, companies and governments. Earlier this year the International Monetary Fund felt the need to add it all up and declared it a savings glut. It says institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds, along with the sovereign wealth funds of oil-rich nations and central banks, hold around $100 trillion in assets under management. This huge sum compares to US GDP of around $18 trillion and the total market value of US-listed companies in 2015 of $19 trillion (which today is more like $25 trillion). Mostly it is invested in stock markets and property or lent to companies and governments in the form of bonds. The remainder is invested in commodities such as oil, or financial derivatives of various assets and insurance products that hedge any potential losses on those assets. The unprecedented size of these savings might not matter if investors only wanted a modest return. Unfortunately investors are greedy and there are simply not enough things to invest in that can offer the high returns they demand. So how do investors react? For decades, they have bullied governments to release assets for sale that can then be leased back at high returns. In the UK, this is why we have privatised utilities and a swath of other safe, previously state-owned, assets in private hands. Then there is the way most people, businesses and governments have accumulated their savings. Just a quick look at the $100tn total and we can see that most of it is the result of tax avoidance. The Japanese are famous for their savings and investments. But middle-income families can only save because they don\u2019t pay enough tax for officials in Tokyo to provide basic services. Every year the Japanese government runs a 10% budget deficit, such that its accumulated debt is worth almost 250% of GDP. The same tax shortfall plays havoc with the UK\u2019s finances, though on a smaller scale. Voters who tend to be older, own a home and have a pension \u2013 many of whom are also investors \u2013 have voted to pay less and less tax since the 1980s. Privatisations brought in cash to make up some of the gap, but that hasn\u2019t been enough. Successive governments have funded capital projects off the balance sheet through vehicles like the private finance initiative, which were another way for investors to extract an income. Why pay tax, voters asked themselves, when you can keep the money and earn a return by lending it to the government (or fleecing the government by investing in a private contractor with a state contract)? The next thing that makes savings toxic is the way investors have bullied governments into making them safe. It could have been argued 20 years ago that most of the funds in the IMF\u2019s $100tn were in fact risky investments and totally different from bank savings. But in the last two decades, and especially since the 2008 crash, investments have been considered almost as safe as a regulated deposit. Property is protected from any significant devaluation by ultra-low interest rates. Regulators might argue that mortgage lenders can fail under the new post-crash regime. But such is the importance of property wealth to consumer confidence that politicians have made it clear prices must be protected to prevent a more general economic meltdown. The protection offered to the stock market is illustrated by Janet Yellen, the boss of the US Federal Reserve, who said last year that the threat of a stock market slump was a key factor in the central bank keeping interest rates at historical lows. Now she is raising them, but only in tiny increments and only because the arrival of Donald Trump and his promise of a government-funded spending spree offers a bigger payday than ultra-cheap central bank money.

      "body": "<p>Saving is always said to be a good thing. Not a week passes without a central bank governor or finance minister telling us we don\u2019t save enough.</p> <p>But they are talking about households and their spare cash. And cash accounts for only a small proportion of the savings held by most people.</p> <p>These days our accumulated wealth is our savings \u2013 and far from being a way to protect us from financial shocks, they are toxic and slowly killing the world\u2019s economies.</p> <p>Firstly there is the sheer scale of savings held by individuals, companies and governments. Earlier this year the International Monetary Fund felt the need to add it all up and <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp1618.pdf\" title=\"\">declared it a savings glut</a>.</p> <p>It says institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds, along with the sovereign wealth funds of oil-rich nations and central banks, hold around $100 trillion in assets under management.</p> <p>This huge sum compares to US GDP of around $18 trillion and the total market value of US-listed companies in 2015 of $19 trillion (which today is more like $25 trillion).</p> <p>Mostly it is invested in stock markets and property or lent to companies and governments in the form of bonds. The remainder is invested in commodities such as oil, or financial derivatives of various assets and insurance products that hedge any potential losses on those assets.</p> <p>The unprecedented size of these savings might not matter if investors only wanted a modest return. Unfortunately investors are greedy and there are simply not enough things to invest in that can offer the high returns they demand.</p> <p>So how do investors react? For decades, they have bullied governments to release assets for sale that can then be leased back at high returns. In the UK, this is why we have privatised utilities and a swath of other safe, previously state-owned, assets in private hands.</p> <p>Then there is the way most people, businesses and governments have accumulated their savings. Just a quick look at the $100tn total and we can see that most of it is the result of tax avoidance.</p> <p>The Japanese are famous for their savings and investments. But middle-income families can only save because they don\u2019t pay enough tax for officials in Tokyo to provide basic services. Every year the Japanese government runs a 10% budget deficit, such that its accumulated debt is worth almost 250% of GDP.</p> <p>The same tax shortfall plays havoc with the UK\u2019s finances, though on a smaller scale. Voters who tend to be older, own a home and have a pension \u2013 many of whom are also investors \u2013 have voted to pay less and less tax since the 1980s.</p> <p>Privatisations brought in cash to make up some of the gap, but that hasn\u2019t been enough. Successive governments have funded capital projects off the balance sheet through vehicles like the private finance initiative, which were another way for investors to extract an income.</p> <p>Why pay tax, voters asked themselves, when you can keep the money and earn a return by lending it to the government (or fleecing the government by investing in a private contractor with a state contract)?</p> <p>The next thing that makes savings toxic is the way investors have bullied governments into making them safe.</p> <p>It could have been argued 20 years ago that most of the funds in the IMF\u2019s $100tn were in fact risky investments and totally different from bank savings. But in the last two decades, and especially since the 2008 crash, investments have been considered almost as safe as a regulated deposit.</p> <p>Property is protected from any significant devaluation by ultra-low interest rates. Regulators might argue that mortgage lenders can fail under the new post-crash regime. But such is the importance of property wealth to consumer confidence that politicians have made it clear prices must be protected to prevent a more general economic meltdown.</p> <p>The protection offered to the stock market is illustrated by Janet Yellen, the boss of the US Federal Reserve, who said last year that the threat of a stock market slump was a key factor in the central bank keeping interest rates at historical lows.</p> <p>Now she is raising them, but only in tiny increments and only because the arrival of Donald Trump and his promise of a government-funded spending spree offers a bigger payday than ultra-cheap central bank money.</p> <p>Pension funds are another element of the $100tn that see themselves as benign if not beneficial. Yet a large proportion of saving is only in the pension ledger after avoiding a 20% \u2013 or more likely 40% \u2013 tax rate.</p> <p>If these savers had paid tax first and then saved from their net income, governments would have enough money to provide services without the need for extra borrowing.</p> <p>The IMF says governments should work harder to attract investor funds to build vital infrastructure and close their budget deficits.</p> <p>But when investment banks demand between 10% and 15% returns and pension funds think we should be grateful they only want 6% to 9%, the IMF is supporting a rip-off perpetrated by today\u2019s savers on tomorrow\u2019s taxpayers.

      "bodyText": "Has anyone in Downing Street actually realised that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has lodged a bid for Sky? If you trawl through newspapers and the internet looking for comments from the government about the proposed \u00a311.7bn deal, you will not find much. Matt Hancock, the junior culture minister, appeared in the Commons to answer an urgent question from Labour on the matter early last week, and that was it. \u201cAny transaction will be looked at on its merits, on a case-by-case basis,\u201d he said. How insightful. Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark, the business secretary, have been silent on the matter. Karen Bradley, Hancock\u2019s boss and the culture, media and sport secretary, was apparently unavailable to answer the urgent question in parliament. This all rather surprising when you consider that other investments in the UK from other overseas companies since the vote to leave the European Union have led to swift comments from the prime minister and chancellor praising their commitment to the country. The boss of Softbank, the Japanese company that bought technology group Arm for \u00a324bn, even posed for photos with Hammond outside 11 Downing Street. Now, the government\u2019s silence on this issue may be because Sky shareholders have yet to vote on the proposal, or because it wants to leave the matter to Ofcom and other regulators. Hancock told MPs that the government must be \u201cscrupulously fair and impartial\u201d and that Bradley\u2019s role is \u201ca quasi-judicial one and it\u2019s important she acts independently and is not subject to improper influence\u201d. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the government before. Softbank\u2019s trip to Whitehall came on the day its bid was revealed, before the shareholder vote and before any regulator had cast an eye over the transaction. Instead, the government\u2019s silence looks like an attempt to distance itself from the Sky deal and depoliticise it. May has not even made a clear, public pledge to properly analyse the transaction. In contrast, Gordon Brown, Vince Cable, Tom Watson and plenty of other politicians outside government have had lots to say about the proposal \u2013 mainly that May must ensure that Ofcom conducts a public-interest test on the deal, seriously consider whether the Murdochs are fit and proper people to control Sky and its news operations, or even simply block the proposal. The government\u2019s silence is further evidence that the deal could be railroaded through by 21st Century Fox and Sky before any opposition is allowed to build up a head of steam. Supporters of the takeover claim that much has changed since Murdoch last tried to buy Sky in 2011. His business has been split in two, with newspaper brands such as the Sun and the Times held within News Corp and the TV and film assets run through Fox. Also, Google and Facebook now dominate the digital advertising market, transforming the outlook for news and content providers. But both of these defences are easily dismantled. Firstly, splitting News Corp and Fox does not change the fact that one family could end up with extraordinary influence over British media. Take a look at the boards of News Corp and Fox \u2013 Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are the co-chairs of both, while James Murdoch is chief executive of Fox, on the board of News Corp, and chair of Sky. Secondly, recent changes in the media industry simply reinforce the importance of the established news providers emphasising their independence, credibility and quality. If the public question the veracity of what they read in newspapers or see on TV news, then it simply pushes more people to Facebook, Google and fake news. The government must not sleepwalk its way through this issue. The Fox-Sky deal must be rigorously tested, and the Murdochs should be called to appear in front of MPs to make guarantees about the future of the brands they could control. A short-term boost for US In the weeks since the US presidential election, financial markets have had a change of heart about Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton. The knee-jerk reaction when the result came in was to assume the worst. Trump\u2019s programme was sketchy but seemed worrisome. He was threatening to get tough with China. He talked about protectionism. He had made minatory noises about the Federal Reserve. Put simply, Trump meant uncertainty, so markets sold off. This mood did not last long. Wall Street bulls quickly discovered a silver lining: Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes and increase spending on America\u2019s creaking infrastructure. Dealers in New York think looser fiscal policy means stronger US growth, which in turn will lead to higher profits for companies quoted on Wall Street. Hence the surge in the Dow towards the 20,000 mark. The upbeat mood was only briefly interrupted by the Fed\u2019s interest-rate announcement last week. Wall Street quickly shrugged off the quarter-point rise in borrowing costs and the indication that 2017 would see three further increases. There were two main reasons for this. First, recent form suggests the Fed might not go ahead with next year\u2019s monetary tightening. When it raised rates a year ago, it hinted at four increases in 2016. Only one was actually delivered: the one last week. Second, Wall Street thinks that even if the Fed does go ahead, the economic impact will be modest. In the short term, at least, both assumptions seem reasonable. The Fed is certainly not trigger-happy when it comes to rates and Trump\u2019s fiscal policy should guarantee growth next year. But investors need to be wary. Most of the fiscal boost is going to come through tax cuts, which will inject both demand and inflation into an economy already running up against capacity constraints. At some point in 2017 the Fed will adopt a more aggressive stance. Shares will suffer as the economy slows down. Tech v Trump? Could be interesting Rarely can so much wealth and power have gathered around one table. In a meeting at Trump Tower last week the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, held talks with a group of technology bosses that included Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google\u2019s owner Alphabet, and Elon Musk of Tesla. The executives left claiming it had gone well: Bezos even said he was \u201csuper-excited\u201d about the prospect of working with an \u201cinnovation administration\u201d. But photos of the meeting show a different story. Bezos looked grim, even frightened at times. This is hardly surprising. Trump waged a war of words with Bezos throughout the election, pledging to cause \u201cproblems\u201d for Amazon. He has also criticised Apple for its factories in China. The dynamics between Trump and tech \u2013 which will involve issues of trade, security and manufacturing \u2013 promises to be fascinating.",

If you trawl through newspapers and the internet looking for comments from the government about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-pay-tv\">proposed \u00a311.7bn deal</a>, you will not find much.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the junior culture minister, appeared in the Commons to answer an urgent question from Labour on the matter early last week, and that was it. \u201cAny transaction will be looked at on its merits, on a case-by-case basis,\u201d he said. How insightful.</p> <p>Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Greg Clark, the business secretary, have been silent on the matter. Karen Bradley, Hancock\u2019s boss and the culture, media and sport secretary, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/12/murdoch-sky-bid-culture-secretary-to-answer-urgent-question\">apparently unavailable to answer the urgent question in parliament.</a></p> <p>This all rather surprising when you consider that other investments in the UK from other overseas companies since the vote to leave the European Union have led to swift comments from the prime minister and chancellor praising their commitment to the country. The boss of Softbank, the Japanese company that bought technology group Arm for \u00a324bn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/18/philip-hammond-softbank-takeover-arm-holdings-overseas-investors\">even posed for photos with Hammond outside 11 Downing Street.</a></p> <p>Now, the government\u2019s silence on this issue may be because Sky shareholders have yet to vote on the proposal, or because it wants to leave the matter to Ofcom and other regulators. Hancock told MPs that the government must be \u201cscrupulously fair and impartial\u201d and that Bradley\u2019s role is \u201ca quasi-judicial one and it\u2019s important she acts independently and is not subject to improper influence\u201d.</p> <p>But that hasn\u2019t stopped the government before. Softbank\u2019s trip to Whitehall came on the day its bid was revealed, before the shareholder vote and before any regulator had cast an eye over the transaction.</p> <p>Instead, the government\u2019s silence looks like an attempt to distance itself from the Sky deal and depoliticise it. May has not even made a clear, public pledge to properly analyse the transaction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2016/sep/19/how-to-contact-the-guardian-securely\">How to contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In contrast, Gordon Brown, Vince Cable, Tom Watson and plenty of other politicians outside government have had lots to say about the proposal \u2013 mainly that May must ensure that Ofcom conducts a public-interest test on the deal, seriously consider whether the Murdochs are fit and proper people to control Sky and its news operations, or even simply block the proposal.</p> <p>The government\u2019s silence is further evidence that the deal could be railroaded through by 21st Century Fox and Sky before any opposition is allowed to build up a head of steam.</p> <p>Supporters of the takeover claim that much has changed since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\">Murdoch last tried to buy Sky in 2011</a>. His business has been split in two, with newspaper brands such as the <em>Sun</em> and the <em>Times</em> held within News Corp and the TV and film assets run through Fox. Also, Google and Facebook now dominate the digital advertising market, transforming the outlook for news and content providers.</p> <p>But both of these defences are easily dismantled. Firstly, splitting News Corp and Fox does not change the fact that one family could end up with extraordinary influence over British media. Take a look at the boards of News Corp and Fox \u2013 Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are the co-chairs of both, while James Murdoch is chief executive of Fox, on the board of News Corp, and chair of Sky.</p> <p>Secondly, recent changes in the media industry simply reinforce the importance of the established news providers emphasising their independence, credibility and quality. If the public question the veracity of what they read in newspapers or see on TV news, then it simply pushes more people to Facebook, Google and fake news.</p> <p>The government must not sleepwalk its way through this issue. The Fox-Sky deal must be rigorously tested, and the Murdochs should be called to appear in front of MPs to make guarantees about the future of the brands they could control.</p> <h2>A short-term boost for US<br></h2> <p>In the weeks since the US presidential election, financial markets have had a change of heart about Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>The knee-jerk reaction when the result came in was to assume the worst. Trump\u2019s programme was sketchy but seemed worrisome. He was threatening to get tough with China. He talked about protectionism. He had made minatory noises about the Federal Reserve. Put simply, Trump meant uncertainty, so markets sold off.</p> <p>This mood did not last long. Wall Street bulls quickly discovered a silver lining: Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes and increase spending on America\u2019s creaking infrastructure.</p> <p>Dealers in New York think looser fiscal policy means stronger US growth, which in turn will lead to higher profits for companies quoted on Wall Street. Hence the surge in the Dow towards the 20,000 mark.</p> <p>The upbeat mood was only briefly interrupted by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/us-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-second-time-since-2008\">Fed\u2019s interest-rate announcement last week</a>. Wall Street quickly shrugged off the quarter-point rise in borrowing costs and the indication that 2017 would see three further increases.</p> <p>There were two main reasons for this. First, recent form suggests the Fed might not go ahead with next year\u2019s monetary tightening. When it raised rates a year ago, it hinted at four increases in 2016. Only one was actually delivered: the one last week. Second, Wall Street thinks that even if the Fed does go ahead, the economic impact will be modest.</p> <p>In the short term, at least, both assumptions seem reasonable. The Fed is certainly not trigger-happy when it comes to rates and Trump\u2019s fiscal policy should guarantee growth next year. But investors need to be wary. Most of the fiscal boost is going to come through tax cuts, which will inject both demand and inflation into an economy already running up against capacity constraints. At some point in 2017 the Fed will adopt a more aggressive stance. Shares will suffer as the economy slows down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d083642685df7103f2d5c0ea78d5f6e155ec1e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d083642685df7103f2d5c0ea78d5f6e155ec1e4/0_204_3636_2182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon, during the meeting with Donald Trump last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon, during the meeting with Donald Trump last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tech v Trump? Could be interesting<br></h2> <p>Rarely can so much wealth and power have gathered around one table. In a meeting at Trump Tower last week the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/14/donald-trump-google-facebook-amazon-microsoft\">held talks with a group of technology bosses</a> that included Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google\u2019s owner Alphabet, and Elon Musk of Tesla.</p> <p>The executives left claiming it had gone well: Bezos even said he was \u201csuper-excited\u201d about the prospect of working with an \u201cinnovation administration\u201d. But photos of the meeting show a different story. Bezos looked grim, even frightened at times.</p> <p>This is hardly surprising. Trump waged a war of words with Bezos throughout the election, pledging to cause \u201cproblems\u201d for Amazon. He has also criticised Apple for its factories in China. The dynamics between Trump and tech \u2013 which will involve issues of trade, security and manufacturing \u2013 promises to be fascinating.</p>",
