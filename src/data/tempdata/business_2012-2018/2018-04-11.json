      "bodyText": "The IMF\u2019s latest world economic outlook report has found that the changing nature of work moving from blue collar to services need not increase inequality. But it also sounded a note of caution that without policies in place to encourage workforce participation, education and training as well as collective bargaining, inequality is likely to rise as the economy continues to change. Over the past 30 years the change in our labour market has been extraordinary. In 1987, men working in traditional \u201cindustry\u201d jobs such as mining, manufacture, construction, agriculture, transport and warehousing accounted for over a third of all employees. Now they account for just 24% and there are actually more men working in the \u201cservices\u201d sectors: Thirty years ago there were around 400,000 fewer women working in the services sector than there were men working in industry sectors. Now there are two million more women working in the services sectors compared with men in the traditional blue-collar industries: It is a change that has seen many men very much struggling to cope. Jennifer Rayner\u2019s recently published book, Blue Collar Frayed, looks at the situation of these men, noting that \u201cit is brutally clear that the days are gone when blokes with a little schooling but lots of practical smarts had plenty of options for good and secure work\u201d. The IMF\u2019s latest world economic outlook report has also noted these changes in the workforce across the major economies. The big changes in workforce participation over the past three decades really have been about women. Over that time the level of men aged 25 to 64 in work has barely changed. Yes fewer are working full-time now, but overall the same level of men working is the same. Whereas 30 years ago just half of women aged 25-64 were working, now over 71% do: The IMF has noted a similar occurrence across the advanced economies \u2013 little change, or at worst a slight decline, in the employment participation of men, but a big jump in that of women. The reasons are varied. It found that for youth and prime-age male workers, most of the decline is due to factors common across advanced economies. These common factors include technological progress or globalisation, structural changes in work, rising life expectancy and also the \u201ccommon scars from the global financial crisis\u201d. For women however, the big driver of increased workforce participation has been policies such as improved funding for childcare, parental leave and greater flexible working arrangements. These coupled with improved education have far outweighed the negative impacts of factors such as increased automation and outsourcing via trade: The importance of policies which encourage women entering the workforce and education is highlighted by comparing how poorly US women have fared compared with those in Europe and other advanced economies, where there has been a much higher rate of policy advancement on parental leave and childcare: It is a nice reminder of what happens when you leave things to the \u201cfree market\u201d \u2013 automation and technological changes ensured a fall in the level of women working. A similar situation occurred for male prime-aged workers. The US saw a much larger fall than other advanced economies due to a lack of education or policies designed to counter the impacts of automation and other factors: The IMF notes that the workers most at risk of unemployment are those in work \u201cvulnerable to automation\u201d. But they note that \u201cincreasing investment in education and training can not only make the workforce more resilient to changing labour needs, but also encourage labour force participation\u201d. It concludes that investing more in the education of the young is also critical to prepare them for the jobs of the future. This suggests some concern in Australia, given the fall in trades apprentices and traineeship numbers. While there has been a massive fall in the number of non-trade traineeships, mostly that is actually a good thing given the rorting that occurred after Rudd-Gillard government\u2019s changes to Vet Fee-Help funding that have now been stopped. But that does not excuse the fall in trades apprenticeships and traineeships. In 2012, 215,500 people were in a trades traineeship or apprenticeship; last year that number had fallen 22% to 168,000. In that context, Pauline Hanson\u2019s deal to get a pilot program of 1,000 apprenticeship placements in exchange for her voting for the government\u2019s company tax cut is, as I noted last month, pretty laughable: But the concern as well is that the shift from industry to services work will exacerbate inequality. Here the IMF is somewhat optimistic. It notes that the key driver behind greater pay inequality seems to be the \u201cdislocation of middle-skilled workers through technology and trade \u2013 and the resultant downward pressure on wages for medium- and low-skill jobs\u201d rather than a shift of people moving from industry to services work. It also found that countries with high levels of inequality within industry workers also had high levels of inequality within services sectors: As such it argues moves to improve inequality should not be about trying to prevent the growth of the services sector or trying to protect traditional blue-collar industries. Rather they argue government should focus on trying to \u201craise productivity across all sectors and make the gains from higher productivity more inclusive\u201d. To this end the report argues for \u201cexpanding access to training and education programs aligned with the needs of the evolving economy (including job-search assistance and training)\u201d and crucially the need for \u201csafety nets and redistribution policies targeted at displaced workers\u201d. But it also strikes a note of caution. While some problems may seem solvable through greater skills and education, it notes that \u201cdisplaced middle-skilled manufacturing workers may end up experiencing prolonged unemployment spells or dropping out of the labour force rather than taking low-wage jobs in services\u201d. And that would inevitably lead to an increase in inequality. It also notes that \u201cmanufacturing jobs tend to be characterised by formal employment arrangements with associated benefits for workers\u201d and also \u201ccollective bargaining via unions\u201d. A lack of these aspects within the services sectors will certainly cause inequality to rise \u2013 and as we have also seen, a slowing of wage growth for all workers.",

    "webTitle": "First UK strike action over restaurant tips looms at TGI Friday's", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "TGI Friday\u2019s is facing the first strike over tips in the UK in an escalation of a row between waiters and the restaurant chain. In February the casual dining chain, which has 83 outlets, proposed redistributing 40% of service charge payments paid on credit and debit cards to back-of-house employees, including kitchen staff, in lieu of a wage increase. Waiting staff are angry about the loss of card tips, which the Unite union claims they were not properly consulted about. Kitchen staff are said to be unhappy about swapping a rise in basic pay for a share of tips. Tips distributed via an automatic system called a tronc are excluded from national insurance, but that also affects the calculation of statutory payments such as redundancy, maternity pay and pensions. The company has denied that the decision to award kitchen staff a bigger share of tips was for tax reasons. Unite said it would ballot workers at two TGI Friday\u2019s restaurants about strike action over the new tips policy and allegations of unpaid trial shifts. Ballots will start in Covent Garden in central London and Milton Keynes next week, while there will be a protest outside the Covent Garden restaurant on Friday. \u201cOur members are bravely fighting back against a system that forces workers to live on low pay and without income security,\u201d said Unite regional officer Dave Turnbull. \u201cThey have decided to ballot for strike action in a wave of rolling strike ballots over the coming months because their employer has refused to address their concerns on tips and other issues.\u201d The potential strike action comes as the government faces renewed pressure to crack down on restaurants that ask waiters to hand over some, or all, of their tips. Some restaurateurs are using a variety of methods to withhold service charges paid on cards from staff as their profits are squeezed by a combination of the rise in the national minimum wage, increased competition and flagging consumer spending. Some are requiring waiters to pay a percentage of the sales they have generated to management, or persuading all staff to cut their wage rate to the legal minimum and make up the difference using tips. Such practices remain in place nearly two years after the completion of a government consultation on proposals to tackle unfair handling of tips after revelations in the Guardian and other papers. A number of prominent retail chains, including Pizza Express, changed their policies in the light of consumer pressure. Last year Harrods agreed to let staff keep 100% of the money raised from restaurant tips following a union-backed protest. But others, such as Caribbean restaurant group Turtle Bay and The Ivy Collection chain continue to take a cut of the service charge. Darren Jones, a Labour MP who recently highlighted the issue of tipping in parliament, said: \u201cThere is a theory that each time the government increases the living wage, businesses are trying to offset the cost by bringing in money from other sources such as tips.

      "bodyText": "The UK economy had a poor start to 2018. Manufacturing output was flat in January and fell slightly in February. Construction remains firmly in recession. Export volumes are rising but less quickly than imports. By the end of this month, the Office for National Statistics will publish its flash estimate of growth in the first quarter. Most City economists think it will be 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the final three months of 2017. At one of Britain\u2019s long-established thinktanks, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, they think it could be as low as 0.2%. There are reasons to think the position is not quite that gloomy. The unexpectedly cold weather, especially the snow at the end of February and the beginning of March, stopped work on building sites and prevented consumers from getting to the shops. On past form, there will be a bounceback in activity in the second quarter. The first quarter number may also be revised upwards. Even so, it is still obvious that the economy has lost momentum in recent months. Last year\u2019s story was of weaker but better-balanced growth, with consumer spending muted by industry doing well. This year\u2019s story, so far, has been weaker growth, pure and simple. There are reasons factory output has stalled. Sterling has been rising on the foreign exchanges as the markets have started to bet against a cliff-edge Brexit. That makes exports more expensive at a time when demand from the rest of Europe has faltered. After years of underinvestment, it is also the case that manufacturing has lacked the capacity to meet rising demand. The pound rose against the dollar after the news in anticipation of a quarter-point hike in borrowing costs from the Bank of England next month. This looks a bit curious. Threadneedle Street is clearly worried about wage inflation picking up, but in the past the Bank\u2019s response to such data would have been to cut borrowing costs, not raise them. Why the pay gap extends to pensions Three years have passed since new rules came into force allowing people over 55 to draw money out of their accumulated pension pots to live on when they stop working. The new arrangements are designed to provide more choice, but as new research from the financial firm Zurich UK has shown, they have also highlighted how the gender pay gap extends beyond retirement. Over the course of their working lives, women tend to earn less than men. Inevitably, therefore, they also tend to stick less into defined contribution pension schemes. That, in turn means, the average woman starting to draw down her pension has a pot of \u00a3132,000 compared with \u00a3212,000 for the average man. Assuming a 3% annual yield, that would provide a man with an annual income of \u00a36,360 according to Zurich\u2019s calculations, while a woman would get \u00a33,990. Clearly, women will have smaller pension pots than men until such time as they have equality in lifetime earnings. In the meantime, they would need to get a yield of 5% on their investments in order to achieve the same annual income as men. That\u2019s achievable, but only by taking more of a risk with the money carefully accumulated over the decades. Tesco bucks the trend The past year has been tough for the retail sector. A big structural shift \u2013 the relentless growth of online shopping \u2013 has coincided with a cyclical downturn caused by the impact of higher inflation on family budgets. Almost 6,000 shops across the UK closed last year \u2013 the biggest casualty list since the economy was clawing its way out of recession in 2010. All of which makes the performance of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer \u2013 Tesco \u2013 impressive. In the year to February, the company saw operating profits rise by 28% and gained market share in food despite the strong competition from Aldi and Lidl. The City liked what it saw in the Tesco numbers on Wednesday. For a start, Tesco seems to have recovered from the time three years ago when it announced a \u00a36.4bn loss \u2013 the biggest in British high-street history. Secondly, while it is still early days, investors think the takeover of the food wholesaler Booker will pay off. Finally, cost-cutting and greater efficiency meant profit margins rose to 3% in the second half of the year, making a 2019-20 target of 3.5%-4% look achievable, especially if, as looks likely, falling inflation and rising wages gradually boost consumer spending power.",

      "bodyText": "British Airways passengers will now have to pay to check luggage on some long-haul routes. A new \u201cbasic\u201d fare has been introduced for passengers who have only hand baggage, with tickets costing up to \u00a360 less than the standard return fare, the airline said. Basic fare tickets went on sale on Wednesday for flights from London to Austin, Boston, Delhi, Denver, Dubai, Hong Kong, Oakland, Philadelphia, Punta Cana and Singapore. The cheapest fare \u2013 to Dubai \u2013 will cost \u00a3143 each way. Passengers will still be served complimentary food and drink and be able to take two items of hand luggage on board. But checking a bag for people flying on basic fare tickets will cost from \u00a380 return, with seat selection starting at \u00a320 each way. BA already offers this type of basic fare on its short-haul flights. The airline said the move to offer a basic fare on long-haul routes was about being competitive with operators offering cheaper flights and was not about increasing the cost of a standard fare. \u201cWe know that when our customers travel with us, their needs vary from trip to trip. Some will be flying on business, some for leisure, some will be on short hops, others will be longer stays,\u201d said BA\u2019s chief commercial officer, Adam Daniel. \u201cWe need to ensure that the fares we provide reflect those differing needs so customers can select the best option for them on that occasion. \u201cSomeone travelling for a short meeting or leisure break, who isn\u2019t planning to check in a bag and is happy for us to allocate them a seat, will appreciate the option to secure a lower fare. They\u2019ll still receive our generous hand baggage allowance, a seat allocated to them in advance, complimentary food and drink, in-flight entertainment, blankets and headphones, all at no extra cost.\u201d The changes are part of a larger rollout by BA\u2019s parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), which will see American Airlines, Iberia and Finnair also introduce the basic fare. Last month Virgin Atlantic launched its first hand-baggage-only ticket in a major revamp of its economy service. It is offering cheaper fares on its routes that are similar to low-cost competitors, where passengers can take only cabin luggage and are not able to choose their seat in advance. In January the budget airline Ryanair changed its rules to restrict passengers to take only one small piece of hand luggage into the cabin \u2013 rather than the two items previously allowed \u2013 unless they paid for priority boarding \u2013 \u00a35 when first booked or \u00a36 later.",

It is offering cheaper fares on its routes that are similar to low-cost competitors, where passengers can take only cabin luggage and are not able to choose their seat in advance.</p> <p>In January the budget airline Ryanair changed its rules to restrict passengers to take only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/15/ryanair-5-pound-charge-wheelie-bag-in-overhead-locker\">one small piece of hand luggage into the cabin</a> \u2013 rather than the two items previously allowed \u2013 unless they paid for priority boarding \u2013 \u00a35 when first booked or \u00a36 later.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The large graphic accompanying your article (The cost of drugs, 9 April) has a major omission, one of the most important factors affecting medicine pricing and affordability. (There are others involving \u201cinternational reference pricing\u201d and \u201cparallel trade\u201d but that\u2019s a separate debate.) It charts the 13 years of rigorous clinical development required by regulators to ensure new drugs achieving regulatory approval are safe and effective. As the article states, all this R&amp;D costs an absolute fortune. The crucial missing piece is what happens next. Patent exclusivity is limited by regulations enabling other companies to make copies of the original licensed product (within a lot less than the 20 years referred to). Once these \u201cgeneric\u201d drugs are launched, the originators\u2019 revenues can quickly diminish to next to nothing, meaning that the companies investing in the R&amp;D have a relatively limited window to make their money. With such a relatively short duration to (more than) recoup the costs of investment, drug prices have to be higher than necessary. The issue is even more pronounced for medicines used to treat relatively rare conditions, where the cost per patient has to be necessarily high. If it wasn\u2019t then, simply, fewer new medicines would be made. I\u2019ve often advocated that if patent exclusivity was extended for two to three years, lower prices would be possible and in everyone\u2019s interest, except those generic companies who\u2019d have to wait a little longer before they could begin sales with their copies, but surely all the risk is being taken by and all the clinical unmet need is being satisfied by the originator. Giving them a few years longer to make sales (at a lower price) seems a sensible compromise, but under the complexity of international regulatory rules, changing such policy is extremely unlikely to happen. Adam Barak PPi Healthcare Consulting \u2022 I read your article with interest. The World Health Organization and more recently, as you note, the UN, have been clear on the urgent need to improve access to essential medicines globally. However, your article fails to mention innovative collaborative initiatives to increase supply of low-cost, quality-assured medicines in developing countries. One such mechanism is the Geneva-based Medicines Patent Pool (MPP). The MPP has been successful in brokering licences with major pharmaceutical companies to allow generic manufacture of new HIV, hepatitis C and tuberculosis treatments for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In HIV, for example, the MPP is now working with more than a dozen suppliers to produce UK-based ViiV Healthcare\u2019s dolutegravir. Affordable versions of this novel antiretroviral and new drug of choice in the United States could reach more than 100 developing countries over the coming years. And as international experts and scientists meet at the International Liver Congress this week in Paris, the MPP will have good news to share with the hepatitis C community. Its licensed antiviral, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s daclatasvir, paired with sofosbuvir, will soon reach many LMICs. As a result of generic competition, prices for hepatitis C drugs are dropping. Last October, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res announced it had secured a price of $120 for a three-month course of DAC/SOF, a dramatic cut from the original price point for the treatment in 2015. Marie-Paule Kieny Chair of the governance board, Medicines Patent Pool \u2022 Your article on the cost of drugs raised many important points, not least the sometime failure of Nice and drug manufacturers to reconcile value with profit. This seems particularly the case where the high cost of drug development is aligned with a relatively small and static client group. In such cases, surely a rich and mature society has a reasonable expectation of its government to set aside political and economic considerations in order to protect the interests of an acutely vulnerable minority. The current debate between NHS England, Nice and the manufacturer Vertex over the funding of Orkambi for sufferers of cystic fibrosis is a case in point. Is it not time for leaders and decision-makers to demonstrate their moral responsibility by acknowledging that one life is as valuable as another irrespective of the size of the client group to which it belongs?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House of Fraser will begin stocking \u201cpremium Chinese brands\u201d in its department stores as part of an effort by its parent company to burnish the image of goods made in China and support Beijing\u2019s trillion-dollar \u201cBelt and Road\u201d international trade plan. Sanpower, which bought House of Fraser in a \u00a3480m deal in 2014, said it hoped to harness the reputation built by the department store chain over 169 years to help persuade UK shoppers to buy luxury Chinese goods. The company did not name the brands destined for its 59-store network but said they would include everything from lingerie to electrical appliances. Sanpower\u2019s billionaire chair, Yuan Yafei, is expected to espouse the merits of the plan at a meeting in Shanghai on Thursday with the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who is hoping to bolster Sino-Scottish trade relations. The move comes as House of Fraser\u2019s financial health is under scrutiny after dismal Christmas sales and widespread malaise among UK high street retailers. \u201cThe traditional image associated with \u2018Made in China\u2019 is changing,\u201d said Simon Pickering, House of Fraser\u2019s UK director of global product sourcing. \u201cIncreasing numbers of high-quality Chinese products are becoming popular with British and European consumers. Once these products enter House of Fraser\u2019s sales channel, they will be able to access Europe and the greater global market, given quality and credit endorsement from House of Fraser.\u201d Sanpower said this would help support the one-party state\u2019s Belt and Road initiative, which aims to build a modern-day Silk Road of infrastructure bringing Chinese goods to the world through a vast web of trade partnerships. China\u2019s head of state, President Xi Jinping, recently pledged $126bn (\u00a389bn) to support the policy but has been forced to defend against suspicion about China\u2019s intentions. \u201cThe Belt and Road initiative is not a Chinese plot, as some people internationally have said,\u201d he told the state\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, this week. \u201cIt is neither the post-world war two Marshall plan, nor is it a Chinese conspiracy. If you had to [call it something], it\u2019s an \u2018overt plot\u2019.\u201d Sanpower bought House of Fraser in a deal worth \u00a3480m in 2013, but was recently rumoured to be seeking to sell its majority stake to the Chinese tourism group Wuji Wenhua amid concern about flagging sales. But sources close to the company have since insisted that Yuan is committed to long-term ownership of House of Fraser. At a meeting with the UK\u2019s international trade minister, Liam Fox, in Hong Kong this month, the Chinese entrepreneur said he planned to invest in House of Fraser. The Guardian revealed after the meeting that the Nanjing-based Sanpower was to inject \u00a315m into House of Fraser. A further \u00a315m investment has reportedly been agreed since then. Yuan is expected to make similar promises to those offered to Fox during Thursday\u2019s meeting in Shanghai, scheduled as part of Sturgeon\u2019s trade mission. Sturgeon\u2019s Glasgow Southside constituency is not far from the site of the drapers shop that opened in 1849 and eventually grew into the nationwide House of Fraser chain.",

A tweet from Donald Trump warning Russia to get ready for US missile strikes against its ally Syria sent the Russian rouble down 2.5% to its lowest level since November 2016. Surprise falls in UK manufacturing and construction output in February suggest the UK economy slowed in the first quarter of 2018. European stock markets are still trading lower. Wall Street has also opened lower.

The Russian rouble has fallen to its weakest level since November 2016, Turkey\u2019s lira hit another record low and emerging markets stocks slipped, after Donald Trump warned Russia in a tweet to \u201cget ready\u201d for US missile strikes against its ally Syria in response to Saturday\u2019s chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held town outside Damascus. In the US, consumer prices fell for the first time in 10 months in March due to weak gasoline prices, according to the Labor Department. The consumer price index slipped 0.1% last month, the first and biggest drop since May 2017. It comes after a 0.2% increase in February. However, the annual inflation rate rose to 2.4% from 2.2%, marking the fastest annual growth in a year. Here\u2019s some reaction to the news that online retailer Shop Direct will be closing three warehouses in Greater Manchester. Martin Lane, managing editor of money.co.uk, says: Another dark day for the retail industry with Shop Direct making nearly 2,000 members of staff redundant, proving even online retailers aren\u2019t immune to current economic pressures. The pattern of well loved stores filing for administration or cutting jobs over the last few weeks is terrible news for the UK\u2019s retail industry. The location of Shop Direct\u2019s warehouses appears to be the cause of these redundancies being made and with a new site not expected until 2021 there is little hope for staff to be transferred. It\u2019s undoubtedly distressing news for employees of Shop Direct and their families. Now is the time to check what redundancy rights you have and dig out any income or mortgage protection policies you hold. The website has a guide explaining redundancy rights. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has put out its monthly estimate of GDP growth. It reckons that growth slowed to 0.2% in the first quarter of this year, from 0.4% in the fourth quarter. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at NIESR, said The main reason for the weakness was severe weather in March which is likely to have disrupted activity in all major sectors of the economy. There is a small offset in industrial production growth which recovered in the first quarter after the previous quarter was affected by the Fortis oil pipeline shutdown. But he also warned that there could be larger than normal revisions to the data at a later stage, if previous severe weather episodes serve as a guide. Take for example the quarterly GDP growth for the final quarter of 2010 when the UK experienced a prolonged period of extreme cold weather. The economy was initially estimated to have shrunk by 0.5% but subsequent data revisions show that the economy expanded by 0.1% over this period. More bad news in the retail industry. The online retailer Shop Direct is to close three sites in Greater Manchester, leading to the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs, PA reports. The move is part of Shop Direct\u2019s plans to open a new warehouse in East Midlands Gateway, which will replace current centres in Shaw, Little Hulton and Raven. The firm said that the three sites have \u201climited accessibility, layout and loading restrictions\u201d, and no longer meet the group\u2019s \u201coperational ambitions\u201d. A total of 1,992 staff are to enter into redundancy consultation, with the number made up of 1,177 permanent Shop Direct jobs and 815 agency roles. The new site at East Midlands Gateway will be automated, with approximately 500 permanent roles created when operational in 2020. The number is expected to increase by an additional 200 to 300 agency colleagues during peak periods, Shop Direct said. \u201cFor Shop Direct to continue to meet customer demand, the business now needs a new, purpose-built and automated facility in a central, well-connected location, that can accommodate all one-man fulfilment and returns operations on one site, and that provides room for continued expansion,\u201d the company added. Returning to today\u2019s triple set of UK data - industrial production, trade and construction \u2013 the forecasting group EY Item Club has looked at the impact on GDP and interest rates. A largely disappointing set of news on the UK economy which fuels suspicion that GDP growth likely slowed to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter. While the weakened February data may surprise the Bank of England and provide some food for thought, the odds remain strongly in favour of the monetary policy committee pressing ahead with a 25 basis point interest rate hike to 0.75% at their May meeting. However, expectations of another hike in November may well be diluted. Investec economist George Brown is also predicting a slowdown to 0.3% GDP growth between January and March, from 0.4% in the final three months of last year. With the snowfall having spilled over into the first week of March, we could see another soft outturn cap off Q1. Overall, it seems likely that GDP growth will soften from the +0.4% (qoq) recorded in Q4, though the extent of this will largely hinge on how the dominant services sector has fared. Surveys suggest that the snow has weighed heavily on the sector, with the March services PMI falling to the lowest seen since immediately after the EU referendum in July 2016. Still, with snow affecting only a brief period of the quarter, we expect the impact to be relatively modest and have tentatively pencilled in a 0.1ppt slowing in growth to 0.3% for Q1. Here is our story The UK\u2019s sugar tax came into force on Friday, leaving a bitter taste for sugar companies and drinks manufacturers that now have to pay a levy on high-sugar drinks they sell. In another blow to sugar companies and farmers, sugar prices have fallen to 2 1/2 year lows, due to a glut of sugar on the market caused by high output from India and Thailand. India recently scrapped a 20% sugar export tax. The Indian Sugar Mills Association has revised its sugar output estimate for this season starting in October up to 29.5m tonnes. This still looks too low, as sugar output was 28.2m tonnes as of 31 March. World sugar prices have been falling for the last couple of years following a series of bumper crops. This has hit Germany\u2019s S\u00fcdzucker, Europe\u2019s biggest sugar producer, which issued a profit warning last week. FastFT quoted Michael McDougall at commodity brokers ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets: The market is finding it hard to get out from under the cloud of increased sugar production that is effectively the result of good weather and government policies. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said about the manufacturing and trade data: The modest stimulus to growth from sterling\u2019s 2016 depreciation has begun to fade, while the global trade upswing has lost some momentum too. Meanwhile Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, tweeted Returning to the trade data, while the goods trade deficit shrank in February, this reflected a drop in imports rather than an improvement in exports. And the deficit widened by \u00a3100m the three months to February. The ONS said movements in goods exports were largely offset by imports, therefore there was little change in the goods deficit with EU or non-EU countries, which widened by \u00a3200m and narrowed by \u00a3100m respectively in the three months to February 2018. The ONS head of national accounts Darren Morgan said: Manufacturing continued to grow in the three months to February but at the slowest rate seen since the summer, with increases in machinery, metal products and pharmaceuticals offset by falls in electrical appliances and oil refining. This drop in refining may have contributed to the fall in fuel exports and the large rise in fuel imports also seen in the three months to February. The trade deficit widened a little in the three months to February, with reduced imports of machinery offsetting the rise in fuel imports. Construction fell in the three months to February after an erratic couple of months, mainly due to a big decline in repair work. However, this was partially offset by growth in both infrastructure and housebuilding. The detail of the manufacturing data reveals that seven of 13 manufacturing sub-sectors declined in March, led by machinery and equipment, down 3.9%, the first fall since last June. Of the sub-sectors that upped their factory output in February, the weapons and ammunition industry stood out \u2013 output rose 28.6%, its strongest growth since August 2014. Pharmaceuticals were also up, by 3.3%. The ONS said there was some anecdotal evidence that heavy snow in late February hurt construction, although the impact was hard to quantify. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, was quick to respond to the data. Manufacturing\u2019s recent run of growth came to a halt in February though the picture across sectors was more varied, with some hefty output falls in some key sub-sectors. Whilst there doesn\u2019t appear to have been an appreciable impact on the sector\u2019s performance from the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 in February, weather-related events may yet have a bearing on the numbers in the coming month however. She added: Despite this, the data looks more like a temporary wobble than a turn for the worse. Whilst other indicators may have softened since the start of the year, on-going growth in the global economy should continue to spur growth across manufacturing in the coming quarters. Sterling slipped after the surprise falls in UK manufacturing and construction output in February. The figures will be scrutinised by the Bank of England, which has been widely expected to raise interest rates next month. Industrial production, which comprises manufacturing, energy and mining, rose 0.1% in February, a sharp slowdown from the 1.3% growth sen in January. The trade figures are better. Britain\u2019s goods trade deficit with the rest of the world shrank to \u00a310.2bn in February from \u00a312.2bn in January \u2013 the smallest shortfall since September, and better than the City had expected. The UK data are out. Manufacturing output fell unexpectedly in February, posting its first drop in almost a year, according to official figures. It fell 0.2% in February from the previous month and stagnated in January. The Office for National Statistics also reported another sharp drop in construction output of 1.6%, defying hopes of a small rebound after January\u2019s 3.1% slump. The figures suggest the UK economy may have slowed in the first quarter. Turning to oil, Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister said today that he was happy with the current state of the oil market. The oil cartel Opec, Russia and several other non-Opec countries began cutting supply in January 2017 in an effort to eliminate the global glut of crude that had built up in previous years. The pact has been extended until the end of this year. Speaking on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, a meeting of oil producers and consumers in New Delhi, Khalid al-Falih said: I think a lot of the glut has been cleared. Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister said the country \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest exporter of oil \u2013 would not let another supply glut develop, but also does not want oil prices to rise to \u201cunreasonable levels\u201d. Brent crude is trading at $70.82 a barrel, easing from the 2014 highs touched yesterday when escalating Middle East tensions were offset by increasing inventories and production in the US. Germany\u2019s VDMA engineering association has called on the West to lift some sanctions against Moscow. Its president, Carl Martin Welcker, has told Reuters that the association is hoping for a sustained recovery in demand from the Russian market. German engineering exports to Russia rose 22.5% to \u20ac5.3bn last year, but that was still far below a peak of almost \u20ac8bn peak in 2012. Welcker said: Russia has developed very positively over the past year, after all the disappointing years before. He urged the West to reconsider sanctions imposed on Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict. Economic sanctions have little political impact in this respect, we want them to be critically scrutinised. The things that work should be upheld and others should be loosened if possible. Russian stocks and the rouble have slumped since the US announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and officials on Friday. A report released this morning shows that Britain\u2019s high streets suffered more store closures in 2017 than in any year since 2010. Fashion retailers, shoe shops, travel agents and estate agents have been driven out by the rise of internet shopping. A net 1,700 chain shops closed their doors in 2017, according to analysis of the UK\u2019s top 500 towns compiled by the Local Data Company (LDC) for PricewaterhouseCoopers. An average of 11 stores a day opened, while 16 a day closed. The data does not include independent shops. Our retail correspondent Sarah Butler writes: Fashion and footwear stores were the hardest hit in 2017, according to LDC, as shoppers\u2019 freedom to spend on non-essentials was diminished by rising food price inflation, partly fuelled by the fall in the value of the pound after the vote for Brexit in 2016.

Other supermarkets Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrison\u2019s are also up. Asos shares have fallen as much as 7% despite strong results, after the company upped its investment plans. Shopping mall operator Hammerson shares rose 1% initially on news of its rejection of a revised proposal from Kl\u00e9pierre, but are now just 0.8% ahead. European stock markets have opened lower, as expected, with trade tensions simmering. FTSE 100 index in London down 0.27% at 7246.85 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.2% France\u2019s CAC down 0.1% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.17% at 23,133 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.2% Portugal\u2019s PSI down 0.2% Hammerson, which runs the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham and Brent Cross in London, said this morning that it has rejected a sweetened \u00a35bn bid from bigger French rival Kl\u00e9pierre. The French shopping mall operator offered to pay 635p a share in a mix of Kl\u00e9pierre shares and cash, up from its \u00a34.9bn proposal on 8 March (615p a share). The French firm is trying to thwart Hammerson\u2019s planned \u00a33.4bn tie-up with Intu that would create Britain\u2019s biggest property company worth \u00a321bn. Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s chairman, Jan-Marc Jestin, made the revised proposal in a meeting with Hammerson\u2019s chairman David Tyler on Monday evening. But Hammerson said it was only a marginal increase. Tyler said: The board has considered the revised proposal from Kl\u00e9pierre carefully. At 635p, it is only a 3% increase on the previous proposal and continues very significantly to undervalue the company.\u201d Britain\u2019s biggest retailer Tesco has reported a 28% rise in operating profits, beating City expectations. Profits were boosted by better than expected sales in the last three months of its financial year. Online fashion retailer Asos, which targets shoppers in their 20s, has also reported strong numbers. Sales were up 27% in the first half and it expects similar growth in the second half. Chief executive Nick Beighton said the firm would step up investment in distribution and logistics. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has issued a stark warning that the current system for world trade is \u201cin danger of being torn apart\u201d, with the potential to upset the present global economic upswing and make consumers poorer. She urged governments around the world to steer clear of protectionism or face negative consequences. Let us redouble our efforts to reduce trade barriers and resolve disagreements without using exceptional measures. You can read the full story here. Yesterday, stock markets in Europe and the US rallied after a speech by China\u2019s president Xi Jinping eased fears of a trade war between Beijing and the US. European stock markets are expected to open lower this morning, as concerns remain. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: For equity markets to regain a sense of equilibrium we need to start to see progress on the road away from a potential trade war, and currently there is no evidence of that whatsoever. The strange thing is that for all the warm words, and President Trump\u2019s positive response to them, is that what President Xi actually said wasn\u2019t much different to previous speeches he has made in the past, which means that eventually these words will need to be turned into actions. The easiest one to deliver is probably the reduction in tariffs on cars, but even that is likely to be difficult, particularly since further talks between the various parties aren\u2019t actually planned at the moment.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s high streets suffered 5,855 store closures in 2017, more than in any year since 2010, as fashion retailers, shoe shops, travel agents and estate agents have been driven out by the rise of internet shopping. A net 1,700 chain shops closed their doors in 2017, according to analysis of the UK\u2019s top 500 towns compiled by the Local Data Company (LDC) for PricewaterhouseCoopers. An average of 11 stores a day opened, while 16 a day closed. The data does not include independent shops. Fashion and footwear stores were the hardest hit in 2017, according to LDC, as shoppers\u2019 freedom to spend on non-essentials was diminished by rising food price inflation, partly fuelled by the fall in the value of the pound after the vote for Brexit in 2016. Overall spending on clothing and footwear has fallen by about 2% in the past two years, according to data from analysts at Kantar, with rapid growth in online spending mirrored by sliding sales in stores. However, there was a net rise in the number of beauty stores in 2017, while cafes, coffee shops, ice-cream parlours and bookstores also increased in number, according to the LDC data. The pace of closures increased substantially in the second half of last year, reflecting the switch to online shopping, combined with rising staff and business rates costs. Shoppers reined in spending, with consumer confidence reaching a four-year low in December. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: \u201c2017 was tough for the British retail industry, particularly the second half of the year. We saw volatility from month to month and across different sectors as wage growth failed to keep up with inflation, forcing many shoppers to think more carefully about their spending habits.\u201d The problems have continued into the first quarter of 2018, which PwC said was the toughest first quarter since the last recession in 2009-10. Big names including Toys R Us and Bargain Booze owner Conviviality have fallen into administration, while New Look is closing dozens of stores in a major restructure. Mothercare, Carpetright and Homebase are all considering closing dozens of stores. On Tuesday, lingerie brand Ultimo confirmed that it is to be wound up, blaming \u201cmore cautious consumer spending\u201d. Shoe chains Brantano and Jones Bootmaker called in administrators last year, resulting in the closure of about 170 stores in total, while discount fashion chain Store Twenty One went into liquidation, closing 125 outlets. Jaeger and Style Group, which includes Jacques Vert and Windsmoor, also closed some shops despite being rescued from administration. Some bigger chains including Clarks, Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams have closed a handful of stores as shoppers increasingly opt to browse and buy clothing via their smartphone or laptop. Glen Took, consumer insight director at Kantar, said clothing and footwear retailers\u2019 troubles reflected a change in culture towards enjoying experiences rather than buying products. \u201cPeople are trying to make the most of their time doing something with family or friends and then they go shopping on a Sunday evening on the internet. If you look at social media culture, if you are going to have an amazing time doing something you can put on Instagram, what is going to give? It could be you are going to wear the same shoes you wore last week.\u201d The Works discount bookshop chain drove the growth in bookstores, while WH Smith has been adding new specialist book sites as readers return to physical books while sales of ebooks have slowed. But the rise of online services spurred a dramatic drop in the number of banks, travel agents and estate agents on British high streets last year. Travel agency chains were hit by the highest number of net closures - 326 - while 201 banks, including more than 60 HSBC branches, shut their doors. With the ability to access goods and services quickly from home, families have less reason to hit the high street and are more likely to buy items only when they need them rather than picking up something on impulse or planning ahead. High street expert Mary Portas said the government could help by cutting business rates, but retailers needed to adapt or die. \u201cWe are going through a massive transition. Businesses that are going down are sometimes too big to be nimble and responsive and sometimes they are just mediocre and they haven\u2019t invested in what consumers want. It is about being innovative and creative.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK economic growth has fallen by half, forecasters say", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Economic growth in the UK is expected to have fallen by half in the opening months of the year, one of Britain\u2019s leading forecasting bodies has said, amid renewed concerns for the health of the economy. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said growth was set to fall to 0.2% in the first quarter of 2018 from 0.4% in the final three months of last year, when the economy enjoyed a mini-recovery despite an overall slowdown in 2017 triggered by the Brexit vote. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at the thinktank, said the main reason for the weakness was severe weather in March, dubbed the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d in the media, which was likely to have disrupted activity in all major sectors of the economy. The estimate, which comes ahead of official figures from the Office for National Statistics later this month, followed news that Britain\u2019s factories recorded a surprise fall in production in February, in the first drop in activity in the sector for almost a year. Confirming fears of a slowdown in the UK economy so far this year, figures from the ONS showed manufacturing output declined by 0.2% in February, falling well behind economists\u2019 expectations for growth of 0.2%. There was also a sharp drop in construction output, suggesting continued pain for the industry amid the fallout from the collapse of Carillion. Monthly output unexpectedly fell by 1.6% in February, as builders were hit by the snow at the end of the month. Factories producing machinery such as turbines, pumps, compressors and agricultural toolsrecorded the sharpest falls in February, the worst month for the manufacturing sector since March last year. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cManufacturing growth appears to have come off the boil.\u201d However, the ONS said there was no evidence that heavy snowfall in February had a negative impact on output, which will likely stoke fears for the health of Britain\u2019s factories \u2013 which have generally performed better than much of the economy in the last year. Overall industrial production, which includes mining, quarrying and energy, rose by 0.1% compared with the previous month. Energy supply provided the biggest contribution, rising by 3.7%, helped by the cold weather. The figures provide a snapshot of the economy just before there was further snowfall in early March, meaning there could be worse news to come from manufacturers. There had been signs of the weakness for the economy earlier this year from company surveys, which showed falling activity compared with the final months of 2017. However, there was better news for Britain\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 the difference between imports and exports \u2013 which shrank more than expected to \u00a310.2bn in February from \u00a312.2bn in January. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said there were still positive signs for the British manufacturing sector, with demand for goods helped by the strength of the world economy and a weak pound. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do well in terms of manufacturing output in conditions like that then we\u2019ve got problems,\u201d he said. NIESR said lacklustre initial readings for the economy can often be revised higher by the ONS, as officials continue to receive fresh data after they pronouncing their first assessment for growth.

Trinity Mirror shareholders voted in February to approve the deal to add the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday newspapers, as well as magazines including celebrity title OK!, to its national titles the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. The Competition and Markets Authority said on Wednesday that it was launching a phase one inquiry which will look at whether the deal will result in a \u201csubstantial lessening of competition\u201d in the national newspaper sales or advertising market. The CMA said it has until 7 June to decide whether to move to a fully fledged phase two competition investigation. The CMA has also referred the deal to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport to examine, saying it \u201cconsidered that the transaction may raise public interest considerations\u201d. Hancock will now weigh up whether the deal triggers media plurality concerns under the Enterprise Act 2002, which states that there is a need \u201cin relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in a particular area or locality of the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience\u201d. If he believes there may be concerns, he can ask Ofcom to look at whether the public will lose too much from a reduction in plurality with Trinity Mirror controlling so many national newspaper titles.

Trinity Mirror immediately announced the appointment of two of its own executives \u2013 Sunday Mirror and Sunday People editor Gary Jones, and Daily Mirror associate editor Jon Clark \u2013 as replacements. Fox has said he believes the deal will pass competition regulation muster, saying the combined circulation of Trinity Mirror\u2019s national titles would still be less than that of the Sun, and the titles would not control too much of the national newspaper ad market.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s painful run of record low wages growth may have finally troughed, according to the Reserve Bank governor, who says wages are expected to grow more quickly from this point. If so, it will be a welcome relief for households across the country, where staggeringly low wage increases of 2% and less in recent years have had a \u201csobering effect\u201d on household finances. The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, told a business gathering in Perth on Wednesday that economic conditions were improving in every region in Australia as the remnants of the destabilising wind-down in mining investment finally disappeared. He said the economy was likely to grow more strongly over the next two years than it did last year as non-mining investment increased, exports continued to grow, and more people found jobs, leading to a pick-up in wages growth and inflation. \u201cThe latest data suggest that the rate of wages has now troughed, with a pick-up evident in the most recent quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cA further lift is expected, but it is likely to be only gradual.\u201d The Turnbull government will welcome the expectation that Australia\u2019s run of record-low wages growth may be over, given this week\u2019s news that it has now trailed Labor for 30 consecutive Newspolls. Turnbull was at pains to remind voters this week of his government\u2019s employment track record, saying he has presided over 17 months of continuous jobs growth and a solid improvement in investment. \u201cRemember in 2016 I said \u2018jobs and growth\u2019? Well that\u2019s what we\u2019re delivering,\u201d he told 2GB radio on Monday. Lowe told the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday he did not see a \u201cstrong case\u201d for interest rates to rise in the short term. \u201cWhile some other central banks are raising their policy rates, we need to keep in mind that their economic circumstances are different and that they have had lower policy rates than us over the past decade, in some cases at zero or even below,\u201d he said. \u201cA continuation of the current stance of monetary policy in Australia will help our economy adjust and should see further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target.\u201d Australia\u2019s official cash rate remains at a record low 1.5%. The last time it was increased was more than seven years ago. Lowe cautioned there were some uncertainties with the economic outlook, mostly coming from the international arena. He said a \u201cserious escalation of trade tensions\u201d could threaten the global economy, and Australia had \u201ca lot riding on\u201d Chinese authorities successfully managing the buildup of risk in China\u2019s financial system. Domestically, he said the high level of household debt remained a \u201csource of vulnerability\u201d in Australia, although the risks in this area were no longer building. KPMG released its latest quarterly economic outlook this week, forecasting growth of 2.9% for this financial year, up from just 2% in 2016-17. A separate analysis by Deloitte Access Economics for the Minerals Council of Australia, released on Wednesday, found the mining sector had enjoyed its most profitable period in years, driven by stronger commodity prices and reversing the fall between 2012 and 2015. According to Deloitte\u2019s report, Australian mining companies paid $12.1bn tax in 2016-17, almost four times as much as the previous financial year and the highest since the mining investment boom in 2011-12.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is aiming to grab another \u00a32.5bn of sales in the UK as it teams up with wholesaler Booker to sell its products to independent corner shops, restaurants and cafes. The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket unveiled the plan as it announced a 28% rise in operating profits, bolstered by better than expected sales growth in the last three months of its financial year. The UK\u2019s biggest retailer said it made a pretax profit before exceptional items of \u00a31.64bn in the year to 24 February as total group sales rose 2.8% to \u00a357.5bn. Sales at established UK and Irish stores rose 2.4% in the final quarter, slightly ahead of the 2.2% expected by analysts. Dave Lewis, the chief executive, said: \u201cThis has been another year of strong progress, with the ninth consecutive quarter of growth. More people are choosing to shop at Tesco and our brand is stronger, as customers recognise improvements in both quality and value. \u201cWe have further improved profitability, with group operating margin reaching 3.0% in the second half. We are generating significant levels of cash and net debt is down by almost \u00a36bn over the last three years. All of this puts us firmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions.\u201d The update is the first since the completion of Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn takeover of the grocery wholesaler Booker last month. Booker\u2019s former chief executive Charles Wilson has taken over as head of Tesco\u2019s UK business. Lewis said the deal would bring about cost savings and a potential \u00a32.5bn in extra sales from joint projects. Tesco has already begun testing a mini version of Booker, badged Chef Central, at one of its supermarkets and is considering using its home delivery vans to serve Booker\u2019s clients, which include restaurants and independent convenience stores. Wilson said there were about 100 Tesco locations which could be suitable for Chef Central because Booker did not have a cash and carry nearby. Tesco is also rumoured to be planning to test a new discount chain or family wholesaler similar to Costco. Lewis declined to comment on those rumours. Tesco is also testing selling 30 Booker products, such as catering-size bags of rice, on the shelves supermarkets, while Booker is adapting 30 Tesco products, such as ready-made mash, for wholesale to its thousands of convenience store clients. The products will be made by Tesco suppliers but sold under different brand names. Despite rumours that Lewis might be tempted to leave Tesco and hand over the top job to Wilson, he indicated he planned to stay on. Lewis said he was \u201clooking forward to [Wilson] and I and the whole team working together over the coming years\u201d. Despite \u201cdifficult circumstances\u201d, which include a tough UK market and an inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office into accounting problems dating to 2014, before Lewis took charge, the Tesco boss said the company was \u201cslightly ahead of where we thought we might be at this stage\u201d. He said Tesco was still a work in progress. \u201cIt is definitely not job done \u2026 but we have to take comfort from what we have done,\u201d he said. According to the latest market share data from Kantar Worldpanel, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain held a 27.6% share of the market in the first 12 weeks of the year, unchanged from the same period in 2017. Lewis pointed to a \u201creally strong\u201d performance on food, which he said was the engine of growth. He said Tesco had gained market share on food in the UK over the past year as food sales had risen by nearly 3% in value, although the volumes rose just 0.7%. He said there was growth across the business with sales at Tesco\u2019s largest stores, which had been hardest hit by changing shopping habits, up 2.3% in the final quarter. Online grocery sales rose 5% but non-food sank 11.3% online and 0.4% in established stores.. The step up in performance came despite a softening in food inflation from about 3% to 2.4%. Lewis said food inflation had dropped to just 0.8% in the last month. The strong performance in the UK was offset by difficulties in Asia where underlying sales slid 14% in the fourth quarter \u2013 a deterioration from the 9.6% seen in the previous three months. Lewis said the fall was partly linked to a change in strategy away from unprofitable bulk sales and discount coupons.",

      "bodyText": "UK music company revenues last year grew at the fastest rate since the height of Britpop in the mid-1990s, as the growing popularity of services such as Spotify resulted in income from streaming overtaking CD sales for the first time. UK record labels enjoyed a 10.6% surge in earnings in 2017 to \u00a3839m, thanks to the digital popularity of a new generation of artists including Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith, Dua Lipa and Stormzy. It was the fastest growth since 1995, when Oasis, Blur and Pulp created a high-street CD sales frenzy. Music companies enjoyed a 45% year-on-year increase in subscription streaming revenue \u2013 from \u00a3239m in 2016 to \u00a3347m \u2013 as an industry hammered for a decade by illegal piracy now enjoys the success of music lovers turning to legitimate services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. Royalty income from the sale of CDs, which have been in decline since the onset of the digital music era almost two decades ago, edged up 0.7% on the previous year to \u00a3246.9m in 2017. Record labels may be enjoying the fruits of new-found digital growth, but they say that not all tech companies are treating the industry fairly. The report from music industry body, BPI, shows that labels and their artists earn more than double the royalties from vinyl record sales than they did from payments from the viewing of music videos on Google-owned YouTube last year. UK vinyl sales grew for the 10th consecutive year to a 26-year high of 4.1m units, driven by albums from Liam Gallagher, Fleetwood Mac and the Guardians of the Galaxy film soundtracks, generating \u00a355m in royalties. By contrast, music video streaming, dominated by YouTube, which made ad revenue from more than 25bn UK music video streams last year, funnelled just \u00a327m to the industry. This was a small increase on the \u00a323.3m paid out in 2016. By comparison, revenues from LP sales rose a healthy 23.6% year on year, from \u00a344.6m to \u00a355m. Last year, a leaked memo from Steve Cooper, the chief executive of Warner Music, said its new deal with YouTube was so one-sided that it couldn\u2019t be called a \u201cfree market, willing buyer, willing seller\u201d negotiation. \u201cGovernment action is is needed to remedy the continuing \u2018value gap\u2019 so that all digital platforms pay fairly for their use of music,\u201d said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the Brit Awards. The BPI said the total \u00a3839m the labels made from streaming, downloads, physical sales and licensing for use in films, TV and computer games was the highest amount since 2010. However, it is still nearly one-third lower than the UK music industry\u2019s peak year of 2001, when income topped \u00a31.2bn. Taylor said there were no signs of growth slowing down, with innovations such as Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speakers, which are promoting the playing of music around the home, and the launch of a premium music service from YouTube set to fuel further growth. \u201cThe changes labels have made to their business models and their investment in new talent have borne fruit,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe are likely to see a continuing rise in 2018, with increasing awareness about consumers about the benefits of music streaming, and new developments that are likely to encourage the uptake of more subscriptions.\u201d",

However, it is still nearly one-third lower than the UK music industry\u2019s peak year of 2001, when income topped \u00a31.2bn.</p> <p>Taylor said there were no signs of growth slowing down, with innovations such as Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speakers, which are promoting the playing of music around the home, and the launch of a premium music service from YouTube set to fuel further growth.</p> <p>\u201cThe changes labels have made to their business models and their investment in new talent have borne fruit,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe are likely to see a continuing rise in 2018, with increasing awareness about consumers about the benefits of music streaming, and new developments that are likely to encourage the uptake of more subscriptions.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Princess Yachts has reported record annual revenue for 2017, bolstered by the booming global economy and foreign buyers attracted by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote. The Devon-based company expects 2018 to be even better after taking on 500 workers at its Plymouth shipyard to meet \u201cexploding demand\u201d from global customers who pay up to \u00a318m for a luxury boat. Revenue for the year to the end of December jumped 27% to a record \u00a3274.4m as orders streamed in from the US, Asia and Europe as well as the UK. As a result, Princess swung to an operating profit before exceptional costs of \u00a37.9m from a loss of \u00a37m the year before. The company\u2019s order book stands at \u00a3750m and its workforce has jumped to 2,700 from about 2,200 at the start of 2017. Princess delivered 230 boats in 2017 but it has been selling them at a rate of about 300 a year. Antony Sheriff, its executive chairman, said business was booming because its wealthy customers felt more confident about spending their money amid strong global growth. Princess was capitalising on this demand with new models, better technology and improved customer care, he added. \u201cThe macroeconomic situation, other than recent rumblings of trade wars, is one where the market continues to grow and people are feeling very optimistic,\u201d Sheriff said. \u201cWe are going to increase production by about 25% and we have hired 500 new people to meet exploding demand.\u201d He said the pound\u2019s fall since the 2016 Brexit vote had made his firm\u2019s boats more attractive for international buyers. The Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts have also brought the US market back to life, Sheriff added. \u201cIf someone is paid $1m a year and instead of being taxed $400,000 they are taxed $300,000 they know they are going to make more money and, if they already have the inclination, they will go out and buy a boat.\u201d Princess\u2019s range starts at \u00a3300,000 for the V40, a 13m motor yacht with two double cabins. Its most expensive model is the 40m, three-deck 40M, which costs \u00a315m, or \u00a318m including VAT if bought in the UK. Princess delivered one 40M last year and sold two more. Sheriff declined to give examples of his customers, describing them only as \u201crich people\u201d. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to have customers who like to show off their boats moored in marinas with flashing lights.\u201d Orders are strong in Europe, Hong Kong, the Middle East and South East Asia, with interest picking up in mainland China, he added. Despite Britain slipping down the global growth rankings, UK orders are steady but Russia and Ukraine have less demand. Princess\u2019s growing order book highlights the growing disparity between the rich and the global poor. Sheriff said more people were becoming wealthy, adding: \u201cOnce you\u2019re in that category you can afford to buy a yacht\u201d.\u201d With US sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs and heightened concern about the UK\u2019s role in absorbing Russian wealth, Sheriff said: \u201cWe do know-your-customer very carefully on all our customers to make sure we stay within the realms of the law.\u201d",
