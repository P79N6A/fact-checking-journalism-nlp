      "bodyText": "When Mark Carney put a rocket under the FTSE 100 on Thursday with his pronouncement that interest rates were likely to be cut to tackle the economic fallout from Brexit, there was one sector of the stock market that remained in the doldrums. While the governor of the Bank of England was making life a misery for savers \u2013 who have already tolerated record-low returns for the near-eight years since the banking crisis \u2013 he was also sending a miserable message to the banks. The headline \u201clower for longer = bad\u201d in a research note published by analysts at Deutsche Bank last week sums it up. Low interest rates makes it harder for banks to make a profit on the difference between the rates that are paid on savings and the rates that can be charged on loans. On top of that, a slowdown in the UK economy is being predicted \u2013 Goldman Sachs cut its forecasts for growth to 0.2% last week. There are also expectations that the housing market will slow and unemployment will rise, pushing up bad debts \u2013 all of which makes for an uncomfortable environment for high-street banks. The risk is that strategies drawn up by bank bosses \u2013 already trying to adapt to the digital era \u2013 will have to be torn up, with more job cuts and branch closures as a new wave of cost-cutting measures bite hard. Dividends to shareholders are being described as \u201ctoast\u201d. Last week\u2019s share prices illustrate this: while the FTSE 100 index is up since the referendum, Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s shares are down 32% while rival bailed-out bank Lloyds is off 25%, as is Barclays. The so-called challenger banks aiming to take on the established players on the high street have also had a torrid time \u2013 Virgin Money, for instance, is down 30%. Global banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered have fared better; HSBC is up since the historic vote. Philippe Bodereau of the bond investor Pimco believes the falls are justified. \u201cLower interest rates, slower loan growth and rising credit losses all feed into lower forecasts further earnings,\u201d he says. Even before Carney warned about interest rates, analysts at Bernstein had declared that Barclays and RBS were \u201calmost uninvestable\u201d. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s has warned 12 UK banks and financial institutions could face a credit downgrade. Crucially, unlike eight years ago, no one appears fearful for their very survival. Jes Staley, seven months into his new job as chief executive of Barclays, told Bloomberg share prices were crumbling because of concerns about profits. \u201cWe got no sense of concern about our capital nor liquidity, and properly so, but there is a concern about our earnings,\u201d Staley said. He was adamant that Barclays should not change his strategy of focusing on being a transatlantic business with an investment banking arm. The Brexit shock is hitting the banking sector while it is already in the midst of a reorganisation \u2013 prompted by the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 to meet a 2019 deadline to \u201cringfence\u201d retail banking businesses from investment banking operations. Barclays is among those in the throes of this task. It is also hitting before George Osborne has managed to sell off the taxpayer\u2019s remaining 9% stake in Lloyds and 73% stake in RBS. At Lloyds, whose focus is entirely on the UK, at least 45,000 jobs have gone since the financial crisis, and more pain could yet be felt. \u201cWe expect the bank to cut costs aggressively; on top of the current cost plans, we expect a leg-up in cost reductions around the commercial banking operations,\u201d said analysts at Bernstein. As far as RBS is concerned, the experts believe Brexit pushes any chance of it paying its first dividends since 2008 even further into the distance. Analysts at Deutsche suspect this could become a problem for all the banks. \u201cWe think management teams will have limited incentive to deliver significantly higher dividends while the Bank of England is likely to be cutting growth forecasts and/or interest rates. It is also unclear at this stage if the regulator will be willing to sign off large dividend payouts/buybacks, given the environment,\u201d the Deutsche analysts said. The Bank of England\u2019s view will become clearer on Tuesday when it publishes its half-yearly assessment of risks to the financial system. Carney has already said banks are holding more capital and more liquid assets than before the crisis. He has also acknowledged that low interest rates cut profits so much that it could reduce banks\u2019 willingness to lend. However, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money, put a more positive gloss on low interest rates, telling the BBC\u2019s Today programme last week that they should stimulate the economy, which would help the banking sector.",

      "bodyText": "Red and blue banners decked out the cinema in Beijing\u2019s Sanlitun district as eager World of Warcraft video game disciples bustled inside for the film premiere. It was after midnight on 8 June and fans of the blockbuster game had queued for ages to see the big-screen version. But the late hour did nothing to dampen the carnival atmosphere: fans had come armed with game props, and were in costume, or at least wearing T-shirts with official logos. Cinemas across China were decked in the colours of the hit video game\u2019s opposing camps \u2013 the blue Alliance flag and the red Horde banner. Seats were also split between red and blue. He Shuai, a 27-year-old World of Warcraft devotee, told newspaper Shanghai Daily: \u201cIt was like a festival.\u201d By the end of its first week, the popularity and huge commercial success of the film was threatening to turn China\u2019s relationship with Hollywood on its head. The $160m film Warcraft was a critical and financial flop in the US, making just $24.4m in its opening weekend. The story in China was completely different: the film racked up a whopping $156m in its first five days \u2013 more than Star Wars: The Force Awakens did in its entire theatrical run ($124m). The success of Warcraft the film was partly down to the huge and fanatical following the gaming franchise has in China, where about half of its 5 million players live. China\u2019s influence on Hollywood has been growing for some time, but many in Tinseltown believe the industry has reached a watershed moment. They predict that US studios may soon start making films just for a Chinese audience. Dalian Wanda \u2013 the Chinese conglomerate that owns Atletico Madrid football club, AMC Entertainment (the second-largest cinema chain in the US), as well as Wanda Cinema Line, the biggest chain in China \u2013 snapped up US film studio Legendary Entertainment for $3.5bn at the beginning of the year. Wanda is controlled by China\u2019s richest man, Wang Jianlin, who has an estimated fortune of $27bn. It is the first Chinese group to own a major Hollywood studio. \u201cWanda Cinema already has made tremendous development in China, but it isn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Wang. \u201cMovies are global, and our company certainly wants to add its voice to the world film market.\u201d Legendary has produced several big-budget blockbusters, including the Dark Knight trilogy, Jurassic World and the Hangover franchise. Crucially, it was also behind Warcraft. The marriage of Legendary\u2019s film-making experience with Wanda\u2019s giant network of cinemas brings the prospect of Hollywood blockbusters being made specifically for China a lot nearer. Jeff Bock, of research firm Exhibitor Relations, summed up the thoughts of many pundits: \u201cWarcraft is a juggernaut in China, but was a non-event in North America. What if they didn\u2019t even attempt a domestic [US] release with the sequel?\u201d The power of the Chinese market to make or break a film is now so great that Hollywood has already started to tailor its films to that audience. Superhero film Dr Strange, out later this year, had to change a key character from Tibetan to European in order to avoid causing offence. In 2013, Iron Man 3, the story of what was once a Chinese-born villain was also altered; and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson has just signed to star in Skyscraper, a version of Die Hard set in China. The message for Hollywood\u2019s money men is clear \u2013 if you play nicely, you will be handed the keys to a market of 1.4 billion potential cinemagoers, who are forecast to spend $15bn by 2020. Such huge potential rewards have attracted investors like A-listers to a red carpet. After the Wanda deal, Tang Media Partners, created by businessman Donald Tang and backed by Chinese internet firm Tencent, bought IM Global, a Hollywood film financier and sales agency. The deal also involved China Media Capital (CMC), owned by media mogul Li Ruigang, and film production company Huayi Brothers. CMC\u2019s Li has also done deals with Warner Bros, and state-controlled operator Hunan TV &amp; Broadcast has invested in Lionsgate, the studio behind The Hunger Games and TV smash Mad Men. Tang believes that rising demand for Chinese-themed content will result in two of the six major US studios being Chinese-owned within 10 years. Investors from the People\u2019s Republic have stepped up moves to cash in on the increased spending power of a burgeoning middle class, whose per capita income has risen 20-fold in a generation. Evidence from box office receipts suggests the appetite for cinema has defied the slowing economy, and some see the Chinese movie market as having significant growth potential. At present, the Chinese market is worth almost $8bn, and growing. It is set to overtake the US next year as the world\u2019s biggest box office, according to the Hollywood Reporter. That may not seem too surprising for a large country with increasing levels of wealth. But it has achieved this at a time when China\u2019s State Administration of Press, Publication, Film and Television allows only 34 foreign-made films to open in the country each year. This strict quota, along with the threat of censorship, means that not all American blockbusters are given a crack at this giant market \u2013 and it also means that studios have to choose which films they want to place there. Under Wanda\u2019s ownership, Legendary should have a better chance of its films being screened in China \u2013 not least because it owns Wanda Cinema Line. Owning both a production studio and cinema chain is a vertical business model that was outlawed in the US on competition grounds in a landmark 1948 case against Paramount Pictures \u2013 which led to the demise of the classic Hollywood studio system. But this integrated content and distribution model was a boon for Warcraft. The film appearing on 67% of China\u2019s 39,000 cinema screens, with screenings scheduled through the night to satisfy demand. Zeng Maojun, president of Wanda Cinema Line, says China is adding 15 screens a day and reckons the number in the country could double to as many as 80,000. With booming box office receipts and increased control of both the production and the distribution of Hollywood films, it is difficult to see how anything can halt the momentum of China\u2019s movie juggernaut. Jackie Chan, the high-kicking martial arts film star, summed up the shift at last month\u2019s Shanghai film festival. \u201cWarcraft made 600m yuan (\u00a364m) in two days,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has scared the Americans. If we can make a film that earns 10bn yuan (\u00a31bn), then people from all over the world who want to study film will learn Chinese, instead of us having to learn English.\u201d TOP 10 IN CHINA Yuan, billions THE MERMAID 3.391 MONSTER HUNT 2.439 FURIOUS 7 2.426 TRANSFORMERS 4 1.977 MOJIN: THE LOST LEGEND 1.682 LOST IN HONG KONG 1.613 ZOOTOPIA 1.530 AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON 1.464 WARCRAFT 1.463 GOODBYE MR LOSER 1.441 Source: China Boxoffice",

But it has achieved this at a time when China\u2019s State Administration of Press, Publication, Film and Television allows only 34 foreign-made films to open in the country each year.</p> <p>This strict quota, along with the threat of censorship, means that not all American blockbusters are given a crack at this giant market \u2013 and it also means that studios have to choose which films they want to place there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"420dcb2d245a78bda94794371ff69b448532a5f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/420dcb2d245a78bda94794371ff69b448532a5f4/0_68_1932_1159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cinema audience in Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei Province\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cinema audience in Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei Province.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under Wanda\u2019s ownership, Legendary should have a better chance of its films being screened in China \u2013 not least because it owns Wanda Cinema Line. Owning both a production studio and cinema chain is a vertical business model that was outlawed in the US on competition grounds in a landmark 1948 case against Paramount Pictures \u2013 which led to the demise of the classic Hollywood studio system.</p> <p>But this integrated content and distribution model was a boon for <em>Warcraft</em>.

      "bodyText": "The US real estate market could get a boost in the coming months, some analysts are predicting, thanks to the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. The news could add further fire to the already overheated property markets in some of the US\u2019s biggest cities. Uncertainty about UK\u2019s future and its economy could put real estate market on pause, especially in London, and sending international investors in search of another safe-haven property market. Most experts agree the US is likely to see increased demand. The Brexit fallout could especially affect areas and industries that depend on the UK\u2019s immigrant population. Analysts already have started to speculate that firms in the financial and tech sector are most likely to leave the UK if Article 50 \u2013 the grounds for the UK\u2019s EU divorce \u2013 is activated. BlackRock\u2019s real estate analysts have calculated that UK commercial property values could drop by as much as 10% over the next year thanks to declines in London. Mike Prew, an analyst with Jefferies LLC, estimated that international business could move as many as 100,000 jobs out of the UK and that London office rents could fall 18% within two years of Article 50 being activated. \u201cHouse prices over the medium-term could easily drop by a fifth or more from those peaks as confidence weakens, the economy slows and lenders and investors become more cautious,\u201d said Michael Ball, professor of Urban and Property Economics at Henley Business School in UK. According to him, the prospects for private rented sectors are poor, especially outside London, where immigrants have been an important source of demand. Lower interest rates are the \u201conly great thing\u201d about Brexit, according to Leonard Steinberg, broker and a president of Compass, a US residential real estate brokerage firm. On Thursday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney suggested that the bank might cut interest rates in the coming months to cushion the blow to the economy caused by the Brexit vote. \u201cI have never seen a really bad real estate market in a low interest rate environment. With low interest rates, you have very solid tool to insulate the real estate market, but real estate purchases for individuals are very, very much driven by job security,\u201d said Steinberg, pointing out that there are many moving parts. \u201cFor instance, what if Brexit leads to job losses and people have a fear of job loss even if they do not lose their jobs. You are not going to want to enter into a mortgage commitment today if you might lose your job. I think that\u2019s concern that every seller and buyer will have in the UK.\u201d Those looking to invest in real estate will be closely monitoring how the pound is doing, according to Louis Archambault, a real estate lawyer and expert and partner at Arnstein &amp; Lehr LLP. \u201cIf the dollar becomes stronger than the pound, it changes the dynamic of what\u2019s attractive. It\u2019s then not only cheaper to travel to Europe, it would then be cheaper to buy property in Europe as well,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf you have the ability to have strong currency exchange, then property that might be otherwise out of reach suddenly might become a possibility.\u201d And while a weak pound might draw in investment from some foreign nationals looking to buy cheap or affordable property in London, uncertainty about the UK economy as a whole might send them elsewhere, including the United States. \u201cOne thing that Europe has shown is that it doesn\u2019t move quickly when it comes to politics so if you were sitting on a pound over the dollar, this is a good time to move that money to the United States,\u201d advised Archambault, who is based in Miami. He does not foresee the pound going up over the next few years. \u201cThe US is one of the more stable markets right now in the world. I would be looking very seriously to converting that money and investing it in United States.\u201d Steinberg agreed that the uncertainty in the UK could benefit the real estate in the US. \u201cDollars have to flow somewhere. All currencies have to flow somewhere to be invested \u2013 why not in the safest economy and environment and that could be the United States?\u201d he said, adding that big cities have been doing especially well. However, the US is dealing with some uncertainty of its own. \u201cIf you have a Hillary Clinton elected, you have a pretty good idea of what you are going to get. If you get a Donald Trump elected, I don\u2019t think you have a clear picture of exactly what you are going to get,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cMarkets \u2013 and economists and business people \u2013 like stability and knowing what they are dealing with. Unknown is always something that scares markets.\u201d",
