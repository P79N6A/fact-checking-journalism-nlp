      "bodyText": "One of the world's wealthiest men was dealt a blow by one of the world's poorest countries on Wednesday when an investigation by the government of Guinea concluded that a company run by billionaire Beny Steinmetz should be stripped of lucrative mining concessions because it had obtained them through corruption. The decision is a turning point in the two-year battle between Steinmetz and the first-ever democratically-elected government of the impoverished west African country of Guinea for control of the world's riches untapped iron ore deposits. Steinmetz had acquired the rights to a giant deposit beneath the Simandou mountains in a deal that was widely regarded as remarkable, even within the buccaneering world of African mining: his company BSG Resources (BSGR) said it had won two mining concessions as a result of a $165m (\u00a398.5m) investment in the exploration of the area. It then sold 51% of its prize to the Brazilian mining giant Vale for $2.5bn. However, a government committee in the Guinean capital of Conakry now says it possesses what it describes as \"precise and coherent evidence\" that BSGR used intermediaries to pay bribes to Mamadie Tour\u00e9, the wife of Lansana Cont\u00e9, the dictatorial ruler of the country until his death in 2008. She claims to have received a series of payments totalling over $3m from BSGR representatives starting in 2006, and to have signed a contract for a further $5m in 2010. \"Such corrupt practices nullify the mining titles and the mining convention,\" the committee said in its 33-page report. Much of the evidence was gathered in the US by the FBI during an inquiry into the activities of Frederic Cilins, an associate of Steinmetz, and handed over to the government of Guinea. Cilins is said to have offered further bribes to Tour\u00e9, totalling $150,000, to persuade her to destroy documents that allegedly detail the corrupt payments said to have secured the mining concessions. He was arrested in Florida after the FBI recorded a series of meetings with Tour\u00e9, and faces four years in prison after pleading guilty last month to obstructing a criminal investigation. The US investigation into alleged breaches of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is continuing. The committee in Conakry published some of the evidence gathered by the FBI, including transcripts of conversations recorded covertly when Cilins and Tour\u00e9 met at Jacksonville airport in Florida on several occasions last year.

Vale has already paid over $500m to BSGR and invested further sums in the venture. The company said it had entered into the joint venture on the basis of its understanding that the concessions had been \"obtained \u2026 lawfully and without any improper promises or payments\". Vale is understood to now be planning legal action against BSGR. Guinea possesses abundant reserves of diamonds, bauxite, gold and uranium, as well as iron ore. Despite this, it is one of the world's most impoverished countries, and much of its population live without clean water, electricity or education. Responsibility for this state of affairs has been attributed to Cont\u00e9 and the small number of relatives and other associates who surrounded him during the years of his rule. One Human Rights Watch report described this group as being to blame for the \"criminalisation of the state\". In 2010, however, following the election of Alpha Cond\u00e9 as president, the government began to re-examine past mining contracts, including the deeply-controversial BSGR iron ore deal. Steinmetz, 58, is an Israeli citizen and is said to be that country's richest businessmen, with an estimated wealth of around $6.7bn. He controls BSGR through family trusts. The company is registered in Guernsey and has offices in London and Geneva. His business is also under investigation by Swiss authorities. Last year, following a request by the government of Guinea, Swiss police raided the Geneva offices of a company that provides management services for BSGR, and searched a private plane used by the tycoon. Steinmetz's spokesman said BSGR denied any wrongdoing and would disprove the allegations. \"The Guinean government is relying on fabricated claims, compromised witnesses and illegitimate processes,\" he said. He also alleged that the concessions had been acquired lawfully and were being taken away in order to reward the government's political allies, a claim that the government of Guinea denies. In the past, Steinmetz has claimed that the allegations against him are rooted in envy at his success. He is widely expected to attempt to recover the rights to the Simandou deposit by bringing proceedings in an international court of arbitration. There was no immediate comment from his spokesman about the transcript of the FBI recording in which Cilins claimed that Steinmetz had authorised the payment of bribes. Beny Steinmetz: losing his sparkle? According to the official website of Beny Steinmetz, the Israeli diamond, finance and property tycoon, the expression \"the sky's the limit\" could never be applied to his business ambitions. \"To him,\" the website says, \"the sky is only the beginning.\" Given the nature of his ambition, it is perhaps not surprising that when he decided to branch out into African iron ore mining, he struck not just a deal, but the deal \u2013 \"the jackpot\" in the words of one industry observer. The deal in which Steinmetz acquired an iron ore concession in Guinea, west Africa, that was worth at least $5bn, through an investment of $165m, is coming back to haunt him. One corruption probe in Guinea has resulted in him being stripped of the iron ore concession, while a second, conducted by the FBI, is grinding on in the US. Steinmetz was born in April 1956 in Netanya, Israel, the fourth child of Rubin Steinmetz, who had established a successful family diamond trading business. After completing his military service, he left for Belgium at the age of 21 to work for a leading diamond dealer. Later he joined forces with his brother, Daniel, to create Steinmetz Diamonds Group and subsequently the Beny Steinmetz Group. Today, estimates of his wealth vary from $4bn to $6.7bn. Steinmetz holds a French passport along with his Israeli citizenship and described himself as an \"international Israeli\". He divides his time between Israel, Geneva and the south of France. He and his wife Agnes met as teenagers and have four children. Ian Cobain",

      "bodyText": "Computing multinational Hewlett-Packard (HP) is to pay US regulators $108m to settle a corruption scandal involving employees at subsidiaries in three countries, who were charged with bribing government officials to win and retain lucrative public contracts. The case piles further pressure on the HP boss, Meg Whitman, who is already managing the fallout from her company's disastrous acquisition of the British software group Autonomy, while losing ground commercially to Samsung, Apple and Chinese rival Lenovo. Corruption was unearthed in relation to contracts worth $40m to install IT equipment at the national police headquarters in Poland, \u20ac35m of work for government prosecutors in Russia, and a deal to supply Mexico's state-owned petroleum company. The investigation has involved regulators in Poland and Germany, the US Department of Justice (DoJ), its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the FBI. A parallel criminal case has now been announced by the DoJ. In Poland, prosecutors on Wednesday charged a former HP executive, named in accordance with local law only as Tomasz Z, with handing over cash, computers and audio and video equipment worth more than $600,000 to the head of IT at the country's police headquarters. Meanwhile the SEC said HP's subsidiary in Russia had also paid more than $2m through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multimillion-dollar contract with the federal prosecutor's office. The corruption is said to have occurred from 2000 to 2007. In Mexico, as part of a bid to win a software sale to the state petroleum company, an HP subsidiary paid more than $1m in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, and the money, referred to internally as an \"influencer fee\", is said to have been funnelled to one of those officials. Kara Brockmeyer, of the SEC enforcement division, said: \"Hewlett-Packard lacked the internal controls to stop a pattern of illegal payments to win business in Mexico and Eastern Europe. The company's books and records reflected the payments as legitimate commissions and expenses. \"Companies have a fundamental obligation to ensure that their internal controls are both reasonably designed and appropriately implemented across their entire business operations, and they should take a hard look at the agents conducting business on their behalf.\" US regulators have launched a wide-ranging probe into the behaviour of US IT companies abroad. IBM said last year it was under investigation in Poland and four other countries, and the company paid $10m, also in 2013, to settle a corruption case involving China and South Korea. Cisco said last month the company and its resellers in Russia, eastern Europe and central Asia are being investigated. Poland has been pursuing allegations of corruption against a group of multinational IT companies, covering a period from 2007 to 2009. The probe is now drawing to a head, with officials saying on Wednesday that 41 people, including IT company executives, government officials and former police officers, had been charged with almost 70 offences. The interior minister, Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, took to the radio to hail a \"breakthrough moment in Poland when a great international company acknowledges its corrupt activities in Poland\". Under the US's Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal to bribe foreign government officials, HP or individuals involved in the case could be subject to penalties of up to $725,000 per violation and the company could be forced to hand back any profits. If found guilty of criminal offences, the penalty could rise to $25m per violation. John Schultz, an executive vice-president and general counsel at HP, said: \"The misconduct described in the settlement was limited to a small number of people who are no longer employed by the company. HP fully cooperated with both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the investigation of these matters.\"",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Lord Myners quits Co-operative Group", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group was in chaos on Wednesday night after the man brought in only four months ago to reform the troubled chain of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies quit the board. Lord Myners tendered his resignation in the face of mounting opposition to his plan to reform the way the country's biggest mutual is run. On course to report a \u00a32bn loss next week, the Co-op has been mired in turmoil since it emerged its bank had a \u00a31.5bn hole in its balance sheet last May and its former chairman, the Reverend Paul Flowers, was embroiled in a scandal involving class A drugs. Myners, who was chairman of the Guardian Media Group until 2008 when he joined the Labour government at the height of the financial crisis, was brought in with a mandate to draw up a blue print for a new-look Co-op. His resignation came hours after members of the Co-op voted to remove the three directors who approved the controversial \u00a36.6m pay packet for chief executive Euan Sutherland who quit last month after the deal was leaked to the Observer. Myners has faced overwhelming opposition for his plans to reform the Group \u2013 which include tearing up the existing boardroom structure and replacing it with a plc style model. He has referred to \"bullying\" tactics he has faced since joining the board in December and a warning from one influential member of the board that they could block his plans to reform the Group which need the backing of two thirds of the votes. The former City minister is thought to be staying on to complete his controversial review, which is unlikely to be accepted by the regional boards and independent societies that run the organisation. The three directors who were voted off were Liz Moyle, Steven Bayes and Patrick Grange who all had seats on the remuneration committee that approved the \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal for Sutherland, when he was appointed boss of the group 10 months ago. The three who lost their seats are also representatives of the regional boards which control 78% of the votes at annual meetings and will also have a major role in approving the reforms being proposed by Myners who is the only independent director on the board. The changes to the board are thought be the result of a vote by the 900 members who sit on the influential area committees that represent the views of the seven million owner-members of the UK's largest mutual and in turn feed in to the regional boards. Five new directorships were up for election, including filling the seat vacated by former chairman Len Wardle who quit at the height of the Group's troubles last year after Flowers was filmed handing over cash for illegal drugs. One position was vacant because Stuart Ramsay retired. Myners is proposing scrapping the current boardroom structure which currently comprises 15 representatives from the regions \u2013 including a farmer, a university lecturer and a nurse \u2013 and five from the independent societies. Until Wednesday night it also included Myners who only took on the role \u2013 for a salary of \u00a31 \u2013 in December. He was first the non-executive independent director and is accustomed to financial crises, playing a central role in the government response to the banking crisis and in the removal of Fred Goodwin from the top of Royal Bank of Scotland when the bank was facing collapse. The largest independent Co-op, the Midcounties, had voted on Monday night against the reform package. The chair of the Co-op Group is also from an independent society, Ursula Lidbetter, and runs the Lincolnshire Co-operative. Other independent societies were not speaking publicly on Wednesday on whether they backed the stance of the influential Midcounties. But Myners remains under pressure to rewrite his reform plans following the intervention of Midcounties and the seven regional boards that held meetings last weekend at which concerns were raised about the proposals. Under his proposals \u2013 rushed out in the wake of Sutherland's resignation and not yet finalised \u2013 the members of the Co-op would no longer sit on the board but be represented by a members' council. Sutherland was one of eight members of the executive team to be handed \"retention payments\" equivalent to the size of their salaries. Sutherland was on a \u00a31.5m salary and had been promised two retention payments of \u00a31.5m for 2013 and 2014. His current stand-in, former WM Morrison's finance director Richard Pennycook, has a \u00a3900,000 salary and a retention package for 2013 and 2014. He is under pressure to reject the payouts. The bank is preparing to reveal the pay deal of the boss of its bank, Niall Booker, who was part of the team assembled by Sutherland when the financial problems in the bank were uncovered last May. Last month Booker admitted the Co-op bank needed another \u00a3400m to cover the cost of mis-selling scandals. But this means the debt-laden Group needs to find another \u00a3120m if it is to prevent its stake in the bank falling below 30%. But it is not yet clear if it will put up the cash as next week its expected to report losses of at least \u00a32bn.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Next is to share his \u00a34m bonus among the retailer's staff in the equivalent of a 1.5% pay rise for employees. On Wednesday Simon Wolfson wrote to the company's 20,000 staff to tell them he would share one of his bonuses with employees who had worked for the company since April 2011. The retailer's financial performance is set to overtake Marks &amp; Spencer for the first time after it announced annual profits of \u00a3695m. Next's multimillionaire boss is in line for a further windfall of more than \u00a34m when his annual pay and bonuses are revealed on Friday. It is the second year running that Lord Wolfson, who was paid \u00a34.6m last year and holds \u00a3100m worth of Next shares, has shared his \"Share Matching Plan\" bonus with staff. \"In 2011, the board awarded me an incentive scheme called a share matching plan. The value of this bonus was closely linked to the value of the company's shares,\" he said in the letter. \"In the last three years, thanks to everybody's hard work, Next has grown its profits per share 65% and the company's shares have trebled.\" The bonus, which staff will collect in their May pay will be paid on a pro rata basis equivalent to 1.5% of salary. It means shopfloor workers who are paid \u00a36.33 per hour \u2013 2p more than the minimum wage \u2013 will collect an extra \u00a3197.49 if they work a 40-hour week. From June, Next's minimum pay will increase by 37p to \u00a36.70. Despite the pay rise, staff are planning protests demanding that Next pay the living wage of \u00a37.65 an hour, or \u00a38.80 in London. Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB union, which represents Next shopfloor staff, said: \"This pay rise, while welcome, will place Next staff 0.18p above national minimum rate of \u00a36.50 from 1 October. This is well below a living wage.\" On Friday, the company is likely to reveal in its annual report that Wolfson, 46, who has run Next since he was 33 when he became the youngest chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, will collect two bonuses worth more than \u00a31m. Wolfson, who is married to Eleanor Shawcross, George Osborne's economic adviser, could collect an \"annual bonus\" of up to 150% of his \u00a3715,000 basic salary, and millions more under the company's long-term incentive plan (LTIP). Last year, after forsaking his share matching plan bonus, he still collected total pay of \u00a34.6m because of a \u00a31m annual bonus and a \u00a32.5m LTIP. Despite his fortune, Wolfson is said to spurn expensive City lunches in favour of \"a plate of boiled potatoes with some greens\".",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece will make a successful return to the financial markets on Thursday after investors flocked to its first sale of government bonds since the eurozone crisis flared up four years ago. There was strong demand for a new five-year bond, despite the country being gripped by its first anti-austerity general strike of 2014. By early evening Athens had received more than \u20ac11bn (\u00a39bn) of bids, pushing down the interest rate it will pay on the debt at Thursday's sale towards just 5%. The general strike disrupted transport services, schools and hospitals in Greece, with thousands of people marching past the parliament building. The private sector GSEE union urged Antonis Samaras's government to change its austerity programme, and ditch the \"dead-end policies that have squeezed workers and made Greek people miserable\". Greece could raise as much as \u20ac2.5bn from the bond sale, those close to the deal say, a sign of confidence two years after Greece came close to crashing out of the euro. The country received bailouts totalling more than \u20ac200bn from the IMF and EU. The strong demand sparked a rally in eurozone sovereign debt in the bond markets, driving up the price at which Greece's 10-year bonds were changing hands \u2013 and therefore driving down the yield. Some fund managers warned, though, that Greece still faces serious challenges in the years ahead. Paul McNamara, investment director at fund manager GAM, cautioned that Greece will only be able to repay the bonds in 2019 if it sticks with the economic reform plans agreed with international lenders. \"For Greece to be paying in full and on time in five years is dependent on them staying on good terms with the Troika and sticking with the (IMF) programme. A yield of around 5% feels low for what, for us, seems like a speculative investment,\" said McNamara. Jon Jonsson, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, told the Wall Street Journal that he was \"unlikely\" to take part in the sale, as the low yields did not reflect the risk of buying Greek debt. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have all been hired to handle the debt auction. Danske Bank's dealer Owen Callan has predicted that a successful sale will help other eurozone countries, telling Reuters: \"Yields in Portugal, Italy, Spain and Ireland are no longer just compared to what is below them, but also now to what is above them. As Greek yields fall, that should help provide further momentum in these markets.\" On Friday, German chancellor Angela Merkel will visit Athens in a show of solidarity with the country which has suffered the most since the eurozone debt crisis began. Odysseus Trivalas, president of the public sector union Adedy, said civil servants will hold a protest rally to mark Merkel's visit. \"What everyone has to know is that unions in Greece are going to intensify protest action in the run-up to the European elections,\" Trivalas added.",

There are a number of countries that could do more. You know, Germany obviously is one of the surplus countries in Europe. I think you know, there are-- if you look at Europe as a whole, the growth rate has stayed very modest. The risk of deflation is something that has a lot of people concerned. And, you know, the answers lie in, I think, policy decisions that could be taken. That's actually the good news. There are solutions that would help.</p> <p>...The policies that we're talking about in the United States - things like investing in infrastructure, those are the kinds of things that stimulate demand. So it's a good thing in Germany that in their new government they made a commitment to increase spending on infrastructure.</p> <p>You know, this is a question of not if you take action but how you turn the dial.

Writing for the Guardian he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>During my current trip to Europe, I have been encouraged by the hope and deeper sense of economic and financial calm that has arrived this spring. With risk spreads compressing markedly, the region's financial crisis has been relegated to the history books, and the region is again attracting the interest of foreign investors. Consumer confidence is recovering as well, and businesses are again looking to expand, albeit cautiously. Economic growth has picked up and unemployment, while still alarmingly high, has stopped increasing in most countries.</p> <p>...Rather than disrupt its growing confidence and composure, the Ukrainian crisis has been a catalyst for renewed political co-operation and solidarity within western Europe. It has also fostered closer relations with the US ...</p> <p>But ....a few things need to happen rather quickly \u2013 specifically, over the next several weeks and months \u2013 if the continent is to minimise the risk of slipping into another prolonged period of underperformance and additional asymmetrical downside financial risk.</p> <p>Let us start with the immediate geopolitical threat. To put it bluntly, Europe's economy, and even more so the economies of Russia and Ukraine, is not particularly well positioned to weather a further disorderly escalation of tensions. </p> <p>Second, the <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html\" style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);\">European Central Bank</a> needs to pivot from financial crisis prevention \u2013 an area where it has performed impressively \u2013 to striking the delicate balance of supporting growth (and countering currency over-appreciation) without fuelling excessive risk taking.</p> <p>Third, with European institutions acting as catalysts, political leaders will need to reinforce efforts to place the eurozone as a whole on a firm footing. This requires complimenting monetary union with deeper political integration, better fiscal co-ordination (where progress has been painfully slow), and <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-14-77_en.htm?locale=en\">a proper banking union (last month's agreement should be treated as a stepping stone, not the ultimate destination)</a>.</p> <p>Fourth, at the national level, individual countries need to continue to rebalance their policies with a view to achieving the trifecta of structural reforms, solid aggregate demand and fewer debt overhangs.</p> <p>Finally, anti-establishment parties must not dominate the European parliament elections in May. Most of these parties are committed to greater national isolation and, at least initially, would work hard to halt and reverse recent gains made on regional economic and financial integration.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full piece is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/09/europe-economy-difficult-spring-russia-ukraine?CMP=twt_fd\">Europe faces a difficult spring, but its to-do list is achievable</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53455844e4b06807fd8c4f09\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-09T14:44:51.610Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While investors flocked to Greece's new bond offering, protesters gathered outside the Athens parliament and unveiled a banner reading <b>\"People will Win\"</b>.</p> <p>Here's a few more photos from today's anti-austerity protests:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-883650bb-abb6-4b2c-aac8-4a8746e1c048\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/9/1397053505692/86a14f64-4373-4255-8a87-1c1b0bf6dd1f-460x280.jpeg\" alt=\"Protestors hold up a banner that says \"People will Win\"  as riot police officers protect the Parliament building during a labour strike on April 9, 2014 in Athens, Greece.\" width=\"460\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Milos Bicanski/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5f4dc8bd-4373-4e3e-a324-58f8eb94a605\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/9/1397054348635/2d058e47-f287-4d75-b80d-a083cf73a4d7-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Riot police officers walks in front of the Greek Parliament during massive anti-austerity demonstrations in Athens.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riot police officers walks in front of the Greek Parliament.

      "bodyText": "After recent declines, investors indulged in a spate of bargain hunting to push markets higher, writes Nick Fletcher. The move higher came despite continuing worries about the tensions in Ukraine, and ahead of the publication of the latest US Federal Reserve minutes. So by the close: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 44.92 points or 0.68% higher at 6635.61 \u2022 Germany's Dax edged up 0.16% to 9506.35 \u2022 France's Cac climbed 0.4% to 4442.68 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.23% better at 21,717.02 \u2022 Spain's Ibex managed a 0.04% gain to 10,485.2 \u2022 But the Athens market dipped 0.5% despite 10 year bond yields falling to 5.755% In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 86 points or 0.5%. And on that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow with (among other things) more from the IMF and the Bank of England's latest rate and QE announcement. European countries with a surplus, such as Germany, should do more to boost economic demand, according to US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. Speaking in an interview with CNBC, he said: We've been very clear in our conversations with our European friends that we think that particularly in surplus countries there is a need to boost demand. You know, there's a demand problem in the world and there's a demand problem in Europe. When asked if he meant Germany specifically, he said: Look, I've always been careful not to point a finger, you know, at one or another. There are a number of countries that could do more. You know, Germany obviously is one of the surplus countries in Europe. I think you know, there are-- if you look at Europe as a whole, the growth rate has stayed very modest. The risk of deflation is something that has a lot of people concerned. And, you know, the answers lie in, I think, policy decisions that could be taken. That's actually the good news. There are solutions that would help. ...The policies that we're talking about in the United States - things like investing in infrastructure, those are the kinds of things that stimulate demand. So it's a good thing in Germany that in their new government they made a commitment to increase spending on infrastructure. You know, this is a question of not if you take action but how you turn the dial. We think that the risk of low demand and the risk of deflation is something that they need to be very alert to and they need to take a little more, not a little less. Europe's recovery is gaining ground despite the nearby crisis in the Ukraine, but there are still a number of actions required to maintain its progress, says Mohamed A El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. Writing for the Guardian he says: During my current trip to Europe, I have been encouraged by the hope and deeper sense of economic and financial calm that has arrived this spring. With risk spreads compressing markedly, the region's financial crisis has been relegated to the history books, and the region is again attracting the interest of foreign investors. Consumer confidence is recovering as well, and businesses are again looking to expand, albeit cautiously. Economic growth has picked up and unemployment, while still alarmingly high, has stopped increasing in most countries. ...Rather than disrupt its growing confidence and composure, the Ukrainian crisis has been a catalyst for renewed political co-operation and solidarity within western Europe. It has also fostered closer relations with the US ... But ....a few things need to happen rather quickly \u2013 specifically, over the next several weeks and months \u2013 if the continent is to minimise the risk of slipping into another prolonged period of underperformance and additional asymmetrical downside financial risk. Let us start with the immediate geopolitical threat. To put it bluntly, Europe's economy, and even more so the economies of Russia and Ukraine, is not particularly well positioned to weather a further disorderly escalation of tensions. Second, the European Central Bank needs to pivot from financial crisis prevention \u2013 an area where it has performed impressively \u2013 to striking the delicate balance of supporting growth (and countering currency over-appreciation) without fuelling excessive risk taking. Third, with European institutions acting as catalysts, political leaders will need to reinforce efforts to place the eurozone as a whole on a firm footing. This requires complimenting monetary union with deeper political integration, better fiscal co-ordination (where progress has been painfully slow), and a proper banking union (last month's agreement should be treated as a stepping stone, not the ultimate destination). Fourth, at the national level, individual countries need to continue to rebalance their policies with a view to achieving the trifecta of structural reforms, solid aggregate demand and fewer debt overhangs. Finally, anti-establishment parties must not dominate the European parliament elections in May. Most of these parties are committed to greater national isolation and, at least initially, would work hard to halt and reverse recent gains made on regional economic and financial integration. The full piece is here: Europe faces a difficult spring, but its to-do list is achievable While investors flocked to Greece's new bond offering, protesters gathered outside the Athens parliament and unveiled a banner reading \"People will Win\". Here's a few more photos from today's anti-austerity protests: Reuters is reporting that Greece has received no less than \u20ac11bn worth of bids for its new five-year bonds -- much more than the \u20ac2bn it was initially expected to sell. Strong demand, which explains why analysts are suggesting that the bonds could be sold at an interest rate of just 5% - as Athens can cherry-pick the best offers. A remarkable show of faith in Greece, given the challenges ahead? Chris Adams of the Financial Times has another theory: Let's move back to the big story of the day - Greece's sale of a new five-year bonds for the first time since 2010. Paul McNamara, investment director at fund manager GAM, explains that investors who take part in tomorrow's auction will be calculating that Athens sticks with its economic reform plan and maintains the support of its international lenders until the bonds mature and are repaid in 2019. He told me: \"For Greece to be paying in full and on time in five years is dependent on them staying on good terms with the Troika and sticking with the programme.\" Athens' priority is to show that it has access to the financial markets; as Ireland did last year as it exited its bailout. Paul added: \"A yield of around 5% feels low for what, for us, seems like a speculative investment.\" Jon Jonsson, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, questioned the value being place on Greek debt. Jonsson told the Wall Street Journal that: \"At a yield of around 5.25% for a five-year bond, I don't think I am being adequately compensated for the risk of buying Greek bonds... \"The deal is obviously good for the euro-zone periphery but we are unlikely to take part in the deal.\" And Danske Bank's Owen Callan has predicted that a successful sales will help other eurozone countries, telling Reuters: \"Yields in Portugal, Italy, Spain and Ireland are no longer just compared to what is below them, but also now to what is above them. As Greek yields fall, that should help provide further momentum in these markets.\" Asked about the situation in the eurozone, IMF financial councillor Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als said that progress has been made towards repairing the region's financial system. He cited the increased 'core tier 1' capital ratios, which boosted confidence in the sector. Vi\u00f1als added that it is important that the Eurozone's Asset Quality Review, and stress tests, are \"very rigorous\" and that deficiencies are dealt with. If a bank needs more funding, it should turn first to the private sector, then to its national government if needed, and in a last resort to the Euopean backstop facility (which is being created over the next eight years) he said. UK authorities must be vigilant against the risk that Britain's housing market overheats, says IMF financial councillor Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als. Speaking at today's press conference (livefeed) on the IMF's Global Financial Stability report, Vi\u00f1als said that \"macro-prudential authorities\" must take the necessary measures if it concludes that house market is too hot. Asked about the risks of a housing bubble, Vi\u00f1als replied that UK had seen a significant increase in house prices as the economy recovers and unemployment falls. But mortgage servicing levels are still very low, he pointed out, so policymakers must watch the situation carefully. Vi\u00f1als said: This is something that requires vigilance on the behalf of the authorities. It is for the macro-prudential authorities to take the necessary measures, if and when they decide that the housing market in the UK is getting too hot. The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee is responsible for monitoring financial stability in the UK, so a potential housing bubble would fall under its remit. Onto questions - and Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als is asked about the Federal Reserve's tapering programme (through which it is cutting its bond-buying scheme). He says that the Fed has helped to calm the markets, and cut volatility, when it explained that tapering was not the same as tightening monetary policy. Our baseline scenario is that the exit from the Fed's loose monetary policy stance is smooth, Vi\u00f1als says. But emerging markets must make preparations in case it is not smooth, by strengthening their economies and finances. The IMF has also warned that global companies may have become dangerously reliant on rock-bottom interest rates, and some could suffer serious problems when borrowing costs rise. It says that companies in some parts of the eurozone area remain highly leveraged, while US companies are less exposed, but have been increasing their borrowing levels. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1alsexplained in the press conference (live feed) that many firms in emerging markets could also struggle in a future world of higher interest rates and lower earnings. Sky News has more details: The IMF said that the amount of cash spent on leveraged loans - the high-debt instruments with financial problems - now exceeds the level in 2007 before the crisis. The same is the case with covenant-lite loans, which have are more lax than normal debt - they are also being created at a significantly faster rate than in 2007. From Washington, our economic correspondent Phillip Inman reports on the IMF's Global Financial Stability report: The eurozone's creaking banking system poses a serious threat to global financial stability, according to the International Monetary Fund which warned European leaders to accelerate plans to support weak banks and create a banking union. In a report that forecasts a \"goldilocks\" outcome of stable growth, IMF financial counsellor Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als said the end of low interest rates in the US, coupled with a failure by the Obama administration to monitor risky lending, a sharp slowdown in China and disruption to emerging markets could all upset expectations of a smooth recovery. \"Can the US make a smooth exit from unconventional policies? I call this the 'Goldilocks exit' \u2013 not too hot, not too cold, just right. This is our base line, most likely outcome. After a turbulent start, the normalisation of monetary policy has begun. But a bumpy exit is possible.\" Here's Phillip's full story: IMF warns Europe's banking system poses threat to global financial stability The IMF is presenting the Global Financial Stability Report now - here's the webcast. Here's the IMF's global stability map, just released. It shows how emerging market risks have increased in the last six months, but risks posed by the credit market and monetary and financial conditions has decreased. Breaking: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economy has not made adequate preparations for the end of America's ultra-loose monetary policy. In its new Global Financial Stability Report, just released in Washington, the IMF said: The scaling back of certain extraordinary policy supports has not been accompanied by adequate preparations for a new environment of normalized, self-sustaining growth. Many advanced economies have been unable to sufficiently reduce pre-crisis debt loads\u2014 indeed, in general they have increased public indebtedness. The Fund identified the eurozone's banking sector as a key threat. It also warned that emerging market risks have increased in the last six months, as the Federal Reserve 'tapers' its bond-buying programme which has been pumping tens of billions of dollars into the global economy each month. The IMF said: In the euro area, a pickup in growth has brightened prospects, although high debt, low inflation, and financial fragmentation still present downside risks. However, the growth outlook for emerging market economies has been somewhat lowered by tightening external conditions coupled with some tightening of policy rates amid rising domestic vulnerabilities. Together, these developments leave macroeconomic risks unchanged. More to follow! Greek 10-year bond yields just fell through the 6% level as bond prices push to levels last seen four years ago. Drama in the Irish courts, where the former chairman of Anglo Irish bank has been cleared of six charges he faced over its collapse, but he still faces another 10 charges. From Dublin, Henry McDonald report: A judge in Dublin has directed a jury to find Anglo Irish banker Sean Fitzpatrick not guilty of illegally providing loans to the family of Ireland's one time richest man Sean Quinn. In a dramatic intervention in the case against Fitzpatrick and two other executives from the now defunct bank, the jury in court number of the Dublin Circuit Court were also told to find Pat Whelan, the former head of lending for Ireland at Anglo, not guilty of being privy to a fraudulent loan application. \"For good reason I have directed not guilty verdicts,\" Judge Nolan told jurors. \"It will all be made apparent to you in due course.\" FitzPatrick still faces ten charges of illegally loaning money to the so called Maple Ten group of wealthy investors to buy shares in the bank in the summer of 2008. This deal was designed to unwind Se\u00e1n Quinn's 29.4% control of Anglo which officials at the bank believed was driving down the share price. Whelan and former Anglo Director of Finance William McAteer also still face these charges as well as six charges relating to the loaning of money to the Quinn family. All three are accused are charged at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court with breaching Section 60 of the Irish Republic's Companies Act 1963 by lending money to investors to buy shares in Anglo. The trio deny all the charges levelled at them and the trial now enters its tenth week with the defence considering if it will call witnesses to the trial. Over on FT Alphaville, Joseph Cotterill has posted the details of the Greek bond sale. It confirms that, for example, the bonds mature on 17 April 2019, and the indications of interest (IOIs) are being collected today. Interestingly, the bonds are also being issued under English law rather than Greek law -- which means investors are protected from the risk of Athens imposing a haircut in future years. Joseph (an expert on the nitty-gritty of bond law) comments: It would be English law \u2013 Greece\u2019s existing restructured bonds are governed by it, for example, and there probably are other good technical reasons to use the jurisdiction. And Greece may wish to be seen to be selling its triumphant market return to international buyers, and less to its own banks. But for an investor aware of how local law bonds enabled Greece to carry out its sweeping restructuring in 2012, perhaps there is just a smidgen of comfort here. We still don't have a price -- but there are rumours that the bonds could sell at a yield of around 5.25%. A City fund manager points out that one large investment bank, Citi, hasn't got onto the ticket for the Greek bond sale -- perhaps Athens remembered that its chief economist Willem Buiter coined the term \"Grexit\" back in 2010. Greece's landmark debt sale is moving forwards - six investment banks chosen to sell the new five-year bond have reportedly been chosen: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley. Union leaders have denied that there is a disappointing turnout at today's general strike. Odysseus Trivalas, president of the civil servants' union ADEDY, puts turn-out for the one-day strike at around 70 percent. Helena Smith reports: \"In the public sector it's definitely around 70 percent,\" Trivalas reckoned. \"Participation in the rally and march [to parliament] was very good.\" The unionist said that civil servants would be taking to the streets again on Friday to coincide with Angela Merkel's visit to the capital. \"As ADEDY we took the decision last night to rally in Athens,\" he told me .\"GSEE [which represents private sector employees] will decide today whether they will take part.\" \"What everyone has to know is that unions in Greece are going to intensify protest action in the run-up to the European elections,\" Trivalas said. European stock markets are rallying a little this morning, as traders put the wobbles of Monday and Tuesday behind them. The FTSE 100 is up 50 points, a gain of 0.75%, to 6640 - led by Tullow Oil (+3%) and housebuilder Barratt (2.75%). Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, reckons the City is in a sunnier mood, and wondering whether the corporate earnings season (which began this week) will bring good news. After the FTSE suffered for the first couple of days of this week, it has staged a remarkable recovery in early Wednesday trading... This more optimistic outlook has been replicated around Europe, as traders conscious of the potential boost the US reporting season might bring have decided this outweighs their worries over the escalations in Ukraine. The German DAX has risen 0.3%, and the French CAC has gained almost 0.5%. Here's Nick Fletcher's latest market report: FTSE 100 recovers some lost ground but Admiral and motor insurers go into reverse In the financial markets, Greek sovereign debt has strengthened in value again - a good sign for tomorrow's sale of new five-year bonds. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Greek debt has dropped to below 6.1%, down from 6.18% last night -- showing traders see it as an increasingly safe bet. From Athens, Helena confirms that attendance at today's protest march (photos here) was lower than on previous strike days -- and also reports that there are a lot of strike breakers. Pharmacies, which were meant to participate in the 24-hour walk-out, have clearly resisted doing so with many keeping their doors open, not least in the city centre, she says. Mary Papadopoulou, who owns a pharmacy in the ancient Plaka district, beneath the Acropolis, summed up the mood: \"We've had so many strikes and where has it got us? Nowhere! We've all got debts and taxes to pay. How am I going to paying the haratsi [property tax] on this building if I go on strike?\" Papadopoulou added that she would not be joining any strike action \"ever again.\" Culture ministry officials have also ensured that archaeological sites have been kept open for visiting tourists. Greece is expecting a record number of holiday-makers this year, with one in five Greek jobs dependent on tourism. Another photo of the protest march in Athens: Members of Greece's communist union, PAME, have marched past the parliament in Athens, as part of today's 24-hour anti-austerity general strike. The demonstration appears peaceful, and not as well attended as during the large protests in 2011 and 2012. Overnight, the GSEE union issued a statement explaining why the walkout was necessary: This is our answer to the dead-end policies that have squeezed workers and made Greek people miserable. We are striking and fighting to put an end to austerity\". But after so many years, and so many protests, public support for such demonstrations appears to have waned. As Reuters put it: The GSEE and ADEDY unions have staged dozens of strikes since Greece's first bailout in 2010, saying the measures prescribed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund have hit the poor and worsened its six-year recession. But protests have largely fizzled out, with low turnout blamed on a growing mood of resignation and protest fatigue. Political analysts will be watching the turnout in Wednesday's street protests. Greek finance ministry sources have now confirmed to us that an announcement will be made later today about the bond sale, which will take place tomorrow. Reuters reckons Athens will try to raise \u20ac2.5bn, more than the \u20ac2bn which had been rumoured. The Wall Street Journal reckons we'll get the details of Greece's bond sale later today, although it won't actually take place until tomorrow. Has Greece's battered industrial sector turned the corner? New data from statistics body ELSTAT shows that industrial production rose by 1.7% year-on-year in February. Just the kind of data that might persuade an international investor to take part in Greece's debt auction. But as this graph shows, the sector is around 30% smaller than back in 2005, ravaged by the recession that began six years ago. Here's some instant reaction to the news that the Greek bond sale has been pushed back until tomorrow, according to various government sources. Back to Greece, where government officials are denying that investment bankers are beginning to take orders for its first long-term bond since 2010, our correspondent Helena Smith says. And bankers contacted by the Guardian are calling news of the market foray \u201crumours.\u201d. One banker told Helena: \u201cI really can\u2019t corroborate that\u201d. Aides to Greece\u2019s deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos have just that \u201cas far\u201d as they know the country will return to capital markets on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s what the finance ministry is telling us,\u201d said one, speaking on strict condition of anonymity. As a former finance minister who oversaw Greece\u2019s private sector debt restructuring, Venizelos, perhaps more than anyone in Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party coalition, is watching the market foray closely. Naftemboriki, the financial daily, described the Athens Stock exchange as being all \u201cwait and see.\u201d And Reuters just issued a newsflash, saying that its sources also believe the bond sale will take place on Thursday: GREECE EXPECTED TO BRING FIVE-YEAR EURO BOND ON THURSDAY - SOURCES GRGOVT.UL - IFR Britain's trade gap narrowed in February, as both imports and exports fell. The ONS reports that the UK goods balance fell to \u00a39.09bn, down from \u00a39.463bn. And Britain's traditional surplus in the Service sector also fell, to \u00a37.036bn from \u00a37.26bn. That means that the total UK trade balance shrank to \u00a32.05bn, from \u00a32.203bn in January. The amount of goods exported by British firms decreased by 1.6% between January and February 2014 to \u00a323.5 billion. Imports fell by 2.2% to \u00a332.6 billion -- mainly due to fewer imports of aircraft, precious stones and silver. Without these 'erratics', imports decreased by 0.6%. The Office for National Statistics pointed out that the less volatile three-month on three-month data also showed that Britain's trade deficit shrunk sharply over the winter. The total trade deficit has almost halved in the three months to February 2014 compared with the previous three months, from \u00a38.7 billion to \u00a34.8 billion, mainly due to a narrowing of the trade in goods deficit. Exports from Britain to the European Union (EU) fell by \u00a30.3 billion to \u00a311.7bn, due to a drop in the value of fuel sales. Imports from the EU increased by \u00a30.3 billion to \u00a317.8 billion, mainly due to imports of finished manufactures which rose \u00a30.2bn from the previous month, the ONS said. The French government is keeping the pressure on Brussels to allow a further relaxation of its debt targets. France's new prime minister, Manuel Valls, said this morning he would \"clarify\" in the coming days the pace at which the country would reduce its public deficit. Reuters has the details: Valls unveiled planned tax and public spending cuts on Tuesday, vowing to bring France's public deficit down while resisting outright austerity. \"We will detail our budget trajectory in the next few days,\" Valls told BFM TV. When asked if he would request that the European Union grant more time to bring France's deficit down from 4.3 percent of GDP to 3 percent by 2015, Valls said: \"There are discussions with [French Finance Minister] Michel Sapin and [EU] Commissioner Olli Rehn.\" The latest trade data for the UK is released in around 15 minutes time, and will show whether Britain made much progress in reducing the gap between imports and exports in February, after seeing it widen in January. We've already had data from Germany, showing that seasonally adjusted exports fell by 1.3% month-on-month in February, while imports rose by 0.4%. ING economist Carsten Brzeski fears that Germany was hit by the slowdown in the emerging markets... While the BBC's Gavin Hewitt is encouraged that Germany sucked in more goods from overseas. Greek journalist Efthimia Efthimiou reports that the Greek bond sale is underway, with Athens' investment bankers beginning to take orders.... Greece's archaeological splendours haven't all been blacked out by the general strike, though. Helena reports that skeleton staff are ensuring that tourists are getting to sites, such as these Belgian high school students who right now are at the 1st century BC Tower of the Winds: Over in Athens, my colleague Helena Smith just collared Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras -- but he was playing his cards close to his chest. Asked whether Greece will return to the debt markets today, Stournaras simply replied: We don't know. We don't know. See you. See you. I'm sure we'll hear more from him later.... Today's Greek bond auction is its first foray into the debt markets (excluding short-term T-bill sales) since 2010, when Athens sought its first bailout. It's expected to try to sell around \u20ac2bn of five-year bonds, as CNBC explains: The country is expected to auction around 2 billion euro ($2.78 billion) worth of five-year debt. The yield is expected to be around the 5.4 percent mark, a better investment return than the current 4.79 percent, as authorities want to offer a little sweetener to investors, according to CNBC sources in Athens. Big news in the auto industry this morning-- Toyota has announced one of the largest car recalls in history. The Japanese company is recalling more than six million vehicles worldwide to fix a number of faults to crucial components, including steering wheels, airbags, seat rails and starter motors. Many of the cars were sold in the US, but it includes around 300,000 in Australia and 35,000 in Britain. It covers 29 models in all, and is the biggest recall since Toyota hauled back 7.4m vehicles to be fixed in October 2012. Here's our full story: Toyota recalls 6.5m cars over steering and seat problems A few photos of travellers hit by today's strike: Today's general strike has already halted train and ferry services in Greece. Schools also haven't opened, and public hospitals are running on emergency staff. Here's Associated Press's early take: Wednesday's 24-hour strike is also causing public transport disruptions in Athens, where unionists are planning two separate protest marches to Parliament. Unions say they are seeking an end to the painful belt-tightening policies that successive governments imposed to secure vital international bailouts after Greece nearly went bankrupt in 2010. The repeated income cuts and tax hikes deepened a six-year recession, while unemployment has reached a record 28 percent. But signs are increasing that things are slowly improving, with the economy expected to return to growth this year and the government planning a return to capital markets for the first time in four years. Today's strike is a signal to the Greek government that the unions remain \"totally opposed\" to its austerity programme, explains Odysseus Trivalas, head of the public sector union ADEDY. Trivalas told our correspondent Helena Smith that: \u201cOur aim is to show the government that we remain totally opposed to policies that it continues to pass. \u201cOnly last week parliament endorsed more measures that break collective workers' agreements and will see another 25,000 civil servants losing their jobs. It will be a very big protest.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Today could be a dramatic day for Greece, both on the streets and in the debt markets. Unions have called a general strike that could bring parts of the country to a standstill, in the first large anti-austerity walkout of 2014. Hospital staff, transport workers, teachers and court employees are all expected to join in the strike, in a signal to Athens of their ongoing opposition to its economic programme. Protests marches are expected in the capital in the hours ahead. A scene we've witnessed many times since Greece's debt crisis began, around four years ago. But this time it's different -- because Greece is also planning to hold its first sale of longer-term sovereign debt in several years. Athens will put its toe, gingerly perhaps, back into the financial markets by selling five-year bonds. If that sale is a success, it would be an important landmark in Greece's trouble journey since 2010. Deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos has already declared it would be \"a very big step towards normality\". Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen, agrees that the bond sale is a good sign, both for Greece and the wider eurozone. He said: \"They\u2019re taking advantage of the improved confidence in Europe \u201cIt\u2019s a good demonstration of how things have improved. Of course not everything\u2019s been solved.\u201d Indeed, as a glance at Greece's record unemployment figures and still-shrinking economy will testify..... Also coming up today... the International Monetary Fund releases its new Financial Stability report, which will identify the biggest threats to the global recovery. That's due at 2pm BST (9am Washington time). And investors will be watching global stock markets nervously, after a few volatile days in which technology stocks have been pounded.",

      "body": "<p>During my current trip to Europe, I have been encouraged by the hope and deeper sense of economic and financial calm that has arrived this spring. With risk spreads compressing markedly, the region's financial crisis has been relegated to the history books, and the region is again attracting the interest of foreign investors. Consumer confidence is recovering as well, and businesses are again looking to expand, albeit cautiously. Economic growth has picked up and unemployment, while still alarmingly high, has stopped increasing in most countries.</p> <p>Remarkably, all of this is occurring in the context of a major geopolitical crisis to the east, following what the Financial Times rightly pointed out constitutes \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d93e4c7c-ae6d-11e3-8e41-00144feab7de.html#axzz2yOeHgAzu\" title=\"\">the first annexation of another European country's territory since the second world war</a>\". Equally disturbing, Russia's annexation of Crimea has occurred with stunning ease \u2013 indeed, simply \"with the stroke of a pen,\" as the FT put it. And neither western Europe nor the United States can even pretend to provide a military counterweight to Russian actions in Ukraine.</p> <p>Yet, rather than disrupt its growing confidence and composure, the Ukrainian crisis has been a catalyst for renewed political co-operation and solidarity within western Europe. It has also fostered closer relations with the US at a time when political leaders face inevitable headwinds in completing historic negotiations on the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\" title=\"\">proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)</a>, aimed at boosting economic ties in a manner consistent with a strengthened multilateral system.</p> <p>Europe badly needs all of this good economic and financial news. The region has only just exited a recession that has devastated many livelihoods. Far too many citizens are still trapped in <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdsc330\" title=\"\">long-term unemployment</a>, while a <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Youth_unemployment\" title=\"\">distressing number of young people struggle to secure a job</a> \u2013 any job.</p> <p>The region's ongoing recovery is also good news for a global economy that has yet to rebalance properly and fire on all available growth cylinders. US growth, while edging up, is still below its potential, let alone high enough to offset prior shortfalls. After a short burst, Japanese growth has begun to sputter. And several systemically important emerging economies (including Brazil, China and Turkey) have slowed, while their transitions to new growth models remain incomplete.</p> <p>But Europe's renewed sense of hope and confidence, however encouraging, is not sufficient \u2013 at least not yet \u2013 to produce appreciable welfare gains for current and future generations. A few things need to happen rather quickly \u2013 specifically, over the next several weeks and months \u2013 if the continent is to minimise the risk of slipping into another prolonged period of underperformance and additional asymmetrical downside financial risk.</p> <p>Let us start with the immediate geopolitical threat. To put it bluntly, Europe's economy, and even more so the economies of Russia and Ukraine, is not particularly well positioned to weather a further disorderly escalation of tensions. Enlightened diplomacy needs to replace the cold war-style posturing and rhetoric that have re-emerged.

      "bodyText": "During my current trip to Europe, I have been encouraged by the hope and deeper sense of economic and financial calm that has arrived this spring. With risk spreads compressing markedly, the region's financial crisis has been relegated to the history books, and the region is again attracting the interest of foreign investors. Consumer confidence is recovering as well, and businesses are again looking to expand, albeit cautiously. Economic growth has picked up and unemployment, while still alarmingly high, has stopped increasing in most countries. Remarkably, all of this is occurring in the context of a major geopolitical crisis to the east, following what the Financial Times rightly pointed out constitutes \"the first annexation of another European country's territory since the second world war\". Equally disturbing, Russia's annexation of Crimea has occurred with stunning ease \u2013 indeed, simply \"with the stroke of a pen,\" as the FT put it. And neither western Europe nor the United States can even pretend to provide a military counterweight to Russian actions in Ukraine. Yet, rather than disrupt its growing confidence and composure, the Ukrainian crisis has been a catalyst for renewed political co-operation and solidarity within western Europe. It has also fostered closer relations with the US at a time when political leaders face inevitable headwinds in completing historic negotiations on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), aimed at boosting economic ties in a manner consistent with a strengthened multilateral system. Europe badly needs all of this good economic and financial news. The region has only just exited a recession that has devastated many livelihoods. Far too many citizens are still trapped in long-term unemployment, while a distressing number of young people struggle to secure a job \u2013 any job. The region's ongoing recovery is also good news for a global economy that has yet to rebalance properly and fire on all available growth cylinders. US growth, while edging up, is still below its potential, let alone high enough to offset prior shortfalls. After a short burst, Japanese growth has begun to sputter. And several systemically important emerging economies (including Brazil, China and Turkey) have slowed, while their transitions to new growth models remain incomplete. But Europe's renewed sense of hope and confidence, however encouraging, is not sufficient \u2013 at least not yet \u2013 to produce appreciable welfare gains for current and future generations. A few things need to happen rather quickly \u2013 specifically, over the next several weeks and months \u2013 if the continent is to minimise the risk of slipping into another prolonged period of underperformance and additional asymmetrical downside financial risk. Let us start with the immediate geopolitical threat. To put it bluntly, Europe's economy, and even more so the economies of Russia and Ukraine, is not particularly well positioned to weather a further disorderly escalation of tensions. Enlightened diplomacy needs to replace the cold war-style posturing and rhetoric that have re-emerged. Further escalation would most likely cause the west to impose deeper economic and (critically) financial sanctions on Russia, followed by Russian counter-sanctions that would disrupt the energy flow to Europe. All of this would tip Europe as a whole into recession and renewed financial turmoil. Second, the European Central Bank needs to pivot from financial crisis prevention \u2013 an area where it has performed impressively \u2013 to striking the delicate balance of supporting growth (and countering currency over-appreciation) without fuelling excessive risk taking. This may well involve renewed experimentation, which would again take many policymakers outside of their comfort zone. Third, with European institutions acting as catalysts, political leaders will need to reinforce efforts to place the eurozone as a whole on a firm footing. This requires complimenting monetary union with deeper political integration, better fiscal co-ordination (where progress has been painfully slow), and a proper banking union (last month's agreement should be treated as a stepping stone, not the ultimate destination). Fourth, at the national level, individual countries need to continue to rebalance their policies with a view to achieving the trifecta of structural reforms, solid aggregate demand and fewer debt overhangs. Finally, anti-establishment parties must not dominate the European parliament elections in May. Most of these parties are committed to greater national isolation and, at least initially, would work hard to halt and reverse recent gains made on regional economic and financial integration. That is quite a to-do list, especially given that it only covers the next few weeks and months. Yet every item on it is achievable, and progress on each would help to ensure that Europe's encouraging spring leads to a bountiful harvest of economic opportunity, growth, and jobs, while reducing the risk of a hot political summer and a more frigid economic winter. \u2022 Mohamed A El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz and a member of its international executive committee.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Toyota is recalling more than 6.5m cars worldwide to fix a variety of problems, including faulty steering wheels and seats. The company said there had been no reported accidents or injuries relating to the problems identified. Some 27 Toyota models are affected, including the Corolla, RAV4, Hilux, Yaris, Tacoma, Urban Cruiser and Scion xD. The global recall tally is a huge blow to the world's biggest selling carmaker that has seen its reputation battered by a string of damaging recalls. Since early 2012, the company has recalled around 20m vehicles and sold 18.7m. The latest recall is not even the biggest in a single day: in October 2012 it was forced to call back 7.43m cars, mostly the Yaris and Corolla models to fix faulty window switches. Toyota's reputation has not fully recovered since a faulty accelerator pedal led to it taking 10m cars off the road in 2009-10. The company later admitted the faults were caused by over-hasty expansion, and last month was fined $1.2bn (\u00a3720m) by US regulators over an investigation into misleading statements the company had made about safety problems with its cars. \"Each announcement puts another dent in Toyota's efforts to recover its reputation and resurrects questions about the impact of its strategy of rapid expansion on previously enviable standards of design and production quality,\" said Peter Shervington, an associate specialising in product liability and recall at Eversheds law firm. More responsive? David Bailey, a car industry expert at Aston Business School in Coventry said Toyota was being more responsive after being \"badly scarred\" by not being seen to respond fast enough to the pedal problems in 2009-10. \"The scale of the [current] recall is a big one but if they can identify a fix and communicate it to customers, customers aren't going to be too bothered.\" Most of the affected cars in the current recall are in North America, with 825,000 in Europe (35,000 in the UK), and 300,000 in Australia, where the recall affects the Hilux \"utes\" and Yaris city cars. In the UK, the recall affects some 25,000 RAV4 and Hilux models bought between June 2004 and December 2010; these cars have a faulty connection from the steering wheel to the airbag, meaning that a certain turn of the wheel could cause the airbag to deactivate. \"If connectivity is lost, the airbag warning light will illuminate on the instrument panel and the driver's airbag may be deactivated,\" the company said. In the US, that problem affects 1.3m vehicles, including certain models of the Corolla. Toyota has also found a problem with the sliding mechanism in the front passenger seat of some models of the Yaris and the Urban Cruiser \u2013 sold in the US as the Scion xD \u2013 meaning they could break with repeated use. \"Should the spring break, the seat may not lock into its adjusted position, and could move in the event of a crash,\" the company said. This problem with the seat mechanism affects 10,263 UK-registered vehicles built between January 2005 and August 2010. Toyota said the recall figure rises to 6.76m when the some models of the Pontiac Vibe and the Subaru Trezia are taken into account. The Pontiac Vibe, a General Motors model, is involved because Toyota and GM made cars at the same plant in California and the recalled model is the same as the Toyota Matrix. Subaru is partly owned by Toyota, and the model was the same as the Toyota Ractis. The company said it would contact customers in the coming weeks to make an appointment for the free repairs. Drivers can check if their vehicle is affected by using a registration number search function on the Toyota website. GM under-fire too The latest recall comes one day after General Motors was accused of \"a culture of cover-up\" by a US senator for failing to own up fast enough to faulty ignition switches implicated in 13 deaths. A source who advises the car industry on recalls, said recalls were getting bigger because car manufacturers were using common components across their range of models. \"The consumer is starting to twig this strategy: they believe they have bought a unique car, but it is actually quite similar to 18 others.\" Transparency over recalls could be improved, the source said, by requiring carmakers in their annual reports \"to discuss their processes and mechanisms to make sure consumers are protected by the highest degree\", as well as better information sharing between international regulators. \"Our drivers are just the same as American drivers, as Japanese drivers, and there is a need for national regulators to agree forceful action on a global footing.\" The car industry's quest for the cheapest components, was also a factor in the recent spate of recalls, said professor Bailey. \"Some companies went for a low-cost, aggressive cost-cutting strategy which went for looking for different components across different parts of the world\u2026 that may be lowest cost but exposes you to more risk when things go wrong.\" Several companies, especially Japanese carmakers, were now reassessing where they source car parts and make their vehicles, Bailey said. \"This offers an opportunity for the UK to re-shore some of its activity and bring it back.\"",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone's creaking banking system poses a serious threat to global financial stability, according to the International Monetary Fund, which warned European leaders to accelerate plans to support weak banks and create a banking union. In a report that forecasts a \"Goldilocks\" outcome of stable growth, IMF financial counsellor Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als said the end of low interest rates in the US, coupled with a failure by the Obama administration to monitor risky lending, a sharp slowdown in China and disruption to emerging markets could all upset expectations of a smooth recovery. \"Can the US make a smooth exit from unconventional policies? I call this the 'Goldilocks exit' \u2013 not too hot, not too cold, just right. \"This is our base line, most likely outcome. After a turbulent start, the normalisation of monetary policy has begun. But a bumpy exit is possible.\" He said the eurozone's incomplete repair of bank and corporate balance sheets continued to place a drag on the recovery, while the widening gap between Germany and the poorest of the 18 member states was restricting the flow of funds around the currency zone and hampering the growth of smaller businesses. \"Thus, further efforts must be made to strengthen bank balance sheets, through the European comprehensive bank assessment and follow-up, and to tackle the corporate debt overhang,\" he said. The IMF, which published the global financial stability report on Wednesday, acts as lender of last resort to bankrupt countries and is one of many economic organisations to worry about the effects on global growth of the US attempting to behave as if the recovery is complete when many countries are still struggling to cope with the aftershocks. Since last May's signal from the US Federal Reserve that interest rates would soon begin to rise, policymakers have been wary of the knock-on effects of a return to more normal rates in the US. The hint by former Fed boss Ben Bernanke caused a flight of investor capital from Turkey, Brazil and South Africa back to the US in the expectation of better returns. Willem Buiter, chief economist at US bank Citi, told an audience at the IMF's spring conference that the US central bank was irresponsible to predict higher interest rates without putting in place insurance plans for countries that will be hit by the increased costs. Buiter said greater co-operation was needed to insulate weaker countries from the ripple effects of policy changes in the US. A refusal by the European Central Bank and its boss Mario Draghi to make borrowing cheaper for local banks was also a concern, he said. \"We talk about the US exiting loose monetary policy and low interest rates, but the eurozone has not yet even entered. Europe is too confident that everything will be OK when its banks are still in need of massive support,\" he said. \"The markets are strong, but investors are still sniffing the glue provided by Draghi and his declaration to do whatever it takes to rescue the euro.\" Buiter said the banking union needed a \u20ac1tn fund to underwrite European banks and not the \u20ac55bn proposed by Brussels. Alistair Darling, the Labour MP and former chancellor of the exchequer, said the banking union was desperately under-capitalised. \"In my experience \u20ac55bn only rescues one bank,\" he said. \"We kid ourselves into believing that it is all over and a banking crisis could never happen again. This is very dangerous. \" Vi\u00f1als also explained that a repeat of the sub-prime loans disaster that sparked the financial crisis was also possible, though less in the housing market and more in the sale of corporate bonds. He said the value of low quality bonds, issued by companies with a high risk of going bust, was more than double the level over the last three years as the amount recorded before the crash. While commending US regulators for being \"on top of this\", he said a panic could increase the costs of financing company debts and trigger a flurry of defaults and a second crisis. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, argued that the US economy was still fragile and in need of huge support from the central bank. Signalling that many members of the Fed board support chair Janet Yellen's doveish stance, he said: \"US unemployment is higher now than it was at its peak in the last recession. US workers are not in as strong a position to withstand shocks and face many obstacles to higher productivity and wages from technological and structural changes.\" Vi\u00f1als said emerging markets from Turkey to Indonesia could struggle in the face of rising interest rates, weakening corporate earnings, and depreciating exchange rates. \"Indeed, in this scenario, emerging market corporates owing almost 35% of outstanding debt could find it hard to service their obligations. While the situation varies widely across countries, those economies under recent pressure also share some vulnerabilities in their corporate sectors,\" he said. To solve issues that reveal the inter-connectedness of national economies, he said: \"We need greater global policy cooperation as we are all in this together. This extends to monetary policy, financial regulation and supervision, and ensuring orderly market conditions.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's trade deficit narrowed in February as imports fell more sharply than exports, but signs of the government's desired economic rebalancing remained elusive. Exports fell by 1.6% on the previous month to \u00a323.5bn, the lowest level in more than three years, while imports fell by a sharper 2.2% to \u00a332.6bn. That left a goods deficit of \u00a39.1bn in February, smaller than January's \u00a39.5bn deficit and slightly smaller than the \u00a39.3bn predicted by the City. The overall trade deficit fell to \u00a32.1bn in February, down from \u00a32.2bn in January. Despite a shrinking deficit, economists said the figures suggested trade would be a negative drag on the economy in the first quarter. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, said: \"Fundamentally, the UK is running a trade deficit because we do not make enough things that other countries want to buy \u2013 perhaps as a result of the many years of an overvalued exchange rate before the crisis. And also because the authorities are stimulating a stronger domestic recovery than our main trading partner, the euro-area. That is unlikely to be a recipe for a dramatic rebalancing of the UK.\" The government is hoping to rebalance the UK economy towards a greater reliance on manufacturing and exports, away from spending and financial services. George Osborne set a target in 2012 of doubling UK exports to \u00a31tn by 2020, and announced measures in last month's budget aimed at helping to achieve that goal. However, trade is not expected to be a driver of UK growth over the next five years according to the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. The trade picture in February worsened when the impact of erratic goods such as aircraft \u2013 accounting for a large proportion of the fall in imports \u2013 was stripped out. Imports were down by just 0.6% on that basis, a smaller drop than the fall in exports. The fall in UK exports was most pronounced in goods shipped to countries within the European Union, Britain's biggest trading partner, down by \u00a3300m to \u00a311.7bn. In more positive news for the government, exports outside the EU performed slightly better, down by less than \u00a3100m to \u00a311.9bn. UK exports have been hit by weak demand from the eurozone during the financial crisis, and policymakers believe that increased trade with fast growing emerging markets will be key if the long term rebalancing of the economy is to be achieved. The ONS said that a better understanding of Britain's trade position could be gleaned from quarterly rather than monthly data. Again the goods deficit narrowed by \u00a33bn to \u00a326.2bn in the three months to February compared with the previous three months, as imports fell more sharply than exports. The broader trade in goods and services deficit also narrowed modestly, to \u00a32.1bn in February from \u00a32.2bn in January. Data from the UK manufacturing sector on Tuesday showed a much stronger than expected increase in output in February, providing some hope that exports of British goods might start to pick up. \"Strong manufacturing growth and a recently improving trade balance hold out some hope that the UK economy will not suffer too much of a drag from net trade this year and next,\" Wood said.",
