      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy will grind to a near standstill over the coming months as post-referendum uncertainty triggers a slump in business investment, a leading business group has warned as it slashed its growth forecasts. In its first set of forecasts since the vote to leave the EU, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) on Monday more than halved its GDP growth prediction for next year from 2.3% to 1.0%. That would mark the worst economic performance since 2009, when the UK was emerging from a deep recession sparked by the global financial crisis. Recent economic indicators suggest activity has rebounded from an initial post-referendum dive but the BCC\u2019s gloomy outlook shows that businesses remain nervous about the prospect of protracted negotiations to leave the EU and about potential trade deals. The confidence of the business community was dealt another blow over the weekend as it emerged Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, had launched an extraordinary attack on British executives, suggesting they would rather play golf than export their goods and services. Asked about Fox\u2019s description of a Britain that had grown \u201ctoo lazy and too fat\u201d on earlier successes, BCC president Francis Martin called for politicians to support businesses as the country works out its EU exit. \u201cBusiness and government need to work together if we\u2019re to make a success of the transition ahead,\u201d said Martin. \u201cBusiness people don\u2019t mind a robust conversation, but they will insist on a constructive one.\u201d The business group\u2019s new forecasts put it broadly in line with the Bank of England, which also sees a sharp slowdown in GDP growth next year to just 0.8% from 2% this year. The Bank has already cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% and expanded its programme to pump electronic cash into the economy. It is widely expected to cut base rates again, to 0.1%, before the end of the year. But no move is anticipated when its policymakers meet this week, according to a Reuters poll of economists. The BCC is cautioning against reading too much into recent signs of a bounceback in output for manufacturers and services firms, a pick-up in exports and a steadying in construction work. \u201cAlthough individual businesses continue to report strong trading conditions, the overall picture suggests a sharp slowdown in UK growth lies ahead,\u201d said Adam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s acting director general. \u201cOur forecast suggests that the UK is likely to avoid a recession, but with the health warning that businesses are still digesting the result of June\u2019s EU referendum and the challenges and opportunities to come.\u201d The group, which represents a network of 52 chambers around the UK, believes the economy will eke out quarterly growth of just 0.1% in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter. That compares with 0.6% in the second quarter of April to June. For 2016 as a whole the BCC has downgraded its growth forecast from 2.2% to 1.8%. After growth of 1.0% in 2017, it sees the economy gaining some momentum to grow 1.8% in 2018 \u2013 compared with an earlier forecast for 2.4%. Marshall said a number of uncertainties were weighing on sentiment. \u201cThe value of sterling, the shape of future trade relationships, the status of EU nationals in the UK workforce and other factors will all influence business confidence over the coming quarters,\u201d he said. A large fall in investment, along with weaker consumer spending, was the main reason for the weaker outlook. Business investment is expected to fall by 2.2% in 2016 and by 3.4% in 2017. That compares with previous forecasts for 4.5% growth in 2016 and a 7.4% rise in 2017. The group predicts some help to the UK\u2019s trading position from a weaker pound, which tumbled against other currencies following the referendum result, making UK goods cheaper in overseas markets. Businesses are looking ahead to Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement on 23 November when the chancellor will set out how the government will use tax and spending plans to help the economy weather the post-referendum turmoil. Marshall said businesses were relying on ministers to support business investment and confidence. \u201cThey should start with the long list of business-boosting infrastructure projects that have been put on hold for far too long \u2013 including a firm decision on a new airport runway, new nuclear investment, and road and rail schemes,\u201d he said. Hopes of more clarity on one such project, the HS2 high-speed rail link, were dented at the weekend as its boss, Simon Kirby, announced he was leaving to join Rolls-Royce. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, is expected to make a key decision on the project\u2019s future in the coming weeks. But business groups have been encouraged by Theresa May\u2019s apparent commitment to reviving investment, innovation and exports with an industrial strategy. For now most economists \u2013 the BCC\u2019s forecasters included \u2013 expect the services sector and consumer spending to remain the main driver of UK growth. Signs of spending holding up well have been one of the main factors behind City analysts toning down their earlier forecasts for a post-referendum slump. But fresh figures on Monday will serve as a reminder that households are still coming to terms with the Brexit vote and its implications. Consumer spending flatlined in August, rising just 0.1% on the year after growth of 1.6% in July, said Visa. The credit card company\u2019s monthly consumer spending index, compiled by Markit, showed the effects of the weaker pound, which makes Britons\u2019 overseas holidays more expensive. Kevin Jenkins, the UK and Ireland managing director at Visa, said: \u201cIn line with reports that people opted for UK \u2018staycations\u2019 over last-minute overseas trips in August, leisure and recreation remained the strongest performers, with transport and communications \u2013 the category that captures flight bookings - experiencing a significant fall.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The music industry has issued a plea to politicians to protect the UK\u2019s status as one of the world\u2019s biggest exporters of new music during negotiations to leave the EU. New figures show UK music enjoyed another strong year for exports in 2015, prompting the industry\u2019s main trade group to warn that politicians must recognise both its contribution to the economy and its power to raise Britain\u2019s profile around the world thanks to the popularity of artists such as Adele and Sam Smith. There was a surge in foreign sales of British music and in ticket sales to overseas residents for events in Britain in 2015, according to the umbrella group UK Music, which represents the commercial music industry, including artists, songwriters and record labels. That drove a 3.4% rise in exports to \u00a32.2bn in 2015 and left exports up 11% since 2012, when UK Music began compiling figures. That reflected another year of international chart success for British artists. Five of the top 10 artists in the world last year in terms of sales were from the UK \u2013 Adele, Ed Sheeran, One Direction, Coldplay and Sam Smith. UK Music\u2019s chief executive, Jo Dipple, said the industry was outperforming the wider UK economy and was punching above its weight around the world, with artists such as Skepta outselling US acts in North America. But she sounded a note of caution over its post-referendum prospects and said the industry wanted to see policies that would maintain its export power. \u201cThe UK needs to solidify its new post-Brexit place in the world and music will undoubtedly be part of the glue that does this. Our export profile is astounding which is partly why music, like sport, gives the world an understanding of our small country,\u201d said Dipple. \u201cUK Music\u2019s goal is to work with government to convince them to give us policies as good as the music we produce.\u201d The export success helped lift the industry\u2019s contribution to the UK economy to \u00a34.1bn last year. That was an improvement of just 0.6% on the year before but was up 17% on 2012. Employment in the music industry rose 1.4% on the year with 119,020 full time jobs in 2015. That was a rise of 11% since 2012, the Measuring Music report said. In a statement to accompany the report, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, emphasised the UK music industry\u2019s international success. \u201cThe extraordinary success of artists like Coldplay and Adele added billions to our economy. We want to maintain and build on that success. The government is working closely with industry bodies, such as UK Music, to make it easier for these artists to do business and is investing in music education to nurture the next wave of successful British artists, who we want to see perform across the whole world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the value of music goes beyond the economic. People around the world get their first taste of British culture via our music, while for millions at home it is a source of entertainment and creative expression.\u201d The annual health check of the industry showed that while overall employment and output were up, there were still some areas struggling as the music industry continued to adapt to fast-changing consumer habits and technology. As CD sales dropped 3.9% in 2015, recorded music suffered a 1% fall in what UK Music terms its \u201ccontribution to the economy\u201d, or gross value added (GVA). On 2012, recorded music\u2019s GVA was down 4%. But the trade group said the physical market remained resilient and it highlighted an ongoing resurgence in vinyl records where sales were up 60% in each of the past three years. \u201cAll in all, there is every sign that the recorded sector will return to growth in 2016,\u201d said the UK Music chairman, Andy Heath. As trends change from owning music to streaming it with services such as Spotify or YouTube, the UK music industry has called for fair remuneration for artists and rights holders and it renewed that plea in Monday\u2019s report. Paid subscription streaming services such as Apple Music, Spotify and Tidal have provided a significant boost to the digital music economy and their value jumped from \u00a3168m in 2014 to \u00a3251m in 2015, the report said. But it accused other advertising-funded digital services of devaluing music. \u201cThe YouTube model, despite its reach, is yet to deliver fair financial returns for rights owners and creators, artists, composers, songwriters and publishers,\u201d the report said. It also called for more support for grassroots music venues after a drop in concert revenues last year. It meant that while a total audience of 27.7 million attended music events in the UK in 2015, there was a slight dip in live music\u2019s overall contribution to the economy. \u201cGrassroots music venues need investment now,\u201d said Dipple.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell has started production at the world\u2019s deepest underwater oil and gas field, 1.8 miles beneath the sea surface in the Gulf of Mexico. The first oil pumped from the Stones field, 200 miles south of New Orleans, comes after billions of dollars of investment from Shell over the last three years. The achievement will anger many climate change campaigners, but will boost annual pay for Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, under the group\u2019s controversial performance bonus arrangements. The field is in much deeper water than the Macondo prospect, where six years ago BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank, killing 11 workers and causing environmental disaster. The latest costly addition to Shell\u2019s production capacity comes despite Van Beurden\u2019s repeated pledges on climate change. In May, he said: \u201cWe know our long-term success \u2026 depends on our ability to anticipate the types of energy that people will need in the future in a way that is both commercially competitive and environmentally sound.\u201d Faced with low oil prices and increased pressure from climate change activists, Shell has retreated from some of its most expensive production projects. In the autumn last year, it ditched drilling operations in the Alaskan Artic and abandoned a tar sands project in Alberta, Canada. But the group has told shareholders it will continue spending heavily on pioneering deep water projects, which will provide a major source of future growth. Announcing production had begun at Stones, Shell said: \u201cOur growing expertise in using such technologies in innovative ways will help us unlock more deep water resources around the world.\u201d Shell has forecast that its deep water production will increase to the equivalent of more than 900,000 barrels of oil a day by the early 2020s from already discovered, established reservoirs. Major projects the group is working on include Coulomb Phase 2 and Appomattox in the Gulf of Mexico and Malikai off the coast of Malaysia. Shell began the costly Stones project in 2013, two years after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that two-thirds of proven fossil fuel reserves will need to remain in the ground to prevent the earth from warming 2C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 a proposed temperature limit beyond which scientists warn of spiralling and irreversible climate change. At Stones, oil and gas is pumped from several points on the sea bed through flexible riser pipes to a specialised tanker, incorporating a detachable 3,150-tonne buoy. In the event of a hurricane, Shell says the tanker can halt production and sail away safely from the buoy and riser pipes. Stones will produce the equivalent of about 50,000 barrels of oil a day when ramped up to full capacity at the end of 2017. Van Beurden\u2019s annual bonus depends, in part, on delivering major new projects on time and on budget. For 2015, he received a bonus of \u20ac3.5m, which formed part of an overall pay and pension package worth \u20ac5.58m. Van Beurden has repeatedly insisted he is determined that Shell should play a part in helping the world take action to end global warming. At Shell\u2019s annual shareholder meeting last year, the board promised a group of activist shareholders, including the Church of England, to better explain how bonus schemes for Van Beurden and others were aligned with its professed ambitions to help tackle climate change. At this year\u2019s meeting, however, activist investors said \u201cclarification is urgently required\u201d on this point. Shell has stressed that 10% of Van Beurden\u2019s bonus is tied to the group\u2019s \u201csustainability\u201d performance. However, these incentives target how much energy the group uses, the volume of oil spilt and water usage. They do not focus on what campaigners see as the core concern: how Shell plans to manage its way to a low-carbon global economy. Meanwhile, 20% of the Van Beurden\u2019s bonus is still tied to delivering major new production projects, such as Stones. A further 30% is linked to the group\u2019s ability to generate cash, while 12% of the bonus depends on production volumes.",

      "bodyText": "Formula One insiders are used to twists and turns but this week even they were caught by surprise with the news that control of the sport\u2019s parent company is expected to change hands for the first time in a decade in a $4.4bn (\u00a33.3bn) deal. Talk of a sale had been revving up for so long that some thought it would never happen but that all changed on Wednesday night when the American conglomerate Liberty Media announced a takeover of F1\u2019s Jersey-based parent company, Delta Topco. Bernie Ecclestone has been the driving force behind the sport for the past four decades and F1\u2019s 85-year\u2011old chief executive will remain in the driving seat for at least the next three years. It gives the sport continuity as Liberty brings great change. The glamorous F1 global circus is based in London and has failed to float several times. By contrast, Liberty\u2019s headquarters are in the sleepy town of Englewood, Colorado. The cable TV and media giant is listed on Nasdaq and majority owned by the billionaire John Malone, nicknamed Darth Vader for his ruthless deal-making style. In the year to 31 December 2015 Liberty made a $248m net profit from revenues of $4.8bn. Its big-name sports credentials have to date been limited to the Eurosport TV channel and the Atlanta Braves baseball team. The firm is not well-known in Europe but it is a power player in the entertainment world. Liberty holds a 34% stake in the event promoter Live Nation, which in turn owns Ticketmaster. The sister company Liberty Global, which is also majority owned by Malone, owns Virgin Media plus the TV production company behind Midsomer Murders and The Only Way is Essex, and 10% of ITV. It also has a stake in the Formula E electric racing series alongside Discovery Communications. Malone owns 29% of the voting rights in Discovery, which is the parent group of Eurosport. F1 is one of Liberty\u2019s biggest single investments and, provided that the deal gets regulatory clearance it will end up with a 35.3% stake, with Malone personally holding 3.1%. Another 1% will be in the hands of Liberty\u2019s chief executive, Greg Maffei, and 24.7% retained by the previous controlling owner, the private equity firm CVC. The purchase is being fuelled with more than $1bn of cash together with payment in Liberty shares and $351m of debt. Liberty is also taking on F1\u2019s existing $4.1bn in bank debt \u2013 meaning Delta Topco has an overall enterprise value of $8bn. It is high-octane and there is good reason for that. F1 has three core revenue streams. Starting at the bottom, in the year to the end of December 2015 $250m came from selling trackside advertising at each of the 19 races and sponsorship of the series. F1\u2019s partners include the parcel delivery service DHL and Heineken, which signed up in June, and will be handing over an estimated $40m annually. There are two other major sources of F1\u2019s revenue \u2013 fees from circuits that host races and broadcasting rights. They each bring in roughly the same amount and last year it came to a combined $1.2bn. Along with $339.4m from other sources this gave Delta Topco total revenue of $1.7bn in 2015 \u2013 with underlying profits of $464m. In the decade that CVC has held the keys F1 has made total net profits of $3.5bn and it has a well-oiled formula. F1 doesn\u2019t own any tracks or teams so costs are kept under tight control. The company only has 356 staff and its biggest single cost is a payment of 63% of its gross profits to the teams as prize money. Over the five years to 2015 the prize money payment shot up nearly 30% to just over $900m due to the boom in interest in F1. It is a staggering sum but it isn\u2019t the only trick under F1\u2019s bonnet. Ecclestone has promoted F1 to emerging markets, such as Singapore and Bahrain, which view the races as away to boost their global status or drive tourism through the sport\u2019s 400m TV viewers. The limited number of slots on the F1 calendar has fuelled an arms race in the amount countries are prepared to spend to get a race with the highest hosting fees rising to nearly $80m annually. To insulate against inflation, the key contracts contain an escalator clause which increases the amount paid by 10% annually. Only 10% to 20% of them need to be renewed annually as they have an average length of around five years. It gives F1 contracted revenue of $9.3bn up to 2026 which makes it very different to other sports because its financial performance is not related to the events on track. And CVC has been the biggest winner. Since it invested in F1 in 2006 CVC has extracted $4.4bn from dividends and the sale of stakes in Delta Topco. Pro rata, CVC\u2019s 38.1% stake will give it $1.7bn in cash and shares in Liberty bringing its total haul to $6.1bn \u2013 that is a 532% return on the $965.6m that CVC invested in 2006 putting F1 in pole position to be its most profitable investment. In contrast, CVC made a 314% return from its investment in gaming firm William Hill and 292% from stockbroker Collins Stewart. Although its biggest return is believed to be the 831% it got from the 2005 sale of a Spanish hospital business \u2013 but that only returned \u20ac222m in cash. CVC can\u2019t afford to take its hands off the wheel just yet though as the sale to Liberty is still far from the finish line. Perhaps the biggest hurdle is that the FIA has a 1% stake in Delta Topco which CVC granted it in 2013. The FIA paid just over $458,000 for the stake which is now worth $44m and, according to the share transfer agreement, it can only be cashed in when CVC sells its shares. In order for the sale to proceed consent is needed from the FIA and the European Commission. The FIA has to decide whether Liberty is a \u2018fit and proper\u2019 owner of F1 but the EC may consider it to be conflicted due to its financial interest in the sale. Like any good F1 race a last-minute twist could still be on the cards.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cAn ordinary day ended as the biggest manmade ecological disaster in history,\u201d says one of the taglines. Trailers for the new disaster movie Deepwater Horizon, based on the April 2010 disaster, which will be released later this month, quickly shift from sickly sweet family scenes of Mark Wahlberg bidding farewell to his wife and daughter as he goes off to work on a huge oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to a desperate fight for survival, as panicked workers scramble to escape the burning oil rig. The Hollywood marketeers are right with their tagline. It was a global disaster with far-reaching human and environmental consequences. Eleven people were killed and about 4.9m barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf in the worst spill in US history. The story of Deepwater Horizon is also \u201ctragedy on an epic scale\u201d for BP, which operated the rig, according to the US corporate governance expert Lynn Stout. The oil company was later found to have been grossly negligent in its handling of the well and has faced billions of dollars in penalties. Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell Law School, chose the story of how profit-driven decisions at BP led to disaster to open her 2012 book The Shareholder Value Myth. In her view, there are wider lessons to learn from BP\u2019s tale about how costcutting and skimping on safety procedures to secure short-term shareholder gains ended up costing investors in the long run. The Deepwater Horizon disaster is one example of a problem that afflicts many companies, she says. That problem is the idea that the company belongs to its shareholders and exists for one purpose only: to maximise wealth for those shareholders. Six years on from the deadly blowout, you do not have to look far for more examples of companies misbehaving and cutting corners, which subsequently hurts shareholders. Last week, Sports Direct faced anger from shareholders after the company accepted that it had not treated employees properly. The admission followed months of pressure on the retailer\u2019s founder, Mike Ashley, and Sports Direct after the Guardian highlighted a climate of fear at the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire. As the revelations about the company began to batter its reputation, the share price fell and previously quiet stockholders emerged to voice their disquiet. Everyone loses here. The workers, the shareholders and business at large. Many companies, particularly smaller ones, will tell you they exist for their employees and customers, as much as for shareholder gains. Yet those who want to serve a wider base of stakeholders may find themselves hamstrung by a legal system that appears to put shareholder interests centre stage. For all their willingness to do good, is it not the primary duty of company directors to create value for shareholders? There does not appear to be a straightforward answer. Lawyers will disagree over how company directors should interpret the 2006 Companies Act, which states in section 172 (pdf) that \u201ca director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members\u201d. But for Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, there is no question that this statement makes shareholder primacy explicit. As he put it in a speech exploring company ownership last year: \u201cFor the first time in history, shareholder primacy had been hardwired into companies\u2019 statutory purposes.\u201d This idea of shareholder primacy is seen in the way that a company\u2019s share price performance has increasingly become the key measure of success. As in Stout\u2019s Deepwater Horizon example, the pitfalls of this are obvious. When chief executives manage the share price rather than the company itself, short-termism can quickly take over. Investment suffers as shareholders hungry for dividends demand ever increasing payouts, while risk taking rises, as demonstrated to disastrous global effect by the financial crisis. When the shareholder is king, a company\u2019s long-term success and impact on those around it take a back seat. But campaigners for a different kind of capitalism say it does not have to be this way. A growing movement is putting forward a new model, where directors answer to a range of stakeholders, such as employees and the environment, not just investors. Those pushing for change may dare to hope their calls will be answered now that Theresa May is vowing tackle corporate irresponsibility and \u201creform capitalism so that it works for everyone not just the privileged few\u201d. The good news for the prime minister is that a simple amendment to company law could make a big difference. The charity B Lab UK is urging the government to pass \u201cbenefit company\u201d legislation. The reform would give companies the option to reject shareholder primacy and be managed for the benefit of all stakeholders, according to the charity, which represents a growing number of so-called B Corps, or benefit corporations. This model has three mandatory elements: a broadened purpose, director accountability and stakeholder transparency. The movement behind benefit corporations started a decade ago in the US to pioneer the idea that companies are \u201cbest for the world\u201d, rather than best in the world. The movement has spread to include 1,800 B Corps in 50 countries. In some places, laws have been changed for companies to turn themselves into B Corps, but in others, no such change has been deemed necessary. Some corporate governance experts argue that the UK is one such case and the law already allows for a wide range of stakeholders to be considered by company chiefs. At the moment, when a UK company becomes a B Corp, it changes its constitution. However, B Lab UK says a small amendment to the law would clear things up. As the charity\u2019s co-founder James Perry says, for directors worried about where their legal duties lie, a law \u201cgives you a fighting chance, or a platform\u201d to act in the interests of society and the environment. Perry, who helped set up the frozen ready meals retailer Cook, insists that the change would still leave companies with the option to continue putting shareholders first. But ultimately, the market will decide, he says. Those who choose the broader stakeholder model may find that it makes more business sense. The hope is that a sense of purpose raises longer-run success, helps recruit and retain skilled staff, and appeals to customers. The B Corps movement in the UK likes to say it is to business what Fairtrade certification is to coffee. If the new government is serious about shaking up capitalism, this is an easy win. Companies\u2019 corporate and social responsibility programmes can do good, but they do not address the root causes of corporate misbehaviour, misjudgments or recklessness. For that, we must move beyond a world where shareholders reign supreme.",

The admission followed months of pressure on the retailer\u2019s founder, Mike Ashley, and Sports Direct after the Guardian highlighted <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">a climate of fear </a>at the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire. As the revelations about the company began to batter its reputation, the share price fell and previously quiet stockholders emerged to voice their disquiet.</p> <p>Everyone loses here. The workers, the shareholders and business at large.<br></p> <p>Many companies, particularly smaller ones, will tell you they exist for their employees and customers, as much as for shareholder gains. Yet those who want to serve a wider base of stakeholders may find themselves hamstrung by a legal system that appears to put shareholder interests centre stage. For all their willingness to do good, is it not the primary duty of company directors to create value for shareholders?</p> <p>There does not appear to be a straightforward answer. Lawyers will disagree over how company directors should interpret the 2006 Companies Act, which <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/pdfs/ukpga_20060046_en.pdf\">states in section 172</a> (pdf) that \u201ca director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members\u201d. But for Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, there is no question that this statement makes shareholder primacy explicit. As he put it in a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/833.aspx\">speech exploring company ownership</a> last year: \u201cFor the first time in history, shareholder primacy had been hardwired into companies\u2019 statutory purposes.\u201d</p> <p>This idea of shareholder primacy is seen in the way that a company\u2019s share price performance has increasingly become the key measure of success.</p> <p>As in Stout\u2019s Deepwater Horizon example, the pitfalls of this are obvious. When chief executives manage the share price rather than the company itself, short-termism can quickly take over. Investment suffers as shareholders hungry for dividends demand ever increasing payouts, while risk taking rises, as demonstrated to disastrous global effect by the financial crisis.</p> <p>When the shareholder is king, a company\u2019s long-term success and impact on those around it take a back seat.</p> <p>But campaigners for a different kind of capitalism say it does not have to be this way. A growing movement is putting forward a new model, where directors answer to a range of stakeholders, such as employees and the environment, not just investors. Those pushing for change may dare to hope their calls will be answered now that Theresa May is vowing tackle corporate irresponsibility and \u201creform capitalism so that it works for everyone not just the privileged few\u201d.</p> <p>The good news for the prime minister is that a simple amendment to company law could make a big difference. </p> <p>The charity <a href=\"http://bcorporation.uk/meet-b-lab-uk\">B Lab UK</a> is urging the government to pass \u201cbenefit company\u201d legislation. The reform would give companies the option to reject shareholder primacy and be managed for the benefit of all stakeholders, according to the charity, which represents a growing number of so-called B Corps, or benefit corporations. This model has three mandatory elements: a broadened purpose, director accountability and stakeholder transparency.</p> <p>The movement behind benefit corporations <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/the-non-profit-behind-b-corps/our-history\">started a decade ago</a> in the US to pioneer the idea that companies are \u201cbest for the world\u201d, rather than best in the world. The movement has spread to include 1,800 B Corps in 50 countries.</p> <p>In some places, laws have been changed for companies to turn themselves into B Corps, but in others, no such change has been deemed necessary. Some corporate governance experts argue that the UK is one such case and the law already allows for a wide range of stakeholders to be considered by company chiefs. At the moment, when a UK company becomes a B Corp, it changes its constitution.</p> <p>However, B Lab UK says a small amendment to the law would clear things up. As the charity\u2019s co-founder James Perry says, for directors worried about where their legal duties lie, a law \u201cgives you a fighting chance, or a platform\u201d to act in the interests of society and the environment.</p> <p>Perry, who helped set up the frozen ready meals retailer Cook, insists that the change would still leave companies with the option to continue putting shareholders first. But ultimately, the market will decide, he says. Those who choose the broader stakeholder model may find that it makes more business sense. The hope is that a sense of purpose raises longer-run success, helps recruit and retain skilled staff, and appeals to customers. The B Corps movement in the UK likes to say it is to business what Fairtrade certification is to coffee.</p> <p>If the new government is serious about shaking up capitalism, this is an easy win. Companies\u2019 corporate and social responsibility programmes can do good, but they do not address the root causes of corporate misbehaviour, misjudgments or recklessness. For that, we must move beyond a world where shareholders reign supreme.</p>",

      "bodyText": "UK taxpayers subsidised cheap loans to a foreign metals company owned by a multibillionaire while the British steel industry was fighting for survival. Accounts for UK Export Finance (UKEF), which lends money to companies planning to buy products from British exporters, show that it gave \u00a382.8m in \u201cbuyer\u2019s credit\u201d to Lebedinsky GOK, which mines iron ore, a key element in steel production. Lebedinsky is part of the metals and mining company Metalloinvest, which is owned by the Uzbek-born tycoon Alisher Usmanov, who has a stake in Arsenal. UKEF\u2019s support for Lebedinsky helped finance a contract with Midrex UK, a subsidiary of the US company Midrex Technologies, which is owned by Japan\u2019s Kobe Steel. Accounts for Midrex UK show that it employed six staff and paid no corporation tax in Britain. Midrex Technologies says it set up a UK office to take advantage of the taxpayer-backed UKEF scheme. The company\u2019s website says Midrex UK was \u201cspecifically established in the heart of one of the world\u2019s financial hubs to provide our customers with access to valuable project financing\u201d. Gareth Stace, the director of UK Steel, said: \u201cThe UK steel sector has been in the deepest crisis for more than a generation in the past 12 months for two key reasons: higher costs resulting from punitive government policy and the massive rise in dumping of steel from countries such as Russia. \u201cLearning that government money is being pumped directly into the Russian steel sector beggars belief and actively goes against everything we have been calling on the UK government to do, to ensure that the UK steel sector can compete on a fair and level playing field.\u201d The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes the Port Talbot steelworks, the future of which has been under threat, called on the business secretary, Greg Clark, to investigate the loans immediately. \u201cIf it is true that UKEF has been underwriting loans for steel projects that deliver relatively little tangible benefit to the British economy, and which are actively supporting the foreign steel industry, then a number of questions will have to be answered by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy,\u201d Kinnock said. \u201cThe British steel industry has been battling for survival for some time now and so it beggars belief that British taxpayers have been underwriting loans that are supporting the activities of foreign companies that are operating in direct competition with our very own steel industry. \u201cBritish steelworkers make the best steel that money can buy. They are not looking for special treatment, but they are looking for a government that is going to fight their corner \u2013 a government that is doing all it possibly can to support and strengthen this vital foundation industry. Instead, they have a government that has demonstrated nothing but incompetence and indifference. \u201cI urge the new secretary of state to conduct an urgent, comprehensive and detailed inquiry into this case.\u201d A spokesman for Midrex said while Midrex UK was set up \u201cpartly at least\u201d to take advantage of UKEF, British companies had benefited from its use of buyers\u2019 credit. \u201cUnder our contract, Midrex UK placed a number of subcontracts with various UK companies to supply equipment, goods and services as required under our main contract with Lebedinsky GOK,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThese subcontracts ran to tens of millions of dollars of work that was placed in the UK, which, in the absence of UKEF support, may not have all been won by the UK.\u201d UKEF said: \u201cUK Export Finance\u2019s mission is to ensure that no viable UK export fails for lack of finance or insurance, supporting UK economic growth and employment. \u201cWe support UK businesses and do not discriminate against those with non-UK parent companies. Midrex UK is a UK company, and with our support, [it] sourced goods from UK suppliers in the Midlands for this transaction, supporting the UK manufacturing industry and jobs in the sector.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Across Europe, with growing numbers of baby boomers clinging to their office chairs, it has become harder for unskilled and semi-skilled young people to find work. Even graduates struggle to find work commensurate with their expertise. \u201cEurope needs an immediate answer on growth, youth and security issues,\u201d said Sandro Gozi, Italian secretary of state for European affairs at a meeting of European leaders in Italy last month. Most European leaders have wrung their hands and expressed their sympathy for the young as first the financial crash and then a succession of crises sent unemployment rates for 15- to 24-year-olds soaring. Earlier this year, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande described France\u2019s unemployment rate as an \u201ceconomic and social emergency\u201d. Announcing a \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.7bn) jobs package, the French president said he was particularly upset at a youth unemployment rate that had topped 24%. His answer was deeply traditional \u2013 before the end of the year he intended to put 500,000 unemployed into vocational training programmes, in addition to the 150,000 announced last October. To tackle youth unemployment more specifically, 150,000 would be enrolled in civic service volunteer programmes, almost three times as many as the 60,000 youngsters enrolled in 2015. State-run training programmes are nothing new in France and are often used to fill a jobs void. The suspicion must be that when the July youth unemployment figures for the eurozone showed a drop of 136,000, and France\u2019s unemployment rate fell below 10% for the first time in his presidency, the falls could be largely attributed to Hollande\u2019s civic service scheme, rather than a resurgent private sector. Germany\u2019s, and France\u2019s, answer has been to devise work schemes and skills centres that aim to make the young ready for work at least by the time they are 30. And the use of internships, short-term and flexible contracts is equally rife. Like companies in the UK, German firms look around for ways to cut costs to afford the hugely expensive benefits negotiated by older, often unionised, workers. Invariably, they turn to the young for savings. The scale of this attack on the terms and conditions of young workers in France and Germany pales compared to the brutal exploitation of under-25s in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. These countries have always assumed young people will live at home while they are educated and trained for the workplace. Eight years after the financial crisis, this situation can only be described as extreme. In Italy, around 80% of under-30s live in their parental home and the average age for achieving \u201ceconomic independence\u201d is estimated at 35. Thousands still leave for Germany and Britain and those who stay must work with few benefits and little job security. Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi spent his first months in office overturning rules that restricted firms from hiring and firing, making the jobs market even more flexible and insecure. This policy, tax cuts and the end of a long recession last year has brought Italy\u2019s youth unemployment rate down from 43% in 2014 to 39.2% in July 2016. It is also worth noting that, as with the other Mediterranean countries, the official figures fail to reveal a huge hidden economy that offers work cash-in-hand to young people. These tax-free payments keep their heads financially above water from week to week, but don\u2019t allow them to purchase a home, start a family or save for a pension. Renzi wants Brussels to sanction a huge investment drive across Europe, in the wake of Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, to encourage private companies to train young workers. It\u2019s easy to see why, when the Italian economy is weighed down by troubled banks and the finance ministry is out of funds. But getting agreement from the rest of Europe, and Germany in particular, will be difficult. In the meantime, the continent\u2019s youth will experience differing fortunes.",

These countries have always assumed young people will live at home while they are educated and trained for the workplace. Eight years after the financial crisis, this situation can only be described as extreme.</p> <p>In Italy, around 80% of under-30s live in their parental home and the average age for achieving \u201ceconomic independence\u201d is estimated at 35. Thousands still leave for Germany and Britain and those who stay must work with few benefits and little job security.</p> <p>Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi spent his first months in office overturning rules that restricted firms from hiring and firing, making the jobs market even more flexible and insecure. This policy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/italian-pm-matteo-renzi-electoral-reform-law-italy\" title=\"\">tax cuts</a> and the end of a long recession last year has brought Italy\u2019s youth unemployment rate down from 43% in 2014 to 39.2% in July 2016.</p> <p>It is also worth noting that, as with the other Mediterranean countries, the official figures fail to reveal a huge hidden economy that offers work cash-in-hand to young people. These tax-free payments keep their heads financially above water from week to week, but don\u2019t allow them to purchase a home, start a family or save for a pension.</p> <p>Renzi wants Brussels to sanction a huge investment drive across Europe, in the wake of Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, to encourage private companies to train young workers. It\u2019s easy to see why, when the Italian economy is weighed down by troubled banks and the finance ministry is out of funds. But getting agreement from the rest of Europe, and Germany in particular, will be difficult. In the meantime, the continent\u2019s youth will experience differing fortunes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the founder of Sports Direct and owner of Newcastle United, Mike Ashley will be used to sporting idioms, and here is one for him to ponder over the weekend: so near yet so far. That is the critics\u2019 reaction to Sports Direct after its public open day this week. Ashley has launched a series of initiatives to try to improve working conditions and corporate governance at Sports Direct, such as offering shop staff on zero-hours contracts the option of guaranteed hours. But major flaws at the company remain and when the mask slipped during Sports Direct\u2019s PR assault at the open day, Ashley showed that the fundamental problem has not changed \u2013 he has too much power. Ashley lost his cool in the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting and tried to blame trade union Unite for the working conditions in Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse. He also expressed his frustration at press coverage of the company and participated in cringeworthy joint television interviews with Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, turning to the former policeman for his agreement about a point he had just made to say: \u201cKeith, yes?\u201d. Hellawell responded with a meek \u201cI agree\u201d. Hellawell\u2019s position at Sports Direct is at the centre of the problem. He should leave the company immediately. It is unprecedented for a FTSE company to have more than half its independent shareholders vote against the re-election of the chairman. Hellawell, we are told, tried to resign before the vote but was talked out of it by the rest of the board. This simply reinforces the perception that he does not have the power or the will to challenge Ashley, who still owns 55% of Sports Direct. The chairman is supposed to be head of the board. No one should be telling him what to do. The charge sheet against Hellawell is emphatic. His failures include: the lack of a permanent finance director for more than two years; carrying \u201cindependent\u201d non-executive directors who have been at the company so long they are no longer classified as independent according to the corporate governance code; and unorthodox related-party transactions with Ashley\u2019s brother, who manages international online delivery, and the boyfriend of Ashley\u2019s daughter, who manages Sport Direct\u2019s property strategy. Oh, and Sports Direct has also had to give back pay to staff who received less than the minimum wage, and its share price is trading at around a third of its peak. In this context, it is extraordinary that no heads have rolled among senior management and the board of Sports Direct. A fresh face as chairman or director could bring a new perspective to the company and at least show the world that Ashley is willing to take on new advice. As it is, Ashley has publicly asked that Sports Direct be given time to correct its shortcomings. But with Hellawell still in place, it is difficult to believe that the company will be revolutionised. The City institutions that have spoken out against Ashley, such as Standard Life and Legal &amp; General, rarely make such interventions and shy away from confrontations in public. The fact they aired their grievances in public \u2013 either through the media or the annual meeting \u2013 shows have they been unable to make progress behind closed doors. Sports Direct\u2019s shareholders must keep up the public pressure on Ashley. The tycoon has made welcome first steps in pledging to rethink zero-hours contracts and putting an employee representative on the board. But these are symptoms of a problem rather than a problem in themselves. The real problem is that no one at Sports Direct was ensuring that high standards of employment practice and corporate governance were maintained. That job should be the chairman\u2019s. A year ago it was unthinkable that Ashley would take the public and journalists on a tour of Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse. At previous AGMs Ashley would sit silently with his head in his hands before making a quick getaway by helicopter. So progress has been made \u2013 but, to use another sporting idiom, Sports Direct is still in the relegation zone. Serenity only lasts until the next forecast at the Bank Serenity is not usually a word associated with the Bank of England. Threadneedle Street is a place of unhurried calm, yes, but its staff are usually nervous about a possible recession or banking collapse for anyone to appear serene. Yet the bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said he was \u201cabsolutely serene\u201d about his warning of a possible recession after the EU referendum, even though that now seems unlikely, at least in the short term. Questioned by Brexit-supporting MPs, Carney also rejected the idea that he overreacted when it looked like his prophecy would come true following a slew of bad economic data in July. Look at the counterfactual, he said. Without the warnings, businesses and consumers might have found themselves sleepwalking off a cliff edge. And without an interest rate cut and an extension of the bank\u2019s stimulus package in the wake of the Brexit vote, a recession is exactly what we might be looking forward to. It was a performance to rank alongside his speeches earlier in the year. At each one he appeared more presidential \u2013 and, with the Treasury distracted, the only person who cared about Britain\u2019s economy. Brexit campaigner and Tory MP Steve Baker said as much when he thanked Carney for riding to the rescue while the cabinet imploded. This week the rate-setting committee Carney chairs will meet and no doubt agree that it has done a good job. It is expected to say that the rebound in August from the terrible July means they should wait and see before making another move. It\u2019s not until early November that the monetary policy committee will meet again and revise its long-term forecasts. And that brings us to Carney\u2019s achilles heel, which is the bank\u2019s predictions for growth, inflation and interest rates. Year-in, year-out, they have proved over-optimistic. At the beginning of the year, economists were ridiculing the bank as out of touch. If Carney misplaces his oracle and fails again to read the economic mood, his bravura performances this year could be for naught \u2013 and his serenity lost. Formula One is in dire neeed of a mechanical overhaul For those who think watching Formula One on television is a bore, news that the business that runs the sport is being sold for $8bn (\u00a36bn) would have been a shock. But it was probably also a shock for the team owners and track operators struggling to balance the books. Formula One Group looks like a consumer business that has been run too hot: think Tesco before its sales and profits slumped. It is making money for its owner but at the expensive of customers, who have become disillusioned with its offering. Eventually this has an impact on the financial performance, as it did for Tesco. TV viewing figures are stagnant, all but the biggest teams struggle to make a profit, and up-and-coming rivals, such as Formula E, are doing a better job of reaching out to a new generation of customers. Liberty Media, the new owner, has a lot of work to do.",

      "bodyText": "Former copper Keith Hellawell, the Clouseau-esque chairman of retailer Sports Direct, will wake up tomorrow with 51 weeks to save his job. That\u2019s 51 weeks more than most outside Sports Direct\u2019s boardroom reckon he deserves, but console yourselves with how much fun it\u2019s going to be watching him try. Independent shareholders finally voted for Hellawell to go last week, after a string of unnoticed working-practices scandals detonated right under the former chief constable\u2019s nose. Still, majority owner Mike Ashley supports Hellawell, so he can remain in post for now. He\u2019s promised to quit in a year if his bumbling continues. That was illustrated again last week when Hellawell admitted to ignoring evidence of poor practice because he\u2019d been fed nonsense by the firm. \u201cWe were acting on the information we had,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the biggest disappointments is we found that information was not correct.\u201d This is a man who was not only formerly one of our most senior policemen, but who also once reportedly turned down a chance to present BBC\u2019s Panorama (at \u00a310,000 a pop) because \u201che was not prepared to hold forth on subjects in which he had no expertise\u201d. That now looks more like a pricing issue. He gets \u00a3155,000 a year at Sports Direct \u2013 at least for another 51 weeks. Cash or plastic? Wait, they\u2019re both plastic now A new plastic \u00a35 note, featuring Sir Winston Churchill, will start appearing on the high street this week. The banknotes will enter circulation on Tuesday and will be printed on polymer \u2013 which is seen as cleaner, more secure and stronger. They will also feature Churchill\u2019s quote: \u201cI have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat\u201d \u2013 below the image of the wartime leader often thought to best depict his obdurate qualities. But does the portrait \u2013 originally taken by the photographer Yousuf Karsh \u2013 really show Churchill\u2019s bulldog spirit, or merely his legendary temper? Karsh took the photo in 1941 when Churchill visited the Canadian House of Commons. In a bold move during the shoot, the photographer snatched a cigar from Churchill\u2019s mouth. \u201cBy the time I got back to my camera,\u201d Karsh later recalled, \u201che looked so belligerent he could have devoured me.\u201d Bank governor Mark Carney puts it more smoothly: \u201cAs he himself said, \u2018a nation that forgets its past has no future\u2019. Our banknotes are repositories of the United Kingdom\u2019s collective memory and, like Churchill, our new polymer notes will stand the test of time.\u201d Ashley could do with a telecoms upgrade Back with Mike Ashley, the billionaire subjected himself to a mock search in Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse last week as part of his attempts to show how he\u2019s really just like his underpaid workforce. Memorably, the tycoon emptied his pockets of a huge wad of \u00a350 notes, as well as a rather ancient-looking mobile phone. Ashley\u2019s pal (and fellow saint of the high street) Sir Philip Green is also partial to using communications tools designed for a bygone age (vocabulary and hardware) \u2013 which, as a combination, starts to look like a good reason to ensure you\u2019ve got current kit. They\u2019ll be even more pressure along those lines this week when Apple starts selling its latest iPhone \u2013 the 12th iteration in its series, which is why it will be called iPhone 7. The new phone, which has a starting price of \u00a3599, will be water resistant and will come with all sorts of new features, such as no headphone socket \u2013 a thoughtful addition for that audience who like listening to music and films and feel they haven\u2019t quite spent enough on upgrading already. Ashley, of course, carries enough cash to modernise immediately, although form in his warehouse suggests he prefers more manual approaches.

In a bold move during the shoot, the photographer snatched a cigar from Churchill\u2019s mouth. \u201cBy the time I got back to my camera,\u201d Karsh later recalled, \u201che looked so belligerent he could have devoured me.\u201d</p> <p>Bank governor Mark Carney puts it more smoothly: \u201cAs he himself said, \u2018a nation that forgets its past has no future\u2019. Our banknotes are repositories of the United Kingdom\u2019s collective memory and, like Churchill, our new polymer notes will stand the test of&#xa0;time.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Ashley could do with a telecoms upgrade</strong></h2> <p>Back with Mike Ashley, the billionaire subjected himself to a mock search in Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse last week as part of his attempts to show how he\u2019s really just like his underpaid workforce. Memorably, the tycoon emptied his pockets of a huge wad of \u00a350 notes, as well as a rather ancient-looking mobile phone.</p> <p>Ashley\u2019s pal (and fellow saint of the high street) Sir Philip Green is also partial to using communications tools designed for a bygone age (vocabulary and hardware) \u2013 which, as a combination, starts to look like a good reason to ensure you\u2019ve got current kit.</p> <p>They\u2019ll be even more pressure along those lines this week when Apple starts selling its latest iPhone \u2013 the 12th iteration in its series, which is why it will be called iPhone 7.</p> <p>The new phone, which has a starting price of \u00a3599, will be water resistant and will come with all sorts of new features, such as no headphone socket \u2013 a thoughtful addition for that audience who like listening to music and films and feel they haven\u2019t quite spent enough on upgrading already.</p> <p>Ashley, of course, carries enough cash to modernise immediately, although form in his warehouse suggests he prefers more manual approaches. Calling up a lackey to do his internet searches, for example.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s conference delegates meet in Liverpool in a couple of weeks with a sense of ethical purity after officials banned McDonald\u2019s from buying a stand to advertise itself as a good employer. The national executive committee took the view that the burger chain\u2019s workers are among modern capitalism\u2019s losers and must be barred. Jeremy Corbyn was clear: the young, the low paid and the under-represented locked into insecure employment are getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop. And he\u2019s right. McDonald\u2019s workers are mainly young, are paid just above the minimum wage, lack union representation and are tied to zero-hours contracts. That ticks all four boxes. The trouble is that although McDonald\u2019s might not be the most generous employer, it does take 16- and 17-year-olds when many wouldn\u2019t, and promotes them quickly. They move through the ranks in such a way that almost all trainee managers can say they started behind the counter. And it pays the government\u2019s living wage of \u00a37.20 to 21-year-olds, when it could pay the minimum wage of \u00a36.70. Then there is the sad fact that most other companies operate without unions too. And many millennials don\u2019t appear to care, making the Labour leader\u2019s calls for greater union influence about as interesting to young people as the new Beatles film. It\u2019s clear that zero-hours contracts can rarely be justified. All employers should be forced to offer a minimum number of hours when even the billionaire Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, can promise to give shop staff a minimum of 12 hours\u2019 work a week. No one should be forced to wait on tenterhooks to find out what hours the company rota has them working over the next week or month. And there\u2019s worse: the 160,000 workers in the care industry, many of them nurses, are effectively subsidising the public purse when they drive from one patient to the next; they are only paid for the time they actually spend with clients. But for all their flaws, the contracts have their supporters, as shown by a survey last year that found workers using zero-hours contracts to be at least as happy as those on full-time arrangements. Some of these contented workers might even be in Liverpool, working for the security firm Labour has employed for the conference: Crawley-based OCS uses zero-hours contracts, though, it argues, only for one-off events. The same problem applies to any discussion of young people in relation to housing. The young are not a class or a homogenous group, defeating the simplistic Corbynite view of the world. Right-to-buy is a classic example. Tens of thousands of people in the lowest socioeconomic groups have cashed in on a 30-year property boom. Even though house prices have soared, their gain might be relatively modest. But they have a stake: and their home could easily be worth more than the \u00a3325,000 inheritance tax threshold. That\u2019s why George Osborne promised to raise the threshold on a couple\u2019s wealth to \u00a31m by the end of the parliament. It\u2019s why housing associations are now under pressure to offload even more homes at a discount. Another element of the property craze is the way many ordinary people have jumped on the buy-to-let bandwagon and built modest portfolios of homes for rent. And they will have felt vindicated after Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said recently that property was a better investment for retirement than a pension. Is it any wonder that one of the Tory government\u2019s first acts was to push through a finance bill that cut the rate of capital gains tax? Since April the level of CGT that applies to property sales has dropped from 28% to 20%. Buy-to-letters have always been lightly taxed. Now it\u2019s a bad joke. It would be easy to believe that this 1.4-million-strong group of rentiers are all baby boomers and that the average young McDonald\u2019s worker is light-years away from grabbing a slice of the action. But that would only be true if we failed to include the cascade of property wealth tumbling like a waterfall through the population. Homes are a cash machine for people during their working lives and a savings vehicle that often pays out to the next generation when they die. It\u2019s a disaster for the health of the economy, but a deeply embedded reality. Pensions have also muddied the waters. While it is true that the younger generation is missing out on the bountiful final-salary schemes enjoyed by so many baby boomers, this cash is not just spent by the over-65s on Viking river cruises. Parents and grandparents are increasingly supplementing student incomes and paying for deposits on student flats \u2013 especially since Osborne relaxed the rules on access to retirement funds. For Labour and those like myself who have campaigned on behalf of young people, the millennials\u2019 plight is obvious. But there needs to be a recognition that large sections of them have embraced the flexibility on offer from employers and that, in a wealthy economy like the UK, wealth extraction is an easier option than working in a PAYE job. The Tories, for all their bluster about industrial strategy and rewarding work, are busy cutting the tax on wealth for a reason. For young and old alike, it is the lifeline they seek: and without a secure alternative, they are not going to give it up.",
