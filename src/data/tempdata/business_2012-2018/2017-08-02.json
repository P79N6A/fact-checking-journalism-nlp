      "bodyText": "Bookmaker William Hill has reported a big increase in online sports betting in the UK over the past six months, despite feeling the absence of a major international football tournament this year and the wider squeeze on household incomes. The amount wagered on cricket, football, golf and other sports was up 13% on the same period in 2016. Average revenue per customer was up 9% and there were also gains from gamblers new to William Hill. The boost to online revenues and a 4% increase in the dividend helped push the shares up 6%, to 281p, making them the biggest riser in the FTSE 350, even though profit for the six months was down 11% to \u00a3109m as the bookmaker had to pay out on a string of wins for well-backed football teams. \u201cChelsea won six out of six of their last league matches, Spurs and Arsenal won five out six,\u201d chief executive Philip Bowcock told Reuters, adding that big results towards the end of the reporting period were also customer-friendly. Eighteen months ago, the shares were changing hands at nearly 400p, but they slid rapidly on worries about the firm\u2019s online strategy. Last summer the chief executive, James Henderson, was ousted, and Bowcock was installed as an interim boss before being installed full-time in March this year, along with a new finance chief. Attracting gamblers who want to bet on live sports events via tablet or smartphone is now a vital part of business for William Hill and rival Ladbrokes Coral Group, which both retain thousands of betting shops on British high streets. Among innovations, William Hill \u2013 which was founded as a postal and telephone betting service in 1934 \u2013 now allows gamblers to ask the company for odds on Twitter. Bowcock plans further big investments in marketing and social media to attract younger punters. In April, the firm sponsored the Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko heavyweight boxing match at Wembley, which attracted more bets than any other event bar the Grand National. Hill has missed out on industry-wide consolidation which has seen Paddy Power combine with Betfair and Ladbrokes join forces with Gala Coral. The group last year spurned a joint approach from online gambling firm 888 and bingo and casino operator Rank Group.",

      "bodyText": "Addison Lee has become the latest company to face defeat in court over its treatment of workers as \u201cindependent contractors\u201d without rights to holiday pay or the national minimum wage. The employment judge Joanna Wade issued a damning verdict against the \u00a3260m-a-year-turnover minicab firm, ruling that it had unlawfully failed to pay the cycle courier Chris Gascoigne, 48, holiday pay and attacking its attempts to \u201cfrighten off\u201d Gascoigne from challenging his employment status. The ruling at the central London employment tribunal that the cycle courier should be classed as a \u201cworker\u201d follows similar verdicts in cases brought against Uber, City Sprint, Excel and eCourier. It comes as the government considers recommendations from a Downing Street review to bring in a new law that any self-employed worker under \u201ccontrol\u201d or \u201csupervision\u201d from their contracting company should be considered a \u201cdependent contractor\u201d and benefit from holiday pay, sick pay and the minimum wage. There are now an estimated 1.1 million people in Britain\u2019s gig economy. Addison Lee\u2019s main business involves 5,000 minicab drivers, who it classes as self-employed, but it also has approximately 500 couriers. Around 40 of them use bicycles, like Gascoigne, who delivered parcels in London for Addison Lee for almost seven years before leaving in March. \u201cI am really happy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an important verdict. This is a pretty tough job and I think it is only fair considering what we do. The payments don\u2019t justify the fact we don\u2019t have these pretty basic rights.\u201d The judge highlighted Addison Lee\u2019s use of contradictory language in its contract to avoid the courier being treated as a worker. Workers were given Addison Lee-branded bags and T-shirts, responded to a central controller and used Addison Lee IT devices, including a system that had no \u201cdecline\u201d button when a job was offered. Meanwhile Gascoigne was asked to sign a contract that stated: \u201cYou agree that you are an independent contractor and that nothing in this agreement shall render you an employee, worker, agent or partner of Addison Lee.\u201d Wade said the evidence showed \u201ccouriers need to be responsive and work quickly during a tightly controlled working day\u201d and pointed to recruitment material on its website saying \u201cwe are proud of our couriers \u2013 we\u2019d love you to be part of that\u201d. She said: \u201cIt does not say: \u2018We want to find couriers who are independent and work on an ad-hoc basis. If you do account work you [will] be a self-employed sub-contractor and for non-account work we will be your agent so you carry the risk.\u2019 Not only is this confusing and wordy, it is not the way the business ran, or could run, as [Addison Lee] well knew. This is why it employed \u2018armies\u2019 of lawyers; to do the best possible job to ensure that the claimant and his colleagues did not have \u2026 worker status.\u201d Wade also said she was saddened that the contract included a clause \u201cdesigned to frighten him off from litigating\u201d. It stated that he should \u201cindemnify Addison Lee against any liability for any employment-related claim or any claim based on worker status brought by you\u201d. This, said the judge, \u201csuggests they knew the risk of portraying the claimant as self-employed\u201d. Gascoigne\u2019s case was supported by the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain. Its general secretary, Jason Moyer-Lee, said: \u201cAs if we needed any more evidence, today\u2019s judgment once again proves our point. The law is clear, and employers in the so-called gig economy have been choosing to unlawfully deprive their workers of rights. Yet another domino has fallen with regard to the inevitable conclusion that people in the so-called gig economy are workers.\u201d A spokesman for Addison Lee said: \u201cWe note the tribunal\u2019s verdict, which we will carefully review. Addison Lee is disappointed with the ruling as we have always had, and are committed to maintaining a flexible and fair relationship with cycle couriers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Over in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average may be hitting new heights, but European markets are not in the same buoyant mood. In the UK the FTSE 100 has fallen back, not helped by disappointing results from Standard Chartered and Rio Tinto. European shares continued to slip on the strength of the euro, itself partly due to the weak dollar which has helped push up the Dow. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 12.23 points or 0.16% at 7411.43 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.57% to 12,181.48 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.39% 5107.25 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.18% to 21,573.61 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.69% at 10,513.9 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.01% to 826.02 On Wall Street the Dow - having hit a new peak of 22,036.10 - is currently up 0.1% at 21,986. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV: Hopefully 22 becomes a floor rather than a ceiling....there is cash on the sidelines, returns on that are low, bonds are sitting there doing not much, and earnings are coming through. So stocks are the story. Oil prices are sliding after new figures showed that US crude stocks fell by less than expected last week. According to the Energy Information Administration, crude stockpiles dropped by 1.53m barrels to 481.89, lower than the 2.96m decline expected by analysts. But gasoline stocks fell by a higher than forecast 2.52m barrels. The figures suggested a drop in demand even as oil producers continue to try and limit demand. Next week Opec and non-Opec producers are due to meet to discuss supply issues, with the background of US shale producers continuing to ramp up to make up for any shortfalls. The latest EIA figure saw Brent crude, which was up 0.27% at $51.92 a barrel just ahead of the announcement, slip 0.7% to $51.42. Back with the Dow, and here are the biggest movers so far (and the Apple effect is evident): And here\u2019s another thing which may knock markets back. According to a professor at the Schulich School of Business, the first total solar eclipse in 38 years, set for August 21, could be a bad day for stock markets. Professor Mark Kamstra said research showed that weather-related psychological states, such as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), could cause heightened risk aversion by investors. The study found that stock market returns in countries around the world are \u201csignificantly related to the amount of daylight through the fall and winter.\u201d So basically the solar eclipse could have a similar effect. Kamstra said: \u201cHistorically, solar eclipses have inspired great fear, and, even today, some superstition remains for many people, so the markets can expect some fallout,\u201d You have been warned. The rally may not last, however. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at ETX Capital, said: It\u2019s not the fastest 1,000 point run \u2013 it\u2019s taken a lot longer than the 24 sessions it took to get from 20k to 21k \u2013 but it\u2019s indicative of a bull market speeding to a top. The Dow is now up more than 11% this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up more than 18%. But August is usually not a great month for stocks \u2013 up 5 times in the last 20 - so there is caution about how long this can be sustained beyond earnings season euphoria. And he added: It\u2019s not just Apple - earnings are delivering across the board for US equities. Whatever is happening in Washington is not bothering the stock market. It is hitting the dollar of course. A lack of any fundamental moves in bond spreads suggests the recent dollar swoon is largely politically-driven. A weaker buck is good for US stocks and increasing doubts about the Fed\u2019s capacity to raise rates quickly is also supporting equities. The punch bowl is still half full. The Dow has been hitting new highs despite the turmoil in Washington, with President Trump unable to enact his healthcare reforms while facing continuing questions over Russian involvement in the election, not to mention the shock departures of several of his key staff. It is recent positive set of company results which has taken investors\u2019 minds off the Trump turmoil, with Apple shares providing the final flourish with an opening 5% rise to a record $159 after its figures. A weaker dollar - thanks to the growing likelihood the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates again in the near future - is also helping lift shares in exporters. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said: Investors are completely immune to all the drama which is taking place over in Washington because if you look at the performance of the Dow, it appears everything is hunky dory. Although one can never underestimate the possibility of the president getting impeached but again that could mean more favourable trade relations with other countries and things moving back to normal. Thus, the impeachment trade itself could be positive for the equity market after a knee jerk reaction as the Trump trade would unwind. In earnings, it is all about Apple. The firm comfortably topped its forecast and produced stellar numbers for its revenue and profit. The big news was about the production of iPhone 8, the flagship product for the firm will hit the market on time with no issues around production. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has broken through the 22,000 barrier for the first time, boosted by a host of positive corporate earnings reports, the latest being Apple. If the Dow does hit 22,000 for the first time today, Apple won\u2019t be the only one taking the credit... The ADP employment report is out and has come in below forecasts. Private sector employment increased by 178,000 in July, weaker than the 185,000 predicted by economists. However, the number for June was revised up sharply to show a 191,000 increase in jobs, compared with an earlier estimate of 158,000. The services industry accounted for the vast majority of new jobs in July: Traders at spread betting firm IG are predicting the Dow Jones will open just shy of the 22,000 mark when Wall Street opens: Time for a market update. Major markets across Europe are in the red, with the FTSE 100 extending losses, and now down 29 points at 7,395. FTSE 100: -0.4% at 7,395 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 12,213 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,121 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 21,580 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.5% at 10,534 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 379 Investors await the bell in Wall Street, where the Dow could surpass 22,000 for the first time. Investors are braced for the latest decision on interest rates from the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, which will be delivered at noon tomorrow. Although markets have brought forward expectations for the timing of the first rate hike since July 2007, economists polled by Reuters don\u2019t think tomorrow will be the day. They are forecasting another split among MPC members - after a shock 5-3 split in June. This month two members of the committee are expected to vote for a rise in rates - to 0.5% from a current record low of 0.25% - while six are expected to vote in favour of no change. The pound is holding on to earlier gains against the dollar, up 0.3% at $1.3234, helped by a broadly weaker dollar. Sterling is now at a near 11-month high: Eduardo Gorab, property economist at Capital Economics, says the July construction PMI was \u201cunderwhelming\u201d. Here is the data in chart form: Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the weaker than expected construction PMI shows Brexit uncertainty is weighing on commercial building: The sharp fall in the construction PMI in July suggests that the renewed slowdown recorded by the official data in the second quarter won\u2019t be short-lived. The decline in the PMI primarily reflected a big drop in the commercial activity index to its lowest level since immediately after the EU referendum. Commercial clients reportedly delayed decisions due to worries about the economic outlook and elevated political uncertainty. The adverse impact of Brexit uncertainty on commercial work likely will grow if, as we expect, exit talks progress slowly. Indeed, more firms will activate Brexit contingency plans as the Article 50 deadline draws closer, freeing up office space and sapping demand for new commercial projects. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club: Weakened economy activity, a lacklustre housing market and appreciable economic and political uncertainties threaten to be a damaging combination for the construction sector over the coming months. Meanwhile, construction companies are currently still being squeezed by elevated input costs. House building activity could be pressurised by extended slow housing market activity and subdued prices amid weakened consumer fundamentals. There is a risk that some companies may also be cautious about committing to major projects if there is any increase in level of uncertainty over the coming months. The detail of the July construction PMI survey shows reveals a sharp slowdown in commercial building such as offices as shops. Activity in that part of the sector actually fell. Growth in housebuilding meanwhile slowed, doing to little to raise hopes that Britain\u2019s housing shortage will be solved any time soon. The strongest area was civil engineering, where growth actually accelerated in July. The message from firms to appear one of waning confidence among clients, who were unwilling to commit to major spending decisions last month. Mike Chappell, managing director for construction at Lloyds commercial banking, is hoping July was a blip for the sector rather than the beginning of a broader trend. It has been a mixed month for the sector, so this dip in the reading is not a major surprise. The hope is that it is a blip rather than the beginning of a downward trend. Results from commercial contractors show margins are holding up reasonably well and improving. Meanwhile, any nervousness about pipelines has eased for many firms by the awarding of contracts for HS2. The principal headwinds \u2013 particularly input price inflation and concerns about the future supply of EU labour \u2013 remain, so the focus is on organic growth, continuing to boost margins to above the 2% mark and a disciplined approach to contract bidding. These priorities are still key if the industry is to mitigate the risks in the current trading environment. The Markit/CIPS construction PMI has come in a lot weaker than expected. The headline index combining output, orders and employment in the sector fell to 51.9 in July, from 54.8 in June. Anything above 50 signals growth. Economists polled by Reuters predicted a much smaller dip in the headline number to 54.5. Tim Moore from IHS Markit: July data reveals a growth slowdown in the UK construction sector, mainly driven by lower volumes of commercial development and a loss of momentum for house building. Worries about the economic outlook and heightened political uncertainty were key factors contributing to subdued demand. Construction firms reported that clients were more reluctant to spend and had opted to take longer in committing to new projects. More soon. The dollar is under further pressure this morning, as political drama in the US continues to unfold. The dollar\u2019s loss is the pound\u2019s gain, with sterling nearing an 11-month high. The pound is up 0.3% against the US currency, at $1.3234, and the euro is also up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.1839. Apple shares hit a fresh record hight on Tuesday after the US tech giant announced it had sold 41m iPhones in the last three months. Investors were also reassured as Apple suggested rumours of a delay to the launch of the iPhone 8, due in September, were incorrect. Read our full story here: The FTSE 100 is off 19 points this morning, with commodity stocks dominating the list of the biggest fallers: Commodity shares are down on lower oil prices, with the Brent crude down 1% this morning at $51.29 a barrel. Rising US stocks of oil added to concerns about oversupply, pushing prices down. Figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed that US crude stocks rose by 1.8m barrels to 488.8m in the week ending 28 July. Markets in Europe are mixed this morning. Shares have failed to get any major boost from the Apple-led tech rally that drove Wall Street higher on Tuesday. The scores so far in Europe: FTSE 100: -0.3% at 7,405 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 12,266 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 5,113 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.1% at 21,624 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,577 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 380 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We have some upbeat predictions for the UK economy this morning, as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research publishes its latest set of forecasts. Economists at the thinktank predict growth will accelerate to 1.9% in 2018 from 1.7% this year. They believe the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote will give that long-awaited boost to exports. As a result of stronger growth, NIESR says policymakers at the Bank of England will be ready to vote for a rise in interest rates in the spring. Previously they predicted the first rate hike would come after the second quarter of 2019, when Britain had left the European Union. Jagjit Chadha, the institute\u2019s director, says rate rises from the current all-time low of 0.25% will be a slow process: We are not talking about a rapid return to higher interest rates, but signalling that process \u2013 even if it takes five to seven years \u2013 will help banks rebuild their balance sheets and create a healthier financial system. Here is our story on the NIESR forecasts: Also today we have the latest healthcheck on the UK construction sector at 9.30 with the publication of the latest PMI survey. It is expected to show a slight dip in growth in the sector in July. At 13.15 the ADP employment survey for July will provide the latest insight into the US jobs market.",

The Dow is now up more than 11% this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up more than 18%. But August is usually not a great month for stocks \u2013 up 5 times in the last 20 - so there is caution about how long this can be sustained beyond earnings season euphoria.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not just Apple - earnings are delivering across the board for US equities. Whatever is happening in Washington is not bothering the stock market. It is hitting the dollar of course. A lack of any fundamental moves in bond spreads suggests the recent dollar swoon is largely politically-driven. A weaker buck is good for US stocks and increasing doubts about the Fed\u2019s capacity to raise rates quickly is also supporting equities.

Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors are completely immune to all the drama which is taking place over in Washington because if you look at the performance of the Dow, it appears everything is hunky dory.

Thus, the impeachment trade itself could be positive for the equity market after a knee jerk reaction as the Trump trade would unwind. </p> <p>In earnings, it is all about Apple.

      "bodyText": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gone above the 22,000 mark for the first time, boosted by bumper company earnings and a weak dollar, with investors shrugging off the latest upheavals in the White House. The move comes five months after the Dow passed the 21,000 level, having previously crossed 20,000 in January. This year it is up about 11%, and since the election of Donald Trump as US president in November, it has risen more than 20%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are also near record highs. This latest Wall Street surge has been helped by forecast-beating results from Apple, which also pleased investors by dismissing suggestions its forthcoming iPhone 8 could be delayed. Apple shares jumped nearly 6% to a record $159 (\u00a3120), before slipping back to $157 by lunchtime. The Dow had added 0.2% to 22,007 by lunchtime after hitting a peak of 22,036 during the morning. It is still on track for another record close, the sixth in a row. US markets have been buoyed for much of this year by hopes that President Trump would unveil tax reforms and infrastructure plans to boost the country\u2019s economy. However, recently his plans to abolish the Obamacare healthcare system received a setback, casting doubt on his ability to push through the rest of his legislative programme. The threat of impeachment is also hovering in the background, while several key members of his team in the White House have resigned or been fired. However, strong company results from the likes of Goldman Sachs, Boeing and Apple have kept investors buying despite the concerns over Trump. Two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results, for the three months to the end of June, and about 72% of them have beaten expectations. Meanwhile, the dollar has weakened, partly on concerns over Trump and also because of the growing belief that the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again in the immediate future with the economy showing signs of running out of steam. Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV: \u201cReturns on [cash] are low, bonds are sitting there doing not much and earnings are coming through. So stocks are the story.\u201d On Wednesday, new figures showed weaker than expected US jobs figures for July, with private sector employment rising by 178,000, rather than the 185,000 predicted by economists. On Friday, the official non-farm payroll numbers are forecast to show a 180,000 increase, down from June\u2019s figure of 187,000. The dip in the dollar \u2013 which benefits US exporters \u2013 pushed the pound to an 11-month high of $1.3245 against the US currency. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: \u201cUS investors have continued to turn a deaf ear to the ongoing political intrigue unfolding in Washington DC [and] for now the direction of travel continues to remain positive.\u201d",

This year it is up about 11%, and since the election of Donald Trump as US president in November, it has risen more than 20%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are also near record highs.</p> <p>This latest Wall Street surge has been helped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/01/apple-41-million-iphone-8-stocks-trading-tim-cook\">forecast-beating results from Apple</a>, which also pleased investors by dismissing suggestions its forthcoming iPhone 8 could be delayed.

It is still on track for another record close, the sixth in a row.</p> <p>US markets have been buoyed for much of this year by hopes that President Trump would unveil tax reforms and infrastructure plans to boost the country\u2019s economy.

The threat of impeachment is also hovering in the background, while several key members of his team in the White House have resigned or been fired.</p> <p>However, strong company results from the likes of Goldman Sachs, Boeing and Apple have kept investors buying despite the concerns over Trump. Two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results, for the three months to the end of June, and about 72% of them have beaten expectations.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the dollar has weakened, partly on concerns over Trump and also because of the growing belief that the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again in the immediate future with the economy showing signs of running out of steam.<br></p> <p>Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, told Bloomberg TV: \u201cReturns on [cash] are low, bonds are sitting there doing not much and earnings are coming through.

      "bodyText": "Asda has posted its worst annual figures since being taken over by the American grocer Walmart, as fierce competition in the UK supermarket sector took its toll. Britain\u2019s third biggest supermarket chain admitted performance was \u201cbehind expectations\u201d after pre-tax profit for 2016 fell 19% to \u00a3791.7m. Accounts filed at Companies House also showed sales fell to \u00a321.6bn from \u00a322.3bn as shoppers flocked to cheaper rivals. Asda has trailed behind Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons, and is the worst performer of the UK\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d grocers. The former chief executive Andy Clarke was replaced by the Walmart veteran Sean Clarke, who has attempted to breathe new life into the business. He took the helm last summer. He has focused on dropping prices, boosting the quality of food ranges and improving customer service. While underlying sales for the year plunged 5.7%, Asda pointed to a recent improvement in trading. The latest industry figures showed Asda attracted an additional 398,000 shoppers in the 12 weeks to 16 July. The Kantar data showed Asda\u2019s sales for the period grew by 1% compared with the same period last year. In May, the grocer also reported sales in the first quarter had fallen 2.8% compared with the same period the previous year \u2013 an improvement on the 2.9% fall in the fourth quarter. Second-quarter figures are expected this month. The accounts also showed Andy Clarke and the former chief customer officer Barry Williams, who has also left the business, received a combined \u00a32.5m payoff. The firm did not break down the share of this sum. Sean Clarke and the former Sainsbury\u2019s executive Roger Burnley, who started as chief operations officer recently, have focused their turnaround efforts on the retail basics. The finance director, Alex Russo, said: \u201cOur sales performance, relative to the market, was behind our expectations. However, in the last quarter of 2016, we saw an improvement following the changes made to our ranges and investment in price and service.\u201d Asda also reported an operating cashflow of \u00a31.41bn, an increase of 8%, and said a dividend of \u00a3450m was paid to Walmart. All the \u201cbig four\u201d grocers have suffered in recent years from seismic changes to the industry. Consumers have swapped their weekly shop for more frequent visits to smaller convenience stores as they seek to cut down on food waste at home. There has also been a shift away from bricks and mortar stores as some prefer buying online. While shoppers can buy Asda food over the internet, the supermarket has been hit harder than most because it refuses to join rivals in opening smaller stores. The \u201cbig four\u201d have also come under attack from discounters Aldi and Lidl, which can undercut their bigger rivals by stocking fewer high-quality ranges. They are able to negotiate rock-bottom prices by buying entire crops from farmers while bigger supermarkets buy smaller quantities from a larger number of suppliers so they can offer more choice. Asda again has been affected more than the others because its biggest point of difference was price, something that has been cannibalised in recent years with the low-cost operators. Asda has been too slow in responding to that competition, at a time when its arch rival Tesco has managed to turn its business around. Tom Berry, retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cAsda has chosen to focus on price rather than range and in-store experience, which has clearly been the wrong strategy.\u201d Notes in Asda\u2019s accounts showed it was focusing on cutting costs: \u201cOur commitment to the ASDA \u2018low cost operating model\u2019 has resulted in improving operating efficiencies and delivering productivity savings across stores and distribution centres.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British Airways travellers faced delays at Heathrow and Gatwick on Wednesday after a temporary check-in problem. The disruption came about two months after more than 670 flights were cancelled due to a power failure over the spring bank holiday weekend. A statement from British Airways said: \u201cCustomers are being checked in as normal after an earlier problem was resolved. We are sorry for the temporary check-in problems, which caused some delays for our customers first thing this morning. \u201cThis issue is now resolved and our staff are working flat out to help customers get away on their holidays.\u201d In May, the airline was hit by an IT failure, which affected about 75,000 passengers as flights were cancelled. It took three days for the carrier to resume a full schedule. The airline said the IT shutdown was caused by an \u201cuncontrolled return of power\u201d after an outage that physically damaged servers at its data centre. It has been estimated that BA could face a \u00a3100m compensation bill. The delays came as the government was urged to use \u201cwhatever influence it can\u201d to pressure EU states to adequately staff their airports after British holidaymakers faced chaos at passport controls. Tourists arriving in some popular destinations have been met with immigration lines hundreds of metres long \u2013 some having to wait for up to four hours according to airline lobby groups \u2013 as staff carry out tighter counter-terror checks. Airlines UK, an industry body representing UK-registered carriers, said it had warned the Department for Transport about the problem in May, although they were told by ministers the issue had eased. Tim Alderslade, the body\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cClearly, the situation has changed markedly as we enter peak holiday season and it is now up to the UK government to work with industry to use whatever influence it can within the EU to persuade Schengen member states to resource their border operations properly.\u201d New EU rules introduced after terror attacks in Paris and Brussels require countries to carry out more stringent checks on travellers entering and leaving the Schengen area, which allows passport-free movement across much of the EU. The change means the details of passengers from non-Schengen countries, such as the UK, are run through databases to alert authorities if they are known to pose a threat. However, Alderslade said attempts to improve resources at border controls had \u201cfailed to happen thus far\u201d. Pictures on social media in recent days have shown long queues of passengers in crowded terminals. Lobby group Airlines For Europe (A4E) said passengers arriving at airports in Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Belgium were being forced to endure long waits to get through immigration. The group, which represents carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways\u2019 parent company IAG, claimed some passengers were missing their flights because of the issue. A4E\u2019s managing director, Thomas Reynaert, said passengers had been left \u201cdevastated\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "London\u2019s world-class reputation for corporate governance is at risk if the City regulator presses ahead with plans to water down stock market rules for companies owned by sovereign wealth funds, business leaders have warned. The Financial Conduct Authority published plans last month to introduce rules that were regarded as an attempt by the regulator to attract the world\u2019s biggest ever flotation \u2013 of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company \u2013 to London. The City is eager to safeguard its position as a leading financial centre after the Brexit vote. Aramco is in the process of deciding which financial centre to choose for the sale of 5% of its shares. The company could be valued at $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) in a move that would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for investment bankers, lawyers and other advisers. But in a critical assessment of the FCA\u2019s proposals, the Institute of Directors said that while the short-term desire to attract foreign companies to London was understandable, a relaxation of the rules might harm the UK\u2019s reputation for strong corporate governance, diminishing its competitive advantage in the long term. \u201cThe IoD is strongly committed to sustaining the City of London as a global financial centre as we embark on leaving the European Union. Attracting leading firms from around the world to list on the London Stock Exchange will be increasingly important, and this could include sovereign-owned companies,\u201d said Stephen Martin, the director general of the IoD. The group said the proposals did little to address the risks associated with sovereign-controlled companies, including political interference and the ability of national governments to undermine the rights of minority shareholders and the authority of directors. The FCA\u2019s proposals would allow state-owned companies to qualify for a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange in a newly created sub-segment that exempts them from two criteria generally required before a company can be listed. One relates to how the company and the controlling shareholder conduct deals with each other, and the other allows investors a vote on independent directors. The IoD urged the FCA to not only reconsider its plans to waive current rules to accommodate such companies, but to strengthen them. \u201cGood corporate governance serves to enhance business performance, protect investors and maintain the reputation of UK plc and we do not believe the proposals in the consultation paper seek to strengthen these objectives,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe have no objection to the creation of a new sub-set of the premium listing category for sovereign-controlled companies. However, the proposed rule changes for the new premium listed category are unjustified and could create governance problems.\u201d The FCA said it would not comment on \u201cindividual consultation feedback\u201d, but last month Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the regulator, justified the changes on the basis that sovereign owners behave differently to other companies. The deadline for consultation submissions to the FCA is 13 October. Despite its size, Saudi Aramco would not quality for an entry in the FTSE 100 under the index\u2019s rules. As well as a premium listing in London, the rules include an assigned nationality of UK, and minimum free floats of 25% of a company\u2019s shares for UK incorporated companies and 50% for non-UK incorporated companies.",
