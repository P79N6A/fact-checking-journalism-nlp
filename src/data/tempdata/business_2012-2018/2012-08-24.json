We caught 18m tonnes of industrial fish last year, which represents 20% of all fish caught worldwide,\" says Gorjan Nikolik, associate director of animal protein at Rabobank.</p> <p>These fish are caught in massive quantities, dried, minced and ground down into fish meal [a brown powder made mostly from fish bones and fish offal] and fish oil [which is extracted from the tissues of oily fish].</p> <p>\"After two years of declining prices, fish meal and fish oil are becoming expensive again.

But this is no ordinary year. This year salmon have been hungry.</p> <p>\"In 2012 the water temperature has been a couple of degrees warmer in the north Atlantic than normal.

As it explained: \"A formation drill stem test (DST) has been performed on the Garn Formation, however no hydrocarbons flowed to surface.\" The company is now hoping that the lack of oil is a local issue and the rest of the reservoir is more useful to its future. The news sent the AIM-listed company's shares down 12.8p, 8%, to 146.5p. The well is part owned and operated by British Gas parent company, Centrica (up 3.6p at 326.9p), which has a 40% stake, Suncor has a 30% and Faroe the remaining 30%. Graham Stewart, Chief Executive of Faroe Petroleum, said: Although the DST results on the Garn formation were disappointing we take encouragement from the discoveries made at multiple horizons and that the poor flow characteristics of the Jurassic reservoir observed in this well are not seen in the other nearby producing fields. We will continue to evaluate the large amount of data that has been collected in the Cooper well to try to resolve why the Garn formation is tight and whether this is likely to be a local or a field wide reservoir phenomenon. Analysts seemed unconcerned with the latest development. Leila Reddy at Panmure Gordon said: The DST test on the Copper well was disappointing with no hydrocarbons flowing to the surface. The silver lining is that this flow characteristic may be a localised rather than a field wide reservoir property. We have revised our target price to 218p (previously 225p). And Sam Wahab at Seymour Pierce said: This is clearly disappointing news for Faroe, with Cooper previously being the company's only exploration success story so far this year. Nevertheless, Faroe's high impact drilling campaign continues with the North Uist well with results expected imminently. In addition, the company intends to drill the Spaniards well in the UK North Sea in October 2012.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's economy shrank less than first feared in the second quarter, but remains mired in the longest double-dip recession since the second world war. GDP fell by 0.5% between April and June compared with the previous quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics. The figure, which was in line with economists' expectations, was revised from the 0.7% decline statisticians had estimated last month. However, the economy has been shrinking for three consecutive quarters in the country's second recession in four years. Bleak business surveys suggest it is unlikely to improve quickly, while the Bank of England estimates growth to be at a standstill for this year. GDP is at about the same level as it was in the middle of 2010, so growth has been broadly flat over the last two years, the ONS said. Output is still more than 4% below its pre- recession peak at the start of 2008. The chancellor, George Osborne, came under intense pressure to boost the economy this week when government borrowing showed a shock increase in July. Friday's figures showed consumer spending dropped by 0.4% in the second quarter, while exports fell 1.7% and imports climbed 1.4%. Trade shaved 1% off GDP, the biggest drag on growth since the second quarter of 1998. Construction slumped by 3.9%, less than first thought, but still a sharp fall, and Manufacturing output was down 0.9. M% while the service sector shrank by 0.1%. The Treasury gave a cautious welcome to the upward revision, with a spokesman saying: \"Britain is dealing with some very deep-rooted problems at home and a very serious debt crisis abroad, and that is why the healing of the economy is proving to be a slow and difficult process. Compared with two years ago, the deficit is down, inflation is down and there are more private sector jobs.\" Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, was not impressed. \"Any small upward revision in growth figures is welcome, but our economy is still in the longest double-dip recession since the second world war and that's why borrowing so far this year has risen by a quarter compared to last year. \"David Cameron and George Osborne's plan has badly failed. Since the spending review our economy has shrunk by 0.6%. And with Britain just one of two G20 countries in a double-dip it is clear that this is a recession made in Downing Street.\" Economists argued that Friday's figures did not alter the picture of an economy struggling to return to growth. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"The GDP figures may in the future be revised up further. Nonetheless, given the drags from the fiscal squeeze, eurozone crisis and high domestic debt levels, we still doubt that a strong recovery lies ahead.\" The Bank of England has estimated that the extra jubilee bank holiday in June knocked about 0.5% off GDP in the second quarter. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF manufacturers' trade body, said: \"Whilst the revised estimate suggests the economic situation, particularly for manufacturing and construction, wasn't quite as dire as first thought there are clearly some big question marks around where we go from here. Even if activity was displaced rather than lost, we're still looking at an overall contraction for the economy this year.\" By comparison Germany grew by 0.3% between April and June, although weak manufacturing and services PMI figures released on Thursday suggest that even Europe's economic powerhouse is going backwards in the current quarter. The eurozone, and the European Union as a whole, contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter, following flat GDP in the first quarter.",

Three consecutive quarterly declines in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2011 are difficult to reconcile with rising employment and falls in the jobless rate.</p> <p>However, some of the new detail is concerning. Exports, investment and consumer spending all fell over the quarter while imports rose. It is clear that domestic austerity measures and the eurozone crisis are putting serious pressures on both businesses and consumers, while the rebalancing of the economy towards net exports is proving difficult. Government consumption rose over the past year in spite of the fall in GDP, which contradicts the impression that public spending cuts are happening too quickly.</p> <p>While gloomy ONS figures risk damaging confidence unnecessarily, it is clear that the UK economy has been stagnant for some time, and we need to see bold action to drive growth. While it is important to persevere with spending cuts, the government must take initiatives to boost infrastructure spending, support the construction sector and move towards the creation of a business bank.</p> <h2>Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>UK GDP was revised up in the second quarter as expected, but the revision is very small in the big picture and means that output is still more than 4% below its pre-recession peak.</p> <p>The 0.1% fall in services output was left unrevised, suggesting that the upward revision to retail sales in the second quarter was offset by greater weakness in the rest of the sector. Remember that the extra bank holiday probably knocked about 0.5% off GDP. But even so, underlying output is just stagnating. What's more, the spending breakdown shows a strong contribution to growth in the second quarter from stockbuilding (an unsustainable source of strength). Consumer spending and investment both fell and net trade knocked a full percentage point off quarterly growth. Of course, the GDP figures may in the future be revised up further. Nonetheless, given the drags from the fiscal squeeze, eurozone crisis and high domestic debt levels, we still doubt that a strong recovery lies ahead.</p> <h2>Philip Rush, UK economist at Nomura</h2> <p>At its second attempt, the ONS estimated growth to be 0.2 percentage points stronger, taking it toward our estimate from last month (-0.3%), but even this did not revise away all of the previous surprise. \"Growth\" of -0.5% quarter-on-quarter remains a disappointingly weak outcome, even if the diamond jubilee did subtract about 0.4 points from it, as we still assume. Nor was there much positive news in this specific release.</p> <p>We doubt that any revisions will be sufficient to \"solve\" the \"productivity puzzle\" though, which we still believe to be genuinely weak and mostly structural in nature.</p> <h2>Chris Crowe, UK economist at Barclays Capital</h2> <p>Although headline GDP growth was in line with expectations, we interpret the news in the expenditure components as negative for the UK growth outlook. First, final domestic demand shrank by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter. By contrast, final domestic demand grew by 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2011 and first quarter of 2012. By this measure, the downturn now looks a lot more entrenched than previously, when it largely reflected stockbuilding. Stockbuilding tends to be volatile and subject to revision, whereas the weakness in final domestic demand is more likely to be sustained.</p> <p>Second, the -1 percentage point net trade contribution was even more negative than the -0.6 points we had been expecting and the -0.4 points seen in the first quarter. This illustrates that the weakness in the UK's major trading partners, which is also looking more entrenched, is now having a significant negative effect on the UK economy.</p> <p>Third, we do not see the continued resilience of government consumption as sustainable, not least as the government may need to find additional spending cuts to keep its austerity programme on track. Although we expect the unwinding of the jubilee effect to boost growth in the third quarter, the underlying outlook now looks more depressed.</p> <h2>James Knightley, UK economist at ING</h2> <p>The first reading of GDP was only based on 44% of the total data that is used to determine the \"final\" estimate. Consequently, most of that first report was based on the statisticians' own estimates, which have subsequently been found to be too pessimistic with both construction output and manufacturing output revised significantly higher. Today's first revision is based on around two-thirds of the data used to produce the \"final estimate\" so we could yet see further upward revisions \u2013 typically GDP is revised by around 0.4 percentage points between the initial and \"final\" readings.</p> <p>In terms of today's report, it is important to remember there was the loss of a working day in the quarter for the Queen's diamond jubilee, which the Bank of England estimate knocked around 0.5 percentage points off growth. Consequently, this offers support to those who have the view that the UK is merely stagnating rather than descending into a deeper and deeper recession. Indeed, rising tax revenues, rising aggregate hours worked and rising employment don't usually occur in a recession, while business surveys suggest the UK is outperforming the eurozone rather than undershooting, as the GDP report suggests. In any case, GDP should rebound reasonably strongly in the third quarter on an unwinding of working day effects and possibly a mild Olympic boost.</p> <h2>Ranvir Singh, chief executive of market analyst RANsquawk</h2> <p>The economy is still under water.
