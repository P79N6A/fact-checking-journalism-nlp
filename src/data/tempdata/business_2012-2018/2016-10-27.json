      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has been told by a group of private investors that it will be taken to court over a \u00a31.25bn claim related to its 2008 cash call. The RBoS Shareholder Action Group, which represents 27,000 retail investors, issued its warning after a report that other shareholders were considering settling out of court. The group, one of at least three bringing claims related to the rights issue in 2008, said: \u201cWe look forward to seeing Fred Goodwin and RBS in court in March.\u201d The group said it was the only one suing Goodwin, who was chief executive of RBS at the time of its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, and three of the bank\u2019s former executives. The legal action is said to be \u201con behalf of thousands of investors, both private and institutional, who lost money by subscribing for shares during the 2008 RBS rights issue\u201d. The announcement was made ahead of RBS\u2019s third-quarter results, which will be scrutinised for any further provisions relating to the case. In August, RBS set aside \u00a3700m for the case after an attempt at mediation talks in July failed to reach a settlement. The total claim by all the investors involved comes to \u00a34bn. The court action by disgruntled investors is one of many factors that could feature in the bank\u2019s results on Friday, when it is expected to pile up more losses on top of \u00a352bn already incurred since the bailout. An update on the potential spin-out of 300 branches \u2013 which were going to be rebranded Williams &amp; Glyn \u2013 is expected, while the bank is also likely to face questions about the alleged mistreatment of small-business customers. RBS has also told investors it faces a hard-to-quantify settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) over the way mortgage bonds were sold in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said earlier this month that he could not sell off any of the 73% taxpayer stake for now. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the disposal of RBS shares at a price that recovers taxpayers\u2019 investment is not practical at the moment,\u201d he said at the time, citing the problems over the spin-out of Williams &amp; Glyn and the ongoing case with the DoJ.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy shrugged off the uncertainty surrounding June\u2019s referendum vote to leave the European Union and maintain the best performance among the world\u2019s leading economies with growth of 0.5% in the three months since the poll. The powerful showing, which defied City forecasts that gross domestic product (GDP) growth would more than halve to 0.3%, came after the dominant services sector expanded at a faster rate in the quarter to the end of September than during the three months running up to the referendum vote. But the figures were marred by a contraction in agriculture, construction and manufacturing that prompted business groups to urge the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to use the autumn statement next month to support measures that boost investment and productivity. Overall, GDP growth slowed from 0.7% in the previous quarter. Consumer confidence surveys also indicated an increasingly gloomy mood among consumers as the feelgood factor from low interest rates and inflation was replaced by concerns that the pound\u2019s sharp decline would increase shop prices and hit UK living standards hard next year. GfK\u2019s consumer confidence index, which assesses respondents\u2019 outlook for the next 12 months, decreased by two points to -3, ending a revival since June\u2019s Brexit vote that pushed the index riseup to -1 after falling to -12. The GDP data from the Office for National Statistics is the first official verdict on how the economy has performed since Britain voted to leave the European Union. The figures rule out the prospect of a technical recession \u2013 defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 in the second half of the year which was predicted by many economists before the referendum vote. Hammond said the figures demonstrated the resilience of the UK economy, which was \u201cwell-placed\u201d to deal with the challenges and opportunities created by the EU referendum. The chancellor said: \u201cWe are moving into a period of negotiations with the EU and we are determined to get the very best deal for households and businesses. The economy will need to adjust to a new relationship with the EU, but we are well-placed to take advantage of opportunities ahead.\u201d However, several City analysts warned that the post-referendum bounce would prove to be temporary. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg bank, said the resilient post-referendum performance \u201cdoes not say anything about the UK\u2019s ability to perform outside of the EU\u201d. He said: \u201cThe good quarter of growth merely reflects the momentum heading into the vote and the healthy underlying fundamentals after some three years of good growth. The data does not alter our long-term view that Brexit will lower UK trend growth, to around 1.8% from 2.2% per year, via less trade, migration and investment with its major market, the EU.\u201d Business groups warned the chancellor that industry remained vulnerable to uncertainty after the Brexit vote and he should open his cheque book to prevent a longer-term slump in output. Mike Spicer, director of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cAlthough many manufacturers saw a bounce this summer, in part from the lower exchange rate, this was not enough to prevent a contraction in industrial output overall. Many have found themselves on the wrong side of currency movements \u2013 facing increased costs for imported components.\u201d For this reason \u201cboosting business confidence must be a key task for government in the months ahead\u201d, he said. The 0.5% rise beat the latest forecasts from Bank of England policymakers, who were predicting at the time of the August inflation report that third quarter growth would come in at 0.1%. Threadneedle Street is likely to use the data as a reason to delay any further stimulus to the economy until next year, placing further pressure on the Treasury to support industry. The main boost to growth came from the transport, storage and communication sectors which grew at its fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2009, rising 2.2% over the period in contrast to 0.6% in the second quarter. The ONS said higher output in the film, music and TV industries was the main driver, indicating that Britain\u2019s creative industries sailed through the uncertainty surrounding the referendum unscathed. The expansion of the services sector helped to offset the steepest fall in construction since the third quarter of 2012, with a slide in new housebuilding dragging the entire building industry down 1.4% between July and September. Manufacturing dropped by 1% in the third quarter, while production fell 0.4% and agriculture slipped by 0.7%, prompting the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, to say the government needed to do more to help. \u201cWe can\u2019t yet say what impact Brexit will have on our economy, but these figures show there\u2019s no room for complacency. British manufacturing is still struggling, and now faces real uncertainty following the vote to leave the EU. \u201cThe government must use next month\u2019s autumn statement to boost Britain\u2019s jobs and wages. This means investing in infrastructure like roads, rail and homes, and raising the national minimum wage.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy has been growing for 15 consecutive quarters. The relative resilience of the UK economy since the Brexit vote on 23 June has largely been attributed to a willingness among consumers to keep spending, as well as strength in the services sector. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that Britain will be the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial countries in 2016, with growth of 1.8%. The Washington-based fund accepted that its warning of a post-Brexit-vote financial crash had proved too pessimistic.",

      "bodyText": "The cost of the payment protection insurance scandal has topped \u00a340bn after Barclays took another \u00a3600m hit to pay compensation to customers who were mis-sold the product. The extra provision, announced as the bank reported a 10% fall in nine-month profits, takes Barclays\u2019 costs to \u00a38.4bn. Data compiled by the thinkthank New City Agenda shows that this top up for Barclays has pushed the total provisions incurred by the industry to \u00a340.2bn. Lloyds Banking Group makes up \u00a317bn of that total. Barclays said its extra provision was caused by the cutoff point of June 2019 for claims, set by the Financial Conduct Authority. It added: \u201cWe will continue to review the adequacy of the provision levels in respect of the FCA\u2019s proposals, which remain subject to consultation.\u201d In the midst of an overhaul being led by chief executive Jes Staley, the bank insisted it was \u201copen for business\u201d after the Brexit vote. But Staley admitted he was considering what changes it might need to make to its business as the UK made plans to leave the EU. Staley said: \u201cWe are looking at our options. We will take incremental steps. We are engaged in active discussions with the British government. Our desire is to stay as fully invested in the UK as we can.\u201d This week, the Observer reported a warning from Anthony Browne, the chief executive of the British Bankers Association, that bosses had their hands \u201cquivering over the relocate button\u201d. Staley said while Barclays was looking at its options, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say our finger is quivering. Our intention is to stay as much invested in London as we can. We are a British bank.\u201d In July, Staley said operations might need to be strengthened in Ireland if the government did not clinch a passport deal that gave access to the remaining 27 EU countries. The bank\u2019s shares were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100, despite the extra charge for PPI and the \u00a3150m hit to cover costs incurred in reducing office space because of job cuts. The bank would not disclose which office was affected, but it has been reported that it has been in talks about leasing space in Canary Wharf to the government. The shares closed 4.5% higher, at 190p, after the bank reported that its profits fell to \u00a32.9bn in the nine months to September, triggered by a loss in the non-core division that houses the operations Staley has earmarked for sale or closure. Staley joined Barclays in December and set about selling off the bank\u2019s operations in Africa. He said: \u201cThe growing momentum in attaining our strategic goals means we can feel optimistic of our prospects of completing the restructuring of Barclays \u2013 a restructuring to a simplified, transatlantic, consumer, corporate and investment bank with the capacity to deliver sustainable, high-quality returns for shareholders. This quarter has seen us take another important stride toward that state.\u201d The vote to leave the EU had been a political shock, Staley said, but consumers had recovered swiftly. \u201cThe referendum was a political shock, not an economic shock. I think consumers have recovered from that, but there has been an impact in the currency, which directly impacts the consumer,\u201d said Staley. Barclays said it remained in discussions with the US Department of Justice over a settlement related to mortgage bond mis-selling.",

      "bodyText": "European Union leaders have expressed hope of signing a trade deal with Canada after Belgian politicians overcame differences that had been blocking the treaty. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, confirmed that leaders of five regional parliaments had reached an agreement with the federal government shortly after midday on Thursday. He tweeted: The Belgian compromise \u2013 a four-page text that sits alongside the 1,600-page treaty \u2013 was approved by ambassadors from 28 EU member states on Thursday afternoon. Belgium\u2019s regional parliaments are expected to endorse the text on Friday, paving the way for the deal to come into force on a temporary basis. Canada\u2019s foreign minister St\u00e9phane Dion said he was \u201cprudently optimistic\u201d that the treaty could be signed: \u201cIf it happens, it is excellent news.\u201d But he added that \u201ca scalded cat fears cold water\u201d. The Belgian compromise came too late for an EU-Canada summit that had been scheduled for Thursday. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had been due to meet the EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels, but decided at the last minute not to get on the plane, as Belgian politicians wrangled over the agreement late on Wednesday night. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the EU trade commissioner leading the trade talks with Canada, said she hoped a date could be set soon to sign the accord. Tusk, the European council president, sounded a note of caution, tweeting: The comprehensive economic and trade agreement, known as Ceta, which has been seven years in the making, stumbled near the finish line amid strong opposition from the Belgian regional parliament of Wallonia. The EU requires all 28 member states to support Ceta for the treaty to come into force, but the Belgian federal government, which has always backed the trade treaty, was barred from giving its consent because of opposition from regional parliaments in Wallonia and Brussels. Paul Magnette, Wallonia\u2019s minister-president, who had been leading opposition to the agreement, had wanted to reopen talks with Canada, but the EU institutions insisted that was impossible. Wallonia has been nervous about exposing its agricultural sector to competition from Canadian farmers. Magnette had also raised objections to a proposed court system for settling disputes between foreign investors and governments. One concession he won means that Belgium would be able to go to the European court of justice to determine whether a system of investor-state tribunals were compatible with EU law. The four-page document contains a guarantee that the Belgian government will assess the socio-economic and environmental impact of Ceta. The Walloon minister-president, who has been dubbed \u201cSuper-Magnette\u201d in the Belgian media, said: \u201cWallonia is extremely happy that our demands have been heard.\u201d Speaking of the delay, Magnette said he was \u201csorry for our European partners and for the Canadians, but what we managed to get here is important not just for Wallonians, but for all Europeans\u201d. The special court that Ceta would create has proved so controversial that the commission has decided it will not come into force immediately. EU member states insisted that national parliaments should have a say on aspects of the EU-Canada deal that touch on national competences. Even if the EU and Canada sign the treaty in the coming weeks, Ceta will only become a complete and permanent legal document following ratification by at least 38 national and regional parliaments in Europe. Only the backing of national parliaments would trigger the creation of an exclusive trade court to replace the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), the existing system for resolving trade disputes that has existed since the 1960s. This system is written into thousands of investment contracts, including 1,400 involving EU countries. Critics have rung alarm bells about the scope ISDS gives private companies to sue governments. The commission argues that its proposed changes to existing investor courts deepen transparency and end conflicts of interest, as judges would be appointed by governments and not companies, but critics have dismissed the reforms as rebranding. Campaign groups welcomed the Belgian challenge to the investor-state tribunals. \u201cThe use of investment tribunals allows companies to sue governments for lost profits if they introduce laws to protect people or the environment,\u201d said Paul de Clerck of Friends of the Earth Europe. \u201cThese corporate courts have no place in our democracies and we welcome the stance of the dissenting Belgian regions in contending them.\u201d The European commission had no immediate comment on the challenge to the investor court idea it has championed, but a spokesperson said events were unfolding in a good direction. \u201cWhat matters is not when [the Ceta signing] happens but the fact that it happens and it will happen.\u201d Shortly after the compromise was announced, several dozen activists launched a rowdy, but peaceful protest outside the commission headquarters in Brussels. Holding aloft banners reading \u201cStop Ceta\u201d, protesters banged drums, occasionally jeered at passing EU officials and sang songs, including the Les Mis\u00e9rables musical number, Can You Hear the People Sing. The cliffhanger story of the EU-Canada trade treaty is seen as a bad omen for post-Brexit Britain as it seeks a trade agreement with Europe. Britain\u2019s secretary of state for trade, Liam Fox, told MPs on Wednesday that the difficulties over Ceta underscored the importance of the UK signing a trade deal before it leaves the EU. The UK would only face a procedure similar to Ceta, he said, if it failed to conclude a trade agreement before the end of two years of divorce negotiations under the EU\u2019s article 50. \u201cThat sort of procedure would only be undertaken were we to leave the European Union after our article 50 period without any agreement whatsoever and were looking to seek a new FTA [free-trade agreement] from outside,\u201d he said. Some observers think that is a likely prospect, as the article 50 divorce talks are dedicated to unwinding Britain\u2019s EU membership and European leaders will not sign a trade deal before agreeing the divorce settlement. Fox, a prominent leave campaigner, said the experience of Ceta might cause some to think twice before seeking a trade agreement with the EU. \u201cThose who put politics ahead of prosperity might want to think twice,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Debenhams targets BHS customers with new lighting departments", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Debenhams is launching lighting departments in 30 stores this season and aiming to launch 30 more next year as it tries to take control of a market once led by BHS. The department store said it had hired BHS\u2019s lighting buying team since the retailer went bust earlier this year as part of its efforts to boost its homeware department to offset falling clothing sales. Clothing made up less than half of Debenhams sales for the first time in the year to 3 September as unseasonal weather hit sales. In contrast, it has recorded strong growth in beauty products, homeware and in its dining areas. Total sales rose 1.3% to \u00a32.89bn in the year to 3 September as new store openings in the UK and growth online offset a 1.1% decline in sales at established outlets. Pre-tax profits slid 10.4% to \u00a3101.7m as a result of \u00a312.4m of one-off costs relating to job cuts at the group\u2019s head office, bankruptcy proceedings at its Irish chain and an IT update. Sir Ian Cheshire, the chairman of Debenhams, said the group\u2019s performance in a difficult market had been \u201cresilient\u201d and that its new boss, Sergio Bucher, who joined from Amazon this month, would be looking at how to evolve the business into a \u201cdepartment store for the 21st century\u201d. He said clothing sales now accounted for 48% of the group\u2019s total, compared with 50% a year ago. Cheshire said the \u201cpot of cash\u201d that shoppers once spent in BHS would now be distributed elsewhere. But he said the crossover in shoppers at the two chains was less significant than people might think. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the background noise in trading, but its not a straight line that they have shut and we will benefit,\u201d he said. Retailers are scrapping for market share in a tough environment where shoppers appear to be switching from spending on clothing to paying for experiences such as holidays and eating out.

    "webTitle": "UK economy up 0.5% since Brexit vote, Nissan to build new Qashqai in Sunderland \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap, after a very busy few hours. Britain\u2019s economy has defied fears that it would be dragged into an immediate recession following the EU referendum. The first official healthcheck of growth in the last quarter showed that GDP rose by 0.5% between July and September. That\u2019s slower than the 0.7% recorded in April-June but faster than expected. The services sector provided all the expansion, though, with growth of 0.8%. Manufacturing, construction and agriculture all shrank, showing that the UK economy remains unbalanced. Interestingly, film and production provided a major boost to growth. That suggests Britain is benefitting from the new wave of streaming services: Chancellor Philip Hammond welcomed the news, saying it shows the UK economy is resilient as it begins Brexit negotiations. But a series of economists have warned that growth will slow further in 2017. Higher inflation will eat into real wages too. In another boost, Nissan has announced new investment plans for its Sunderland plant. The move guarantees 7,000 jobs, and eases concerns that production could be moved to France. Prime minister Theresa May says it\u2019s a vote of confidence in the UK. But what has the government offered Nissan? Ministers are refusing to give details, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the wider car industry seeking guarantees against damage from Brexit. Labour have warned the government against carving up deals behind closed doors, and instead provide a comprehensive plan for Brexit. And over in Brussels, Wallonia has dropped its opposition to Europe\u2019s new trade deal with Canada. That\u2019s probably all for today, unless anything else major happens. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage, including growth figures for France and the US. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Greg Clarke, the UK business secretary, isn\u2019t revealing what the government has promised to Nissan. According to my colleague Peter Walker, Clarke just waffled through half a dozen questions on the World At One, despite being repeatedly asked if Nissan has been given a deal. The best we got out of Clarke is this nugget: There\u2019s no question of financial compensation over tariffs, because we\u2019ve said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector. But otherwise, it was like a rerun of Just A Minute (but without the humour). Keep an eye on Politics Live for more reaction: Bang on cue.... Britain\u2019s car industry is demanding assurance that it will be protected from any trade tariffs or migration curbs following the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is good news for UK Automotive and jobs, confirming Britain as a leader in automotive production. To secure this position, however, we need government to provide public assurance to investors that our advantages will be maintained \u2013 namely, a competitive business environment, the ability to recruit talent from abroad and the continuation of all the benefits of the single market as we leave the EU.\u201d Carlos Ghosn is clutching a piece of paper, promising help from the government if Britain\u2019s exit from the EU hurts Nissan. So says Reuters, which reports: Britain has given Nissan a written commitment of extra support in the event that Brexit reduces the competitiveness of its Sunderland plant, in return for new production investments by the Japanese carmaker, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. In addition to unconditional investment aid, Britain pledged in a letter to offer further relief if the terms of Britain\u2019s European Union exit ended up harming the plant\u2019s performance, the source said. That explains why Nisson has committed to making the Qashqai and the X-Trail in Sunderland. But surely other carmakers are going to want a similar deal, as Buzzfeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli tweets: Our political reporter Jessica Elgot has full details of Labour\u2019s reaction to Nissan\u2019s announcement: John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, criticised the deal done with Nissan as a \u201cchaotic\u201d strategy. In a speech where he had criticised the government for appearing to prioritise financial services over manufacturing and small businesses, said there had been no public discussion of the deal hashed out for the car maker. \u201cWe know nothing about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they literally going to decide factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more. The first deal looked like it would be protecting financial services, paid for by others. And now with Nissan, other manufacturers are saying what are we going to get? We have to have a comprehensive plan. What we need is more openness and transparency and accountability.\u201d The Unite union are understandably delighted that the 7,000 Nissan jobs in Sunderland are safe, along with thousands more in the supply chain. Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke says it recognises the UK car industry\u2019s world-leading status. \u201cNissan\u2019s decision is a massive vote of confidence in the skills and expertise of a world-class workforce and testament to their hard work which has made the Sunderland plant one of the most productive in the Nissan family. Burke says the government must now secure tariff-free access to the single market, to help all UK car markets. Here\u2019s Labour MP Matthew Pennycook on the Nissan announcement: More news! The deadlock in Belgium that was preventing the EU signing a trade deal with Canada has been broken! Prime Minister Charles Michel has declared that \u201can agreement\u201d has been reached with the French-speaking communities in Wallonia who sensationally blocked the deal last week. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the Eu trade commissioner, says it\u2019s an important breakthrough, that could mean the deal can now be signed. Unfortunately, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has already cancelled his trip to Brussels to sign the deal. (he was due to land today). And he needn\u2019t pack his suitcase just yet. European Council chief Donald Tusk says he won\u2019t be in touch until all the paperwork is definitely ready. Here\u2019s our news story about Nissan\u2019s new commitment to Sunderland: John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, isn\u2019t impressed that Nissan have apparently cut a deal to stay in Sunderland. Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam has the details: Nissan\u2019s surprise announcement came just as McDonnell was giving a speech about the economy, which is rather bad luck for Labour (unless the dark arts of political spin are in play...). Our Politics Live blog has been tracking it though: Prime minister Theresa May says Nissan has given Britain a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d, but she doesn\u2019t reveal what promises she has given the carmaker..... Conservative MP Michael Fabricant is rather pleased by Nissan\u2019s announcement: It\u2019s official! The next Qashqai will indeed be build in Sunderland, despite the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future. Nissan is also pledging to build its next 4x4 X-Trail vehicle there too. And the company also confirms that Theresa May\u2019s government has given a \u2018commitment\u2019 that the plant\u2019s competitiveness won\u2019t be damaged by Brexit. Here\u2019s the official statement: Nissan Motor Company Ltd. today announced, following its Executive Committee meeting, that it will produce the next Qashqai and will add production of the next X-Trail model at its Sunderland, U.K. Plant. Nissan\u2019s decision follows the U.K. government\u2019s commitment to ensure that the Sunderland plant remains competitive. As a result, Nissan will increase its investment in Sunderland, securing and sustaining the jobs of more than 7,000 workers at the plant. \u201cI am pleased to announce that Nissan will continue to invest in Sunderland. Our employees there continue to make the plant a globally competitive powerhouse, producing high-quality, high-value products every day,\u201d said Carlos Ghosn, Chairman and CEO of Nissan. \u201cThe support and assurances of the U.K. government enabled us to decide that the next-generation Qashqai and X-Trail will be produced at Sunderland. I welcome British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s commitment to the automotive industry in Britain and to the development of an overall industrial strategy.\u201d Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant opened in 1986 and has produced almost 9 million cars since. One in three British cars are produced in Sunderland, which is the UK\u2019s largest car plant of all time. In addition, 80% of production from Sunderland is exported to over 130 international markets. More than 2 million Qashqai\u2019s have been built in Sunderland in less than 10 years. In addition to the 7,000 direct employees at Sunderland, the plant supports a further 28,000 British automotive supply chain jobs. To date, Nissan has invested more than \u00a33.7 billion in Sunderland. Sunderland voted decisively to leave the EU back in June, by 61% to 39%. So Brexit voters may feel vindicated by Nissan\u2019s decision not to move Qashqai production abroad. Paul Brand of ITV tweets: Downing Street will be very pleased by Nissan\u2019s move, says City AM editor Christian May. Has Nissan managed to get the UK government to promise compensation, if the EU imposes tax barriers on car imports after Brexit? CEO Carlos Ghosn was pretty clear that he wanted protection from any new tariffs, once Britain leaves the European Union. After meeting Theresa May on October 14, Ghosn said: If there are tax barriers being established on cars, you have to have a commitment for car-makers who export to Europe that there is some kind of compensation. The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack says that Nissan has received \u201csupport and assurances\u201d from Theresa May\u2019s government, encouraging it to build the new Qashqai in Sunderland. The FT\u2019s Peter Campbell predicts an official announcement soon: Reuters are reporting that Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, has decided that it will build its next Qashqai SUV in Sunderland. That would be a significant boost for the region, and one of the first major investment decisions since June. The Nissan plant at Sunderland employs around 7,000 people, and is Britain\u2019s biggest car factory. Last week Nissan\u2019s chief executive Carlos Ghosn met prime minister Theresa May, and warned that his company could stop investing at Sunderland unless it was protected from any adverse impact from the Brexit vote. We\u2019ve called Nissan for comment..... Today\u2019s growth report shows that the \u201cBrexit bogeyman\u201d hasn\u2019t yet been as scary as initially feared, says Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. She writes: Any lingering concerns over an immediate collapse in growth in 2016 have been officially put to bed, with output continuing to grow in the first major assessment of domestic activity post-referendum. Supportive monetary policy has played a part, while the softer pound has kept factory orders ticking along. These, along with robust consumption, will be key levers of growth. But Curtin also predicts a slowdown next year: The quarter on quarter slowdown in the growth rate suggests Brexit uncertainty is having some bite, and it\u2019s likely the ambiguity around the UK\u2019s exit from the EU will take some of the steam out of the long-term growth rate, with anaemic growth likely to become status quo while Article 50 negotiations rumble on. I\u2019ve quickly truffled through today\u2019s GDP report to get some colour on how the UK economy performed 1) Services: The only sector to grow, by a punchy 0.8%. All four sub-sectors expanded (that\u2019s distribution, hotels and restaurants; transport, storage and communication; business services and finance; and government and other services). Growth was particularly strong in the \u201cmotion picture, video and TV programme production, sound recording and music publishing activities, and computer programming industries\u201d, apparent.y 2) Industrial production: It suffered a 0.4% contraction. That\u2019s mainly because manufacturing output shrank by a whole 1%. Energy supply fell by 3.6%, water and waste management dropped by 0.2%, while mining and quarrying increased by 5.2% 3) Construction: Output fell by 1.4%, which is the biggest decline since 2012. That\u2019s partly because construction of new housing fell, for the first time in a year. 4) Agriculture: Philip Hammond has also told the BBC that the UK economy is looking strong, as the EU exit talks loom: TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the government needs to do more to help UK manufacturing (which contracted by 1% after the Brexit vote): \u201cWe can\u2019t yet say what impact Brexit will have on our economy, but these figures show there\u2019s no room for complacency. British manufacturing is still struggling, and now faces real uncertainty following the vote to leave the EU. \u201cThe government must use next month\u2019s Autumn Statement to boost Britain\u2019s jobs and wages. This means investing in infrastructure like roads, rail and homes, and raising the national minimum wage.\u201d Today\u2019s GDP report is an important measure of the health of Britain\u2019s economy after June\u2019s historic referendum. But several economists say the real test of the Brexit vote will come in 2017, not today. Here\u2019s PwC\u2019s Andrew Sentance: Geoffrey Yu, head of UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that growth will keep slowing: Anecdotal evidence supports the view that we\u2019re yet to see any meaningful damage as a result of the Brexit vote, at least in the short-term. \u201cOf course, we should not overlook the lingering sense of uncertainty. Though the economy has fared better than initially feared, we expect that economic growth will slow down relative to the early part of this year. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company World First, says we\u2019ll have a better picture once Theresa May has triggered article 50: \u201cWe have called the UK consumer a hardy beast in the past and in Q3 the beast was back. The services sector singlehandedly drove growth to a 15th consecutive positive quarter and while the \u2018little evidence of a pronounced effect\u2019 from the Brexit vote is being seen yet, we think that it will be as gradually obvious as the year comes to an end. The beast will tire as inflation fires arrows at its increasingly weakening hide.\u201d Thomas Laskey of Aberdeen Asset Management argues that the Bank of England should get some credit for today\u2019s growth report: \u201cThe data shows that the UK economy fared well in the aftermath of the EU referendum. It confirms what most investors thought: that sentiment bounced back after the initial shock of the result. Growth was fairly strong, at least in part because the Bank of England restarted its bond buying programme and the fact that changes to investment plans take time to play out. But he predicts slower growth next year: \u201cThe outlooks for growth is pretty uncertain. Brexit has the potential to be extremely costly to the UK and the country could be poorer as a result. We\u2019ve already seen this reflected in sterling\u2019s dramatic drop. Growth will probably slow as import costs increase and people\u2019s incomes fall as inflation rises. We are not out of the woods yet by any means.\u201d You can see the GDP report online, here: Gross Domestic Product, preliminary estimate: July to Sept 2016 Chancellor Philip Hammond says today\u2019s report shows that the UK economy is resilient, and \u2018well-placed\u2019 to deal with the challenges and opportunities created by the EU referendum. We are moving into a period of negotiations with the EU and we are determined to get the very best deal for households and businesses. The economy will need to adjust to a new relationship with the EU, but we are well-placed to deal with the challenges and take advantage of opportunities ahead.\u201d Anyone remember George Osborne\u2019s plan to rebalance the economy and create a March of the Makers? Five year\u2019s later, Britain is as dependent on service sector growth as ever: Britain\u2019s economy has now grown for 15 quarters in a row, and is 8.2% higher than the pre-economic downturn peak in early 2008. Today\u2019s report shows that Britain has not suffered a Brexit shock, according to Joe Grice, head of the Office for National Statistics. Grice says: There is little evidence of a pronounced effect in the immediate aftermath of the vote\u201d The pound has rallied a little, to $1.225, as traders welcome the GDP report. Britain\u2019s service sector, which makes up three quarters of the economy, is the only part which grew in the last three months. Service sector output grew by 0.8% in July-September. Construction shrank by 1.4% Agriculture shrank bu 0.7% Industrial production shrank by 0.4% And manufacturing (part of production) shrank by 1% At first glance, this report suggests that the UK economy has shrugged off the immediate shock of the EU referendum. It has grown faster than predicted in the gloomier forecasts ahead of June\u2019s vote. Remember, the Treasury said the economy would shrink by 0.1% after a Brexit vote. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.3% during the last quarter. Again, that\u2019s stronger than expected. HERE WE GO! Britain\u2019s economy grew by 0.5% in the three months after the Brexit vote. That\u2019s down from 0.7% in the second quarter of 2016, showing that growth has slowed. But it\u2019s also stronger than the 0.3% which economists has expected. More to follow! The pound has risen back to $1.224... Tension is building, with just four minutes until we learn how the UK economy performed after the EU referendum.... Back in April, the Treasury claimed that the economy would shrink by 0.1% for four quarters in a row, if Britain voted to leave the EU. Today\u2019s GDP report is the first test of that assessment.... [UPDATE: This forecast may have assumed Britain had triggered Article 50 immediately after the referendum]. A flash of good news from Madrid: the Spanish unemployment rate hit its lowest level since 2009 in the last quarter. But it\u2019s still 18.9%, despite a surge in summer hiring to handle the tourist trade. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted a nice graph, showing how uncertainty spiked after the referendum,but has been dropping to less jittery levels since. Today\u2019s Q3 growth report is only \u2018preliminary\u2019, as it\u2019s mainly based on data from July and August. That makes it harder to predict, says Jeremy Cook of World First: Surveys are suggesting a number between 0.1% and 0.4% with consensus estimates looking for a figure of around 0.3% but this is the muddiest figure we will have seen in a while given the collapse in expectations in July and the rebound in August. Manufacturing may be optimistic but services are not sharing in that joy. The pound has dropped by almost half a cent this morning, to $1.2202, as traders await the UK GDP report. Just 45 minutes until we get the UK GDP report for the last quarter! Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi predicts it will get a mixed reception: Although the City consensus is that UK growth fell to 0.3% in the last quarter, some forecasts are plumping for a rosier +0.4%. Ross Finley of Reuters has the details: HSBC are in the camp predicting that UK growth dipped to 0.3% in the last three months. But they aren\u2019t ruling out a higher figure, saying: \u201cThe U.K. economy has held up in Q3, defying expectations of a pronounced uncertainty-driven slowdown following the referendum. Given fairly robust indicators, our forecast is for growth of 0.3% qoq, with risks to the upside.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that the uncertainty over Brexit is bad for the economy. Speaking on Bloomberg, Lagarde says firms want to know whether London-based banks will lose their rights to \u2018passport\u2019 services across the EU single market. Britain\u2019s future trade deals are another question mark, making it harder for companies to invest and create jobs. This uncertainty is \u201cnot healthy\u201d, says Lagarde. But she does welcome the government\u2019s commitment to trigger article 50 by the end of March 2017. One thing we know now is the timetable. So for the next two and a half years nothing changes, but everything is changed. Don\u2019t get too excited if today\u2019s GDP report shows that the economy is still growing, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. She predicts that consumer spending will provide the bulk of the growth in the last quarter, as industry and construction struggles over the summer Industrial production has fallen sharply in recent months; it fell by 0.4% in August. Construction is facing a steeper decline, the latest Office for National Statistics data on construction output has fallen 2% since June. In contrast, the service sector PMI bounced back after a sharp decline in service sector sentiment in July. We expect this pattern to be repeated in the Q3 GDP report. And Brooks also fears that 2017 will be tough, as higher inflation eats into real wages. The Bank of England has slashed its growth forecasts for 2017 to a mere 0.8%, compared with 2.2% for 2016. Consultancy firm PWC is forecasting a gloomier outcome at 0.6% for 2017. The biggest risk for UK growth is a sharp slowdown in business investment that could become more pronounced in the coming months, once the UK government has triggered Article 50. If the UK looks set to lose its access to the single market, then we may see the consumer show signs of stress, which could knock the UK economy seriously off course, and potentially plunge us into recession. Today\u2019s GDP figures are the most eagerly awaited since the British economy returned to growth four years ago. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, says. \u201cThis is an extremely high stakes report \u2013 the British economy appears to have been surprisingly resilient to the Brexit upset. \u201cTo be clear, some economic damage is still expected, if not of a recession-inducing magnitude.\u201d That\u2019s via Bloomberg, who reckon the report will \u201cswing the mood of consumers and provide a tool for politicians pushing their view on how tough to be when it comes to actually removing the U.K. from the EU\u201d. Good morning. We\u2019re about to find out how well, or badly, Britain\u2019s economy fared in the immediate aftermath of June\u2019s historic vote to quit the European Union. At 9.30am, the Office for National Statistics will whip the official growth figures for the third quarter of this year out of its hat. And we\u2019re expecting to learn that the economy slowed sharply in the July to September quarter. But, GDP probably didn\u2019t go into reverse, despite fears that a Brexit vote would trigger an immediate recession. Economists predict that the quarterly growth rate probably slowed to around 0.3%, or perhaps 0.4%, down from a healthier 0.7% in the April-June quarter. That would mean that Britain\u2019s economy has been growing for 15th consecutive quarters. The breakdown of the GDP report will also show how the service sector, manufacturers and construction firms all fared during the last quarter. The figures are likely to shift the pound, and move the stock markets, especially if growth is markedly stronger or weaker than the City expects. Other data released since June has suggested that the economy has taken the uncertainty pretty well, with the unemployment rate sticking at 4.9% and consumer spending resilient. As RBC Capital Markets put it: It does seem that the impact of the referendum won\u2019t have been as immediate as we and many others had initially expected. But, the true impact of Brexit will be seen over years, of course, not months, as Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit tweets: GDP is obviously the main event. But we\u2019ll also keep an eye on financial results from Barclays and Deutsche Bank, plus cider maker C&amp;C, retailer Debenhams and telecoms group BT.",

      "bodyText": "Nissan will build the next Qashqai and X-Trail models at its Sunderland factory, safeguarding more than 7,000 jobs, in the first major investment decision in the car industry since the Brexit vote. Colin Lawther, a senior official for the carmaker, said there were ambitions to turn the factory into a \u201csuper plant\u201d producing 600,000 cars a year and protecting the jobs of the local workforce and the thousands more who support the production across the UK. The prime minister hailed the decision as a vote of confidence in Britain. \u201cIt is a recognition that the government is committed to creating and supporting the right conditions for the automotive industry so it continues to grow \u2013 now and in the future,\u201d said Theresa May. The announcement came as new figures showed the economy fared far better than expected in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. In the first official verdict on how the economy has performed since Britain voted to leave the EU, the Office for National Statistics said GDP grew by 0.5% in the third quarter. This was down from 0.7% in the previous three months but well ahead of City forecasts of 0.3%. Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, has been lobbying May\u2019s government for guarantees after the 23 June referendum. He said on Thursday that government support and assurances had led to the decision to manufacture the Qashqai and X-Trail SUV models in Sunderland. The X-Trail is an unexpected addition. Ghosn said: \u201cOur employees there continue to make the plant a globally competitive powerhouse, producing high-quality, high-value products every day.\u201d He had previously said future investment in Britain\u2019s biggest car factory depended on a guarantee of compensation if the UK struck a deal with European allies that led to tariffs on car exports. Lawther, Nissan\u2019s European senior vice president for manufacturing, purchasing, and supply chain management, said that the decision had been made after daily conversations with the government since the referendum. \u201cIt comes down to trust at the end of the day,\u201d Lawther said. \u201cWe are confident the government is taking sufficient measures to make sure the whole of the automative industry will be competitive at the end of the process\u201d. He said there had been \u201cno financial package outside the normal, in the public domain request, for grant support\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve ended up in a rosy pink scenario today,\u201d said Lawther, who said production lines had been stopped at 11am to inform staff. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, criticised the deal done as a \u201cchaotic\u201d strategy. In a speech where he had criticised the government for appearing to prioritise financial services over manufacturing and small businesses, McDonnell said there had been no public discussion of the deal hashed out for the carmaker. \u201cWe know nothing about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they literally going to decide factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment. \u201cWe are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more. \u201cThe first deal looked like it would be protecting financial services, paid for by others. And now with Nissan, other manufacturers are saying what are we going to get? We have to have a comprehensive plan. What we need is more openness and transparency and accountability.\u201d Labour\u2019s mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is scheduled to call on the government to prioritise the City\u2019s EU passporting rights at a speech at the City of London Corporation\u2019s annual dinner on Thursday night. McDonnell said he was also determined to protect financial services but would not prioritise a \u201cbankers\u2019 Brexit\u201d over other industries. \u201cIt sends out messages to the rest of our economy that special deals are being cooked up. We will fight for every job in financial services sector, but it cannot be done in a chaotic way.\u201d Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union, called on the government to support other carmakers to ensure they continue to invest in the UK. Its assistant general secretary, Tony Burke, said: \u201cNissan\u2019s decision is a massive vote of confidence in the skills and expertise of a world-class workforce and testament to their hard work which has made the Sunderland plant one of the most productive in the Nissan family. \u201cA source for decent jobs, skills and innovation, it is vital that the government supports the car industry and secures tariff-free access to the single market to ensure other manufacturers follow Nissan\u2019s lead and invest in the UK car industry.\u201d Mike Hawes, who heads the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, also called for more guarantees from the government. \u201cWe need government to provide public assurance to investors that our advantages will be maintained \u2013 namely, a competitive business environment, the ability to recruit talent from abroad and the continuation of all the benefits of the single market as we leave the EU.\u201d Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant, which opened in 1986, employs more than 7,000 people, with a further 28,000 supply-chain jobs depending on the factory, mostly in the north-east. It produces half a million cars a year under the Juke, Qashqai and Leaf brands. One in three British cars are manufactured in Sunderland, where Nissan has invested more than \u00a33.7bn to date. \u201cOur dream is a 600,00 car super plant, there\u2019s not many of those in the world,\u201d said Lawther. Rumours have swirled that the discussions have also included the possibility of Nissan generating more power locally, but Lawther said \u201cwe are not talking about additional generation on site\u201d beyond the 10 wind turbines already in place. Production, he said, would continue beyond the three years it could take for Britain to leave the EU. Lawther said: \u201cThe government has said it is working towards a competitive environment, targeting towards free trade.\u201d The Qashqai and Juke were designed at Nissan\u2019s Paddington design centre in London. It also has an engineering centre in Cranfield, Bedfordshire, and a sales and marketing team in Maple Cross, Hertfordshire. Also on Thursday, Nissan reported an 11% rise in global production in September to 485,154 cars \u2013 a record for the month. In the UK, it ramped up production by 6.6% to 50,133 cars, another record.",

This was down from 0.7% in the previous three months but well ahead of City forecasts of 0.3%.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/nissan-chief-executive-carlos-ghosn-meets-theresa-may-brexit-talks\">Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, has been lobbying May\u2019s</a> government for guarantees after the 23 June referendum. He said on Thursday that government support and assurances had led to the decision to manufacture the Qashqai and X-Trail SUV models in Sunderland. The X-Trail is an unexpected addition.<br></p> <p>Ghosn said: \u201cOur employees there continue to make the plant a globally competitive powerhouse, producing high-quality, high-value products every day.\u201d</p> <p>He had previously said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\">future investment in Britain\u2019s biggest car factory depended on a guarantee of compensation</a> if the UK struck a deal with European allies that led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/nissan-sunderland-trade-tariffs-job-losses-brexit-julie-elliott-theresa-may\">tariffs on car exports</a>.</p> <p>Lawther, Nissan\u2019s European senior vice president for manufacturing, purchasing, and supply chain management, said that the decision had been made after daily conversations with the government since the referendum.</p> <p>\u201cIt comes down to trust at the end of the day,\u201d Lawther said. \u201cWe are confident the government is taking sufficient measures to make sure the whole of the automative industry will be competitive at the end of the process\u201d. </p> <p>He said there had been \u201cno financial package outside the normal, in the public domain request, for grant support\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve ended up in a rosy pink scenario today,\u201d said Lawther, who said production lines had been stopped at 11am to inform staff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-27T13:57:03/embed.html\" data-alt=\"nissan graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-27T13:57:03/embed.html\">nissan graph</a> </figure>  <p>John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, criticised the deal done as a \u201cchaotic\u201d strategy. In a speech where he had criticised the government for appearing to prioritise financial services over manufacturing and small businesses, McDonnell said there had been no public discussion of the deal hashed out for the carmaker. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe know nothing about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they literally going to decide factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe first deal looked like it would be protecting financial services, paid for by others. And now with Nissan, other manufacturers are saying what are we going to get? We have to have a comprehensive plan. What we need is more openness and transparency and accountability.\u201d<br></p> <p>Labour\u2019s mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is scheduled to call on the government to prioritise the City\u2019s EU passporting rights at a speech at the City of London Corporation\u2019s annual dinner on Thursday night.<br></p> <p>McDonnell said he was also determined to protect financial services but would not prioritise a \u201cbankers\u2019 Brexit\u201d over other industries. \u201cIt sends out messages to the rest of our economy that special deals are being cooked up. We will fight for every job in financial services sector, but it cannot be done in a chaotic way.\u201d<br></p> <p>Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union, called on the government to support other carmakers to ensure they continue to invest in the UK. Its assistant general secretary, Tony Burke, said: \u201cNissan\u2019s decision is a massive vote of confidence in the skills and expertise of a world-class workforce and testament to their hard work which has made the Sunderland plant one of the most productive in the Nissan family.<br></p> <p>\u201cA source for decent jobs, skills and innovation, it is vital that the government supports the car industry and secures tariff-free access to the single market to ensure other manufacturers follow Nissan\u2019s lead and invest in the UK car industry.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-27T15:18:08/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Nissan graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2016-10-27T15:18:08/embed.html\">Nissan graph</a> </figure>  <p>Mike Hawes, who heads the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, also called for more guarantees from the government. \u201cWe need government to provide public assurance to investors that our advantages will be maintained \u2013 namely, a competitive business environment, the ability to recruit talent from abroad and the continuation of all the benefits of the single market as we leave the EU.\u201d</p> <p>Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant, which opened in 1986, employs more than 7,000 people, with a further 28,000 supply-chain jobs depending on the factory, mostly in the north-east. </p> <p>It produces half a million cars a year under the Juke, Qashqai and Leaf brands. One in three British cars are manufactured in Sunderland, where Nissan has invested more than \u00a33.7bn to date.</p> <p>\u201cOur dream is a 600,00 car super plant, there\u2019s not many of those in the world,\u201d said Lawther.</p> <p>Rumours have swirled that the discussions have also included the possibility of Nissan generating more power locally, but Lawther said \u201cwe are not talking about additional generation on site\u201d beyond the 10 wind turbines already in place.</p> <p>Production, he said, would continue beyond the three years it could take for Britain to leave the EU. </p> <p>Lawther said: \u201cThe government has said it is working towards a competitive environment, targeting towards free trade.\u201d</p> <p>The Qashqai and Juke were designed at Nissan\u2019s Paddington design centre in London. It also has an engineering centre in Cranfield, Bedfordshire, and a sales and marketing team in Maple Cross, Hertfordshire.</p> <p>Also on Thursday, Nissan reported an 11% rise in global production in September to 485,154 cars \u2013 a record for the month. In the UK, it ramped up production by 6.6% to 50,133 cars, another record.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tata Sons has hit back at axed chairman Cyrus Mistry in an escalating war of words that pits two of India\u2019s most powerful business dynasties against each other. Tata, a conglomerate whose UK assets include Jaguar Land Rover and the struggling Port Talbot steelworks, was responding to a leaked letter from Mistry criticising the board\u2019s decision to oust him. In a lengthy statement, Tata said it was \u201cbeneath the dignity of Tata Sons to engage in a public spat with regard to the several unfounded allegations appearing in his leaked confidential statement\u201d. It went on to outline a \u201cgrowing trust deficit\u201d between the rest of the board and Mistry, describing his behaviour as \u201cunforgivable\u201d. \u201cIt is a matter of deep regret that a communication marked confidential to Tata Sons board members has been made public in an unseemly and undignified manner,\u201d the firm said. \u201cThe correspondence makes unsubstantiated claims and malicious allegations, casting aspersions on the Tata group, the Tata Sons board and several Tata companies and some respected individuals.\u201d Mistry claimed in his letter that the firm was suffering from a \u201ctotal lack of corporate governance\u201d, was bent on unprofitable expansion and was also facing writedowns of up to $18bn (\u00a315bn). This included criticism of predecessor and Tata family scion Ratan Tata, who he claimed had supported bad business decisions, including pursuing a partnership with Air Asia, against Mistry\u2019s advice. \u201cIt is unfortunate that it is only on his removal that allegations and misrepresentation of facts are being made about business decisions that the former chairman was party to for over a decade in different capacities,\u201d Tata continued. \u201cThe record, as and when made public, will prove things to the contrary.\u201d The conflict is set to drive a wedge between two of India\u2019s most powerful business families, particularly given that the Mistry family owns an 18.4% stake in Tata Sons, the largest shareholding not owned by the Tata family. Tata sought to defend the conduct of its board members in their decision to oust Mistry, which was announced on Monday. \u201cThis [the board] is not a group of people who one would expect to act without exercising proper judgment in the best interests of the entities they sit on the boards of.\u201d Tata said Mistry had \u201coverwhelmingly lost the confidence of the members of the board\u201d for several reasons. These included \u201cconcerns on certain business issues\u201d, the company said, adding that \u201ctrustees of the Tata trusts were increasingly getting concerned with the growing trust deficit with Mr Mistry, but these were not being addressed\u201d. \u201cIt is unforgivable that Mr Mistry has attempted to besmirch the image of the group in the eyes of the employees.\u201d Tata said in its public statement it did not want to engage in a high-profile row but justified its lengthy rebuttal of Mistry\u2019s criticisms. \u201cThese allegations are not based on facts or the true state of affairs. It is convenient to put selective information in the public domain to defend one\u2019s point of view.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A dark cloud of anxiety lifted over Sunderland with the news that Nissan would build two new models at its cathedral of car manufacturing. The Japanese car company\u2019s threat that it could quit the region over Brexit had, like the referendum itself, left an open wound in Sunderland. Outside the Tesco Extra behind the Stadium of Light, shoppers greeted the news with joy, relief and a dash of scepticism. \u201cI think there\u2019s been some subsidies or guarantees from the government, but it\u2019s fantastic news for the area,\u201d said Paul Lancaster. \u201cIt\u2019s what it needs, because without Nissan the area would have nothing. It would die.\u201d His wife, Sandra, described the news as a \u201cboost of confidence\u201d for the region. A remain voter, Sandra said she was shocked by the scale of the leave vote in Sunderland, given Nissan\u2019s importance. \u201cIt was a ridiculous vote. I was dismayed, disgusted,\u201d she said. Few of the city\u2019s politicians, voters or business leaders truly believed Nissan\u2019s threat that it could leave if it did not receive urgent guarantees from Theresa May. After all, it is the most efficient car factory in Europe, producing 115 cars an hour \u2013 half a million a year \u2013 and is the home of Qashqais, Jukes, Notes, Leafs, Infiniti Q30s and now the new X-Trail. Uprooting those finely tuned production lines to Spain or Russia, where it has other factories, was almost unthinkable. \u201cIt is too big to leave,\u201d was a common view on the doorstep. Nevertheless, the possibility of Nissan halting investment in the Washington plant, where it employs 7,000 workers and supports 27,000 more in the supply chain, was enough to give some city leaders sleepless nights. \u201cIt had the potential to put the city back into the stone ages,\u201d said one politician, who declined to talk on the record. Political leaders feared that, if Nissan was seen to be preparing an exit strategy, many big firms would be put off moving to the sprawling new international advanced manufacturing park (IAMP) being built to the north of the firm\u2019s plant. That, in turn, would deal a major blow to the \u00a3117m New Wear crossing, designed to better connect Nissan and manufacturing firms to Sunderland\u2019s port, once home to the world\u2019s biggest shipbuilding firms. The knock-on economic effect for the port could also have been significant. One politician, who declined to talk on the record, spelled out an apocalyptic vision: \u201cIf Nissan is in the state of withdrawal, how many people are going to sign up to be next to a big, empty factory where Nissan once stood? You would be counting more tumbleweed than jobs.\u201d Nissan, the biggest private-sector employer in the north-east, is used to getting what it wants. The RAF base at Catterick, North Yorkshire, was once called upon to rescue a shipment of essential components from a ship that was unable to dock during a huge storm in the North Sea. After one phone call from Nissan bosses, a rescue helicopter was on its way. The car giant paid for the fuel. Now Nissan is understood to be seeking to build its own gasification plant to provide low-cost energy at the Washington site, a development that would deepen its roots in the north-east. Paul Watson, the leader of Sunderland city council, said he was seeking to smooth the way for the deal, which would be \u201ccrucial\u201d for the car plant\u2019s future. Watson admitted he had been concerned about the fate of the plant, but said he believed that, \u201cgiven a level playing field\u201d, Nissan would stay put. \u201cOver the past 30 years, when we\u2019ve got stuck into reinventing the economy and the region, recently we\u2019ve grown more confident in ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cNissan and other firms are here because it\u2019s good for them to be here.\u201d Julie Elliott, the Labour MP for Sunderland Central, was more circumspect. \u201cI wholeheartedly welcome the announcement from Nissan that two new vehicles will be built at the Sunderland plant, but it\u2019s only half a sigh of relief for the city,\u201d she said. Tens of thousands of jobs in Sunderland, and more than 100,000 in the north east, remain at risk from the possible introduction of trade tariffs, Elliott warned. Even if Nissan was covered by a deal protecting Britain\u2019s booming motor industry, many companies in its supply chain would still be vulnerable: \u201cThere are many, many companies in Sunderland and beyond that export massively and import raw material from Europe who are not covered by any sectoral deal.\u201d Back outside Tesco, May Robson, a recently retired office manager, said she didn\u2019t vote in the referendum due to health problems, but that Nissan\u2019s \u201cpolitical threat\u201d would not have swayed her either way. \u201cTo me, Nissan saying they would leave was a kneejerk reaction. It felt like a political threat. I\u2019m pleased today, because we need employment and we would lose far too much without Nissan,\u201d she said. But the city is far bigger than one company, Robson said, and could recover as it did from the closure of the coalmines and shipyards in decades past. \u201cWe should leave the EU. I\u2019m old and I know from the days before the common market that we did OK, we did fantastic, and we can go back to that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mines, sadly, had to go. Shipbuilding we didn\u2019t need as much. We\u2019ve got to move with the times and now we\u2019ve got technology. What we lost before we can gain in other ways.\u201d Mike Jenning, a leave voter, said he thought Nissan leaving was a \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d, but that had not been a factor in his vote. \u201cNissan didn\u2019t affect my vote, because I\u2019ve never been a believer in the EU anyway. Even the first vote [in 1975], I didn\u2019t want to join,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, longer term, if Nissan wasn\u2019t getting the deals to the European market, the efficiency of the plant becomes irrelevant. But I\u2019m pleased for the area. It\u2019s a good advert for the workforce.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The taxpayer stake in Lloyds Banking Group has fallen below 9% after Philip Hammond sanctioned a further sale even though the shares are trading below the average paid by the taxpayer during the 2008 bailout. The reduction was announced to the market the day after the bank said it was taking another \u00a31bn charge for payment protection insurance misselling which knocked its profit in the third quarter of the year. The chancellor announced this month that he was abandoning his predecessor\u2019s plan to offer the public cut-price shares in Lloyds and would instead sell the remaining stake on the stock market at prices below the 73.6p average price taxpayers paid for their stake. Lloyds shares were trading at 56p on Thursday ,prmomg, well below that average price, although the Treasury argues that it will not make a loss on the overall sale because of the profit made on selling off shares earlier. At its peak, the taxpayer stake stood at 43% when \u00a320bn was pumped into the bank. Some \u00a317bn has been received by the exchequer. Hammond said: \u201cSelling our shares in Lloyds and making sure that we get back all the cash taxpayers injected into it during the financial crisis is one of my top priorities as chancellor.\u201d The decision to abandon the retail offering to the public \u2013 a key pledge made by George Osborne \u2013 has infuriated some of the brokers hoping to handle the sale. Hargreaves Lansdown has set up a petition asking the government to reconsider the decision. \u201cRather than engage with working taxpayers willing to invest in our economy, the government has favoured city institutions,\u201d said Ian Gorham, chief executive of Hargreaves Lansdown. The disposal of the stake began in September 2013 when \u00a33.2bn of shares were sold at 75p to institutional investors. In March 2014, a further \u00a34.2bn tranche was sold at 75.5p and in December 2014 the chancellor began to dribble shares into the market as long as the level was above 73.6p.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy performed far better than expected in after the Brexit vote, with GDP growth falling to 0.5% from 0.7% in the previous quarter. The strong showing, which defied City forecasts that growth would more than halve to 0.3%, came after the dominant services sector expanded at a faster rate in the past three months than during the period before the referendum vote. But the figures were marred by a contraction in agriculture, construction and manufacturing that prompted business groups to urge the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to use the autumn statement next month to support measures that boost investment and productivity. The data from the Office for National Statistics covers the three months to the end of September and is the first official verdict on how the economy has performed since Britain voted to leave the European Union. The main boost to services came from transport, storage and communication, which grew at its fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2009, rising 2.2% over the period in contrast to 0.6% in the second quarter. The ONS said higher output in the film, music and TV sectors was the main driver, indicating that Britain\u2019s creative industries sailed through the uncertainty surrounding the referendum unscathed. The expansion of the services sector helped to offset the steepest fall in construction since the third quarter of 2012, with a slide in new housebuilding dragging the entire building industry down 1.4% between July and September. Manufacturing dropped by 1% in the third quarter, while production fell 0.4% and agriculture slipped by 0.7%. The figures rule out the prospect of a technical recession \u2013 defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 in the second half of the year that was predicted by many economists before the referendum vote. The 0.5% rise also beat the latest forecasts from Bank of England policymakers, who were predicting at the time of the August inflation report that third quarter growth would come in at 0.1%. Threadneedle Street is likely to use the data as a reason to delay any further stimulus to the economy until next year, placing further pressure on the Treasury to support industry. Hammond said the figures demonstrated the resilience of the UK economy, which was \u201cwell-placed\u201d to deal with the challenges and opportunities created by the EU referendum. \u201cWe are moving into a period of negotiations with the EU and we are determined to get the very best deal for households and businesses. The economy will need to adjust to a new relationship with the EU, but we are well-placed to deal with the challenges and take advantage of opportunities ahead.\u201d Challenging the chancellor\u2019s assessment, several City analysts warned the Brexit bounce would prove temporary. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg bank, said the resilient post-referendum performance \u201cdoes not say anything about the UK\u2019s ability to perform outside of the EU\u201d. He said: \u201cThe good quarter of growth merely reflects the momentum heading into the vote and the healthy underlying fundamentals after some three years of good growth. The data does not alter our long-term view that Brexit will lower UK trend growth, to around 1.8% from 2.2% per year, via less trade, migration and investment with its major market, the EU.\u201d Business groups also warned the chancellor that industry remained vulnerable to uncertainty after the Brexit vote, and he should open his cheque book to prevent a longer term slump in output. Mike Spicer, director of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cAlthough many manufacturers saw a bounce this summer, in part from the lower exchange rate, this was not enough to prevent a contraction in industrial output overall. Many have found themselves on the wrong side of currency movements \u2013 facing increased costs for imported components.\u201d For this reason \u201cboosting business confidence must be a key task for government in the months ahead\u201d, he said. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the government needed to do more to help UK manufacturing. \u201cWe can\u2019t yet say what impact Brexit will have on our economy, but these figures show there\u2019s no room for complacency. British manufacturing is still struggling, and now faces real uncertainty following the vote to leave the EU. \u201cThe government must use next month\u2019s autumn statement to boost Britain\u2019s jobs and wages. This means investing in infrastructure like roads, rail and homes, and raising the national minimum wage.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy has been growing for 15 consecutive quarters. The relative resilience of the UK economy since the Brexit vote on 23 June has largely been attributed to a willingness among consumers to keep spending, as well as strength in the services sector. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that Britain will be the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial countries in 2016, with growth of 1.8%. The Washington-based fund accepted that its warning of a post-Brexit-vote financial crash had proved too pessimistic.",

The company, which said the non-cash charge would not affect full-year figures, appointed external advisers to assist with a full investigation into BT Italia. BT said its initial internal inquiry found \u201ccertain historical accounting errors\u201d and it had \u201creassessed certain areas of management judgment\u201d.

BT Sport said its average audience figures increased 1%, excluding its free showcase channel and digital channels, despite the competition from the Rio Olympics. \u201cWe are benefiting from our new Saturday early evening slot for Premier League matches, with better viewing figures.\u201d It added 63,000 TV customers in the three months to the end of September, taking its total TV base to 1.7 million. Total revenues for the telecoms group grew 35% year-on-year to \u00a36bn in the three months to the end of September. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of EE, which BT completed the \u00a312.5bn acquisition of in January after an investigation by the competition regulator, revenues were up 1.1%. Pre-tax profits, also unadjusted, rose 5% year-on-year in the quarter to \u00a3671m. On an adjusted basis pre-tax profits rose 24% to \u00a3873m in the quarter. The company added 76,000 retail broadband customers in the quarter, 65% of the industry\u2019s total new customers that quarter, taking its total base to 4.5 million. Of those, 49% are using fibre. On BT\u2019s wrangle with Ofcom over the regulator\u2019s push for Openreach to be overhauled, the chief executive of BT, Gavin Patterson, said: \u201cOfcom\u2019s consultation on the digital communications review closed earlier this month. We\u2019ve submitted our response and will continue to engage with Ofcom to reach the best outcome for the UK.\u201d Earlier this year, BT said EU regulations stated that it could not be \u201cforced\u201d to break up with Openreach.

    "webTitle": "Deutsche Bank swings to profit despite anxiety over mis-selling scandal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank surprised investors by reporting a profit for the third quarter of the year, as its chief executive admitted the huge settlement it faces from American authorities for a decade-old mis-selling scandal was having \u201can unsettling effect\u201d. Germany\u2019s biggest bank has been rocked by reports that the US Department of Justice might demand as much as $14bn to settle the long-running dispute over the way it sold residential mortgage backed securities before the 2008 banking crisis. Announcing profits of \u20ac619m, the chief executive, John Cryan, said: \u201cThe results for the quarter demonstrate well the strengths of our operating businesses and the outstanding work of our people. We continued to make good progress on restructuring the bank. \u201cHowever, in the past several weeks these positive developments were overshadowed by the attention around our negotiations concerning the residential mortgage backed securities matter in the United States. This had an unsettling effect. The bank is working hard on achieving a resolution of this issue as soon as possible.\u201d He warned staff in a memo that \u201cthe situation will remain tough for some time to come\u201d. Revenues were depressed and there were some outflows, the bank acknowledged, as a result of anxiety about its ability to pay the penalty. The bank\u2019s liquid assets \u2013 ones it can use quickly to pay demands for cash \u2013 fell \u20ac23bn to \u20ac200bn between the end of June and the end of September. But Marcus Schenck, the finance director, said this had now stabilised. Cryan has made clear that Deutsche \u2013 which employs around 8,000 people in the UK \u2013 does not expect the final bill to be as high as $14bn and has dismissed reports that the bank has called on the German government for help. Deutsche\u2019s shares plunged last month to levels they last traded at in the 1980s, slipping through \u20ac10, and the bank acknowledged that the anxiety about the DoJ settlement had knocked its business. On Thursday its shares were trading at around \u20ac13. A year ago they were at \u20ac27. Cryan told analysts that reaching a deal with the DoJ and handling other litigation was his \u201ctop priority\u201d but the timing is not under his control. He admitted the ongoing talks were creating uncertainty: \u201cUncertainty that affects the market\u2019s view of Deutsche Bank as an investment, uncertainty that affected some clients\u2019 view of Deutsche Bank as a counterparty and uncertainty that even affects our financial planning and strategy execution.\u201d Cryan, a Briton who has been at the helm of Germany\u2019s biggest bank since last year, said he was personally spending time with clients and attempting to \u201cdispel some of the more lurid myths\u201d about the bank. \u201cWe know that when our name is in the headlines for the wrong reasons, our phone doesn\u2019t ring as frequently,\u201d said Cryan, who dismissed suggestions that investors were questioning his strategy for the bank. The sale of Postbank \u2013 Deutsche\u2019s high street operation \u2013 would not be rushed, he said, until an attractive offer was received. Cryan said he wanted to keep the asset management arm, which is currently being reviewed and is often regarded as a possible business for Deutsche to sell, as an integral part of the group. The profits were a dramatic improvement on the same period last year when Deutsche made a \u20ac6bn loss. For the nine-month period, a loss of \u20ac3bn has been reversed to a \u20ac1.6bn profit. Schenck said a decision had not been made on how bonuses would be paid to staff, but indicated that less would be paid out in cash and more in shares. \u201cIn what form variable compensation will be paid is not yet decided. Given the situation of the bank and the profitability situation \u2026 having more tied towards the share price development in the future seems to make sense,\u201d said Schenck.",

We continued to make good progress on restructuring the bank.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, in the past several weeks these positive developments were overshadowed by the attention around our negotiations concerning the residential mortgage backed securities matter in the United States. This had an unsettling effect. The bank is working hard on achieving a resolution of this issue as soon as possible.\u201d <br></p> <p>He warned <a href=\"https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2016/ghp/a-message-from-john-cryan-on-deutsche-bank-s-third-quarter-financial-results-2016-en-11734.htm\">staff in a memo</a> that \u201cthe situation will remain tough for some time to come\u201d.</p> <p>Revenues were depressed and there were some outflows, the bank acknowledged, as a result of anxiety about its ability to pay the penalty. The bank\u2019s liquid assets \u2013 ones it can use quickly to pay demands for cash \u2013 fell \u20ac23bn to \u20ac200bn between the end of June and the end of September. But Marcus Schenck, the finance director, said this had now stabilised.</p> <p>Cryan has made clear that Deutsche \u2013 which employs around 8,000 people in the UK \u2013 does not expect the final bill to be as high as $14bn and has dismissed reports that the bank has called on the German government for help.</p> <p>Deutsche\u2019s shares plunged last month to levels they last traded at in the 1980s, slipping through \u20ac10, and the bank acknowledged that the anxiety about the DoJ settlement had knocked its business. On Thursday its shares were trading at around \u20ac13.

      "bodyText": "The banking software firm Misys has abandoned plans for a return to the stock market, ditching what could have been the biggest flotation in London this year. Misys had already slashed the value of its mooted \u00a34.5bn float by \u00a31bn last week due to market nerves. The company said on Thursday: \u201cDespite encouraging institutional support Misys Group Limited has decided not to proceed with its potential initial public offering at the current time due to market conditions.\u201d The news came as the boss of O2\u2019s Spanish owner Telefonica cast doubt on the UK mobile firm\u2019s planned \u00a310bn IPO. Mark Evans said the company was \u201cprepared but not committed\u201d to the float and that it would decide next year, depending on market conditions and the state of the UK economy. As possibility of hard Brexit has increased since last month\u2019s Conservative party conference, sending the pound tumbling, investors have become more concerned about the outlook for UK companies. Sterling has lost 18% of its value since the referendum in June. Several companies have cancelled or postponed IPOs, including the fitness chain Pure Gym, vehicle part-maker TI Fluid Systems, and the energy provider First Utility. Biffa, the waste management company, recently cut the price of its flotation after failing to get enough investor support. Misys was delisted four years ago when it was bought by the US private equity firm Vista, which merged Misys with Turaz, previously a software division of Thomson Reuters. When it unveiled its IPO plans three weeks ago, chief executive Nadeem Syed brushed off the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote. He insisted it was right time for the business to return to the stock market, because of the sweeping regulatory changes facing its banking and financial services customers. The firm says it is cheaper for banks to use its software than to develop their own technology. The London-based company had planned to use the \u00a3500m it expected to raise from the float to pay debts. Misys was founded in 1979 as a computer systems supplier to UK insurance brokers and debuted on the London Stock Exchange in 1990.",

In a joint statement with Rinehart, S Kidman and Co chairman John Crosby said his fellow directors would recommend shareholders accept the offer from the mining billionaire\u2019s vehicle, Australian Outback Beef. Rinehart, whose initial bid was $21m lower, would own two-thirds of Australian Outback Beef with Shanghai Cred owning the remaining third if the bid was successful. Rinehart said that her principal company, Hancock Prospecting, would buy Kidman if the bid was knocked back by Australia\u2019s Foreign Investment Review Board (Firb) or the People\u2019s Republic of China approval processes. \u201cI stand behind the bid and should FIRB or PRC approvals not be achieved, then Hancock will proceed with the acquisition on a 100% basis,\u201d Rinehart said. \u201cI hope this provides shareholders with significant comfort and that when they consider the offer they can do so in the knowledge that there is no FIRB or PRC execution risk, and further that we have the money to invest to properly maintain the stations and their hard-working staff.\u201d Crosby, who \u201cacknowledged the strong credentials of the company led by Mrs Rinehart\u201d, said: \u201cUnder the ... offer the core Kidman business will remain intact and the Kidman staff and legacy will be looked after,\u201d Mr. Crosby said. Although Australian Outback Beef was already the preferred bidder, Kidman received a late outside offer from the BBHO consortium, made up of four Australian graziers, Sterling Buntine, Tom Brinkworth, Malcolm Harris and Viv Oldfield. BBHO had offered $386m including the Anna Creek station, which has an area up to 26,000 hectares adjacent to the Woomera weapons testing range. BBHO was supported by federal independent MP Bob Katter and senator Nick Xenophon, both of whom attended the BBHO announcement in federal parliament. Kidman\u2019s assets comprise 101,411 sq km \u2013 2.5% of Australia\u2019s agricultural land or 1.3% of its land mass, stretching across Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. The sale of the Kidman properties has been in train for 18 months and the board has previously signalled it wanted the land held together. Earlier this week, Buntine said he and fellow buyers would divide most of the Kidman properties between them but maintain the S Kidman brand for marketing across their own herds of cattle as well as the 185,000 Kidman herd. In April the treasurer, Scott Morrison, blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co to a majority Chinese-owned consortium because it could have been contrary to the \u201cnational interest\u201d. It is understood under both buyers, Anna Creek station would be sold off. Until the shareholders accept the offer, outside bidders are still free to compete.",
