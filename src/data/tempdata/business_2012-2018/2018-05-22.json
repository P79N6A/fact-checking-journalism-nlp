      "bodyText": "The Dow Jones stock index dropped 200 points on Tuesday after Donald Trump said he was not satisfied with US-China trade talks and cast doubt on whether a summit with North Korea, scheduled for 12 Jun in Singapore, will in fact take place. The losses, which came after a 300-point gain a day earlier on optimism that a trade war had been at least temporarily averted, came amid growing signs of discord within the US negotiating team. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 178.88 points to close at 24,834.41. The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.3% to 2,724.44. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.2% to close at 7,378.46. At a White House meeting with South Korean president Moon Jae-in, Trump was asked if he was pleased with the China trade talks. \u201cNo, not really,\u201d he remarked. Though, he added, \u201cthey\u2019re a start\u201d. Trump\u2019s comments came as new reports pointed to growing divisions between the administration\u2019s free-trade advocates, including treasury secretary and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin and chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, and protectionist hardliners led by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. The divisions are now publicly surfacing as outright contradictions in official statements and well-informed leaks, sometimes made almost contemporaneously. On Monday, the president denied that US trade negotiators had made a deal with China over ZTE Corp, the controversial Chinese telecoms maker that has admitted to violating American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. \u201cThere is no deal,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments are only the latest sign of poor coordination, if not outright discord, within the US negotiating positions in the Chinese trade dispute. On Tuesday, Mnuchin told a Senate panel that US tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports will stay in place while negotiators put a potential trade war \u201con hold\u201d. \u201cThose were not part of our discussions,\u201d Mnuchin said, in apparent contradiction of earlier administration indications that the US was prepared to discuss all the trade issues tabled during the escalating dispute. Inconsistencies in the US position were also evident over the weekend, as US trade representative Robert Lighthizer warned China that the Trump administration might yet impose tariffs, just hours after Mnuchin\u2019s statement that the US would hold off on tariffs while negotiations continued. \u201cThe president can always put tariffs back on,\u201d Mnuchin chimed in again on Monday. That pattern was also repeated last week when Kudlow said China had offered to reduce its trade surplus with the United States by $200bn. But the Chinese foreign ministry denied that a deal was in place and the state-run People\u2019s Daily labeled the reports \u201ca misunderstanding\u201d. The figure was notably omitted from Saturday\u2019s joint communique. On Sunday, Mnuchin said that the administration put its trade war with China \u201con hold\u201d and Kudlow conceded: \u201cMaybe I got ahead of the curve.\u201d The Chinese reportedly indicated they cannot be certain that whatever agreement they may reach with Mnuchin would ultimately hold. \u201cGiven the increasing interaction between the two countries, we cannot assure you they will not encounter more frictions or disputes in the future,\u201d advised Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, at a briefing. Even the vague communique appeared to highlight divisions between Mnuchin, who is primarily interested in addressing the US $337bn trade deficit with China, and Lighthizer\u2019s focus on technology transfers. \u201cGetting China to open its market to more US exports is significant,\u201d Lighthizer said on Sunday. \u201cBut the far more important issues revolve around forced technology transfers, cyber theft and the protection of our innovation.\u201d The fourth member of the US negotiating team, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, has also had his share of problems. Last summer he was sharply contradicted by Trump after he attempted to strike a deal with China to reduce its steel production capacity. On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that discord over a China strategy was behind the administration\u2019s decision to put the imposition of tariffs on hold. That prompted former chief strategist and China hawk Steven Bannon to complain in a Bloomberg interview that the president had \u201cchanged the dynamic regarding China but in one weekend Secretary Mnuchin has given it away\u201d. Bannon accused Mnuchin of \u201ccompletely misread the geopolitical, military and historical precedents, and what President Trump had done was finally put the Chinese on their back heels\u201d. Reports, since denied by Trump, that the US was close to easing penalties against ZTE Corp and allowing the Chinese company to resume buying US components, was also criticized by lawmakers. Florida senator Marco Rubio accused the administration of being out-negotiated by China and accused it of giving ZTE a deal without giving up anything meaningful in return. Rubio tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cCan\u2019t emphasize enough what a crisis this is. #China is buying &amp; often stealing the next-generation software that powers our military &amp; is at core of our economy. We need to wake up before it is too late.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has been restructuring itself for about two decades, so no one can be surprised that the latest rejig is being rewritten already. It was as recently as November 2016 that the chief executive, Steve Rowe, declared that a \u201cforensic\u201d review of the store estate would mean 30 shop closures within five years. That figure became 60 a year later. Now it is 100, suggesting the original estimate was just a rough guess. Usdaw, the shopworkers\u2019 union, is right to complain about \u201csalami slicing\u201d \u2013 this programme should have been handled better for staff. For all that, restructuring is a way of life in modern retailing as the old guard struggles to adapt to the rise of online shopping. Once upon a time, a hubristic Tesco pitched its non-food Tesco Direct operation as a way to defeat Amazon in the UK; now it is opting for discretion and will close the unprofitable venture. In M&amp;S\u2019s case, there can be little confidence that the third iteration of the store plan will be the last. Twenty-five per cent of the old floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares will close but, if the opening of new stores (typically bigger out-of-town outlets) is taken into account, the net reduction will be closer to 10%. Is that bold enough, if you expect a third of your sales to be online by 2022? Even after the closures, M&amp;S will have 220 clothing and home outlets, whereas John Lewis serves England, Scotland and Wales from 51 department stores. The only real certainty is that restructuring is expensive. The extra financial damage from Rowe\u2019s more \u201cradical\u201d plan will likely be unveiled with Wednesday\u2019s full-year profit statement. But the fuller story is the astonishing \u00a3890m in \u201cadjustments to reported profit\u201d \u2013 all downwards adjustments, naturally \u2013 that the group has recorded over the last six years. Even at a business the size of M&amp;S, that\u2019s going some, especially when the end is not in sight. Shell\u2019s proxy war Companies are obliged to issue a few conciliatory words these days if more than 20% of votes are cast against the report on directors\u2019 remuneration. At Shell, where the protest was 25%, the charm offensive amounted to three short paragraphs that said, in effect, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d The high-ups in The Hague seem to have decided that the result can be dismissed because proxy voting agencies \u2013 firms that advise fund managers on how to vote \u2013 played a role. Thus the oil and gas giant said it \u201cwould particularly welcome the opportunity to work with proxy advisers more closely in the future\u201d. What Shell seems to be implying is that the revolting shareholders were silly to take their cue from outsiders. It\u2019s a favourite plea of companies on the receiving end of a pay rebellion: blame the proxies. Shell would have done better to reflect on why Institutional Shareholder Services, one of those firms, recommended a vote against a report that detailed the \u20ac8.9m (\u00a37.79m) pay packet awarded to the chief executive, Ben van Beurden. It objected to the \u201csilence\u201d in the report about the explosion of a Shell Pakistan oil tanker that killed more than 200 people. Shell\u2019s view is that, because the tanker was operated by a subcontractor, the disaster did not have to be considered when setting Van Beurden\u2019s pay; the bonus framework, you see, looks only at safety issues where Shell has \u201coperational control\u201d. That\u2019s advantageous for the executives, obviously. But, given the size of the disaster (and the fact that Shell\u2019s subsidiary paid a fine to the local regulator), it is surely entirely reasonable for ISS to suggest that the bonus setters think more deeply. Shell\u2019s lofty dismissal of the views of proxy agencies jars horribly. Halfords grinds the gears Halfords gets a new chief executive roughly every two years, and each one says the same thing: the business is full of potential, but more investment is needed in \u201cservice\u201d. Graham Stapleton, four months into the job, is the latest boss to repeat the diagnosis and he promptly knocked 12% off the share price. Pretax profits, after falling 5% last year to \u00a371.6m at an underlying level, will be flat this year, he said. The City had expected an improvement of at least 6%. The explanation, naturally, is that more money needs to be spent on training staff and marketing. It is also proving impossible to increase the price of bikes. When he unveils his full strategy in September, let us hope Stapleton spares shareholders another empty slogan. Matt Davies\u2019s \u201cGetting into Gear\u201d mantra was followed by Jill McDonald\u2019s \u201cMoving up a Gear\u201d, refrain but the share price is where it was in 2013. \u201cStill in Neutral\u201d might be more honest.",

Once upon a time, a hubristic Tesco pitched its non-food Tesco Direct operation as a way to defeat Amazon in the UK; now it is opting for discretion and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/22/tesco-shuts-its-online-non-food-website-tesco-direct\">will close the unprofitable venture</a>.</p> <p>In M&amp;S\u2019s case, there can be little confidence that the third iteration of the store plan will be the last. Twenty-five per cent of the old floorspace devoted to clothing and homewares will close but, if the opening of new stores (typically bigger out-of-town outlets) is taken into account, the net reduction will be closer to 10%. Is that bold enough, if you expect a third of your sales to be online by 2022? Even after the closures, M&amp;S will have 220 clothing and home outlets, whereas John Lewis serves England, Scotland and Wales from 51 department stores.</p> <p>The only real certainty is that restructuring is expensive. The extra financial damage from Rowe\u2019s more \u201cradical\u201d plan will likely be unveiled with Wednesday\u2019s full-year profit statement. But the fuller story is the astonishing \u00a3890m in \u201cadjustments to reported profit\u201d \u2013 all downwards adjustments, naturally \u2013 that the group has recorded over the last six years. Even at a business the size of M&amp;S, that\u2019s going some, especially when the end is not in sight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83442886f2329363d36d5827a26bc01b4cd6528e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83442886f2329363d36d5827a26bc01b4cd6528e/257_646_4575_2745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Shell chief executive, Ben van Beurden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Shell chief executive, Ben van Beurden, at the company\u2019s shareholder meeting in The Hague.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bart Maat/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Shell\u2019s proxy war<br></h2> <p>Companies are obliged to issue a few conciliatory words these days if more than 20% of votes are cast against the report on directors\u2019 remuneration. At Shell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/22/shell-climate-change-executive-pay-oil-carbon-emissions-agm\">where the protest was 25%</a>, the charm offensive amounted to three short paragraphs that said, in effect, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The high-ups in The Hague seem to have decided that the result can be dismissed because proxy voting agencies \u2013 firms that advise fund managers on how to vote \u2013 played a role. Thus the oil and gas giant said it \u201cwould particularly welcome the opportunity to work with proxy advisers more closely in the future\u201d.</p> <p>What Shell seems to be implying is that the revolting shareholders were silly to take their cue from outsiders. It\u2019s a favourite plea of companies on the receiving end of a pay rebellion: blame the proxies.</p> <p>Shell would have done better to reflect on why Institutional Shareholder Services, one of those firms, recommended a vote against a report that detailed the \u20ac8.9m (\u00a37.79m) pay packet awarded to the chief executive, Ben van Beurden. It objected to the \u201csilence\u201d in the report about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/25/overturned-oil-tanker-explodes-in-pakistan-killing-more-than-100\">explosion of a Shell Pakistan oil tanker</a> that killed more than 200 people.</p> <p>Shell\u2019s view is that, because the tanker was operated by a subcontractor, the disaster did not have to be considered when setting Van Beurden\u2019s pay; the bonus framework, you see, looks only at safety issues where Shell has \u201coperational control\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s advantageous for the executives, obviously. But, given the size of the disaster (and the fact that Shell\u2019s subsidiary paid a fine to the local regulator), it is surely entirely reasonable for ISS to suggest that the bonus setters think more deeply. Shell\u2019s lofty dismissal of the views of proxy agencies jars horribly.</p> <h2>Halfords grinds the gears</h2> <p>Halfords gets a new chief executive roughly every two years, and each one says the same thing: the business is full of potential, but more investment is needed in \u201cservice\u201d.</p> <p>Graham Stapleton, four months into the job, is the latest boss to repeat the diagnosis and he promptly knocked 12% off the share price. Pretax profits, after falling 5% last year to \u00a371.6m at an underlying level, will be flat this year, he said. The City had expected an improvement of at least 6%. The explanation, naturally, is that more money needs to be spent on training staff and marketing. It is also proving impossible to increase the price of bikes.</p> <p>When he unveils his full strategy in September, let us hope Stapleton spares shareholders another empty slogan. Matt Davies\u2019s \u201cGetting into Gear\u201d mantra was followed by Jill McDonald\u2019s \u201cMoving up a Gear\u201d, refrain but the share price is where it was in 2013. \u201cStill in Neutral\u201d might be more honest.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The EU is bracing itself for a trade war with the US, after Donald Trump\u2019s administration signalled to Brussels that it would not prolong the exemption granted to European steel and aluminium importers from its punitive tariffs. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European commissioner for trade, said that she expected the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, to make a recommendation to the White House in the coming days, but that the final decision would be taken by the president. A temporary exemption EU companies enjoy from a 25% tariff on steel and 10% tariff on aluminium brought in by Trump is due to come to an end on 1 June. At a summit in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, last week, EU leaders agreed to offer an increase in the amount of natural gas the US can import to Europe, reciprocal access for industrial products, including cars, and discussions on World Trade Organisation reform, if the White House was to lift the threat of tariffs. Malmstr\u00f6m said: \u201cIs this going to be enough? I am not sure, frankly. \u201cThere have been signals from the US that the exemptions will not be prolonged so either they will be imposed on us 1 June or there will other sorts of limiting measure \u2026 We have to prepare for different scenarios.\u201d Speaking after a meeting of trade ministers in Brussels on Tuesday, Malmstr\u00f6m said she was in twice-weekly contact with Ross, and trusted him to be honest with her about his advice to the president. Should tariffs be imposed on EU firms, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has threatened to slap tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorbikes, bourbon and bluejeans, among other US products. The 28 member states are, however, fractured over how to deal with Trump, whose tactics were described by Donald Tusk, the European council president, as being that of \u201ccapricious assertiveness\u201d. Germany, which has the most to lose from tariffs, has argued for a patient and generous response to the US\u2019s threats. The Netherlands and France have sought a tougher line, with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, describing Trump\u2019s behaviour as a threat to EU sovereignty. France\u2019s trade minister, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, said: \u201cWe are allies but we are not vassals.\u201d However, Peter Altmaier, Germany\u2019s finance minister, warned of the risks in tackling Trump head on. He said: \u201cWith an escalation not only on steel, but also other products, and also with regard to problems with Iran, Russia, we risk a lot more than just economic repercussions. \u201cWhether the result will be positive, no one can say, but we lose if we don\u2019t at least try. I remain optimistic that a solution can be found if both sides are interested in it and if both sides are prepared to move in the right direction.\u201d Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, suggested it would take a more generous offer from Brussels to convince the US to lift the threat of tariffs. He said: \u201cI think that on June 1 we will have another deadlock. Perhaps we will take a step forward in terms of what we can offer the Americans.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Robbie Williams has been hired to perform at a party to celebrate the business success of the Uzbek-born Russian billionaire and Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov. Williams, who released a 2016 track titled Party Like a Russian, is headlining an event this week to celebrate 25 years of MegaFon, a Russian mobile phone company largely owned and controlled by Usmanov, according to Bloomberg. The glitzy event is billed as the star afterparty ticket at Russia\u2019s version of the World Economic Forum. The three-day St Petersburg International Economic Forum, which kicks off on Thursday, is as known for its champagne-fuelled celebrity parties as its business networking. The forum, which is this year celebrating \u201cBuilding a Trust Economy\u201d, will be chaired by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and attended by many of the country\u2019s leading businessmen. Williams\u2019 spokesperson said: \u201cNo comment.\u201d MegaFon representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Usmanov is the eighth richest person with a residence in the UK, with a \u00a310.5bn fortune, according to the Sunday Times rich list. He lives in a \u00a348m mansion in north London and owns a Tudor manor house, Sutton Place in Surrey. Usmanov made most of his fortune in steel and iron ore before investing it in technology businesses including Facebook, Alibaba, Airbnb and Spotify. He owns a 30% stake in Arsenal FC. Party Like a Russian was criticised in Russia for repeating offensive stereotypes and accused of being borderline xenophobic. Williams was warned he might not be able to perform in the country. The song, from his 2016 album The Heavy Entertainment Show, includes the lyrics: \u201cParty like a Russian, oh / Have it like an oligarch / I\u2019ve got Stoli and Bolly and molly, so I\u2019m jolly /And I\u2019m always off my trolley, so I never say sorry.\u201d In the video for the track, Williams sings about a leader who \u201calleviates the cash from a whole entire nation, takes loose change and builds his own space station\u201d, and adds: \u201cAin\u2019t no refutin\u2019 or disputin\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m a modern Rasputin\u201d, while women dressed as ballerinas dance around him. Several heads of state are also signed up to attend the St Petersberg summit including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, and Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. The organisers boasted that business deals worth $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) were signed during last year\u2019s event, which brought together more than 14,000 participants from 143 countries. In an address to delegates in a specially produced forum magazine, Putin said: \u201cDuring open discussions at the forum, leading Russian and foreign politicians, academics, experts, corporate executives and business association leaders, and representatives from the media and civil society will discuss key questions on the global agenda, and the current state and future prospects of the world economy. \u201cTogether, they will consider how to steer the world economy towards steady growth. By harnessing the wealth of scientific and technological potential which is rapidly expanding in digital and other areas today, we can improve quality of life and boost stable and harmonious development in all nations and across the world as a whole.\u201d The forum has arranged special \u201cbusiness dialogue\u201d sessions to discuss Russian relations with several countries and regions, including Africa, the US, India, France and Sweden.

      "bodyText": "Further optimism that a trade war between the US and China could be averted has helped lift European markets, despite a drag from Wall Street. Apart from the FTSE 100 reaching a new peak, other major markets also ended higher, even in Italy despite continuing concerns about the plans of its new coalition. As for the US, there were more signs of strength in the country\u2019s economy with a new manufacturing survey. Dave Madden of CMC Markets said: The US Richmond manufacturing index soared to 16 in May from -3 in April. Economists were expecting a reading of 9. The solid manufacturing report underlines the strength of the US economy. Some traders predict the Federal Reserve will raise rates three more times in 2018, and economic announcements like this reinforce their beliefs. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% or 18.28 points at 7877.45 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.71% to13,169.92 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.05% to 5640.10 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.54% to 23,216.57 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.72% at 10,138.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 37 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More on a possible UK interest rate rise this year, following the select committee appearance of Bank of England policymakers this morning. Andrew Wilson at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said: Comments concerning monetary policy largely echo this month\u2019s Monetary Policy Meeting. We still see scope for one rate hike this year, most likely in the fourth quarter and we think the pace of UK monetary tightening thereafter will be gradual given uncertainties around determinants of recent activity softness. We also suspect policymakers will await further clarity from macro data before providing further guidance on the timing of any future rate hikes. Inconclusive Brexit negotiations, and uncertainty around when the inflation impact from referendum-related currency depreciation will fade, create additional challenges for the BoE. If the FTSE 100 is to reach 8000 for the first time, it might need to be soon, says Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, before the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates: A weaker pound, a further easing of tensions between US and China and stronger commodity prices encouraged the FTSE to continue its steady rise towards its 8000 target. Now just 100 points away, with momentum on its side and the pound looking more fragile than it has for a while, 8000 is a very reasonable target. The inverse relationship that exists between the pound and the FTSE thanks to a large percentage of FTSE firms earning revenue outside of the UK, is expected to help the FTSE break higher into unchartered territory towards 8000, sooner rather than later. After weeks of softer than forecast UK economic data, most recently a fall in factory output to the lowest level in two years, plus Brexit uncertainties and a BoE that is happy to sit on the side-lines, key factors are aligned for a soft pound and another push higher by the FTSE. With the harsh weather conditions well behind us, the outlook for the economy is looking up, according to the BoE, making an August rate hike once again a possibility. Should investors start to believe that the August hike is well and truly back on the table, the pound could start to pick up off year to date lows, making it harder for the FTSE to reach 8000. With this in mind, the FTSE\u2019s final move higher to 8000 needs to be in the bag sooner rather than later to guarantee a hit, otherwise a stronger pound is likely to prevent that psychological level being struck this summer. The UK\u2019s leading share index has closed at a new record, but it is off the intra-day highs it recorded earlier in the afternoon. The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% at 7877.45 having early climbed to a new all time peak of 7903.50. Chinese plans to cut import tariffs on US cars has helped support markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets are pushing upwards amid improving US-Chinese trade talks, and a weakening pound. The pound has been suffering in late trade, coming off the back of a CBI report that showed UK manufacturing output to be growing at the slowest rate in two-years. With manufacturing failing to gather momentum, there is a fear that we will see the focus of UK economic weakness shift from construction in Q1 to manufacturing in Q2.... Improving US-Chinese relations continue to help improve risk sentiment as the week progresses, with news that China has pledged to reduce levies on automakers and car parts helping the likes of General Electric gain ground. While car makers welcomed news that China will cut tariffs on both imported cars (15% from 25%) and car parts (6% from average of 10%), these still remain comparatively high and are unlikely to alter the status quo of firms basing production in China to avoid such levies. China remains the largest car producing nation in the world, and this token gesture is unlikely to really make any dent in that dynamic. While the benefits from this reduction in Chinese levies are questionable, the decision to let ZTE off the hook for brazenly defying US sanctions on Iran and North Korea is a big boost for China given they employed 80,000 workers. While on face value the Chinese seem to be getting more from this deal, todays deal at least helps reinstate demand for US listed firms Qualcomm and Dolby, from whom ZTE buy many of their processing chips. The FTSE 100 continues to set new records, briefly breaking through the 7900 barrier for the first time as the close of the trading day approaches. More bad news for retail workers: Tesco is shutting its clothing and homewares website Tesco Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk. Staff were briefed on Tuesday afternoon about the decision to close the loss-making website which was the supermarket giant\u2019s attempt to take on Amazon. Tesco said it had conducted a detailed review of the operation but could not come up with a plan that would make the business, which sells thousands of products ranging from toys, to clothing and electrical appliances, profitable. As a result the retailer said approximately 500 staff were at risk of redundancy. \u201cThis decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,\u201d said Charles Wilson who is the new boss of Tesco\u2019s UK chain. \u201cWe want to offer our customers the ability to buy groceries and non-food products in one place and that\u2019s why we are focusing our investment into one online platform.\u201d Our full report is here: Wall Street has now slipped into negative territory but that has not stopped the FTSE 100 from hitting new heights. The UK index is now up 0.45% at a new intra-day peak of 7896, helped by the pound losing most of its earlier gains. Against the dollar sterling is now up just 0.08% at $1.3435. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The fact cable\u2019s gains more than halved as the day went on freed the UK index up to shake off its early reticence, the FTSE adding around 25 points in value. That sent it above 7890 for the first time in its history, in the process making the mythic 8000 mark closer to becoming a reality. Whether or not the FTSE can actually reach that landmark level this week may be down to a couple of factors. One: the performance of Brent Crude. The black stuff re-crossed $80 per barrel on Tuesday as supply concerns relating to Venezuela and Iran continued to heighten. However, BP and Shell were resistant to this rise, instead falling 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. If the FTSE is to keep rising, then its oil colossi need to get on board. Two: how sterling reacts to the week\u2019s data. The inflation reading on Wednesday and the 2nd estimate Q1 GDP figure on Friday are both potential lightning rods for a pound-rebound, dependant on whether or not they beat the expected stagnation. If they don\u2019t, and cable hits a fresh 2018 low, then the FTSE may be in for a boost. Oil is on the rise again with Brent crude back above the $80 a barrel level it breached last week. It is currently up 1.17% at $80.15 on renewed concerns about falling supplies from struggling Venezuela, as well as Iran after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: The prospect of further Iran sanctions coupled with the disputed election results in Venezuela have helped to firm oil prices. President Trump and the White House have made clear that any new Iran deal would require the country to stop enriching all uranium and halt support for militant groups in the region. Iran\u2019s government has rejected these demands, increasing the chance that the US could impose severe economic sanctions on the country. Sanctions would reduce oil supply. The possibility of a drastic fall in Iran\u2019s output has helped to support oil prices in recent months. Oil prices were also pushed higher by the disputed election in Venezuela. The US has promptly responded with sanctions that seek to greatly restrict investment in debts issued by the Venezuelan government or Venezuelan agencies, although the US did not ban the purchase of oil itself. Analysts will be watching closely to see how the situation develops. Hopes for a positive outcome from the US-China trade talks, US markets have edged higher in early trading. With technology stocks benefiting from the prospect that the two countries can avoid a damaging trade war, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 11 points or 0.04% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% higher and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.36% better. Here\u2019s our story on the Bank of England committee hearing: British households are more than \u00a3900 worse off following the vote to leave the European Union, according to the governor of the Bank of England. Comparing forecasts made by Threadneedle Street before the referendum, prepared on the basis of a remain vote, Mark Carney told MPs that household incomes were now significantly lower than expected. \u201cReal household incomes are about \u00a3900 per household lower than we forecast in May of 2016, which is a lot of money,\u201d he said. Speaking in front of the Treasury select committee of MPs, Carney also said the economy was 2% smaller than forecast before the EU referendum, despite the strength of the global economy and an emergency rate cut from the Bank after the Brexit vote. \u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable difference\u201d to forecasts for the economy made in May 2016, he added. Although admitting it was difficult to say with certainty that Brexit was the sole reason for lower household incomes, the Bank governor suggested the referendum outcome played a significant role. Previous analysis by economists has put the potential cost for each British household of voting to leave the EU at \u00a3600 a year. The full report is here: The recent poor performance of shares in Marks &amp; Spencer mean the venerable retailer is in danger of falling out of the FTSE 100 when the latest index changes are announced next week. It looks just about safe at the moment, despite a near 3% decline in its shares today, but the reaction to this week\u2019s results could be crucial. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: Whilst investors will be hoping that the company\u2019s full year results, due to be released to the market tomorrow, will provide a similar boost to that rival Next received recently, the harsh reality is that the retail environment continues to hugely weigh on this well-known and respected retailer. M&amp;S is likely to find itself amongst the relegation places as a result of weak figures in its all-important food business released to the market earlier this year. Whilst there have been some encouraging signs that the new management team on the clothing side is having some impact, competitive pressure from rivals and relatively weak consumer sentiment has left sales growth uninspiring. Its full year results could ultimately decide its fate, at least in regards to its future in the FTSE 100. Ironically one of the candidates to replace M&amp;S if it did drop out is Ocado following the recent surge in its shares after its big US contract win. G4S and Severn Trent are among the others who could lose their place in the top flight index, while FTSE 250 constituents Weir and GVC are knocking on the door. Sterling moved higher during the Bank of England testimony, helped by what was seen as a hawkish tone from MPC policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe and a softening of the dollar ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve minutes. But the rally did not last long amid renewed signs of a weak UK economy which casts some doubt on the pace of further interest rate rises. So the FTSE 100, whose overseas earners benefit from a slide in sterling, is heading for new heights. It has already hit a new all time peak of 7887 and even though it has fallen back to 7879, up 0.26%, that would still mark a new record close if it holds on to its gains. While Mark Carney was speaking to MPs, the UK economy received two pieces of bad news. Marks &amp; Spencer, the high street chain, has announced it is closing more than 100 stores by 2022, It has identified 14 stores that will close in the next year, affecting more than 600 staff, as the company tries to tackle falling profits and growing competition from online retailers. Secondly, UK factory orders have weakened this month to their lowest level since November 2016. The CBI reported that weak domestic demand hurt British manufacturers, while export orders held up better. The campaign for a second Brexit vote have seized on Mark Carney\u2019s comments: Ruth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group (who is optimistic about Brexit), isn\u2019t impressed by Carney\u2019s calculation: The Evening Standard is splashing on Carney\u2019s comments: Perhaps the editor, a prominent Remain campaigner two years ago, feels his warnings of economic pain if people voted for Brexit are coming true.... Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake tweets: The Bank of England governor gave MPs a clear reminder of the cost of the 2016 EU referendum today, by warning that households are \u00a3900 worse off today than expected. During his testimony to the Treasury Committee, Mark Carney explained that the UK economy is currently 1% smaller than expected two years ago. That\u2019s despite the world economy, and particularly the eurozone, growing faster than forecast since then. According to Carney, if you adjust for the stronger global economy and the UK government\u2019s fiscal easing, the UK is actually around 1.75% smaller, perhaps even 2%, than you might expected today. That has a real impact on families and individuals across the country. As Carney puts it: If you map it onto household incomes, real household incomes are about \u00a3900 lower than we forecast, which is a lot of money. Some of this loss can clearly be ascribed to Brexit. Business investment has been up to 4% weaker than forecast -- as firms have been hit by uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future trading relationships. Households have suffered by the drop in real incomes (which turned negative last year), due to the plunge in sterling after the referendum. The weaker pound drove up inflation, meaning salaries and pensions didn\u2019t go as far in the shops. As Carney puts it: \u201cThere are Brexit effects that come through\u201d But, the governor did also cite Britain\u2019s ongoing productivity problems - partly due to weak investment, but also due to a series of wider issues that can\u2019t be pinned on the Brexit vote. In conclusion, Carney warned: \u201cIn the short term, over the last year and a half, there has been an impact relative to what we would have expected, even with some pretty good tailwinds on the back of this economy.\u201d John Mann MP asks Mark Carney a series of mischievous and piercing questions. Mann gets Carney to confirm that he is still planning to leave the Bank of England in June 2019. He\u2019s confident that the government can \u2018multitask\u2019 and choose a successor despite the pressure of Brexit. But Mann points out that there are rumours of a general election this autumn. So within a few months (if Labour wins power), the Bank of England could be given a new remit to target unemployment as well as inflation. Q: Is the Bank of England prepared for a change in your remit? Carney says he believes the Bank\u2019s remit should indeed be reviewed every five to eight years. Whatever remit parliament give us, we will implement. The current remit is \u2018absolutely fit for purpose\u2019, Carney insists. Mann suggests that it might be better to make any remit changed before, rather than after, a new governor is appointed. That could be an argument for Carney staying on longer at the Bank. Mann then swerves to a different issue: Q: What impact has Simon Cowell had on the UK economy? Mann explains that Cowell (of the X-Factor and Britain\u2019s Got Talent) has driven a change in behaviour - more people are staying in on Saturday nights rather than going out. Carney says the Bank has beefed up its expertise in behavioural economics in recent years, to track these trends. He suggests social media and the internet is probably a bigger factor, though: Q: Britain has become a world leader in wind power. So given the importance of green energy, shouldn\u2019t the Bank be taking a bigger role in driving the economic case? Carney agrees that this is a hugely important issue - citing Britain\u2019s \u2018world leadership\u2019 in, for example, using artificial intelligence to drive new power grids. This is too long-term to influence the Monetary Policy Committee...but it\u2019s certainly an important issue for the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, who are looking at whether firms are well-prepared for changes. Carney says the UK has taken a global lead in \u201cbetter climate disclosure\u201d - encouraging companies to report how climate change will affect them. He says the top six banks, asset managers, major insurers have signed up - there are now $90 trillion of assets behind the initiative. The backdrop to this question, though, is that activist investor Christopher Hohn has written to the BoE, demanding stricter rules on how banks deal with the risks of climate change. Hohn argues that UK banks are exposed to a wide range of \u201cserious climate-related risks\u201d through their loan books, but investors aren\u2019t being given enough information. More here. That\u2019s the end of the session. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden confirms Mark Carney\u2019s earlier estimate that UK households are \u00a3900 worse off today than forecast in May 2016, before the Brexit vote. Q: There\u2019s a lot of debate about whether the Brexit transition period should be extended. What\u2019s your view, governor? I watch the debate with interest, Mark Carney blocks smartly with a smile. Q: Is the current transition period long enough? It\u2019s what\u2019s been agreed by the political leaders, Carney replies smoothly. Q: You wouldn\u2019t have any objection to the transition period being extended? I think some could have an objection to me answering that question, the governor grins. Q: Surveys show that Brexit uncertainty among businesses has fallen recently. Do you think it remains high, and is it really falling? Carney agrees that there has been a small improvement in business confidence about Brexit since Britain and Europe agreed a transition deal in March, \u201cas you would hope\u201d. The decisive issue, though, will be whether a final agreement is reached later this year. Gertjan Vlieghe also denies that QE has fuelled Britain\u2019s housing market. He points out that many countries have used quantitative easing to stimulate their economies since the financial crisis - but Britain is the only one to have seen such as house price boom. [Bank policymakers recently published a paper on the consequence of QE - arguing that it had actually reduced wealth inequality.] Q: Hasn\u2019t QE solidified intergenerational inequality, and made it even harder for Generation Rent to buy a home? How can we unwind that problem? Deputy governor Dave Ramsden says it is an important issue...but not one that is particularly within the Bank of England\u2019s remit to solve. Ramsden (previously chief economic adviser to HM Treasury) points out that supply-side constraints have driven house prices up for decades. Tackling housing affordability is ultimately an issue for the government, Ramsden, insists, as they can change land use and the tax system. Q: Has the Bank of England\u2019s quantitative easing programme failed, by driving up asset prices when the Bank is meant to be targeting consumer price inflation? QE is the process by which the Bank buys government debt from commercial banks, to encourage them to buy other assets. Those assets (commercial bonds, shares, commodities) tend to be owned by wealthier people. Carney, though, denies that QE was a blunder. \u201cThe policy has worked\u201d, he says, pointing out that unemployment (arguably the biggest cause of inequality) has fallen steadily in recent years. The Brexit dividend? Q: Do you accept that Britain\u2019s extremely low interest rates mean there is no incentive for businesses to invest capital? No, Carney replies firmly. He doesn\u2019t accept that swathes of \u2018zombie firms\u2019 are being propped up across the UK by extra-low interest rates, making it hard for better firms to compete. The number of such companies has fallen in recent years, he insists, as poor performing companies are driven out of the economy. Instead, Brexit uncertainty has been hurting business investment - as firms decide to sit on the sidelines until the future becomes clearer. Back in parliament, Michael Saunders has been reminded that he\u2019s been outvoted no fewer than five times at the Bank of England when he has pushed, in vain, for interest rates. Q: Why were you outvoted so many times? Well, mathematically, it\u2019s because there were more votes to leave interest rates unchanged, says Saunders patiently. Saunders thinks borrowing costs should have risen faster, to reflect the strong UK labour market. With unemployment at its lowest rate since the early 1970s, wages should be rising (not that we can see much sign of it yet!), so the Bank should be alert for inflationary pressures building. The Treasury has welcome the news that UK borrowing fell last month. A Treasury spokesperson says: \u201cBorrowing is at the lowest level for a decade, which shows our balanced approach is working. We are backing public services, keeping taxes low, and investing \u00a331 billion more in infrastructure and skills as we build an economy that is fit for the future.\u201d Breaking away from parliament.... Britain\u2019s public finances were stronger than expected last month. The UK borrowed \u00a36.2bn in April, down from \u00a37.3bn a year ago. That\u2019s a better start to the new financial year than expected. In another boost, the total deficit for the last financial year was \u00a32bn lower than expected. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, explains: \u201cThere was more good news for the Chancellor on the public finances today, with estimated public borrowing in 2017/18 revised down by just over \u00a32 billion relative to initial estimates published last month. This reflects a combination of stronger tax receipts and lower government spending. Carney adds that the economic activity lost under the snow last winter won\u2019t be clawed back - which is why the Bank was cautious about raising interest rates this month. Q: Why does the Bank of England think the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 hurt growth in the last quarter, while the Office for National Statistics says snow didn\u2019t have an effect? Mark Carney says the ONS\u2019s data was based on a questionnaire sent to businesses - \u2018very few\u2019 people answered the question, he claims. The Bank, though, sent its regional agents out to actually talk to firms around the country. They reported that the snow had a negative effect. Q: Do you believe the Bank should give more \u2018explicit\u2019 guidance for the future path of interest rates, as Gertjan Vlieghe argued this morning? Deputy governor Dave Ramsden is sceptical that this is a good idea. He thinks it could be \u2018lost in translation\u2019, and mistaken for a promise for how interest rates would change. MPC member Michael Saunders agrees - he tells MPs there is \u201cno way\u201d the Bank could give an unconditional forecast for the path of interest rates. But, Saunders thinks there is value in giving an estimate for the neutral rate of interest (R*, for economists in the room) - the rate at which the economy is growing at its long-term trend rate, while inflation remains stable. Governor Carney says the MPC have discussed the issue, and a majority of members were opposed to giving more explicit guidance. Vlieghe has now been joined by the boss, governor Mark Carney, along with deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden and fellow external policymaker Michael Saunders. As predicted, Carney is being asked to justify the Bank\u2019s decision to leave interest rate on hold in May, despite hinting at a rise in February. Governor Carney says that Britain\u2019s households and businesses understand the Bank\u2019s position, that interest rates will rise at a limited and gradual rate. They have got that message. On the May decision, Carney says he doesn\u2019t believe that the UK economy is as weak as suggested by the GDP figures for the first quarter of this year (growth of just 0.1%). There were \u201ctemporary, idiosyncratic factors that hit growth in the first quarter\u201d, the governor explains. So he felt it was best to leave interest rates on hold until more data comes in. NEWSFLASH: Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has predicted that interest rates could rise up to six times in the next three years, sending the pound jumping. Vlieghe makes the forecast in his written evidence to the Treasury committee, which has just been released. He predicts there will be one or two 0.25% increases per year, over the next 36 months. His forecast is a little more hawkish than the Bank of England\u2019s own central forecast. Vlieghe says: My current forecast for growth and inflation is consistent with a gradually rising path of interest rates. My own central projection will require one or two quarter point rate increases per year over the three-year forecast period. That path would bring us closer to the neutral policy rate, which I continue to think is likely to be well below the neutral rate that prevailed before the recession. Six quarter-point increases would take UK interest rates up to 2% by 2021, from 0.5% today. This has sent the pound up almost half a cent. Vlieghe adde that there is \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d in this forecast, partly because he doesn\u2019t know how the UK economy will evolve in the years ahead (especially given the uncertainty created by Brexit). He adds: My central forecast for policy rates is slightly above the conditioning path of rates derived from market yields in the May Inflation Report forecast, which assumes just under three quarter point rate increases over the three-year forecast period. Gertjan Vlieghe has also suggested that the Bank of England could give clearer guidance on interest rate policy. He tells MPs that he has suggested that policymakers give more \u2018explicit\u2019 forecasts for how they think borrowing costs will change in the future. He concedes, though, that this could create a risk - investors could \u201cunderestimate the degree of uncertainty\u201d if central banks become too precise in their communication of the projected future path of interest rates. The US Federal Reserve has a similar policy already - its policymakers create a \u2018dot chart\u2019 each quarter suggesting how many interest rate changes they expect. The Treasury committee is now asking about the Bank of England\u2019s communications. Why did the Bank hint in February that interest rates would rise faster than previously expected, only to leave them on hold in May?. There\u2019s a difference between knowing that the future is uncertain, and not knowing what\u2019s going on, Vlieghe insists. As data comes in, the Bank adjusts its view for the future path of interest rates. Asked about Brexit, Gertjan Vlieghe says that there was \u201cmuch less of a response than we thought\u201d in the immediate aftermath of the referendum in 2016. But there is now a \u201cclear effect\u201d, he adds, citing the \u2018dampening effect\u2019 of Brexit on investment. The Treasury Committee is underway, starting with Gertjan Vlieghe - who is taking up a second three-year term on the Monetary Policy Committee. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Vlieghe cites the pick-up in the global economy, and the \u2018dampening effect\u2019 of the Brexit vote on UK growth, as the two big themes of his first three years Vleighe says he is broadly in line with the Bank\u2019s central forecast - and predicts that UK interest rates will rise very gradually over the next few years. Financial newswire RANsquawk point out that things could be worse for Carney - at least one critic won\u2019t be there today (JRM has moved to parliament\u2019s \u201cExiting the EU Committee\u201d). I suspect that Mark Carney would happily forego today\u2019s inquisition at parliament. He won\u2019t welcome being quizzed about his \u2018forward guidance\u2019 -- the hints about an interest rate rise that didn\u2019t materialise this week. He could do without another debate on Brexit risks too. And he would certainly rather avoid being asked whether he agrees with Ben Broadbent that the UK\u2019s economy is entering a \u2018climacteric\u2019, or \u2018menopausal\u2019, phase. Communication is a key weapon for today\u2019s central bankers. But perhaps Carney should ponder whether \u201cless is more\u201d when he speaks to financial markets. As Bloomberg puts it: After a bruising month that\u2019s seen his own signals on interest rates questioned and one of his deputies forced to apologize for calling the economy menopausal, communication is once again a hot topic for the Bank of England governor. Carney, who arrived at the BOE in 2013 with forward guidance as his signature policy, will come under more scrutiny this week when he faces a grilling from U.K. lawmakers. He\u2019ll also give speeches in London and Stockholm. \u201cSome people would say the safest thing for the Bank of England to do right now is to go back to being mystical,\u201d said Clea Bourne, a senior lecturer and financial communications specialist at Goldsmiths, University of London. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Mark Carney is in the spotlight this morning as MPs quiz the Bank of England governor about the state of the UK economy, and his latest u-turn on interest rates. The Treasury Committee will question Carney, deputy governor Dave Ramsden, and policymakers Michael Saunders and Gertjan Vlieghe, about this month\u2019s quarterly inflation report. They\u2019ll be asked to explain why the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee left UK borrowing costs unchanged this month at just 0.5%, having previously dropped hints that a rate rise was coming. That decision saw Carney labelled, again, as an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 for making promises and never sticking to them. But the governor has a defence. He can point to the sharp slowdown in UK growth this year - GDP rose by just 0.1% in January-March. But with unemployment at a 43-year low, and employment at a record high, is the economy really that weak? The quartet can also expect some questions about Brexit, as concern builds about Britain\u2019s likely trading relationships with the EU after 2019. Sterling is looking edgy ahead of the hearing, having dropped below $1.34 yesterday to its lowest level this year. The pound could rally if Carney and colleagues sound confident that rates will rise in the next few months. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains what investors will be looking for: Today\u2019s Treasury Select Committee testimony of Messrs Carney, Ramsden, Saunders and Vlieghe are also likely to be important benchmarks as to policymakers thinking with respect to the timing of such a move and in particular David Ramsden and Gertjan Vlieghe\u2019s thinking on it. There won\u2019t be any surprises around Michael Saunders view giving he voted to raise rates last month, and Mark Carney\u2019s view tends to change as often as the weather forecast, but Ramsden\u2019s views are likely to be key given that he suggested in a February interview that rates would have to rise more quickly given recent increases in wages. Against that backdrop it was a bit of a surprise that the Bank of England then proceeded to revise their assessment for wages lower for the rest of this year, so his views on why the central bank has become less bullish on wages are likely to be important, as are Vlieghe\u2019s. Unfortunately, deputy governor Ben Broadbent is not on the panel, so he won\u2019t be called to account for last week\u2019s gaffe (using the word \u2018menopause\u2019 when explaining how Britain\u2019s economy was past its peak). The Treasury Committee will kick off with a session with Gertjan Vlieghe, who is being reappointed for a second term at the MPC. Also coming up today..... We get public finance figures for April, which will probably show that Britain borrowed around \u00a37bn to balance the books last month. There\u2019s also a healthcheck on UK manufacturing from the CBI. European markets are expected to be subdued, after Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hit a record high yesterday. In the City, bike and car parts chain Halfords, publisher Bloomsbury and building society Nationwide are releasing results (more on that shortly). Plus, oil giant Shell is holding its AGM. Shareholders will be pushing the company to set tougher carbon reduction targets to help tackle global warming.

Now just 100 points away, with momentum on its side and the pound looking more fragile than it has for a while, 8000 is a very reasonable target.</p> <p>The inverse relationship that exists between the pound and the FTSE thanks to a large percentage of FTSE firms earning revenue outside of the UK, is expected to help the FTSE break higher into unchartered territory towards 8000, sooner rather than later. After weeks of softer than forecast UK economic data, most recently a fall in factory output to the lowest level in two years, plus Brexit uncertainties and a BoE that is happy to sit on the side-lines, key factors are aligned for a soft pound and another push higher by the FTSE.</p> <p>With the harsh weather conditions well behind us, the outlook for the economy is looking up, according to the BoE, making an August rate hike once again a possibility. Should investors start to believe that the August hike is well and truly back on the table, the pound could start to pick up off year to date lows, making it harder for the FTSE to reach 8000. With this in mind, the FTSE\u2019s final move higher to 8000 needs to be in the bag sooner rather than later to guarantee a hit, otherwise a stronger pound is likely to prevent that psychological level being struck this summer. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b043ae8e4b0738b88745de0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:46:29.439Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 hits new closing high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK\u2019s leading share index has closed at a new record, but it is off the intra-day highs it recorded earlier in the afternoon.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 finished up 0.23% at 7877.45 having early climbed to a new all time peak of 7903.50. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0435a3e4b05aef3eee8748\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:23:07.796Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chinese plans to cut import tariffs on US cars has helped support markets. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> European markets are pushing upwards amid improving US-Chinese trade talks, and a weakening pound. The pound has been suffering in late trade, coming off the back of a CBI report that showed UK manufacturing output to be growing at the slowest rate in two-years. With manufacturing failing to gather momentum, there is a fear that we will see the focus of UK economic weakness shift from construction in Q1 to manufacturing in Q2....</p> <p>Improving US-Chinese relations continue to help improve risk sentiment as the week progresses, with news that China has pledged to reduce levies on automakers and car parts helping the likes of General Electric gain ground. While car makers welcomed news that China will cut tariffs on both imported cars (15% from 25%) and car parts (6% from average of 10%), these still remain comparatively high and are unlikely to alter the status quo of firms basing production in China to avoid such levies. China remains the largest car producing nation in the world, and this token gesture is unlikely to really make any dent in that dynamic.</p> <p> While the benefits from this reduction in Chinese levies are questionable, the decision to let ZTE off the hook for brazenly defying US sanctions on Iran and North Korea is a big boost for China given they employed 80,000 workers. While on face value the Chinese seem to be getting more from this deal, todays deal at least helps reinstate demand for US listed firms Qualcomm and Dolby, from whom ZTE buy many of their processing chips.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:24:07.784Z\">at 4.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b0433d4e4b0a1f834770c9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T15:15:07.168Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 continues to set new records, briefly breaking through the 7900 barrier for the first time as the close of the trading day approaches.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b042c24e4b0a1f834770c1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/zoewood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T14:42:44.486Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More bad news for retail workers:</p> <blockquote> <p>Tesco is shutting its clothing and homewares website <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a> Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk.</p> <p>Staff were briefed on Tuesday afternoon about the decision to close the loss-making website which was the supermarket giant\u2019s attempt to take on Amazon.</p> <p>Tesco said it had conducted a detailed review of the operation but could not come up with a plan that would make the business, which sells thousands of products ranging from toys, to clothing and electrical appliances, profitable.

That sent it above 7890 for the first time in its history, in the process making the mythic 8000 mark closer to becoming a reality.</p> <p>Whether or not the FTSE can actually reach that landmark level this week may be down to a couple of factors. One: the performance of Brent Crude. The black stuff re-crossed $80 per barrel on Tuesday as supply concerns relating to Venezuela and Iran continued to heighten. However, BP and Shell were resistant to this rise, instead falling 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. If the FTSE is to keep rising, then its oil colossi need to get on board. </p> <p>Two: how sterling reacts to the week\u2019s data. The inflation reading on Wednesday and the 2<sup>nd</sup> estimate Q1 GDP figure on Friday are both potential lightning rods for a pound-rebound, dependant on whether or not they beat the expected stagnation.

Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prospect of further Iran sanctions coupled with the disputed election results in Venezuela have helped to firm oil prices. President Trump and the White House have made clear that any new Iran deal would require the country to stop enriching all uranium and halt support for militant groups in the region. Iran\u2019s government has rejected these demands, increasing the chance that the US could impose severe economic sanctions on the country. Sanctions would reduce oil supply. The possibility of a drastic fall in Iran\u2019s output has helped to support oil prices in recent months. </p> <p>Oil prices were also pushed higher by the disputed election in Venezuela. The US has promptly responded with sanctions that seek to greatly restrict investment in debts issued by the Venezuelan government or Venezuelan agencies, although the US did not ban the purchase of oil itself.

That\u2019s despite the world economy, and particularly the eurozone, growing faster than forecast since then.</p> <p>According to Carney, if you adjust for the stronger global economy and the UK government\u2019s fiscal easing, the UK is actually around 1.75% smaller, <strong>perhaps even 2%</strong>, than you might expected today.</p> <p>That has a real impact on families and individuals across the country.</p> <p>As Carney puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you map it onto household incomes, real household incomes are about \u00a3900 lower than we forecast, which is a lot of money.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of this loss can clearly be ascribed to Brexit. Business investment has been up to 4% weaker than forecast -- as firms have been hit by uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future trading relationships.</p> <p>Households have suffered by the drop in real incomes (which turned negative last year), due to the plunge in sterling after the referendum. The weaker pound drove up inflation, meaning salaries and pensions didn\u2019t go as far in the shops.</p> <p>As Carney puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere are Brexit effects that come through\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But, the governor did also cite Britain\u2019s ongoing productivity problems - partly due to weak investment, but also due to a series of wider issues that can\u2019t be pinned on the Brexit vote.</p> <p>In conclusion, Carney warned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIn the short term, over the last year and a half, there has been an impact relative to what we would have expected, even with some pretty good tailwinds on the back of this economy.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T11:20:24.795Z\">at 12.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b03ed98e4b0738b887458ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-22T10:35:27.730Z\">11.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>John Mann MP asks Mark Carney a series of mischievous and piercing questions.</strong></p> <p>Mann gets Carney to confirm that he is still planning to leave the Bank of England in June 2019. He\u2019s confident that the government can \u2018multitask\u2019 and choose a successor despite the pressure of Brexit.</p> <p>But Mann points out that there are rumours of a general election this autumn. So within a few months (if Labour wins power), the Bank of England could be given a new remit to target unemployment as well as inflation.</p> <p><em>Q: Is the Bank of England prepared for a change in your remit?</em></p> <p>Carney says he believes the Bank\u2019s remit should indeed be reviewed every five to eight years. Whatever remit parliament give us, we will implement.</p> <p>The current remit is \u2018absolutely fit for purpose\u2019, Carney insists.</p> <p>Mann suggests that it might be better to make any remit changed before, rather than after, a new governor is appointed. That could be an argument for Carney staying on longer at the Bank.</p> <p>Mann then swerves to a different issue:</p> <p><em>Q: What impact has Simon Cowell had on the UK economy?</em><br></p> <p>Mann explains that Cowell (of the X-Factor and Britain\u2019s Got Talent) has driven a change in behaviour - more people are staying in on Saturday nights rather than going out.</p> <p>Carney says the Bank has beefed up its expertise in behavioural economics in recent years, to track these trends. He suggests social media and the internet is probably a bigger factor, though:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/david_milliken/status/998872820523429888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One of the stranger questions for Bank of England&#39;s Carney at today&#39;s TSC- the impact over the past 5 years on the Saturday night economy of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SimonCowell?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SimonCowell</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BGT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BGT</a> (via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnMannMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JohnMannMP</a>) - Carney says a good research project but Google, social media probably more material...</p>&mdash; David Milliken (@david_milliken) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_milliken/status/998872820523429888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 22, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><em>Q: Britain has become a world leader in wind power.

Against that backdrop it was a bit of a surprise that the Bank of England then proceeded to revise their assessment for wages lower for the rest of this year, so his views on why the central bank has become less bullish on wages are likely to be important, as are Vlieghe\u2019s.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, deputy governor Ben Broadbent is not on the panel, so he won\u2019t be called to account for last week\u2019s gaffe (using the word \u2018menopause\u2019 when explaining how Britain\u2019s economy was past its peak).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2018/may/16/menopausal-how-an-ill-advised-analogy-left-the-bank-of-england-deputy-red-faced\">Menopausal: how an ill-advised analogy left the Bank of England deputy red faced</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/a-new-low-in-mansplaining-menopause-as-metaphor-for-failing-economy\">A new low in mansplaining \u2013 menopause as a metaphor for a failing economy | Catherine Bennett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Treasury Committee will kick off with a session with Gertjan Vlieghe, who is being reappointed for a second term at the MPC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CommonsTreasury/status/998805659880583170\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our first session with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bankofengland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bankofengland</a> this morning is the re-appointment of Getjan Vlieghe.

      "bodyText": "In 1975, with the UK newly in the European Union, my husband, Graham Corbett, became senior partner for Peat Marwick Continental Europe (the continental firm of what is now KPMG), a post he held for 12 years and which shaped the insights that made him a European. Graham, who has died aged 83, developed his team in Paris to show that European cooperation could function well in professional services across 14 countries. His political insight was that our continental friends and colleagues had grown up in the shadow of occupation and defeat. He understood why they saw the EU as a solution for moving on \u2013 and why Britons, undefeated in the second world war, were so often unwilling to see the bigger picture. In 1987, the then Franco-British Eurotunnel recruited him as chief financial officer. Despite the dramas of financial near-collapse, he called it his dream job. More motivating than the UK refrain \u201cyou won\u2019t get your money back\u201d was the French slogan: the tunnel construction was un pas de g\u00e9ant (a giant step). A spell in regulation followed; first he was deputy chair of the Competition Commission, then chair of the Postal Services Commission (Postcomm, now part of Ofcom). The remit to modernise via competition drove the parties involved to war with Postcomm. We would regularly wake to the headline \u201cCorbett must go\u201d. Yet eventually all parties signed an agreement, a success for the consultative strategy that he led. Graham was born in Bletchingley, Surrey, one of three sons of John Corbett, a senior partner in Peat Marwick Mitchell, and his wife, Greta (nee Sillars). His wartime childhood was spent in north Wales, where his father was seconded to the Ministry of Food to help steer the national rationing scheme. Graham was sent to school at Stowe and was politically matured by 1950s national service on Christmas Island. He was in charge of a motorised vessel monitoring fish potentially affected by radioactivity from the UK\u2019s nuclear tests in the Pacific. When Graham and I married in 1964 he was a rising accountant in Peat Marwick Mitchell, taking part in interesting jobs, such as the audit of the government of Kuwait, and playing a forthright role in the ongoing debate on accounting standards. Later he was deputy receiver on the Rolls-Royce insolvency. When Burmah Oil collapsed, he was the one to tell Denis Thatcher his services were no longer needed. In his teens Graham had suffered a spinal injury, which became debilitating when he was in his 40s. The partial paralysis, which Graham stoically refused to see as a handicap, meant an end to some of the things he had loved, such as hiking holidays and sailing. He compensated in part by chairing the Research Institute for Consumer Affairs, an organisation founded to test equipment for disabled people. He came to that world detesting the condescension that so often surrounds disability, so he put his energies, with some success, into campaigning for access for all. Graham is survived by his sons, Giles and Julian, six grandchildren and me.",

      "bodyText": "The evergreen Harry Potter franchise and the popularity of TV chef Tom Kerridge\u2019s Lose Weight for Good has driven book publisher Bloomsbury\u2019s revenue to the highest level in its 32-year history. Bloomsbury Publishing reported a 13% surge in revenues to \u00a3161.5m in the year to the end of February, its best performance since it was founded in 1986. Investors sent shares in Bloomsbury, which reported a healthy pretax profit rise of 10% to \u00a313m, up nearly 9% to their highest point since early 2007. That was the year the last of JK Rowling\u2019s original seven-part Harry Potter series was published, helping drive annual revenues to the previous record of \u00a3150m. Sales of the Harry Potter series grew 31% year-on-year, helped by special editions of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The continued popularity of the franchise helped drive sales at Bloomsbury\u2019s children\u2019s division by 24% to \u00a369m, with the publisher\u2019s biggest-selling book of the year a new illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Nigel Newton, the chief executive and co-founder of Bloomsbury, said the popularity of the boy wizard showed no sign of fading. \u201cYou could almost say that the Harry Potter series is increasing in popularity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you put aside the years that the first books were being put out \u2013 those sales will never be rivalled \u2013 sales have never been higher. \u201cThe enduring appeal of JK Rowling\u2019s writing as new generations of children come along to take up their parents\u2019 favourite book is continuing to make Harry Potter more widely read than ever.\u201d Bloomsbury said that it also saw significant success with Kerridge\u2019s Lose Weight For Good, and Sarah J Maas\u2019s A Court of Wings and Ruin. Newton said Kerridge\u2019s book set a UK record for selling the most copies in a week in January, as New Year resolutions were put into practice. \u201cWe have signed a contract for Tom\u2019s next book too. We hope it will be as big as this one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will come out in December ahead of the New Year when people are filled with worthy resolutions for health, good food and fitness.\u201d The company is continuing to receive a fillip from sales of the The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, thanks to the film version of the historical novel it first published a decade ago, starring Downton Abbey actor Lily James. Bloomsbury, which listed on the stock market in 1994, has enjoyed a share price rise of almost 30% over the last year. Newton said this was the result of a strategy to broaden the scope of the publisher\u2019s business and build digital revenues as well as academic and professional publishing operations. He said total digital revenues rose 13% to \u00a318m and that within that \u201cdigital resource sales\u201d \u2013 such as selling the Churchill archive online to academic libraries \u2013 rose 20% to \u00a34.7m. \u201cWe have been seeking for 10 years now to create a balanced portfolio between general publishing and academic and professional publishing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you see coming through in the results is that the fruits of that strategy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tesco is shutting down its clothing and homewares website Tesco Direct in a surprise move that puts 500 jobs at risk. Staff were briefed on Tuesday afternoon about the decision to close the loss-making website which was the supermarket giant\u2019s attempt to take on Argos and Amazon by selling everything from sofas to TVs and toys. Tesco admitted it couldn\u2019t see a way to make the website, which launched in 2006, profitable. As a result the retailer said approximately 500 staff were at risk of redundancy. \u201cThis decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,\u201d said Charles Wilson who recently took over as boss of Tesco\u2019s UK chain. \u201cWe want to offer our customers the ability to buy groceries and non-food products in one place and that\u2019s why we are focusing our investment into one online platform.\u201d Tesco has been running two separate internet businesses in tandem: Tesco.com for for grocery home deliveries and the Direct catalogue-style website for household goods and clothing, including its own F&amp;F brand. Tesco said the website, which will cease trading on 9 July, had struggled with the high cost of fulfilling orders and online marketing. Tesco said the plan would mean the closure of the distribution centre at Fenny Lock, Milton Keynes, which handles Tesco Direct orders. Tesco Direct was one of the many pushes launched during the expansionist reign of Sir Terry Leahy in which the retailer became a jack of all trades, with side projects that included building flats, running a bank as well as selling groceries, clothing and household goods online. Current boss Dave Lewis, who took charge in the wake of the 2014 accounting scandal, has led a radical restructuring of the UK\u2019s biggest retailer. He sold a number of businesses, including its South Korean chain Homeplus for \u00a34bn, and pushed through a programme of large-scale domestic job losses.

As a result the retailer said approximately 500 staff were at risk of redundancy.</p> <p>\u201cThis decision has been a very difficult one to make, but it is an essential step towards establishing a more sustainable non-food offer and growing our business for the future,\u201d said Charles Wilson who recently took over as boss of Tesco\u2019s UK chain. \u201cWe want to offer our customers the ability to buy groceries and non-food products in one place and that\u2019s why we are focusing our investment into one online platform.\u201d</p> <p>Tesco has been running two separate internet businesses in tandem: Tesco.com for for grocery home deliveries and the Direct catalogue-style website for household goods and clothing, including its own F&amp;F brand.</p> <p>Tesco said the website, which will cease trading on 9 July, had struggled with the high cost of fulfilling orders and online marketing. Tesco said the plan would mean the closure of the distribution centre at Fenny Lock, Milton Keynes, which handles Tesco Direct orders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tesco Direct was one of the many pushes launched during the expansionist reign of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/25/tesco-sir-terry-leahy-retires\">Sir Terry Leahy</a> in which the retailer became a jack of all trades, with side projects that included building flats, running a bank as well as selling groceries, clothing and household goods online. </p> <p>Current boss Dave Lewis, who took charge in the wake of the 2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/02/tesco-faces-150m-claim-from-shareholders-to-recoup-losses\">accounting scandal</a>, has led a radical restructuring of the UK\u2019s biggest retailer.

    "webTitle": "Nationwide's mortgage lending slumps by a third", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nationwide has reported declining profits for the second year in a row, as net mortgage lending slumped by a third amid intense competition. The UK\u2019s largest building society reported a 7.3% drop in statutory profits to \u00a3977m for the year to 4 April, down from \u00a31.05bn the previous year. Profits include the \u00a3116m cost of buying back debt. Net mortgage lending fell from \u00a38.8bn to \u00a35.8bn, and Nationwide\u2019s share of the market nearly halved, from 25.4% to 13.0%. Even so, it said it remained the UK\u2019s second-biggest mortgage lender, behind Halifax. The Swindon-based mutual blamed fierce competition that forced it to lower mortgage rates, hurting profit margins, and said there was no sign of a let-up. Mark Rennison, the Nationwide chief financial officer, said: \u201cOur view is price competition will continue, which is good news for customers.\u201d Nationwide has been hit by the end of the Bank of England\u2019s term funding scheme, which was launched after the Brexit vote to provide cheap finance to enable banks to lend at lower interest rates. Rennison said competition had increased because the big five banks had returned to the market after ringfencing their high street banking operations from the riskier parts of their businesses. The mutual\u2019s buy-to-let lending also continued to fall, after it tightened affordability criteria for landlords. Last year, Nationwide\u2019s profits tumbled 18% after it sought to protect savers from rock-bottom interest rates. It has continued to do so, holding savings rates on average more than 50% higher than the market average. As a member-owned mutual organisation, it has greater flexibility on mortgage and savings rates, unlike the large banks which have to answer to shareholders. However, savings deposits grew more slowly, up by \u00a33.5bn against a rise of \u00a35.8bn the previous year, although the group maintained its market share at 10%. Nationwide said it attracted 816,000 new current accounts, more than any other brand in the past year. It doubled student account openings to 21,000 after improving terms. The building society\u2019s membership reached a record of 15.5 million. Of those, 8.1 million are \u201cengaged\u201d members \u2013 those who have a current account, mortgage or savings deposit of more than \u00a35,000 \u2013 also a record high. Joe Garner, the Nationwide chief executive, said: \u201cWe anticipate modest growth in our core product markets, reflecting the outlook for the economy as a whole. With employment growth expected to slow and pressure on household budgets fading only gradually, mortgage lending is likely to rise at a fairly pedestrian pace.\u201d The group expects the UK economy to grow at 1% to 1.5% over the next few years and the housing market to remain subdued, with house price growth slowing to 1% over the next year. Nationwide wants to enter the business banking market and is applying for up to \u00a350m of funds from Royal Bank of Scotland, which is being forced by the government to provide \u00a3775m to rivals so they can improve their services. Garner said Nationwide would target small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) with annual turnovers of \u00a320m to \u00a325m. He said Nationwide would be \u201cthe only player in the market that has a full branch network and is targeting the smaller half of SMEs\u201d. The building society has repeatedly looked at offering business banking in the past, but was deterred by the high cost of entry. Its push into business banking comes at a time when the other large financial institutions have come under heavy criticism for their treatment of small businesses.",

The retailer has embarked on a \u201cradical transformation\u201d plan intended to tackle years of falling sales and profits. M&amp;S has confirmed the locations of only 36 store closures so far, including the identities of a further 14 sites that were revealed on Tuesday as part of the enlarged programme. The cull began 18 months ago when the chief executive, Steve Rowe, said he would slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to M&amp;S\u2019s clothing ranges. Under the expanded programmes, M&amp;S is eliminating 25% of the floor space devoted to clothing and homewares. M&amp;S has 1,035 stores in the UK, 300 of which sell clothing, homeware and food. There are around 700 Simply Food convenience stores. Sacha Berendji, the Marks &amp; Spencer retail, operations and property director, said the company was trying to make its store estate \u201cmore relevant\u201d and better able to support the growth of its website. With another 64 branches still to be earmarked for closure under the cuts, the process is creating huge uncertainty for staff. So far the programme has affected 1,500 out of 72,000 UK shop staff. \u201cClosing stores isn\u2019t easy but it is vital for the future of M&amp;S,\u201d Berendji said. \u201cWhere we have closed stores, we are seeing an encouraging number of customers moving to nearby stores \u2026 which is why we\u2019re continuing to transform our estate with pace.\u201d Three stores \u2013 Bayswater, Fleetwood outlet and Newton Abbot outlet \u2013 will close by the end of July while Holloway Road in London and Clacton-on-Sea in Essex will close by early next year as they are replaced by nearby food-only outlets. Darlington, East Kilbride, Falkirk, Kettering, Newmarket, New Mersey Speke, Northampton, Stockton and Walsall are proposed for closure and will enter a period of consultation with employees. M&amp;S said it would aim to redeploy staff before considering redundancies. M&amp;S\u2019s announcement comes as UK retailers line up a wave of closures amid tough trading conditions and rising costs. Last week Mothercare announced plans to shut 50 stores, putting at least 800 jobs at risk. Fashion chain New Look is shutting 60 outlets and House of Fraser is also planning at least 20 closures. Outside the Holloway Road store on Tuesday, which first opened its doors in 1914, shoppers reacted with shock. The once grand frontage, complete with classical pillars, is pockmarked by holes from previous signage, the windows grimy with old paint and the interior dated. But there was a steady flow of shoppers browsing the clothes as well as the food aisles. Margaret Late, 68, said she had been visiting the store for about 40 years. \u201cI come down every week but I rarely buy anything as I find it too expensive. I do like to get my underwear here and sometimes my husband\u2019s jeans but I prefer Bonmarche for clothes. It\u2019s cheaper and nicer stuff. It\u2019s a shame for M&amp;S to go, though. It will probably end up as a pound shop.\u201d Sofya Gaal, 39, said she had been using the store for most of the 22 years she has lived nearby. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame it\u2019s closing, it\u2019s probably because of online. I shop online but I like to come out to the shop and get some fresh air. I probably come here three or four times a week.\u201d The Usdaw national officer David Gill said: \u201cStaff in all M&amp;S stores were extremely concerned about what the future holds when the company announced a wide-ranging store reorganisation in November 2016. \u201cAt the time they did not say where the axe will fall by detailing which stores are set to close,\u201d said Gill. \u201cToday we\u2019ve seen a third wave of closures announced, which is devastating news for the staff in those stores and the uncertainty continues for everyone else. This salami slicing approach to reorganising the business is extremely distressing for the staff.\u201d On Wednesday M&amp;S is expected to report pretax profits of \u00a3573m, down from \u00a3614m in 2017, marking the second consecutive year of declining profits and falling well short of the peak of \u00a31bn reported in 2008. Sales of clothing and home products at established stores are forecast to be down 1.1%, and food sales down 0.2%. One retail consultancy said M&amp;S was in danger of losing its crown as the UK\u2019s largest clothing retailer. \u2018\u2018Marks &amp; Spencer has dominated the UK clothing market for decades, but its lead as number one is perilously close to being lost to Primark this year,\u201d said Maureen Hinton, a research director at GlobalData. \u201cThe closure of yet more stores will hasten the decline unless it can shift the lost sales to its online channel and transfer to its other stores.\u201d In 1997 M&amp;S achieved its peak clothing market share of 13.5% in the UK but the past two decades have seen the lead chipped away to 7.6% just ahead of Primark on 7%, according to figures from GlobalData.",

      "bodyText": "At the age of 46, DeWayne Johnson is not ready to die. But with cancer spread through most of his body, doctors say he probably has just months to live. Now Johnson, a husband and father of three in California, hopes to survive long enough to make Monsanto take the blame for his fate. On 18 June, Johnson will become the first person to take the global seed and chemical company to trial on allegations that it has spent decades hiding the cancer-causing dangers of its popular Roundup herbicide products \u2013 and his case has just received a major boost. Last week Judge Curtis Karnow issued an order clearing the way for jurors to consider not just scientific evidence related to what caused Johnson\u2019s cancer, but allegations that Monsanto suppressed evidence of the risks of its weed killing products. Karnow ruled that the trial will proceed and a jury would be allowed to consider possible punitive damages. \u201cThe internal correspondence noted by Johnson could support a jury finding that Monsanto has long been aware of the risk that its glyphosate-based herbicides are carcinogenic \u2026 but has continuously sought to influence the scientific literature to prevent its internal concerns from reaching the public sphere and to bolster its defenses in products liability actions,\u201d Karnow wrote. \u201cThus there are triable issues of material fact.\u201d Johnson\u2019s case, filed in San Francisco county superior court in California, is at the forefront of a legal fight against Monsanto. Some 4,000 plaintiffs have sued Monsanto alleging exposure to Roundup caused them, or their loved ones, to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Another case is scheduled for trial in October, in Monsanto\u2019s home town of St Louis, Missouri. The lawsuits challenge Monsanto\u2019s position that its herbicides are proven safe and assert that the company has known about the dangers and hidden them from regulators and the public. The litigants cite an assortment of research studies indicating that the active ingredient in Monsanto\u2019s herbicides, a chemical called glyphosate, can lead to NHL and other ailments. They also cite research showing glyphosate formulations in its commercial-end products are more toxic than glyphosate alone. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in 2015. Monsanto \u201cchampioned falsified data and attacked legitimate studies\u201d that revealed dangers of its herbicides, and led a \u201cprolonged campaign of misinformation\u201d to convince government agencies, farmers and consumers that Roundup was safe, according to Johnson\u2019s lawsuit. \u201cWe look forward to exposing how Monsanto hid the risk of cancer and polluted the science,\u201d said Michael Miller, Johnson\u2019s attorney. \u201cMonsanto does not want the truth about Roundup and cancer to become public.\u201d Monsanto has fiercely denied the allegations, saying its products are not the cause of cancer. The IARC finding was wrong, according to Monsanto, as are studies finding glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides like Roundup to be potentially carcinogenic. Monsanto points to findings by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory authorities as backing its defense. \u201cGlyphosate-based herbicides are supported by one of the most extensive worldwide human health and environmental effects databases ever compiled for a pesticide product,\u201d Monsanto states on its website. \u201cComprehensive toxicological and environmental fate studies conducted over the last 40 years have time and again demonstrated the strong safety profile of this widely used herbicide.\u201d A company spokeswoman did not respond to a request for additional comment. How the Johnson lawsuit plays out could be a bellwether for how other plaintiffs proceed. If Johnson prevails, there could be many more years of costly litigation and hefty damage claims. If Monsanto successfully turns back the challenge, it could derail other cases and lift pressure on the firm. According to the court record, Johnson had a job as a groundskeeper for the Benicia unified school district where he applied numerous treatments of Monsanto\u2019s herbicides to school properties from 2012 until at least late 2015. He was healthy and active before he got the cancer diagnosis in August 2014. In a January deposition, Johnson\u2019s treating physician testified that more than 80% of his body was covered by lesions, and that he probably had but a few months to live. Johnson has improved since starting a new drug treatment in November but remains too weak sometimes to even speak or get out of bed, his attorneys and doctors state in court filings. Monsanto\u2019s lawyers plan to introduce evidence that other factors caused Johnson\u2019s cancer, to challenge the validity of the science Johnson\u2019s claims rely on, and to present their own experts and research supporting safety. The company has an EPA draft risk assessment of glyphosate on its side, which concludes that glyphosate is not likely carcinogenic.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair cancelled thousands of flights last year, insulted its pilots but then was forced to recognise their unions, and generally generated an above-average level of bad publicity, even by its own elevated standards. The financial effect of the disharmony? Roughly zero. At the after-tax level, profits rose 10% to \u20ac1.45bn (\u00a31.27bn). Indeed, the most eye-catching development in Monday\u2019s full-year statement was Ryanair\u2019s new habit of referring to its passengers as \u201cguests\u201d, which is the wrong word for paying customers but may be another of Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s little jokes. Despite Ryanair\u2019s resilience in the 12 months to March, the chief executive said he was \u201con the pessimistic side of cautious\u201d about this year, which he is obliged to say because oil prices, and thus jet fuel prices, are rising and Ryanair must absorb the full-year costs of the pay rises for staff that it was shamed into awarding. Even so, O\u2019Leary\u2019s version of pessimism doesn\u2019t look so awful. He still expects profits to arrive between \u20ac1.25bn to \u20ac1.35bn, which is hardly a collapse. It is possible because the customers keep coming and, for all the turmoil, Ryanair\u2019s business model is not seriously imperilled. Staff costs will rise by almost \u20ac200m this year, but only half that sum represents higher pay for \u201cfrontline\u201d staff \u2013 the rest is the natural effect of expansion. Ryanair may suffer a few strikes (Spain and Ireland are the current focus) but, if \u20ac100m is the cost of relative peace in the ranks, that\u2019s not a bad result for the company. Ryanair will remain Europe\u2019s lowest-cost operator. Brexit, as ever, is another of O\u2019Leary\u2019s complaints but he may have found a solution to the problem of how to meet EU ownership rules for airlines \u2013 if necessary, just disenfranchise non-EU investors from voting on shareholder resolutions. The shares rose 5%, suggesting shareholders are happy-ish again. O\u2019Leary ought to be more perky than he sounds. By rights, the shambles of last year\u2019s cancellations should have prompted serious pressure to reform a boardroom lineup that looks too cosy. Instead, he seems to be in the clear again. Retail winners irked at a system that favours losers A backlash against company voluntary arrangements, or CVAs, was only a matter of time. A system that allows a struggling store or restaurant group to escape collapse by asking its landlords for a big reduction in rent is clearly useful in protecting jobs and giving companies a shot at saving themselves, but CVAs also seem fundamentally unfair on rivals. If landlords are happy to hand out rent reduction, why should retailing winners not get prizes? It\u2019s no surprise that Next, as reported by the Sunday Times, is now lobbying for \u201cCVA clauses\u201d to be included in the new lease contracts so it can enjoy the same benefit if a direct competitor on a high street or retail park, or in a shopping centre, gets a helping hand from a landlord. From Next\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s another way to reduce its rent bill and extend the life of profitable shops in the age of internet shopping. In its last full-year results, the Next chief executive, Lord Wolfson, reported that leases on 19 stores had been renewed with net rents falling by an average of 28%. He was expecting a similar outcome from renegotiations on 29 stores this year. In his shoes, you can understand why he would be irritated if rivals can sometimes get 50% cuts by threatening to go bust. It\u2019s hard to see how landlords can resist the pressure from operators with strong covenants. Yes, landlords can complain \u2013 legitimately \u2013 that internet-only retailers like Amazon are grossly undertaxed in terms of business rates. But CVAs have become normal only because landlords have embraced them as a least-bad option to minimise the short-term pain for themselves of empty shops. In a retail property market where healthy tenants now hold more aces, there were bound to be long-term consequences. Italy\u2019s government bond yield won\u2019t cow the populist coalition The yield on 10-year Italian government debt has risen from 1.8% at the start of this month to 2.39%, prompting some to assert that the market has spoken and the new populist coalition won\u2019t dare to pick a fight with the EU over fiscal rules. This sounds like wishful thinking. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the far-right League might point out that yields were 7% in 2012 in the depths of the eurozone debt crisis. They might draw the conclusion that their big spending plans are going down rather well, all things considered. If bond market vigilantes want to send a message, they will have to throw a proper tantrum: 2.39% probably doesn\u2019t even register on the populists\u2019 radar.",

      "bodyText": "Business leaders around the globe have said the rise of economic nationalism triggered by Brexit, Donald Trump and populist politics poses the greatest threat to their growth. According to a survey of 1,300 chief executives from some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, carried out by the accountancy company KPMG, British business leaders are notably more pessimistic than their peers. Two-thirds of UK CEOs said they were most worried about the growing use of protectionism, which includes measures such as tariffs and quotas on imports, compared with just over half of their international counterparts. Such barriers have the potential to protect jobs in the countries that put up trade barriers, but business leaders argue the benefits are outweighed by higher prices for consumers. Bill Michael, UK chair at KPMG, said: \u201cIf world trade doors continue to close, there will be an inevitable impact on global growth. This persistent retrenchment is of huge concern to the business leaders I speak to.\u201d The warnings come after China and the US stepped back from a potential trade war that could have had damaging repercussions for the global economy. Washington agreed to put \u201con hold\u201d proposed tariffs on Chinese imports, as the two sides said they had reached \u201ca consensus on taking effective measures\u201d to cut the US trade deficit in goods with China. Financial markets rallied after the statement on Monday, helping to push the FTSE 100 to a record high. However, the prospect of an Italian coalition government forming at odds with the EU establishment may threaten to unsettle stock markets. Most chief executives in the KPMG survey of 150 UK business leaders and 1,150 from elsewhere around the world said geopolitical risks, regulations and investment in technology would trigger slow growth for their companies over the coming year. European business leaders have become increasingly pessimistic in recent months, despite some of the progress being made in the Brexit talks. According to a study of chief financial officers by the accountancy company Deloitte, 12% said they were less optimistic about the prospects for their business, up from 11% in the autumn. Half said they were experiencing a high level of financial and economic uncertainty, while business leaders in the UK had the gloomiest outlook in the survey of 1,652 chief financial officers from across Europe. British companies had the lowest investment intentions of those from any of the 20 EU nations in the study. Ian Stewart, the chief UK economist at Deloitte, said: \u201cEurope\u2019s recovery saw a slight loss of momentum in the first quarter, with CFO optimism and revenue expectations nudging lower. But outside the UK, businesses are upbeat about spending and hiring.\u201d",

However, the prospect of an Italian coalition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/21/italy-populist-coalition-set-to-name-political-novice-as-pm-nominee\">government forming</a> at odds with the EU establishment may threaten to unsettle stock markets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/21/italy-populist-coalition-set-to-name-political-novice-as-pm-nominee\">Italian markets in turmoil as political novice emerges as frontrunner to be PM</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most chief executives in the KPMG survey of 150 UK business leaders and 1,150 from elsewhere around the world said geopolitical risks, regulations and investment in technology would trigger slow growth for their companies over the coming year. </p> <p>European business leaders have become increasingly pessimistic in recent months, despite some of the progress being made in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/21/tracking-lorries-irish-border-issue-hauliers-david-davis\">Brexit talks</a>. According to a study of chief financial officers by the accountancy company Deloitte, 12% said they were less optimistic about the prospects for their business, up from 11% in the autumn. </p> <p>Half said they were experiencing a high level of financial and economic uncertainty, while business leaders in the UK had the gloomiest outlook in the survey of 1,652 chief financial officers from across Europe. British companies had the lowest investment intentions of those from any of the 20 EU nations in the study. </p> <p>Ian Stewart, the chief UK economist at Deloitte, said: \u201cEurope\u2019s recovery saw a slight loss of momentum in the first quarter, with CFO optimism and revenue expectations nudging lower. But outside the UK, businesses are upbeat about spending and hiring.\u201d</p>",
