      "bodyText": "Verizon Communications and unions representing nearly 40,000 wireline workers have reached a tentative deal to end a strike that has stretched for more than month, the US secretary of labor, Thomas Perez, said on Friday. The strike, one of the largest in recent years, drew the support of Democratic US presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Shares in Verizon, the No 1 US wireless company, jumped as much as 1.2% after the announcement and in afternoon trading were up almost 1% at $50.62. \u201cThe parties are now working to reduce the agreement to writing, after which the proposal will be submitted to CWA and IBEW union members for ratification,\u201d Perez said in a statement. He added that workers will be back on their jobs next week. After striking for 44 days, striking workers described the tentative agreement as a victory with \u201cbig gains\u201d. \u201cThe addition of new, middle-class jobs at Verizon is a huge win not just for striking workers, but for our communities and our country as a whole. The agreement in principle at Verizon is a victory for working families across the country and an affirmation of the power of working people,\u201d said Chris Shelton, president of the Communications Workers of America. Network technicians and customer service representatives in the company\u2019s Fios internet, telephone and television services units walked off the job on 13 April after contract talks hit an impasse. The action was called by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Sticking points in contract negotiations had included job relocations, offshoring call-center jobs, pensions and healthcare coverage. The workers had been without a contract since their agreement expired in August. Their healthcare coverage ran out at the end of April. The last contract negotiations in 2011 also led to a strike that ended in two weeks, as the parties continued contract negotiations. This time around, Verizon Communications and representatives from the two striking unions had been in contract discussions with the help of the US Department of Labor. In mid-May, Perez brought both parties back to the negotiating table. The work stoppage at Verizon stretched across several US east coast states, including New York, Massachusetts and Virginia. Verizon said it had trained thousands of non-union employees over the past year to ensure no service disruption. Since the strike started the workers picketed outside Verizon stores and a handful of conferences attended by company executives. Verizon plans to report second-quarter results on 26 July. Company executives have hinted in recent weeks that the strike could pressure the bottom line. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of installations, but we\u2019re not doing the same volume that we had before,\u201d Lowell McAdamm, Verizon chief executive officer and chairman, said on Tuesday at the JP Morgan Technology, Media and Telecom conference in Boston. \u201cSo we won\u2019t be driving similar numbers in second quarter that we would in first from an installation perspective.\u201d Fran Shammo, Verizon\u2019s chief financial officer, also said new installations and orders had \u201csignificantly dropped\u201d. Barry Sine, telecom analyst with Drexel, Hamilton &amp; Co, estimated that the strike could cost Verizon as much $200m in profits \u2013 equivalent to a nickel a share. Verizon has shifted its focus in recent years to new efforts in mobile video and advertising, while scaling back its Fios TV and internet service. The company has stopped expanding its old landline phone network and the wireline unit generated about 29% of company revenue in 2015, down about 60% since 2000.

      "bodyText": "Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen had a message for Wall Streeters anxiously wanting to depart for the long weekend on Friday: interest rate hikes are coming. Analysts have been scrutinizing remarks by all Federal Reserve officials over the past few months for a hunt of when the next interest rate hike might occur. The US central bank is expected to announce two to three interest rate hikes this year after it increased rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. \u201cI have been told that a bunch of money managers in New York have delayed their trip to the Hamptons this afternoon, so that they could listen to you talk here today in case you move markets,\u201d Greg Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard University, told Yellen to laughter from audience. \u201cSo this is your chance to move markets. Do you want to tell us anything about the monetary policy going forward?\u201d \u201cLet me say a few sentences so I won\u2019t delay them very long,\u201d said Yellen, to more laughter. She pointed out that the economy is continuing to improve despite the weak growth reported in the first quarter. On Friday morning, hours before Yellen\u2019s Q&amp;A session, the US commerce department revised up its gross domestic product figured for the first quarter. US GDP \u2013 the broadest measure of the health of the economy \u2013 rose at 0.8% instead of the 0.5% reported last month. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently estimating second-quarter GDP rising at a 2.9% rate. Yellen, too, said that she expects GDP to pick up and the labor market to continue to improve. The Fed will continue to monitor incoming data and will asses the risks to the outlook, she said. While she did not mention what those risks are, the Fed had previously focused on risks posed by Britain\u2019s potential exit from the European Union, \u201cBrexit\u201d, and by the lingering uncertainty over China\u2019s economy. Yellen also pointed out that the unemployment rate is nearing full employment, labor participation has increased in the past few months, and that oil prices and dollar depreciation, which can influence inflation, have both stabilized. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate \u2013 and I have said this in the past, I think \u2013 for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time,\u201d said Yellen, adding: \u201cProbably in the coming months such a move would be appropriate.\u201d A day before Yellen\u2019s speech, Jerome Powell, a Federal Reserve governor who is a voting members of the Fed\u2019s policy setting committee, said that the economy is on a \u201csolid footing\u201d but that he has not yet decided whether he will support raising interest rates when the Fed meets on 14-15 June. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wait too long, but neither do you want to be in a hurry,\u201d he explained, adding that the risks of waiting to raise rates were \u201cnot that great\u201d. Yellen has previously warned that waiting to raise interest rates too long might lead to inflation bubbling over. If there is too much uncertainty mid-June about whether to raise interest rates \u2013 due to Brexit vote or other economic data, the Fed is scheduled to meet again six week later in July, John William, San Francisco Fed President, pointed out earlier this month. Yellen also warned against raising interest rates too steeply on Friday, noting that the Fed has limited tools to respond to another economic crisis. \u201cIf we were to raise interest rates too steeply and we were to trigger a downturn, we have limited scope for responding and this is an important reason for caution,\u201d she said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "So there you have it and the traders from New York can now go off to the Hamptons. While not specifically mentioning a June rise, she did say it would probably be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to gradually raise rates in the coming months. But she urged caution and warned of hiking rates too steeply. As a consequence the dollar has moved higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. And now the key question. She is told that a New York money brokers are delaying their weekend trip to the Hamptons to see if she says anything market moving. So here is her chance to move markets (laughter) so can she say anything about the path of monetary policy? Yellen: The economy is continuing to improve, we saw weak growth in first quarter of year. It looks to be picking up from data we monitor... We will monitor incoming data and risks. It\u2019s appropriate for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time. In coming months such a move would be appropriate. On negative interest rates, we considered it briefly. There could be a number of negative repercussions so we didn\u2019t pursue it and it\u2019s not something we are thinking about now. But other countries are using it. So we have to be cautious. If we were to raise interest rates too quickly and we trigger a downturn we have limited scope to respond. We should be cautious about raising rates too steeply. On the economy, she says it has been a slow recovery but we have made a great deal of progress. We have created 14m new jobs since lowest point for employment. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress. That said, further gains are possible, we\u2019ve not seen much improvement in wage growth. But the growth of output has been remarkably slow. We have a lot of jobs being created in the face of not much output, so that means productivity growth is quite slow. With respect to inflation, it has been running below the Fed\u2019s 2% objective for a number of years. There are a number of reasons, the plunge in oil price, a marked depreciation of the dollar pushing down import prices. These seem to have stablised, and if we continue to see stability, inflationwill move over next couple of years to near target. Yellen says they are trying to be better at spotting financial instabilities, and they have a better process for doing that. Yellen is praising her predecessor Ben Bernanke for being brave during the financial crisis, but she admits they did not see the crisis coming. Bloomberg has a better feed here. Janet Yellen is now on stage at the Radcliffe Institute where the chair of the Federal Reserve is being given the Radcliffe Medal, \u201cpresented annually to an individual who has had a transformative impact on society.\u201d Of course the big interest is what - if anything -she might say about a June rate hike, given the suggestions from a number of Fed members in recent days that such a move may be on the cards. At the moment she is being asked about her background and general comments about economics. A link to the discussion (albeit a bit sporadic) is here. The Russian president Vladimir Putin was quick to stamp the tone on his two-day visit as he begun talks with the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, reports Helena Smith: \u201cIn Moscow and St Petersburg we have discussed our prospects of economic collaboration in detail. Of course there are many problems and times are difficult but for sure there are good prospects,\u201d said Putin. \u201cWe have to transform the good relations of [our] two peoples into tangible economic results.\u201d Greece and Russia, fellow Orthodox states, with a common heritage that goes back to Byzantium have hailed 2016 to be a \u201cyear of Greek-Russian friendship.\u201d Putin, who is travelling with nine ministers, is expected to sign an array of agreements with Athens\u2019 leftist-led government. Energy and tourism are expected to be high on the agenda. Tourist-dependent Greece is hungry for Russian holiday makers and industry figures have complained bitterly about the slow pace with which visas have been made available to them by the Greek state machinery - not least diplomatic services in Russia itself. Athens\u2019 governing left wing Syriza party has spoken stridently about the need to create a \u201cmulti-faceted\u201d foreign policy - one which will see the country furthering relations with China, Russia, Iran and Latin America. \u201cWe are trying to open up what used to be a very narrow western looking diplomatic attidude,\u201d the country\u2019s culture minister Aristides Baltas, a leading Syriza ideologue, told me. \u201cWe want to remain in Europe but not in the sense of being the obedient servants of the west,\u201d he said, adding that Greece, as an EU member state, had been obliged to follow the embargo against Russia even if didn\u2019t agree with it. Back in Greece and words of welcome for president Putin from the country\u2019s prime minister: As for Putin himself: There\u2019s no disguising the fact it was a pretty quiet day all round on European stock markets as the week drifted to a close. With investors unwilling to commit themselves ahead of comments from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen later - albeit there is little expectation of any real hints on interest rates - there was little to disturb the horses. Even the upward revision to US first quarter GDP passed without much impact. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 5.14 points or 0.08% at 6270.79 Germany\u2019s Dax was virtually unchanged, edging up 0.13% to 10,286.31 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.05% ahead at 4514.74 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.17% to 18,186.14 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.31% at 9107.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.33% to 636.83 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 34 points or 0.19%. In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority said it was investigating the \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos owner Home Retail by supermarket group Sainsbury. It said it would be looking at whether the deal would hurt competition in the UK, and it would announce its decision by 25 July. Back with the US GDP figures, and we could be looking at a weak figure for the second quarter according to Markit: And here\u2019s Russian president Putin arriving in Greece: American consumers are more confident in May than they were in April, but the latest survey has still come in lower than analysts had been forecasting. The University of Michigan\u2019s final index of consumer sentiment for May was up from 89 in April to 94.7. But this was lower that the preliminary estimate of 95.8 and below the consensus of 95.4. Meanwhile in Greece: (See our preview earlier) Investors are keeping their powder dry ahead of the remarks later from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, with the latest GDP revisions doing little to lift the mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.12% and Nasdaq just 0.09%. And here\u2019s how the US slowdown looks: A US interest rate rise in the next two months is unnecessary, given the uncertainty over the country\u2019s economy evidenced by the revised first quarter GDP figures, suggest the CEBR. It said: We still expect the remaining three quarters of 2016 to make up for the first quarter slowdown. Despite the seasonal adjustment process, first quarter GDP data are often unreliable and overly gloomy due to seasonal factors such as winter weather. Our view is also supported by consistently strong job creation figures and a rebound in consumer confidence. Consumer sentiment saw an uptick in May due to a strong labour market showing and expectations that both inflation and interest rates would remain low. However, the chances that interest rates will remain lower for longer are slimmer now than they were earlier this month...The minutes from the [latest Federal Open Markets Committee] meeting, and statements made by Federal Reserve officials since, indicate that some FOMC members believe that the US labour market is at full employment and that this may start putting upward pressure on inflation. Another, less official, consideration may be the US presidential election taking place in November. In the past the Fed has been reluctant to indirectly weigh into political debates and raising interest rates too close to the election would be interpreted as a signal regarding the institution\u2019s opinion of economic prospects. Therefore, while the FOMC\u2019s interest rate decision in June will be data-dependant, it may also be impacted by the realisation that if interest rates do not rise in June or July, they are very likely to remain at 0.5% until at least December. Cebr believes that raising rates in June or July is premature and unnecessary. The inflationary environment remains benign and the US economy still faces numerous risks on the global front. Lacklustre growth in export markets is already creating problems for the country\u2019s exporters. Further strengthening the US dollar via monetary policy tightening would make US-made products relatively more expensive and therefore less desirable for foreign buyers. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco said: The question is how this affects the odds on a Fed rate hike this summer? As far as the markets are concerned, not very much so far although it certainly keeps the prospect alive. However, it\u2019s unlikely investors will want to take on additional exposure ahead of Janet Yellen\u2019s public appearance this evening and the long holiday weekend. Whether the Fed Chair says anything related to monetary policy is another matter altogether. What should prove far more significant is next week\u2019s raft of manufacturing PMIs along with the latest US Non-Farm Payroll release. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Yesterday\u2019s durable goods orders and home sales data would have put a smile on the face of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, but today\u2019s underwhelming first quarter GDP report is unlikely to be as well-received. It\u2019s not the most positive start to the financial year for the US and observers will now be keen to see if momentum can pick up in the next quarter. There\u2019s plenty of talk about an interest rate rise, but Yellen and Co. are likely to wait for the data to support it before pushing the button. Despite the revision, the figures show a slowdown in GDP compared to the fourth quarter which saw a 1.4% increase. The overall figure was lifted by spending on home building and an increase in inventory investment by businesses. The US economy grew more than originally thought in the first quarter, but less than some economists had been expecting. As various members of the Federal Reserve suggested that a rate hike in June was not off the table, official figures showed an annualised 0.8% rise in GDP in the three months to March. This was higher than the first estimate of 0.5% but below estimates of a rise of 0.9%. This really has been dullest morning in the City for a while. Our old friend, the FTSE 100, is refusing to show any enthusiasm and is currently down a meagre 4 points. Investors are hoping that the US growth figures, in around 40 minutes, might cause a stir. Remember, economists expect the annualised growth rate in the last quarter to be revised up to 0.9%, from 0.4% before. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx (who gets a bonus mark for keeping awake, frankly), says: Friday continued at an alarmingly dull pace this morning, though there is the chance for a bit of excitement from the US open later this afternoon. The FTSE plodded along flat on the day, with the DAX and CAC effectively following the UK index\u2019s lead. Both regions had nothing in the way of data to offer this Friday, and with Brent Crude threatening to fall below $49 per barrel were lacking the recent commodity-buzz that has helped push the indices to 3 week highs. Greece is prepares to welcome Russian president Vladimir Putin, amid tight security and fears that the visit will cause ructions within the EU. Putin\u2019s visit is billed as a way of deepening economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries. He\u2019ll be discussing trade, energy and transport issues, and meeting with President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Putin has already signalled that Moscow wants closer links with Athens, as the Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: Moscow is primarily interested in buying state-run railway operator Trainose and a stake in Thessaloniki port, the country\u2019s second largest, as Putin reiterated in a commentary for Kathimerini published on Thursday ahead of the visit. He also said that Russia \u2013 Greece\u2019s main gas supplier \u2013 is still very much interested in reviving the South Stream gas pipeline project. \u201cThe issue of our energy resources being carried through southern corridors to the countries of the European Union is still on the agenda,\u201d Putin said But the sight of Russia\u2019s president landing in Athens at a time when the EU is imposing sanctions is causing some concern. Daragh McDowell, a principal analyst for Europe and Central Asia at Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC that Putin hopes to take advantage of anger within Greece about its years of austerity. \u201cThe extreme political and economic disruption Greece has experienced, in combination with existing cultural ties, make it a particularly attractive target for these kind of initiatives. \u201cFundamentally these overtures are about sowing division and discord among the EU states in order to undermine the sanctions regime and, over the longer term, the EU as a whole.\u201d Resolution\u2019s Duncan Weldon has now blogged about the IMF paper on the problems with neoliberal economics. He explains that it\u2019s part of a wider change of thinking at the Fund, away from the \u201cWashington consensus\u201d that dominated thinking before the wheels came off the global economy in 2008. But the IMF is also pointing out the flaws in the policies implemented over the last eight years. Duncan argues that the criticism against austerity is understandable : Excessive fiscal tightening in countries that still have fiscal space simply hasn\u2019t worked as promised. There are plenty of countries with ample fiscal space that haven\u2019t used it and the world economy has suffered as a result. And the Fund\u2019s comments on capital controls reflect its concerns that ultra-loose monetary policy in the US and Europe has a severe impact on emerging markets. If The Fed won\u2019t care about spillover effects, developing countries must take more precautions. In this respect the Fund; move towards backing capital controls is a consequences of the failure of Western fiscal policy makers to do enough to support growth and the unwillingness of Western monetary policy makers to take into account the global consequences of their actions. Jonathan Ostry, the IMF economist who co-wrote its critique of neoliberalism, is hoping to trigger a new debate about economic orthodoxy. The Financial Times has the details: In an interview, Jonathan Ostry, deputy director of the IMF\u2019s research department and the article\u2019s lead author, said the new piece was not meant as an attack on \u201cthe entire neoliberal agenda or the Washington consensus\u201d. But he hoped it would set the stage for a broader examination of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d that would come out this year. It also fitted, he argued, with work on everything from austerity and inequality to debt and the desirability of open capital accounts that he and others have been publishing since the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 and with a growing sentiment in the broader economics community. \u201cThere are a lot of people thinking the same thing at this point, that basically some aspects of the neoliberal agenda probably need a rethink,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crisis said: \u2018The way we\u2019ve been thinking can\u2019t be right\u2019.\u201d Financial Times: IMF economists put \u2018neoliberalism\u2019 under the spotlight Neoliberal economics has attracted plenty of critics over the years, as the impact of privatisations, shrinking the state and austerity measures has become clear. And now, a team at the International Monetary Fund have delivered a remarkable attack on the consequences of neoliberalism. In a new paper they argue that the benefits of neoliberal policies has been over-blown, and its damage has been underplayed by policymakers. They put their finger on two key issues \u2013 the impact of capital flows into emerging markets, and the austerity measures and fiscal tightening forced on governments. They conclude that neoliberalism simply hasn\u2019t worked as well as supporters claim, and has created inequality that actually hurt growth. Here\u2019s their key conclusions: The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries. The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda. Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects. This won\u2019t surprise those who have lived through the eurozone debt crisis, or previous economic perils. But it does highlight that some global policymakers are trying to learn from the mistakes of the past. The paper suggests that capital controls, once seen as a thoroughly bad thing, might actually have helped avoid causing economic problems. The IMF team even takes aim at the notion that running a budget surplus is a bright idea, asking: Is there really a defensible case for countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, or the United States to pay down the public debt? And they argue it\u2019s probably not, because: Austerity policies not only generate substantial welfare costs due to supply-side channels, they also hurt demand\u2014and thus worsen employment and unemployment. The piece does state that neoliberalism has had its benefits; global trade has lifted millions out of abject poverty, for example, while some privatisations have delivered better services. But even so, \u201cthere are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected\u2019. Here\u2019s the full piece: Neoliberalism: Oversold? Activist Naomi Klein points out that the damage has already been done: While economist Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Foundation argues that the IMF really is changing: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets wonder if Yellen might play it cool at Harvard: In focus today will likely be Fed Chair Yellen\u2019s speech after the European close, especially after her colleagues (mostly non-voters) were out in force this week swaying expectations about a Summer rate hike. Note, however, Yellen is only receiving an award from Harvard so may well swerve explicit mention of US monetary policy to avoid adding fuel to the fire. Janet Yellen\u2019s comments may not come until around 5.30pm BST, or later. She\u2019s due to speak at a lunch at Harvard, along with her predecessor Ben Bernanke. More details here. Janet Yellen could move the markets today, when she visits Harvard to collect the Radcliffe Medal in recognition of her work. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors will be watching the Fed chair closely, for any hints that a rate hike could be close. Sentiment towards the US economy has improved this month with an impressive array of domestic data bolstering speculation that US rates could be increased in June or July. With retail sales, inflation and new homes sales exceeding forecasts, the prerequisites for another US rate hike in Q2 could be fulfilled if US GDP and next week\u2019s NFP exceed expectations. Yellen\u2019s comments could act as a catalyst today for Dollar bulls to rampage if she chants the same hawkish tune as the other board governors. Although the CME group Fedwatch tool displays a 26% probability that a June hike could occur, concerns over slowing global growth and persistent China woes may also disrupt the Fed\u2019s efforts to take action. Europe\u2019s stock markets are open, but frankly there\u2019s little happening out there. The main indices are all broadly unchanged, as investors wait for the US growth figures at 1.30pm BST. Some traders may also be pondering the long weekend (there\u2019s a bank holiday on Monday), or wondering how England will fare against Sri Lanka in the Test Match (probably rather well). Mining shares are leading the risers in London, where the FTSE has managed to rise by 3 whole points. Tony Cross of TrustNet Direct explains: Commodity stocks are still finding favour, helped in no small part by US dollar weakness amidst the idea that the Fed may not be in a position to hike rates next month as had been earlier thought. A glimmer of good news from across the Channel. French consumer confidence has hit its highest level since October 2007, when the world economy was reeling from the credit crunch. The country\u2019s main consumer confidence gauge has jumped to 98 in May, which beats economists\u2019 expectations of 95. That\u2019s tantalising close to the long-term consumer confidence average of 100. I do wonder, though, whether the clashes on the streets this week will hurt confidence. Tens of thousands of people have been protesting against legislation to make it easier to both hire and fire workers, prompting clashes with riot police yesterday. My colleague Angelique Chrisafis explains: Striking French workers continued to disrupt oil refineries and nuclear power stations, halted some air traffic and trains and prevented almost all national newspapers from printing in the growing industrial action. Union activists blocked roads and bridges in northern France while some train drivers and air traffic controllers joined the action. World leaders at the G7 meeting in Tokyo have declared that global growth is their \u201curgent priority\u201d, but not actually announced any new measures to deal with it. The official declaration following the meeting declares: Global growth remains moderate and below potential, while risks of weak growth persist..... They then warn that growth is \u201cmoderate and uneven\u201d, while global trade is disappointing. David Cameron, the UK PM, has also managed to get a reference to next month\u2019s EU referendum into the communique. Leaders have agreed that Brexit would harm international trade, and is a \u201cfurther serious risk\u201d to growth. Japan\u2019s stock market has gained ground today, following reports that prime minister Shinzo Abe is considering postponing one of his flagship policies. Abe dropped a broad hint earlier today that the planned hike in sales tax could be delayed. This tax was a crucial part of Abe\u2019s attempts to improve Japan\u2019s financial situation, but with the economy weak and inflation low, a rethink could be on the cards. Abe told a press conference at the G7 meeting that: \u201cWe must reignite powerfully the engine of Abenomics. That undoubtedly would include a decision on what to do with the sales tax hike.\u201d A postponement probably would help consumer confidence and economic growth. However, it would undermine Abe\u2019s commitment to improving Japan\u2019s troubling fiscal position (a national debt of more than 200% of GDP). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Friday, and it\u2019s a bit quiet. But there are still a few events coming up that might get the blood pumping. Investors are mainly waiting for the second estimate of America\u2019s growth in the first three months of the year, at 1.30pm BST. The first estimate was pretty dire, showing that growth slowed to an annual rate of just 0.4%. But with more data now available, economists believe we could get an upgrade to perhaps 0.9%. That\u2019s still only a quarterly rate of around 0.2%, but it would calm fears that the US economy was faltering. All US data is currently seen through the lens of monetary policy, and whether it\u2019s strong enough to prompt an interest rate rise soon. America\u2019s top central banker, Janet Yellen, might have something to say about that when she visits Harvard (where she taught in the early 1970s). RBS Capital Markets explains: Yellen speaks at Harvard\u2019s Radcliffe Day, where she will engage in \u201ca conversation about her groundbreaking achievements.\u201d The widespread expectation is, of course, that she will reiterate the more hawkish line taken by almost all recent Fed speakers. That event begins at 3.30pm BST, or 10.30am local time. Otherwise, the economics calendar is as bare as Old Mother Hubbard\u2019s cupboard before payday. But we\u2019ll also keep one eye on Japan, where the G7 leaders meeting is wrapping up. Our G7 liveblog is here: The other eye will be on Greece, where Russian president Vladimir Putin is paying a visit to Athens (having been blackballed from the G7) . This trip will is likely to reignite concerns in Brussels that Moscow could be using austerity-gripped Greece as a lever to divide Europe. Officially, the visit will deliver a \u201cnumber of bilateral agreements\u201d and will focus on trade, investment and joint energy and transport projects. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day (and hoping the newsflow picks up a bit)",

It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We still expect the remaining three quarters of 2016 to make up for the first quarter slowdown. Despite the seasonal adjustment process, first quarter GDP data are often unreliable and overly gloomy due to seasonal factors such as winter weather. Our view is also supported by consistently strong job creation figures and a rebound in consumer confidence. Consumer sentiment saw an uptick in May due to a strong labour market showing and expectations that both inflation and interest rates would remain low. </p> <p>However, the chances that interest rates will remain lower for longer are slimmer now than they were earlier this month...The minutes from the [latest Federal Open Markets Committee] meeting, and statements made by Federal Reserve officials since, indicate that some FOMC members believe that the US labour market is at full employment and that this may start putting upward pressure on inflation. </p> <p>Another, less official, consideration may be the US presidential election taking place in November. In the past the Fed has been reluctant to indirectly weigh into political debates and raising interest rates too close to the election would be interpreted as a signal regarding the institution\u2019s opinion of economic prospects. Therefore, while the FOMC\u2019s interest rate decision in June will be data-dependant, it may also be impacted by the realisation that if interest rates do not rise in June or July, they are very likely to remain at 0.5% until at least December. </p> <p>Cebr believes that raising rates in June or July is premature and unnecessary. The inflationary environment remains benign and the US economy still faces numerous risks on the global front. Lacklustre growth in export markets is already creating problems for the country\u2019s exporters. Further strengthening the US dollar via monetary policy tightening would make US-made products relatively more expensive and therefore less desirable for foreign buyers. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57484008e4b006af16bc10ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-27T12:48:04.142Z\">1.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The question is how this affects the odds on a Fed rate hike this summer?

The Competition and Markets Authority has set a deadline of 13 June for comments on the deal\u2019s likely effects on consumers. It will decide by 25 July whether to launch a preliminary inquiry. Home Retail, which owns Argos, backed the bid from Sainsbury\u2019s in April, ending almost five months of talks between the supermarket group and the general merchandise retailer to create Britain\u2019s biggest seller of general goods. The takeover of Argos is designed to broaden the Sainsbury\u2019s product range and reduce its reliance on the highly competitive grocery market. Sainsbury\u2019s will put Argos stores into its supermarkets, adding to its own range of homeware and other non-food goods. The deal is expected to complete in the third quarter of this year unless the CMA decides to intervene. The CMA said it will decide whether the takeover was classed as a relevant merger, which is likely because Home Retail\u2019s annual revenue is more than the \u00a370m threshold. It will then consider \u201cwhether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services\u201d. If the CMA goes ahead with a preliminary investigation it will have 40 working days to clear the deal, seek remedies or move to a fuller inquiry that could take six months. Sainsbury\u2019s said it had expected the CMA to scrutinise the deal and that it believed the takeover would complete as planned. \u201cWe are pleased that the CMA review process into Sainsbury\u2019s proposed offer to buy Home Retail is progressing. The combination of both businesses will create a multi-product, multi-channel proposition with fast delivery networks, benefiting customers by accelerating our strategy to give them what they want, where and when they want it. We look forward to the successful completion of the deal.\u201d Last month John Walden, Home Retail\u2019s chief executive, said he hoped the deal would not raise major concerns for the CMA but it was too early to tell. The CMA last year withdrew early objections to clear Poundland\u2019s takeover of its single price rival 99p Stores. The deal was subjected to a phase 2 investigation that decided the combined retailer would have competition from other discounters.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A strong warning that austerity policies can do more harm than good has been delivered by economists from the International Monetary Fund, in a critique of the neoliberal doctrine that has dominated economics for the past three decades. In an article seized on by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the IMF economists said rising inequality was bad for growth and that governments should use controls to cope with destabilising capital flows. The IMF team praised some aspects of the liberalising agenda that was ushered in by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, such as the expansion of trade and the increase in foreign direct investment. But it said other aspects of the programme had not delivered the expected improvements in economic performance. Looking specifically at removing barriers to flows of capital and plans to strengthen the public finances, the three IMF economists came up with conclusions that contradicted neoliberal theory. \u201cThe benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries,\u201d they said. \u201cThe costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomise the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda. \u201cIncreased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.\u201d The UK chancellor, George Osborne, announced austerity plans when he took over at the Treasury in May 2010, in an effort to tackle Britain\u2019s record peacetime budget deficit and rising national debt . But his view that paying off the debt accumulated during the deep slump of 2008-09 was vital for the economy\u2019s long-term growth prospects was challenged by the IMF. Osborne said his austerity programme would give the government more flexibility in the event of a future crisis, but the IMF said taking out this sort of insurance policy would only be worth it if the benefits exceeded the costs. \u201cIt turns out, however, that the cost could be large \u2013 much larger than the benefit. The reason is that, to get to a lower debt level, taxes that distort economic behaviour need to be raised temporarily or productive spending needs to be cut \u2013 or both. The costs of the tax increases or expenditure cuts required to bring down the debt may be much larger than the reduced crisis risk engendered by the lower debt.\u201d The economists rejected the notion that austerity could be good for growth by boosting the confidence of the private sector to invest. It said that in practice, \u201cepisodes of fiscal consolidation have been followed, on average, by drops rather than by expansions in output. On average, a consolidation of 1% of GDP increases the long-term unemployment rate by 0.6 percentage points.\u201d McDonnell said: \u201cThe International Monetary Fund has summarised what a growing consensus among economists across the globe now think, that Osborne-style austerity economics increases inequality and instability, and undermines growth. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the chancellor to listen to the experts, change course and put an end to his failed policy of austerity with a solid commitment by government to deliver an industrial strategy backed up by patient investment to create the high-tech, high-wage economy of the future.\u201d The three IMF research department economists \u2013 Jonathan Ostry, Prakash Loungani and Davide Furceri \u2013 said the benefits of some important parts of the neoliberal agenda appeared to have been overplayed, while the risks from short-term flows of hot money in and out of countries loomed large. \u201cIn the case of fiscal consolidation, the short-run costs in terms of lower output and welfare and higher unemployment have been underplayed, and the desirability for countries with ample fiscal space of simply living with high debt and allowing debt ratios to decline organically through growth is underappreciated.\u201d They concluded that the increase in inequality threatened to be self-defeating. \u201cThe increase in inequality engendered by financial openness and austerity might itself undercut growth, the very thing that the neoliberal agenda is intent on boosting. There is now strong evidence that inequality can significantly lower both the level and the durability of growth.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A strong warning that austerity policies can do more harm than good has been delivered by economists from the International Monetary Fund, in a critique of the neoliberal doctrine that has dominated economics for the past three decades. <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm\">In an article</a> seized on by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the IMF economists said rising inequality was bad for growth and that governments should use controls to cope with destabilising capital flows.</p> <p>The IMF team praised some aspects of the liberalising agenda that was ushered in by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, such as the expansion of trade and the increase in foreign direct investment. But it said other aspects of the programme had not delivered the expected improvements in economic performance. Looking specifically at removing barriers to flows of capital and plans to strengthen the public finances, the three IMF economists came up with conclusions that contradicted neoliberal theory.</p> <p>\u201cThe benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries,\u201d they said. \u201cThe costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomise the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.\u00ad<br></p> <p>\u201cIncreased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.\u00ad\u201d</p> <p>The UK chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/budget-2010-vat-austerity-plan\">George Osborne, announced austerity plans </a>when he took over at the Treasury in May 2010, in an effort to tackle Britain\u2019s record peacetime budget deficit and rising national debt . But his view that paying off the debt accumulated during the deep slump of 2008-09 was vital for the economy\u2019s long-term growth prospects was challenged by the IMF.</p> <p>Osborne said his austerity programme would give the government more flexibility in the event of a future crisis, but the IMF said taking out this sort of insurance policy would only be worth it if the benefits exceeded the costs.</p> <p>\u201cIt turns out, however, that the cost could be large \u2013 much larger than the benefit. The reason is that, to get to a lower debt level, taxes that distort economic behaviour need to be raised temporarily or productive spending needs to be cut \u2013 or both. The costs of the tax increases or expenditure cuts required to bring down the debt may be much larger than the reduced crisis risk engendered by the lower debt.\u201d</p> <p>The economists rejected the notion that austerity could be good for growth by boosting the confidence of the private sector to invest. It said that in practice, \u201cepisodes of fiscal consolidation have been followed, on average, by drops rather than by expansions in output. On average, a consolidation of 1% of GDP increases the long-term unemployment rate by 0.6 percentage points.\u201d </p> <p>McDonnell said: \u201cThe International Monetary Fund has summarised what a growing consensus among economists across the globe now think, that Osborne-style austerity economics increases inequality and instability, and undermines growth.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for the chancellor to listen to the experts, change course and put an end to his failed policy of austerity with a solid commitment by government to deliver an industrial strategy backed up by patient investment to create the high-tech, high-wage economy of the future.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The three IMF research department economists \u2013 Jonathan Ostry, Prakash Loungani and Davide Furceri \u2013 said the benefits of some important parts of the neoliberal agenda appeared to have been overplayed, while the risks from short-term flows of hot money in and out of countries loomed large.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case of fiscal consolidation, the short-run costs in terms of lower output and welfare and higher unemployment have been underplayed, and the desirability for countries with ample fiscal space of simply living with high debt and allowing debt ratios to decline organically through growth is underappreciated.\u201d<br></p> <p>They concluded that the increase in inequality threatened to be self-defeating. \u201cThe increase in inequality engendered by financial openness and austerity might itself undercut growth, the very thing that the neoliberal agenda is intent on boosting. There is now strong evidence that inequality can significantly lower both the level and the durability of growth.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A \u00a35m \u201cbonanza\u201d cited by Dominic Chappell to bolster his business credentials when buying BHS last year was an accounting estimate and not the cash payment he had previously claimed. Chappell had presented the windfall in the accounts of Olivia Investments, his family\u2019s holding company in Gibraltar, to counter concerns that the former bankrupt had little relevant experience when acquiring the retailer in 2015. However, a Guardian analysis of Olivia Investments\u2019 publicly filed accounts shows the figure is derived from the company increasing its judgment on the value of its assets by 150 times. There is no explanation about how the company arrived at this uplift over a 12-month period, while the documents show the business\u2019s bank balance remained unchanged at \u00a32,000. The discovery that Chappell appears not to have received the \u00a35m payment he previously claimed will raise further questions about the quality of the due diligence conducted on the businessman before his consortium Retail Acquisitions acquired BHS for \u00a31 from Sir Philip Green. The department store chain collapsed into administration barely a year after Chappell acquired it, leaving 11,000 jobs at risk and the company pension fund in deficit to the tune of \u00a3571m. Since acquiring BHS, more than \u00a325m was paid out from BHS to Retail Acquisitions, in the period between its sale and it falling into administration. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. When Chappell acquired BHS, the Sunday Times quoted the businessman as saying he had made a \u00a35m \u201cbonanza\u201d from an oil storage facility in Cadiz, Spain, which he ploughed into the retailer. He also told the Guardian earlier this month: \u201c[The \u00a35m is in] the audited accounts of Olivia Investments. Go and look at the accounts you will see a \u00a35m payment ... If you do your work you will see that Olivia Investments had five point something [million pound] payment to it ... We made the money, those funds are down there and are in our audited accounts. If you don\u2019t believe me I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d However, while the Olivia Investments accounts do show an increase in the value of the company\u2019s assets, the rise had nothing to do with any payment being received. The spurt came after the company revalued its tangible fixed assets \u2013 which are typically items such as buildings, land and machines \u2013 from \u00a333,716 in 2012 to \u00a35.1m during 2013, a rise of around 150 times during the year. Richard Kleiner, chief executive of chartered accountants Gerald Edelman, said: \u201cThe accounts of Olivia Investments are very light on detail and certainly contain no information in order to give credibility as to the revaluation of the fixed asset investments. The increase in the net asset value would appear to be wholly down to the revaluation and not to any cash receipts.\u201d Chappell did not comment. The Guardian revealed at the beginning of May that Chappell was forced out of a previous oil storage facility venture in Cadiz after taking about \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3315,000) from the company for his personal use. The money, which appears to have been moved without the permission of other shareholders and has never been repaid, was transferred from a startup in Spain called Olivia Petroleum. The money is understood to have been diverted into other accounts, including one belonging to Chappell\u2019s wife. Chappell had also previously used Olivia Petroleum as a way of assuaging doubts about his business credentials.",

      "bodyText": "A million more young people could have to live with their parents over the next decade to save enough for a deposit to buy their own home. The insurance company Aviva has estimated that 3.8 million people aged between 21 and 34 could be living in the family home by 2025, up from 2.8 million in 2015. Rising house prices were making it increasingly difficult for young people to get on to the property ladder, Aviva said, after average UK house prices had risen more than 50% to \u00a3279,000 between 2005 and 2015. As well as having to provide a home for longer for their children, parents are also helping fund deposits. The \u201cbank of mum and dad\u201d will help finance a quarter of all UK mortgage deals in 2016, with an average contribution of \u00a317,500, according to a Legal &amp; General report earlier this month. Parents will stump up a total of \u00a35bn to help their offspring buy a house this year, L&amp;G estimated. In the 10 years to 2015, the number of young people living with their parents increased by almost 700,000, or 32%, transforming the makeup of UK households by making multigenerational living much more common. Lindsey Rix from Aviva, said: \u201cMultigenerational living is often seen as a necessity rather than a choice, particularly when adults are forced to move back in with family to help save for long-term goals like buying their own house. \u201cBut rather than being an inconvenience, our report shows it is often a positive experience, with shared living costs reducing financial strain and the added benefit of constant company.\u201d When young people were asked by Aviva about what might prompt them to remain with their parents or move back in for six months or more, saving for a house deposit was the second most common reason given, at 57%. The most common answer was caring for an unwell relative, at 71%. About 42% of adults said living in a multigenerational household would be a positive arrangement, rising to 66% among those already living this way. Respondents to the Aviva survey said having other people around for company, shared living costs and more people with whom to share chores were among the benefits. About 12% of people living in a multigenerational household said the disadvantages outweighed the benefits, compared with 21% of all UK adults. Rising rents have put pressure on young people who want to buy a home, accounting for more of their pay and making it harder to save a deposit. Although 95% mortgages have made a comeback, in parts of the country where prices are high, buyers need large deposits so they can pass lenders\u2019 affordability checks for mortgages. Figures published on Friday by the Office for National Statistics showed that rents across Great Britain rose by an average of 2.6% in the 12 months to April, with tenants in London seeing the biggest jump in prices. The ONS\u2019s private rental index showed tenants were paying more in all parts of the country, with rents up 2.8% in England, 0.2% in Wales and 0.5% in Scotland. In London, rents were up 3.7% over the year. The thinktank the Resolution Foundation said the ONS\u2019s figures showed the cost of renting in London had increased by a fifth over the last five years while pay had flatlined. Lindsay Judge, senior research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThis is bad news for living standards, bad news for employers and bad news for the wider economy. \u201cGetting to grips with the affordability crunch facing private renters in London is a tough task that the new mayor will need to take on.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Millennials aren't buying homes right now. What if they never do?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Somebody is buying houses in the United States \u2013 but it sure isn\u2019t millennials. Just ask their parents. They\u2019ll be the ones worrying in the kitchen about whether their little darlings will ever leave. Purchases of single-family homes posted a whopping 16.6% jump during April over March\u2019s levels, the largest such one-month gain recorded in more than eight years, and the median price point hit a record $321,100. Prices and sales should be rising. Mortgage rates remain close to record lows, the private sector created 160,000 new jobs in April \u2013 and the national unemployment rate is now only 5%. Even taking into account all the debate over the ways in which that unemployment figure understates the actual rate (and fails to capture underemployment by swaths of the population), that\u2019s not to be sneezed at. Still, there\u2019s one demographic group that, notably, isn\u2019t touring open houses or scouring online listings in search of their new homes. No prizes for guessing which one. Yes, far from buying new homes, millennials increasingly aren\u2019t even renting. The proportion of this demographic \u2013 aged around 18 to 35 \u2013 who end up living with their parents has been on the rise steadily since the Great Recession, peaking at about 36%, according to the Pew Research Center. Now, for the first time in 130 years, living with your parents has become the most common living arrangement for young men and women aged 18 to 34, Pew reported this week. No wonder voters are turning, in their millions, to \u201cprotest candidates\u201d such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, who promise (in very, very different ways) to upend the economic system as it exists today. Historically, for the past century or so, American society has tended to favor nuclear family households: mom, dad, kids, dog or cat, etc. You\u2019d head to grandma and grandpa\u2019s for Thanksgiving and other holidays, but you didn\u2019t live there. Even if you lived on a farm and worked it with your family members, you might occupy a separate house, built when you married and established your own household. Adding a very elderly, widowed grandparent to the household when they could no longer live alone was so rare as to arouse astonished comment. Sure, it happened, but rarely. The Great Recession has torn up the rule book. Parents lost their jobs, and sometimes their homes, and often saw their retirement savings dwindle or evaporate. Their millennial children may have been able to afford to attend college but probably graduated with a load of debt. Where will they get the money for a down payment for a house? Their cash-strapped parents probably can\u2019t help. But where will they find the money for the monthly mortgage payments when they have outsize monthly student loan repayments to make? Even if they didn\u2019t have student loans to deal with, the affordability problem remains. In those markets where prices have soared, making buying a home problematic even for millennials\u2019 older and more solvent peers, buying even a closet is simply out of the question. Apartment List, an online rental marketplace, ran some numbers and calculated that it would take an average of a decade for millennials to come up with the required 20% down payment to buy a home in the dozen or so most in-demand urban locales. San Francisco distorts those results, of course: based on average starter home prices and average millennial savings rates, they\u2019d have to save for 28 years before being able to buy their first home. (By that time, of course, they\u2019d probably be worrying about financing their children\u2019s college tuition and just wouldn\u2019t bother.) While millennials routinely answer polls as to why they aren\u2019t buying homes (or making other big consumption decisions) by saying that they are waiting until they get married, or until they can afford it (whenever that might be), what is just as striking in the Pew Research study\u2019s results is the explosion in the category referred to as \u201cother living arrangements\u201d to a level also not recorded since 1880. This is a category that Pew defines as sharing space with a grandparent, a sibling, a roommate or housemate, or living in some kind of other shared space, like a college dormitory. Instead of venturing off to live independently, or pairing up (married or just cohabiting), more than half of all millennials now opt for some kind of \u201cuntraditional\u201d living relationship once they reach adulthood, sharing their living space with a non-partner. It\u2019s no surprise that the cities with the biggest affordability problem have been those to see the biggest boom in \u201cadult dorms\u201d, or \u201cco-living\u201d projects, in which residents have their own small rooms (sometimes shared) and then large, common spaces, such as kitchens and living rooms. Think of a cooler, millennial version of Friends. One way or another, this is a challenge to the status quo. Politically, it serves as a constant reminder that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d simply isn\u2019t good enough any longer. Free tuition? (Forget for a moment the risk of unintended negative consequences, ranging from subsidizing wealthy students\u2019 tuition to the fact that there will be no incentive for students to graduate on time; university students in tuition-free Germany take, on average, until they are 26 to complete an undergraduate program.) Well, why not? That\u2019s just the most obvious of the populist proposals put forth by this year\u2019s presidential candidates who argue that the system itself is so flawed as to be in need of scrapping \u2013 Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. It\u2019s also a challenge to corporate interests. For every business that figures out a way to cater to this new way of living \u2013 millennials won\u2019t own cars, so Uber and Zipcar will thrive; millennials won\u2019t buy homes, so co-living projects such as those developed by WeWork might be the model of the future, not suburban developments of semi-detached houses \u2013 scores won\u2019t. What, for instance, will happen to Home Depot if every millennial couple doesn\u2019t have their own kitchen to remodel because they\u2019re still sharing one with a bigger family unit or a group of their peers? What if, after yearning for one in their early 20s, they realize that they have existed just fine with their bikes and the occasional Zipcar rental and decide not to add to the air pollution haze? And what if \u2013 gasp \u2013 they decide they actually like their current living arrangements and choose to find a way to remain in them, even when their economic position becomes less strained? This is, after all, the generation turning out in droves to support Sanders, and refusing to accept the political status quo. Why accept the economic status quo? Before you say, pshaw, it will never happen, stop and think. It already has, about four decades ago, when baby boomers \u2013 the last generation of this size \u2013 took both the political and the economic status quo, turned it on its head and shook it. The catalyst for what is happening today is quite different \u2013 an economic crisis rather than a war \u2013 but it\u2019s far from impossible that the combination of political and economic stressors could end up creating radically new rules of the road.",

The proportion of this demographic \u2013 aged around 18 to 35 \u2013 who end up living with their parents has been on the rise steadily since the Great Recession, peaking at about 36%, according to the Pew Research Center.</p> <p> Now, <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/05/24/for-first-time-in-modern-era-living-with-parents-edges-out-other-living-arrangements-for-18-to-34-year-olds/\">for the first time in 130 years</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/millennials-living-with-parents-callout\">living with your parents has become the most common living arrangement</a> for young men and women aged 18 to 34, Pew reported this week. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/millennials-living-with-parents-callout\">Parents housing adult children: tell us about your nest that refuses to empty</a> </p> </aside>  <p> No wonder voters are turning, in their millions, to \u201cprotest candidates\u201d such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, who promise (in very, very different ways) to upend the economic system as it exists today. </p> <p>Historically, for the past century or so, American society has tended to favor nuclear family households: mom, dad, kids, dog or cat, etc. You\u2019d head to grandma and grandpa\u2019s for Thanksgiving and other holidays, but you didn\u2019t live there. Even if you lived on a farm and worked it with your family members, you might occupy a separate house, built when you married and established your own household. Adding a very elderly, widowed grandparent to the household when they could no longer live alone was so rare as to arouse astonished comment. Sure, it happened, but rarely. </p> <p>The Great Recession has torn up the rule book.</p> <p>Parents lost their jobs, and sometimes their homes, and often saw their retirement savings dwindle or evaporate. Their millennial children may have been able to afford to attend college but probably graduated with a load of debt. </p> <p>Where will they get the money for a down payment for a house? Their cash-strapped parents probably can\u2019t help. But where will they find the money for the monthly mortgage payments when they have outsize monthly student loan repayments to make? </p> <p>Even if they didn\u2019t have student loans to deal with, the affordability problem remains. In those markets where prices have soared, making buying a home problematic even for millennials\u2019 older and more solvent peers, buying even a closet is simply out of the question. Apartment List, an online rental marketplace, ran some numbers and calculated that it would take an average of a decade for millennials to come up with the required 20% down payment to buy a home in the dozen or so most in-demand urban locales. </p> <p>San Francisco distorts those results, of course: based on average starter home prices and average millennial savings rates, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/20/rent-millennials-home-downpayment/\">they\u2019d have to save for 28 years</a> before being able to buy their first home. (By that time, of course, they\u2019d probably be worrying about financing their children\u2019s college tuition and just wouldn\u2019t bother.) </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e5cb7a320b97d68c7e32238b99d1059822096b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e5cb7a320b97d68c7e32238b99d1059822096b9/0_0_5200_3466/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What, for instance, will happen to Home Depot if every millennial couple doesn\u2019t have their own kitchen to remodel because they\u2019re still sharing one with a bigger family unit or a group of their peers?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What, for instance, will happen to Home Depot if every millennial couple doesn\u2019t have their own kitchen to remodel because they\u2019re still sharing one with a bigger family unit or a group of their peers?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While millennials routinely answer polls as to why they aren\u2019t buying homes (or making other big consumption decisions) by saying that they are waiting until they get married, or until they can afford it (whenever that might be), what is just as striking in the Pew Research study\u2019s results is the explosion in the category referred to as \u201cother living arrangements\u201d to a level also not recorded since 1880.</p> <p>This is a category that Pew defines as sharing space with a grandparent, a sibling, a roommate or housemate, or living in some kind of other shared space, like a college dormitory. Instead of venturing off to live independently, or pairing up (married or just cohabiting), <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/05/24/1-the-evolving-landscape-of-young-adult-living-arrangements/\">more than half of all millennials</a> now opt for some kind of \u201cuntraditional\u201d living relationship once they reach adulthood, sharing their living space with a non-partner. </p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise that the cities with the biggest affordability problem have been those to see the biggest boom in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/20/co-living-companies-reinventing-roommates-open-door-common-\">\u201cadult dorms\u201d, or \u201cco-living\u201d projects</a>, in which residents have their own small rooms (sometimes shared) and then large, common spaces, such as kitchens and living rooms. Think of a cooler, millennial version of Friends. </p> <p>One way or another, this is a challenge to the status quo. Politically, it serves as a constant reminder that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d simply isn\u2019t good enough any longer. Free tuition? (Forget for a moment the risk of unintended negative consequences, ranging from subsidizing wealthy students\u2019 tuition to the fact that there will be no incentive for students to graduate on time; university students in tuition-free Germany take, on average, <a href=\"http://nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Resources/Int__lHigherEd_AppendixA.pdf\">until they are 26</a> to complete an undergraduate program.) Well, why not? That\u2019s just the most obvious of the populist proposals put forth by this year\u2019s presidential candidates who argue that the system itself is so flawed as to be in need of scrapping \u2013 Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a challenge to corporate interests. For every business that figures out a way to cater to this new way of living \u2013 millennials won\u2019t own cars, so Uber and Zipcar will thrive; millennials won\u2019t buy homes, so co-living projects such as those developed by WeWork might be the model of the future, not suburban developments of semi-detached houses \u2013 scores won\u2019t. </p> <p>What, for instance, will happen to Home Depot if every millennial couple doesn\u2019t have their own kitchen to remodel because they\u2019re still sharing one with a bigger family unit or a group of their peers? What if, after yearning for one in their early 20s, they realize that they have existed just fine with their bikes and the occasional Zipcar rental and decide not to add to the air pollution haze? </p> <p>And what if \u2013 gasp \u2013 they decide they actually like their current living arrangements and choose to find a way to remain in them, even when their economic position becomes less strained? This is, after all, the generation turning out in droves to support Sanders, and refusing to accept the political status quo. Why <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/the-cheapest-generation/309060/\">accept the economic status quo</a>?</p> <p>Before you say, pshaw, it will never happen, stop and think. It already has, about four decades ago, when baby boomers \u2013 the last generation of this size \u2013 took both the political and the economic status quo, turned it on its head and shook it. The catalyst for what is happening today is quite different \u2013 an economic crisis rather than a war \u2013 but it\u2019s far from impossible that the combination of political and economic stressors could end up creating radically new rules of the road. </p>",

The deal will transfer \u00a312.3bn of assets under management and more than 910,000 policies to Phoenix. The sale includes the pension and investment businesses Embassy and SunLife, which offer life cover to the over-50s. The Bristol-based SunLife has been part of the French insurance giant since 1996. Clive Bannister, chief executive of Phoenix, said the acquisition of the Embassy and SunLife businesses was another important step forward in the firm\u2019s growth strategy. Phoenix specialises in buying life assurance businesses that are closed to new customers. Bannister said: \u201cWe will invest heavily to ensure a smooth transition of the two businesses from Axa to Phoenix and we are committed to delivering the highest level of service to both direct and IFA [independent financial adviser] customers, as we do for our existing customers.

On top of that, investors are cautious ahead of the long weekend after G7 leaders added to the chorus suggesting that the UK leaving the European Union would be a threat to global growth. So the FTSE 100 is virtually unchanged, up just 0.25 points at 6265.90. Outsourcing group Capita is among the fallers, down 1.6% at \u00a310.80 after analysts at Exane BNP Paribas cut their rating from neutral to underpeform, with a target price of \u00a310.50. They said earnings quality remained weak and liabilities had continued to rise. Mining shares have moved higher, helped by dollar weakness and the suggestion that Japan may delay a sales tax, a move which would help consumer confidence and economic growth in the region. Rio Tinto has risen 23.5p to 1992.5p while Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo is up 10p at \u00a310.42 as gold and silver prices moved higher. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: It\u2019s a broadly flat start to trade in London once again as the FTSE-100 attempts to cling onto the gains we saw posted at the start of the week. Brent Crude may have failed to regain its hold on the $50 a barrel mark, but commodity stocks are still finding favour, helped in no small part by US dollar weakness amidst the idea that the Fed may not be in a position to hike rates next month as had been earlier thought. Utilities were also in demand, with United Utilities up 12p at 967p as recovered from the fall which immediately followed Thursday\u2019s results. Severn Trent has added 14p to \u00a322.96 while National Grid has climbed 7p to \u00a310.07. Banks have mostly edged higher, despite Thursday\u2019s surprise rights issue from Spain\u2019s Banco Popular. Barclays is 0.7p better at 185.5p and HSBC is 0.55p higher at 446.5p.

They said earnings quality remained weak and liabilities had continued to rise.</p> <p>Mining shares have moved higher, helped by dollar weakness and the suggestion that Japan may delay a sales tax, a move which would help consumer confidence and economic growth in the region.</p> <p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> has risen 23.5p to 1992.5p while Mexican precious metals miner <strong>Fresnillo </strong>is up 10p at \u00a310.42 as gold and silver prices moved higher. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a broadly flat start to trade in London once again as the FTSE-100 attempts to cling onto the gains we saw posted at the start of the week. Brent Crude may have failed to regain its hold on the $50 a barrel mark, but commodity stocks are still finding favour, helped in no small part by US dollar weakness amidst the idea that the Fed may not be in a position to hike rates next month as had been earlier thought.</p> </blockquote> <p>Utilities were also in demand, with <strong>United Utilities</strong> up 12p at 967p as recovered from the fall which immediately followed Thursday\u2019s results. <strong>Severn Trent</strong> has added 14p to \u00a322.96 while <strong>National Grid</strong> has climbed 7p to \u00a310.07.</p> <p>Banks have mostly edged higher, despite Thursday\u2019s surprise rights issue from Spain\u2019s Banco Popular. <strong>Barclays</strong> is 0.7p better at 185.5p and<strong> HSBC </strong>is 0.55p higher at 446.5p. But <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> has dropped 7.2p to 542p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cloud storage providers are treating customers unfairly and risk users losing access to their photos and other personal possessions, the competition regulator said. An investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority found providers offered contract terms and practices that could breach consumer law. About three in 10 adults in the UK use cloud services to store personal items such as photos, music, films and other documents on a remote server. Most services are free with smartphones and tablets. Providers include Apple iCloud, Google Drive, and Dropbox. The CMA said that while cloud storage was a valuable service it was unhappy with some areas, including the ability of providers to change contract terms at any time, for any reason, and without giving notice. Nisha Arora, the senior director of consumer at the CMA, said: \u201cCloud storage offers a convenient means of keeping family photos, favourite music and films and important documents safe, and accessing them quickly from any device. \u201cOur review found that people find these services really valuable. However, we also heard some complaints resulting from unfair terms in contracts. If left unchanged, these terms could result in people losing access to their treasured possessions or facing unexpected charges.\u201d The CMA said it was concerned by contract terms that let providers suspend or terminate a contract without reason or notice. It added that providers could also be breaching consumer law by automatically renewing a contract at the end of a fixed term without giving notice or the right to withdraw. Following the inquiry, Dixons Carphone, JustCloud and Livedrive committed to providing fairer terms to cloud customers, and the CMA urged others to do the same. Arora said: \u201cIn this rapidly developing market, it\u2019s important that we act now to ensure that businesses comply with the law and that consumers\u2019 trust in these valuable services is maintained. \u201cWe welcome the fact that a number of companies have already agreed to change their terms, and expect to see improvements from other companies.\u201d The CMA advised consumers to get the necessary information before they sign up to a service, and to challenge providers where they think terms are unfair.",
