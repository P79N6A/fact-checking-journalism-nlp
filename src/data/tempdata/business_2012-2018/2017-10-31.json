      "bodyText": "Banks could start to make irreversible moves to transfer staff from London to rival cities in the EU unless there is clarity over Brexit by the end of the year, the Financial Conduct Authority chief executive has told MPs. Andrew Bailey, in a wide-ranging appearance before MPs on the Treasury select committee, said contingency plans being implemented by major banks involved leasing office space, which could be reversed in the event there was not a hard Brexit, or a transition deal was agreed. \u201cThey regard those as fairly reversible,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cWhere it starts to get more irreversible \u2013 or harder \u2013 is in terms of staff.\u201d He said there was a need for a \u201cstrong commitment\u201d to a transition period by the end of the year \u2013 echoing the views of Bank of England officials and City lobby groups. From 1 April 2019, City firms would need to keep operating inside the EU and would need to plan in advance and either recruit locally or convince staff to leave London, said Bailey. \u201cSo that is why they \u2013 and we \u2013 tend to take the view that the end of this year, beginning of next year, is the point at which these sorts of things start happening,\u201d he added. Goldman Sachs has begun to implement contingency plans by taking the top eight floors of a 37-storey block under construction in Frankfurt, even though it is building a new European headquarters in London. On Monday Lloyd Blankfein, the boss of Goldman, tweeted an aerial shot of the new \u00a3350m building under construction in London, with the words \u201cexpecting/hoping to fill it up, but so much outside our control\u201d. The BBC reported that the Bank of England believed up to 75,000 UK financial services roles could be at risk. The committee of MPs started its evidence session with Bailey in often hostile questioning over the regulator\u2019s handling of a report into Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s treatment of small business customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). Bailey has refused to publish the so-called section 166 report commissioned from the consultancy Promontory to look at allegations RBS deliberately wrecked small businesses to make profits. He told MPs that RBS had not accepted some of the findings of the report, which had added to delays to the report which was commissioned three years ago. \u201cThe report is strongly critical of RBS. It is frankly unfortunate that RBS has not accepted that more readily. I think they should do,\u201d said Bailey. The committee published a letter from RBS chief executive Ross McEwan in which he said the bank \u201cdeeply regret the mistakes we have made in the past\u201d but disputed parts of the report. Last week the FCA said it was considering whether it could take action against the bank and Bailey told the MPs it \u201ccould lead to enforcement action\u201d \u2013 which could mean sanctions such as fines. Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP and chair of the committee, said she would call RBS to give evidence. \u201cOne of the FCA\u2019s objectives is to promote and enhance integrity of the UK financial system ... Widespread bad practice by a bank like RBS surely goes to the heart of attacking the integrity of the UK financial system,\u201d said Morgan. Consumers\u2019 mental health and family lives had suffered, she added.",

    "webTitle": "UK mining firm in court over claims it mistreated environmental activists", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A UK-registered mining company, which is now part of Glencore, is facing claims in a London court that it hired security forces to mistreat environmental activists protesting about a copper mine in Peru. Two demonstrators died and others were left with serious injuries following the confrontations which lasted for several days during May 2012 on a remote hillside in the Andes, the court has been told. The two-week trial of the mining company, Xstrata, being held at the Rolls Building in central London, where commercial cases are heard, will be determined under Peruvian law. It is taking evidence from leading legal experts. Two of the protesters, Sergio Huamani and Alberto Huallpa, went to London to attend the hearing, which is being translated into Spanish and English. Lawyers for Xstrata argue that the claims have been brought too late and should be barred under a statute of limitations which imposes a two-year time limit. But Phillippa Kaufmann QC, for the claimants, maintained the cases were not out of time. The copper mine in Peru was at the time owned by Xstrata Tintaya, a firm later renamed Compan\u00eda Minera Antapaccay. Xstrata was alleged to have paid the equivalent of \u00a3700,000 for the services of about 1,300 Peruvian national police and provided them with weapons such as rubber bullets and teargas, as well as food and accommodation. It is alleged that the company encouraged the security forces to mistreat the eco-protesters, who had gathered near the Tintaya copper mine near the town of Espinar. Demonstrators were shot and beaten by officers, it was claimed. The company denies liability, arguing that police protection was necessary since thousands of protesters, many carrying traditional slingshots, were marching towards the mine. Xstrata also said that the Peruvian national police operated independently and it had no control over their behaviour. At an earlier hearing, in July 2016, emails from Charles Sartain, an Xstrata director, to the senior South America manager, Jose Marun, were disclosed. These proposed that a \u201cdirect, proactive and strong approach\u201d be taken to confront community representatives who were referred to as \u201csons of whores\u201d. The court has also been told that in the run-up to the protests in 2012 the mining company \u201ccovertly monitored\u201d community meetings and employed informants, sharing its intelligence with the police. During the fighting, it is said, private security officers employed by the mine wielded metal bars and planks of wood. Some protesters allegedly were shot, others beaten on the head or on the soles of their feet. In one clash, the court was told, police fired machine guns and shotguns. The 22 Peruvians who have brought the claim are represented by Leigh Day, the London law firm which specialises in class action disputes. Before the hearing, Sergio Huamani, 42, a farmer, said: \u201cI was attacked severely by the police and beaten on my head and nose because I was protesting about the environmental impact of the copper mine. I hope we will find justice here. The mine is still producing copper and has expanded. It is working without social or environmental responsibility.\u201d Alberto Huallpa, 29, an accountant, said he had been shot in the left thigh by a bullet. \u201cWe are opposed to contamination caused by the mine,\u201d he said. The pollution was \u201cgetting into water courses and streams\u201d. The damage, he alleged, was caused by heavy metals including cadmium and arsenic. \u201cWe turned up for the protest because the company was not listening to us. I am glad to bring my complaint here so that our pain and suffering comes to the court.\u201d Xstrata was taken over by the minerals and trading conglomerate Glencore in 2013. It denies that the mine is causing pollution and insists that it complies with environmental laws. The hearing continues.",

    "webTitle": "Burberry's careful designs are undone as Christopher Bailey bows out | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry\u2019s well-paid bosses never quit their jobs, they \u201ctransition\u201d out of them. Under the long chairmanship of Sir John Peace, the word has been obligatory at the fashion house and is designed to encourage the impression of smooth corporate progress towards greater conquests. The exit of design guru Christopher Bailey, alongside glowing (and deserved) personal tributes, was given the usual treatment. Burberry is embarking on the next \u201cchapter\u201d in its \u201cjourney\u201d and is ready for \u201cthe next exciting stage of our evolution\u201d blah blah. Maybe it is, but shareholders could fairly expect Peace to explain why his carefully laid plan to retain Bailey\u2019s services has come apart at the seams after only a few months. It was as recently as July that Bailey, after a tricky three years as chief executive, was installed as Burberry\u2019s president and chief creative officer. The man himself seemed pleased with his return to pure design work. He would have \u201ca wonderfully collaborative partnership\u201d with new chief executive Marco Gobbetti and his own \u201cpassion for making Burberry the most compelling brand\u201d had \u201cnever been stronger\u201d he said. Now the passion has cooled for reasons that have not been adequately explained. Bailey wants to pursue unspecified \u201cnew creative projects,\u201d a decision that will cost him \u00a316m in lost incentive payments. He\u2019s been spectacularly rewarded over the years but that\u2019s still a princely sum to surrender. The suspicion will be that the double act with Gobbetti proved unworkable in practice, just as sceptical outsiders suggested it would. Bailey is staying on the board until March, so there is time to hire or promote new design chiefs \u2013 but this cannot be the script Peace anticipated. For years the chairman presented Bailey as Mr Indispensable, even going to war with shareholders in 2014 to defend a \u00a315m long-term pay package that he argued was essential to deter approaches from rivals. Now Bailey is off and Gobbetti is the new star. That\u2019s a transition of sorts but it\u2019s not the one Burberry thought it was getting for all those retention millions. It may be a jolt. Government has played a poor hand on problem gambling Place your bets. The current maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals is \u00a3100. Will the government cut to \u00a350, \u00a330, \u00a320 or \u00a32? This column\u2019s money is on \u00a320. The long-awaited review described the \u00a350 option as representing \u201cminimal change to the status quo\u201d which probably means it was included only to give the impression of open-mindedness. At the other extreme, the \u00a32 idea feels too bold since the Treasury still likes the tax revenues from the machines. That leaves the two middle options. The practical difference between \u00a320 and \u00a330 is slight but the lower level looks more likely to be adopted because it offers more scope for the government to boast about being tough. Ministers are always in the business of managing expectations. What would the right choice? That\u2019s easier \u2013 \u00a32. Politicians have danced around this debate for years, but there has always been two simple points to grasp. First, the \u201ccrack cocaine of gambling\u201d label is basically a correct description of fixed-odds betting terminals. The core product is roulette, a casino game where the house\u2019s edge is set in stone. It is true that only a minority of players will try to chase their losses but, with only 20 seconds between spins (a big difference from how the game is played in casinos), the danger for addicts is plainly intensified. A \u00a320 limit on stakes would be more palatable if spin frequencies were extended to a minute. The second point is that the big chains, for all their protests about good intentions, have done a poor job of policing problem gambling. There have been too many cases of high-profile failures. That much was predictable, which is why New Labour was disgracefully naive in allowing the fixed-odds revolution in the first place. \u201cIn 2005 we didn\u2019t know how these machines would explode on to every high street, converting our betting shops into what [are] essentially high street digital casinos,\u201d pleaded Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, on Tuesday. Come on, that outcome wasn\u2019t hard to guess: if you offer bookies semi-guaranteed cash flows, they will seize the opportunity. Energy firms\u2019 hefty margins help fuel intervention What\u2019s a fair profit margin for an energy supplier to make? Centrica, which owns British Gas, has always argued that 5% is about right, so presumably it would see no problem in regulator Ofgem\u2019s finding that the average in sector was 4.5% last year. To outside eyes, however, an average of 4.5% (and 7.2% for British Gas itself) will look rich. The big supermarkets rub along on about 2%-3% these days and Tesco\u2019s previous attempt to sustain 5% was self-defeating since it allowed Aldi and Lidl into the market. Comparisons between different industries with different investment profiles are problematic, of course.

      "body": "<p>Burberry\u2019s well-paid bosses never quit their jobs, they \u201ctransition\u201d out of them. Under the long chairmanship of Sir John Peace, the word has been obligatory at the fashion house and is designed to encourage the impression of smooth corporate progress towards greater conquests.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/31/christopher-bailey-to-cut-all-ties-with-burberry\">exit of design guru Christopher Bailey</a>, alongside glowing (and deserved) personal tributes, was given the usual treatment. Burberry is embarking on the next \u201cchapter\u201d in its \u201cjourney\u201d and is ready for \u201cthe next exciting stage of our evolution\u201d blah blah. Maybe it is, but shareholders could fairly expect Peace to explain why his carefully laid plan to retain Bailey\u2019s services has come apart at the seams after only a few months.</p> <p>It was as recently as July that Bailey, after a tricky three years as chief executive, was installed as Burberry\u2019s president and chief creative officer. The man himself seemed pleased with his return to pure design work. He would have \u201ca wonderfully collaborative partnership\u201d with new chief executive Marco Gobbetti and his own \u201cpassion for making Burberry the most compelling brand\u201d had \u201cnever been stronger\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/31/christopher-bailey-burberry-transformed-fashion-brand\">Christopher Bailey: how Burberry's creative force transformed the brand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now the passion has cooled for reasons that have not been adequately explained. Bailey wants to pursue unspecified \u201cnew creative projects,\u201d a decision that will cost him \u00a316m in lost incentive payments. He\u2019s been spectacularly rewarded over the years but that\u2019s still a princely sum to surrender. The suspicion will be that the double act with Gobbetti proved unworkable in practice, just as sceptical outsiders suggested it would.</p> <p>Bailey is staying on the board until March, so there is time to hire or promote new design chiefs \u2013 but this cannot be the script Peace anticipated. For years the chairman presented Bailey as Mr Indispensable, even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/11/burberry-shareholders-revolt-christian-bailey-pay-package\">going to war with shareholders in 2014</a> to defend a \u00a315m long-term pay package that he argued was essential to deter approaches from rivals.</p> <p>Now Bailey is off and Gobbetti is the new star. That\u2019s a transition of sorts but it\u2019s not the one Burberry thought it was getting for all those retention millions. It may be a jolt.</p> <h2>Government has played a poor hand on problem gambling</h2> <p>Place your bets. The current maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals is \u00a3100. Will the government cut to \u00a350, \u00a330, \u00a320 or \u00a32? This column\u2019s money is on \u00a320.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/31/uk-government-cracks-down-fixed-odds-betting-terminals-fobt\">long-awaited review</a> described the \u00a350 option as representing \u201cminimal change to the status quo\u201d which probably means it was included only to give the impression of open-mindedness. At the other extreme, the \u00a32 idea feels too bold since the Treasury still likes the tax revenues from the machines.</p> <p>That leaves the two middle options. The practical difference between \u00a320 and \u00a330 is slight but the lower level looks more likely to be adopted because it offers more scope for the government to boast about being tough. Ministers are always in the business of managing expectations.</p> <p>What would the right choice? That\u2019s easier \u2013 \u00a32. Politicians have danced around this debate for years, but there has always been two simple points to grasp.</p> <p>First, the \u201ccrack cocaine of gambling\u201d label is basically a correct description of fixed-odds betting terminals. The core product is roulette, a casino game where the house\u2019s edge is set in stone. It is true that only a minority of players will try to chase their losses but, with only 20 seconds between spins (a big difference from how the game is played in casinos), the danger for addicts is plainly intensified. A \u00a320 limit on stakes would be more palatable if spin frequencies were extended to a minute.</p> <p>The second point is that the big chains, for all their protests about good intentions, have done a poor job of policing problem gambling. There have been too many cases of high-profile failures. That much was predictable, which is why New Labour was disgracefully naive in allowing the fixed-odds revolution in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2005 we didn\u2019t know how these machines would explode on to every high street, converting our betting shops into what [are] essentially high street digital casinos,\u201d pleaded Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, on Tuesday. Come on, that outcome wasn\u2019t hard to guess: if you offer bookies semi-guaranteed cash flows, they will seize the opportunity.</p> <h2>Energy firms\u2019 hefty margins help fuel intervention</h2> <p>What\u2019s a fair profit margin for an energy supplier to make? Centrica, which owns British Gas, has always argued that 5% is about right, so presumably it would see no problem in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/31/big-energy-firms-profit-profit-ofgem-big-six-electricity-gas-switch\">regulator Ofgem\u2019s finding that the average in sector was 4.5% last year</a>.</p> <p>To outside eyes, however, an average of 4.5% (and 7.2% for British Gas itself) will look rich. The big supermarkets rub along on about 2%-3% these days and Tesco\u2019s previous attempt to sustain 5% was self-defeating since it allowed Aldi and Lidl into the market.</p> <p>Comparisons between different industries with different investment profiles are problematic, of course. But common sense says a commodity business like energy supply should not make more than a well-run supermarket. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/12/may-energy-price-cap-ofgem-electricity-gas-tariffs\">looming price cap on energy bills</a> is an imperfect solution \u2013 but one can see why the firms brought it on themselves.</p>",

The agency, which along with Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s was widely condemned for awarding triple-A ratings to sub-prime mortgage books before the 2008 financial crisis, said the British property market is more resilient than is widely believed. Moody\u2019s economist Colin Ellis said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen quite the negative impact from the Brexit referendum that some had forecast, but then we weren\u2019t as bearish as the OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] or the NIESR [National Institute of Economic and Social Research]. \u201cThe [property] market is holding up OK. There is an underlying resilience in prices even if transaction activity has been affected. If you look at the balance between the cost of renting or buying, then UK house prices are not overexposed. \u201cShocks are being dealt with, and even in the event of a Brexit no-deal, then it\u2019s not looking like the UK economy falling off a sharp cliff.\u201d On Thursday the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in 10 years from 0.25% to 0.5%. But Moody\u2019s said it was relaxed about the impact on households and their ability to continue paying mortgages. \u201cWe have expected a rate rise for some time. This is about taking away emergency stimulus introduced after the referendum vote. A rise of 25 basis points [0.25%] is not going to move the dial. A rise of 0.25% pales into insignificance compared to the 8%-10% decline in the currency.\u201d Estate agents, faced with the first rate hike for a decade, have been keenly talking up the housing market. Russell Quirk of eMoov said: \u201cAny increase in monthly payments, like interest rates themselves, will be marginal and manageable for those impacted. On the typical \u00a3150,000 loan, homeowners will be out of pocket around \u00a315 to \u00a330 a month, certainly no grounds to shout \u2018financial meltdown\u2019. \u201cHouse price growth and the market\u2019s overall stability have been incredibly resilient despite the EU vote and a snap general election. A few quid added to the average mortgage repayment will not deter this growth in the medium to long term.\u201d However, Moody\u2019s warned that buy to let is the weak link in the property market. It said it expected a rise in arrears and defaults within packages of buy-to-let mortgage loans, particularly on borrowing in recent years. It warned landlords to expect falling rental income, particularly in London and the south-east, while rising taxes will also make it more difficult for landlords to cover their mortgage payments. \u201cLandlords will have much less wiggle room,\u201d said Moody\u2019s analyst Annabel Schaafsma. \u201cArrears will go up, although the increases will not be astronomical and they are increasing from a low base.\u201d Most books of UK mortgages which have been packaged up as instruments to be traded on markets remain triple-A-rated, said Moody\u2019s.

      "bodyText": "Positive eurozone economic data in the form of strong third quarter growth figures and falling unemployment meant a fairly positive end to the month for European equities. Most markets managed to close higher, although Germany\u2019s Dax was closed for a public holiday. In the US, investors were more focused on this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting than upbeat consumer confidence figures, but Wall Street still managed to make slight gains after an uncertain start. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 5.27 points or 0.07% at 7493.08 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.18% better at 5503.29 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was up 0.18% at 22,793.69 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.74% better at 10,523.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.12% to 759.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 17 points or 0.08%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The continuing dispute between Spain and Catalan separatists should have no immediate effect on the country\u2019s sovereign debt ratings, says S&amp;P Global. The agency said that the \u201corderly application of Article 155 [removing Catalonia\u2019s regional government from office] and the frontloading of regional elections have reduced the likelihood of a short-term escalation of tensions.\u201d It said it did not believe Catalan independence would take place: As we expected, no national government has recognized Catalonia as an independent state. The most prominent credit risk we continue to see is that the related tensions could lead to a sustained drop in business and consumer confidence and potential business disruption from fourth-quarter 2017 onward, especially in Catalonia. While the economic consequences of these developments have yet to emerge, Spain\u2019s most recent economic data were positive. In third-quarter 2017, GDP growth remained robust at 0.8%, while the unemployment rate fell to 16.4%, the lowest level since 2008. This confirms our expectation of Spain\u2019s strong economic performance. US markets are more focused on this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting than the positive data we have seen today. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite a very good afternoon for data the Dow Jones and dollar were reticent to do much this Tuesday, investors holding back ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Fed statement. The CB consumer confidence reading smashed expectations, coming in at 125.9 against the 121.1 forecast and the 120.6 seen in September (itself revised higher from the initial estimate). The Chicago PMI was also pretty muscular; at 66.2 it hit its best level in around 3 years. Yet off the back of these numbers the Dow Jones could only rise 0.1%, while the greenback actually fell 0.3% against the pound. That\u2019s likely because investors are a bit nervy ahead of the week\u2019s Fed meeting. While a December hike seems pretty much locked on \u2013 with the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool pointing to a 98.2% chance of a rate rise in the festive month \u2013 the market will still be looking for a firmly hawkish statement from Janet Yellen on Wednesday. Elsewhere the FTSE saw its daily gains shrink to just 0.1% as the afternoon wore on, leaving the index once again the wrong side of 7500. Sterling, on the other hand, stretched its legs against the euro, doubling its growth to 0.4%, while cable climbed back above $1.325, as investors continue to focus on Thursday\u2019s BoE rate vote. Over in Greece, and there is some good news for the country from this morning\u2019s eurozone jobs figures. Helena Smith reports: Greek unemployment dropped to 21 % in July [the latest data available] according to the European statistics agency (Eurostat), with the number of jobless Greeks at 1.01m. Of that number 17.5 % were men and 25.3 percent women, it said. At the height of Greece\u2019s debt crisis four years ago, unemployment nudged 28 % spurring a massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of qualified Greek abroad. The jobless rate among those under the age of 25 also dropped from 43% in June to 42.8%. Meanwhile, well-placed finance ministry officials say the government is also planning a second foray into the bond market possibly as early as next month, before Greece completes a third bailout review with the international bodies keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. News of the prospective foray, in effect a second test run, would prepare Athens for exit from its current bailout programme which expires in less than a year. Greece successfully put its toe back into bond market for the first time since 2014 in July but analysts insist that real economic recovery will only come when its staggering debt pile is ultimately tackled. More on the UK crackdown on fixed-odds betting terminals in bookmakers shops. Here\u2019s our latest report from Rob Davies: And here\u2019s Rob on BBC Radio Scotland talking about the issue (from about 49.45). US investors seem to be playing its safe ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. Despite further upbeat trading statements from the likes of Kellogg and Mastercard, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually unchanged, down 0.74 points, while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.16% and the Nasdaq Composite has slipped 0.01%. European markets are generally flat too, although Spain\u2019s Ibex is up another 0.5% as fears over the Catalan independence threat continue to recede. Germany\u2019s Dax meanwhile is closed for a holiday. On the confidence figures, Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said: Consumer confidence increased to its highest level in almost 17 years (Dec. 2000, 128.6) in October after remaining relatively flat in September. Consumers\u2019 assessment of current conditions improved, boosted by the job market which had not received such favorable ratings since the summer of 2001. Consumers were also considerably more upbeat about the short-term outlook, with the prospect of improving business conditions as the primary driver. Confidence remains high among consumers, and their expectations suggest the economy will continue expanding at a solid pace for the remainder of the year. These positive US figures come as the Federal Reserve holds its latest monetary policy meeting, and while no rise in interest rates is expected this month, all the signs point to an increase in December. (By then we should also know the name of the next Fed chair, with Donald Trump set to announce his appointee sometime this week.) Over in the US, and consumers were more confident than expected in October. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index came in at 125.9, better than the 121 figure forecast by analysts. It was also higher than September\u2019s 120.6, itself revised upwards from 119.8, and the best level since December 2000. Earlier there were also positive manufacturing figures from Chicago. The purchasing managers index rose from 65.2 in September to 66.2, better than the expected fall to 61. Right, time for a quick recap.... The Eurozone is on track to grow faster than America and the UK this year, after reporting better-than-expected growth figures over the last quarter. Eurozone GDP grew by 0.6% in the three months to September, faster than expected and beating the UK\u2019s 0.4% growth. On an annual basis, the eurozone economy expanded by 2.5% during the last quarter - which is its fastest rate since the first three months of 2011. Economists say the recovery seems to be strengthening. In another boost, the eurozone unemployment rate fell to 8.9%, as the expanding economy helped people to find work. Robert Gordon, CEO of Hitachi Capital UK, says British businesses should look for growth opportunities in the euro area. \u201cIt is easy for businesses to fall into the trap of over-cautiousness when the UK\u2019s own growth rate is slower, but capitalising on Eurozone successes now will help companies to secure their future. Businesses can and should be doing as much as they can to drive up productivity and activity through positive investment in both people and assets, taking advantage of positive economic conditions to help them navigate successfully through times of uncertainty, and emerge in a position of strength.\u201d The day began with solid growth figures from France, which grew by 0.5% during the last quarter. Like the wider eurozone, France racked up its best annual growth since the early days of the euro debt crisis (when Greece was being bailed out and the Italian government was faltering). It grew by 2.2% compared with Q3 2016, while the UK only grew by 1.5% over the same time. Experts say France moved into a higher gear. Domestic demand drove the growth, with household spending and business investment both up. Austria also had a decent summer, expanding by 0.8%. Canada, though, seems to be slowing. It\u2019s GDO shrank by 0.1% in August, after stagnating in July. Hello..... sterling is suddenly pushing higher against the euro. The pound has gained almost 0.5% against the single currency to a one-month high of \u20ac1.138. This follows reports that the European Union\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, ha said he\u2019s ready to speed up negotiations with the UK. Newsflash: Canada\u2019s economy unexpectedly contracted, a little, in August. Canadian GDP shrank by 0.1% in August, due to a decline in mining and manufacturing output. Canada\u2019s good-producing sector shrank by 0.7% during August, wiping out a 0.1% rise in service sector output. Economists had expected GDP to rise by 0.1% in August, having been flat in July as the strong growth recorded earlier this year has faded. Unless something remarkable happened in September, Canada\u2019s Q3 growth rate is going to struggle to match other advanced economies. That has hurt the Canadian dollar, which is now falling against the US dollar. High street retailer John Lewis has fuelled worries about UK consumer spending, by posting its fifth weekly fall in sales in a row. Takings at John Lewis\u2019s department stores fell by 4.0% year-on-year in the seven days to Saturday 28th October. That includes a 1.9% drop in fashion sales, and a 7% slump in sales of electronics and home technology. Last week, the CBI warned that retailers were reporting the biggest drop in demand since the recession.... Not only is the eurozone enjoying faster growth than Britain, it\u2019s also experiencing less inflation. The consumer prices index, which tracks the cost of living, rose by just 1.4% per annum this month, according to new data released this morning. That\u2019s down from 1.5% in September. In contrast, Britain\u2019s inflation rate hit 3% in September, and the Bank of England expects it kept rising in October. So with inflation down, unemployment down and growth up, the eurozone does look rather healthier than a few years ago: It may be Halloween, but there\u2019s nothing scary in today\u2019s eurozone growth figures, says Kathleen Brooks of City Index: Eurozone growth is pretty broad-based right now, adding weight to the argument that the Eurozone\u2019s economic recovery is well entrenched. Spain, for all of its political woes related to Catalonia\u2019s bid for independence, posted a 3.1% GDP rate for Q3, while France saw growth beat expectations and reach 2.2% for last quarter. We are still waiting to hear about growth rates in other major nations such as Germany and Italy, if they can post rates around this level then the mood music in Brussels is likely to be good. The eurozone economy is benefitting from strong domestic demand, thanks to record low interest rates, says Raj Badiani, director at IHS Markit: Households are experiencing a more supportive climate, characterized by still-cheap credit, while lower-than-expected inflation rates have limited the anticipated squeeze on household purchasing power during second and third quarters. Additionally, still-rising employment and a retreating unemployment rate have lifted both household confidence and spending across the region in the first three quarters of 2017. We\u2019ve plotted the eurozone\u2019s quarterly growth figures alongside the UK\u2019s own GDP figures, to show how Europe powered ahead this year. The long-awaited fall in eurozone unemployment is helping to drive growth this year, says Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Ulster Bank\u2019s economists say the eurozone recovery is stronger than expected: Ben Chu of the Independent shows how Europe\u2019s growth rate overtook the UK a year ago: Philip Shaw of Investec thinks the eurozone could outpace America this year, as well as the UK. (last week we learned that US GDP grew by 2.3% over the last 12 months, so a little slower than the eurozone). The eurozone has just posted its fastest annual growth rate since the beginning of the debt crisis, partly due to France\u2019s strong performance. That means the eurozone has outpaced Britain this year, as UK GDP only expanded by 1.5% over the last 12 months (as explained at 7.32am). Breaking! The eurozone grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of this year. That\u2019s a stronger reading than expected. In another boost, growth in the second quarter has been revised up to 0.7%, from 0.6%. On an annual basis, the eurozone expanded by 2.5% -- a healthy rate, which underlines that the European economy has enjoyed quite a sparkling 2017. The latest unemployment figures also show an improvement -- the euro area jobless rate has dropped to 8.9% for September, the lowest since the start of 2009. Newsflash: Fashion chain Burberry have just announced that its chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey, is leaving. Thats\u2019s a surprise. It\u2019s only three months since Bailey relinquished the CEO\u2019s chair to Marco Gobbetti, a move that was meant to allow Bailey to focus on creative matters. Bailey has received wide acclaim over the years for transforming Burberry into a global fashion house, so this could be a blow to the company. As chairman Sir John Peace puts it: \u201cChristopher is a unique talent and an exceptional person\u201d, who has worked as a \u201cgreat partner\u201d at the firm. Shareholders may be concerned. Burberry\u2019s shares have fallen by 2% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard..... In other news, the UK government has outlined its plans to protect gamblers from fixed-odds betting terminals. Under the plan, the maximum bet could be cut from \u00a3100 to just \u00a32 (or possibly to \u00a350, which seems rather less radical).... Here\u2019s another neat chart, which suggests France\u2019s economy has shifted into a higher gear: Barclays economics team agree, saying: We think the French economy is poised to grow solidly next year, projecting 1.9% (consensus: 1.7%), with investment likely to provide increasing support to private consumption, the main growth engine. Richard Turnill, BlackRock\u2019s global chief investment strategist, is concerned that the UK is lagging behind other advanced economies such as France. He believes Brexit uncertainty is weighing the economy down, meaning Britain faces a \u2018tough slog\u2019. Turnill says: The UK\u2019s muted growth outlook stands in stark contrast to 2016, when the UK sat close to the top of G7 growth charts alongside Germany. Brexit negotiations in particular are weighing on the UK economy. Significant progress on three key issues is needed for discussions to move on to the post-Brexit trade relationship between the UK and European Union (EU): the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa, the UK\u2019s financial obligations to the EU, and the Irish border. Progress has been made in recent weeks on these issues, but not enough to advance talks, the EU leaders concluded at their recent summit. Reuters have a good first take on this morning\u2019s French growth figures, for anyone just tuning in: The French economy grew 0.5% in the third quarter from the previous three months as consumer spending picked up and investment remained robust, the INSEE national statistics agency said on Tuesday in a first estimate. The result, which was spot in line with a Reuters poll of 27 analysts, meant gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 2.2% over a year, the fastest pace of growth since 2011. Upward revisions in the second quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year - both by 0.1 percentage point to 0.6% - gave a growth carry-over of 1.7%, the performance for 2017 if growth was zero in the final quarter. Following the economy\u2019s performance over the first nine months, President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government should have little trouble surpassing the 1.7% growth forecast it built its budget plans on. Barclays have also hailed France\u2019s growth performance: Newsflash: Austria\u2019s economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter of this year. That matches the country\u2019s growth rate in the second quarter, and is a pretty decent result. It means Austria is growing as fast as Spain (and rather faster than both France and the UK). WIFO, the think tank which compiled the report, says the recovery is \u201cbroad-based\u201d, with foreign trade and domestic demand both growing. On an annual basis, Austria\u2019s economy is motoring along nicely with 2.6% growth. Holder Sandte, economist at Nordea Markets, believes France\u2019s domestic economy strengthened over the summer: Today\u2019s report is fresh confirmation that France\u2019s economy has outperformed the UK this year French GDP grew by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2017, then 0.6% in Q2, and then 0.5% in Q3. In contrast, the UK\u2019s economy only expanded by 0.3% in the first and second quarters of this year, rising to 0.4% in the last three months. That\u2019s why France\u2019s annual growth rate, at 2.2%, is so much better than the UK\u2019s 1.5%. INSEE says that France\u2019s annual growth rate, of 2.2%, is the strongest since 2011 -- when the eurozone debt crisis was exploding. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Deen is impressed by France\u2019s performance over the last year: Economist Fred Ducrozet, of Swiss bank Pictet, agrees that the recovery is on track: Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics reckons that Paris is now going \u2018toe to toe\u2019 with Berlin in the growth stakes: (reminder, we get German GDP on 14th November) Today\u2019s growth report shows that French household spending accelerated in the last three months, from 0.3% to 0.5%. Businesses also kept spending on new machinery and equipment; \u2018gross fixed capital formation\u2019 rose by 0.8% during the quarter. Inventory changes also boosted growth,as firms stocked up on new raw materials and components. But, foreign trade was a drag on growth. Imports accelerated sharply (+2.5% after +0.2%) while exports decelerated significantly (+0.7% after +2.3%). INSEE says that France imported more transport equipment during the quarter, but sold fewer manufacturing goods abroad. BREAKING: France\u2019s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u2019s the fifth quarter of growth in a row, as the French recovery continues to gather pace. Consumer spending and business investment drove French growth during the quarter, says statistics body INSEE. In another boost for president Emmanuel Macron, the growth rate in the second quarter of 2017 has been revised up to 0.6%, from 0.5%. The French economy has grown by 2.2% over the last 12 months. That\u2019s the strongest annual growth rate since 2011, I think.... It\u2019s also rather stronger than the UK, which only grew by 1.5% over the last 12 months (and 0.4% in the third quarter). I\u2019ll pull details and reaction together now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European politicians and top officials will be hoping to avoid any Halloween shocks today, as the region\u2019s economy comes under the microscope. Yes, it\u2019s Eurozone GDP day, when we find out how fast Europe\u2019s recovery continued in the third quarter of 2017. Economists predict that the eurozone\u2019s quarterly growth rate dipped to 0.5% in Q3, from the almost-boisterous 0.6% recorded in April-June. If so, that would beat the UK, which grew by 0.4% in the same period. As well as the headline eurozone growth figure, at 10am GMT, we\u2019re also getting data from France and Austria. Alas, we\u2019ll have to wait until next month for other heavyweights like Germany and Italy. We\u2019ve already seen some signs that Europe did well in the third quarter - yesterday, Spain posted 0.8% growth in the last three months. But that\u2019s not all.... we also get new eurozone inflation and unemployment figures this morning. This splurge of data should give us a good picture of how the economy is faring. Later today, Canada also posts growth figures. It\u2019s also going to be a busy morning for airline news, with budget operator Ryanair and manufacturer Airbus both reporting results. Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to open fairly flat, as traders watch for political drama in America following yesterday\u2019s indictments of three of Donald Trump\u2019s former aides: October\u2019s been a good month for shares, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Despite the fallout from a new series of political surprises across Europe, the Teflon rally that we\u2019ve seen since the beginning of the year shows no signs of slowing down apart from the occasional pause, with markets across Europe set to post significant gains in another good month for stocks. Here\u2019s the agenda: 6.30am GMT: French GDP for the third quarter of 2017 8am GMT: Austrian GDP for the third quarter of 2017 10am GMT: Eurozone GDP for the third quarter of 2017 10am GMT: Eurozone flash inflation rate for October 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment figures for September 12.30pm GMT: Canadian GDP for August",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biggest energy companies made a profit of \u00a31bn last year and have increased their profit margins in recent years despite losing millions of customers to challenger firms, according to Ofgem \u2013 the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets. The energy regulator said the big six suppliers enjoyed a healthy margin of 4.5% on average in 2016 by charging higher prices to consumers who have not switched, with the gap between the best and worst tariffs widening to \u00a3300 a year. Almost half of people who are unemployed or in low-skilled work have never switched supplier, a new report by the regulator found (pdf). For other customers, the figure is below a third. \u201cSupplier margins have been rising fairly significantly over the last seven years or so,\u201d said Joe Perkins, Ofgem\u2019s chief economist. \u201cSome of that increased margin is clearly down to increased cost efficiencies but the level of [consumer] engagement also plays a role.\u201d The regulator found that if energy suppliers made the same profit on poorer-value standard variable tariffs as they did on cheaper fixed-term deals, the big six would have posted a loss of 6% last year. British Gas made the biggest profit margin last year, at 7.2%, followed by E.ON with 7%, SSE with 6.9% and Scottish Power with 5.2%. Npower and EDF both made a loss. \u201cLess-engaged consumers appear to allow suppliers to offer very competitive prices to engaged consumers and still make a profit after deducting their operating costs,\u201d the report said. Theresa May has cited the higher prices for those who have not shopped around as the reason for her price cap on standard variable tariffs. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: \u201cThe regulator\u2019s report shows there are still millions of people paying too much for their energy. \u201cWhile it is positive to see 1 million fewer people are on poor-value tariffs this year, it is not right that the majority of people remain on them.\u201d First Utility, one of the biggest challenger firms, said the report was further evidence of why ministers were capping prices. \u201cIt [a cap] is the inevitable consequence of the big six\u2019s lack of regard for their customers and they only have themselves to blame,\u201d said Ed Kamm, the company\u2019s chief commercial officer. However, the \u00a31bn profit is down from the peak of \u00a31.2bn, with smaller suppliers driving the big six\u2019s market share down to 80%. \u201cProfit in absolute terms has been falling for the six largest suppliers as they\u2019ve been losing customers to smaller firms, so whilst they\u2019re making a stable or increasing margin on revenues they earn, that revenue base has fallen somewhat as new entrants are coming in,\u201d said Perkins. Ofgem said it was pleased that households were using a fifth less energy than a decade ago, largely because of improvements in energy efficiency such as insulation and better boilers. But the regulator is concerned that some people are rationing their use of gas for heating, such as by turning down the thermostat. It believes a third of the reduction in gas consumption over the last 10 years is a result of consumers limiting their heating in response to price hikes. \u201cSelf-rationing is a particular risk for low-income consumers,\u201d said Perkins. While May\u2019s wider cap is unlikely to take effect until 2019, Ofgem said that a narrower cap on 4m vulnerable households had reduced typical dual fuel bills by \u00a360 a year since being imposed in April. However, the regulator found the cheapest tariffs had been withdrawn and most suppliers had converged with pricing just under the cap. It would not be drawn on whether May\u2019s cap would have the same effect. Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at comparison site uSwitch.com, said: \u201cPrices have converged around the level of the prepayment price cap and Ofgem acknowledges that some consumers have seen their bills rise due to the cheapest deals being withdrawn. \u201cOne of the risks of applying a cap to the wider retail market is that the competitive forces which drive prices down will be squeezed out, leaving customers with nowhere to go to escape expensive tariffs or poor service.\u201d Ofgem\u2019s state of the market report also said the cost of keeping the lights on in recent years could have been cheaper for consumers if National Grid had more accurately forecast the number of power stations required to be on standby during winter. Another area where households had sometimes paid \u201ca higher cost \u2026 than necessary\u201d was for policies cutting carbon emissions from energy, the report said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t come cheap,\u201d said Perkins, of the subsidies paid by consumers to support windfarms and solar panels in recent years.",

    "webTitle": "Christopher Bailey: how Burberry's creative force transformed the brand", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Christopher Bailey, who turned Burberry from an ailing rainwear label into a global luxury brand, is to check out of the company in 2018 after 17 years at the helm. Burberry shares fell 2% after the news that Bailey\u2019s next Burberry show, which will be held in London in February, will be his last. His departure leaves a plum vacancy for a new designer at Britain\u2019s biggest fashion brand. While the phrasing of the announcement was intended to soothe nervous shareholders, emphasising a smooth transition in which Bailey will remain with the company for a transition period lasting the remainder of 2018, eyebrows were raised at its timing, which comes just three months after Burberry appointed a new CEO, Marco Gobbetti. Gobbetti was hired from C\u00e9line this summer after an unsuccessful experiment in which Bailey attempted to steer both the boardroom and the design studio. Bailey\u2019s exit is much more significant than run-of-the-mill reshuffling in the restless fashion industry. Moves are two a penny, with talent flitting between brands in a neverending game of musical chairs, but the length of Bailey\u2019s tenure and the scope of his transformation of Burberry means that his name is virtually synonymous with the brand. This makes speculation on who will replace him difficult, although the brand\u2019s strongly British identity make a native appointment most likely. Phoebe Philo, the British designer with whom Gobbetti partnered at C\u00e9line, is one name being mentioned, as is Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen, and the newly appointed Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy. All three are based with their families in London and might be tempted to swap Paris fashion week for a shorter commute. However, Burberry may follow the lead of the most successful designer of this decade, that of Alessandro Michele at Gucci, and make an internal appointment. \u201cBurberry encapsulates so much of what is great about Britain,\u201d said Bailey on Monday. \u201cIt is creative, innovative and outward-looking. It celebrates diversity and challenges received wisdoms.\u201d The strength of his attachment to the label was evident in his description of the tenure as \u201cthe great privilege of my working life\u201d. Gobbetti paid tribute to the departing designer, saying he was \u201csad not to have had the opportunity to partner with him for longer\u201d. Bailey transformed Burberry in both aesthetic and financial terms, but most of all he transformed it in tone. In 2001, Burberry was a heritage rainwear brand that had become the butt of tabloid jokes after its distinctive check was adopted on football terraces and by soap opera stars not feted for their elegance. Bailey built a new identity, based closely on the trenchcoat. He streamlined the silhouette into a more feminine and flattering shape, upgraded the fabric, elevated the styling, and enlisted supermodels to make the \u201ctrench\u201d a fashion star. Kate Moss wore one on the cover of British Vogue in 2009, as did the Duchess of Cambridge on the 100th birthday edition of Vogue in 2016. Actors Sienna Miller and Claire Danes have each worn a Burberry trench on the cover of the US edition of Vogue. The Burberry trenchcoat became a sought-after and highly lucrative trophy piece. It also served as a crucial plot device in the story Bailey was telling the world about Burberry, which framed the brand as a glossy, romantic, modern version of Britishness. Nothing, after all, is more British than rain. In February 2012, the finale to the Burberry catwalk show was soundtracked by a crack of thunder, followed by rain falling on to a perspex roof from a simulated storm engineered above the catwalk in Hyde Park. Enthusiasm for new technology enabled Burberry, which was the first luxury brand to embrace Snapchat, to build fans among the next generation of consumers. But fashion is voracious in its hunger for newness, and Burberry inevitably lost its ability to thrill. In hindsight, the apex of Bailey\u2019s Burberry story came in about 2009, when he was named British designer of the year and awarded an MBE. In 2014, he faced a backlash after his powers were extended into an unconventional dual role of designer and CEO. Almost 53% of shareholders voted against a remuneration package adding up to \u00a315m, questioning the wisdom of two roles with different skillsets being undertaken by one person. This year, Bailey relinquished the CEO job, but retained the title of president. The resulting situation was queried by some investors, who pointed out that the company was in effect paying two CEO-level salaries. Bailey, 46, lives in London with his husband, the actor Simon Woods, and their two young daughters. His statement gave no hint of his future plans, beyond that he was \u201cexcited to pursue new creative projects\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The advertising group WPP has lowered its growth forecasts for the third time this year amid shrinking client budgets, but said its UK business was benefiting from Brexit uncertainty. Sir Martin Sorrell, the WPP chief executive, said the UK market was stronger than other parts of the world as firms opted to invest in advertising and marketing campaigns rather than commit to major spending on buildings and machinery. \u201cIt is slightly perverse because increased uncertainty is driving variable investment rather than fixed capital investment, which is not good for the long-term economy but has a temporary benefit for us,\u201d he said. He made the comments as WPP published its third-quarter trading update, revealing a second successive quarterly fall in like-for-like sales, which were down by 1.1%. The company said cost-cutting among clients, including those in the consumer goods sector, was having an impact on business. The global group said like-for-like net sales and operating margins would both be flat this year, lower than the respective growth of up to 1% and 0.3% it was predicting in August. Sorrell said the shift to \u201cthe new normal of a low growth, low inflation, limited pricing power world\u201d, was driving greater focus on reducing costs, while ultra-low borrowing costs were encouraging intervention from activist investors that tends to result in squeezed budgets. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said WPP was having a \u201cdifficult year\u201d. \u201cThe group says the main cause of the slowdown is a change in spending patterns at big companies. Unilever\u2019s focus on margin and Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s zero-based budgeting are two high-profile consumer goods examples, and we can see how this has put the squeeze on the world\u2019s biggest advertising agency. \u201cAn increased focus on high-growth areas like emerging markets and digital media makes sense to us, but there\u2019s no denying a weak third quarter has put pressure on the group to finish the year strongly. While it\u2019s not time to hit the panic button, one has to worry whether things might get worse before they get better.\u201d Sorrell said that major events planned for 2018 could potentially help to offset the broader trend of shrinking advertising budgets. \u201cWhilst it is too early to comment on prospects for 2018 as three-year plans and budgets are in the course of preparation, any further marketing investment reduction may well be countered by the mini-quadrennial events of 2018 \u2013 the Winter Olympics in South Korea; the Fifa World Cup in Russia; and the mid-term congressional elections in the United States,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Christopher Bailey, who stepped down as Burberry chief executive in July after investor unease, is to leave the company by the end of next year with an expected payout of up to \u00a312m. Shares in the luxury goods retailer, renowned for its trenchcoats and distinctive check print, fell more than 2% initially, although they recovered some ground to close 1% lower. Bailey was credited with helping transform Burberry from a small UK company into a global fashion brand, building its digital presence by streaming its fashion shows live and redesigning its flagship stores. Bailey will receive his salary, pension and contractual cash allowance and non-cash benefits until the end of 2018, but no cash bonus will be paid for the period after March. This is worth about \u00a31.9m. In addition he is entitled to share awards that could be worth up to \u00a310m. But he is surrendering various other share awards given as part of the company\u2019s incentive plans, valued at \u00a316m. Bailey has been with Burberry for 17 years and its chief creative designer since 2009. In May 2014 he also became chief executive after tAngela Ahrendts left to join Apple. Investors initially backed Bailey in his dual role, but anxiety over his leadership began to grow after flagging sales, especially in key markets such as China and the Middle East. There were also protests against his pay packet, which rose from \u00a31.9m to \u00a33.5m last year, while he also received \u00a310.5m in shares in July. As a result, Burberry appointed the luxury goods veteran Marco Gobbetti as chief executive, with Bailey given the title of president to add to his chief creative officer role. In a statement, Burberry said Bailey would step down in March 2018 to pursue new creative projects, but would provide support to Gobbetti until the end of next year. Gobbetti has been with Burberry since January and formally took over as chief executive in July. Sources said the two had been working together on strategy, but Bailey felt with the new leadership in place it was time to move on. Bailey said the decision to leave was not an easy one. He added: \u201cI do truly believe, however, that Burberry\u2019s best days are still ahead of her and that the company will go from strength to strength with the strategy we have developed.\u201d Gobbetti said he was sad \u201cnot to have the opportunity to partner with [Bailey] for longer\u201d but he had enormous confidence in the company\u2019s future. Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said it was negative news for the company but pointed to Phoebe Philo at the LVMH-owned C\u00e9line \u2013 Gobbetti\u2019s previous employers \u2013 as a possible replacement for Bailey. Fujimori said: \u201cWe view this as a near-term net negative for the stock given Mr Bailey\u2019s long-term track record and investors\u2019 renewed hopes that the brand would regain its mojo as Mr Bailey would focus on his creative role (which is what he does best) since Marco Gobbetti took over the chief executive role last July. \u201cMarket participants are now speculating on a potential high-profile name in the fashion world taking over the creative role at Burberry to open a new chapter for the brand. \u201cMany investors are inevitably linking today\u2019s news to recent unsubstantiated press reports from Business of Fashion, which reported on 17 October that LVMH was interviewing designers to replace C\u00e9line director Phoebe Philo, who has been at C\u00e9line for the last 10 years and worked many years with \u2026 Gobbetti, successfully turning around C\u00e9line.\u201d Charlotte Pearce, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cIt is crucial that Burberry finds someone with respect for the brand\u2019s British heritage but who is able to further evolve the label creatively and bring it into a new era.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair is on course for record annual profits despite a rota fiasco that led to pilot shortages and the cancellation of thousands of flights. The Dublin-based airline said it had responded swiftly to the crisis which could cost up to \u20ac50m (\u00a344m) and add about \u20ac100m to its annual wage bill after the rostering failure forced it to address a dispute with pilots over pay and working conditions. Profits after tax rose 11% to \u20ac1.29bn in the six months to 30 September. The chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said it was still targeting a range of \u20ac1.4bn to \u20ac1.45bn for the full year. Shares rose 4%. Ryanair has cancelled flights affecting 700,000 customers from September 2017 through to March 2018. Some routes have been suspended for winter, including London Stansted to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Gatwick to Belfast, Newcastle to Faro, and Glasgow to Las Palmas. \u201cThe test of any management team is the speed and effectiveness with which they respond to a crisis, and the pilot rostering failure in early September was just such a crisis,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe have responded quickly to repair this failure, eliminate further cancellations and we are determined to invest the time, money and manpower to ensure that it never recurs.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that Ryanair\u2019s latest results \u201chave the usual swagger, with just a hint of contrition over September\u2019s rostering fiasco\u201d. \u201cThe numbers show little signs of weakness, but the reporting period only covers the start of the problems encountered by Ryanair, so further costs could arise. Ryanair isn\u2019t blinking though, and has maintained its profit forecast for the year. \u201cThe airline can do this because it\u2019s putting more bums on seats, and each bum is costing that little bit less to fly because fuel costs are falling. What\u2019s more, passengers appear to be splashing out a bit more on extras like priority boarding and reserved seating.\u201d O\u2019Leary also used the report as an opportunity to predict the failure of more rival European airlines, after Monarch collapsed earlier this month. \u201cThe underlying trend towards consolidation among European airlines continues. Monarch went bankrupt in September, followed by Air Berlin in October and Alitalia remains in bankruptcy. There are other financially troubled EU airlines who will, we believe, follow them.\u201d He said the failures were creating more opportunities in those European markets. O\u2019Leary repeated Ryanair\u2019s concerns over a lack of clarity on any Brexit deal with the EU, warning that the UK government underestimated the likelihood of major disruption in flights unless a deal was struck. \u201cThere remains a worrying risk of a serious disruption to UK-EU flights in April 2019 unless a timely UK-EU bilateral is agreed in advance of September 2018. We, like other airlines, need clarity on this issue before we publish our summer 2019 schedules in mid-2018 and time is running short for the UK to develop a bilateral solution.\u201d Ryanair fares dipped by 5% over the first half of the year but passengers opting to pay for extras such as reserved seating and priority boarding helped offset this decline. Fares for the full-year are expected to fall by 4% to 6%, partly because the failure of rival airlines has cut competition.",

      "bodyText": "Asda has parted company with its chief executive after only 18 months, despite recent signs that a trend of falling sales, amid a price war with discounters Lidl and Aldi, was being arrested. The supermarket chain, whose US parent, Walmart, is the world\u2019s largest company by revenue, said Asda\u2019s chief executive, Sean Clarke, would be replaced by his deputy, Roger Burnley. Despite the fact that Clarke has led Asda since July last year, the Walmart chief executive, David Cheesewright, said the handover of power had always been in the company\u2019s plans. \u201cRoger was brought back to Asda to partner with Sean ahead of the transition to Roger taking up the position of CEO,\u201d he said. \u201cHe and Sean have worked as a great team and I\u2019m really confident in Roger\u2019s ability to continue building upon our returning momentum.\u201d He added that Clarke would \u201cremain engaged\u201d with Walmart after stepping down and taking some time out. Burnley worked for Asda from 1996 to 2002 and made his return to the company in October 2016, after he was poached from the rival Sainsbury\u2019s, where he was retail and operations director. Asda reported its first quarterly rise in sales for three years in the three months to the end of June. Burnley will be expected to continue implementing the turnaround plan started under his predecessor that Asda hopes will keep its performance on an upward path. The company said in September that it had cut 300 jobs, axing more than one in 10 of its 2,500 head-office staff as part of an aggressive cost-cutting drive. It also changed the job descriptions of a further 800 staff and is reported to be considering thousands more redundancies or imposing reduced hours at underperforming stores. The cutbacks come amid a protracted price war that has engulfed Britain\u2019s highly competitive supermarket industry. Clarke, who will step down in December, was leading efforts to revive Asda\u2019s fortunes and appeared to have stopped a period of long-term decline. Established supermarkets struggled to cope with the rapid expansion of Aldi and Lidl in the UK, which forced them to cut prices on many everyday items. Asda, which had benefited from a reputation for bargains, has suffered more than most from the emergence of the German discounters. Bryan Roberts, the global insights director at TCC Global, the retail marketing firm, said Clarke and Burnley had jointly devised a plan that seemed to be turning the company around, with the latter now entrusted with cementing that progress. \u201cTurning what seems to be tentative stabilisation into a genuine recovery and actually regaining some of the ground they\u2019ve lost over the last few years is going to be a big challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cLonger term, they need to work out what they are going to stand for in the market \u2013 is it around fun, or is it around service? Is it around being a family destination?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown is not alone in thinking errant British bankers got off lightly in the 2008 financial crisis. We should also be worried that the former prime minister thinks the new criminal offence of reckless misconduct that causes a financial institution to fail, which was introduced after the crisis to address the perceived legislative weaknesses, may not be up to the job. For a City audience, however, the jaw-dropper in the extract from Brown\u2019s upcoming book will be his revelation that Barclays, in the midst of the crisis, tried to buy the failed Royal Bank of Scotland. This is astonishing and has not emerged from other front-line accounts, including those of Brown\u2019s former chancellor, Alistair Darling. Brown offers little detail about how seriously Barclays and its then-chief executive, John Varley, pursued the idea. But the mere fact the Barclays\u2019 executives thought RBS could be within their sights speaks volumes about the blind risk-taking of those days. This was October 2008, a month after Barclays had been blocked from attempting to rescue Lehman Brothers because the UK government refused to underwrite the adventure. The following week, however, Barclays had managed to buy Lehman\u2019s US investment banking operation from the receivers for $1.75bn (\u00a31.5bn). In itself, the purchase of the rump of Lehman represented a huge gamble for Barclays. The notion that it could simultaneously have tried to swallow the bust RBS, with its balance sheet many times the size of the UK economy, should have been a non-starter. What were Barclays\u2019 executives thinking? That bagging RBS would be sweet revenge for losing the bidding for ABN Amro the previous year? That the UK government, having ripped up the competition rules to allow Lloyds TSB to buy HBOS, would smile upon another anti-competititive carve-up? The only certainty is that a Barclays/RBS combination would have made the UK\u2019s banking crisis many times worse. RBS has clocked up accumulated losses of \u00a358bn during the clean-up operation, a sum that would have felled Barclays as well. Given what we now know about the toxic assets within RBS \u2013 and, critically, the zero visibility at the time \u2013 it is staggering that Barclays could even have thought about a deal. In the context of the full history of the UK\u2019s banking crisis, Brown\u2019s revelation about a deal that didn\u2019t happen will rank as a footnote. But the tale is intriguing and, if the plan had reached the prime minister\u2019s ears, one assumes there was some substance to it. Let us hope somebody now spills all the beans. Greybull\u2019s loose talks How nice, Greybull Capital, owner of the collapsed Monarch airline, thinks it may have \u201ca moral obligation\u201d to help pay for the cost of flying 84,000 stranded passengers back to the UK. If it ends up making a profit out of Monarch\u2019s fall into administration, Greybull would contribute to the \u00a360m cost of the repatriation. The problem with this promise, however, is that it\u2019s not nailed down. What if Greybull, as the main secured creditor, were to collect, say, \u00a340m from the administration, which is theoretically possible if administrator KPMG is allowed to sell Monarch\u2019s main asset, its take-off and landing slots? What sum would Greybull regard as satisfying its moral obligation? There is a world of difference between handing over a small portion and the whole lot. In one respect, you can\u2019t blame Greybull for being vague. It was mirroring transport secretary Chris Grayling\u2019s form of words when he spoke about creditors who \u201cend up with money in their pocket\u201d having \u201ca moral obligation to contribute\u201d to a bill that was shouldered by the public purse. And the firm is also anxious to sustain its argument that it behaved properly and did not take out dividends, interests and loan repayments since its first investment in Monarch in 2014. All the same, this loose talk about moral obligations needs clarity \u2013 and the earlier the better. Grayling, and the transport select committee, should exert more pressure to get Greybull to define its commitment in terms that it can be held to. Goldman tweets Lloyd Blankfein \u201creally enjoyed\u201d his trip to Frankfurt earlier this month. And, it seems, he really loved the storm created by his tweet that he expects to be spend more time there. On Monday Goldman Sachs\u2019 boss gave the Brexit pot another stir. Alongside a picture of the investment bank\u2019s new \u00a3350m European headquarters off Fleet Street, he tweeted: \u201cExpecting/hoping to fill it up, but so much outside our control.\u201d It\u2019s entertaining stuff, but you have to wonder what Blankfein hopes to gain from these teasing tweets. Over at HBSC, the calculation about the impact of Brexit on the location of jobs seems to be roughly the same: the harder the terms of Brexit, the more jobs will go from London. But compare the delivery of that message. HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver said his bank will wait as a long as possible before shifting jobs out of London but \u201cup to\u201d 1,000 roles could transfer to Paris. That is a sober policy, accompanied by a helpful clarity on numbers. Blankfein, by contrast, prefers veiled threats and ambiguity. Not for the first time, he sounds arrogant.",
