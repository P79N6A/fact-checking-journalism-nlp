      "bodyText": "Britannia Building Society would have collapsed if it had not been taken over by the Co-operative Bank, the Bank of England's chief regulator told MPs. Andrew Bailey said at the height of the financial crisis attention was diverted from Britannia's risky loan book by its merger with the Co-op in 2009. \"Yes, it would have failed. The merger essentially took it out of the limelight and in that sense it achieved its objective,\" Bailey told the Treasury select committee. \"Britannia was one of the building societies in 2008 and 2009 that was in trouble.\" He said Britannia would have been unable to gain funding in the markets because of worries about its commercial property loans and riskier residential mortgages. Lack of market funding was what almost destroyed Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland. A bailout by the government would have also put extra strain on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which repays depositors at failed lenders. That, in turn, would have caused other building societies to fail because they could not have afforded to fund the scheme. The Co-op Bank and Britannia announced their merger in late 2008 and completed it in early 2009, hailing the creation of a \"supermutual\" that would act in its customers' interests while taking on the big banks. The combined bank was led by former Britannia boss Neville Richardson. Though regulators have criticised Britannia before, Bailey's remarks are the first time a regulator has said Britannia would have collapsed. From 2011 the combined bank attempted a takeover of more than 600 Lloyds Banking Group branches. That deal collapsed last April shortly before the Co-op Bank revealed a \u00a31.5bn hole in its balance sheet. The crisis forced the Co-op Group to cede control of 70% of the bank to hedge funds and outside investors before the bank's former chairman Paul Flowers was embroiled in a drug scandal. Bailey said the Co-op's financial woes were mainly caused by Britannia's earlier expansion into lending it was not equipped to manage. He rejected Richardson's claims to MPs last year that the Co-op Bank was the source of most of the problems. MPs asked Bailey why, when he was in charge of bank regulation at the former Financial Services Authority [FSA}, he allowed the Co-op Bank to try to buy the Lloyds branches when he had told the bank it was short of capital. Bailey said it was not his job to run the bank and that if the Co-op had sorted out its finances and governance the deal might have worked. But he admitted the FSA did not have systems in place to run regular and thorough enough \"stress tests\" to spot the extent of the Co-op's problems. After spending lots of money the Bank of England will be able to do so later this year, he said. He also rejected former Co-op Bank executives' claims that the Bank of England changed its rules on capital, suddenly leaving the Co-op Bank with a gaping shortage. The bank already knew it had a \u00a3900m shortfall and had under-reported potential bad debts, Bailey said. Lord Levene, who was chairman of NBNK, which also tried to buy the Lloyds branches, told the committee last month that political interference had scuppered his potential bid. He said former Bank of England governor Lord King had told him NBNK was doomed to fail. Bailey said he had told King before his meeting with Levene in 2012 that there was \"a lot of political interest in the transaction\". Bailey also said the FSA took into account the government's wish for more competition in banking alongside its duty to ensure banks were \"safe and sound\" but he said there was no political pressure. Bailey said he told the Co-op Bank to tell Lloyds about his concerns about its capital position in 2011 and that the Co-op passed his views on. He said he was surprised that Sir Win Bischoff, Lloyds' chairman, had said he was never told about the Co-op's problems.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays faced condemnation on Tuesday after announcing a 10% rise in bonus payouts despite a dramatic fall in profits and plans to cut 12,000 jobs this year. The bank's new boss, Antony Jenkins, came under intense pressure after being accused of failing on promises made only a year ago to clamp down on pay and change the culture of the bank after its \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor. The TUC accused the bank of \"sticking two fingers up to hard-pressed families across Britain\", while the Unite union was furious at further cuts at the retail bank, which could harm customer service. But the harshest words came from the Institute of Directors, whose corporate governance director Roger Barker asked \"for whom is this institution being run?\" after the bank paid out \u00a32.4bn in bonuses but just \u00a3860m in dividends to shareholders. The bank disputes that figure, but refused to say exactly how much it is paying out to shareholders, which has been complicated by last year's \u00a35.8bn rights issue, forced upon Barclays by the Bank of England to boost its financial strength. The main investor body, the Association British of Insurers, refused to respond to Barker's accusation that investors were \"supine\" in failing to control pay at Barclays. The position of the bank's chair of remuneration committee Sir John Sutherland \u2013 appointed to the role only 18 months ago \u2013 was also questioned. Sunderland is entering his 10th year on the board, after which he is technically no longer deemed independent. The total bonus pay for 2013 is \u00a32.4bn \u2013 up from \u00a32.2bn a year ago. Within that, the investment bankers enjoyed bonuses of \u00a31.6bn compared with \u00a31.4bn a year ago, even though their division suffered a loss in the fourth quarter and its annual profits tumbled 37%. Profits across the group, which also includes high street banking, Barclaycard and operations in Africa, fell 32% to \u00a35.2bn. On a statutory basis \u2013 including accounting quirks and other one-off items \u2013 the profits were higher, at \u00a32.9bn. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \"Barclays has stuck two fingers up to hard-pressed families across Britain by announcing another multibillion-pound bonus pool.\" Labour said its bonus tax should be reintroduced. Jenkins, who has waived his own \u00a32.7m bonus, insisted he had the support of shareholders for the higher bonuses, which had to be paid because he had no control over market-led pay. He also insisted the bank was acting within the \"spirit and letter\" of the law by paying monthly \"allowances\" to key staff who might otherwise face pay cuts as a result of the new EU cap on bonuses, which will limit payouts next year to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve. \"We employ people from Singapore to San Francisco. We compete in global markets for talent. If we are to act in the best interests of our shareholders we have to make sure we have the best people in the firm,\" Jenkins said. The average bonus per member of staff, across the bank, is \u00a317,000, up from \u00a315,600. However, the average payout in the investment banking operation is \u00a360,100, up from \u00a354,500 \u2013 including payouts to low level and administrative staff. The bonuses to the highest paid staff will be revealed next month when the bank publishes its annual report. Last year, it handed more than \u00a31m to 428 of its bankers. Jenkins said 820 senior roles \u2013 or 10% \u2013 would be cut. He also disputed concerns about the impact of job cuts on customer service. Seven thousand of the 12,000 job cuts will be in the UK but not all in the high street. \"The reason why we're doing this is not because we're trying to deliver poorer customer service, actually quite the reverse. Customers can now do their banking when its convenient to them, not \u2026 us. Technology allows [us] to reduce headcount,\" said Jenkins. There was no programme for branch closures, he said, but conceded the 1,700-strong network was changing. Vince Cable, the business secretary, said: \"We need a responsible banking sector [that] rejects the bonus-fuelled culture of the past and puts the needs of consumers and businesses at the heart of what they do.\" Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said Barclays' shareholders needed to ask if the pay was justified by the bank's returns to shareholders. Even the presentation to City analysts was dominated by questions about bonuses and the investment bank. \"Analysts were \"perplexed\" and \"disappointed\" by the investment bank pay rises,\" said independent analyst Louise Cooper. A year ago, when Jenkins announced his plan to turn Barclays into the \"go to\" bank, the shares rose 9% to 327p. On Tuesday, they were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, ending nearly 4% lower at 264p. The dividend was held at 6.5p for the year.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap up our live blog coverage of Janet Yellen\u2019s first congressional hearing as Fed chair. If you are still hungry for more \u2013 good news! She\u2019ll be back on Thursday, to testify before the Senate. Yellen\u2019s appearance was notable for its non-notability. She said asset purchasing will \u201clikely\u201d be tapered unless something changes; she said the jobs market is better but not great; she said the Fed will look to the unemployment and inflation rates in setting future interest rates policy. Other tidbits included: \u2022 Yellen said the CBO \u201chas done important analysis\u201d on the likely effects on the economy of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI think they\u2019ve recognized that the impact of the act is likely to be complex. I think they\u2019re still trying to figure out what all of the different channels are by which it will effect the economy,\u201d she said. \u2022 Yellen said she was \u201csurprised that the jobs reports and the January pace of job creation was running under what I had anticipated, but we have to be very careful about jumping to conclusions about what those reports mean.\u201d Bad weather may have been to blame, she said. \u2022 Yellen said land prices are \u201cremarkable\u201d in the eyes of the Fed. \u201cI think land prices have been going up at a remarkable rate even before [the stock market climb], and have caught our attention as an area that we would be concerned about valuations,\u201d she said. \u2022 Yellen acknowledged that including discouraged workers in the unemployment rate lifts it to around 13%, \u201ca much broader measure of shortfall in our economy from what we would like to see.\u201d \u2022 Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony is available on the committee web site. The Dow has floated upward over the course of the day, to reach about +1.37% with 50 minutes of trading to go. Yellen is done. The committee recesses for a floor vote. A panel of economists is to testify next: Dr. John B. Taylor, Mary and Robert Raymond Professor of Economics, Stanford University Dr. Mark A. Calabria, Director, Financial Regulation Studies, Cato Institute Ms. Abby M. McCloskey, Director, Economic Policy, American Enterprise Institute Dr. Donald Kohn, Senior Fellow, Economic Studies, Brookings Institution Yellen is asked about tax policy. Rep. Robert Pittenger wants her to admit that lowering taxes would boost consumer spending. \u201cWell, certainly,\u201d she says. They don\u2019t get into government spending. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina, is exploring the dynamics of a potential US debt default. He wants to know whether, in order to avoid default, the Treasury could prioritize the bills it pays after slamming into the debt ceiling. \u201cThat\u2019s a matter that is entirely up to the Treasury,\u201d Yellen says. \u201cThat is not in the domain of the Federal Reserve... it is not up to us to develop a plan.\u201d Mulvaney asks whether the fed could create such a plan if asked to do so by the Treasury. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we could do that,\u201d Yellen says. Yellen says land prices are \u201cremarkable\u201d in the eyes of the Fed: \u201cI think land prices have been going up at a remarkable rate even before [the stock market climb], and have caught our attention as an area that we would be concerned about valuations.\u201d Moore asks Yellen how the Fed can address income inequality. \u201cOur tool kit I\u2019m afraid is more limited than what\u2019s necessary to deal with these trends,\u201d Yellen says. Bernanke used to say the same. She says the Fed can help get a strong recovery going. Rep. Gwen Moore, Democrat of Wisconsin, thanks Yellen for testifying now coming up on four hours. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the former chair indulging us in this way,\u201d Moore says. \u201cMaybe things will change after you\u2019re here for a time or two.\u201d They\u2019re back. Rep. Bob Hurt, Republican of Virginia, said unemployment in his district, the 5th (south-central), has run as high as 25%. He asks Yellen to talk about policies that can help community banks, not just the big guys. \u201cAs a general philosophy, I don\u2019t agree with one-size-fits-all,\u201d Yellen says. \u201cCommunity banks clearly do not pose the kind of systemic risk to financial stability that the larger banking organizations do.\u201d We\u2019re waiting for them to come back. The committee is taking a half-hour break. This line of questioning from Representative Posey has rendered Yellen speechless. Not because she is stumped. Except maybe by the extreme dazzlement of his leaps of logic and non sequitur. Yellen is still answering questions about auditing the Fed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the Federal Reserve is in any way corrupt, and I believe the confidence of markets... would not be enhanced by that type of audit,\u201d she says. Just two questions left before recess, Hensarling advises. Rep Bill Posey, REpublican of Florida, uses one of them to re-ask the Bachmann question about auditing the Fed. Yellen is asked by Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, Democrat of Missouri, about the U-6 unemployment rate, which takes into account discouraged workers who have left the tallied labor force. The U-6 number is around 13%, Yellen says. \u201cThat is a much broader measure of shortfall in our economy from what we would like to see. Certainly there are discouraged workers, those who are marginally attached. ... That\u2019s a measure that is disproportionately elevated in comparison with the 6.6% or the U-3 unemployment rate. Rep. Stevan Pearce, Republican of New Mexico, invites Yellen to visit his district and take questions from seniors about interest rates at a town hall. She thanks him for the invitation. Rep. Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, is up. Why do you oppose auditing the Fed, she asks Yellen. \u201cI strongly believe that the Federal Reserve should be audited...\u201d Yellen says. \u201cWe are audited. We\u2019re audited by the GAO... we have outside public accounting firms that audit the Fed... we publish our balance sheets weekly...\u201d But don\u2019t interfere with monetary policy by bringing political pressures to bear, Yellen says. Tall order from Rep. David Scott, Democrat of Georgia: \u201cI want a yes-or-no answer. Will you lift employment up? ... We need more than just 0% interest rates.\u201d He does not sound like he will be satisfied unless Yellen vows personally to employ thousands of Americans. She does not vow to do that but reaffirms her general commitment to upholding the Fed\u2019s dual mandate. No news is good news when you\u2019re a central bank chair taking questions from Congress. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: \u2022 In her first Capitol Hill outing as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen said that a recovery in the jobs market was \u201cfar from complete\u201d but the economy has made \u201csubstantial\u201d improvement in the last four years. \u2022 If economic developments are satisfactory, the Fed will \u201clikely reduce\u201d asset purchases, Yellen said, but the program is \u201cnot on a preset course\u201d and could shift as new data comes to light. The next Fed meeting is next month. \u2022 Markets reacted by moving lazily upward, with the Dow up .86% at midday. \u2022 Yellen faced some mild freshman hazing from members of the committee, but nothing that affected her calm, methodical demeanor. Many members congratulated Yellen on her confirmation and praised her historic ascent as the first woman to lead the Fed. Yellen says the recovery has been slow, but there has been progress on unemployment: \u201cIt certainly has been a slow recovery by standards of US history... but 7.8m jobs have been created since the trough of employment... in 2010... we\u2019re not back to maximum employment [but] there has been substantial improvement.\u201d It\u2019s true, Yellen has more than once gone out of her way to disclaim the status of \u201cpanacea\u201d for this or that economic policy. And here are ten other things that are not panaceas. You can almost see Yellen\u2019s Brooklyn accent in this AP photo: Yellen is asked about the CBO report finding that some people may leave the labor market as a result of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cCBO has done important analysis,\u201d Yellen says. \u201cI think they\u2019ve recognized that the impact of the act is likely to be complex. I think they\u2019re still trying to figure out what all of the different channels are by which it will effect the economy.\u201d How\u2019s Yellen doing so far? She\u2019s been methodical, responsive, elusive, exact, polite, imprecise. Asked what the Fed will do, she points backward to what the Fed has done and to its explanations of why. Not saying too much. Not saying too little. Textbook stuff so far. \u201cThe Fed has almost become a deficit-enabler, in that you\u2019re making it very easy to mask what the real cost of these deficits are,\u201d Neugebauer says. He is equating asset purchases, and associated low interest rates, with an effort to hide federal deficit spending. Yellen says the policy is motivated by unemployment and inflation benchmarks, \u201cvery important objectives that Congress has assigned to us,\u201d and not by an attempt to hide the debt. Neugebauer says Congress didn\u2019t pass a bill for quantitative easing. That was a Fed choice. \u201cThat very choice has really impacted the markets, and I believe is enabling these deficits to continue,\u201d he says. He\u2019s arguing that balancing the budget should be an overriding short-term economic goal. The argument, which is likely to outlive us all, has been made elsewhere, and rebutted, and made again, and rebutted. Five-minute recess. Rep. Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, asks whether the deficit hurts economic growth. Yellen says unsustainable long-term deficits have a negative effect of the economy. But it\u2019s a chicken-and-egg deal, because deficits are also a reflection of economic weakness, she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to take that as a yes,\u201d Neugebauer says. How many hours a week would you consider a part-time job? The president\u2019s defined it as 29 hours and above. Yellen says the Fed definition is under 35 hours. The president uses a Bureau of Labor Statistics definition, she says. An interesting moment because Yellen paused to confer with aides. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia has just praised Yellen for the clarity of her answers. Others watching are impressed with the questions. Is it a golden new sunrise for US economics talk? Rep Carolyn Maloney asks whether January\u2019s weak jobs report has caused the Fed to consider slowing the \u201ctaper\u201d \u2013 its plan to decrease asset purchases. \u201cI was surprised that the jobs reports and the January pace of job creation was running under what I had anticipated, but we have to be very careful about jumping to conclusions about what those reports mean,\u201d Yellen says. She says unseasonably cold temperatures may have played a role. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to take our time to assess just what our significance of this is,\u201d in the lead-up to the Fed meeting in March, she says. \u201cWhat would cause the committee to consider a pause is a notable change in the outlook,\u201d she says. Chairman Hensarling began the hearing by referring Yellen to the cameras all around her and warning that she was in the big time now. But if there\u2019s any secret to how these hearing things work, it does not seem hidden to her: Rep. Bill Huizenga, Republican of Michigan, asks whether the US shouldn\u2019t be concerned about hurting other economies by slowing its asset purchases program. If US bond rates lift, the thinking goes, investors may leave foreign shores for the lure of strengthening Treasury yields. Yellen acknowledges that Fed policy has foreign ramifications, but she does not leave much room for the impact on foreign economies to figure into this category of Fed decisions. \u201cWe have tried to be as clear as we possibly can\u201d in our asset purchases policy, Yellen says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear at the outset that as our recovery advanced... we would wind down our asset purchases.\u201d How are the markets reacting? Somewhere between \u201cmeh\u201d and \u201czzz\u201d, says Guardian US business correspondent Dominic Rushe (@dominicru). There\u2019s minimal movement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 83.00, or 0.53%. Rep. Waters comes out as \u201ca supporter of quantitative easing.\u201d She asks Yellen to summarize how the policy worked. Yellen says the Fed succeeded in pushing down longer-term interest rates by buying bonds and mortgage-backed securities. \u201cAs mortgage rates fell to historically low levels, we ... have seen a very meaningful increase in house prices, and I think that\u2019s improved the security of a very large number of households.\u201d She says low rates have also boosted spending in manufacturing sectors such as automobiles. And, the unemployment rate is down 1.5%. Hensarling asks a rather condescending question: \u201cAre you a sensible central banker, and if not, when will you become one?\u201d Yellen does not seem bothered: \u201cMr. congressman, I believe that I am one... The conditions facing the economy are extremely unusual.\u201d Hensarling has a first question. He uses a Wall Street Journal editorial to accuse the Fed of \u201cimprovisation\u201d. Yellen says when the federal funds rate functionally hit zero, the Fed needed to turn to novel tools, including forward guidance. Hensarling accuses the Fed of ignoring the federal funds rate threshold of zero by turning to other policies. He interrupts Yellen a couple times. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing the Fed says. There\u2019s other things the market may here,\u201d he says. Guardian US finance and economics editor Heidi Moore grabs the scene: Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe picks up on a tic in the statements so far by Republican members, who used air quotes to signal their skepticism of any so-called economic facts: If developments in the unemployment and inflation rates are satisfactory, the Fed will \u201clikely reduce\u201d asset purchases, although the purchases are \u201cnot on a preset course,\u201d Yellen says, as expected: If incoming information broadly supports the Committee\u2019s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. That said, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee\u2019s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. \u201cEconomic activity and employment will expand at a moderate rate in this year and the next\u201d and inflation will move back toward 2%,\u201d Yellen says. \u201cI expect a great deal of continuity in the [Fed\u2019s] approach to monetary policy,\u201d she says. The Fed\u2019s two-part goal, she says, will continue to be maximum employment and price stability. Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony is available on the committee web site. In her prepared remarks, Yellen confirms that the Fed is on track to reduce its policy stimulus, although the labor market recovery is \u201cfar from complete,\u201d Reuters reports: In her first public comments as Fed chief, Yellen said the central bank would need to keep its eye on a broad range of labor market indicators, not just the unemployment rate, as it continued to assess the health of the jobs market. Yellen, in testimony prepared for delivery to a congressional committee, nodded to the recent volatility in global financial markets, but said at this stage it does \u201cnot pose a substantial risk to the U.S. economic outlook.\u201d Hensarling says Yellen offered to stay all day. He says they can\u2019t because they have a bill on the floor this afternoon. So anyone that was hoping for nine hours of uninterrupted testimony from the Fed chair \u2013 :(. As usual, you may follow along with this morning\u2019s congressional hearing on C-SPAN \u2013 although be warned that they have completed an overhaul of their web site, and the main feature is a much-enlarged viewing window (if you\u2019re at your desktop). Which puts you truly face-to-face with the committee members. You can almost count the stars on their lapel pins. Committee chairman Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, has just completed his opening statement. He asked for renewed specificity from the Fed in its diagnoses and prognostications. Ranking Democarat Maxine Waters, from California, begins her statement. She praises Yellen, the first woman to serve as Fed chair, for her historic ascent. She says she wants to hear about the long-term employment outlook and wants the Fed to focus on unemployment in setting its assets purchases policy. Good morning and welcome to our live blog coverage of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s first outing on Capitol Hill in her new role. Yellen took over from Ben Bernanke on 3 February. She will be speaking this morning to members of the House financial services committee. As usual in these outings, the markets and interested others will be listening for any subtle signal in Yellen\u2019s testimony that the Fed\u2019s thinking on the health or direction of the economy is any different from what it is otherwise widely perceived to be. Yellen may talk about the slack jobs report of earlier this month, the lower (6.6%) unemployment rate, the purported underperformance of the stock market in 2014, the Fed\u2019s plan for its asset purchases program or any number of other topics. Given that this is a House committee, she may well end up talking about Benghazi. Forbes wonders whether Yellen has learned to \u201cdance on the head of a pin\u201d the way her predecessors did. They must not have watched her confirmation hearing.",

Analysts at Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> The BRC reported strong January retail sales growth of 5.4% with like for like increases of 3.9% (versus 2.8% and 1.2% respectively in 2013). We estimate a very contrasting like for like development in food (where we calculate declines of 1.9%) and in non-food. In the latter we calculate like for like growth of close to 10%. <br> Non-food housing related items seem to be booming, with the qualitative commentary suggesting double-digit like for like growth for large ticket items typically linked to lifting housing transactions (bedroom furniture, sofas, white goods, TVs etc). Clothing was also solid, but likely aided by a very soft comparable (with early sales hit in 2013 by the very cold weather). </blockquote> <p>So <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> added 15.3p to 485.6p, <strong>Kingfisher</strong> climbed 11.7p to 376.8p, <strong>Debenhams </strong>rose 3.8p to 77.70,<strong> Home Retail </strong>was 9.6p higher at 190.4p<strong> </strong>and <strong>Sports Direct International </strong>ended up 23p at 708p.<strong> JD Sports Fashion</strong> bucked the trend, down 63p at \u00a314.17.</p> <p>And supermarkets fell back after Kantar Worldpanel data showed poor sales performances from <strong>Tesco</strong>, down 5p at 318.7p, and <strong>Morrisons</strong>, 3.1p lower at 237.2p, and only marginal growth at <strong>J Sainsbury</strong>, down 7.3p at 348.9p. Morrisons and Tesco saw sales fall by 2.5% and 0.4% in the 12 weeks to 2 February, as discounters continued to gain market share.</p> <p>Overall, though, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> rose 81.11 points or 1.23% to 6672.66 as markets warmed to the first testimony from Janet Yellen as chair of the US Federal Reserve, in which she saw continued recovery in the US economy and said the trimming of the central bank's bond buying programme would continue depending on the economic data.

      "bodyText": "Retailers and mining shares were in the spotlight as leading shares moved sharply higher. High street businesses, particularly non-food retailers, benefited from a strong January performance as evidenced by the latest British Retail Consortium report. Analysts at Jefferies said: The BRC reported strong January retail sales growth of 5.4% with like for like increases of 3.9% (versus 2.8% and 1.2% respectively in 2013). We estimate a very contrasting like for like development in food (where we calculate declines of 1.9%) and in non-food. In the latter we calculate like for like growth of close to 10%. Non-food housing related items seem to be booming, with the qualitative commentary suggesting double-digit like for like growth for large ticket items typically linked to lifting housing transactions (bedroom furniture, sofas, white goods, TVs etc). Clothing was also solid, but likely aided by a very soft comparable (with early sales hit in 2013 by the very cold weather). So Marks &amp; Spencer added 15.3p to 485.6p, Kingfisher climbed 11.7p to 376.8p, Debenhams rose 3.8p to 77.70, Home Retail was 9.6p higher at 190.4p and Sports Direct International ended up 23p at 708p. JD Sports Fashion bucked the trend, down 63p at \u00a314.17. And supermarkets fell back after Kantar Worldpanel data showed poor sales performances from Tesco, down 5p at 318.7p, and Morrisons, 3.1p lower at 237.2p, and only marginal growth at J Sainsbury, down 7.3p at 348.9p. Morrisons and Tesco saw sales fall by 2.5% and 0.4% in the 12 weeks to 2 February, as discounters continued to gain market share. Overall, though, the FTSE 100 rose 81.11 points or 1.23% to 6672.66 as markets warmed to the first testimony from Janet Yellen as chair of the US Federal Reserve, in which she saw continued recovery in the US economy and said the trimming of the central bank's bond buying programme would continue depending on the economic data. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European markets have made broad based gains today after the latest testimony from new Fed chair Janet Yellen emphasised the importance of continuity in the implementation of US monetary policy. She emphasised that future tapering was very much data dependant and that emerging market volatility was not a concern given that these markets were perceived to be much better positioned to manage the current uncertainty than they were at the end of the 1990's.

In his initial reaction to Janet Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Janet Yellen\u2019s semi-annual monetary report to the Congress (her first official address as chair of the FOMC) was a relatively concise report. But it was also a fairly upbeat one. Despite some volatility in the data releases of late, Yellen seems to share our view that the US economy remains in acceleration mode \u2013 citing the pick-up in GDP growth rates during 2013 and also the improvements in the labour market \u2013 rather than focussing on recent payrolls disappointments.</p> <p>Still, it was not all good news, and Yellen noted her unhappiness with high rates of long term unemployment and labour force disaffection and drop out.</p> <p>It does look as if the old 6.5% unemployment rate forward guidance threshold is on its way out \u2013 which is only reasonable, given that the current unemployment rate is already 6.6%. Yellen talks instead about a \u201cbroad range of measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures, and inflation expectations\u201d. With this renewed emphasis on inflation (not currently a threat to policy rates) Yellen is perhaps trying to establish some early hawkish credentials \u2013 in contrast to her perception as a dove.</p> <p>But then Yellen was also clear that she represented \u201ccontinuity\u201d in terms of policy \u2013 given her key role in formulating Fed communications strategy and their so-called \u201coptimal monetary policy\u201d approach. As such, this sounds like she does not anticipate deviating from the $10bn taper per meeting that was announced in December, and repeated at the January FOMC meeting. A further $10bn taper in March seems probable, especially as Yellen did not think that the current volatility in Emerging Markets yet posed a substantial risk to the US economy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52fa275ee4b0b8d3ae1a9ca5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-11T13:37:26.096Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US Federal Reserve has released the <b>text of Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony</b> to lawmakers - due to be delivered at 3pm GMT.</p> <p>The full statement is available <a href=\"http://http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20140211a.htm\">here</a>, but I\u2019ve culled some of the most striking lines.</p> <blockquote> <p>The economic recovery gained greater traction in the second half of last year.</p> <p>The unemployment rate is still well above levels that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants estimate is consistent with maximum sustainable employment. Those out of a job for more than six months continue to make up an unusually large fraction of the unemployed, and the number of people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job remains very high. These observations underscore the importance of considering more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the U.S. labor market.</p> <p>I expect a great deal of continuity in the FOMC\u2019s approach to monetary policy. I served on the Committee as we formulated our current policy strategy and I strongly support that strategy, which is designed to fulfill the Federal Reserve\u2019s statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.</p> <p>The Committee has emphasized that a highly accommodative policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after asset purchases end. </p> <p>In the near term, we expect to finalize the rules implementing enhanced prudential standards mandated by section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

This could include the minutes of the MPC meeting giving more explicit guidance of where the committee members see interest rates going and perhaps a greater use of statements at the conclusion of the MPC meetings when the policy decision is announced. One possibility is that the Monetary Policy Committee minutes could adopt something similar to the \u201cdot chart\u201d published by the US Federal Reserve which is a matrix of the policymakers\u2019 views of where interest rates will be at the end of each of the next three years and over the longer term...</p> <p>It also looks likely that the Bank of England will focus much more on the general state of the economy and could well add wage growth to the indicators that it is specifically looking at.

      "bodyText": "Buoyant ahead of Janet Yellen\u2019s first testimony as chair of the US Federal Reserves, markets continued to gain ground during the course of her speech. Investors were buoyed by Yellen saying the Fed\u2019s bond buying programme would continue to be trimmed, depending on future economic data. She seemed in no hurry to disrupt the path the Fed was taking, while showing willingness to be adaptable as circumstances changed. All this pushed markets sharply higher on the day: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 81.11 points or 1.23% better at 6672.66, its high for the day \u2022 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.83% to 9460.14 \u2022 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.96% higher at 4278.00 \u2022 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 1.04% to 19,887.39 \u2022 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.09% higher at 10,091.2 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.86% or 136 points higher. And with that, I\u2019ll close this blog down for the evening. Thanks for the comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow when the Bank of England\u2019s forward guidance will be in the spotlight. Meanwhile, full coverage of Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony continues in our US live blog here. The Bank of England is looking at allegations its officials endorsed sharing of information between traders in the foreign exchange market, the central bank\u2019s deputy governor told MPs. My colleague Sean Farrell, who following the select committee, writes: The inquiry will examine claims that at a meeting between Bank officials and senior currency traders last April the officials said it was permissible for traders in different banks to share information about clients\u2019 positions ahead of the setting of a benchmark rate in the foreign exchange market. Andrew Bailey told the Treasury select committee: \u201cThe governors of the Bank have taken the claims about the meeting with the Bank\u2019s officials extremely seriously since we first heard about these allegations. Just so you know, we first heard about them in October. \u201cThe governors immediately initiated a full review into it led by the Bank of England\u2019s legal counsel but also supported by external legal counsel and also in close collaboration with the FCA (financial conduct authority). The full story is here: Bank of England launches inquiry into forex manipulation claims Yellen is answering questions now, and her testimony so far seems to be pleasing the markets. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 70 points or 0.45% while the FTSE 100 has added nearly 60 points or 0.9%. Capital Spreads said: A typically dovish stance from Janet Yellen\u2019s first testimony this afternoon has buoyed the markets just as a smidgeon of profit taking was starting to permeate risky assets. The short-term trend is certainly positive for the bulls who have not enjoyed a good start to the year, but as fears surrounding emerging markets and the recovery start to reduce, the appetite for risk will push markets higher. Yellen\u2019s view maintained that emerging markets posed less of a threat to the US economy than many had suggested, so all that investors now need is for the economic data to pick up and then the countdown to fresh all time highs can begin. Away from Janet Yellen and back to the Anglo Irish trial. Another of of the 16 people alleged to have been unlawfully given financial assistance by three ex directors of the Anglo Irish Bank has told a Dublin court that the now defunct institution told him Ireland\u2019s Financial Regulator had back their multi million euro loan scheme. Henry McDonald in Dublin writes: Property developer Joe O\u2019Reilly told the trial of the three bankers that he too had been assured that a leading law firm as well as the Financial Regulator had no problem with the loans aimed at buying shares in the bank. O\u2019Reilly said that one of the defendants in the case, Patrick Whelan flew down with Anglo Irish chief executive David Drumm (who is not on trial) to meet him on holiday in Faro, Portugal in July 2008. He told the court that Drumm informed him \u201cthat had had legal advice from MOP (law firm Matheson Ormsby Prentice), senior counsel, and Morgan Stanley and that the financial regulator was on board\u201d in relation to the deal. The Anglo Irish bosses were attempting to persuade O\u2019Reilly to take a multi-million euro loan in order to buy 10 million shares in the bank. The accused - Whelan, William McAteer and Sean Fitzpatrick - have all pleaded not guilty to the charges of unlawfully providing finance to 16 individuals. The case continues. Back in Washington, after a bit of adjusting of the microphone, Janet Yellen has begun her first testimony, and is presenting her prepared remarks released earlier. A reminder - our live blog is here and the live TV feed is here. Here\u2019s a mea culpa from the OECD regarding its errors in forecasting global economic growth. My colleague Angela Monaghan writes: A failure to spot the severity of the eurozone crisis and the impact of the meltdown of the global banking system led to consistent forecasting errors in recent years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development admitted on Tuesday. The Paris-based organisation said it repeatedly overestimated growth prospects for countries around the world between 2007 and 2012. The OECD revised down forecasts at the onset of the financial crisis, but by an insufficient degree, it said. \u201cForecasts were revised down consistently and very rapidly when the financial crisis erupted, but growth outturns nonetheless still proved substantially weaker than had been projected,\u201d it said in a paper exploring its forecasting record in recent years. The biggest forecasting errors were made when looking at the prospects for the next year, rather than the current year. The full story is here: OECD admits overstating growth forecasts amid eurozone crisis and global crash A live feed of Yellen\u2019s testimony is here. My colleague Tom McCarthy in the US will be live blogging Yellen\u2019s full testimony here: Janet Yellen testifies to Congress in first outing as Federal Reserve chief Kathleen Brooks at Forex.com said people should not expect any major changes from Yellen immediately: The only tweaks she may make are to forward guidance, she mentioned that the unemployment rate is not a complete indicator of labour market strength, thus the economic threshold could be changed or its scope widened to include a broader measure of the labour market that may not be as rosy as the unemployment rate suggests. However, it does not appear that a decision has been taken on this as yet. As we expected, Yellen firmly reiterated that rates will stay low for a long time, however the market has ignored this message and Treasury yields are above 2.7% on the back of her comments. Thus, Yellen and co. will have to work harder to get the message through about rates if they want to keep yields low in the coming months. Meanwhile Peter Spence of City AM has spotted what he thinks could be the Fed\u2019s new forward guidance: In her written testimony Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said that \u201cthe number of people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job remains very high.\u201d That\u2019s an almost explicit mention of \u201cU6\u201d - one of the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 measures of unemployment. The headline rate is \u201cU3\u201d. U6 captures all of that included in U3, along with \u201cdiscouraged workers\u201d (those who\u2019ve stopped looking for work), \u201cmarginally attached\u201d or \u201cloosely attached workers \u201c(who would like to work have not looked recently), and part-time workers who want to work full-time, but can\u2019t for economic reasons. While the Fed\u2019s U3 unemployment threshold is set at 6.5 per cent, that might be roughly equivalent to 11.5 per cent unemployment as measured by U6. Ahead of Yellen\u2019s appearance, hawkish Fed member Charles Plosser - a voting member this year but not last - has said assessing the US economy\u2019s performance has become more difficult given the recent low temperatures and heavy snowfall. In a speech at the University of Delaware he said: I suspect it may be another couple of months before we have a better read on the economy. He repeated his belief that the Fed should move more quickly to cut back its bond buying programme, calling it \u201cneither helpful nor essential.\u201d Even with the weak jobs reports in the past couple of months, he said there had been a significant improvement in labor market conditions, such that the criteria for ending the Fed\u2019s economic stimulus had been met. Yellen, of course, has just said crossing the 6.5% unemployment rate threshold would not automatically mean raising interest rates: [It] will instead indicate only that it had become appropriate for the committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook would justify such an increase. The dollar should be bolstered by Yellen\u2019s remarks, according to Gautam Batra, managing director and investment strategist at Signia Wealth: Janet Yellen re-affirmed that the Fed will continue to gradually reduce monetary stimulus. Her refusal to highlight recent weakness in economic data is a clear indication that the Fed has changed its view regarding the efficacy of further asset purchases. Fed policy is now subject to the whim of financial markets. Fixed income investors should be concerned and reduce duration in portfolios as interest rates rise from these unnaturally low levels. The US dollar should be bolstered by rising US yields. And behold: Another $10bn trimming of the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond buying programme could come in March, according to Rob Carnell at ING. In his initial reaction to Janet Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony, he said: Janet Yellen\u2019s semi-annual monetary report to the Congress (her first official address as chair of the FOMC) was a relatively concise report. But it was also a fairly upbeat one. Despite some volatility in the data releases of late, Yellen seems to share our view that the US economy remains in acceleration mode \u2013 citing the pick-up in GDP growth rates during 2013 and also the improvements in the labour market \u2013 rather than focussing on recent payrolls disappointments. Still, it was not all good news, and Yellen noted her unhappiness with high rates of long term unemployment and labour force disaffection and drop out. It does look as if the old 6.5% unemployment rate forward guidance threshold is on its way out \u2013 which is only reasonable, given that the current unemployment rate is already 6.6%. Yellen talks instead about a \u201cbroad range of measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures, and inflation expectations\u201d. With this renewed emphasis on inflation (not currently a threat to policy rates) Yellen is perhaps trying to establish some early hawkish credentials \u2013 in contrast to her perception as a dove. But then Yellen was also clear that she represented \u201ccontinuity\u201d in terms of policy \u2013 given her key role in formulating Fed communications strategy and their so-called \u201coptimal monetary policy\u201d approach. As such, this sounds like she does not anticipate deviating from the $10bn taper per meeting that was announced in December, and repeated at the January FOMC meeting. A further $10bn taper in March seems probable, especially as Yellen did not think that the current volatility in Emerging Markets yet posed a substantial risk to the US economy. The US Federal Reserve has released the text of Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to lawmakers - due to be delivered at 3pm GMT. The full statement is available here, but I\u2019ve culled some of the most striking lines. The economic recovery gained greater traction in the second half of last year. The unemployment rate is still well above levels that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants estimate is consistent with maximum sustainable employment. Those out of a job for more than six months continue to make up an unusually large fraction of the unemployed, and the number of people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job remains very high. These observations underscore the importance of considering more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the U.S. labor market. I expect a great deal of continuity in the FOMC\u2019s approach to monetary policy. I served on the Committee as we formulated our current policy strategy and I strongly support that strategy, which is designed to fulfill the Federal Reserve\u2019s statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability. The Committee has emphasized that a highly accommodative policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after asset purchases end. In the near term, we expect to finalize the rules implementing enhanced prudential standards mandated by section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We also are working to finalize the proposed rule strengthening the leverage ratio standards for U.S.-based, systemically important global banks. Since the financial crisis and the depths of the recession, substantial progress has been made in restoring the economy to health and in strengthening the financial system. Still, there is more to do. Too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective, and the work of making the financial system more robust has not yet been completed. And with that, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Breaking news: Federal Reserve chief Yellen says US jobs recovery far from complete Recent global markets volatility does not pose substantial risks to US economic outlook - Yellen Yellen expects \u201cgreat deal of continuity\u201d on US monetary policy Yellen says committed to helping economy return to full employment and ensuring inflation not persistently above or below 2% Straight from Dublin, the latest from the Anglo Irish trial of three former bank executives blamed for Ireland\u2019s banking crisis. In a complex and controversial case, a trio of disgraced bank executives at Anglo Irish Bank \u2013 Sean FitzPatrick, Pat Whelan and William McAteer \u2013 are facing charges of unlawfully providing financial assistance to individuals for the purpose of buying shares in Anglo Irish Bank in 2008. Henry McDonald in Dublin has the latest developments. The son of Ireland\u2019s one-time richest man has admitted in court that he had \u201cscant knowledge\u201d of the deal his father made to buy shares in the Anglo Irish Bank but accepted that his signatures were on the documents to seal the agreement. Sean Quinn junior told the trial of three Anglo Irish Bank executives in Dublin today that most of the signatures on the papers that secured the deal were his. His father was spending hundreds of millions of euros using party of the Quinn family business as surety on his loans from the now defunct bank back in 2007-2008. The Anglo Irish Bank trio - Sean Fitzpatrick, Patrick Whelan and William McAteer - have pleaded not guilty to unlawfully providing financial assistance to 16 individuals including Sean Quinn and a number of members of his family. Among the 16 are the so-called \u201cMaple 10\u201d group of investors who also borrowed hundreds of millions of euros worth from Anglo Irish to buy shares in the same bank. One of the \u201cMaple 10\u201d who gave evidence in court 19 of the Central Criminal Courts today was builder Sean Reilly. Reilly, a customer of the bank, claimed in court that he had been told on 8 July 2008 that a deal involving him borrowing \u20ac45 million to buy shares had been approved by both lawyers and Ireland\u2019s Financial Regulator. Background here. A potentially big step for Cyprus, as Turkish and Greek Cypriots agreed to work towards a new system of power sharing. Representatives of Greeks and Turks said they would seek to forge a two-zone federation reuniting the island, Reuters in Nicosia reports. The move has been welcomed by the chair of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, and UK foreign minister David Lidington. The political breakthrough coincides with a (relatively) upbeat assessment of the Mediterranean island\u2019s economy, from the country\u2019s international lenders - the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Following a visit to the island to review its bailout, the troika have concluded that Cyprus\u2019s economy is faring better than expected, although it warns that risks like ahead. Currency controls imposed last year to prevent a run on the banks will be \u201csignificantly relaxed\u201d from next week Cypriot finance minister Harris Georgiades has said. From the EC-ECB-IMF statement: Fiscal targets for 2013 have been met with considerable margin, due to both continued prudent budget execution and a less severe recession than anticipated. Output in 2013 is estimated to have contracted by about 6 percent in real terms, which, while significant, is almost two percentage points better than forecasted at the time of the last review. Private consumption contracted, although by less than expected, while tourism and professional services have proven resilient. The financial sector is also showing signs of stabilization. The economy is adjusting flexibly as prices and wages are declining, helping to cushion the full impact of the recession on jobs. Still, unemployment remains very high. The outlook remains challenging. Output is projected to contract by 4.8 percent in 2014, with domestic demand weighed down by the need for an adjustment of private and public sector debt from currently high levels. A return to positive but modest growth of around 1 percent is expected in 2015, led by non-financial services. Nonetheless, risks to the outlook are substantial. A few highlights from Andrew Bailey\u2019s meeting with MPs over the debacle at the Co-op (see also 10.41) Reading between the tweets, this defence didn\u2019t go down too well with Labour\u2019s John Mann. Like the proverbial London buses, soothing messages about the eurozone come in pairs. Erkki Liikanen, a European Central Bank governing council member, has just told members of the House of Lords there is no risk of deflation in the eurozone. Deflation means normally a broad-based fall of prices over a prolonged period and on a broad front, and we don\u2019t have signs of deflation in the euro area. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, recently reappointed as Germany\u2019s finance minister, came up with a remarkably similar formula in an interview with Reuters published on Tuesday. There is no deflation danger in Europe. We understand deflation as a reluctance to spend in the anticipation of falling prices. And there are no signs of this. Sch\u00e4uble also said Europe would stand behind emerging markets - \u201cwithin the limits of our possibilities\u201d - after months of currency volatility that has battered their economies. The difficult situation in some emerging markets affects us of course. We are all dependent on exports, Germany more than other countries. Ahead of Janet Yellen\u2019s first outing as Fed chair on Capitol Hill in a few hours, here is a short reading list. Here\u2019s What\u2019s Expected From Janet Yellen\u2019s First-Ever Remarks As Chair Of The Federal Reserve Today The Business Insider is not expecting big economic policy drama, rather a moment for the formidable economist to introduce herself as head of the Fed. A question for Yellen Writing in the New York Times, the former chief economist to vice president Joe Biden wants to know what data the Fed would need to suspend its financial stimulus. Janet Yellen: tough in her views and tough in her independence The Guardian\u2019s profile depicts a formidable academic economist, who is unafraid to speak her mind. Is Janet Yellen the wrong choice for the Fed? Although the headline promises more than it delivers, James Kwak at Harvard Law School provides an interesting read in Prospect on how the Fed chairmanship has changed since the heyday of Alan \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d Greenspan. A few snippets from Mario Monti, Italy\u2019s former prime minister and European commissioner, on the UK and the its place in the European Union. Some punchy reaction to Barclays\u2019 decision to pay its bankers bonuses that are (on average) 10% higher than last year, while profits have dropped sharply. It cannot be right in any business for the executive bonus pool to be nearly three times bigger than the total dividend pay out to the company\u2019s owners. In 2013, the bank paid out \u00a3859 million in dividends compared to a staff bonus pool of \u00a32.38 billion. The question must be asked \u2013 for whom is this institution being run? The TUC? A Blue Labour think tank? Nope. These are actually the words of the Institute of Directors\u2019s Roger Barker, director of corporate governance. Here\u2019s more: Efforts to pay high bonuses based on exploitation of loopholes in the EU bonus rules also send a bad signal. Barclays needs to recognise that it starts in an extremely difficult place in the eyes of the public, given its ongoing stream of regulatory problems and infringements, including the recent loss of customer data, the LIBOR scandal and the mis-selling of PPI. This is not a matter for government. It is a matter for shareholders \u2013 and particularly large investment fund managers who have a duty to the ordinary workers whose pensions they are investing. Their approach to the banks continues to be supine. We would like to see shareholders take a more aggressive role in the governance of the bank, and in light of Barclays\u2019 fragile reputational recovery we would urge the bank to ensure that the Chairman of its Remuneration Committee remains an independent director. The central bank on everyone\u2019s mind today is the US Federal Reserve, but it\u2019s worth remembering that the Bank of England will issue its monthly inflation report tomorrow. As Howard Archer of IHS points out in a note, this will be of particular interest as the bank is likely to announce adjustments to its forward guidance policy - a pledge to freeze interest rates until unemployment falls below 7%, which has quickly become outdated as the economy recovers. Archer expects that the bank will try to dampen expectations of a rate rise, as well as adding to its list of economic indicators. While the Bank of England has always stressed that a 7% unemployment rate is not a trigger for an automatic interest rate rise, the fact that unemployment has come down so rapidly means that it needs to adjust its forward guidance policy to dilute increased expectations that interest rates could rise before long... While it remains to be seen exactly how the Bank of England will update its forward guidance policy, it seems likely that strong communication will be a major part of the bank\u2019s efforts to limit interest rate hike expectations. This could include the minutes of the MPC meeting giving more explicit guidance of where the committee members see interest rates going and perhaps a greater use of statements at the conclusion of the MPC meetings when the policy decision is announced. One possibility is that the Monetary Policy Committee minutes could adopt something similar to the \u201cdot chart\u201d published by the US Federal Reserve which is a matrix of the policymakers\u2019 views of where interest rates will be at the end of each of the next three years and over the longer term... It also looks likely that the Bank of England will focus much more on the general state of the economy and could well add wage growth to the indicators that it is specifically looking at. Wage growth can provide a key insight as to whether labour market tightness is starting to lead to a build-up in inflationary pressures. But don\u2019t expect any change to the headline policy, Archer says. It looks unlikely that the Bank of England will adjust its forward guidance policy by lowering the unemployment rate threshold for considering an interest rate cut from 7.0% to 6.5% or lower. Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is giving evidence to MPs on the Co-op disastrous attempt to take over Lloyds Bank branches - codenamed Project Verde. He has also been on the defensive about the bank\u2019s knowledge of foreign-exchange manipulation. Bailey told the committee there was no evidence anyone at the bank had condoned foreign exchange cheating. The Bank of England does not condone any form of market manipulation in any context whatsoever.\ufeff There is lots more in the mix. My colleague Sean Farrell is watching: In today\u2019s paper, we report that UK families will have to wait until next year for their disposable incomes to start rising again. The analysis comes from a Resolution Foundation review of household incomes that contradicts recent Treasury studies. Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent, has been looking into the findings on Northern Ireland, where living standards have fallen faster than anywhere else in the UK. Northern Ireland was hit hardest by the recession with its average income falling double that of the UK average. A British region-by-region comparison of living standards has found that living standards declined further in Northern Ireland than anywhere else in the UK. A survey by the Resolution Foundation uses a measurement known as GVA. It calculates income generated by businesses, minus the cost of goods and services used to create the income, and then divides that sum by the population. It found that 2008 and 2013 GVA per head in Northern Ireland fell by 10% from \u00a317,910 to \u00a316,130. The UK average between these years of contraction was 5.8%. Other figures recently released show that Northern Ireland sustained a 10% decrease in overall economic output from a peak in 2007 - the year before the global wide crash. The full report from the Resolution Foundation is available here. A few interesting visitors are turning up at the Palace of Westminster this morning. In the Lords, Mario Monti, former prime minister of Italy, will be giving evidence on the eurozone crisis via video link. He will be joined by Erkki Liikanen, governor of the Bank of Finland, as well as chair of the high level expert group on reforming the structure of the EU Banking Sector. Over at the Commons, Andrew Bailey, deputy governor for prudential regulation at the Bank of England, will be giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee. Transmission will be here from 10am. My colleague Sean Farrell is at the Commons. I will keep track of Monti/Liikanen, which is due to start now. No sign the transmission is up and running yet, but check back later at this link. There were plenty of daredevil moves when the Singapore air show kicked off earlier today. Aside from the loop-the-loops, Asia\u2019s largest aerospace gathering is the place where some of the world\u2019s biggest long-haul carriers and travel tycoons will meet, along with the region\u2019s busy military buyers - with the important exception of Indonesia, which is boycotting the event. However aviation experts are not expecting Singapore to notch up the record $200 bn of deals made last year at the Dubai air show. The Wall Street Journal has this handy guide to the air show, which finishes on Sunday. The biggest air show in the Asia-Pacific region kicks off this week in Singapore with organisers hopeful that deals close to $25 billion may be signed. The Singapore air show may come nowhere close to Dubai three months ago, where $150 billion of deals were signed on the first day itself. Still, it is attracting the brass of both Airbus Group NV and its archival Boeing Co. because the event offers opportunities to meet the rapidly expanding airlines in Asia. ... \u201cGenerally fewer orders may be ready to be announced but Singapore is still important as Asia has emerged as a growth region with a lot of potential,\u201d said Brendan Sobie, an analyst with aviation consulting firm CAPA\u2014Centre for Aviation. However, Mr. Sobie said the timing of the air show may work against it as it is the first such big event in the calendar after the previous year\u2019s rush to complete orders. There is also much fanfare about Airbus\u2019s latest plane the A350 - the rival to Boeing 787 Dreamliner - which has gone on display for the first time. Update 13.15: Interesting comments on the A350 below the line from BigBlue80 and ProEurope. A quick look at the markets shows Europe\u2019s main indices are making gains, ahead of Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony later today. FTSE100 +0.8% at 6644 points Barclays shares are down 1.2%, although they are not the biggest faller on the UK \u2018s bluechip stock exchange this morning. Germany\u2019s DAX +0.78% at 9362 points France\u2019s CAC40 +0.51% at 4258 points Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB +0.69% at 19,823 points Speaking of banking standards... Richard Lambert, the former head of the CBI employers\u2019 association, has been out and about this morning, talking about his proposals to clean up the banking sector. Here is a flavour from the Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor: Speaking [on Monday] as he launched a consultation paper with 19 questions for the industry, he said: \u201cOver time, the ambition would be to encourage the development of banking as a profession, along the lines of accountancy or the law.\u201d But Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, immediately warned it could take a generation for the banking standards body to win any credibility with the public and the industry. Lambert \u2013 who refused to commit himself to staying on to head the organisation \u2013 immediately provoked controversy with his proposal that the head of the standards body be called before the Treasury select committee to give evidence each year. Lambert said this idea was based on the way the General Medical Council appeared before the health select committee. Tyrie, who also chaired the parliamentary commission on banking standards, which reported last year, said: \u201cThere is no parallel with the GMC. The banking commission specifically rejected statutory powers for a professional banking body.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a welcome start to a very long-term project. As the banking commission concluded, it could take at least a generation to create a credible, effective body,\u201d Tyrie said. Lambert said that the way bankers pay themselves \u201cshapes behaviour\u201d, but the focus should be on the performance criteria behind bonus payments rather than their size. \u201cThis body can\u2019t deal with quantum but it should be interested in construct.\u201d The full consultation paper is here. Bad news from the Barclays conference call with journalists: Barclays CEO says to cut up to 12,000 jobs this year Barclays CEO says expects 7,000 jobs to go in the UK this year, about half have been notified Via Reuters From the UK, we have another masterclass in how banks work. Barclays has reported a 32% fall in profits, but has increased its bonus payouts by 10%. The total bonus pool for 2013 rose by 10% to \u00a32.38bn, up from \u00a32.17bn in 2012. Barclays are using that well worn argument, \u2018it\u2019s a competitive old world\u2019, to justify the payout. At Barclays we believe in paying for performance and paying competitively. Ensuring that we have the right people in the right roles serving our customers and clients effectively in a highly competitive global environment is vital to our ability to generate sustainable shareholder returns. After careful consideration, we determined that an increase of \u00a3210m over the prior year in the incentive pool was required in 2013 in order to build our franchise in the long term interests of shareholders. Notwithstanding this increase we remain committed to our goal of reducing the compensation to net income ratio over the medium term to the mid 30s. Unsurprisingly this claim has raised a few eyebrows... Read the full results here and the Guardian city editor Jill Treanor\u2019s report here. Antony Jenkins, Barclays chief executive, who has waived his bonus, told the Today programme the bank was making progress to become more attractive to customers, but more had to be done. We do have a long way to go and I acknowledge that. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Janet Yellen is the big economic news today, as she heads to Capitol Hill to give her first testimony to US lawmakers as head of the Federal Reserve. Asian markets were up today, as investors wait for Yellen to speak on the economy and US monetary policy. Yellen, a superstar economist who predicted the US housing bubble, is the first woman to chair the Fed in its 100-year history. As a vice chair of the Fed under predecessor Ben Bernanke, and an architect of the Fed\u2019s generous economic stimulus, market watchers are expecting little change. Gary Dugan, chief investment officer in Asia and the Middle East for Coutts &amp; Co: With U.S. employment data materially deteriorating, there is a building argument that the Fed should ease off tightening monetary conditions. We suspect that Yellen would not want to significantly change policy at her first meeting in March. Via Bloomberg Michael Hewson at CMC Markets says investors will also be looking at how Yellen deals with the politics of the day, as she enters the \u201clions den\u201d of Congress. Markets will also be looking at how Janet Yellen deals with the some of the more disparate political elements within that chamber, given that the debt ceiling has still to be raised and that the deadline for that has now passed, and the US treasury is implementing special measures, to extend that deadline. The hearing before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee starts at 10am (1500 GMT). Here in the UK, another fine lesson on how the City works: Barclays has reported that its total bonus pool was increased by 10% to \u00a32.38bn in 2013, while profits were down 32% I\u2019ll be following that and all the latest developments...",

      "bodyText": "A failure to spot the severity of the eurozone crisis and the impact of the meltdown of the global banking system led to consistent forecasting errors in recent years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development admitted on Tuesday. The Paris-based organisation said it repeatedly overestimated growth prospects for countries around the world between 2007 and 2012. The OECD revised down forecasts at the onset of the financial crisis, but by an insufficient degree, it said. \"Forecasts were revised down consistently and very rapidly when the financial crisis erupted, but growth out-turns nonetheless still proved substantially weaker than had been projected,\" it said in a paper exploring its forecasting record in recent years. The biggest forecasting errors were made when looking at the prospects for the next year, rather than the current year. The OECD said a failure to predict the path and the impact of the eurozone crisis, and a failure to understand the banking crisis and how interdependent the global financial system had become, were to blame for the errors. \"Challenges were compounded by the unusually high speed and depth of cross-country interconnections between real and financial developments, the increased variability of economic growth compared with the pre-crisis period, the lack of timely data on many important financial factors, and the limited understanding of macro-financial linkages,\" it said. The OECD said a failure to understand the impact of austerity policies in various countries did not appear to be a major driver of forecasting inaccuracies. It said the OECD became better at factoring in the impact of austerity amid little space for further monetary loosening as the crisis continued. Overall, \"fiscal consolidation is not significantly negatively related to the forecast errors\". Changes that have since been introduced to address some of the issues include a closer monitoring of short-term developments, for example by taking more notice of early signals from surveys and other anecdotal evidence. Work has also begun on improving economic models to better reflect the impact of banking sector behaviour. \"The macroeconomic models available at the time of the crisis typically ignored the banking system and failed to allow for the possibility that bank capital shortages and credit rationing might impact on macroeconomic developments,\" it said.",

      "bodyText": "\"At Barclays we believe in paying for performance and paying competitively,\" declared Antony Jenkins, chief executive, several times on Tuesday. It is certainly true that the bank is committed to paying competitively. From \"Singapore to San Francisco\", as Jenkins put it, Barclays wants to go head-to-head with JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs to hire and retain the investment bankers it values most highly. But pay for performance? Nonsense. Pre-tax profits in the investment bank fell 37% last year to \u00a32.52bn and return on equity plunged from 12.7% to 8.2%. A performance of that sort demands a cut in bonuses, not a 13% increase. Jenkins and Barclays have breached two understandings with shareholders. The first is the general principle that the bonuses are meant to adapt to the financial weather. Banks themselves prefer the term \"variable compensation\" \u2013 awards are meant to go up in sunny years and down in a downpour. But Jenkins is now citing a sub-clause in this unwritten contract. \"After careful consideration, we determined that an increase of \u00a3210m over the prior year in the incentive pool was required in 2013 in order to build our franchise in the long-term interests of shareholders.\" In other words, Barclays feels long-term franchise-building, however vaguely expressed, trumps the need to tie annual rewards to annual performance. This is not \"pay for performance\" as the outside world understands the term. It is more like \"pay for performance that we hope will occur one day provided JP Morgan et al don't ramp up bonuses even higher and if trading bonds becomes interesting again\". The second breach of understanding with shareholders is specific. A year ago Barclays declared that a \"turning point\" had been reached on pay and that shareholders would get a fairer cut in future. Here's Sir John Sunderland in last year's annual report: \"For 2012 and in future we are taking a different approach to the balance between directors' and employees' remuneration, and returns for shareholders.\" That statement still holds, Barclays tried to suggest on Tuesday: medium-term targets for compensation-to-income ratios have not been altered. Really? Sceptical shareholders will feel that \"medium term\" is a flexible term at Barclays; the phrase seems to mean whatever management wishes it to mean. Jenkins, to give him some credit, is getting a few things right at Barclays. But his line on bonuses is absurd. What he has revealed is that when \"pay for performance\" and \"competitive pay\" come into conflict, Barclays will choose the latter. Jenkins' soundbites may be more customer-friendly than his predecessors', but his protection of the bonuses of senior staff at the expense of shareholders' rewards is straight out of the John Varley/Bob Diamond era. Barclays is still being run for its staff, not its owners.",

The secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Dave Smith, said Toyota\u2019s decision was a long-awaited death blow. \u201cWhen General Motors announced it was closing here, it was all over,\u201d he says. \u201cThe management spoke to workers yesterday and were honest about the situation, they were applauded on a number of occasions. \u201cPeople I\u2019ve spoken to are relieved, in a way. At least they have certainty now, they don\u2019t have to worry about having a job in 2017. But when the reality sinks in about not having a job after then, they\u2019ll be very worried.\u201d Smith believes the idea that 50,000 people would easily find jobs is \u201cutter bullshit\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll take years and years to get over this.\u201d Altona is a very straightforward bayside suburb, nestled beside the West Gate bridge, which links Melbourne to Victoria\u2019s west. Unusually for Melbourne\u2019s western fringe it has a beach, which hosts dog walkers and joggers as the politicians head back to the CBD. Breakfasters in the pleasant Cr\u00e8me caf\u00e9 could not escape the reality of what had just happened on their doorstep, with numerous copies of the Herald Sun \u2013 headline: \u201cCarmageddon\u201d \u2013 scattered about the tables. One diner, who only reluctantly give his name as Max, looked particularly downbeat. After some gentle prodding it was clear why \u2013 he works for a company that supplies parts to Toyota. What\u2019s the mood like at work? \u201cAh, terrible,\u201d Max said. \u201cWhat do you do now? It\u2019s all gone.\u201d A woman waiting in the queue interrupted with her own view: \u201cEverything is too expensive in this country.\u201d She gestured to a menu showing all the things you can get with your scrambled eggs. \u201cEverything.\u201d Altona may be becoming desirable for Melbourne house buyers looking for a speedy route to the city \u2013 Julia Gillard recently made a tidy profit when she sold the Altona house where she lived throughout her prime ministership \u2013 but it is not without its challenges. Incomes are below the national average. More than half of the people in the region were either born overseas or are second-generation migrants. The manufacturing downturn has been felt by the light industry that dots the shoreline. \u201cThe Toyota closure will have a dramatic effect,\u201d Tim Watts, the area\u2019s federal Labor MP, told Guardian Australia. \u201cMelbourne\u2019s west is a very diverse area, there are emerging creative industries, but there are plenty of people who have been working for decades in manufacturing. \u201cIt will have a big social impact. Tony Abbott seems to have a vision where manufacturing ends in Australia and is replaced by work-for-the-dole schemes. So we\u2019ll have an empty Altona factory and people picking up litter in the park opposite it. \u201cYou\u2019d think we\u2019d be investing in our schools to give people the skills to deal with this, but the Gonski loadings that would go to kids whose parents are from overseas or are from low-income families are gone. I\u2019m very worried for my electorate today.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The debate over how long it will take before disposable incomes start rising again has been stoked further after a respected thinktank argued that the average family will be forced to wait until next year. The Resolution Foundation said an in-depth review of household incomes found they will begin to rise above inflation in 2015 \u2013 after a five-year wait. However, the living standard of the average household in 2018 will still be 3.5% lower than in 2008, the thinktank added. The Resolution Foundation said a detailed assessment of living standards in Britain found that an increase in disposable incomes next year will be \"barely positive\" and will be no more than 1% a year for each of the following three years. The report contradicted a Treasury study that said disposable incomes started improving in 2012/13. \"The living standards of the typical household will still be 3.5% lower in 2018-19 than they were at the start of the financial crisis of 2008, only just inching above the level they were last at in 2005-06,\" said the thinktank. The report, The State of Living Standards, paints a contrasting picture of family incomes to the one put forward by George Osborne last month. Citing research by the Treasury, the chancellor said that tax relief from a higher personal allowance had pushed up disposable incomes in the 2012/13 financial year, offsetting depressed wages and rising prices, especially gas and electricity hikes. Treasury officials came under fire for excluding cuts in tax credits and benefits from their sums and ignoring a trend since last spring of falling wages.Gavin Kelly, the thinktank's chief executive, said: \"Our evidence suggests that the fall in living standards is bottoming out and should start to rise again next year. That's the good news and given year after year of decline it will come as a relief. But as things stand the recovery for families looks like being painfully slow \u2013 by 2018 we expect the typical household to still be worse off than they were before the crisis.\" Meanwhile, a report by the business lobby group the CBI said that business were already investing to take advantage of the upturn in the UK's fortunes. In its quarterly report on the state of the world economy, it found that British businesses had commissioned new IT systems, machinery and raised their marketing budgets to take advantage of GDP growth that ranks alongside the US as the best among western economies. Growth this year will reach 2.6%, up from the previous forecast of 2.4% boosted by a turnaround in business investment from -3.7% last year to 6.6% this year. However, the political uncertainty created by the Scottish referendum, a hard-fought general election in 2015 and the possibility of an in-out EU referendum could persuade businesses to delay investment plans, it said. The CBI's policy director, Katja Hall, said: \"Political risks are at the top of the agenda for lots of businesses and especially those based outside the UK that are considering large investments.\" Over the last year the economy has relied on consumers to maintain the recovery and January was no different, according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Discounts on furniture and household goods pushed retail sales 5.4% higher last month, compared with January 2013. But the BRC warned that the figures were distorted by a sharp fall in sales last January and pointed to the more modest 1.7% quarterly comparison.",
