      "bodyText": "The Abbott government has backed away from plans to remove the 49% foreign ownership cap on Qantas after accepting the move would not survive the Senate. The government instead adopted Labor\u2019s call for a minimalist proposal to remove two other existing limits on Qantas: the 35% cap on the level of ownership by a single foreign airline and the 25% cap on a single foreign owner. In March the government paved the way for a political standoff over the future of the national carrier by deciding to remove part three of the Qantas Sale Act, which included the ownership caps. Part three also required two-thirds of Qantas directors to be Australian citizens and maintenance and catering for international flights to be primarily done in Australia. The scale of the change was opposed by Labor, Greens and the Palmer United party (PUP), which had the power to vote down the bill. The treasurer, Joe Hockey, confirmed on Wednesday the government would water down its planned changes after accepting they would not secure adequate upper house support. \u201cI think it is important that we try to get Qantas onto the same playing field as its competitors,\u201d Hockey told the ABC. \u201cAgain, the Senate chose not to back our legislation in this case but an alternative was proposed by the Labor party and we\u2019re prepared to accept that to give some stability to the rules governing the ownership of Qantas.\u201d The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said Qantas should remain majority Australian-owned and he was pleased with the government\u2019s concession. \u201cThe Abbott government voted to send thousands of Australian jobs overseas in the House of Representatives and this is an admission that they got this wrong,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cLabor will always fight to keep Qantas jobs in Australia and stop them from going overseas.\u201d Shorten said the \"sensible measures\" agreed between the government and Labor would allow Qantas to raise \"quite a degree of foreign equity while still keeping Aussie jobs here\". A Qantas spokeswoman welcomed the deal but said the company would like the parliament to go further in removing restrictions, including the overall 49% foreign ownership limit. \"It's positive that there\u2019s general agreement that Qantas is disadvantaged by the Sale Act and that change is needed,\" she said.\"While removing all restrictions that apply only to Qantas remains our preference for levelling the playing field, changing the 25% and 35% limits would represent an improvement on the status quo.\" The lower house passed the government\u2019s original bill in March, after a parliamentary debate that included opposition warnings of a break-up of the national carrier and ministers arguing against governing \u201cby nostalgia and sentiment\u201d. The government wants to pass changes to the Qantas Sale Act this week before parliament rises for the winter break. The deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, said the government still believed the best way to assist Qantas in its present financial difficulties was to ensure the airline was subject to the same investment and operational rules as its competitors including Virgin. The amended bill would \"go some way to easing restrictive ownership provisions\" but was the only outcome that the Senate would pass \"at this time\", Truss said.",

      "bodyText": "In any other market apart from tobacco, US regulators surely would not tolerate what's being contemplated as Reynolds, owner of the Camel brand, plans to buy Lorillard for $27.4bn. The new combo, even after coughing up a few brands to the UK's Imperial Tobacco, will control about 35% of the US market. Meanwhile, Altria, , has about half. That's a duopoly isn't it? The rules, apparently, are different in the gasper business, assuming Reynolds and Lorillard are correct in thinking they are shedding enough assets to satisfy local competition authorities. Their argument, one assumes, is that an industry in decline needs to make cost savings and, anyway, Altria will still be number one. Well, yes, but the two titans may also have an awful lot of power to lift prices over time. US convenience stores \u2013 the \"mom and pop\" operators \u2013 may not be celebrating as merrily as shareholders in Reynolds and Lorillard have been since this deal came into view several months ago. What about Imperial? With an improved market share in the US of 10%, up from 3% today, will it be able to scamper profitably between the legs of the giants? Worryingly, chief executive Alison Cooper called her $7.1bn deal to buy four cigarette brands plus Blu, Lorillard's e-cigarette brand, \"transformational\". Too often, use of that dreaded phrase implies a strategic U-turn or a financial gamble. Imperial is not guilty on the first charge. Cooper has been championing the virtues of the US as a \"growth\" area for ages. Her counter-intuitive argument is that the US tobacco market is now declining only slowly; the product litigation risk these days is low because the Food &amp; Drug Administration is a predictable regulator; and the market itself is also, obviously, very big. Nor, on the face of it, is Imperial overpaying. After a tax benefit, it is forking out just seven times the assets' top-line earnings. On the other hand, the four brands of fags being acquired \u2013 Winston, Kool, Salem and Maverick \u2013 all look to be wheezy also-rans. The best part of the purchase may turn out to be Blu, where the prospect of international growth is easy to understand. What about Imperial's financing? Adventurous, to put it mildly. Tobacco companies' balance sheets can withstand a lot of strain, but Imperial is pushing the limits by paying solely with new borrowing. Net debt will rise to about \u00a313bn, or roughly 3.5 times Imperial's top-line earnings \u2013 that's punchy. Naturally, the main credit agencies immediately put up \"negative outlook\" notices while they crunch the numbers on the deal. Don't worry, our investment-grade rating will survive, argued Imperial. If that assessment is correct, shareholders will probably be supportive. Their main concern is the dividend, which has been rising at an annual rate of 10% in recent years. If Cooper can demonstrate that record is not in peril, investors will be relaxed. All the same, Imperial will now be trying to earn a quarter of its profits from a country where it is up against a powerful and entrenched duopoly. Call it transformational if you must, but it also looks risky.",

The IoD's focus is on the promotion of Robert rather than on pay, although Experian's annual report shows that long-term incentive plans and annual pay deals have handed him \u00a345m in the past five years. The investor group the Investment Management Association has warned its members about the succession planning. The IoD's corporate governance adviser, Oliver Parry, said: \"Shareholders have understandably raised significant concerns about the decision of the board of Experian to appoint Mr Robert as their next chairman. \"Experian have contravened a key provision of the corporate governance code that a CEO should not go on to be chairman except in the most exceptional circumstances. \"The chairman's role is to lead the board in the oversight of the executive team, but without interfering in operational management.

In full-page adverts taken out in the wake of the scandal, in which horsemeat was found in burgers sold in Tesco and other retailers, the supermarket stated: \"We know that the more we work with British farmers the better.\" Raymond said: \"Consumers want to buy our great British product and know when it is in peak season, so it is vitally important at this time of year to give clearly-labelled, home-grown lamb pride of place, when there is a good, affordable and fresh supply on our doorstep.\" He said that the UK had more than enough lamb to be self-sufficient and that grass-fed spring-born British lamb was now in peak season, while meat from the southern hemsiphere was at the end of its season. Tesco said it sold more British lamb than any other retailer and expected to sell more than ever before this season ends. \"We are delivering on our commitment to strengthen our relationships with British sheep farmers through our Tesco Sustainable Lamb Group, which currently supports around 200 farmers,\" a Tesco spokesperson said. The latest clash comes after Tesco was criticised by farmers for cutting the amount of British beef it bought. A report by the National Farmers' Union published in February found that while the supermarket had achieved its promise of sourcing all fresh chicken in the UK, it had not set a timetable for its aim of putting British chicken in all its ready meals and had not even set an \"aspiration\" to source 100% British lamb in season. Tesco said at the time that it did not recognise the 8% fall in its purchase of British beef highlighted by the NFU and that all its beef was sourced in either the UK or Ireland, which customers did not differentiate between. Since then the price of British beef has dived as shoppers continue to shy away from buying processed foods with beef at a time of relatively high stocks.",

We have put in place numerous steps and have more in the works that will strengthen these institutions, force them to hold a great deal of additional capital and reduce odds of failure.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>YELLEN ON OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF SYSTEMIC RISK</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Systemic risk in the financial system is not purely a question of too-big-to-fail institutions... We could have systemic risk if a large number of smaller institutions are hit for some reason.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>YELLEN ON HEADWINDS AND FISCAL POLICY</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"I do agree with the view that there are substantial headwinds facing the economy. One example would be that we see in surveys of households that their expectations about their future finances and growth in their real incomes is exceptionally depressed and I think that's a factor that is depressing spending. We see in the housing market were we had some progress but it now looks like it's stalled... And fiscal policy has been a factor in my view holding back recovery and that's what monetary policy has had to counteract and that's in part why we've needed such an accommodative monetary policy\u2026 The economy is making progress\u2026 But to the extent that even when the economy gets back on track it doesn't mean that these headwinds will have completely disappeared\u2026\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53c54c5be4b0a8563a66ce9c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-07-15T16:05:59.896Z\">5.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Janet Yellen's Q&amp;A, the key points</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d0f42d72-5d08-44b1-bf57-dac883e17b10\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/15/1405439766400/d8b624ac-e48b-4595-a555-72ae567d3dd6-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, July 15, 2014, before  the Senate Banking Committee.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testifying before  the Senate Banking Committee today.

Of course we need to be cautious to make sure the economy continues to recover.\"\"This is not a pre-set course. If we were to judge the conditions changed significantly, it's not locked in stone.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>YELLEN ON WAGE INFLATION</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"While rising compensation or wage growth is one sign that the labor market is healing, we are not even at the point where wages are rising at a pace that they could give rise to inflation. In fact real wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity growth; what we\u2019ve seen is a shift in the distribution of national income away from labor and toward capital.\"There is some room there for faster growth in wages and for real wage gains before we need to worry that's creating an overall inflationary pressure for the economy. That's something we are watching closely.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>YELLEN ON USING REPURCHASE OPERATIONS TO HELP CONTROL FUNDS RATE\"</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We've indicated that the main tool we will use is the interest rate we pay on overnight reserves. The overnight RP facility that you refer to I think of as a back-up tool that we will use to help us to control the federal funds rate, to improve our control over the federal funds rate. I think it's a very effective and useful tool. We have gleaned that from the initial testing that we've done. But as you mentioned, we do have concerns about allowing that facility to become too large or to play too prominent a role\u2026\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>YELLEN ON WHETHER CONGRESS SHOULD REQUIRE A FED BOARD SEAT BE FILLED BY A COMMUNITY BANKER</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"I am very positive on the idea of having a community banker appointed to the board. That said, I don't support requiring it by legislation... That's a road that could go further in a direction that would worry me. If we're earmarking, we could end up earmarking each seat for particular kinds of expertise.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>YELLEN ON LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"While long-term unemployment remains at exceptionally high levels and is a grave concern, I do think we are seeing improvements as the job market is strengthening.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>YELLEN ON TIMING OF RATE RISE</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Federal Open Market Committee will be looking at \"maximum employment and price stability... There's no formula and no mechanical answer that I can give you about when the first rate hike will occur. It will depend on the progress of the economy and how we assess it based on a variety of indicators.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>YELLEN ON ECONOMY, RATE HIKE OUTLOOK</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"My reading at the present time is that the (Q1) GDP decline is largely due to factors I would judge to be transitory, and I do think that negative number substantially understates the momentum in the economy. Of course this is something we need to watch carefully and are doing so....\"The Federal Reserve does need to be quite cautious with respect to monetary policy. We have in the past seen sort of false dawns, periods in which we thought growth would speed, pick up and the labor market would improve more quickly, and later events would prove those hopes to be unfortunately over-optimistic.</p> <p>\"We are watching very carefully. Especially when short-term overnight rates are at zero so we have no ability to lower them further, we need to be careful to make sure the economy is on a solid trajectory before we consider raising interest rates.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-77aa8bf7-35e5-42e2-aedd-f9002688ee10\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/15/1405440296371/1361de72-570d-4b54-b3c3-86340dbdec13-460x287.jpeg\" alt=\"U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington July 15, 2014.

PS: a reminder that social media stocks are being pummelled because of this: The Fed's warning that some company valuations may be too high (details here) helped push European stocks lower.

A few more quotes from Janet Yellen: YELLEN ON MAKING SURE NO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE TOO BIG TO FAIL \"We are completely committed with trying to deal with too-big-to-fail. We have put in place numerous steps and have more in the works that will strengthen these institutions, force them to hold a great deal of additional capital and reduce odds of failure.\" YELLEN ON OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF SYSTEMIC RISK \"Systemic risk in the financial system is not purely a question of too-big-to-fail institutions... We could have systemic risk if a large number of smaller institutions are hit for some reason.\" YELLEN ON HEADWINDS AND FISCAL POLICY \"I do agree with the view that there are substantial headwinds facing the economy. One example would be that we see in surveys of households that their expectations about their future finances and growth in their real incomes is exceptionally depressed and I think that's a factor that is depressing spending. We see in the housing market were we had some progress but it now looks like it's stalled... And fiscal policy has been a factor in my view holding back recovery and that's what monetary policy has had to counteract and that's in part why we've needed such an accommodative monetary policy\u2026 The economy is making progress\u2026 But to the extent that even when the economy gets back on track it doesn't mean that these headwinds will have completely disappeared\u2026\" Thanks to Reuters, here are some of Janet Yellen's most notable comments at the Senate banking committee today (highlights start here): YELLEN ON THE OUTLOOK FOR ASSET PURCHASES \"Purchases would cease after October, but if there were to be some very significant change in the outlook that we see between now and October so that we lost confidence that the labor market will improve for some reason, or that inflation would move back up to 2 percent, then we would have to rethink that plan.\" YELLEN ON LONGER-TERM PLAN FOR RATE RISES \"Even after we think the time has come to raise rates, we think it will be some considerable time before we move them back to historically normal levels... Of course we need to be cautious to make sure the economy continues to recover.\"\"This is not a pre-set course. If we were to judge the conditions changed significantly, it's not locked in stone.\" YELLEN ON WAGE INFLATION \"While rising compensation or wage growth is one sign that the labor market is healing, we are not even at the point where wages are rising at a pace that they could give rise to inflation. In fact real wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity growth; what we\u2019ve seen is a shift in the distribution of national income away from labor and toward capital.\"There is some room there for faster growth in wages and for real wage gains before we need to worry that's creating an overall inflationary pressure for the economy. That's something we are watching closely.\" YELLEN ON USING REPURCHASE OPERATIONS TO HELP CONTROL FUNDS RATE\" We've indicated that the main tool we will use is the interest rate we pay on overnight reserves. The overnight RP facility that you refer to I think of as a back-up tool that we will use to help us to control the federal funds rate, to improve our control over the federal funds rate. I think it's a very effective and useful tool. We have gleaned that from the initial testing that we've done. But as you mentioned, we do have concerns about allowing that facility to become too large or to play too prominent a role\u2026\" YELLEN ON WHETHER CONGRESS SHOULD REQUIRE A FED BOARD SEAT BE FILLED BY A COMMUNITY BANKER \"I am very positive on the idea of having a community banker appointed to the board. That said, I don't support requiring it by legislation... That's a road that could go further in a direction that would worry me. If we're earmarking, we could end up earmarking each seat for particular kinds of expertise.\" YELLEN ON LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT \"While long-term unemployment remains at exceptionally high levels and is a grave concern, I do think we are seeing improvements as the job market is strengthening.\" YELLEN ON TIMING OF RATE RISE The Federal Open Market Committee will be looking at \"maximum employment and price stability... There's no formula and no mechanical answer that I can give you about when the first rate hike will occur. It will depend on the progress of the economy and how we assess it based on a variety of indicators.\" YELLEN ON ECONOMY, RATE HIKE OUTLOOK \"My reading at the present time is that the (Q1) GDP decline is largely due to factors I would judge to be transitory, and I do think that negative number substantially understates the momentum in the economy. Of course this is something we need to watch carefully and are doing so....\"The Federal Reserve does need to be quite cautious with respect to monetary policy. We have in the past seen sort of false dawns, periods in which we thought growth would speed, pick up and the labor market would improve more quickly, and later events would prove those hopes to be unfortunately over-optimistic. \"We are watching very carefully. Especially when short-term overnight rates are at zero so we have no ability to lower them further, we need to be careful to make sure the economy is on a solid trajectory before we consider raising interest rates.\" Back at the senate Banking committee, Janet Yellen is asked what the biggest single threat to growth is. She doesn't really give a definite answer (perhaps unwilling to give an easy headline?), but cites housing as one area of concern; although it's not expected to hold back the economy. Here's some instant reaction to the Fed's warning about biotech and social media valuations: The Federal Reserve has sent stock markets falling by warning that social media and biotechnology companies may be overvalued. In its latest Monetary Policy Report, issued today, the Fed said that it doesn't believe overall equity markets are too optimistic. But it suggested that valuations in both sectors may have been driven too high. It explained (on page 20). Valuation metrics in some sectors do appear substantially stretched\u2014particularly those for smaller firms in the social media and biotechnology industries, despite a notable downturn in equity prices for such firms early in the year. Moreover, implied volatility for the overall S&amp;P 500 index, as calculated from option prices, has declined in recent months to low levels last recorded in the mid-1990s and mid-2000s, reflecting improved market sentiment and, perhaps, the influence of \u201creach for yield\u201d behavior by some investors. And that warning hit shares on Wall Street. The Nasdaq biotechnology index fell 1.4%, while Facebook shares lost 1.7% and Twitter dropped 0.8%. And the wider stock markets also lost some zip, with the FTSE 100 index now down 25 points in late trading. Most members of the FOMC believe the first interest rate rise will come in 2015, and the median prediction is that rates will be 1% by the end of next year, Yellen adds (that's just based on the latest projections - nothing new here) The Banking committee are pitching questions at Janet Yellen now, and the Fed chair showed some nifty footwork. Asked when she thinks interest rates might rise, Yellen explained that the committee has given guidance that it will assess its progress towards its two mandates of price stability, and maximum employment. There's no formula for when rates will rise - it depends on the progress of the economy, measured against a number of indicators. And with a helpful smile, Yellen directs the committee to the FOMC's latest economic projections. No repeat of her first press conference, when Yellen suggested rates might rise six months after the Fed stops expanding its asset-purchase programme. There's not much market reaction to Janet Yellen's prepared testimony - the pound did jump to a new near-six year high, but then dipped back. Sterling had already rallied after UK inflation jumped more than expected this morning, from 1.5% to 1.9% Janet Yellen also says the Fed expects to keep making measures cuts to the pace of its asset purchase scheme, and wil lend new purchases after the October meeting. That's in line with the minutes of the Fed's last meeting. Here's a few more key points from Janet Yellen's statement: On when interest rates may start to rise: If the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned. Conversely, if economic performance is disappointing, then the future path of interest rates likely would be more accommodative than currently anticipated. On Financial Stability: The Committee recognizes that low interest rates may provide incentives for some investors to \"reach for yield,\" and those actions could increase vulnerabilities in the financial system to adverse events. While prices of real estate, equities, and corporate bonds have risen appreciably and valuation metrics have increased, they remain generally in line with historical norms. In some sectors, such as lower-rated corporate debt, valuations appear stretched and issuance has been brisk. Accordingly, we are closely monitoring developments in the leveraged loan market and are working to enhance the effectiveness of our supervisory guidance. So, in summary..... Since the February Monetary Policy Report, further important progress has been made in restoring the economy to health and in strengthening the financial system. Yet too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective, and not all of the necessary financial reform initiatives have been completed. The Federal Reserve remains committed to employing all of its resources and tools to achieve its macroeconomic objectives and to foster a stronger and more resilient financial system. The Senate banking committee hearing with Janet Yellen is being streamed in several places -- this Wall Street Journal page seems to be running well. She's just begun reading her prepared statement. Janet Yellen's testimony to the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is online here: Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress In it, the Fed chair also outlines that US interest rates will remain well below historic levels for some considerable time: We currently anticipate that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the federal funds rate below levels that the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Just in -- Janet Yellen is telling Senators on the Banking Committee that America's economic recovery is incomplete. And with wages stagnant, and the labour market still weak, loose monetary policy can still be justified for the foreseeable future. That's the highlights from her prepared testimony, as her testimony begins. Reuters has more details: In a strong defense of the central bank's current stance, Yellen said that early signs of a pickup in inflation aren't enough for the Fed to accelerate its plans for raising interest rates, a move currently expected in the middle of next year. That could change, with interest rates rising sooner and faster, if data show labor markets improving more quickly than expected, she said.But as it stands, \"although the economy continues to improve, the recovery is not yet complete,\" Yellen said in semi-annual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, repeating her focus on lagging labor force participation and weak wage growth as key to any conclusions about the economy's health. \"Too many Americans remain unemployed,\" Yellen said.Yellen presented a broad overview of an economy still in transition from the 2007-2009 economic crisis. In an accompanying report, the Fed said its balance sheet would top out at $4.5 trillion when its bond-buying program ends in October, a sign of how much stimulus the central bank has had to unleash to support the economy. More to follow.... Business Insider has a handy preview on Janet Yellen's appearance at the Senate Banking Committee: These are Yellen's first comments since her press conference on June 18, which followed the latest FOMC meeting. Since that meeting, we've gotten a bunch of economic data, headlined by the June jobs report. That report showed that non-farm payrolls expanded by 288,000 in June as the unemployment rate fell to 6.1%, its lowest level since September 2008. They also suggest that Yellen may be asked about a New York Times preview, in which the Fed chair says she didn't anticipate the problems caused by the 2005 and 2006 housing bubble The New York stock market has opened, and the Dow Jones industrial average immediately hit a new record high. The Dow jumped 50 points, or 0.3%, to 17,105, as Wall Street prepared for Janet Yellen's testimony (starting in around 20 minutes time). Here's our news story about Mark Carney's appearance at the Treasury committee today, folding in this morning's housing date from the Office for National Statistics:` Bank of England governor warns of a bubble as UK house prices rise 10.5% Good news for the global economy -- the oil price had dropped to its lowest level since May. The price of a barrel of US crude has just hit $100 per barrel, having been as high as $107.5 per barrel when the insurgency in Iraq broke out. There had been speculation that an oil price surge could shock the global economy and scupper the recovery, but prices now seem to be easing. Another example of markets being too relaxed about geopolitical risks, as the Bank of England fears? The Empire manufacturing survey, which monitors factories based in and around New York, has surged ahead of expectations to a four year high. The index jumped to 25.6 this month, up from June's 19.3, to the highest level since April 2010. It bolsters hopes that America's economy is recovering, having suffered a contraction in the first three months of 2014. Encouragingly, the New York also reported that: Labor market conditions continued to improve, with indexes pointing to a solid increase in employment levels and a slight increase in hours worked. More economic news is hitting the terminal. US retail sales have missed forecasts, after automobile makers reported a surprise drop in demand. Retails sales rose by just 0.2% in June, versus forecasts of 0.6%. But May's reading has been revised upwards to a 0.5% rise, from 0.3%. And excluding cars, retail sales were up by 0.4% Today's results also show that Goldman Sachs staff benefit from the jump in profits, with almost $4bn set aside for pay and bonuses for the last three months. Goldman explains that the bonus pool has deepened, in line with the rise in profits. Here's the key section: The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits) was $3.92 billion for the second quarter of 2014, 6% higher than the second quarter of 2013, reflecting an increase in net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for the first half of 2014 was 43.0%, consistent with the first half of 2013. Total staff decreased 1% compared with the end of the first quarter of 2014. The results are online here (pdf). Although Goldman Sachs posted a 15% jump in investment banking revenues (from deal making, underwriting debt issuances, and such like), other divisions struggled. Net revenues from trading in bonds, foreign currencies and commodities fell by 10%, while revenues from equity trading fell 15%. That reflects the low volatility environment which the Bank of England touched on this morning. At $1.95bn, Goldman's Q2 profits are up 5% compared to a year ago. Goldman Sachs chairman Lloyd C. Blankfein says the company is \"pleased with its results', given the \"mixed operating conditions during the last three months. Blankfein added: \u201cThis performance was driven by the diversity, strength and breadth of our global client franchise. Good client activity in Investment Banking and Investment Management as well as a better environment for our Investing &amp; Lending activities helped offset less favorable conditions for Institutional Client Services.\u201d Goldman's investment banking arm grew revenues by 15% compared with a year ago, and were 'broadly unchanged' compared with the first quarter. Just in: Goldman Sachs has just blasted through its profit forecasts. The Wall Street titan made profits of $1.94bn in the April-June period, which is the equivalent of $4.10 per share. That smashes expectations of $3.09 per share. It appears that Goldmans investment banking arm did better than expected in the last quarter, despite warnings that low volatility would eat into profits. More to follow! The hearing ends as it began, with committee chairman Andrew Tyrie criticising the Bank of England's proposals on leverage ratios. Tyrie urges the Bank of England to extend the deadline on its consultation process - a four-week slot isn't enough time. Carney agrees to consider it. And with that, a rather tetchy meeting is over. I'll do a summary shortly - but there's a swathe of banking news hitting the terminal.... The committee is concerned that the risks of misconduct in the financial markets is not being properly monitored by the Bank of England. Memories of a recent meeting, in which BoE policymaker Paul Fisher said it wasn't the bank's job to look for evidence of misconduct, have not faded. Mark Carney has gathered his thoughts, and launched a firm defence of the Bank's actions. There will be changes in how markets run, and we are helping to drive that process internationally. It will cover how these market work, how Libor is set, how the foreign exchange rates are set (an issue covered this morning), Carney insists. These reviews will have consequences, Carney insists. London is the centre of the financial world, and we need to ensure that it is trusted. And the governor then reiterates that these reviews do not focus directly on the equities markets. Because: Equity markets are the sole responsibility of the F  C  A. Deputy governor Andrew Bailey also insists that the Bank of England is liaising closely with the Financial Conduct Authority (the 'City regulator') on issues such as dark pool trading. He also declines to say exactly how much exposure the UK has to such pools (which allow investors to trade anonymously). But Bailey insists that there is a close exchange of information between the BoE and the FCA. (background: Barclays is accused of allowing high-frequency traders to abuse its dark pools and hurt other traders) George Mudie MP asks why the Bank of England has been so quiet about the risks of high-frequency trading and dark pools. Carney says he has given speeches addressing such risks. But this is a financial conduct issue -- one for the FCA. Mudie isn't impressed. He says Carney sounds like his predecessor, Mervyn King, saying he gave speeches warning about various dangers in the run-up to the crisis. Carney responds that the Bank is working with the FCA on the 'fair market review'. He's spoken with Martin Wheatley, head of the FCA, about issues like dark pools. Mudie demands details -- waving a book published in 2012 called \"Dark Pools\" that explored the murky depths of these environments. How many dark pools do we have in the UK? What proportion of trading does through them? Carney emits an audible sigh. These are questions for the FCA. How many dark pools do we have in the UK? Carney says he doesn't know, but the proportion of trading going through them is \"substantial\". Mudie, though, is alarmed that the Bank may be ignoring important risks. Mark Garnier MP presses the Bank of England's representatives about the issue of forbearance \u2013 what will happen to highly stretched mortgage-holders and struggling indebted companies when interest rates rise? The BoE argues that this is not a major threat to economic stability. Continuing forbearance ad infinitum would not be consistent with either of the Bank's key objectives, Mark Carney said. And Donald Kohn argues that \"when interest rates rise, it will be the context of a strong economy\". Wages will be rising, rents will be rising, property prices will be rising, Kohn says, meaning that people who lose their jobs because their employer can't afford debt repayments should be able to find more work. \"Rising interest rates will be a good sign.\" Martin Taylor (the former boss of Barclays), points out that it will be harder for lenders to extend the life of a mortgage, because people are already borrowing at longer timescale. Andrew Bailey makes the same point -- pointing out that unusually long mortgages are already common in countries like Sweden. If mortgages extend beyond when people's income falls off, we have a problem, Bailey warns..... We need to become \"more sophisticated\" in how those credit-constrained households behave in different credit conditions, Carney adds. But it will take time.... Mark Carney says the Bank of England is determined to improve its use of data to grasp exactly what's happening in the UK housing market. Andy Haldane, chief economist, has the remit. \"We need to start the use of big data...and substantially improve the use of analytics,\" Carney tells MPs. We need a better understanding of how credit-constrained households act in the medium term, he continues -- how these families respond to economic and monetary changes. A long discussion about the UK's vibrant buy-to-let market. Is the Bank worried about it? Mark Carney says the FPC looked at the market at its last meeting, and concluded that \"current underwriting standards in buy-to-let appear consistent with historical levels\". And deputy governor Andrew Bailey says the Committee will be \"very attentive to buy-to-let\", as part of its wider objectives. Steve Baker, Conservative MP for Wycombe, has a frank exchange of views with Mark Carney about the interest rate derivative products sold to small firms. My constituents have suffered losses because they bought these products, and now find that the cost of exiting them is high because of current monetary policy, Baker says. These businesses are hurting because bank rate is so low. Carney won't accept this one. It is \"hardly news\" that there is a cost in signing up to a fixed interest rate if rates subsequently fall. And he also reminds the committee of the big picture. If policymakers hadn't acted as they did since 2008, we could have seen the \"wholesale collapse of the financial system, and this debate would be irrelevant\". The Treasury committee moves onto the government's decision that ring-fenced retail banks should be allowed to sell simpler derivative products to their customers. These derivatives can allow a small business to hedge itself against future interest rate changes -- but many SMEs say they were wrongly sold them, and have suffered big losses. Andrew Bailey, deputy governor, agrees that banks have \"a dreadful record in the UK in selling hedging products\". But he, and the FPC as a whole, support the move. A year ago, Martin Taylor told MPs that allowing ring-fenced banks to sell derivatives was like allowing \"a fox inside the chicken coop\". Has he changed his mind? No. Taylor says he still thinks a full-blown ban would be better than allowing simple derivatives to be offered. Banks will push at the boundaries, he says. But still, he's happy to go along with the committee's decision. So what else could the Bank of England do to control the housing market, if the measures announced at the FPC's last meeting* aren't enough? Carney says the BoE is not contemplating any additional measures. But it could tweak its existing tools, for example. * - it wants banks to restrict the number of high income-to-value loans they allow, so that just 15% of loans are at 4.5 times income. Onto housing...and Mark Carney says that the UK housing market is the biggest risk to the durability of the recovery in the medium term. The Bank's fear is that lenders become too reckless -- granting loans that are too risky, leading to too much indebtedness. Carney explains that British people have a great record of repaying their mortgages, however deep their financial problems. That means they slash spending on everything else, hurting the wider economy. His colleagues also weighed in: BANK OF ENGLAND FPC'S TAYLOR - NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR HOUSE PRICES TO RISE FASTER THAN WAGES INDEFINITELY, BUT CAN CONTINUE FOR QUITE A LONG TIME BANK OF ENGLAND FPC'S KOHN - FPC CANNOT REALLY ADDRESS RELENTLESS UPWARD PRESSURE ON HOUSE PRICES Mark Carney touches on today's jump in inflation to 1.9%. He points out that the Bank's latest forecasts are that CPI only returns to the 2% target in three years. So today's reading may be a blip, due to clothing prices not falling as they usually do in June (see 9.45am for details) Some reaction to the session: PS: Ambrose Evans-Pritchard's interview with the head of BIS about risks in the market is here: BIS chief fears fresh Lehman from worldwide debt surge The Committee now asks about the Bank for International Settlement's warning that the international financial system is now dangerously fragile, and that central banks should rein in their ultra-loose policies. Mark Carney looks unimpressed by BIS's intervention, saying its views are \"interesting\", but made in a vacuum. BIS has no mandate, and isn't responsible to parliament, he point out. They are \"outside the political reality\". Carney also suggests it would be \"dangerous\" to start aggressively tightening monetary policy now, at a time when global investors are already searching desperately for 'yield' (as the rates of returns from many safe-haven assets have fallen sharply). The FPC's Donald Kohn says he \"profoundly disagrees\" that central banks destabilise markets. People sometimes forget that we, Mario Draghi, Janet Yellen et al don't actually know what the situation will actually be in a year - people sometimes think we know more than we do. Martin Taylor of the Financial Policy Committee also weighs in on the issue of volatility, and warns that investors aren't paying enough attention to political issues across the world. He says: The tendency of the markets to ignore geopolitical risk is just bizarre..... Adding: Let's hope this exchange is reported. Consider it done, Mr Taylor: Taylor has a point. In the last year, the Ukraine crisis has blown up, and the situation in the Middle East has deepened -- yet volatility has fallen over the last year. Mark Carney says he was trying to stimulate more volatility last month, when he said that interest rates might rise sooner than the financial markets expected. Asked by Jesse Norman whether the Mansion House speech was meant to \"shake up\" the markets, Carney replied \"absolutely\". It was designed to make market participants more aware of the risks, the governor explains, adding: We were concerned that markets were not reacting to a fairly long run of data that had been as expected, if not a little better, and there had not been a change in the prediction for the first rise in interest rates. But then, Carney repeats that he doesn't know when rates will rise, and it will all depend on the data. Andrew Bailey, Deputy Governor at the Bank of England, adds that the markets have not been as disturbed by events in Iraq and Ukraine as you might expect. That's a bad sign, Jesse Norman replies -- it suggests everyone is too complacent. Jesse Norman MP asks whether the MPC's forward guidance on interest rates has contributed to financial stability. Donald Kohn says forward guidance has contributed to the low volatility in the markets, alongside the economic recovery in the UK and the US. Mark Garnier MP points out that the leverage ratio will effect how much banks can lend, and thus the amount of money in the system. That sounds like a monetary policy issue -- isn't it time to merge the Financial Policy Committee (responsible for stability) and the Monetary Policy Committee? Mark Carney replies that he doesn't think we have reached a point where the two committee's should merge. The FPC and the MPC need different, specialist skills, he adds. Martin Taylor, another external member, denies that a higher leverage ratio will force banks to hold riskier assets. (background: the proposed global rule is that banks should set aside 3% of their overall assets) Donald Kohn, an external member of the Financial Policy Committee, throws his weight behind a time-varying leverage ratio. He tells the committee explains that he'd be concerned if the leverage ratio couldn't be raised alongside the 'risk-weighted ratio' (another capital requirement). But won't a time-varying leverage ratio encourage Central Banks to indulge in herding behaviour, Tyrie replies? He's worried that central bankers will all misread the state of the financial markets -- potentially keeping leverage ratios too low, and then \"running off a cliff\" when a crisis begins. Tyrie is concerned that the Bank is proposing a time-varying leverage ratio (ie, the amount of capital that banks must hold could change depending on the economic climate). Carney replies that its potentially better to be able to change the ratio depending on macro-economic conditions, rather than having a flat one for all seasons. Carney also corrects Tyrie for dubbing the leverage ratio as a mere \"backstop\". It's an \"integral part of the capital framework\", he insists. Andrew Tyrie then chides Carney for not giving MPs more time to digest its new consultation on the leverage ratio. 48 hours notice simply isn't enough. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Committee, is asking Mark Carney about the BoE's new proposal that UK banks should perhaps face a higher leverage ratio (effectively setting aside more capital to address potential losses) Why? Carney replies that the leverage ratio is designed to protect the system from risks that people think are low, but are not. What would a higher leverage ratio mean for the sector? It would mean a more resilient banking sector, Carney replies. And it would have the biggest effect on building societies and investment banks. Over at parliament, Mark Carney is appearing before the Treasury committee now to discuss Bank of England's latest financial stability report. It's being streamed live here. The Treasury points out that UK inflation is still below the 2%, just... A HM Treasury Spokesperson says: \u201cThe government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, with today marking the 6th consecutive month that inflation has been below the Bank of England\u2019s two per cent target. But the effects of the great recession are still being felt and so we have taken continued action to help with the cost of living, including cutting income tax, freezing fuel duty and reducing the costs of childcare. The job is not yet done and the biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that\u2019s delivering a brighter economic future. The jump in inflation is particularly bad news for UK households who have not seen a decent pay rise. Real wages only rose by 0.7% annually in the three months to April (the most recent data). Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency company World First, nails it: \u201cThe inflation data will encourage those economists and rate watchers looking for a tightening of Bank of England monetary policy this year, but for those who are seeing below inflation wage increases, the situation just got a little more painful.\" Marc Ostwald, strategist at ADM Investor Services, reckons inflation may fall back in July as summer sales begin to be counted by the ONS. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, says traders were taken by surprise by today's inflation data. The core data was strong too and means we\u2019ll be hearing more and more calls for an interest rate hike this calendar year. Core inflation (stripping out energy and food) jumped to 2%. The ONS also reports that UK house prices rose by 10.5% year-on-year in May, the highest rate since May 2010. London house prices surged by 20.1% year-on-year, a record level. Our friends at Telegraph Towers show how the pound jumped this morning: It looks as if inflation jumped because UK retailers did not offer such generous summer sales as usual in May. The Office for National Statistics explains: Clothing &amp; footwear: prices, overall, rose by 0.6% between May and June this year compared with a fall of 1.9% a year ago. Prices usually fall between May and June as the summer sales begin but this year the average prices of a number of products have risen. The main upward effect came from garments, particularly women\u2019s outerwear where there were upward contributions from nearly all items, the largest from trousers and skirts. Food prices also picked up month-on-month: food &amp; non-alcoholic beverages: prices, overall, rose between May and June this year but fell between the same two months a year ago. The upward effect came principally from vegetables, bread &amp; cereals, sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate &amp; confectionery and mineral waters, soft drinks &amp; juices. And air fares also rose between May and June: transport: prices, overall, rose by 0.6% between May and June 2014, compared with a rise of 0.1% between the same two months a year earlier. The largest upward contribution came from air transport, with average fares rising this year but falling in 2013, particularly on European routes. There was also a smaller upward effect from sea transport. Partially offsetting these movements was a small downward contribution from motor fuels with prices, overall, rising this year by less than a year ago. This chart show how the UK inflation rate has jumped back towards the 2% target, hitting its highest rate since January. Uk inflation was driven up by the clothing, food &amp; non-alcoholic drinks and air transport sectors, according to the Office for National Statistics. The retail price index, the broader measure of the cost of living, also jumped last month to 2.6%, from 2.4% in May. The pound has jumped half a cent against the US dollar to $1.713, as traders react to the news that the UK inflation rate has risen close to the Bank of England's target of 2%. Breaking: The UK inflation rate has jumped to 1.9% in June, much higher than expected, and up from 1.5% in May. Nearly time for the UK inflation data. Economists predict that the consumer prices index rose to 1.6% in June from 1.5% in May. As well as showing the cost of living, the data will also indicate how close the Bank of England is to raising interst rates. As Jeremy Cook of World First explains: Last month\u2019s CPI release fell to a 4 year low of 1.5% and further weakness would allow the Bank of England to lean on the lack of price pressures in a bid to keep monetary policy as loose as possible going forward. Global regulators have proposed shaking up the foreign exchange market to prevent traders from manipulating key benchmarks. The Financial Stability Board, chaired by Mark Carney, issued a range of recommendations this morning, following allegations that FX traders have conspired to rig the official currency rates. Their recommendations include widening the \"4pm fix\" -- when the daily rates are taken in a snapshot -- and forcing banks to harden up their internal control systems to address potential conflicts of interest. They say: The group recommends the fixing window be widened from its current width of one minute. It seeks feedback from market participants as to the appropriate width of the calculation window. The full consultation document is online here. It includes this chart, showing how 4pm London time is the busiest time of the day as traders try to make deals for their clients at the daily fix (there are allegations that some traders have shared information about big deals). However, the most volatile time of the day is 1.30pm, when much US economic data is announced. Sterling has dipped a little this morning, as foreign exchange traders brace for the flood of news, starting with the UK inflation data at 9.30am. The pound has fallen 0.15 of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.707. Investors continue to pile out of Portugal's Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo. Its shares tumbled another 8% in early trading, close to their all-time low, as fears over the Esp\u00edrito Santo group continue to swirl. As regular readers know, the crisis at Esp\u00edrito Santo International shook the markets last week, after the conglomerate delayed a debt repayment. The group, controlled by the Esp\u00edrito Santo family, has also been investigated for accounting irregularities. There's a good explainer here on the WSJ. Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo is partly controlled by the Esp\u00edrito Santo family, whose main holding, Esp\u00edrito Santo International SA, is in deep financial trouble. The bank has lent money to Esp\u00edrito Santo International and sold the holding's debt to clients. Shares in Europe's technology companies are dropping after Germany's Software AG cut its growth forecasts this morning. Software AG, which is one of Europe's larger business software makers, lowered its 2014 sales outlook for its biggest business, blaming project delays. Its shares have tumbled 14%. The knock-on effect hit Spanish IT firm Indra Sistemas, whose shares are down 3%. SAP, Europe's biggest software firm, is down 0.7%. Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has led the campaign against payday lenders, isn't impressed by the FCA's proposals: The FCA's clampdown on payday lending would still mean borrowers faced an annual repayment of almost 1,500% -- although in practice the cap would mean people only repayed double their loan. Britain's Payday Lenders will face new curbs on irresponsible lending, under proposals issued by the Financial Conduct Authority this morning. The plan will restrict how much they can squeeze out of borrowers who struggle to repay their loans. But they will still make payday lenders a more expensive option than other sources of lending. The FCA proposes that: Consumers will never need to pay back more than twice what they have borrowed, Someone taking out a typical loan over 30 days and repaying on time will not pay more than \u00a324 per \u00a3100 borrowed. There should be a cap of 0.8% per day for borrowers who pay back their loans on time. And a \u00a315 cap on default charges. This could drive some payday lenders out the market, the FCA reckons -- which could also push the least attractive borrowers into the hands of less scrupulous lenders. Reaction to follow.... Japan's central bank has also hit the headlines earlier today; lowering its growth forecast but leaving monetary policy untouched. It now expects the economy to grow by just 1.0% in the financial year to March 2015, down from 1.1%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, business and the eurozone. History, Simon Schama once explained, can come at you with a rush, knocking you down and wiping out your bearings. And today is one of those days when the news flow could sweep us off our feet too. Two top central bankers have the stage \u2013 at 10am, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, will be quizzed by MPs over the latest financial stability report. Expect plenty of questions about the UK housing market, amid signs that the BoE's tougher talk is cooling prices. And then at 3pm, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen begins testifying to Congress; the markets will be looking for hints on when the Fed might decide its safe to start raising interest rates. The earning's season will also kick off in earnest, Johnson &amp; Johnson, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs all reporting their latest results before Wall Street opens (so around lunchtime UK time). That could give stock markets the impetus to drive even higher... There's a flurry of economic news too. The latest UK inflation data is due at 9.30am. It's expected to show that the cost of living rose at a faster rate in June, with the Consumer prices index rising to 1.6%, from 1.5% in May. We also get the latest German ZEW Survey of economic sentiment at 10am -- showing if German firms have seen signs that Europe's latest economy is slowing down. Plus the latest US retail sales and Empire manufacturing report, both at 1.30pm, showing if America's economy kept bouncing back from its winter chill. And in the consumer world, Britain's payday lenders are being hauled into line \u2013 with the Financial Conduct Authority announcing new proposals to prevent consumers being stung. More on this shortly.... OK, it's not exactly the Norman Conquest, but it should keep us busy today....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan reported better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday even as poor trading conditions and a sluggish economy continued to be a drag on the Wall Street banks\u2019 profits. Goldman\u2019s second-quarter net income rose 5.5% to $2.04bn for the second quarter of 2014, up from $1.93bn a year earlier. The bank posted net revenues of $9.13bn, up 6%. The results beat analysts' forecasts, and shares jumped higher in early trading. Goldman, however, also reported a 10% drop in fixed income, currency and commodity trading revenue, to $2.22bn. Equities trading revenue for the quarter was down 13% from a year earlier, to $1.61bn. Wall Street\u2019s trading desks, their major revenue center for the last decade, have suffered in recent quarters. Goldman president Gary Cohen recently told investors that the sluggish pace of economic recovery and unusually stable markets were making it hard for traders to profit from swings in prices. Investment-banking revenue jumped 15% from a year earlier, and revenue at Goldman's investing and lending segment rose 46% from a year ago, to $2.07bn. Goldman set aside $3.92bn for employee pay and benefits, or 43% of revenue. The bank had 32,400 employees at the end of the quarter, up from the 31,700 a year ago, but down from the 32,600 reported for the previous quarter. JP Morgan reported a profit of $6bn compared with $6.5bn for the same quarter last year. Revenue declined 3% to $24.45nn. Both figures beat analysts' projections. The results came a week after Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive, disclosed that he has throat cancer. On a conference call, Dimon, 58, said the cancer had not spread. \"I'm hoping the next time I talk about this at all, in eight weeks or something, I'll tell you it's complete and the prognosis is very good,\u201d he said. Dimon said he still expects to keep working during treatment and will take \"a few weeks of rest\" after the treatment, as advised by his doctors. Like Goldman, JP Morgan reported more difficulties in trading. During the quarter, markets revenue \u2013 which includes revenue from its fixed income arm and equities trading \u2013 fell 14% from a year earlier to $4.65bn. The decline, however, was smaller than the 20% drop the bank had predicted in May. On the conference call, Marianne Lake, JP Morgan's chief financial officer, reported \"generally higher levels of activity\u201d in trading during the second quarter. Investment banking and advisory services picked up as more companies pursued mergers and initial public offerings. Merger advisory revenue jumped 31% and the bank's equity-underwriting revenue rose by 4%. A sharp slowdown in refinancing hurt the bank\u2019s mortgage business. Mortgage originations fell 66% from the prior year to $16.8bn. Dimon said the bank\u2019s business was still being buffeted by \u201ccontinuing headwinds\u201d but that he saw \u201cencouraging signs across our businesses\u201d toward the end of the second quarter. \u201cWhile it is too early to assume that this momentum will continue, we have confidence in the long-term growth of the economy,\u201d he said.",

Annual CPI inflation rose from 1.5% to 1.9% in June, but we expect it to fall back again in the coming months.

UK productivity has fallen from 85% to 75% of US levels in the past five years, reversing a process of productivity convergence that had been underway for the previous 50 years.

      "bodyText": "The huge public services outsourcing company Capita has been confirmed by the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, as the main contractor for the next generation of electronic tagging of offenders. The company has been managing the tagging of 100,000 offenders each year on an interim basis since April, when G4S and Serco lost the contracts as a result of overcharging allegations, which led to the two companies repaying nearly \u00a3180m. Grayling said the new six-year tagging contract would allow the introduction of a new generation GPS satellite-tracking tags for some offenders by the end of this year. While Capita will manage the overall contract a Redditch-based company, Steatite, will develop and manufacture the GPS tracking tags. Airbus Defence and Space will provide satellite mapping and Tefonica will supply the network. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the new tags would allow dangerous and repeat offenders to be tracked around the clock and could also be fitted to prisoners who are given temporary release from prison to monitor their compliance and conditions. The current tagging contract which has cost more than \u00a3700m since 2005 enables about 100,000 offenders to be tagged each year. Tags are currently used to monitor whether offenders released from prison under home detention curfew or under court curfew orders remain at an address. They are also used to monitor bail conditions. Grayling said the new technology would give Britain one of the most advanced GPS tagging systems in the world: \"This technology will allow us to keep a much closer watch on the most high-risk and persistent offenders who cause so much harm to our communities.\" The MoJ said all four companies \"faced strong international competition to win the contracts\". G4S and Serco were barred from bidding because of the ongoing police investigation. The MoJ claimed that the new contract would be delivered at a lower cost than the present contract and would deliver savings of \u00a320m per annum in its second and third year of operations. The ministry cited a \"net present cost\" of \u00a3228.8m for the six-year contract with Capita. Last August, the company said the contract would be worth \u00a3400m to them in revenues over the initial six-year term. The other three companies are to paid a total of \u00a336.8m in net present cost. The new contract will be expected to include a new group of offenders \u2013 those being released from short sentences under 12 months who are to be supervised on release for the first time under Grayling's probation reforms. The ministry spokesman said that the department would have far greater oversight over costs and charging than under the previous G4S/Serco contracts including direct access to the company's systems.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Food price rises and delayed summer clothes sales by high street retailers lifted Britain's inflation rate to a five-month high in June, well above forecasts. The bigger-than-expected rise in the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation to 1.9% in June from 1.5% in May will further cloud the picture for Bank of England policymakers as they weigh up price pressures in the economy and decide when to raise interest rates from their record low. Markets have priced in a rate increase from 0.5% by the end of the year but economists are divided over when the move will come. \"The news will further fuel expectations that the Bank of England will start raising interest rates sooner rather than later, with November looking the most likely month for the first hike,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at data specialists Markit, whose business surveys have shown activity picking up. \"With inflation almost hitting the Bank of England's 2.0% target, the housing market booming, the economy growing strongly with no signs of momentum being lost and unemployment plummeting, the case for higher interest rates is building,\" Williamson said. Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast a small rise in inflation to just 1.6% but a combination of factors lifted inflation higher, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The retail price index measure of inflation, which is broader and includes housing costs, also came in stronger than expected, rising to 2.6% from 2.4% in May. The main upward effects on CPI inflation, the rate targeted by the BoE, came from clothing and footwear, where prices rose between May and June this year but fell during the same period last year, which is typical for the summer sales season. An ONS statistician said there were signs that this year's warm weather prompted retailers to delay their usual discounts. Economists said this was likely to be reversed in July. There was also upward pressure from food and non-alcoholic drinks, where again prices rose this year and fell last year. Airfares rose by more this year than in 2013 and furniture prices also picked up more than a year ago. The unexpectedly strong pick-up in inflation took markets by surprise and the pound strengthened to a session high of $1.7133 after the data. Sterling has risen markedly against other major currencies over the last year as expectations grow that the Bank of England will move before other big central banks to end the ultra-loose monetary policy brought in during the financial crisis. \"It currently looks a very close call as to whether the Bank of England will raise interest rates at the end of this year or hold off until early-2015. Indeed, there will undoubtedly be many swings in interest rate expectations over the coming weeks and months,\" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. The Treasury focused on the fact that inflation was still below the target. \"The coalition government's long-term economic plan is working, with today marking the sixth consecutive month that inflation has been below the Bank of England's 2% target,\" said a spokesman. The Bank, which sets policy with a view to targeting inflation two years out, will also want to see whether wages are picking up and to what extent they could lift broader inflation in the future months. There was some reassurance for policymakers on pipeline inflation pressures in separate producer prices figures on Tuesday . The data showed producers' costs continued to fall last month and that there was barely any rise in what they charged customers \u2013 so-called \"factory gate prices\". The latest figures on pay are widely expected to show wage rises continuing to lag well behind inflation, so falling in real terms. \"In the near-term, inflation is likely to remain subdued with the producer price inflation figures highlighting a lack of pipeline price pressures while remarkably low wage rate numbers also point to little near-term inflation threat. The strength of sterling will also help limit the upside for inflation,\" said James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets. But with the economy growing by more than 3% this year and next and jobs being created, spare capacity was being eroded meaning the BoE would want to hike in November to head off higher inflation further out, he added. \"This would also remove political concerns of waiting until early next year when election campaigning is in full swing,\" said Knightley. Costly June As warm June weather persuaded shoppers to hit the stores for summer clothes, many retailers tried to cash in by pushing back their usual summer sales. Instead of the typical fall in June, clothing and footwear prices were up 0.6% this year, with women's trousers and skirts the main culprits. Food and drink prices also lifted overall inflation. Bread and cereals rose 1.2% in June while soft drinks were up 1.4%. But fish and fruit prices fell, as did wine and beer, while cost of buying spirits and tobacco increased. For those making an early getaway, air fares were up by 7% and boat journeys went up 5.2%. Furniture and furnishings picked up 1.5% but gardening gear fell 0.3%.",

      "standfirst": "Huge swaths of the manufacturing and service sectors have experienced several years of falling productivity", 
      "body": "<p>The productivity recovery shows no sign of happening. Productivity growth measured by output per hour was flat comparing the first quarter of 2014 with the previous quarter - and that has been the story for the last four years. That is bad news for many wage-earners, as ultimately only increases in labour productivity can support real wage increases. Many employers will be reluctant to push wages up while productivity performance is so dismal.</p> <p>One of the more striking features is the big differences across some industrial sectors. We have a few sectors where productivity has grown strongly and is above its 2010 level, a number where productivity growth has been stagnant, and some which have experienced a large decline. The table at the top of this blog gives more detail on productivity stars and laggards by industrial sector.</p> <p>There have always been differences between sectors and some of these contrasts will have sector specific reasons behind them, but the overall picture is that huge swaths of the manufacturing and service sectors have experienced several years of falling productivity. The best we can say is that in more recent quarters the fall has been checked in most sectors, but productivity has still to recover.</p> <p>If these sectoral differences persist, the Low Pay Commission could face a major difficulty in deciding how fast the national minimum wage can safely rise. In the commission's response to a request from Vince Cable published earlier this year, it made clear that productivity growth across the low pay industries was going to be one of the key factors in determining whether the national minimum wage can increase faster in future years. The problem for the Commission is that so far the productivity performance has been very uneven.</p> <p>holesale and retail has seen a rapid recovery in productivity in 2013, with the last figures recording quarterly productivity growth rates of 6%.

      "bodyText": "The productivity recovery shows no sign of happening. Productivity growth measured by output per hour was flat comparing the first quarter of 2014 with the previous quarter - and that has been the story for the last four years. That is bad news for many wage-earners, as ultimately only increases in labour productivity can support real wage increases. Many employers will be reluctant to push wages up while productivity performance is so dismal. One of the more striking features is the big differences across some industrial sectors. We have a few sectors where productivity has grown strongly and is above its 2010 level, a number where productivity growth has been stagnant, and some which have experienced a large decline. The table at the top of this blog gives more detail on productivity stars and laggards by industrial sector. There have always been differences between sectors and some of these contrasts will have sector specific reasons behind them, but the overall picture is that huge swaths of the manufacturing and service sectors have experienced several years of falling productivity. The best we can say is that in more recent quarters the fall has been checked in most sectors, but productivity has still to recover. If these sectoral differences persist, the Low Pay Commission could face a major difficulty in deciding how fast the national minimum wage can safely rise. In the commission's response to a request from Vince Cable published earlier this year, it made clear that productivity growth across the low pay industries was going to be one of the key factors in determining whether the national minimum wage can increase faster in future years. The problem for the Commission is that so far the productivity performance has been very uneven. holesale and retail has seen a rapid recovery in productivity in 2013, with the last figures recording quarterly productivity growth rates of 6%. Administrative and support services, which include significant numbers of low wage activities, has also showed strong productivity growth. In contrast, accommodation and food services after a modest revival between 2010 and 2012 has since lost ground and productivity growth is now 4% below its 2010 level. The productivity challenge in low pay sectors is one of the issues we will be addressing in our low pay event on 17 July. The problem is compounded by our inability to come up with a wholly convincing explanation for the productivity puzzle \u2013 why employers continue to hire in the face of very weak productivity, as this account of our recent productivity seminar by the director of the Foundation showed. This makes it hard to say when we can expect to see productivity recover. Whatever the reason, living standards for many in the near term are more likely to be boosted by falling inflation and the moderation in house price rises rather than faster wage growth. \u2022 Ian Brinkley is chief economist at The Work Foundation",
