      "bodyText": "UK banks should do more to protect customers tricked into transferring money to fraudsters, according to a consumer body that has lodged a \u201csupercomplaint\u201d with financial regulators. The move by Which? means banks could now face a formal investigation into whether they can continue refusing to reimburse victims. The organisation submitted its first supercomplaint this year in the same week that official data revealed that fraud in the UK payments industry had soared by 53% as criminals develop increasingly sophisticated tactics to steal bank customers\u2019 cash. Which? said banks should \u201cshoulder more responsibility\u201d when someone is conned into transferring money to another person\u2019s account, just as they reimburse customers who lose money due to scams involving debit and credit cards or fraudulent account activity. Some customers have lost considerable sums. In March this year the Guardian featured the case of Sarah and David Fisher, who were conned out of \u00a325,000 after a fraudster posed as their builder and emailed them a fake invoice that was virtually identical to the one they were expecting. The explosion in online and mobile banking means UK consumers now make more than 70m bank transfers a month, compared with just over 100m in a whole year just a decade ago. Which? claims that \u201cprotections have not kept up\u201d. Using its legal powers, the organisation has submitted a supercomplaint to the Payment Systems Regulator, the watchdog for the UK\u2019s \u00a375tn payment systems industry, which must now respond within 90 days. There are many financial frauds that directly target customers, such as phishing emails and phone- and text-based scams. However, among the biggest growth areas are impersonation and deception scams where fraudsters hack into someone\u2019s email account and then pose as the builder, solicitor, landscape gardener or other tradesperson that the consumer has legitimately employed. Typically, the victim receives an invoice via email, which does not rouse suspicion because they were expecting it. It looks authentic and is usually for the correct amount \u2013 however, unbeknown to the consumer, the bank account number and sort code have been changed to those of the fraudster. This is what happened to the Fishers, from north-west London. Last October they received a genuine invoice for building work that was being carried out, then what appeared to be a follow-up email from the same firm with a fresh invoice attached that included \u201cour new banking details\u201d. The couple duly paid the requested \u00a325,000, and while it quickly emerged they had been scammed, by the time the bank that operated the account used to accept their money was alerted, the cash had been withdrawn. Almost a year after the incident, they have yet to recover a penny of their money. Sarah Fisher, a record label manager, told the Guardian this week that the police had identified the fraudster as someone living in Denmark. As a result, the case was \u201cnot being progressed\u201d and had effectively come to a halt. She added: \u201cWe took it to the financial ombudsman, who said that Barclays [which operated the account] had not behaved improperly.\u201d However, she said their MP, Tulip Siddiq, had said the case raised important issues and intended to pursue the matter in parliament. Victims conned in this way currently have no legal right to get their money back from their bank, said Which?. Banks typically refuse to refund customers on the basis that they made the payment voluntarily. However, Which? said: \u201cConsumers can only protect themselves so far. People cannot be expected to detect complex scams pressuring them to transfer money immediately, or lookalike bills from their solicitor or builder.\u201d The organisation said banks had invested in security systems to detect and prevent fraud where they were liable to reimburse the victim, but added: \u201cThere aren\u2019t sufficient checks if someone is tricked into transferring money directly to another person\u2019s account.\u201d Which? said it wanted the regulators to formally investigate the scale of bank transfer fraud and how much it was costing consumers, and propose new measures and greater liability for banks to ensure consumers are better protected. The Payment Systems Regulator confirmed that it had received the supercomplaint and said it would examine the evidence Which? had supplied and gather its own, \u201cto build a clearer picture of the issue and decide a course of action\u201d. Possible outcomes might include regulatory action, a review or a referral of the complaint to another body.",

Theresa May has ripped up another part of David Cameron\u2019s legacy by scrapping quarterly meetings with what the government once described as a \u201csmall group of business leaders from sectors of strategic importance to the UK\u201d. The achievements of this business advisory group look to be, well, zero. The company bosses could not help Cameron to win the EU referendum and the scandals involving Sports Direct and BHS show that questions about corporate governance and employment practices remain unanswered. There was not exactly a chorus of disapproval when the news emerged on Thursday. The Federation of Small Business (FSB) said it was the \u201cright moment for No 10 to review its business engagement structures and to broaden them\u201d. The FSB said it has so far enjoyed \u201cexcellent engagement\u201d with May. The advisory group was dangerously opaque. There did not seem to be any selection criteria other than a tap on the shoulder from No 10. While the chairman and chief executives in the group \u2013 such as Alison Brittain of Whitbread, Bob Dudley of BP and Carolyn McCall of easyJet \u2013 undoubtedly approached the role diligently and passionately, what qualified them to give advice to the prime minister? Could they ever really put the interests of their own company to one side? To do so would have been a dereliction of their duties to the shareholders of the company they run. Lobby groups such as the CBI, Institute of Directors and the British Retail Consortium have been set up for the specific task of telling the government what businesses want. Handpicking a group of chairman and chief executives to do this risked creating a cosy club. It was great for the companies involved, but not for their rivals. The government\u2019s website said the business advisory group provided \u201chigh-level advice\u201d to the prime minister and senior ministers on \u201ccritical business and economic issues facing the UK\u201d. However, there are many other forums for business leaders to express their views and small businesses clearly felt it was unfair that these individuals got a foot in the door of Downing Street on the basis they ran big businesses. May must now ensure that she does not cut herself off from the business world. If Britain is to make a success of leaving the EU then the government needs to listen to the concerns of small, medium and large employers. Rolls-Royce chief\u2019s overhaul picks up speed Warren East, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, was a member of the advisory group and could have given Theresa May a few lessons on how to undo the work of your predecessor. Like May, East is overhauling the institution he inherited and has now replaced the finance chief. May wasted no time in ousting George Osborne but East has taken more than a year to bring in his own man as chief financial officer. David Smith, the former chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, is leaving Rolls to pursue other business opportunities. His replacement will be Stephen Daintith, who has the same role at the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust. This all means that in the last fortnight, East has poached Simon Kirby from the HS2 project to become chief operating officer, told staff that another 200 management roles are to be cut, and hired a new finance director. Rolls\u2019 half-year results in July showed revenues and pre-tax profits were down sharply, but East\u2019s desire to make it a more nimble company are well underway. Frankfurt sets out its stall to UK companies \u201cWe\u2019re not here to encourage you to leave London. We\u2019re not here to tell you Frankfurt is better or worse than London.\u201d So said Eric Menges, president of FrankfurtRheinMain, the inward investment agency for the German region, as he tried to, er, encourage businesses to leave London. The mayor of the Germany city, Peter Feldmann, was a little more transparent about the reasons for their trip to London. \u201cWe\u2019re on a marketing tour,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Frankfurt will become London\u2019s economic gateway to the European Union.\u201d London and the UK need to get used to this. Brexit will not just lead to business leaders considering whether to move jobs out of the UK, but other cities and countries actively lobbying them to do so. This is unlikely to just be with welcoming words, but with attractive financial offers. With negotiations about Brexit yet to begin, cities such as Frankfurt can offer certainty to businesses unsure about the future. This threat to jobs must not be taken lightly.",

    "webTitle": "Carney backs green finance to cut emissions and boost growth", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has thrown his weight behind the fledgling market in green investments to help cut carbon emissions and boost global economic growth. Carney used a speech in Berlin on Thursday to highlight green finance as an opportunity to boost financial stability while also tackling climate change. He said more of the $100 tn (\u00a376tn) held by big global investment firms could be channelled into green bonds to help finance initiatives such as water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Last year, $42bn of green bonds were sold worldwide. Carney made no reference to the Bank\u2019s stance on UK interest rates, which were cut to a record low last month to shore up the post-referendum economy. He did, however, discuss the global picture of low interest rates and how more investment in green technologies and projects to cut emissions could help raise them. \u201cThe Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates, but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others,\u201d Carney said. That was because the level at which interest rates must ultimately settle to ensure steady inflation \u2013 the \u201cequilibrium\u201d interest rate \u2013 was determined by fundamental factors driving savings and investment in the global economy, he said. Those factors included technology, demographics and inequality. Reprising his recent comments and those of other central bankers, Carney stressed that monetary policy alone could not address the world\u2019s economic problems. \u201cLong-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policymakers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies,\u201d he said. Carney voiced his support for structural reforms that encourage more private investment. He welcomed the Paris agreement on cutting carbon emissions and limiting the rise in global average temperatures, and called for a comprehensive climate policy framework within which companies would have enough information and certainty to make green investments. He conceded that to make green finance more mainstream would require \u201ca sweeping reallocation of resources and a technological revolution\u201d, but also saw potential benefits for global interest rates. \u201cThe International Energy Agency estimates that globally as much as \u20ac45tn [\u00a339tn] of investment in total could be needed in power supply and end-use efficiency to meet the two-degree target agreed in Paris. \u201cChina alone is likely to require around \u20ac500bn a year from 2016 to 2020 to finance its national environmental goals. A substantial proportion of this is likely to be raised offshore, absorbing excess global savings, helping to push up global equilibrium interest rates and ultimately increasing global growth.\u201d He called on the German government to take action when it assumes the presidency of the G20 group of countries next year. \u201cThe upcoming German presidency of the G20 now has a historic chance to mainstream climate finance and turn risk into opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe G20 \u2013 whose members account for around 85% of global emissions \u2013 has a unique responsibility. The German presidency could be decisive.\u201d",

But Carney\u2019s comments in a speech in Berlin offer little enlightenment on that subject, being more concerned with green financing. Katie Allen reports: Bank of England governor Mark Carney has thrown his weight behind taking the fledgling market in green investments mainstream to help cut carbon emissions and boost global economic growth at the same time. Carney used a speech in Berlin on Thursday to highlight green finance as an opportunity to boost financial stability while also tackling climate change. He made no reference to the Bank\u2019s current stance on interest rates in the UK, which were cut to a record low last month to shore up the post-referendum economy. But Carney did discuss the global picture of low interest rates and how more investment in green technologies and and projects to cut emissions could help raise interest rates. \u201cThe Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others,\u201d Carney said in his Arthur Burns memorial lecture in the German capital. That was because the level at which interest rates must ultimately settle to ensure steady inflation \u2013 the \u201cequilibrium\u201d interest rate - was determined by fundamental factors driving savings and investment in the global economy, he said. Those factors included technology, demographics and inequality. Reprising his own recent comments and those of other central bankers, Carney stressed that monetary policy alone could not address the world\u2019s economic problems. \u201cLong-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policy makers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies,\u201d Carney said. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece protests are back on the increase with seamen beginning a two-day strike and anarchists piling the pressure on ticket inspectors by taking over their department and calling for free transport. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The heavy price inflicted on Greece as a result of its rescue by bailout was rammed home again today as seamen \u2013 in the first of a series of autumn strikes \u2013 walked off the job in protest over pension cuts. Ferries plying routes between islands and the mainland will be stuck in ports until Saturday in a 48-hour strike that will cause havoc at a time when the country continues to enjoy a bumper tourist season. The cuts, part of reforms demanded by international lenders, have been branded \u201ctotally illegal\u201d by seamen who are likely to continue the industrial action in the months ahead. The walk-out came as anarchists also turned up the heat on the leftist-led government, rowdily occupying the offices of public transport ticket inspectors at the transport ministry. The protestors, part of a group that calls itself Rouvikonas, distributed leaflets that declared: \u201cworkers and passengers together for free transport.\u201d In a statement posted on the anti-establishment Athens IndyMedia site the group\u2019s members said they had carried out the sit in with the express purpose of getting inspectors to not only allow free travel but \u201callow the poor to get away with it.\u201d \u201cWe call on you to reject your role, reject this work, to allow the violators to get away with it. That simple,\u201d it said, insisting that many Greeks could simply not afford the \u20ac1.40 cost of a public transport ticket. At least ten were subsequently detained. Increasingly, inspectors have complained of attacks on homes and cars. This summer, the neoclassical building that houses OASA, the organisation of urban transport of Athens, was ransacked by anarchists making similar demands. Public transport, like public hospitals, has been hard hit by budget cuts with almost a third of the capital\u2019s total fleet of buses unable to be used for lack of tyres, batteries and other spare parts. Inspired by the US Federal Reserve keeping interest rates on hold, stock markets have surged ahead, although they did close slightly below their highest levels as a bit of profit taking set in. A jump in oil prices on hopes of a deal to support crude at next week\u2019s producers\u2019 meeting also helped sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 76.63 points or 1.12% at 6911.40 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2.28% to 10,674.18 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.27% higher at 4509.82 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 1.76% to 16,637.69 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 2.01% at 8934.9 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.78% to 572.15 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 114 points or 0.6% higher. Shortly after European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said Europe had too many banks, prompting suggestions that \u201czombie banks\u201d should be left to die, we get this. Reuters is reporting that troubled Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena might end up seeking state support. It said: European regulators expect Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena will have to turn to the government for support, three euro zone officials with knowledge of the matter said, although Rome would strongly resist such a move if bondholders suffered losses. Less than two months after the Tuscan lender announced an emergency plan to raise 5 billion euros of fresh capital, having come last in a health check of 51 European banks, there is growing concern among European regulators that the cash bid will fall short. While the bank is determined to see through the capital raising, if it were to disappoint, it would be left with a capital hole. Now euro zone authorities are considering whether state support would have to be tapped after what bankers have described as slack interest in the bank\u2019s share offer. \u201cThere is clearly an execution risk to the capital raising,\u201d said one official with knowledge of the rescue attempt, adding that the bank\u2019s value, about one ninth the size of the planned 5 billion euro cash call, would be a turn-off for investors. That person said a \u201cprecautionary recapitalisation by the Italian state\u201d could be used to make up any shortfall once attempts to raise fresh cash from investors had concluded in the coming months. Monte dei Paschi declined to comment. The Italian treasury did not want to comment for this story. A spokesman for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he was not aware of any expectations among European regulators that Monte dei Paschi may turn to the state for help... On Thursday, the Italian head of the European Banking Authority Andrea Enria told a newspaper, when asked about Monte dei Paschi, that, while he could not comment on individual banks, \u201cif state aid could be part of the solution, let\u2019s use it.\u201d Markets are holding on to their early gains. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The underlying message from the Federal Reserve was received loud and clear across global markets; \u201cWe\u2019re still not hiking interest rates so go ahead and take some risk.\u201d The risk-taking sentiment was evident in a rise in equities and commodities and a drop in the US dollar. Bad news for Portugal. The International Monetary Fund reckons its recovery is slowing, it needs structural reforms and the quality of its banks\u2019 assets is weak. At the end of a review of the country\u2019s economy, the IMF said: While Portugal is on a post-crisis recovery path, its economy continues to suffer from meager growth, weak investment, and competitiveness challenges. Its banking sector holds too many nonperforming loans and public debt remains high. On the state finances the IMF said: With low growth and low investment but high sovereign debt, what Portugal needs at this point is a cumulative fiscal consolidation of 1 percent of GDP over two years. This would offset the fiscal loosening of 2015 and what the IMF staff projects for this year. As for structural reforms, the IMF said: The economy had favorable tailwinds for a while, with low interest rates, a weak euro, and low oil prices, but the effect of that has washed out fairly quickly. Now some of the structural bottlenecks need to be removed to raise potential growth. It said the country\u2019s energy costs and unemployment level, especially among the young, were both too high: Portugal has to rejig its labor market, which is currently characterized by a combination of onerous and rigid permanent contracts and flexible but precarious temporary contracts. The way to do so is to make permanent contracts more flexible while improving the benefits available for those on temporary contracts, so that the two kinds of contracts converge. The goal is to bridge the gap, ensuring that there is a fair labor market for all, which boosts incentives for employment creation. Over to the eurozone, and consumer sentiment edged higher in September despite the continuing concerns over Brexit. The European Commission said the initial estimate of its consumer confidence indicator came in at -8.2 points from -8.5 points in August, in line with expectations. In the wider European Union the figure was -6.4 points, up 1.3 points. Well, we knew there have been mixed signals from the US economy, hence the Federal Reserve\u2019s reluctance to raise rates this month. Now come some weaker than expected housing figures to emphasise the point. Existing home sales fell by 0.9% to an annual rate of 5.33m units in August, according to the National Association of Realtors. Economists had been expecting a 1.1% rise to 5.45m units. July\u2019s figures was revised down marginally from 5.39m to 5.38m. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Healthy labor markets in most the country should be creating a sustained demand for home purchases. However, there\u2019s no question that after peaking in June, sales in a majority of the country have inched backwards because inventory isn\u2019t picking up to tame price growth and replace what\u2019s being quickly sold. Hopes of a meaningful sales breakthrough as a result of this summer\u2019s historically low mortgage rates failed to materialize because supply and affordability restrictions continue to keep too many would-be buyers on the sidelines. Oil is also on the rise, helped by comments from the Russian energy minister ahead of next week\u2019s meeting of producers. There have been conflicting signals as to whether Opec and other producers would be able to agree measures to support the sliding crude price. But according to Reuters, Russia\u2019s Alexander Novak said he hoped there would be constructive talks about a cap on output. He added that Russia was ready to co-ordinate its actions on the global oil market. That was enough to help push Brent crude 1.8% higher to $47.70 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has climbed 2.2% to $46.37. In the wake of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to leave US interest rates on hold - albeit with the suggestion they may rise in December - markets are in buoyant mood. Taking its lead from Europe and Asia, Wall Street has made a strong start to the trading day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 133 points or 0.7%, while Nasdaq touched an intra-day high at the open, up 0.5% to 5323. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.4% higher. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is up 93 points or 1.3%, heading towards the high for the year, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 2.2% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 2.4%. Essentially, Mario Draghi is arguing that Europe has too many banks -- and that this is the root cause of the sector\u2019s problems. But he concedes that his decision to cut interest rates to record lows is also a factor. Draghi tells his audience in Frankfurt that: Low interest rates tend to squeeze net interest margins owing to downward rigidity in banks\u2019 deposit rates. But overbanking is also a factor in the current low level of bank profitability. Over-capacity in some national banking sectors, and the ensuing intensity of competition, exacerbates this squeeze on margins. Such over-capacity also means the sector does not operate at the efficient frontier, which is one reason why cost-to-income ratios remain high in some countries. Europe\u2019s banks really are a mess; just take Italy\u2019s bad debt crisis, or the anxiety over Deutsche Bank. Draghi\u2019s solution is that banks should \u201creview their business models to bolster profitability.\u201d Other, more drastic, options are available... Some quotes from ECB chief Mario Draghi are hitting the wires, as he opens the annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board in Frankfurt. And he\u2019s warning that overcapacity in the European banking sector is dragging back profitability. Boom! The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims has hit its lowest level in two months. Just 252,000 US citizens filed initial claims last week, an 8,000 drop on the previous week. That\u2019s the lowest since mid-July. It\u2019s also the 81st month running that the initial claims number has come in below 300,000 - which traditionally signalled a strong labour market. This confirms what Fed chair Janet Yellen said last night, about the US employment market recovering steadily. And prompts the obvious question.... shouldn\u2019t you have raised interest rates by now? Yellen\u2019s argument, though, is that there\u2019s no sign of the US economy overheating yet. Kristin Forbes also flags up that we simply don\u2019t know how Britain\u2019s economy will respond to the EU referendum result. But right now, she doesn\u2019t see any sign of a tsunami on the horizon: She says: Will consumers continue to be as resilient to the clouds of uncertainty about their relationship with the EU as they are to the frequent clouds and light rain outside? Will businesses continue to hire and avoid reducing their workforces? Will wages and domestic costs continue their gradual increase towards levels consistent with the 2% inflation target? How much and for how long will inflation be pushed up by the increase in import prices arising from sterling\u2019s depreciation? And even if the UK manages modest growth and a restrained increase in domestic prices over the next few quarters, will there be any negative events originating abroad that present risks? Which way these winds blow will determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy in the future. For now, however, the economy is experiencing some chop, but no tsunami. The adverse winds could quickly pick up \u2013 and merit a stronger policy response. But recently they have shifted to a more favourable direction. Oops-A-Daisy. The Bank of England has just released a speech being given by policymaker Kristin Forbes later today, after the embargo was broken (by the Wall Street Journal, I think) In it, Forbes says that Britain has coped better with the Brexit vote than expected -- echoing a theme in this blog today. But she also argues that the Bank should resist easing monetary policy again. (So we shouldn\u2019t expect her to vote to cut interest rates again this year.....) Here\u2019s the key section: Moreover, the initial effect on the UK economy of the referendum has been less stormy than many expected. Uncertainty in the run-up to the vote created less drag, meaning that the UK went into the summer with more underlying momentum in domestic demand in Q2 than previously believed. The survey data has been extremely volatile \u2013 volatility that makes capital flow volatility look mild \u2013 and may continue to ebb and flow based more on political than economic news. The commercial property market and housing market are weaker (although some of this softening preceded the vote). There is some evidence that companies are delaying major investments \u2013 which could lead to weaker employment, wages, output, and productivity growth in the future. But these forces have been partially balanced by strong consumer spending. Net exports are also poised to pick up and provide some support to the economy. Here\u2019s the full 20-page speech: Here\u2019s a great chart from Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Weisenthal, underlining how shares, bonds and commodities have rallied this morning. It also shows that every major currency has gained ground against the US dollar, while the cost of insuring government (using a credit default swap) has dropped. It\u2019s a funny rally, really. Every share in the German DAX index, and the French CAC, have rallied this morning, sending both indices up by around 2%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is still lagging a little behind, but still up 1.2% (or 85 points). Ninety shares are up, with only 10 lagging. And the pound and the euro have both strengthened against the US dollar -- usually that pushes share prices down (because it hurts exporters). The other curious thing is that the Federal Reserve did actually downgrade its long-term for the US economy last night (which is why it expects to raise rates more gradually). Although Brexit-related damage appears limited so far, insurance group Lloyds of London is already considering opening an office in another part of the EU. That would let the group shelter its insurance underwriting business from any turmoil if the UK leaves the European single markets. Where might Lloyds go? Well, Dublin, Paris and Frankfurt are all on the shortlist. Clearly, Lloyds isn\u2019t hanging around until Theresa May triggers Article 50 before plotting its next move. Inga Beale, Lloyd\u2019s chief executive, says: \u201cWe are now focusing our attention on having in place the plans that will ensure Lloyd\u2019s continues trading across Europe. We are making very robust plans. We could open a subsidiary in one of the remaining EU countries that will enable us to passport.\u201d Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector is growing strongly this month, according to the latest healthcheck from the CBI. In another survey that defies the Brexit gloom, factory bosses reported stronger order growth than usual in September. Output expectations for the next three months hit the highest level since June too, meaning manufacturers expect to boost their output in the run-up to Christmas. It\u2019s a relatively small survey - based on responses from 481 firms. But CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith is confident that the situation looks bright: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see that manufacturers are enjoying a lingering summer with output running at a strong pace and manufacturers\u2019 order books remaining solid, particularly amongst the food, drink and motor vehicles sectors,\u201d \u201cOur members tell us and our surveys show that the fall in sterling has boosted international competitiveness for many businesses, with export order books remaining well above average in September, despite weakening slightly,\u201d More here: Manufacturing output continues expanding at healthy pace Court news: Some background. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 has popped over the 6900 point mark for the first time in over a fortnight. The blue-chip index is up a healthy 75 points, or 1.1%, at 6910, with mining shares continuing to lead the charge. BHP Billiton and Glencore have both gained 4.5% now, thanks to the drop in the dollar (pushing up metals and coal prices). Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says traders expect US interest rates to be raised in December (as the Fed hinted last night). But they\u2019re also pleased that the Fed expects fewer rate hikes in 2017 and 2018. European stock markets are following their US and Asian counterparts higher, as investors react to the FOMCs decision to leave rates unchanged once again. Whilst the committee decided against raising rates, it has not given up aspirations of implementing a rate rise at least once in 2016. December has seemed the likeliest month for some time, with the Fed likely to want the US election in November out of the way before such an important shift is implemented. The shift in the Fed\u2019s dot plot expectations from 3 to 2 hikes in 2017 is most telling. The 2015 dot plot indicated expectations of 4 hikes this year, and the big shift in expectations shows the committee is likely to implement higher rates at a much slower rate than previously forecast. Not to be outdone, the European Central Bank has also warned that the Brexit vote is weighing down the UK economy. In its new Economic Bulletin, the ECB cites the EU referendum and the Chinese rebalancing as key risks They say: Looking ahead, global growth is expected to recover gradually. Low interest rates, improving labour markets and growing confidence support the outlook for advanced economies, although the uncertainty generated by the referendum in the United Kingdom on EU membership will weigh on demand in that country. As regards emerging market economies, economic activity in China is expected to slow, while the outlook for large commodity exporters remains subdued, despite some tentative signs of stabilisation. Risks to the outlook for global economic activity remain on the downside. But yet... the ECB also acknowledges that the market panic after June 23 quickly receded with \u2018most asset classes recovering their losses\u2019. And don\u2019t forget that the Guardian\u2019s new Brexit Dashboard shows that fears of a recession have not come to pass..... Important point: Although the Bank of England fears \u2018challenging times\u2019 ahead, it isn\u2019t actually forcing Britain\u2019s banks to set aside more capital to cope. Economist Rupert Seggins highlights the key section: The Bank of England has also given itself a pat on the back, for helping to avoid financial mayhem after the EU referendum. Its Financial Policy Committee say today: The financial system has demonstrated resilience to spikes in uncertainty and risk aversion. Core financial markets functioned effectively despite initial sharp price moves and particularly high volumes of transactions relative to normal levels in some markets. Bank funding conditions remained broadly stable. That reflected the consistent building of resilience in the financial system over recent years, extensive contingency planning undertaken by the Bank of England and financial institutions in the run up to the referendum, and the co-ordinated actions taken by the Bank after the referendum. Here\u2019s today\u2019s statement: Financial Policy Committee statement from its meeting, 20 September 2016 NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has warned that Britain is facing a \u201cchallenging period\u201d for financial stability following June\u2019s EU referendum. Even though the Brexit vote has not caused an immediate economic crisis, the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee is warning of troubling times ahead. In the minutes of this week\u2019s meeting, just released, the FPC says: \u201cAlthough financial stability has been maintained in the United Kingdom through a period of volatility ... the United Kingdom faces a challenging period of uncertainty and adjustment.\u201d And the FPC is also insisting that it won\u2019t relax the rules on banks, to help them cope with the Brexit vote aftermath. From the Bank of England, Jill Treanor reports: The UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union will not be used as a way to reduce regulation on the banking sector, policy makers from the Bank of England said on Thursday as they warned that Brexit poses a challenging period of uncertainty for financial stability. The Bank, providing a quarterly update on the health of the financial system, also said that the closure of the help to buy scheme - which runs its three year course at the end of the year - will not lead to a drying up of mortgage lending. Its Financial Policy Committee, chaired by the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney, focused on the risks posed by Brexit and also the \u201chigh degree of political and policy uncertainty in many advanced economies\u201d. The record of the FPC meeting on 20 September shows the members regard the outlook for financial stability as challenging. There is a risk borrowing costs could rise and that households will not make able to debt repayments. Commercial property prices have fallen and transactions at their lowest level since 2009, the FPC said, citing the heightened inverting about the economic outlook post-Brexit. European stock markets have hit their highest levels in two weeks, as investors regain their nerve. In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 36 points, or 0.5%, to 6871 points -- its highest level since 8 September. Mining stocks are leading the charge, thanks to the weaker dollar \u2013 which has made commodities more valuable. The French CAC and German DAX have both gained around 1%. Sterling is getting a lift this morning, and has pushing away from the crucial $1.30 mark. The pound has gained half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3079, as the greenback loses value against a range of currencies. Traders are selling the dollar after the Fed cut its forecasts for interest rate rises over the next two years. FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed expects the Fed to maintain rates at 0.25%-0.5% until December. \u201cWe trust the economy, yet not enough to tighten monetary policy\u201d this was the message sent by Chair Janet Yellen to markets on Wednesday to explain the motives for keeping rates on hold in September. Although the monetary policy decision was viewed as dovish which sent equities higher across the board and the dollar lower, the Federal Reserve has never been seen as divided so far this year. Three out of the ten voting members dissented against the decision, calling for an immediate rate hike, this made the call for a December rate increase much stronger. Although Yellen confirmed that a November meeting is a live one, her body language didn\u2019t really reflect high confidence and neither markets did buy it with only 12% priced in for a move in November.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are enjoying a little rally today, after the US Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold -- but signalled that a hike is really quite close. Honest. As we covered last night, Fed chair Janet Yellen painted a picture of a US economy that continues to recover, with solid job creation and little sign of inflationary pressures. But while three policymakers rebelled and voted to hike, the majority were happy to leave rates unchanged. Yellen made some encouraging noises about the US economy, saying she was \u201cgenerally pleased with how the US economy is doing.\u201d But with no signs of overheating, and more people rejoining the labour market, the Fed decided no to risk a recession by pushing rates up. As Yellen put it \u201cThe economy has a little more room to run than might have previously been thought. That is good news.\u201d Markets are now betting that the Fed won\u2019t raise rates until December (although November can\u2019t be ruled out). So that \u2018Hawkish hold\u2019 has pleased investors, sending Asian markets up overnight. European stocks have opened higher too, after seeing Wall Street gain 1% overnight. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Despite there being enough to suggest a rate hike in November or, even more likely, December, the markets were buoyed by the simple fact that the Federal Reserve opted for inaction yesterday evening. Also coming up today... The Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee is publishing its quarterly assessment of the UK, at 9.30am. This is the first one since the EU referendum vote. At 11am, the CBI publishes its latest industrial trends report; again, we\u2019ll be looking for signs of a Brexit effect. Plus, the latest US weekly jobs claims (at 1.30pm BST) and home sales (3pm). And two central bankers are speaking later... 2pm: ECB chief Mario Draghi addresses the European Systemic Risk Boards\u2019s annual conference 6.10pm: BoE governor Mark Carney gives the Arthur Burns memorial lecture in Berlin And in the City, insurance group Lloyds of London and pub chain Mitchells &amp; Butlers are reporting results.

But Carney\u2019s comments in a speech in Berlin offer little enlightenment on that subject, being more concerned with green financing. Katie Allen reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Bank of England governor Mark Carney has thrown his weight behind taking the fledgling market in green investments mainstream to help cut carbon emissions and boost global economic growth at the same time.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Carney used a speech in Berlin on Thursday to highlight green finance as an opportunity to boost financial stability while also tackling climate change.</p> <p>He made no reference to the Bank\u2019s current stance on interest rates in the UK, which were cut to a record low last month to shore up the post-referendum economy. But Carney did discuss the global picture of low interest rates and how more investment in green technologies and and projects to cut emissions could help raise interest rates.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others,\u201d Carney said in his Arthur Burns memorial lecture in the German capital.</p> <p>That was because the level at which interest rates must ultimately settle to ensure steady inflation \u2013 the \u201cequilibrium\u201d interest rate - was determined by fundamental factors driving savings and investment in the global economy, he said. Those factors included technology, demographics and inequality.</p> <p>Reprising his own recent comments and those of other central bankers, Carney stressed that monetary policy alone could not address the world\u2019s economic problems.</p> <p>\u201cLong-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policy makers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies,\u201d Carney said.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

Ferries plying routes between islands and the mainland will be stuck in ports until Saturday in a 48-hour strike that will cause havoc at a time when the country continues to enjoy a bumper tourist season. The cuts, part of reforms demanded by international lenders, have been branded \u201ctotally illegal\u201d by seamen who are likely to continue the industrial action in the months ahead. </p> <p>The walk-out came as anarchists also turned up the heat on the leftist-led government, rowdily occupying the offices of public transport ticket inspectors at the transport ministry.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eight of the world\u2019s top industrialised nations lowered their corporation tax rates last year or announced plans to do so, according to a leading thinktank. In the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s annual report on tax changes around the world, published on Thursday, the thinktank said Japan, Spain, Israel, Norway and Estonia had all lowered their tax rates for corporate profits in 2015. Meanwhile, future reductions had been announced by Italy, France and the UK, while Japan planned further cuts. The OECD said the 2015 downward trend was accelerating as governments around the world emerged from the aftermath of the 2008 banking crisis and began using their tax policies more aggressively to chase GDP growth. In particular, countries were vying with one another to offer foreign multinationals the most attractive tax rate in an effort to attract investment. \u201cWith regard to corporate income tax, rate reductions had generally slowed down after the crisis but seem to be picking up again,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe trend seems to be gaining renewed momentum.\u201d The OECD findings may make uncomfortable reading for many politicians who have recently claimed to be leading the battle to make big global corporations pay more tax. A string of revelations about ultra-low tax bills among many of the world\u2019s largest businesses \u2013 including Apple, Vodafone, Starbucks and Google \u2013 has led to widespread public anger. The OECD suggested cuts in corporation tax were being partially offset by rises in other taxes such as VAT, fuel and car tax. Many tax justice and inequality campaigners have pointed out this trend hits poorer individuals hardest. The Tax Justice Network notes that it \u201credistributes wealth upwards\u201d. \u201cGovernments make up shortfalls [from corporation tax cuts] by levying higher taxes on other, less wealthy sections of society, or by cutting back on essential public services, so tax \u2018competition\u2019 boosts inequality and deprivation,\u201d the Tax Justice Network has said. OECD experts said lower corporation tax rates may indeed boost GDP but were also likely to heap pressure on other nations to follow suit and lower the rate of tax they levied on corporate profits. Critics of tax competition have called this a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d. The OECD said the average tax rate for corporate profits had declined from 32% in 2000 to 26% in 2008. The rate of decline then slowed \u2013 the average reaching 25% last year \u2013 but now looks to be quickening once again, the OECD said. Meanwhile, the average rate of VAT \u2013 a tax that falls hardest on the poor \u2013 has climbed from 17.6% in 2008 to a record high of 19.2% at the start of 2015. The UK was not among those OECD countries to have reduced corporation tax rates last year, but the then chancellor, George Osborne, did announce that the rate would steadily fall to 17% by 2020. It had been 28% when Osborne took office in 2010. He has repeatedly boasted of giving the UK the most competitive corporation tax rate of any G20 nation. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, OECD tax experts insisted world leaders were increasingly aware of concerns that aggressive tax competition was leading to wider income and wealth inequality. \u201cIn the past, a very big focus of tax policy has been on achieving revenue collection \u2026 supporting [GDP] growth,\u201d said David Bradbury, the thinktank\u2019s head of tax policy and statistics. \u201cPeople have often left the question of income inequality \u2013 redistribution \u2013 to other levers of policy, particularly government spending. But tax policy has a critical role to play also in addressing those important questions of inequality.\u201d Earlier this month, leaders attending the G20 summit in Hangzhou asked the OECD and the International Monetary Fund to explore ways of using tax reforms to better foster GDP growth while at the same time curbing income and wealth inequalities. While progressive taxes rates for personal and corporate income are in decline in many countries, OECD experts said there were other options for governments to explore. These include wealth taxes and measures to closing tax breaks on mortgage expenditure and pension contributions \u2013 incentives that largely benefit better-off individuals. More broadly, the OECD said that industrialised nations wishing to increase tax revenue could do much more to tax property and carbon-heavy fuels such as coal. \u201cThe potential to raise revenues in an efficient way through property taxes, especially through recurrent taxes on residential property, is not being fully exploited,\u201d the report concluded, although it found the highest property taxes were in the UK. Meanwhile, OECD figures showed that countries were failing to align those taxes that have an impact on the environment with international ambitions to move to a low-carbon economy. In particular, road transport was heavily taxed despite the fact that other sectors make up 85% of CO2 emissions. \u201cThe potential for harnessing the power of taxes as environmental policy instruments is large,\u201d the report said, noting that there were currently \u201cparticularly low taxes on some of the most environmentally harmful fuels, notably coal\u201d.",

Smith, the former chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, is leaving Rolls to \u201cpursue other business interests\u201d, the company said in a stock market statement. The departure of Smith comes after East named Simon Kirby, chief executive of the HS2 project, as the company\u2019s new chief operating officer, and told staff that Rolls would cut another 200 management roles. East became Rolls boss last year and is restructuring the company in the face of falling revenues and profits.

The company\u2019s workforce fell from 54,100 in 2014 to 50,500 in 2015, according to its latest annual report, with more cuts still to come. Smith will stay at Rolls until the new year to \u201censure an effective transition\u201d, with a date not yet set for Daintith\u2019s arrival.

    "webTitle": "EU chief calls on ex-commissioner to explain undeclared offshore role", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jean-Claude Juncker has called on former EU commissioner Neelie Kroes to explain why she failed to declare a directorship in an offshore firm, amid calls to tighten up the union\u2019s ethics code. The European commission president \u201cis seeking clarification\u201d from Kroes after it emerged she had failed to report a directorship at a United Arab Emirates-funded venture during her time in Brussels, a spokesman for Juncker said on Thursday. The spokesman said the commission will decide on the next steps and actions once all the facts were known. \u201cWe have very strict rules in place and it is important that these rules are respected by all those who have the honour to serve as members of the college [of commissioners].\u201d All European commissioners are obliged to declare outside interests, stretching back 10 years. Kroes, the veteran Dutch liberal politician, served as commissioner for two terms from 2004-2014, initially with the powerful role of competition watchdog, before taking charge of the EU\u2019s high-profile digital agenda. During that time, she failed to declare she was a director of a Bahamas company set up to buy the international assets of energy firm Enron in a $7bn venture funded by United Arab Emirates families. Lawyers for Kroes have admitted she should have declared the directorship in Mint Holdings Ltd, an unpaid post she held for more than nine years between 2000-09. They say she made her declaration in good faith and omitted the information from her list of previous posts because the deal with Enron collapsed and the company, Mint Holdings Limited, never became operational. The disclosure came to light following an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists into a trove of unseen documents leaked from the Bahamas corporate registry. Kroes was one name among many from the files, which listed directors and shareholders at nearly 176,000 shell companies, trusts and foundations. After being approached by journalists, lawyers for Kroes wrote to Juncker at the end of last week, but their email was not spotted until Wednesday. The European commission president has written to Kroes and \u201cthere is clearly an expectation that this should be followed up very quickly\u201d, one source said. A lawyer for Kroes said: \u201cThe President of the European commission this morning has written to Mrs Kroes requesting further details about her directorship of Mint Holdings Ltd. Mrs Kroes will reply to this letter as soon as possible. Mrs Kroes understands that the president needs further information to asses the situation.\u201d The EU commission also said it was looking into whether any of the decisions that Kroes had taken as competition commissioner had touched upon Mint Holdings. The former commissioner became known as \u201cSteelie Neelie\u201d for taking on former state-owned energy companies, as well as multinationals including Microsoft. The revelations are damaging for the commission, which is still grappling with the outcry over former commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso\u2019s decision to join Goldman Sachs to advise their clients on Brexit. If Kroes is found to have breached the EU\u2019s code of conduct \u2013 which requires commissioners to behave with \u201cintegrity and discretion\u201d \u2013 she could be stripped of her right to an EU pension and may have to repay a generous transitional allowance granted to all commissioners once they leave office. Kroes is 75, but does not currently receive an EU pension. Kroes is entitled to just under \u20ac460,000 (\u00a3395,000), depending on how much she is earning from jobs in the private sector. Depending on length of service, commissioners are allowed to claim up to 65% of their final basic salary after leaving Brussels. They have an initial cooling-off period of 18 months during which time they must seek permission before taking a job in the private sector \u2013 but the transitional allowance is paid for three years. Kroes has also attracted controversy by joining the advisory board of technology group Uber, accepting an advisory role at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and becoming a full board member at US corporation Salesforce. In order to secure her job as competition commissioner in 2004, Kroes undertook to never again take a post in the private sector. Challenged on why Kroes, now 75, had gone back on her promise, her lawyer said: \u201cIt is true that Mrs Kroes made this pledge at the beginning of her first term with the European commission. Having fulfilled this term, Mrs Kroes fulfilled this pledge and did not enter into business activity. Instead, she was honoured with a second term in a completely different field. Having now finished her second term, she no longer feels bound by the commitment made prior to taking her first post.\u201d Any decision on pensions or allowances would require a decision by the European court of justice, following a referral by the commission. However, Carl Dolan, European director of the campaign group Transparency International, said: \u201cThese are breaches of social norms so there should be social sanctions. In cases like Kroes\u2019 where it is clear the rules have been broken, it should be made clear they are not welcome in the institutions.

She called on the commission to strengthen its code of conduct, which sets the ground rules for ethical standards that current and former commissioners should observe. The commission spokesman did not support calls to update the code, saying: \u201cThe commission must be able to trust in the accuracy and completeness of the information provided by the commissioners. \u201cThere are certain things that even the strictest rules, like ours, cannot fix,\u201d he added. \u201cThis was the case of our former president who made the choice to go to work for a certain bank and this is now the case of a former commissioner, who apparently did not respect the rules, and apparently did not inform the commission.\u201d Speaking more widely about the revelations from the Bahamas corporate registry, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for taxation, described them as \u201cthe latest proof of the enormous scale of global tax avoidance and evasion\u201d. He stepped up calls for EU member states to agreed an EU blacklist of tax havens by 2017, with \u201cstrong and viable sanctions for countries that refuse to play by the book\u201d and \u201cprovide a hiding-place for untaxed wealth\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Amber Rudd is facing growing calls to clarify the extent of her involvement in tax havens following the Guardian\u2019s disclosure that she had been a director of two companies in the Bahamas. The home secretary\u2019s name appears in a leaked list of directors of companies from the Caribbean tax haven, which was obtained by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Rudd served as a director of the Advanced Asset Allocation Fund and Advanced Asset Allocation Management from 1998 to 2000, according to the documents. A spokesperson for Rudd said that her business career prior to politics was public knowledge, but did not respond to detailed questions about whether the companies had paid UK tax or whether Rudd had invested in them. Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, called for Rudd to elaborate upon what her precise role in the offshore structure had been. \u201cWe cannot expect hardworking members of the public to pay their tax bills when they feel that those at the top of our society can use offshore schemes to avoid paying their fair share,\u201d he said. \u201cAmber Rudd may have done nothing wrong but refusing to clarify her role in setting up this scheme undermines public trust in our tax system. She has a duty to be totally transparent if she wants the power to make laws that govern us all.\u201d Jon Ashworth MP, the shadow minister without portfolio, described Rudd\u2019s appearance in the leaked Bahamas documents as embarrassing. \u201cEarlier in the year Amber Rudd was sent out to defend David Cameron amid controversy over offshore holdings,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAt the time she trumpeted transparency yet she made no mention of her own situation, which was surely relevant to claims amid calls for openness at the top of the Tory party. People will be forgiven for wondering what the true picture is and they deserve an answer from Amber Rudd.\u201d Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics show, Green MEP Molly Scott Cato called for Rudd to make a fuller statement explaining the purpose of the directorships and whether she had personally profited. Scott Cato criticised Rudd for failing to disclose the Bahamas links when defending Cameron after he admitted he had previously held shares in his father\u2019s offshore investment fund, which was included in the Panama Papers. \u201c[Rudd] didn\u2019t say at that stage that she also had been involved in business in tax havens and I think she needs to explain why she didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. The tax transparency advocate Richard Murphy said Rudd\u2019s new role as home secretary, to which she was appointed earlier in the year by Theresa May, was fundamentally in conflict with her past use of offshore companies. \u201cThe contradictions between the task of the home secretary and the role of secrecy jurisdictions is immediately apparent: one is tasked with upholding the law that secrecy jurisdictions and their users seek to subvert. It is very hard to think of roles more juxtaposed,\u201d he wrote. Murphy said the fact that Rudd had never acknowledged her previous connection to the offshore world called into doubt her suitability for her present government position. \u201cI will be explicit: you cannot, in my opinion, believe that secrecy jurisdictions like the Bahamas have a valid role when that role is to undermine the rule of law in other countries and also be UK home secretary.\u201d The Guardian approached Rudd on a number of occasions earlier this week but was told she did not intend to comment further.",

      "bodyText": "Three former Tesco directors have been accused of acting dishonestly for personal gain as they appeared in court to answer charges of fraud and false accounting in relation to a \u00a3263m-plus scandal at the supermarket chain. Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK, Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK, and John Scouler, the supermarket group\u2019s former commercial director for food, were all charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. The charges read out at Westminster magistrates court alleged that as senior employees at the supermarket they had abused their seniority for personal gain. The trio were also accused of dishonestly falsifying Tesco\u2019s digital accounting records and its draft interim accounts by the \u201cinputting of and/or reliance upon commercial income figures which gave a false account of the financial position of Tesco\u201d. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said the alleged activity took place between February and September 2014. The three men could face up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of fraud by abuse of position and seven years for false accounting. They all plead not guilty to both charges. The three former colleagues sat side by side in the dock.. The men spoke only to confirm their name, age and address during the half-hour hearing. Judge Vanessa Baraitser said the case was being referred to Southwark crown court, with the former supermarket executives told they would next have to appear on 20 October. The SFO investigation into Tesco is ongoing and it is still possible that further individuals could face action. However, it is understood that the former chief executive Philip Clarke, who was questioned under caution by the SFO, will not be charged. When the SFO\u2019s decision to charge the executives was announced this month Tesco said it continued to cooperate with the investigation: \u201cThe last two years have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time,\u201d it said at the time. The SFO launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014 after the company admitted it had overstated profits by \u00a3263m because it had incorrectly booked payments from suppliers, relating to issues such as marketing costs or reaching sales targets. The scandal came to light after a whistleblower alerted the company\u2019s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, who took over in September 2014. A team of forensic accountants from Deloitte then established that Tesco had artificially inflated an estimate of first-half profits given to the City in August 2014. They also found similar practices had been in place in previous reporting periods. In April 2015, Tesco said it had found a further \u00a360m in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations. Rogberg and Scouler left Tesco in November 2014. The two men, and Bush, were members of the so-called Cheshunt Eight \u2013 named after the location of Tesco\u2019s Hertfordshire head office \u2013 who were suspended when the profits overstatement first came to light.",

The three men could face up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of fraud by abuse of position and seven years for false accounting. They all plead not guilty to both charges. </p> <p>The three former colleagues sat side by side in the dock.. The men spoke only to confirm their name, age and address during the half-hour hearing. </p> <p>Judge Vanessa Baraitser said the case was being referred to Southwark crown court, with the former supermarket executives told they would next have to appear on 20 October. </p> <p>The SFO investigation into Tesco is ongoing and it is still possible that further individuals could face action. However, it is understood that the former chief executive Philip Clarke, who was questioned under caution by the SFO, will not be charged.</p> <p>When the SFO\u2019s decision to charge the executives was announced this month Tesco said it continued to cooperate with the investigation: \u201cThe last two years have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time,\u201d it said at the time.</p> <p>The SFO launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014 after the company admitted it had overstated profits by \u00a3263m because it had incorrectly booked payments from suppliers, relating to issues such as marketing costs or reaching sales targets.</p> <p>The scandal came to light after a whistleblower alerted the company\u2019s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, who took over in September 2014. A team of forensic accountants from Deloitte then established that Tesco had artificially inflated an estimate of first-half profits given to the City in August 2014. They also found similar practices had been in place in previous reporting periods. In April 2015, Tesco said it had found a further \u00a360m in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations.</p> <p>Rogberg and Scouler left Tesco in November 2014. The two men, and Bush, were members of the so-called Cheshunt Eight \u2013 named after the location of Tesco\u2019s Hertfordshire head office \u2013 who were suspended when the profits overstatement first came to light.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lloyd\u2019s of London plans to be ready to open an office in another EU country the day Theresa May\u2019s government triggers article 50 to begin formal negotiations to leave the union. The world\u2019s oldest insurance market is drawing up contingency plans to protect its business from the impact of Brexit, which will be implemented as soon as the UK begins divorce proceedings from the EU, expected early next year. Inga Beale, Lloyd\u2019s chief executive, said several cities were being considered for the new subsidiary, including Dublin, Paris and Frankfurt. This would involve moving some staff from London. Lloyd\u2019s is considering setting up an EU-wide subsidiary or branches in several member states. \u201cWe are now focusing our attention on having in place the plans that will ensure Lloyd\u2019s continues trading across Europe,\u201d Beale said. \u201cWe are making very robust plans. We could open a subsidiary in one of the remaining EU countries that will enable us to passport.\u201d The issue of passporting \u2013 which allows UK authorised banks, insurers and fund managers to conduct business in the other 27 EU states \u2013 is crucial. Data from the Financial Conduct Authority published this week showed almost 5,500 UK firms rely on corporate \u201cpassports\u201d to conduct business across the EU. John Nelson, the Lloyd\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cOur aim is to have a contingency plan so we can write business onshore in the EU ready by the time article 50 is triggered.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s would lose about \u00a3800m of premiums if it lost passporting rights, 4% of the total. More could be at risk as a result of the Brexit vote, Beale said \u2013 nearly \u00a33bn, or 11% of Lloyd\u2019s premiums, comes from continental Europe. She described the fallout from the Brexit vote as a \u201cmajor issue for us to deal with\u201d, one of the biggest challenges faced by Lloyd\u2019s in its history. But the group will keep its London base. \u201cThis has been our home for 328 years and it will remain our headquarters.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s is lobbying the government to maintain passporting rights for the organisation and its 97 syndicates. It is a market where insurers do business via brokers. Many insurers are also drawing up contingency plans and are considering setting up subsidiaries in another EU country to retain access to the single market. Lloyd\u2019s, which began as a coffee house in the City where merchants and shipowners met, provides specialist insurance such as marine, energy and political risks, and recently provided cover for a Cadbury\u2019s scientist\u2019s taste buds. The group reported a profit of \u00a31.46bn for the first half of this year, up 22% from \u00a31.2bn a year ago. The results were boosted by the strengthening of the dollar against sterling post the EU referendum and better investment returns, \u201cneither of which represent sustainable profitability\u201d, it said. Lloyd\u2019s highlighted big claims from the Fort McMurray wildfires in Alberta, Canada, and said premiums continued to be under pressure. Beale, Nelson, and Lloyd\u2019s former chief risk officer Sean McGovern had strongly campaigned for a remain vote. The Lloyd\u2019s figures showed gross premiums rose to \u00a316.3bn from \u00a315.5bn in the first half, and the return on capital improved to 11.7% from 10.7%. The firm has continued its global push, opening a new office in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and applying for onshore reinsurance licences in India and Malaysia. Beale said Lloyd\u2019s would continue to push into Latin America, with Colombia and Mexico seen as key markets. Singapore is its second-biggest hub, where 400 people work. Nelson said: \u201cThis complements the growth we are seeing in Dubai, China and in our more traditional markets, particularly the United States.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dong Energy is planning to create the world\u2019s largest offshore wind maintenance hub in Grimsby, creating at least 200 jobs. The Danish company said the hub would be up and running from March 2018, initially serving three east coast windfarms. Westermost Rough is already operational, while Race Bank and Hornsea Project One are under construction. The three wind farms together are expected to generate enough electricity to power 1.5m homes. The new facility at Grimsby\u2019s Royal Dock will include a marine and helicopter centre capable for around-the-clock service to offshore farms. It will be served by two new hi-tech ships which can carry a 60-strong maintenance crew and remain at sea for long periods. Brent Cheshire, Dong\u2019s UK chairman, said the investment, worth about \u00a310m, was a vote of confidence in the UK industry and would make windfarm maintenance more efficient. \u201cThis new operational hub in Grimsby will be a game-changing industry first, raising the bar for the way we serve offshore wind farms,\u201d Dong said. \u201cIt will generate direct and indirect job opportunities in the Humber region, as well as opportunities for the local supply chain,. \u201cIt represents a massive vote of confidence to the UK offshore wind industry and confirms our commitment to the Humber region, where by 2019 we expect to have invested around \u00a36bn.\u201d Cheshire said Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU had no impact on Dong\u2019s investment plans in the UK. \u201cThe Brexit vote doesn\u2019t really affect us at all and we have currently committed to 2020.

Offshore wind has a real part to play in terms of government policy and the signals are that it is very much part of the strategy.\u201d Dong, which is based in Copenhagen and employs more than 600 people in Britain, said the new hub would create about 200 jobs. The Grimsby facility will have the capacity to support other east coast windfarms planned by Dong. It will sit alongside the existing Westermost Rough maintenance centre, with the extra land to be leased from Associated British Ports. The two ships have been designed by Rolls-Royce and will be supplied by the Norwegian shipping company \u00d8stensj\u00f8 Rederi. The first ship will be delivered in late 2017.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s interest rate cut to 0.25% in August should be enough to prevent the economy from slipping into a recession, according to the most hawkish member of the central bank\u2019s interest rate-setting committee. Kristin Forbes said Britain had avoided the predicted economic shock following the vote to leave the European Union and should recover without the need for a cut in rates to nearer 0%. \u201cThe economy is experiencing some chop, but no tsunami,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe adverse winds could quickly pick up \u2013 and merit a stronger policy response. But recently they have shifted to a more favourable direction.\u201d Forbes, a member of the monetary policy since July 2014, is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and considered an expert on financial crises. She backed a cut in interest rates in August from 0.5% to 0.25% after the economy appeared to stumble after the Brexit vote, but she refused to back a \u00a360bn expansion of the bank\u2019s quantitive easing programme and moves to buy riskier corporate bonds.

      "bodyText": "The vote for Brexit has created a \u201cchallenging period of uncertainty and adjustment\u201d Bank of England policymakers have said. In a quarterly update on the health of the financial system on Thursday, the Bank\u2019s policy makers also said the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union would not be used as a way to reduce regulation on the banking sector. The Bank also conducted its annual assessment of the help-to-buy scheme, which ends its three-year course at the end of 2016, and said its closure would not lead to mortgage lending drying up or an increase in the size of deposits required to gain a home loan. The financial policy committee, chaired by the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney, focused on the risks posed by Brexit and the \u201chigh degree of political and policy uncertainty in many advanced economies\u201d. The record of the FPC meeting on 20 September shows the members regard the outlook for financial stability as challenging. It said there is a risk that borrowing costs could rise and that households will not be able to make debt repayments. Commercial property prices have fallen and transactions are at their lowest level since 2009, the FPC said, citing the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook following the Brexit vote. Amid speculation that the withdrawal from the EU will lead to a rewriting of regulations, the policymakers said they were committed \u201cto robust prudential standards in the UK financial system\u201d. \u201cThis will require a level of resilience to be maintained that is at least as great as that currently planned, which itself exceeds that required by intentional baseline standards,\u201d the FPC said. The Bank said that since the vote to leave the EU on 23 June the pound had fallen sharply and that while this would help the country\u2019s current account deficit it could lead to higher borrowing costs. \u201cThe risk remains of a fall in overseas investors\u2019 appetite to invest in the United Kingdom. Any disorderly adjustment in capital flows would be associated with tighter funding conditions for the UK real economy,\u201d the FPC said. Bond yields \u2013 in part because of the quantitative easing programme introduced after the Brexit vote \u2013 are low, which could make the market vulnerable to sharp adjustments. The Bank is looking at China - where lending growth is high compared with the size of the economy - and will say more in November when the results of stress tests on banks are published. On Sunday, international banking body the Bank for International Settlements had said that early warning of financial overheating \u2013 the gap between credit and GDP \u2013 hit 30.1 in China in the first quarter of this year. While fallout from the Brexit vote is being closely watched by Threadneedle Street, the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank said the outcome of the referendum has been largely of domestic rather than international significance. While the vote for Brexit shocked markets, the outcome was shortlived, the ECB said in its latest economic bulletin. \u201cIn the United Kingdom, uncertainty surrounding economic policy rose. The impact on other countries has been more modest, suggesting that the vote on EU membership has resulted in a regional \u2013 rather than a global \u2013 shock. Nonetheless, other factors may also be contributing to the higher levels of political and policy uncertainty seen in other countries, particularly in the United States and China,\u201d said the central bank for the 19 members of the euro. The ECB said market volatility after the Brexit vote had largely been contained, with expectations that central bankers would ease monetary policy and governments ease austerity.",

      "bodyText": "In many parts of the country, the deer hunting season has barely gotten under way. But on Capitol Hill, John Stumpf, the chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo, recently had an outsize target pinned squarely to his chest. One after another on Wednesday, the members of the Senate banking committee scored bullseyes, as they peppered Stumpf with questions, demanding explanations for Wall Street\u2019s latest banking scandal. Just why had thousands of Wells Fargo employees fraudulently opened credit and deposit accounts in customers\u2019 names, without the knowledge of those customers? Stumpf\u2019s interrogation at the hands of the bipartisan panel exposed both his personal failings and those of the bank. He failed to craft the kind of articulate and convincing responses that the senators, the bank\u2019s customers and Americans as whole had demanded. He stumbled. He fumbled. He couldn\u2019t remember details. He passed the buck; he promised to get back to the senators with information. He wasn\u2019t the kind of slick advocate for his own cause that more polished debaters like Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase, or even Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, have been when in similar plights. Nor were the senators willing to extend a helping hand. This time, a big bank had finally gone too far. It hadn\u2019t violated the trust of big institutional investors or even of homebuyers that might have over-leveraged themselves. Wells Fargo had cheated the most ordinary Americans: anyone opening a deposit account with the bank. Wells Fargo\u2019s mantra, in pushing its rank and file employees to cross-sell products, was \u201ceight is great\u201d. These workers faced pressure \u2013 up to and including threats of losing their job \u2013 to get every bank customer to sign up for eight products and services, regardless of whether they actually needed them. The Senate banking committee clearly showed that eight wasn\u2019t great. It also tore the lid off Wells Fargo\u2019s toxic culture and revealed what I\u2019ll call the eight deadly sins, as displayed by the bank and Stumpf himself. Stupidity Just what were the Wells Fargo bankers thinking when they created this kind of \u201cpressure-cooker\u201d sales environment? Even as the bank was puzzling over the cause of this fraud, Stumpf (according to Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s particularly devastating questioning) was bragging on quarterly earnings conference calls about the bank\u2019s increased success in cross-selling products to retail banking customers. Self-deception If there is one phrase that anyone watching the hearings probably became very tired of hearing Stumpf utter, it was: \u201cThe vast majority of our people did it the right way.\u201d News flash: the reason you were sitting in front of a bunch of irate senators is because several thousand people did it the wrong way. It\u2019s like hearing Delta Airlines say, on a day when four separate airplanes crash, that all the rest of their planes landed safely. When asked whether the bank had reported the events to the SEC and to investors, Stumpf noted that the $2.6m in refunds paid to holders of the fake accounts wasn\u2019t a material sum. Investors might join senators in disagreeing. Since the news of the fake accounts broke, more than $25bn has been wiped off the value of Wells Fargo\u2019s stock; shareholders have taken a 10% haircut. Obliviousness Senator David Vitter of Louisiana nailed the magnitude of this deadly sin when he asked Stumpf whether it was normal \u201cfor 1% of a business unit to be fired over fraud\u201d and for this never to be \u201cmentioned to you\u201d. Stumpf should have been chasing down just what was amiss at the retail banking operations as soon as headlines popped up in the Los Angeles Times in 2013, or as soon as the bank had to lay off employees for fraud, whichever grabbed his wavering attention first. But he appears to have been oblivious to what was happening. He mentioned talking at Wells Fargo \u201ctown hall meetings\u201d, but he clearly wasn\u2019t doing much listening. If he had, perhaps employees wouldn\u2019t have felt the need to become whistleblowers. Hubris Oh, my, Stumpf is proud of the Wells Fargo culture and its history. And how he despises those evil people who despoiled it. \u201cThey broke our code of ethics. They were dishonest.\u201d And he says he doesn\u2019t understand what motivated them. Repeatedly, senators from both sides of the aisle tried to get Stumpf to grasp the fact that there\u2019s something more significant afoot here than a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the company\u2019s culture, and that is the fact that the culture may have been designed in such a way as to betray the company\u2019s customers. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the work of 5,300 bad apples. This is the work of sowing seeds that rotted the entire orchard,\u201d said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey. \u201cYou and your senior executives created an environment in which this culture of deception and deceit thrived.\u201d Do you get it now, Mr Stumpf? Scapegoating How many bad apples were there, and how many employees felt pushed into committing fraud by their bosses and office culture? Is Stumpf treating those who were laid off as scapegoats? That\u2019s a point that many senators returned to repeatedly. \u201cThis is a combination of low wages, punishing sales quotas and a grossly misaligned compensation incentive,\u201d argued Menendez. Reminding Stumpf of his testimony that the average Wells Fargo banker earns \u201cgood money\u201d, between $30,000 and $60,000 a year, the senator asked what Mr Stumpf made in 2015. \u201c$19.5 million.\u201d \u201cNow, that\u2019s good money,\u201d Menendez replied. When asked to put himself in the shoes of someone earning only $30,000 a year, and threatened with losing their job, all that Stumpf could say, weakly, was that \u201cthe vast majority loved Wells Fargo\u201d. When asked whether he\u2019d seek out those who resigned or were fired for not meeting quotas because they behaved ethically, and compensate them, Stumpf had no reply. Greed The grand prize for stomping on Stumpf goes to Warren. Not only did she stop him in his tracks when he tried launching into his talking points, but she went straight to the heart of the matter: greed. She displayed the transcripts of quarterly earnings calls in which Stumpf had trumpeted the bank\u2019s success in boosting the number of new products and services sold to existing customers and explained why this made Wells Fargo a great investment. She demonstrated that she knew better than he did how many shares of Wells Fargo he owned \u2013 and told him, to the penny, the impact the stock\u2019s gain (in part because of its retail banking successes) had had on his wealth. \u201cYou squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions in your own pocket,\u201d she said. Had he returned a penny of his bonus, out of shame, in spite of taking responsibility? That would be a \u201cno\u201d. Doublespeak Wall Street doublespeak has reached the level of an art form, thanks to Wells Fargo and Stumpf. Warren asked, more or less rhetorically, \u201ccross-selling is shorthand for pumping up profits, isn\u2019t it?\u201d No one expected Stumpf to agree with the senator, but for him to answer, with a straight face, that \u201ccross-selling is shorthand for deepening relationships\u201d was bizarre. The hearing was littered with such moments. Perhaps Stumpf\u2019s struggles to answer the senators\u2019 questions directly and clearly were due to the fact that he\u2019s really trapped in an Orwellian banking sub-universe? Cowardice Ultimately, it\u2019s all about cowardice. For all his protestations to the contrary, Stumpf doesn\u2019t really want to take responsibility. Throughout the hearings, he answered many questions by deferring to the bank\u2019s board \u2013 even though he\u2019s not only a director but the chairman. He doesn\u2019t want to step up and take responsibility, whether because he is personally fearful, or because he dreads what that would mean for the bank. (Would it ignite a firestorm of shareholder lawsuits?) If he hadn\u2019t been fearful of taking responsibility, he would have gone to the board in late 2013 or early 2014, acknowledged that this had happened on his watch, and fallen on his sword. He didn\u2019t. Instead, he let others muddle through, didn\u2019t demand answers or solutions, and waited while it got worse. He abdicated his responsibility to shareholders and to customers, out of cowardice. So what\u2019s the punishment for these sins? Warren has a clear idea. \u201cYou should resign. You should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission,\u201d she said. Will he? That\u2019s one question to which we\u2019re all still awaiting an answer.",

      "bodyText": "Drax is the leading faller in the mid-cap index, down 4% on concerns about the outlook for the power station operator. Shares in the group - which is converting its plants to use biomass - have been volatile in recent months, gaining ground in the wake of Brexit as investors sought out defensive stocks such as utilities. But they fell back at the end of July after it warned that its full year earnings would be at the lower end of analysts\u2019 expectations. Now they are down 13.3p at 301.7p after analysts at Jefferies cut their recommendation from hold to underperform, with a 240p target price. Oliver Salvesen at Jefferies said: Following severe under-performance in 2015, Drax\u2019s share price has risen 50% in 2016. However we expect this outperformance to unwind due to headwinds in the UK power market. We see around 10% downside to current UK forward power prices due to: (i) growing renewables and interconnection capacity; (ii) weak demand; and (iii) a lower UK gas price. Drax\u2019s earnings and valuation remains sensitive to movements in UK power prices. We see downside to UK power prices which is not currently reflected in Drax\u2019s share price. We expect power prices to fall to \u00a334 a MWh by 2018, versus the current forward price of \u00a338 a MWh. A +\u00a31 a MWh move in Drax\u2019s achieved power price is +11% on 2017 EBITDA. Following the recent appreciation of the US dollar, risks related to future biomass costs have risen. Management highlighted that post 2020, Drax\u2019s biomass costs would be subject to movements in exchange rates. This is set to be a key risk going forward given the sensitivity of Drax\u2019s earnings to fuel input prices. Drax\u2019s earnings are set to become increasingly visible. A positive EU state aid decision regarding the CfD contract for the third biomass conversion is the biggest driver, but capacity market revenues and ancillary service contracts will add to earnings visibility. Despite this we believe headwinds in power generation will outweigh the increased certainty. As UK power prices recovered through the first half of 2016, Drax outperformed significantly, rising 50% year to date, versus +18% for FTSE. We believe current consensus estimates reflect a recovery in UK power prices by 2018. Our bearish assumptions leave us 30% below 2018 EBITDA consensus.",

A positive EU state aid decision regarding the CfD contract for the third biomass conversion is the biggest driver, but capacity market revenues and ancillary service contracts will add to earnings visibility. Despite this we believe headwinds in power generation will outweigh the increased certainty.</p> <p>As UK power prices recovered through the first half of 2016, Drax outperformed significantly, rising 50% year to date, versus +18% for FTSE. We believe current consensus estimates reflect a recovery in UK power prices by 2018. Our bearish assumptions leave us 30% below 2018 EBITDA consensus.</p> </blockquote>",

    "webTitle": "Why the Turnbull government's plan to issue 30-year bonds is an unnecessary risk", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government has indicated that it will start issuing 30-year government bonds. In layperson\u2019s terms, this means the government will be borrowing money for a 30-year fixed term, paying interest every six months over those 30 years to the holder of those bonds. This locks in interest payments as a part of the budget bottom line right through to 2046 and probably beyond. The government will use the revenue from those borrowings to fund the budget deficit and maturities of existing bonds. The deficit continues to hold at levels well above the levels the Coalition government inherited from the Labor party when it won the 2013 election. The decision by the government to borrow money for such an extended duration \u2013 via the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) \u2013 sits oddly with the rhetoric from Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison about their core objective of \u201cbudget repair\u201d and the goals of returning to surplus. If these objectives were genuinely part of the government\u2019s economic strategy, there would be no need to borrow money for 30 years. The current 25-year bonds are more than sufficient to cover the government\u2019s deficit requirements, especially if the projections for a return to surplus in about three years are still relevant. The AOFM, as manager of the commonwealth\u2019s debt, has as its objectives to \u201cpromote the integrity of Australian government securities (government bonds)\u201d and \u201ccost-effectively manage the risks\u201d of borrowing. It has met these goals over many decades. The AOFM has never failed in a bond tender. It markets the virtues of the Australian economy to investors, which has helped to lower the average borrowing cost of government debt. The fact that Australia\u2019s credit rating has been so favourable over many years has also helped the AOFM to meet its goals. Most other major industrialised countries issue 30-year government bonds. One reason is the level of government debt in those countries. The G7 countries have government debt levels generally between 50% and 150% of gross domestic product with an average around 90% of GDP. This requires a large borrowing program over both the short, medium and long term. Australia\u2019s level of net government debt is currently around 17% of GDP and is forecast to peak under 20% of GDP before falling within two years as the return to surplus looms. The likely borrowing program for the AOFM is forecast to shrink as the budget deficit narrows from $37bn in 2015-16 to $26bn in 2016-17, $15b in 2017-18 and to under $6bn in 2018-19. The need for a 30-year government bond is, at best, problematic. The AOFM can cover the near-term deficits by borrowing over a shorter duration. There is a risk that in issuing a 30-year bond the AOFM is borrowing money that the government will not need. If, as is increasingly likely, the budget deficit narrows as currently forecast and the surpluses in the early years of the 2020s turn out to be substantial, the government will have borrowed money that ends up sitting on deposit at the RBA, funding nothing while all the while requiring the government to pay interest. A more measured approach would be to maintain the existing borrowing profile and continue to fund the budget requirements from shorter duration borrowings. Only if the budget deficit profile deteriorates over the medium term would there be a legitimate need to consider extending the term over which the government borrows. There is no significant investor demand for 30-year Australian government bonds, something acknowledged by the AOFM. It is taking a risk by issuing 30-year bonds at a time when markets are relatively calm. It could prove to be costly. The first few bond tenders for the 30-year bond will be watched closely for the yield the government will need to pay and the extent of investor interest.

      "bodyText": "A new report into Australia\u2019s welfare system conducted for the government by PricewaterhouseCoopers contains some intriguing information that highlights just how much the aged pension will grow over the next 60 years, and actually how few people are lifetime recipients of welfare. It\u2019s a pity however, that the worthy elements of the report have been smothered with large numbers designed to shock and obfuscate. Here\u2019s a job offer you\u2019ll love. You\u2019re 25 years old, and you can have a job till you are 70 and your total lifetime income payment will be $5.7m. That\u2019s right \u2013 nearly $6m! Were you to take that offer, you would have just agreed to earn the equivalent of $50,000 a year \u2013 less than the current median income and $10,000 less than the current average annual earnings of $60,330 \u2013 until 2061. I\u2019ve granted you a 3.5% annual pay rise, but other than that your earnings are stuck. Not quite the generous offer it seemed. It highlights how silly it is to represent either income or costs in terms of total lifetime amount. It is a \u201clifetime\u201d figure that you would never use in your actual lifetime. Yet this is the computation used throughout the latest report on welfare released this week by the government. In his speech at the National Press Club on Tuesday, the Minister for Social Services, Christian Porter, noted that the report \u201cshows that we face a total estimated future lifetime welfare cost of the present Australian population of $4.8tn\u201d. He suggested, \u201cthat is a very large figure, and no doubt it will receive considerable attention\u201d. Well let\u2019s not beat around the bush. It is a dumb figure that should be shown absolutely no respect. It is there for one reason alone \u2013 because it is big and thus it sounds like we are about to drown in a mountain of welfare payments. It reminds me of The Simpsons when the students discover that Principal Skinner earns $25,000 and Bart calculates that as he is 40 years old, \u201ctimes 25 grand, Whoa! He\u2019s a millionaire!\u201d There was a time when we used budget figures over just one year, now the standard talk is \u201cover the forward estimates\u201d of four years. But just in case four-year figures aren\u2019t big enough, it seems we now need to talk of lifetime amounts. It is similar to the dopey process used in the intergenerational report released by Joe Hockey in 2015 that talked of what debt would be in 2055 if we assume the level of debt that was in place in the 2014-15 budget were to continue. But why stop at $4.8tn? $4.8trn isn\u2019t big, you know what\u2019s big? $360.5trn. That is the \u201clifetime revenue\u201d of the federal government out to 2085 (which is to when the report\u2019s projections extend), assuming an average increase of 5.9%. Does that mean we don\u2019t need to worry about welfare spending? No, but it does show how misleading are such \u201clifetime\u201d figures. The use of other odd figures that rather distorted the cost of welfare also appeared in Porter\u2019s speech. For example, he noted the $160bn social services budget was 80% of the amount of personal income tax raised. But personal income tax accounts for just under half of all government revenue. Saying that the \u201cwelfare bill\u201d is 80% of personal income tax is a bit like someone saying they spend 80% of what they earn from the first half of the week buying food and paying the rent and utility costs. And while Porter is right to note that in 2008-09 due to stimulus payments the social security budget rose above 100% of the value of personal income tax, using that tax as a parameter is a bit odd because the current 80% level is where it has been for most of the past 15 years, and where it is projected to be out to 2021: It\u2019s also worth noting that 40% of the $160bn figure is for assistance to the aged: Yet the aged pension or aged care was never referred to in his speech. Similarly, when he talked of people remaining in welfare over their lives he pointedly did not include family tax benefits, child care rebates or paid parental leave, and yet these make up 13% of the $160bn, and are a significant portion of the $4.8trn \u201clifetime\u201d result. And for all the attempts to shock with big numbers, the most surprising figure from the report is how small are the groups of concern. For example, the report notes that of the 400,000 students currently receiving study support, around 25% in any year over the next 60 years will receive some form of income welfare. That includes Newstart, the parenting payment, careers payment, disability support pension and even the aged pension. Given the report also finds that 23% of the current population is on some form of these income supports, it is not a truly shocking result. But even of this segment, the minister \u2013 perhaps unintentionally \u2013 highlighted how small are the numbers involved. He noted how 6,600 students who received a welfare payment to study between 2003 and 2011 then went onto Newstart, and that of this group, \u201cmore than 9%\u201d (so around 600) will \u201caccess income support in each year for the rest of their lives\u201d. Now it is excellent that this study has been able to identify such a specific segment of the population, but it rather smashes the silly reporting of recent days about a plethora of \u201cnew breed of bludgers\u201d who don\u2019t want to work. As I noted last week, the level of youth who are neither in education nor looking for work is at near record lows. It may be great for selling newspapers to say there is some new crisis involving \u201cgenerational addicts\u201d, but it is just wrong. It is certainly worthwhile to look for new ways to assist people in disadvantaged segments, such as those youth who are forced through circumstances to care for sick or disabled parents. But this report and how it has been sold in the media highlights that the debate remains stuck in the mire of belief that those on welfare are somehow lucky who should be required to earn it and that it is a growing \u201cproblem\u201d. It does not bode well given the assistance for such people will likely require more investment not less; the approach still very much seems to be about impact on the budget, rather than the impact on the people.",
