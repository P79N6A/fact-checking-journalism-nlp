      "bodyText": "Labour has warned that the crown representatives who are supposed to police public sector suppliers such as the failed construction company Carillion face potential conflicts of interest, as its own research showed that several hold external directorships and one is a Tory donor. A dossier produced by the party showed that the former admiral Sir Robert Walmsley, who is responsible to the taxpayer for monitoring the outsourcing multinational Serco, also sits on the board as senior independent director of two defence contractors, Ultra Electronics and Cohort plc. Daniel Green, the crown representative for the energy sector, is a Conservative donor who has given \u00a3330,000 to the party and \u00a315,000 to Theresa May\u2019s successful leadership campaign in 2016. His profile on the LinkedIn network says he is the chief executive of a private equity firm, Liquid Business. Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said such relationships amounted to \u201can astonishing conflict of interest and yet other example of the chumocracy\u201d. Some of the crown representatives, he added, \u201cturn out to be people who actually work for companies that have contracts with the government\u201d. The crown representative system was introduced under the coalition in 2011. They are supposed to work across the government on a part-time basis to act as a focal point for key companies or groups of companies that supply the public sector. When a company is in trouble or deemed high risk, a crown representative is supposed to work with that company to develop an improvement plan. The system has come into acute focus after Carillion\u2019s liquidation. Julie Scattergood, the crown representative responsible for Carillion, retired last summer and was not replaced until autumn \u2013 by which time the company had delivered profit warnings in July and September. Sean Collins, the crown representative for Vodafone and the telecoms infrastructure provider Arqiva, is a non-executive director of JT Group, providing telecoms expertise in the Channel Islands. William Priest, the representative for technology services companies IBM and DXC, is a non-executive director of Connexin, a wireless broadband company. Carillion collapsed a week ago leaving 28,000 staff facing uncertain futures as the government and private sector companies scrambled to take on its contracts. It had a \u00a3900m deficit in its pension fund at the time of collapse and it is unclear if employee pensions can be paid out in full. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, said on Sunday that the government did not know how much the closure would cost the taxpayer. When Truss was asked on ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday if it would cost \u201chundreds of millions\u201d, she said: \u201cWell, it will be a significant amount of money. It\u2019s been a serious issue.\u201d A government white paper designed to give regulators greater powers to block or place conditions on takeovers that are deemed to put pension schemes at risk is also being drawn up for publication in March. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cGovernment contracts are subject to strict procurement rules to ensure they are awarded fairly and based on competitive merit. \u201cCrown representatives are not politically appointed \u2013 they are contractors assigned to companies where they have knowledge of the relevant sector, but where there is no conflict with other concurrent roles.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyd\u2019s of London, the world\u2019s oldest insurance market, has become the latest financial firm to announce that it plans to stop investing in coal companies. Lloyd\u2019s will start to exclude coal from its investment strategy from 1 April. The definition of what is a coal company and the criteria for divestment will be set over the coming months. The firm has long been vocal about the need to battle climate change, with insurance one of the worst affected industries by hurricanes, wildfires and flooding in recent years. The insurance market decided last month to implement a coal exclusion policy as part of a responsible investment strategy for the central mutual fund that sits behind every insurance policy written by the Lloyd\u2019s market. Inga Beale, Lloyd\u2019s of London chief executive, said: \u201cThat means that in the areas of our portfolio where we can directly influence investment decisions we will avoid investing in companies that are involved mainly in coal. \u201cIs there more the insurance sector could be doing to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy by choosing sustainable or low-carbon stocks?\u201d Lloyd\u2019s does not underwrite operations directly, but offers a marketplace to almost 90 syndicates of other insurers. Lloyd\u2019s has been slower to take action than others. Other big UK and European insurance companies, including Aviva, Allianz, Axa, Legal &amp; General, SCOR, Swiss Re and Zurich, have been shifting away from coal and other fossil fuels due to concerns about climate risks. About \u00a315bn has been divested by insurers in the past two years, according to a recent report from Unfriend Coal Network, a global coalition of NGOs and campaigners including 350.org and Greenpeace. It said 15 companies \u2013 almost all in Europe \u2013 have fully or partially cut financial ties by selling holdings in coal companies and refusing to insure their operations. France\u2019s Axa was one of the first financial firms to reduce investments in coal in May 2015 and is still leading the way. It said last month it was ditching investments and ending insurance for controversial US oil pipelines. After being criticised by campaigners for applying a threshold of 50% of revenues to define coal companies, it lowered the threshold to 30%. The Church of England has gone further, pulling out of investing in companies that make more than 10% of their revenues from thermal coal or oil from tar sands. Analysis by the ClimateWise coalition of the world\u2019s biggest insurers published in December 2016 found that more frequent extreme weather events were driving up uninsured losses and making some assets uninsurable. The report concluded that the \u201cprotection gap\u201d \u2013 the difference between the costs of natural disasters and the amount insured \u2013 had quadrupled to $100bn (\u00a379bn) a year since the 1980s. Insurance companies are perhaps also mindful of the danger that they could suffer a huge loss if their investments in fossil fuel companies were rendered worthless by action on climate change, as the Bank of England warned in 2015. However, some banks are still investing in coal plants, according to research from campaign groups. Beale told the Guardian that she would be discussing the group\u2019s new investment strategy at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos this week. Climate change and what investors can do will feature prominently at the meeting of political and business leaders. Beale said: \u201cIt goes beyond climate change. The broader issue is how we clean up the planet.\u201d Investment companies and organisations divesting from coal Allianz Axa Aviva BMO Global Asset Management Church of England Generali Legal &amp; General Munich Re Natixis SCOR Storebrand Swiss Re Zurich Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "There are more beautiful towns in Switzerland than Davos but the high alps that ring the valley in which it sits are picture-postcard perfect, especially when the rising sun kisses the mountain tops at dawn. But appearances can be deceptive and the snow defences that girdle the slopes are a reminder that this is avalanche country, stunning yet fragile. This is something members of the 1% would do well to remember as they gather in for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum this week. A synchronised upturn in the global economy has dispelled the pessimism that has been around ever since the financial crisis of a decade ago. Booming stock markets mean the billionaires who will spend the next few days emoting about inequality are considerably richer than they were a year ago. Last January, the fear was that the world would never shake off the 2008 banking meltdown blues. Now there is talk of a return to the Great Moderation, the period in the late 1990s and early 2000s when growth was robust and inflation was low. Yet, the Great Moderation was always shakier than it looked at first glance, built as it was on foundations of debt, speculation, rising asset prices and a world divided between countries running trade surpluses and those deficits. As the WEF noted in its Global Risks report last week: \u201cThe global economy faces a mix of long-standing vulnerabilities and newer threats that have emerged or evolved in the years since the crisis.\u201d Talk of a new Great Moderation looks premature. The Great Fragility would be closer to the truth. Let\u2019s start with the financial markets, where new records are being set for share prices on an almost daily basis even though investors know deep down that a serious correction is coming. All recent evidence suggests that financial markets are going to get more bullish, which increases the chances of the serious correction becoming a crash. The bulls are not really interested in anything that questions their rosy view of the world: a rising US budget deficit, higher bond yields, faster than expected increases in interest rates from central banks. Why be worried about a shutdown of the US government when the International Monetary Fund is becoming more optimistic about growth in America, Japan and the eurozone? Isn\u2019t it likely that Beijing will slow down the Chinese economy without a crash? Aren\u2019t inflationary pressures so muted that central banks are under no real pressure to raise interest rates rapidly? Tax cuts are coming. All of which means share prices have only one way to go: up. We have been here before: in 2006 and early 2007. The same recklessness applies to the environment, only more so. Global leaders gave themselves a big pat on the back when they signed the Paris climate-change accord in late 2015 but the commitments won\u2019t be enough to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures even in the unlikely event that they are adhered to. The warning signs \u2013 the hottest non-El Ni\u00f1o year on record, a devastating hurricane season and the first rise in CO2 emissions in four years \u2013 are flashing red. Noting that biodiversity is being lost as mass-extinction rates rise and that air and sea pollution were posing an increasing threat to human health, the WEF made this simple but frightening comment: \u201cWe have been pushing our planet to the brink and the damage is becoming increasingly clear.\u201d There will be much talk in Davos this week of creating a carbon-free economy, but the rhetoric that doesn\u2019t really square with an estimated 1,000 flights by private jet into and out of Switzerland for the five-day event. Davos is like a giant gated community where the 1% can mingle with each other and pretend that they care about the other 99%. Life looks and feels different on the other side of the security cordon, where for many living standards have stagnated or grown only very modestly over the past decade. Mass migration and the revolt against elites suggest that the 99% are fed up waiting for the 1% to come up with a plan to make the world fairer. Business leaders will insist in Davos this week that more investment in education and training is needed so workforces are ready to face the challenge posed by artificial intelligence. There will be no suggestion that their companies could help pay for this if they stopped avoiding tax. Rallies organised by the Fight Inequality Alliance, which has brought together social movements, women\u2019s rights groups, trade unions, and NGOs from 30 countries, will be taking place this week on mountains of a different sort: mountains of garbage and the mounds gouged out of open pit mines. Mass migration is both an expression of, and a factor behind, a growing social fragility that in turn has bred distrust of politics, politicians and political institutions. In the 18 years since Bill Clinton addressed Davos \u2013 he the last US president to do so \u2013 the idea that globalisation would prove to be a unifying force has died a slow death. The world was a different place in 2000 from what it is today: that was before 9/11, before the Iraq War, before the financial crisis and before the collapse of the Doha round of trade talks. As it has become clear multilateral organisations and institutions cannot be relied upon to deliver the good life, electorates have sought protection from their own governments. From state-sponsored cyberattacks to threats of trade wars, nationalism is on the rise. So that\u2019s the Davos reality this year: economic fragility, environmental fragility, social fragility and political fragility. And it\u2019s worth remembering that when there\u2019s a threat of an avalanche, one rifle shot or even an untimely bellow can bring the whole mountain down. Why? Because Donald Trump comes to Davos on Friday.",

Yet away from the magic mountain, in an alternative universe they sometimes call the real world, we will probably learn much more about everyday lives. The pub trade \u2013 as usual led by Tim Martin, the formerly mullet-haired, proudly Brexit-supporting boss of JD Wetherspoon \u2013 is giving the City its take on current trading.

By definition, pub businesses have connections to normal people in a way Davos folk can only talk at length about. So, while the worthies and the worth-lots muse on noble topics in Switzerland (\u201chow can we make our communities more inclusive and better equipped to overcome the root causes of today\u2019s social and cultural divisions?\u201d), the pub landlords will focus on more regular concerns. Specifically for Wetherspoons, there are likely to be questions about a pending threat of curbs to airport bars, which are supposedly partly to blame for stag- and hen-night binge-drinking, as well as alcohol-fuelled air rage. (Elton John may not be raising that one with Jean-Claude Juncker at a breakout session in Klosters.) There are also the general, and inevitable, questions about what will happen in the booze trade following Brexit. Are pubs going to be able to find enough workers to pull the pints because of new immigration rules? Will the price of a burger and a pint of Ruddles be going up because tariffs are introduced on EU food? Martin is sanguine about both topics, despite widespread worries in the Remain camp. When giving evidence last month on the implications of Brexit to parliament\u2019s business select committee, the Wetherspoons founder talked about how everything would be fine, because decisions would now be in the hands of elected politicians. Immigration policy will be sensible because it will be \u201ccontrolled by MPs in this country, who we can influence\u201d, while food prices could even come down if parliament eradicated tariffs on UK food imports: \u201cFor food, morally, it is the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will increase the purchase power and the financial wellbeing of the British public\u201d (and, presumably, Wetherspoons shareholders). Still, for the record, Martin\u2019s not your stereotypical Brexiter. He\u2019s pro-immigration, has no time for Nigel Farage and \u2013 while, superficially, you might reckon he and Trump share more than a trainee hairdresser \u2013 the pub landlord has described the leader of the free world is a \u201ccomplete egocentric weirdo\u201d. Martin\u2019s stance on Brexit revolves solely around his belief that the EU is not very democratic, and a UK outside the bloc would benefit from being more so. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have democracy, you always end up with a nutter in charge,\u201d he once said, in a virtuous position that would surely cause the odd Davos eyebrow to arch.

He\u2019s pro-immigration, has no time for Nigel Farage and \u2013 while, superficially, you might reckon he and Trump share more than a trainee hairdresser \u2013 the pub landlord has described the leader of the free world is a \u201ccomplete egocentric weirdo\u201d.</p> <p>Martin\u2019s stance on Brexit revolves solely around his belief that the EU is not very democratic, and a UK outside the bloc would benefit from being more so.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have democracy, you always end up with a nutter in charge,\u201d he once said, in a virtuous position that would surely cause the odd Davos eyebrow to arch.</p> <p>Considering the star attraction there this week, that might be another Martin line unlikely to get much traction at altitude.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The collapse of Carillion, the building and outsourcing company, throws up so many questions about the state of UK business and government services it is difficult to know where to begin. Lifting the lid on Carillion\u2019s strategic plans, it is clear that the company\u2019s board mistook tactical nous for strategy. Not that there was much common sense in taking a building company and morphing it into a conglomerate that tries to meld together the management of prisons, hospitals and schools as if they were all the same. Worse, the board chased contracts without appearing to assess the risks. The suspicion must be that the directors needed to get cash in to service existing contracts that were going awry. Underbidding for contracts seems to have become necessary to bring money in at an accelerated rate. This is an age-old problem of robbing Peter (the cash from the newly acquired contract) to fund Paul (a troubled existing contract that is suffering cost overruns the provider must cover). It must be hoped that the Insolvency Service report into the firm\u2019s collapse is a no-holds-barred examination that exposes all these tactics and their effect on Carillion\u2019s finances. It should be a lesson to other businesses that underbidding for disparate contracts may give the business a lift with a temporary injection of cash, but stores up huge problems for the future. Last September, the chief executive brought in to clean up the mess left by his predecessor said in the half-yearly report: \u201cOur objective is to be a lower-risk, lower-cost, higher-quality business generating sustainable cash-backed earnings.\u201d Unfortunately he was too late and the ship was already sinking. Which brings us to the auditors who verify company accounts and supposedly provide a bulwark against the kinds of financial mismanagement that Carillion\u2019s board have been accused of. Carillion was so large and sprawling that it employed three of the four main auditing firms \u2013 KPMG, EY and Deloitte \u2013 to check on its finances. That left only PwC to take on the job of investigating the collapse for the Insolvency Service. Except that PwC recently advised the Carillion pension fund trustees about the impact of the firm going bust on the \u00a32bn final salary scheme they oversee. As the pension scheme is a prime creditor of the company, PwC has become another conflicted participant in the insolvency. Hopefully the Insolvency Service navigates the conflicts and uses its considerable powers to conduct a thorough investigation of how Carillion was managed. But few people will hold their breath. It was the Insolvency Service that examined the entrails of HBOS following the bank\u2019s collapse in 2008. HBOS was, along with Royal Bank of Scotland, offering loans on wafer-thin margins to almost anyone who wanted one. This boosted short-term profits and director\u2019s bonuses. It also made the company vulnerable to the slightest ill wind blowing through the industry. However, to everyone\u2019s dismay, the Insolvency Service\u2019s verdict, four years after the event, was that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to prosecute. The government must also take its share of the blame as Carillion\u2019s prime customer. Labour has rightly called into question the appetite for outsourcing public services and, in particular, partnership deals, whether under the banner of the private finance initiative (PFI) or other forms of \u201crisk-sharing\u201d collaboration that have tended to privatise the profits and socialise the risks. There are better ways to run public services. But Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party must address the concern, dating back 40 years, that public sector managers are in no fit state to manage large, complex infrastructure projects or even some basic services. A sea-change in how public sector managers are trained and how Whitehall departments are run needs to happen before these schemes can be brought back \u201cin-house\u201d without repeating the same mistakes Carillion has made. Black Friday was a success, but retailers are blue about winter There was good news and bad for high street retailers in the official figures for December. The bad news was that, after poor figures for December, 2017 was the worst year for retail since 2013. Last year, shops struggled against the headwinds of rising inflation and the debilitating and constant uncertainty which was brought about by the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations. December itself was down 1.5% on the previous month, confirming what most of the shop owners have already indicated was a Christmas sales period they would much prefer to forget. The good news, as every Brexiter will emphasise, is that the situation wasn\u2019t even worse. Sales growth in 2017 was still up 1.9% on the previous year, which is a better performance than many economic forecasters dared predict. Setting aside the \u201cit wasn\u2019t so bad\u201d argument and the obvious counterpoint that consumers have yet to feel the full impact of leaving the European Union, there was another possible bright spot for retailers, and that was the movement of sales to November as a result of Black Friday. Now a yearly shopping discounting event, Black Friday has helped spread the load of Christmas spending. For that, retailers ought to be grateful. Such are the fireworks around the day itself that even the clothing retailer Next, so often a discounting refusenik, joined in. It\u2019s as if a rent-free marketplace had been invented to which the world\u2019s most voracious consumers turned up. It might seem like a version of retail hell, where the only way to seal a deal is to lop 50% off the price, but in terms of bringing shops and consumers together, it is retail heaven. That said, it is an event conducted mostly online and only adds to the pain felt by the traditional high street. Finance aside, renewables will be nuclear\u2019s real foe in the future The new chief executive of EDF Energy admitted last week that it had been a \u201cmonstrous job\u201d drumming up the backing for the UK\u2019s first new nuclear power station in decades. The next nuclear plants will need to be built for a much cheaper, subsidised price of power than the generous one awarded to EDF\u2019s Hinkley Point C, Whitehall has warned. So those who undertake construction will need every possible weapon at their disposal to defeat their biggest enemy: financing. Public finance is the magic sword that some think could slay the Godzilla-sized challenge facing Japanese firm Hitachi, which wants to build a plant on the island of Anglesey. Japanese press reports recently put the capital cost of the project at \u00a319.5bn, with more than \u00a314bn to come from loans from the UK and Japanese governments. The rationale for Tokyo is clear. The big question is why the UK would want to shoulder the risk of such a huge scheme. The idea of taxpayers taking on any of the construction risk of building new nuclear plants has been political anathema for years. It has become a government mantra that the subsidy cost promised to EDF is justified because the public is not bearing the risks of building Hinkley. EDF\u2019s chief executive confirmed last week he was also talking to the government about how to finance a second plant, at Sizewell in Suffolk. But EDF said public finance was not a prerequisite for \u00a316bn Sizewell C, and it is courting institutional investors. Whoever coughs up \u2013 assuming they do \u2013 it\u2019s still unclear whether their investment will be a good one. By 2030, when Sizewell C might be under construction, there could be five times as much offshore wind capacity as there is today, according to a report this week. Renewables, battery storage and other technologies could prove to be the real monster facing nuclear.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK consultancy giant Ernst &amp; Young has been accused of \u201cunlawful, unprofessional and unethical\u201d conduct over its relationship with a Dubai firm that was allegedly involved in money laundering and buying gold from conflict zones. The claims are made in documents filed in the high court by lawyers acting for Amjad Rihan, a former partner at E&amp;Y who exposed the alleged scandal three years ago. Rihan led a team given the job of auditing the Kaloti group, which at the time commanded half of Dubai\u2019s gold refining market. His lawyers say that after blowing the whistle, Rihan was ordered by his employer to return to Dubai. He was dismissed when he refused. Kaloti required the E&amp;Y audit to prove it was responsibly sourcing its gold. An independent assurance was needed to meet the requirements of the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), a Dubai government entity, and the London Bullion Market Association, two bodies that were essential to the firm\u2019s operation. It is claimed in the court papers that Rihan\u2019s team found Kaloti had imported 5 tons of gold bars from Morocco painted silver to avoid Moroccan restrictions on gold exports, while more than $5bn worth of cash transactions processed by the firm were not reported to the Dubai authorities. About 57 tons of Sudanese gold are said to have been received without conducting proper due diligence as to whether it had come from a conflict zone. Kaloti is also alleged to have dealt with several organisations listed by the US authorities as fronts for terrorism and organised crime \u2013 including one linked to armed rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo and another in Iran that at the time was subject to US and EU trade sanctions. When Rihan\u2019s claims first surfaced, they provoked a storm in Dubai, where gold is one of the country\u2019s most important industries, worth more than $70bn a year. His decision to now sue his former employer has raised troubling questions about the role of E&amp;Y and its treatment of whistleblowers. The court documents claim that when Rihan alerted his bosses to the fact Kaloti had failed the audit, they \u201cpositively undermined his authority (including by removing him from the audit) and ostracised him within EY, treating him as a troublemaker\u201d. It is claimed E&amp;Y placed \u201cunreasonable pressure\u201d on him to return to Dubai, despite there being \u201ccredible evidence the Dubai authorities and/or other authorities in the region took serious retaliatory action against individuals who criticised them or otherwise damaged their interests\u201d. Several E&amp;Y senior staff were then drafted in to help Kaloti rewrite its compliance report for the DMCC \u201cin such a way as to suppress, conceal or distort the audit findings\u201d. References to gold bars coated with silver were removed and no mention was made of Sudan, the DRC or Iran; values put on cash transactions were removed. Rihan\u2019s lawyers say E&amp;Y \u201cfailed to make a required disclosure based on their knowledge or suspicion that Kaloti and/or some of its suppliers were engaged in money laundering\u201d, contravening the Proceeds of Crime Act. They claim E&amp;Y is guilty under the Bribery Act because it sought to gain advantages, including retaining Kaloti as a client and maintaining good relations with the Dubai authorities, by \u201cimproperly performing its functions\u201d. An E&amp;Y spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are aware of the lawsuit and deny any liability on this matter. We plan to vigorously defend any allegations made against EY.\u201d Kaloti has always denied any impropriety.",

His lawyers say that after blowing the whistle, Rihan was ordered by his employer to return to Dubai. He was dismissed when he refused.</p> <p>Kaloti required the E&amp;Y audit to prove it was responsibly sourcing its gold. An independent assurance was needed to meet the requirements of the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), a Dubai government entity, and the London Bullion Market Association, two bodies that were essential to the firm\u2019s operation.</p> <p>It is claimed in the court papers that \u200bRihan\u2019s team found Kaloti had imported 5 tons of gold bars from Morocco painted silver to avoid Moroccan restrictions on gold exports, while more than $5bn worth of cash transactions processed by the firm were not reported to the Dubai authorities. About 57 tons of Sudanese gold are said to have been received without conducting proper due diligence as to whether it had come from a conflict zone.</p> <p>Kaloti is also alleged to have dealt with several organisations listed by the US authorities as fronts for terrorism and organised crime \u2013 including one linked to armed rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo and another in Iran that at the time was subject to US and EU trade sanctions.</p> <p>When Rihan\u2019s claims first surfaced, they provoked a storm in Dubai, where gold is <a href=\"https://in.reuters.com/article/emirates-dubai-gold/gold-industry-shifts-east-as-dubai-plans-huge-refinery-spot-contract-idINKBN0DL0LJ20140505\" title=\"\">one of the country\u2019s most important industries</a>, worth more than $70bn a year. His decision to now sue his former employer has raised troubling questions about the role of E&amp;Y and its treatment of whistleblowers.</p> <p>The court documents claim that when Rihan alerted his bosses to the fact Kaloti had failed the audit, they \u201cpositively undermined his authority (including by removing him from the audit) and ostracised him within EY, treating him as a troublemaker\u201d.</p> <p>It is claimed E&amp;Y placed \u201cunreasonable pressure\u201d on him to return to Dubai, despite there being \u201ccredible evidence the Dubai authorities and/or other authorities in the region took serious retaliatory action against individuals who criticised them or otherwise damaged their interests\u201d.</p> <p>Several E&amp;Y senior staff were then drafted in to help Kaloti rewrite its compliance report for the DMCC \u201cin such a way as to suppress, conceal or distort the audit findings\u201d. References to gold bars coated with silver were removed and no mention was made of Sudan, the DRC or Iran; values put on cash transactions were removed.</p> <p>Rihan\u2019s lawyers say E&amp;Y \u201cfailed to make a required disclosure based on their knowledge or suspicion that Kaloti and/or some of its suppliers were engaged in money laundering\u201d, contravening the Proceeds of Crime Act. They claim E&amp;Y is guilty under the Bribery Act because it sought to gain advantages, including retaining Kaloti as a client and maintaining good relations with the Dubai authorities, by \u201cimproperly performing its functions\u201d.</p> <p>An E&amp;Y spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are aware of the lawsuit and deny any liability on this matter. We plan to vigorously defend any allegations made against EY.\u201d Kaloti has always denied any impropriety.</p>",
