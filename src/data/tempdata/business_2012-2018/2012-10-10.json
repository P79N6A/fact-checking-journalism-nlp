    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Germany's decision to block \u00a325bn merger came as optimism grew a deal could be struck", 
      "body": "<p>Germany blocked the proposed \u20ac35bn (\u00a325bn) merger between BAE Systems and EADS after deciding that the UK and France were getting too great a share of benefits from the deal \u2013 and Berlin was getting too little.</p> <p>According to sources close to the transaction the position of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, hardened in the 24 hours leading up to Wednesday's decision to abandon the deal, even though Paris and London had come close to a consensus that would have allowed both companies to continue with merger discussions.</p> <p>Merkel's opposition shocked all parties, coming as optimism grew that a deal could be struck. EADS said: \"No firm reason has been given for the German government's opposition.\"</p> <p>A source close to the talks said that with three days to go before the Takeover Panel's put-up-or-shut-up deadline, BAE and EADS were 90% certain that enough progress had been made to seek an extension to the deadline which would have allowed negotiations to continue. However, Merkel balked at a perceived lack of German influence in the industrial behemoth that would be created by the combination of Britain's largest defence contractor and the Franco-German owner of Airbus.</p> <p>One of the key sticking points was the plan to establish the head office of the new company at the Airbus base in Toulouse and site the defence headquarters of the company in the UK. A demand that the corporate HQ be located in Munich was lodged by Merkel's adviser in intergovernmental talks on Friday.</p> <p>\"It became clear that the German government position was not supportive,\" said the source. \"Partly, that was because the defence business was going to be based in the UK and the overall headquarters would be at Airbus in France. The German government was left saying 'what is in it for me?'\"</p> <p>Appointing a German national \u2013 EADS chief executive Tom Enders \u2013 as boss of the new company did not assuage deeper concerns about the 50,000 EADS employees in Germany. \"In the longer term there was a concern about industrial, hi-tech jobs going out of Germany, and the level of influence of that Germany would have had.\"</p> <p>BAE's chairman, Dick Olver, told the Guardian that the politics factor had always made the chances of success no greater 50/50. But, he said, the prize of creating a manufacturing powerhouse with 220,000 employees, spanning tanks to airliners, made it a gamble worth taking. \"The upside was worth the risk,\" he said.</p> <p>In the end the politics proved insurmountable. Concerns over government influence centred on the size of French and German state shareholdings in the new business. France and Germany control 22.35% each of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings and Merkel was concerned that this power would be eroded by the deal.</p> <p>The UK government, in turn, owns a golden share in BAE that allowed it to limit foreign investment in the business. France's state holding company would have emerged with a 9% shareholding in the new business \u2013 the same as Germany's \u2013 but the Merkel government was concerned that the French state might increase its stake by acquiring the 7.5% shareholding in EADS owned by French media and retail conglomerate Lagard\u00e8re.</p> <p>With 24 hours to go before the deadline to reveal the details of the deal, France and the UK were close to reaching agreement, but Germany remained opposed. \"Over the last 24 hours it seemed like the British and French government had got to a good place,\" and there were hopes that Berlin could then be persuaded to ask the Takeover Panel for an extension to its deadline of 5pm. Instead, said the person familiar with the talks, \"it became a case of having the French and British on one page and the Germans on a second page.\" The plug had to be pulled.</p> <p>In France, the finger was also being pointed at Berlin. A source close to the negotiations told French journalists: \"It didn't work because the Germans blocked it.\"</p> <p>Merkel's opposition, however, had not emerged suddenly. In a bid to keep the merger talks top-secret, BAE and EADS and their advisers had briefed the UK, French and German governments at the highest levels when they opened discussions in July. Merkel was involved from the start. A source close to EADS said the talks had been showing substantial progress, which left both sides \"surprised\" at the final outcome. \"Common sense was breaking out all over the place,\" said the source, referring to the rising hopes of a talks extension in recent days. \"But we just did not get German consent. And we still don't know why.\"</p> <p>A German government spokesman brushed off attempts to blame Germany for the collapse of the deal.

      "bodyText": "Germany blocked the proposed \u20ac35bn (\u00a325bn) merger between BAE Systems and EADS after deciding that the UK and France were getting too great a share of benefits from the deal \u2013 and Berlin was getting too little. According to sources close to the transaction the position of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, hardened in the 24 hours leading up to Wednesday's decision to abandon the deal, even though Paris and London had come close to a consensus that would have allowed both companies to continue with merger discussions. Merkel's opposition shocked all parties, coming as optimism grew that a deal could be struck. EADS said: \"No firm reason has been given for the German government's opposition.\" A source close to the talks said that with three days to go before the Takeover Panel's put-up-or-shut-up deadline, BAE and EADS were 90% certain that enough progress had been made to seek an extension to the deadline which would have allowed negotiations to continue. However, Merkel balked at a perceived lack of German influence in the industrial behemoth that would be created by the combination of Britain's largest defence contractor and the Franco-German owner of Airbus. One of the key sticking points was the plan to establish the head office of the new company at the Airbus base in Toulouse and site the defence headquarters of the company in the UK. A demand that the corporate HQ be located in Munich was lodged by Merkel's adviser in intergovernmental talks on Friday. \"It became clear that the German government position was not supportive,\" said the source. \"Partly, that was because the defence business was going to be based in the UK and the overall headquarters would be at Airbus in France. The German government was left saying 'what is in it for me?'\" Appointing a German national \u2013 EADS chief executive Tom Enders \u2013 as boss of the new company did not assuage deeper concerns about the 50,000 EADS employees in Germany. \"In the longer term there was a concern about industrial, hi-tech jobs going out of Germany, and the level of influence of that Germany would have had.\" BAE's chairman, Dick Olver, told the Guardian that the politics factor had always made the chances of success no greater 50/50. But, he said, the prize of creating a manufacturing powerhouse with 220,000 employees, spanning tanks to airliners, made it a gamble worth taking. \"The upside was worth the risk,\" he said. In the end the politics proved insurmountable. Concerns over government influence centred on the size of French and German state shareholdings in the new business. France and Germany control 22.35% each of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings and Merkel was concerned that this power would be eroded by the deal. The UK government, in turn, owns a golden share in BAE that allowed it to limit foreign investment in the business. France's state holding company would have emerged with a 9% shareholding in the new business \u2013 the same as Germany's \u2013 but the Merkel government was concerned that the French state might increase its stake by acquiring the 7.5% shareholding in EADS owned by French media and retail conglomerate Lagard\u00e8re. With 24 hours to go before the deadline to reveal the details of the deal, France and the UK were close to reaching agreement, but Germany remained opposed. \"Over the last 24 hours it seemed like the British and French government had got to a good place,\" and there were hopes that Berlin could then be persuaded to ask the Takeover Panel for an extension to its deadline of 5pm. Instead, said the person familiar with the talks, \"it became a case of having the French and British on one page and the Germans on a second page.\" The plug had to be pulled. In France, the finger was also being pointed at Berlin. A source close to the negotiations told French journalists: \"It didn't work because the Germans blocked it.\" Merkel's opposition, however, had not emerged suddenly. In a bid to keep the merger talks top-secret, BAE and EADS and their advisers had briefed the UK, French and German governments at the highest levels when they opened discussions in July. Merkel was involved from the start. A source close to EADS said the talks had been showing substantial progress, which left both sides \"surprised\" at the final outcome. \"Common sense was breaking out all over the place,\" said the source, referring to the rising hopes of a talks extension in recent days. \"But we just did not get German consent. And we still don't know why.\" A German government spokesman brushed off attempts to blame Germany for the collapse of the deal. He said the aerospace and defence group would not be affected by the merger collapse and stressed that both companies could continue to co-operate as before, including their partnership in the Typhoon eurofighter project. \"The government supports the already existent co-operation of both companies and has complete trust in the business leadership of EADS,\" Seibert said. Peter Hintze the government's co-ordinator for aerospace who has long voiced his opposition to a merger, told Spiegel Online: \"The strength of the companies lies precisely in the close cooperation between the Germans and the French.\"",

      "body": "<p>MPs are to launch an inquiry into the government's decision to pump \u00a3375bn of new money into the economy, amid growing concerns that the policy has not worked and could cause rapid inflation in future.</p> <p>Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the cross-party Treasury select committee, said they were taking action because \"some people may be worse off as a result\" of the policy, known as quantitative easing, or QE, and that it required \"careful scrutiny\".</p> <p>He added that the committee would look at the \"winners and losers\" from QE and its cost to the taxpayer.</p> <p>There is growing concern that the four tranches of QE between 2009 and this summer have not worked, that they could have caused more damage to the economy than good, and that it should not be repeated. Economists expect another \u00a350bn of QE to be announced next month.</p> <p>Business secretary Vince Cable has admitted ministers are unsure QE is working. \"Does it work, or \u2026 does it have so many negative consequences we shouldn't do it any more?\" said Cable last month.</p> <p>Pressure for the inquiry was led by Andrea Leadsom, another Tory member of the select committee and a former bank trader, who quoted the head of Standard Chartered bank saying the risks to financial stability from QE were \"unknown\".</p> <p>Leadsom said she was concerned that, because it was dominated by economists, the Bank of England had not got the best deal from spending the virtual new money, mostly on gilts, by allowing traders to raise prices ahead of its huge spending sprees, and putting some of the money into the hands of foreign banks \u2013 an issue the committee will specifically look at. Asking the bank to judge the effectiveness of the policy was \"like asking Google to investigate their activities on the internet\", said Leadsom.</p> <p>Other concerns include the impact of low interest rates on savers and pensioners; that there is no evidence banks have used the money to lend to businesses; and that, compared to the early 1990s recession, unemployment and business start-ups and failures do not seem to be noticeably better as a result of QE, said Leadsom. The cost of \"unwinding\" the policy by reselling the gilts purchased was also prompting concern about who would bear the loss and future inflation.</p> <p>\"From my position it's very hard to say QE has benefitted economic growth,\" she told a fringe meeting at the Conservative conference in Birmingham.</p> <p>Otto Thoresen, director general of the Association of British Insurers, whose members manage a quarter of UK investments, said the first \u00a3200bn round of QE in 2009 had had \"a positive effect\" but said there were question marks over the subsequent tranches last year and this year.</p> <p>He was also concerned the policy was creating a fear that early signs of economic growth were only thanks to QE.</p> <p>\"I'm certainly unsure further QE is going to help confidence, and in fact if you could stop it and see recovery begin to emerge perhaps that would have a positive effect,\" Thoresen told the same event, organised by the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank.</p> <p>Other critics have seized on a Bank of England report in September showing that the benefits of the policy were \"heavily skewed\" towards people and households that owned the most assets.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/news/2012/nr073.pdf\" title=\"\">The report also mounted a robust defence of QE</a>, addressing emerging criticisms.</p> <p>\"Without the Bank's asset purchases, most people in the UK would have been worse off,\" it said. \"Economic growth would have been lower. Unemployment would have been higher. Many more companies would have gone out of business. This would have had a significant detrimental impact on savers and pensioners along with every other group in our society. All assessments of the effect of asset purchases must be seen in that light.\"</p> <p>Supporters of QE also suggest lower interest rates have helped stop house prices from collapsing.

Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the cross-party Treasury select committee, said they were taking action because \"some people may be worse off as a result\" of the policy, known as quantitative easing, or QE, and that it required \"careful scrutiny\". He added that the committee would look at the \"winners and losers\" from QE and its cost to the taxpayer. There is growing concern that the four tranches of QE between 2009 and this summer have not worked, that they could have caused more damage to the economy than good, and that it should not be repeated. Economists expect another \u00a350bn of QE to be announced next month. Business secretary Vince Cable has admitted ministers are unsure QE is working. \"Does it work, or \u2026 does it have so many negative consequences we shouldn't do it any more?\" said Cable last month. Pressure for the inquiry was led by Andrea Leadsom, another Tory member of the select committee and a former bank trader, who quoted the head of Standard Chartered bank saying the risks to financial stability from QE were \"unknown\". Leadsom said she was concerned that, because it was dominated by economists, the Bank of England had not got the best deal from spending the virtual new money, mostly on gilts, by allowing traders to raise prices ahead of its huge spending sprees, and putting some of the money into the hands of foreign banks \u2013 an issue the committee will specifically look at. Asking the bank to judge the effectiveness of the policy was \"like asking Google to investigate their activities on the internet\", said Leadsom. Other concerns include the impact of low interest rates on savers and pensioners; that there is no evidence banks have used the money to lend to businesses; and that, compared to the early 1990s recession, unemployment and business start-ups and failures do not seem to be noticeably better as a result of QE, said Leadsom. The cost of \"unwinding\" the policy by reselling the gilts purchased was also prompting concern about who would bear the loss and future inflation. \"From my position it's very hard to say QE has benefitted economic growth,\" she told a fringe meeting at the Conservative conference in Birmingham. Otto Thoresen, director general of the Association of British Insurers, whose members manage a quarter of UK investments, said the first \u00a3200bn round of QE in 2009 had had \"a positive effect\" but said there were question marks over the subsequent tranches last year and this year. He was also concerned the policy was creating a fear that early signs of economic growth were only thanks to QE. \"I'm certainly unsure further QE is going to help confidence, and in fact if you could stop it and see recovery begin to emerge perhaps that would have a positive effect,\" Thoresen told the same event, organised by the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank. Other critics have seized on a Bank of England report in September showing that the benefits of the policy were \"heavily skewed\" towards people and households that owned the most assets. The report also mounted a robust defence of QE, addressing emerging criticisms. \"Without the Bank's asset purchases, most people in the UK would have been worse off,\" it said. \"Economic growth would have been lower. Unemployment would have been higher. Many more companies would have gone out of business. This would have had a significant detrimental impact on savers and pensioners along with every other group in our society. All assessments of the effect of asset purchases must be seen in that light.\" Supporters of QE also suggest lower interest rates have helped stop house prices from collapsing. And they reject claims that unwinding QE could create inflation, arguing inflation is a sign of growth, and if it does occur the Bank of England has other tools, namely raising interest rates, to attempt to control it. In June, the bank's governor, Sir Mervyn King, used his annual Mansion House speech to say that critics were \"too pessimistic\". A Treasury spokesman said: \"The Bank of England has published detailed analysis of the impact of QE, which concluded that it has had a significant positive impact; without QE most people in the UK would have been worse off, economic growth would be lower, and unemployment would be higher.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ireland's first offshore oilfield is a \"big moment\" for the Irish economy and will bring jobs as well as security of supply, the boss of Irish oil explorer Providence Resources has said. The company, which is drilling in every major basin off Ireland, said its Barryroe field off the Cork coast will yield more oil than expected, which could trigger an oil rush off the Republic's coastline. The company's chief executive, Tony O'Reilly Junior, the son of the Irish media magnate, believes its oil discovery could become as important to Ireland as the North Sea has been for the UK economy. At the moment, Ireland imports all of its oil. \"It's very good news for Providence shareholders and the Irish economy,\" O'Reilly told Radio 4. \"We hope this will not be a single project. From an Irish perspective, here we have no oil industry. This really heralds the beginning of that industry.\" He expects UK companies to turn their attention to the Irish Sea. There are several offshore gas fields, including Corrib off the west coast of Ireland which was discovered in 1996 but has been dogged by planning delays and protests. The country has no oil industry \u2013 apart from a refinery near Cork that Providence wants to use. Providence now estimates that 280m barrels of oil can be drilled at Barryroe. O'Reilly said the average recovery rate of 27% exceeded earlier expectations, which put the amount of oil that can be delivered from the site at 16%. This compares with an average of 38% in the North Sea. The company is in discussions with potential partners. It is seeking a \u20ac1bn (\u00a3803m) tie-up with a major oil company to deliver the oil first discovered at the site in July. The field, which is 100m deep in the water and located 50km off the south coast of Ireland, is estimated to have 1-1.6bn barrels of oil but not all of it can be drilled. The shares climbed 3.6%, or 25p, to 725p on the news. While Providence thinks it can deliver between 17% and 43% of the oil at the Barryroe site, the recovery rate for the main reservoir, Basal Wealden, is estimated at 31%. The explorer plans to drill 41 production and 22 water-injection wells which will be 600m long. Northland analyst Andrew McGeary said: \"This announcement does not disappoint but the fairly wide range indicated suggests this is a fairly early prognosis open to further refining. However, if the 31% incorporated into the initial development scenario proves accurate this would be very good news.\" The company has kicked off an engineering study. John O'Sullivan, technical director of Providence, said: \"These reservoir and dynamic modelling studies have identified significant productive potential in the Basal Wealden reservoir, which is consistent with the test and other data that we have previously announced.\"",

Speaking after the announcement, another sources said that Merkel was \"a key factor in the decision to terminate the talks\", with her objections becoming clear only over the last 24 hours. Prior to that, both companies were expecting to seek an extension to a UK Takeover Panel deadline that expired at 5pm.</p> <p>However, as alluded to by the joint statement on Wednesday afternoon, the UK and French governments also harboured concerns about the transaction to the extent that every workable solution drew an objection from one of the three governments.</p> <p>France, which controlled 15% of EADS, was unhappy with German demands for the business to have its headquarters in Munich, while Germany was concerned that France would have a bigger shareholding in the new business than the 9% stake that it was seeking. The UK, in turn, refused to allow German and French political representatives to sit on the BAE board, as would have been likely under the dual-listed structure envisaged by both companies.</p> <p>BAE and EADS said they had made significant progress in thrashing out the shape of their merged business, including the management structure, the dividend policy and cost savings.</p> <p>\"BAE Systems and EADS believe that the merger was based on sound industrial logic,\" the companies said, having argued over the last month that the deal would protect BAE from the troubled UK defence market while giving EADS access to the US military sector.</p> <p>\"It represented a unique opportunity to create a combination from two strong and successful companies greater than the sum of the parts. The merger would have produced a combined business that would have been a technology leader and a greater force for competition and growth across both the commercial aerospace and defence sectors and which would have delivered tangible benefits to all stakeholders.\"</p> <p>Ian King, the BAE chief executive, said he was \"obviously disappointed\" that an agreement could not be reached but defended BAE's prospects, which will now be the subject of intense political and City debate.</p> <p>\"We believe the merger presented a unique opportunity for BAE Systems and EADS to combine two world class and complementary businesses to create a world leading aerospace, defence and security group,\" he said. \"However, our business remains strong and financially robust. We continue to see opportunities across our platforms and services offerings and in the various international markets in which we operate. We remain committed to delivering total shareholder value and look to the future with confidence.\"</p> <p>The chief executive designate of the merged company, EADS boss Tom Enders, said: \"It is, of course, a pity we didn't succeed but I'm glad we tried. I'm sure there will be other challenges we'll tackle together in the future.\"</p> <p>Analysts said the smaller of the two businesses, BAE, now faced serious questions over its future. \"We think the pressure will be on BAE more than EADS to come up with a plan B,\" said Guy Anderson, senior principal analyst at IHS Jane's.</p> <p>\"I am not convinced that investors will put up with business as usual. BAE is not in a bad position, it is profitable with 8% profit margins, but the fact that they leapt into this merger has opened Pandora's box. It shows that they feel they are stronger with another company than not.\"</p> <p>The UK's largest trade union, Unite, said a merger would have \"protected the UK's long-term interests\" if it had been accompanied by a jobs guarantee for British employees. Ian Waddell, a Unite official, said the UK government could secure such a guarantee in future mergers or takeovers by taking an equity stake in the company. Although the British government has a \"golden share\" in the business, which can block a foreign takeover, it does not control a significant block of shares similar to France's stake in EADS.</p> <p>Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP for Wyre and Preston, who organised a petition against the deal signed by 45 MPs, said the deal should never have been promoted due to the threat of French and German political interference.</p> <p>Wallace said Wednesday's developments put the future of King and his board colleagues at risk.</p> <p>\"The BAE board should now reflect long and hard at what their strategic error could mean for the company's future.

Speaking before the deal was officially terminated, the source said: \"The fundamental problem is that Merkel does not feel comfortable with the deal, full stop.\" The source added that the German leader appeared to have deep concerns over the notion of merging a civil aerospace manufacturer with a defence group. Speaking after the announcement, another sources said that Merkel was \"a key factor in the decision to terminate the talks\", with her objections becoming clear only over the last 24 hours. Prior to that, both companies were expecting to seek an extension to a UK Takeover Panel deadline that expired at 5pm. However, as alluded to by the joint statement on Wednesday afternoon, the UK and French governments also harboured concerns about the transaction to the extent that every workable solution drew an objection from one of the three governments. France, which controlled 15% of EADS, was unhappy with German demands for the business to have its headquarters in Munich, while Germany was concerned that France would have a bigger shareholding in the new business than the 9% stake that it was seeking. The UK, in turn, refused to allow German and French political representatives to sit on the BAE board, as would have been likely under the dual-listed structure envisaged by both companies. BAE and EADS said they had made significant progress in thrashing out the shape of their merged business, including the management structure, the dividend policy and cost savings. \"BAE Systems and EADS believe that the merger was based on sound industrial logic,\" the companies said, having argued over the last month that the deal would protect BAE from the troubled UK defence market while giving EADS access to the US military sector. \"It represented a unique opportunity to create a combination from two strong and successful companies greater than the sum of the parts. The merger would have produced a combined business that would have been a technology leader and a greater force for competition and growth across both the commercial aerospace and defence sectors and which would have delivered tangible benefits to all stakeholders.\" Ian King, the BAE chief executive, said he was \"obviously disappointed\" that an agreement could not be reached but defended BAE's prospects, which will now be the subject of intense political and City debate. \"We believe the merger presented a unique opportunity for BAE Systems and EADS to combine two world class and complementary businesses to create a world leading aerospace, defence and security group,\" he said. \"However, our business remains strong and financially robust. We continue to see opportunities across our platforms and services offerings and in the various international markets in which we operate. We remain committed to delivering total shareholder value and look to the future with confidence.\" The chief executive designate of the merged company, EADS boss Tom Enders, said: \"It is, of course, a pity we didn't succeed but I'm glad we tried. I'm sure there will be other challenges we'll tackle together in the future.\" Analysts said the smaller of the two businesses, BAE, now faced serious questions over its future. \"We think the pressure will be on BAE more than EADS to come up with a plan B,\" said Guy Anderson, senior principal analyst at IHS Jane's. \"I am not convinced that investors will put up with business as usual. BAE is not in a bad position, it is profitable with 8% profit margins, but the fact that they leapt into this merger has opened Pandora's box. It shows that they feel they are stronger with another company than not.\" The UK's largest trade union, Unite, said a merger would have \"protected the UK's long-term interests\" if it had been accompanied by a jobs guarantee for British employees. Ian Waddell, a Unite official, said the UK government could secure such a guarantee in future mergers or takeovers by taking an equity stake in the company. Although the British government has a \"golden share\" in the business, which can block a foreign takeover, it does not control a significant block of shares similar to France's stake in EADS. Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP for Wyre and Preston, who organised a petition against the deal signed by 45 MPs, said the deal should never have been promoted due to the threat of French and German political interference. Wallace said Wednesday's developments put the future of King and his board colleagues at risk. \"The BAE board should now reflect long and hard at what their strategic error could mean for the company's future. If they have put at risk my constituents' jobs and fatally wounded the UK's jewel in the manufacturing crown, then they should consider their position. \"BAE and its workers is a world leader in aerospace it has a great future it does not deserve, through inconsistent and unrealistic strategy to be put at risk by such leadership.\"",

VisitBritain says the luxury clothing brand Burberry has played an almost lone hand at wooing high-spending Chinese tourists to the UK. France and Italy have aspirational consumer brands such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s, Christian Dior and Prada, the report says, while Germany's reputation is enhanced by its cars and consumer electronics. However, the only British brand with any profile in China is the 156-year-old fashion house founded by Thomas Burberry. VisitBritain's strategy to boost tourism from China focuses on promoting high-end consumer culture while dispelling the myth that the UK is home to unwelcoming monolinguists whose goods are poor value for money. It also repeats concerns that the UK's tough visa policy deters potential visitors from China, Russia, India and the United Arab Emirates. A Best-of-British delegation of retailers, tourist attractions and sports organisations including Harrods, Selfridges, the Historic Royal Palaces and the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis museum will fly to Beijing next month in the Olympics afterglow, while setting a new tone that contrasts sharply with the Cool Britannia of the Blair era, which promoted Britpop, art and edgy fashion. Also in attendance will be Value Retail, owner of Bicester Village, the designer shopping outlet in Oxfordshire, which hopes to lure wealthy visitors out of London and into the countryside. Most tourists visit only the capital. VisitBritain has set a target of 40 million foreign visitors by 2020, 9 million more than today. Tourism accounts for about 9% of GDP and jobs and is the third-largest foreign-exchange earner, behind chemicals and financial services, its report says. \"Seen from a Chinese tour bus, the continent of Europe is not so much an ancient collection of cities and nations as a glittering emporium stocked with brands,\" the report adds. \"However, Britain's retail and consumer brands fare poorly relative to their competitors.\" Language barriers are also a competitive issue, says VisitBritain. \"In France, shop assistants at the Galeries Lafayette department store speak Mandarin, while hotels with many Chinese guests provide television channels in their native language and teapots (in addition to coffee makers) in their rooms,\" the report says. \"In Britain, while some of the leading players such as the West End stores and Hilton hotels have started programmes to welcome Chinese visitors, there is still much to be done to ensure tourism businesses around the country understand the expectations of international markets.\" The highest-spending foreign holidaymakers in Britain are the Qataris, the report says, who spend an average of \u00a3215 a night over 15 nights. Kuwaitis spend about \u00a3215 a night too, but over 12 days, while Saudis spend \u00a3207 a night over 13 nights. The Chinese spend \u00a3112 a night over 13 nights; Americans stay for a week and spend \u00a3104 a night. Despite the global recession and European debt crisis, the shrinking economies of France, Germany, Spain and the US account for a third of the money spent by tourists in the UK. The number of visitors from Australia, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the UAE has increased.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's status as a safe haven for global investors is temporary and funds will return to their home markets when the eurozone recovers, IMF officials have warned. Capital flight from Spanish and Italian banks has increased demand for UK government bonds as a safe haven asset but demand is forecast to fall when these countries recover, increasing the Treasury's borrowing costs. The warning came as the IMF said in its six-monthly report on global financial stability that volatile stock markets and the dramatic flight of capital out of Spain and Italy are signals that the world economy is less stable than six months ago. The US and Japan could also see government borrowing costs rise should investors switch funds back to the eurozone or panic about their lack of action in bringing down annual government spending deficits. Officials expressed concern governments that have enjoyed safe haven status have become complacent in recent months, with low borrowing costs taking away the urgency for policymakers to make significant reforms. The IMF said eurozone policymakers have made strides to give money markets some certainty but it has proved inadequate and encouraged flights of money from the periphery to northern Europe and countries outside the currency union. Capital flight from Spanish banks totalled \u20ac296bn in the year to June 2012, which equalled 27% of the country's 2011 GDP. Italian banks also haemorrhaged funds: more than \u20ac235bn left Italy's banks to be deposited in northern European financial institutions and banks outside the eurozone, including UK banks. A scheme put forward by the European Central Bank (ECB) to buy government bonds known as outright monetary transactions (OMTs) has so far failed to entice eurozone governments, especially Spain, which is fearful of the conditions attached to the lending scheme. Spain has already rejected a bailout offered under a parallel scheme put together by Brussels, the European Stability Mechanism, saying it was unnecessary. The authors of the report, Peter Dattels and Mathew Jones, said confidence in politicians had waned as each economic initiative failed to unite policymakers. The reports authors also pointed out that Europe's banks, unlike their American counterparts, are still struggling to lend. Dattels said banks remained underfunded and under pressure from a range of concerns, including continued speculation that one or more countries will pull out of the euro. \"Despite significant and continuing efforts of European policymakers, which have been essential in addressing investors' biggest fears, the principal risk remains the euro area crisis,\" they said. \"Incremental policymaking has been insufficient to fully allay market tensions despite the recent market rally since the end of July.\" They said problems in the US and Japan could be tackled over the next few years while it was a priority to agree a way forward for the eurozone in the next months. A gulf between rich and poorer nations inside the eurozone was making the situation worse. Even with moves to closer co-operation between eurozone countries, banks in the periphery could be forced to reduced their lending by as much as \u20ac2.8tn, higher than the previous estimate of \u20ac2.6tn in April. A do-nothing policy would lead to a reduction in lending of \u20ac4.5tn. The Washington-based organisation has warned before that the world economy is under threat from an unstable financial system all the time eurozone leaders fail to agree terms for bailouts and monetary easing. ECB boss Mario Draghi has garnered praise for his efforts to protect weaker eurozone countries in case they come under attack from nervous investors. Spain, Italy and Portugal have enjoyed lower interest rates as a result of the ECB's actions that cut borrowing costs. These moves have helped stave off a run on the currency. But Draghi has come under constant fire from politicians in Germany, Finland and Holland for creating unlimited rescue funds that could, they believe, rebound on the ECB. This week the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said he believed Spain would survive with rescue funds from Brussels, contradicting most investor groups and City analysts who believe Spain can only survive if it accepts support from the EU. The IMF's global stability report argues that badly indebted countries need more support to alleviate the pressure from investors and create an environment that fosters confidence and growth. It says that while decisions are delayed the assets held by banks come under question and shareholders flee to hold safer assets. Banks in the eurozone periphery are known to hold billions of euros of bad debts that have yet to be recognised on their balance sheets. UK, French and German banks are also vulnerable to a downturn in the eurozone through their shareholdings and joint ventures with local banks in the periphery.",
