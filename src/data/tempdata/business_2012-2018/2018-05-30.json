      "bodyText": "The government has sought to win the fight over its proposed tax cuts by suggesting it is really a tax cut for middle income earners. But despite assistance from some pretty dire reporting, Treasury\u2019s own figures highlight just how greatly the tax cut is weighted towards high-income earners and those earning far more than the incomes of middle Australia. Before the budget I wrote that the government would likely attempt to sell its budget by misleadingly referring to average income earners as middle Australia. But even I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be at the point where someone on $200,000 would be considered middle income. \u201cAverage\u201d sounds like it is the middle \u2013 an \u201caverage Australian\u201d sounds like someone who is typical of Australians and \u201caverage income\u201d sounds like a typical income. It is why, for example, Malcolm Turnbull in question time on Wednesday referred to his tax plan by saying it would help \u201cmiddle income earners\u201d and that \u201cmiddle Australia will benefit from this\u201d. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday But average earnings \u2013 especially average full-time earnings \u2013 are not what is earned by \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d. Always remember \u2013 average full-time earnings are higher than average earnings, and average earnings are higher than median earnings. Current average full-time annual earnings are $81,531, but median annual earnings for a full-time worker are just $65,577: The median income for all workers \u2013 that is, the amount at which half earn more and half earn less \u2013 is just $52,988. And yet last week in the Australian we were told that \u201cTurnbull\u2019s tax plan will target the middle class\u201d and that \u201cthe bulk of the tax benefit received would come from abolishing the 37% tax bracket and would go almost entirely to middle-income earners on wages of $120,000 to $200,000\u201d. Please. The Australian suggested this was the case because of \u201cTreasury analysis of wage data\u201d that shows someone on an income of $120,000 in 2024-25 \u201cwould be considered the average wage equivalent to $84,600 in today\u2019s terms\u201d and that \u201ca salary of $158,730 in 2017-18 would be $200,000 in 2024-25\u201d. This would happen if wages grew by 3.5% each year after 2020-21. That is absurd enough, but there is no reality in which an Australian worker on $120,000, let alone $200,000, can be classed as a middle-income earner. It is utterly misleading to suggest that someone on $84,600 is middle-income \u2013 let alone someone on $158,730. We know from the most recent taxation statistics that someone with a taxable income of $84,000 puts them in the top 25% and someone earning $158,000 is in the top 5%: The AFR also got in on this absurdity, suggesting \u201cwage rises will make $200k a middle income\u201d and that \u201cthe chief beneficiaries of the third stage of the government\u2019s income tax cuts will be earning up to $200,000 but they will be classified as middle-income earners by the time the cuts are delivered\u201d. We\u2019ve reached a pretty awful place where someone earning nearly twice as much as the average full-time wage and three times the median wage is being called \u201cmiddle-income\u201d. To be fair, someone on the actual median income of $52,988 will one day earn $200,000 \u2013 in 2056-57. And at that time, the AFR\u2019s version of the median-income earner will be on $615,875: On Wednesday the pitch was changed to refer to workers such as police officers and teachers (occupations conservative media governments always love, except when they are conducting industrial action to get a pay rise) and bizarrely a \u201cforklift driver\u201d. The Australian suggested that a \u201cforklift driver/excavator would pay almost $4,000 more a year in tax under Labor on a salary estimated at the most qualified level to be $164,331 in 2024-25\u201d. Such a salary would be news to most forklift drivers. In the latest tax statistics, the median income for forklift drivers in 2015-16 was $48,622, and for an excavator operator the median income in 2015-16 was just $63,300. On the Australian\u2019s list of presumably middle-income earners was \u201cschool principal from the ACT\u201d. In 2015-16 those principals had a median income of $131,692 \u2013 putting them in the top 8% all of taxpayers. The government needs to push this line, of course, because those on the actual median income will not get to $120,000 until 2041-42 (assuming that wonderful 3.5% wage growth!). On Tuesday the Treasury released new data during a Senate estimates hearing that tried to suggest the benefits of the tax plan would go to middle income earners. But it only serves to reinforce how much the plan benefits higher income earners and how the cost of those high income tax cuts dwarfs the rest. By 2024-25, once the entire set of tax cuts go through, those on $200,000 would receive a tax cut of 3.6%, compared with what they pay now, whereas those on $70,000 (which will be the median income by then) get a cut of just 0.8%: The tax cut is actually awful for \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d. Median income earners get a smaller tax cut than low-income earners and a very much smaller one than high-income earners. And then we get to the cost \u2013 which is now up to $144bn out to the end 2028-29. The biggest cost to the budget over that time is the $41bn to raise the 19% threshold to $41,000. But that is planned to be done in 2022, and thus its cost covers seven years. The $33bn spent to remove the 32.5% tax bracket occurs over just five years \u2013 meaning on average it will cost the budget $6.6bn a year: From 2024-25 all the tax cuts combined will reduce revenue by an average of $21.8bn a year, but $13.5bn \u2013 or 62% \u2013 of that is for tax cuts overwhelmingly for those earning over $120,000. And how will the government pay for that $22bn cut to revenue? This is the problem with misleading talk about who benefits, because when it comes to paying for it, you can bet the ones who will feel the effects of reduced services will be those who actually are part of middle Australia. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

That is according to executives at the UK\u2019s biggest firms, who have offered the excuses to explain why their boardrooms are dominated by men. The business minister Andrew Griffiths, responding to a report released by the his department on Wednesday, described the comments as \u201cpitiful and patronising\u201d as he sought to highlight how far FTSE 350 companies have to go on diversity at the top level. According to the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, the excuses given included: \u201cI don\u2019t think women fit comfortably into the board environment\u201d \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many women with the right credentials and depth of experience to sit on the board - the issues covered are extremely complex\u201d \u201cMost women don\u2019t want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board\u201d \u201cShareholders just aren\u2019t interested in the make-up of the board, so why should we be?\u201d \u201cMy other board colleagues wouldn\u2019t want to appoint a woman on our board\u201d \u201cAll the \u2018good\u2019 women have already been snapped up\u201d \u201cWe have one woman already on the board, so we are done - it is someone else\u2019s turn\u201d \u201cThere aren\u2019t any vacancies at the moment - if there were I would think about appointing a woman\u201d \u201cWe need to build the pipeline from the bottom - there just aren\u2019t enough senior women in this sector\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t just appoint a woman because I want to\u201d Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of Business in the Community, an organisation that champions corporate social responsibility, said: \u201cAs you read this list of excuses, you might think it\u2019s 1918, not 2018. It reads like a script from a comedy parody, but it\u2019s true. Surely we can now tackle this once and for all. Maybe those that give credence to these excuses are the ones that are not up to sitting on boards and should move over: we are in the 21st century after all.\u201d The independent Hampton-Alexander review is being led by Sir Philip Hampton, one of Britain\u2019s most highly regarded bosses, who has challenged all FTSE 350 companies to make sure at least a third of their board members and leadership are women by 2020. He said excuses such as those highlighted in the government report were heard less now than a few years ago. \u201cHowever, leaders expressing warm words of support but actually doing very little to appoint women into top jobs \u2013 or quietly blocking progress \u2013 are really not much better.\u201d The Department for Business said there had been some more tangible progress in recent years, with the number of women on boards having \u201cmore than doubled in the FTSE 350 since 2011\u201d, according to the most recent statistics \u2013 released in November last year. \u201cIn that time, the number of all-male FTSE 350 company boards also fell from 152 to 10,\u201d it said. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 May 2018.

That is according to executives at the UK\u2019s biggest firms, who have offered the excuses to explain why their boardrooms are dominated by men.</p> \n<p>The business minister Andrew Griffiths, responding to a report released by the his department on Wednesday, described the comments as \u201cpitiful and patronising\u201d as he sought to highlight how far FTSE 350 companies have to go on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/diversity\">diversity</a> at the top level.</p> \n<p>According to the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, the excuses given included:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> \u201cI don\u2019t think women fit comfortably into the board environment\u201d <br></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many women with the right credentials and depth of experience to sit on the board - the issues covered are extremely complex\u201d<br></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>\u201cMost women don\u2019t want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board\u201d<br></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>\u201cShareholders just aren\u2019t interested in the make-up of the board, so why should we be?\u201d<br></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>\u201cMy other board colleagues wouldn\u2019t want to appoint a woman on our board\u201d<br></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>\u201cAll the \u2018good\u2019 women have already been snapped up\u201d<br></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>\u201cWe have one woman already on the board, so we are done - it is someone else\u2019s turn\u201d<br></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any vacancies at the moment - if there were I would think about appointing a woman\u201d<br></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>\u201cWe need to build the pipeline from the bottom - there just aren\u2019t enough senior women in this sector\u201d<br></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>\u201cI can\u2019t just appoint a woman because I want to\u201d</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of Business in the Community, an organisation that champions corporate social responsibility, said: \u201cAs you read this list of excuses, you might think it\u2019s 1918, not 2018. It reads like a script from a comedy parody, but it\u2019s true. Surely we can now tackle this once and for all.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland directors have faced angry questioning from shareholders over planned branch closures and the bank\u2019s treatment of small businesses \u2013 and the bank\u2019s finance chief has warned that now may not the best time for the government to restart sales of the taxpayers\u2019 71% stake in the lender. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in Edinburgh, Ewen Stevenson \u2013 who also unexpectedly announced that he is quitting RBS \u2013 said recent stockmarket jitters meant that an immediate sale may not be the best timing. \u201cObviously when you look at what\u2019s been happening in the markets in the last few days, with Spain and Italy and a significant sell-off in bank stocks, I would be surprised if now is an optimum time to sell stocks,\u201d Stevenson said. The government is hoping to sell \u00a315bn worth of shares by 2023, around two-thirds of its stake, and reports have suggested that a sale of 10% of the bank\u2019s shares could be imminent. The final obstacle to a sell-off was removed earlier this month when the bank reached a $4.9bn settlement with US authorities related to selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis a decade ago. However, Stevenson also revealed that the government was unlikely to let the bank know its intentions. \u201cLast time they gave [chief executive] Ross [McEwan] a call out of courtesy a few minutes before they were due to start selling.\u201d McEwan apologised in his opening remarks for the way the bank\u2019s Global Restructuring Group had treated small businesses seeking help in the wake of the global financial crisis. A report commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority and finally released in February detailed \u201cdisgraceful\u201d practices at GRG. One shareholder, Neil Mitchell, described how small firms were \u201ctargeted and destroyed\u201d and told the board that he was aware of multiple suicides that he believed had been directly caused by the bank. In the wood-panelled conference hall of the RBS head office \u2013 designed by the bank\u2019s disgraced former boss Fred Goodwin \u2013 McEwan insisted: \u201cAny financial services business must always hold two things \u2013 its financial strength and its reputation. We lost both of these \u2013 we fell the furthest \u2013 but we have also changed the most. We are a different bank now.\u201d A decade on from the bank\u2019s taxpayer \u00a345bn bailout, the chairman, Howard Davies, lauded a \u201clandmark year\u201d for the bank. RBS made a \u00a3750m profit last year \u2013 after nine years of huge losses. However, there were a number of heated interventions from shareholders. One eventually had the microphone removed as he continued to argue his case for greater accountability. The meeting also rejected the setting up of a shareholder committee that would give investors power over the pay levels of senior executives. A number of shareholders argued from the floor that such a committee could avoid a repeat of the \u201clack of integrity and fleecing of customers\u201d that led to the 2008 bailout. The bank\u2019s board had urged the proposal be rejected and the government voted its stake against, even though it has previously supported such moves. Representatives from rural Scotland described the plan for branch closures as \u201cripping the heart out of local communities\u201d. A protest outside the conference hall, organised by Unite, called on the bank to reconsider its decision to close 62 branches in Scotland. The House of Commons Scottish affairs committee has described the plan as \u201ca devastating blow to the affected communities\u201d. Another 162 closures are planned in England and Wales. Community councillor and former RBS employee Alastair Forsyth, who had travelled from Aberdeen to join the protest, pointed out that the move to digital banking was not easy for those living in rural areas with limited broadband access. McEwan insisted RBS had to respond to changing customer trends and that all growth in payment volumes comes from digital platforms. Shareholder Peter de Vink expressed his disappointment that Goodwin had not faced legal action last year \u2013 which the bank avoided when it settled a legal row with shareholders who had supported a cash call in the months before its near collapse. He accused RBS of paying \u00a31bn to spare its former CEO that embarrassment.",

      "bodyText": "MPs and rail passenger groups are demanding emergency measures from the Department for Transport to end the travel chaos on Govia Thameslink services in and out of London over the last 10 days. Since the new timetable was introduced on 20 May, commuters trying to use the supposedly upgraded network have experienced mass last-minute cancellations, long delays and severely overcrowded services. Similar problems have been endured by passengers using Northern services in the north of England. The problems have led to renewed calls for the train network to be nationalised. A lack of trains and properly trained drivers has been blamed for the chaos, which has affected almost every part of the Govia-run network \u2013 the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern, and Gatwick Express franchises. Collectively they account for around 20% of all UK train services. Each day has brought more disruption around London and increasing anger at the lack of information. Govia\u2019s senior staff have been largely invisible, as have government ministers. Passengers are furious because in many cases, and contrary to claims by ministers, the timetable change has left them with fewer trains and longer journey times. A petition urging the government to immediately cancel Govia Thameslink Railway\u2019s contract had attracted nearly 4,000 signatures by Wednesday afternoon, 24 hours after it was launched. Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP for Reigate, said the situation was an \u201cemergency which needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency\u201d. Blunt added: \u201cIt is clear that neither GTR [Govia Thameslink] nor Network Rail were sufficiently resourced or funded to manage such a huge operation. \u201cThe result has been a catastrophic number of cancellations and services being simply withdrawn from the daily timetable \u2026 Government cannot just sit back and let this happen.\u201d Edward Carder, who leads the Royston &amp; Villages Rail Users Group, said the last 10 days had been \u201cutterly shambolic\u201d, with this week\u2019s service worse than last. \u201cIt is impossible to know even 15 minutes ahead whether a particular train will run. \u201cThe Department for Transport need to force Govia to publish the timetable at least 24 hours ahead and then force the company to stick to it. \u201cWe have had heartbreaking stories of children scrambling to get to GCSE exams in a panic and lost hospital appointments due to missed trains. It is essentially impossible to conduct your life in reliance on the trains at present, the service is broken.\u201d The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has written to the affected MPs blaming the problems on Network Rail. He has said he is \u201cmonitoring\u201d the situation. \u201cThe disruption suffered by passengers is wholly unacceptable. I have been very clear with Network Rail that it was far too late in finalising planned timetable changes and this must not happen again,\u201d Grayling said. A GTR spokesman said: \u201cWe apologise to passengers for the continued disruption linked to the introduction of the new timetable. We are working on a recovery plan with rail industry partners.\u201d Network Rail said late timetables have not helped the recent events but there were many other factors involved. This article was amended on 1 June 2018 to make it clear that affected Northern rail services operate only in the north of England, not Scotland, which is served by the operator ScotRail.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After Tuesday\u2019s sharp falls in the wake of the Italian political crisis, most European markets tried their best to regain some of the lost ground. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is currently up 1.7%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.7% higher, Spain\u2019s Ibex has added 0.4% and the FTSE 100 is up 0.14%. But France\u2019s Cac remains in negative territory, down 0.27%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 170 points or 0.7%. The euro managed to gain 0.9% to $1.1641, recovering all of Tuesday\u2019s losses, before slipping back to $1.1625. The recovery came despite continuing confusion about the outlook for Italy, with reports suggesting that the 5 Star and Lega parties were attempting to revive their coalition plans. But there is still the prospect of further elections later this year to add to the uncertainty. And the European Central Bank may call an urgent meeting to discuss the situation in Italy, according to sources. Meanwhile an Italian bond auction succeeded, but at the cost of the highest interest rate since May 2014. Over in Spain, prime minister Rajoy was resisting calls for him to step down, as he prepares to face a no confidence vote on Friday. On the economic front, German inflation came in stronger than expected, adding to the problems facing the European Central Bank. Eurozone economic sentiment slipped slightly in May. In the US there were disappointing jobs and economic growth figures. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The European recovery may in some cases be a little tentative, but the Wall Street rally looks a little more substantial. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 160 points or 0.66% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.47% and the Nasdaq Composite is 0.43% higher. Another piece of US data to keep away from the president. US GDP grew by less than initially thought in the first quarter. On an annualised basis the economy grew by 2.2%, down from the first estimate of 2.3% and much lower than the fourth quarter\u2019s growth rate of 2.9%. But economists expect that Trump\u2019s $1.5bn of tax cuts could boost growth in the second quarter, closer to the president\u2019s 3% target. Don\u2019t tell Donald Trump, but the latest US private payroll figures have fallen short of forecasts. Ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls, the ADP employment report shows an increase of 178,000 private sector jobs in May, compared to expectations of a 190,000 rise. On top of that, the April number was revised down from 204,000 to 163,000. The surge in German inflation complicates the European Central Bank\u2019s life even further, says ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski: While the Easter Bunny Effect has finally been left behind, German inflation is still heavily affected by seasonal effects. The sharp surge in oil prices in combination with several public holidays and long weekends pushed up energy prices, leisure costs and food prices. Under the surface of (too) many one-off factors, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication and clothing. Where available, core inflation measures at the state levels actually dropped in May. Despite today\u2019s increase in headline inflation, the underlying trend still points to a rather benign picture for inflationary pressure. For the ECB, however, today\u2019s inflation data from Germany gives a foretaste of the increased complications on the road to taper. The still undecided debate on whether the Eurozone economy is in a soft patch or at the start of a protracted downswing, the surge in oil prices and latest political developments in Italy have clearly complicated the ECB\u2019s life. It increasingly looks as if the big question for the ECB is not when to stop QE but rather when to signal an extension of QE. With latest market turmoil and political tensions in Italy, giving some certainty in times of uncertainty could be the ECB\u2019s preferred policy choice. This would be an announcement or at least a very clear hint at QE extension at the June meeting. The cost of buying goods and services in Germany has soared above the European Central Banks target of 2%, according to official figures. Consumer price inflation jumped from 1.4% year on year in April to 2.2% in May, the fastest pace since February 2017 and well above forecasts of a 1.8% rise. The month on month increase was 0.6%, compared to expectations of a figure of 0.3%. The biggest rises were in energy and food prices. The figures strengthens the hand of the Bundesbank, which would prefer the ECB to end its QE programme this year and begin raising interest rates, partly to benefit German savers. Here\u2019s our latest report on the day\u2019s political developments in Italy: The head of Italy\u2019s anti-establishment Five Star Movement has rekindled negotiations to form a government, days after a bitter row over the country\u2019s future in the eurozone ended a fledgling deal for populist parties to take power. Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old head of the M5S, Italy\u2019s largest party, indicated on Wednesday he was prepared to compromise on his controversial choice of a eurosceptic economist, Paolo Savona, for finance minister. But he insisted that his pick for prime minister remained political newcomer Giuseppe Conte. In the absence of an agreement between Di Maio , the president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, and the far right leader Matteo Salvini, Di Maio said he favoured snap elections. \u201cThere are two paths ahead. Either we launch the Conte government with a reasonable solution or we vote right away,\u201d he said. Italian markets, which have been hit hard by the political crisis, rallied on the news of a potential new deal, which would at least temporarily put plans for a new election on hold. The full story is here: Despite many markets edging higher, they are nowhere near recovering the Italy-driven losses, and investors have very little appetite for risk at the moment. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: It looked as though we were headed for fresh elections as early as July, with negotiations between Five Star Movement and Lega having failed after President Sergio Mattarella vetoed their choice of Finance Minister. Carlo Cottarelli \u2013 a former IMF economist - was tasked with forming a temporary government until further elections are called, ideally next year, but that appears to have failed before it got started. While early elections will arguably be very beneficial to the populist parties, who will cite the rejection of its choice of Finance Minister as evidence of Brussels interference and an abuse of the democratic will of the people, it seems one last attempt to form a government is being discussed. The parties seem unwilling to hold an election in July and have no desire to wait until next year. If a government can be formed that receives the stamp of approval from Mattarella and is therefore seen as not posing a threat to Italy\u2019s place in the eurozone, then this will come as a relief to markets in the near-term. Longer-term risks remain though and both parties will likely use recent events as a platform to drum up opposition to the euro with the end goal of holding its own referendum, something eurozone leaders will understandably fear after the UK result in 2016. Over in Spain, prime minister Rajoy is resisting the idea of stepping down as he prepares to face Friday\u2019s no confidence vote: Don\u2019t panic, suggests Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management: Everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down. Only then can we talk about Italy. 1) Bond market moves do not break up monetary unions. Bank runs do. There is no evidence of bank runs. 2) Neither Italian parties nor Italian voters support leaving the Euro. 3) The anti-party coalition was not expected to last, because of policy disagreements. It is not certain that the two anti-parties would try to form a government after elections. Markets have moved anyway. We are now in that phase where any trader who overheard a conversation in their local Domino\u2019s Pizza takeaway considers themselves an expert on Italian politics. Investors would be wise to treat recent market moves with caution. The Lega party reportedly wants new elections in Italy as soon as possible. Reuters says: Italy\u2019s far-right League party will not block rapid political solutions that would allow the country to handle possible emergencies, but it wants an election as soon as possible, a source from the party said on Wednesday. \u201cAt this point, we will not block rapid solutions capable of managing emergencies, but we must let Italians express themselves again as soon as possible,\u201d the source said. The source did not explain what was meant by \u201cemergencies\u201d, though financial markets have been in turmoil over the continuing political uncertainty. Europe is likely to muddle through the current political uncertainty, says Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management: Without a swift political solution to the situation in Italy, we believe that the risk-return trade-off for European assets has deteriorated. As things currently stand, we are likely to see a period of heightened volatility in Italian and broader European equities and bonds amid Italian political dynamics and their interactions with ECB policy. That said, we do not see Italian political developments as presenting material systemic risks beyond Europe at this stage. Both populist parties have signalled they will not attempt to leave the Eurozone (and according to the Italian Constitution this would be extremely difficult in any case), even if their desired fiscal policies put them on a collision course with the core of Europe and the ECB. We ultimately expect market and political pressures to constrain these parties, and Europe will find a way to muddle through political uncertainty as it has in the past. Still, we recognize the path to resolution is likely to be bumpy and have downgraded our outlook on European assets to account for recent developments. The Italian bond auction results are in, and it seems to have been a reasonable success although the interest rate is again a high one: The dip in the eurozone sentiment figures shows that even before the Italian turmoil, confidence was not really recovering, says Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING Bank: Much like fidget spinners, euphoria about Eurozone growth and politics is definitely something that stayed in 2017. A few months ago, the sky was the limit for Eurozone sentiment, but now even stabilisation seems like a good result, as analysts expected worse. Given that the survey does not account for the Italian turmoil, it\u2019s safe to say that moderating growth continues to be the message of 2018. While a few one-offs impacted the disappointing first quarter growth rate of 0.4%, it seems that there is some more permanence to the slower growth than initially expected even though Eurozone fundamentals remain strong with labour market strength and a favourable investment environment. The months ahead will likely see uncertainty continue as the Italian political crisis could drag on during the summer. As developments towards a new government continue, uncertainty about the Italian stance towards the EU and the euro will prevail. Even though it is very unclear what the next steps will be, markets have clearly woken up from the euro-risk lull that started after the Macron presidential election victory in France last year. This continued uncertainty will weigh on Eurozone growth in the months ahead, and a bounce back to growth rates seen in 2017 seems very difficult. Economic confidence in the eurozone dipped slightly in May, according the European Commission. The economic sentiment index slipped by 0.2 points to 112.5 in the eurozone, but edged up 0.4 points to 112.8 in the wider EU. Consumer confidence in the eurozone was down from 0.3 to 0.2. The commission said: Virtually unchanged consumer confidence (-0.1) was the result of a marked decrease in consumers\u2019 assessment of the future general economic situation, which was counterbalanced by a strong increase in their savings expectations. Views on households\u2019 future financial situation and unemployment remained broadly stable. Meanwhile in Spain, ahead of the no confidence vote facing prime minister Mariano Rajoy: The European Central Bank may call an emergency meeting to discuss Italy sometime this week. \u201cMario Draghi is obviously following events very closely and will likely call an urgent meeting imminently,\u201d said a source close to a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council. On Tuesday Bank of Italy governor Ignazio Visco warned that the crisis-stricken country is at \u201cvery serious risk of losing the irreplaceable asset of trust.\u201d Here\u2019s the OECD\u2019s latest economic outlook: Unemployment will drop to its lowest level since 1980 across the world\u2019s richest nations, but global growth remains dependent on cheap borrowing and government spending, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) has warned in its latest global economy health check. The rise of tit-for-tat protectionist trade barriers, the return of volatile financial markets, and soaring oil prices also spell trouble for the global economy as it heads towards the 10-year anniversary of the 2008 banking collapse, the OECD said. \u201cThe economic expansion is set to continue for the coming two years, and the short-term growth outlook is more favourable than it has been for many years,\u201d said Angel Gurr\u00eda, secretary general of the OECD, the Paris based thinktank for the world\u2019s 35 richest nations, including the US, Britain, Brazil, Mexico and Russia. \u201cHowever, the current recovery is still being supported by very accommodative monetary policy, and increasingly by fiscal easing. This suggests that strong, self-sustaining growth has not yet been attained.\u201d The full story is here: More reports from Italy on its political future, suggesting a new coalition may not happen: Away from Italy for the moment, and some good news on the jobs front from Germany. The jobless total fell by a better than expected 11,000 in May to 2.358m. Analysts had been forecasting a drop of 10,000. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2%, down from 5.3% and the lowest since the reunification of West and East Germany in 1990. Head of the Federal Labour Office Detlef Scheele said: \u201cThe upward trend on the labour market is continuing, albeit at a slower pace than in the winter months.\u201d As for the euro, it has made a slight recovery along with the Italian stock market, up around 0.5% at $1.1603. Senior finance officials in Greece are watching events in Italy increasingly nervously, reports Helena Smith in Athens. Exiled from capital markets for the best part of the last decade, the debt-stricken country is aiming to return to them once its third - and last - EU-IMF funded rescue programme officially expires in August. \u201cWhat is happening in Italy worries us immensely,\u201d a senior banking source told the Guardian. \u201cThe bond markets have gone mad in southern Europe. With such yields it is totally prohibitive that Greece could return to them when the programme ends.\u201d Any prospect of Athens making a \u2018 clean break\u2019 and assuming post-bailout \u2018normality\u2019 without outside assistance has also been quashed by the Italian turmoil, well-placed officials say. The Governor of the Bank of Greece Yiannis Stournaras has long argued that Greece will need a precautionary credit line \u201cas a protective cushion\u201d to see it through as it endeavours to stand on its feet after its worst financial crisis in modern times. Athens\u2019 leftist-led government, keen to break free of international oversight, has dispelled any such notion. But another senior official said: \u201cThe country will need some sort of fall-back, even if to never uses it. The government\u2019s narrative of clean breaks, and going it alone, is over for now.\u201d Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite an eye-watering drop in the Asian session, prompted by duel macro-downers of a new set of US tariffs on Chinese goods and the whiff of eurosceptic Greek tragedy around Italy\u2019s political pile-up, the European indices avoided anything too ugly after the bell.... The DAX is up 0.2%, and is trying its best to re-cross 12700 having briefly fallen below 12600 \u2013 a one month low \u2013 on Tuesday, with the CAC flat at 5390. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was actually the most upbeat... as investors cling onto hopes that this whole situation can avoid the kind of prolonged, and costly, crisis that engulfed Greece a few years ago. As for the FTSE, it showed no signs of bouncing back this Wednesday. Dipping 0.1%, the UK index is just about holding above 7600, and is back at levels not seen since for 3 weeks. With little else on its agenda, the FTSE will be hoping that things don\u2019t take another downturn in the Eurozone (or, indeed, the US). The report that 5 Star and the Lega party are attempting to revive their coalition seems to be one of the reasons behind a slight recovery in the Italian market. The FTSE MIB is currently up 0.77% but could go higher: Italy is issuing new bonds this morning, which will give another indication as to how investors feel about the current situation. On Tuesday it succeeded with a smaller issue, but at much higher interest rates. As investors await the latest political developments in Italy, European markets seem to have shrugged off the heavy falls on Wall Street and in Asia. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up around 1.3% in early trading, with the country\u2019s banking index around 2% better. Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 0.4%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.2% better but France\u2019s Cac is down 0.3%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has dipped 0.1% or 8 points. That is not to say the situation in Italy is any less confusing: On the other hand: And the controversial finance minister appointee - vetoed by the Italian president - may also be back in the frame: Italian bonds, which suffered heavy selling on Tuesday, appear to have recovered slightly. The yield - which moves inversely to the actual bond price - on two year bills has dipped 33 basis points to 2.095% having hit five year highs. The ten year yield is down 12 basis points at 2.98%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears over the political chaos in Italy spread to the US and Asia overnight, and European markets are expected to open lower as a consequence. After the collapse of the coalition in Italy as the president vetoed its choice of finance minister, former IMF man Carlos Catterelli was put in as interim prime minister. But his failure to come up with a list of ministers reinforced the prospect of new elections before long. The prospect of the anti-EU parties winning more of the popular vote was one of the main factors spooking the markets, with the idea of Italexit gaining ground. But reports that the two mooted coalition partners, 5 Star and the Lega party, could make a new attempt to form a government could provide some relief to the markets, if such a move is seen as credible. Even so, European investors remain nervous, not least because Wall Street tumbled 1.58% on Tuesday and the Nikkei 225 is currently down a similar amount. Here\u2019s our story on the fall in Asian markets: Banking shares were among the biggest fallers on Tuesday, as Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, explains: Big banks dropped the hardest, struck by a double whammy of investors trying to suss out which lenders are capable of surviving a fresh eurozone storm; in addition to being hit by lower US bond yields as investors brought into safe haven treasuries. A lower yield environment is considered less profitable for the banks, a sector which dived as the US 10-year bond enjoyed its biggest rally since the Brexit referendum in 2016, sending yields 15 basis points lower to 2.78. The latest action has put the recent 4 year high of 3.08% 10yr yields into the history books, at least for the time being. The S&amp;P closed 1.2% lower whilst the financial sector shed 3.4%, as the likes of Citibank, JP Morgan, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley closed 4% lower. There are other causes for concern for investors, not least the no-confidence vote facing the Spanish government on Friday. And of course, in such a febrile environment, it is no surprise that President Trump has waded in and ratcheted up the trade row between the US and China. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: [Markets face] the prospect of elevated trade tensions after President Trump announced that the US would be proceeding with $50bn worth of tariffs on Chinese in imports. With EU exemptions on US tariffs also due to expire this Friday, markets are likely to find it difficult to catch a break today. Here are the opening calls for Europe from IG: There are also some economic figures to keep an eye on, as well as what could be a lively annual meeting of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank has already announced that finance director Ewen Stevenson is stepping down from his role to take up an opportunity elsewhere.

The sharp surge in oil prices in combination with several public holidays and long weekends pushed up energy prices, leisure costs and food prices. Under the surface of (too) many one-off factors, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication and clothing. Where available, core inflation measures at the state levels actually dropped in May.</p> <p>Despite today\u2019s increase in headline inflation, the underlying trend still points to a rather benign picture for inflationary pressure. For the ECB, however, today\u2019s inflation data from Germany gives a foretaste of the increased complications on the road to taper. The still undecided debate on whether the Eurozone economy is in a soft patch or at the start of a protracted downswing, the surge in oil prices and latest political developments in Italy have clearly complicated the ECB\u2019s life. It increasingly looks as if the big question for the ECB is not when to stop QE but rather when to signal an extension of QE. With latest market turmoil and political tensions in Italy, giving some certainty in times of uncertainty could be the ECB\u2019s preferred policy choice. This would be an announcement or at least a very clear hint at QE extension at the June meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0e9568e4b069235b5ce740\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-30T12:19:59.120Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German inflation jumps to higher than expected 2.2%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The cost of buying goods and services in Germany has soared above the European Central Banks target of 2%, according to official figures.</p> <p>Consumer price inflation jumped from 1.4% year on year in April to 2.2% in May, the fastest pace since February 2017 and well above forecasts of a 1.8% rise.

Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It looked as though we were headed for fresh elections as early as July, with negotiations between Five Star Movement and Lega having failed after President Sergio Mattarella vetoed their choice of Finance Minister. Carlo Cottarelli \u2013 a former IMF economist - was tasked with forming a temporary government until further elections are called, ideally next year, but that appears to have failed before it got started. </p> <p>While early elections will arguably be very beneficial to the populist parties, who will cite the rejection of its choice of Finance Minister as evidence of Brussels interference and an abuse of the democratic will of the people, it seems one last attempt to form a government is being discussed. The parties seem unwilling to hold an election in July and have no desire to wait until next year. </p> <p>If a government can be formed that receives the stamp of approval from Mattarella and is therefore seen as not posing a threat to Italy\u2019s place in the eurozone, then this will come as a relief to markets in the near-term. Longer-term risks remain though and both parties will likely use recent events as a platform to drum up opposition to the euro with the end goal of holding its own referendum, something eurozone leaders will understandably fear after the UK result in 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0e83a8e4b0033069060ac4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-30T10:57:47.680Z\">11.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Ken_CityIndex/status/1001778284957503488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Stock markets keep a mixed feel towards midday: FTSE mildly higher (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GBP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GBP</a> just mildly higher helps explain why) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/STOXX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#STOXX</a> +0.07%, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DAX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DAX</a> +0.5%, France&#39;s CAC40 dn 0.2%, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Italy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Italy</a>&#39;s FTSEMIB +1.5% - biggest index riser - Swiss <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SMI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SMI</a> dn 0.3%, US stock index futures each up 0.5% 1/ ^KO</p>&mdash; Ken Odeluga (@Ken_CityIndex) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ken_CityIndex/status/1001778284957503488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0e8318e4b069235b5ce5f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-30T10:56:00.691Z\">11.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in Spain, prime minister Rajoy is resisting the idea of stepping down as he prepares to face Friday\u2019s no confidence vote:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1001776842813173761\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy rules out quitting ahead of  a no-confidence vote in parliament over graft convictions against members of his Popular Party <br> <a href=\"https://t.co/3NCKAjNVjh\">https://t.co/3NCKAjNVjh</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iBJYCQF9Xb\">pic.twitter.com/iBJYCQF9Xb</a></p>&mdash; AFP news agency (@AFP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1001776842813173761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0e7de1e4b0033069060a6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-30T10:34:17.410Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <li>Don\u2019t panic, suggests Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management:</li> <li><br></li> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <li>Everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down.

Still, we recognize the path to resolution is likely to be bumpy and have downgraded our outlook on European assets to account for recent developments.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0e70efe4b00330690609eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-30T09:37:54.419Z\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gusbaratta/status/1001758567224037377\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ok-ish BTP auctions, with stronger 5yr and weaker 10yr (on the latter the size was cut from 2.25 bln max to 1.82 mio).<br>Lots of speculative bids well below market in all bonds.</p>&mdash; Gustavo Baratta \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 (@gusbaratta) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gusbaratta/status/1001758567224037377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FerdiGiugliano/status/1001758874402160641\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The cost of a crisis:<br><br>Italy will pay an average yield of 3% on 10-year bonds auctioned today.

As developments towards a new government continue, uncertainty about the Italian stance towards the EU and the euro will prevail. Even though it is very unclear what the next steps will be, markets have clearly woken up from the euro-risk lull that started after the Macron presidential election victory in France last year. This continued uncertainty will weigh on Eurozone growth in the months ahead, and a bounce back to growth rates seen in 2017 seems very difficult. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"863c5027da90a5b69feefffc5f694ac7c1413d41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/863c5027da90a5b69feefffc5f694ac7c1413d41/0_94_4031_2418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hand Spinner Around Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0e6b17e4b00330690609b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-30T09:17:58.834Z\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone economic sentiment slips</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Economic confidence in the eurozone dipped slightly in May, according the European Commission.</p> <p>The economic sentiment index slipped by 0.2 points to 112.5 in the eurozone, but edged up 0.4 points to 112.8 in the wider EU.

The prospect of the anti-EU parties winning more of the popular vote was one of the main factors spooking the markets, with the idea of Italexit gaining ground.</p> <p>But reports that the two mooted coalition partners, 5 Star and the Lega party, could make a new attempt to form a government could provide some relief to the markets, if such a move is seen as credible.</p> <p>Even so, European investors remain nervous, not least because Wall Street tumbled 1.58% on Tuesday and the Nikkei 225 is currently down a similar amount.</p> <p>Here\u2019s our story on the fall in Asian markets:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/30/asian-shares-and-euro-fall-sharply-as-italy-fears-spread-to-global-markets\">Asian shares and euro fall sharply as Italy fears spread to global markets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Banking shares were among the biggest fallers on Tuesday, as Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Big banks dropped the hardest, struck by a double whammy of investors trying to suss out which lenders are capable of surviving a fresh eurozone storm; in addition to being hit by lower US bond yields as investors brought into safe haven treasuries. A lower yield environment is considered less profitable for the banks, a sector which dived as the US 10-year bond enjoyed its biggest rally since the Brexit referendum in 2016, sending yields 15 basis points lower to 2.78. The latest action has put the recent 4 year high of 3.08% 10yr yields into the history books, at least for the time being.</p> <p>The S&amp;P closed 1.2% lower whilst the financial sector shed 3.4%, as the likes of Citibank, JP Morgan, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley closed 4% lower.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are other causes for concern for investors, not least the no-confidence vote facing the Spanish government on Friday.</p> <p>And of course, in such a febrile environment, it is no surprise that President Trump has waded in and ratcheted up the trade row between the US and China. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Markets face] the prospect of elevated trade tensions after President Trump announced that the US would be proceeding with $50bn worth of tariffs on Chinese in imports. With EU exemptions on US tariffs also due to expire this Friday, markets are likely to find it difficult to catch a break today. </p> </blockquote> <p>Here are the opening calls for Europe from IG:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/1001698856407633923\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTSE</a> 7615 -0.23%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DAX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DAX</a> 12644 -0.18%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CAC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CAC</a> 5393 -0.82%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIB</a> 21140 -0.99%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBEX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IBEX</a> 9478 -0.45%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/1001698856407633923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 30, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>There are also some economic figures to keep an eye on, as well as what could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/30/government-urged-to-use-rbs-majority-stake-to-veto-branch-closures\">a lively annual meeting of the Royal Bank of Scotland</a>.

      "bodyText": "Sunny weather, the royal wedding and the FA Cup sparked bumper sales of burgers, sun cream and non-alcoholic beer, with shoppers splashing out \u00a3415m on the Friday before the Duke and Duchess of Sussex tied the knot and Chelsea beat Manchester United. The grocery market rose by 2.7% in the three months to 20 May, up from 2% reported a month ago, according to Kantar Worldpanel. \u201cThe sun shone on the grocery market over the past month with record-breaking temperatures, a bank holiday weekend and royal wedding fever all contributing to a bumper period,\u201d said Chris Hayward, a consumer specialist at Kantar. He said the festivities and warm weather encouraged shoppers to fire up the barbecue with sales of burgers and sausages up by 39% and 12% respectively, while non-alcoholic beer sales jumped by 64%. Over 16.6m households chose to pick up an ice-cream as temperatures soared. Brits were also slathering on the sun cream with sales rocketing by 64% on this time last year. Over the early May bank holiday, spending in supermarkets was up 10% compared to the same long weekend last year as temperatures reached record highs. The strong sales came despite inflation of 2.1%, down from 2.5% two months ago and 3.6% at the beginning of the year. Kantar expects inflation to fall slightly this year, but pricescontinue to rise particularly fast in goods such as butter and canned colas. \u201cGrowth is well ahead of inflation, indicating that despite any underlying concerns shoppers may have around balancing the monthly household budget, they are willing to spend on food and drink,\u201d said Mike Watkins, the UK head of retailer insight at analysts Nielsen. Nielsen said the heatwave had helped the supermarkets to sell more food and drink, rather than relying on inflation to boost sales. Alcoholic drinks were up 12%, soft drinks 13%, ice-cream 41%, and crisps and snacks 7.5% as Brits dined alfresco. Morrisons was the strongest performer of the big four traditional supermarkets with growth of 2.9%, according to Kantar, ahead of Asda on 2.8% and Tesco on 2.2%. Sainsbury\u2019s is trailing the market with just 1% growth, but at least one analyst suggested this may be as a result of the supermarket switching sales of non-food products to its fast-growing network of Argos concessions. Lidl was the only high street grocer to see growth in double digits with sales up 10.4%. Aldi\u2019s sales rose by 6.7%, its lowest growth since the end of 2010. Analysts said growth at both Lidl and Aldi was being driven by store openings, with sales at established stores rising at a slower pace than the traditional supermarkets. \u201cThe German discounters continue to show signs of fatigue,\u201d said James Grzinic, a retail analyst at Jefferies. But figures from the home goods store B&amp;M underlined how cut-price chains are benefiting from an increasingly competitive market in which shoppers are looking to save money. The discounter said sales rose 4.7% at its established UK stores in the year to 31 March, underpinning a 25% rise in group profits to \u00a3229.3m despite a 52% crash in profits at the group\u2019s German chain Jawoll. B&amp;M said poor weather had hit sales of gardening goods in Germany and the business also experienced disruption from the arrival of a new management team. Total sales for B&amp;M rose 22% to \u00a32.9bn over the year and the company said it saw opportunities to expand into new areas as a \u201cconstant flow\u201d of stores coming on to the market as other retailers failed was making it easier to grow.",

      "bodyText": "Unemployment will drop to its lowest level since 1980 across the world\u2019s richest nations, but global growth remains dependent on cheap borrowing and government spending, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) has warned in its latest global economy health check. The rise of tit-for-tat protectionist trade barriers, the return of volatile financial markets, and soaring oil prices also spell trouble for the global economy as it heads towards the 10-year anniversary of the 2008 banking collapse, the OECD said. \u201cThe economic expansion is set to continue for the coming two years, and the short-term growth outlook is more favourable than it has been for many years,\u201d said Angel Gurr\u00eda, secretary general of the OECD, the Paris based thinktank for the world\u2019s 35 richest nations, including the US, Britain, Mexico and Japan. \u201cHowever, the current recovery is still being supported by very accommodative monetary policy, and increasingly by fiscal easing. This suggests that strong, self-sustaining growth has not yet been attained.\u201d Central banks in Britain, the eurozone, Japan and the US have kept interest rates low and pumped funds into their economies via quantitative easing to maintain investment and promote growth. Governments have eased back on austerity measures, allowing more state funds for infrastructure projects and welfare payments, especially pensions. Last year, Gurr\u00eda clashed with the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, when he suggested that a second referendum on EU membership would significantly benefit the economy. Like most international agencies, the OECD has warned that leaving the EU will harm foreign investment into the UK and lower potential growth. The latest economic outlook for the UK says the economy is in better shape than the OECD expected last September when it predicted that Britain would only manage to grow by 1%. It says the economy will grow by 1.4%, up from its previous estimate of 1%, and 1.3% next year. Despite the slightly stronger prospects for growth, the unemployment rate would edge up gradually. The main risk to the forecast remained the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. \u201cIf high uncertainty persists, the drag on capital expenditure could intensify as businesses delay plans further,\u201d the report said. \u201cBy contrast, deferred plans may be brought forward if businesses gain clarity about future trading arrangements, pushing up investment growth in the short run. \u201cIn addition, prospects of maintaining the closest possible economic relationship with the European Union would lead to stronger-than-expected economic growth,\u201d it added. The outlook calls for governments to reignite economic reforms while low interest rates and strong global growth persist. Countries should improve tax and spending policies to boost investment and raise living standards across the income distribution. Governments should also boost spending on digital and physical infrastructure, enhance research and development collaboration between universities and industry, reduce barriers to entry in professional services sectors and cut red tape. \u201cPolicymakers need to put greater focus on structural policies to boost skills and to improve productivity to achieve strong, sustainable and inclusive growth,\u201d Gurr\u00eda said.
