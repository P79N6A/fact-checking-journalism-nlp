      "bodyText": "High street retailers enjoyed a modest rebound in sales last month as shoppers stocked up on summer clothes, barbecue food and outdoor toys, according to industry figures. The warm weather helped like-for-like sales rise 0.5% on the year in May, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. It brought some relief to retailers after falling sales in the previous two months, but the trade group said conditions remained tough. \u201cClothing made a big comeback this month after suffering declines in April. This appears to be due to consumers waiting for just the right moment before embarking on their pre-summer spending,\u201d said BRC\u2019s chief executive, Helen Dickinson. \u201cHowever, with signs that the UK\u2019s economy is slowing it\u2019s unlikely that this is the beginning of a complete reversal of fortunes. The uncertain outlook means that customers will remain cautious with their spending, therefore we expect sales figures to remain volatile for the time being.\u201d There were also increases in the sales of household appliances, beauty products and toys in May, but people appeared more reluctant to spend on bigger items such as furniture, perhaps linked to a slowdown in the housing market, BRC said. The report showed food sales enjoyed their fastest growth since October, rising 0.3% on the year in total terms, which does not adjust for the effect of new store openings. The BRC said sales were down in like-for-like terms, but it would not say by how much. The market researchers IGD, which compiled the BRC\u2019s food figures, said it was encouraging to see retailers were able to eke out an increase in total sales despite lower prices in the fiercely competitive sector. The Euro 2016 tournament starting this week was further cause for optimism for grocers, said IGD\u2019s chief executive, Joanne Denney-Finch. \u201cBig international football tournaments are usually good for food and drink sales, and this time there are three UK teams to support,\u201d she said. The news of a pickup in sales will allay fears that households are curbing spending ahead of the EU referendum this month. With opinion polls tight, there have been signs that businesses are deferring spending decisions until after the vote, but consumers appear less affected. Separate figures from Barclaycard also suggest consumer spending rebounded in May, rising 3.6% on a year earlier after two months of weak growth. Warmer weather brought a seasonal boost to spending on clothing, DIY, gardening and entertainment, according to Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of all UK card transactions. It also surveyed more than 1,700 people to gauge consumer confidence and found optimism about household finances picked up in May while confidence in the UK economy fell. \u201cConsumers are increasingly confident in their ability to manage their own finances, but their view of the health of UK plc has continued to fall as a consequence of continuing nervousness over the wider economy,\u201d said Barclaycard\u2019s managing director of corporate affairs, Paul Lockstone. \u201cWhile it is encouraging to see May\u2019s numbers move sharply positive, 2016 spending is trending significantly below last year so it will be interesting to see whether these numbers are a seasonal blip or the beginning of a real and sustainable upturn in consumer spending.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The 32-year-old billionaire owner of Twinkies has added the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles to his collection. Daren Metropoulos, the son of Greek American billionaire and private equity tycoon C Dean Metropoulos, has bought the infamous home of celebrity pornographer Hugh Hefner for about $200m. He currently lives in a $18m mansion next door and plans join the two properties together to create a 7.3 acre compound. But, there\u2019s a catch. Metropoulos won\u2019t be able to move into the 29-room Playboy mansion in the exclusive Holmby Hills neighbourhood until its current tenant, \u201cMr Playboy\u201d dies. Hefner is 90. \u201cWe can confirm that the Playboy Mansion is in escrow with Daren Metropoulos as the buyer,\u201d a Playboy Enterprises spokesman told the Guardian. \u201cDue to confidentiality restrictions, we are not able to comment on any specifics, including what contingencies need to be cleared to close the sale.\u201d Metropoulous, whose private equity firm bought Twinkies-owner Hostess Brands in 2013 and previously bought and sold Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR) beer, did not respond to requests for comment. He told the Wall Street Journal that: \u201cThe heritage of this property transcends its celebrity and to have the opportunity to serve as its steward would be a true privilege.\u201d The young entrepreneur is no stranger to the Playboy mansion. In 2013 he and his brother Evan hosted a party with Snoop Dogg in the mansion\u2019s grounds where they partied with Hefner and the Playboy bunnies. The mansion, which Playboy Enterprises bought for just over $1m in 1971, boasts according to its $200m listing, 12 bedrooms, a wine cellar, home theater, separate game house, gym, tennis court, a swimming pool \u201cwith a large, cave-like grotto\u201d and, of course, an official zoo license and pet cemetery. Playboy put the property up for sale earlier this year as part of the magazine\u2019s restructuring as it struggles in an age of boundless free internet pornography. At the time Playboy\u2019s chief executive Scott Flanders promised that Hefner would not be asked to leave the property until he dies. \u201cThe Playboy mansion has been a creative center for Hef as his residence and workplace for the past 40 years, as it will continue to be if the property is sold,\u201d Flanders said. A-list celebrities are regularly invited into the estate\u2019s gates, past the \u201cPlaymates at Play\u201d sign, to extravagant parties where alcohol flows freely and scantily clad women abound. Leonardo DiCaprio, Rihanna and Naomi Campbell attended a party there last year. There is a rumor that John Lennon put a cigarette out on a Matisse there while separated from Yoko Ono. And in March 2015, Playboy reporters found blueprints that showed tunnels built from the mansion to the homes of celebrities including Jack Nicholson and Kirk Douglas. Hefner said in 2011 that he paid young women living at the mansion with whom he was sexually involved a $1,000-a-week allowance in cash and held them to a 9pm curfew. One of Hefner\u2019s ex-girlfriends, Izabella St James, wrote in her book Bunny Tales about the mansion\u2019s dirty carpets and stained mattresses. \u201cAlthough we all did our best to decorate our rooms and make them homey, the mattresses on our beds were disgusting \u2013 old, worn and stained,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe sheets were past their best, too.\u201d Then there was the health scare in February 2011, when more than 100 people fell ill after a party at the mansion. Health authorities said it may have been caused by bacteria identified in the whirlpool spa.",

    "webTitle": "MPs accuse Sir Philip Green of being an 'unscrupulous chancer'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "MPs have lambasted Sir Philip Green for the demise of BHS, accusing him of being an \u201cunscrupulous chancer\u201d and of overseeing \u201cwealth extraction rather than wealth creation\u201d. Green has come under fire after BHS collapsed with a pension deficit of \u00a3571m despite the tycoon and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership \u2013 before he sold it for \u00a31 to a man who had been declared bankrupt three times. The Conservative MP David Davis said Green\u2019s management of BHS \u201ccan be described as little else than asset stripping\u201d, while Roger Mullin, the SNP Treasury spokesman, said \u201cmany will be thinking Green is little better than a corporate crook\u201d \u2013 as he called on the government to clamp down on \u201cunscrupulous chancers\u201d. The shadow business minister Bill Esterson said the allegations over BHS were beyond belief and an example of \u201cwealth extraction rather than wealth creation\u201d during the debate in the House of Commons about the failure of the retailer. The business minister Anna Soubry, said the government would take any misconduct in the downfall of BHS extremely seriously, pledging to ban the people involved as directors and call in the police if necessary. The Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator are investigating the collapse of BHS, and Soubry said she would not comment on the details of the case until the inquiries were concluded. \u201cIt is important we allow the investigation to take place before we rush to judgment,\u201d she said. BHS is being closed down after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the department store chain and its 11,000 staff. Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrator, is now looking for buyers for BHS stores, the brand and its international business. Green owned the retailer for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a collection of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Dominic Chappell. MPs will question Green and Chappell within the next 10 days about their roles in the scandal, starting with Chappell on Wednesday. The work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee published new evidence on Monday as part of their investigation, including the sales agreement for BHS between Green\u2019s investment company Taveta and Retail Acquisitions.

      "bodyText": "The pound swung wildly on currency markets on Monday, reaching extremes of volatility not seen since the financial crisis, as City traders reacted to polls suggesting voters were increasingly likely to send Britain out of the EU this month. The poll boost to the Vote Leave campaign sent the pound tumbling by up to 1.5 cents to below $1.44, adding to a decline of 2 cents last week and indicating the degree of pressure on the UK currency since the remain camp\u2019s lead in the polls began to evaporate. A dovish speech by the US central bank chief, Janet Yellen, hinting that poor jobs data meant the Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise rates this month, steadied the pound \u2013 despite her comments that a vote to leave the EU could hurt the US economy. \u201cOne development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A UK vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions,\u201d she said. Sterling\u2019s value has become increasingly volatile as fears of a Brexit have increased among investors. The index charting the daily swings in the pound\u2019s value has risen to its highest level of volatility since the first quarter of 2009. It is double the level seen in April when the remain camp was ahead in the polls. Elsa Lignos, a foreign exchange expert at City firm RBC, one of many to warn that the pound would come under further pressure should the lead established by Vote Leave be consolidated, said: \u201cBrexit is almost all that matters for the pound at the moment.\u201d Polls by YouGov, ICM and TNS showed the Brexit campaign extending its recent lead as concerns about migration and the costs of EU membership rose to the top of the political agenda. The YouGov poll showed 45% of Britons would vote to leave the EU compared with 41% who would vote to stay in. A separate online survey by TNS showed 43% backed Brexit, while 41% supported continued EU membership. An ICM poll of 2,000 people added to the pressure, with 48% in favour of the UK leaving, up one point on last week, and 43% in favour of remaining. Mark Makepeace, a senior executive at the London Stock Exchange, said the pound was being held up by \u201can underlying belief among City firms\u201d that the remain camp would prove victorious. A Brexit vote would send the pound tumbling, he said. But Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg bank, said there was a good reason the pound had not crashed yet. He said his monitoring of polls showed that while support for remain had slumped to its lowest level all year, \u201canalysis of the underlying poll trends does not point conclusively to a significantly higher Brexit risk\u201d. Most banks, insurers and fund managers have voiced fears about the prospect of Brexit and the impact it could have on sterling. HSBC said earlier this year the pound would fall 20% in the event of a no vote to leave the EU. The boss of Hitachi has become the latest business leader to urge Britain to vote to remain in the EU. Chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi said the Japanese firm, which has its global rail hub in London, had invested over a billion pounds in the UK\u2019s rail and energy sectors. In a Daily Mirror article he wrote: \u201cTogether Japanese investors provide 140,000 direct jobs in the UK, and many more in the supply chain. A recent survey of these companies showed 95% of respondents thought Brexit would be negative for their businesses and for UK jobs; and none wanted to see the UK leave the EU. \u201cFor most global companies like Hitachi, the critical benefit of investing in the UK is that it is the best base for accessing the whole European market of 500m people ... But take away the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, and the future investment case looks very different.\u201d Before the recent falls in sterling, the currency had already declined by 10% against the dollar as the outlook for the UK economy looked uncertain and foreign investment slowed, especially in commercial property. Figures from the car industry and high street stores showed that consumers were more circumspect than last year but far from panicked with spending marginally higher than last year. New car registrations in May rose 2.5% compared with last year to 203,585, the highest for the month since 2002, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. But the trade group noted growth had eased, with May marking the second month running when car registrations rose by less than 3%. Like-for-like retail sales nudged 0.5% higher on the year in May, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. It brought some relief to retailers after falling sales in the previous two months, but the trade group said conditions remained tough. Ulrich Leuchtmann, an analyst at Commerzbank, told the Financial Times: \u201cThe market has become too comfortable with its \u2018things will work out all right\u2019 approach. It would be far less prepared for a Brexit outcome than for a Bremain. That is the reason why these polls receive far more attention and move the market much more than those polls that still see a lead for Bremain.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley is a paper tiger. Having said he would not show up to give evidence to the House of Commons business committee, the Sports Direct boss has changed his mind and now says he will grace MPs with his presence. In truth, there was never the remotest possibility that Ashley would defy the will of parliament. Rupert Murdoch eventually deigned to make an appearance before a select committee, and to adapt Lloyd Bentsen\u2019s putdown of Dan Quayle, Ashley is no Rupert Murdoch. Rather, he has been exposed as the classic bully who backs down as soon as somebody is strong enough to stand up to them. And make no mistake, the House of Commons carries some clout. It has the power to declare Ashley in contempt of parliament. It can decree that he is not a fit and proper person to run a business in a democracy. This was a risk Ashley could not afford to take and if he has any sense, he will be humble and contrite when he gives his evidence. Clearly, there are questions to be answered about working conditions at the Sports Direct warehouse in Shirebrook, where a Guardian investigation revealed that thousands of workers were effectively being paid below the minimum wage and that there was a draconian system of surveillance and searches in place for a cowed workforce. Ashley says he has nothing to hide and will give evidence so that he can defend his company\u2019s \u201cgood name\u201d. He needs to drop the bluster and explain to the MPs exactly what he has done to make sure that working conditions at Shirebrook are in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the law. Consumers no longer seem as taken as they were with the pile \u2019em high, sell \u2019em cheap Sports Direct business model. The press have turned against him. Increasingly friendless in the City, Ashley is faintly reminiscent of Trollope\u2019s Augustus Melmotte, who goes from dizzying success to social pariah when his business empire struggles. The Way We Live Now would be an appropriate title for the eventual report from Ian Wright\u2019s select committee. MPs like to be treated with respect and thus far Ashley has shown precious little of that. The report is unlikely to pull any punches. May sales suggests weather has great influence on public than looming EU referendum The government has been issuing bulletins daily about how terrible life will be after Brexit but the public is not listening. That is the only way to interpret the latest snapshot of spending produced by the British Retail Consortium. Strong sales of barbecue food, summer clothes and outdoor toys suggest that the public is much more influenced by the weather than it is by the looming EU referendum. It is not just small ticket items either. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said sales of new cars last month were the highest for a May since 2002. True the annual rate of increase has tailed off in recent months, but demand is still pretty firm. Were it not for the referendum, George Osborne would be quite happy with the news coming out of the BRC and the SMMT. Consumer spending is holding up well, despite fresh austerity measures, the slowdown in the global economy and a less rapid pace of job creation. But with decision day only two weeks away, the insouciant behaviour of shoppers is a cause for concern. The idea that consumers are oblivous to the fact that a referendum is about to take place seems fanciful in view of the wall-to-wall coverage. That suggests that either voters think there is little chance of Britain leaving or that they don\u2019t think Brexit is nearly as scary as Osbornethe chancellor says it is.

Speaking three days after the emergence of poor US jobs data, the Federal Reserve chair sought to keep her options open. The unemployment news was not great, but it was wrong to read too much into a single month\u2019s figures. The domestic economy was picking up after a sluggish start to the year but the international outlook was less promising. What does all this havering mean for policy? It\u2019s simple. The Fed has not abandoned the idea of raising interest rates, and thinks borrowing costs will eventually have to go up again. But when a central banker uses the words \u201cconcerning\u201d and \u201cdisappointing\u201d to describe the jobless figures, it means that day is some way off.",

      "bodyText": "Hikes to US interest rates might be on hold again thanks to \u201cconsiderable uncertainty about the economic outlook\u201d Janet Yellen suggested in a speech on Monday. Speaking at the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, days after a surprisingly poor report on the state of the US job market, the Federal Reserve chair said gradual increases to the interest rates were \u201clikely to be appropriate\u201d. But she omitted the phrase \u201cin the coming months\u201d \u2013 a phrase that, when spoken by Yellen 10 days ago, many economists took to imply that the Fed was ready to raise rates soon. Among the factors that might persuade the Fed against raising interest rates next week are slowing job creation and US economic growth as well as uncertainty about the UK\u2019s potential exit from the European Union (Brexit) and a slowdown in China\u2019s economy. \u201cEven though the financial stresses that had emanated from abroad at the start of this year have eased, global risks require continued attention,\u201d said Yellen. China still faces \u201cconsiderable challenges\u201d and investors\u2019 perception of risk can change abruptly, she said. \u201cOne development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A UK vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions,\u201d she said. Yellen did not elaborate as to what those repercussions could be. Yellen\u2019s speech came three days after the US Department of Labor announced that the US economy had added just 38,000 jobs in May \u2013 122,000 fewer than expected. The disappointing numbers have been attributed to the fact that 40,000 Verizon workers had been on strike for 44 days. The strike ended 10 days ago. \u201cThe economy added 2.7m jobs last year, an average of about 230,000 a month,\u201d Yellen pointed out Monday. She also noted that wages had gone up, job openings were up, the US economy was \u201cfairly close\u201d to full employment and that people were quitting their jobs, signalling that they were receiving other offers. \u201cThis past Friday\u2019s labor market report was disappointing,\u201d said Yellen, adding: \u201cLet me emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly report.\u201d Last time Verizon workers went on strike, in August 2011, the US economy reported that zero jobs were added. The following month, that number was revised to 57,000 jobs, and the month after to 104,000 jobs. The Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee meets next week, on 14-15 June. There will be no revisions to the jobs report prior to that. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the the first time in nearly a decade last December and two more rate hikes have been expected this year. The next Fed meeting will take place in July, weeks after the June report and the Brexit vote. \u201cIn short, nothing too surprising after Friday\u2019s employment report left little doubt that there would be no tightening at the June 14-15 FOMC meeting,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist for High Frequency Economics. \u201cThe speech is consistent with tightening again before too long, but there is no specificity at all on timing.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sterling is little changed after Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments that US rates could gradually rise without specifying when that might happen, with investors more preoccupied with the Brexit polls showing the Leave camp in the ascendency. The pound is currently down nearly a cent at $1.4451, while against the euro, the UK currency has weakened slightly again, down 0.49% at \u20ac1.2708. Meanwhile the dollar has lost some of its earlier gains against the yen, now up just 0.4% in the wake of Yellen\u2019s speech. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In her comments at Harvard at the end of May, Yellen talked about it being appropriate to raise US interest rates \u201cin the coming months\u201d. Now she has repeated that \u201cfurther gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate\u201d but the timescale appears to have gone. Yellen concludes: To summarize, I have explained why I expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve and why I expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will probably be appropriate to best promote the FOMC\u2019s goals of maximum employment and price stability. I have also laid out the considerable and unavoidable uncertainties that apply to both this outlook for the economy and to the appropriate path of the federal funds rate. My colleagues and I will make our policy decisions based on what incoming information implies for the economic outlook and the risks to that outlook. What is certain is that monetary policy is not on a preset course, and that the Committee will respond to new data and reassess risks so as to best achieve our goals. She pointed to a number of uncertainties for the global economy, including US domestic demand, the outlook for economies elsewhere and the prospect of Brexit: One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions. Yellen\u2019s speech is available here, with a live link here. On the poor US jobs figures on Friday, she said: Although this recent labor market report was, on balance, concerning, let me emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly report. Other timely indicators from the labor market have been more positive. For example, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance--which can be a good early indicator of changes in labor market conditions--remains quite low, and the public\u2019s perceptions of the health of the labor market, as reported in various consumer surveys, remain positive. That said, the monthly labor market report is an important economic indicator, and so we will need to watch labor market developments carefully. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen still expects further gradual increases in interest rates, although she said monetary policy would depend on the outlook for the economy: If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective, as I expect, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate and most conducive to meeting and maintaining those objectives. However, I will emphasize that monetary policy is not on a preset course and significant shifts in the outlook for the economy would necessitate corresponding shifts in the appropriate path of policy. Janet Yellen is up shortly, speaking to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia. Despite fears about the consequences of the referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU, equities are holding their nerve, lifted by a strong performance from commodity companies. The FTSE 100, filled as it is with mining businesses, has outperformed other markets as the recent dollar weakness helped support metal prices. The UK index seemed unfazed by volatility in sterling as a number of new polls showed the Leave campaign in the ascendency. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 63.77 points or 1.03% at 6273.40 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.18% at 10,121.08 France\u2019s Cac edged up 0.04% to 4423.38 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.74% better at 17,625.00 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.25% higher at 8823.5 But in Greece, the Athens market slipped 1.47% to 639.11 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 117 points or 0.67%. Commodity companies are supporting stock markets, not least because of the recent weakness in the dollar following Friday\u2019s poor US jobs numbers. Oil has also moved sharply higher, with Brent crude now up 1.9% at $50.58 a barrel after output in Nigeria was hit by militant attacks on oil infrastructure. Meanwhile there was a 1m barrel drop last week in inventories at Cushing, the delivery point for US crude, according to information group Genscape. The pound is still lower after the raft of EU referendum polls showing the Leave camp in the ascendency, but the currency has come off its worst levels. Sterling is currently down around a cent against the dollar at $1.4467 having hit $1.4381 earlier. The move is complicated by the US currency being affected by the uncertainty over when (or if) the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Investors are hoping for some clarification from Fed chair Janet Yellen shortly. Meanwhile against the euro, the pound is currently down 0.34% at \u20ac1.2725 having reached \u20ac1.2661 earlier. The chance of a June rate hike in the US is much lower now after the poor jobs numbers last week, according to St Louis Fed president James Bullard, but July is still a possibility. In comments to the Wall Street Journal he also said Brexit was not a significant risk for the Fed. Over in Greece, and another deadline apparently looms: So when might the Fed hike rates? Perhaps not even this year, some believe. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: The May US labor market was the exact type of jobs report that could that could upend Federal Reserve policymakers\u2019 hopes of raising rates in June. Remember in January when the Federal Open Market Committee was suggesting it was still going to raise rates four times this year? That was an odd notion then, and it outright laughable now. Before Friday\u2019s labor market report, the Fed funds futures contract was implying around a 22% chance of a rate hike in June. Today, it\u2019s pricing just 4%. Markets have quickly scaled back expectations of any further tightening this year, with the only rate hike projected to come in December (58.5% chance). Still, that\u2019s unconvincing, considering that the Fed has never raised rates unless the Fed funds futures contract has implied at least a 60% chance of hiking rates in the front month. Markets themselves aren\u2019t fully convinced that another hike is coming this year. This doubt about further policy normalisation by the Fed in 2016 is well-founded. We continually express our disbelief that the Fed (or the ECB for that matter) would announce a significant change to policy without concurrently releasing new staff projections and letting Fed Chair Janet Yellen hold a press conference to try and soothe markets. In an effort to become more transparent, central banks have become more predictable. Skipping ahead past June, September is the next time the Fed would have a staff projections update and press conference, but it seems highly unlikely that any policy tightening will be done on the doorstep of what\u2019s already a vicious US Presidential election. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is likely to hint at further rate rises later this year at her speech today, despite last week\u2019s poor US jobs numbers, says Reuters. But an increase this month looks off the table: Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will likely keep the door open to an interest rate hike within the next few months when she speaks on Monday, while striking a balanced tone about recently disappointing jobs growth and mixed signals in the U.S. economy. Yellen\u2019s speech to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT) will address the economy and monetary policy, and is the last public comment by U.S. central bankers before their June 14-15 meeting. The chances of a rate hike at that meeting were all but killed by a report showing the U.S. economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, muting recently upbeat data on consumer spending and overall growth. A sensitive British vote on European Union membership set for later this month is another reason for the Fed to wait. Economists now see July or September as more likely timing for a quarter-point policy tightening, after the central bank lifted off from near-zero rates in December. The full story is here. US markets have joined in the general positive mood for equities, ahead of the speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 100 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened in positive territory. More signs of Leave gaining ground, from spread betting firm IG: It will be a long night for City traders on 23 June, the day of the EU referendum. According to Bloomberg a number of banks, including RBS, JP Morgan, Lloyds Banking Group and Morgan Stanley plan to keep traders in place overnight to monitor market movements as the results unfold. The full story is here. For hints at the timing of further US rate rises, all eyes are on a speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. But ahead of that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart has urged patience following Friday\u2019s disappointing US jobs numbers, telling Bloomberg the economy is on track for only moderate growth and Brexit is a risk for the economy. The pound\u2019s volatility in recent days shows that City traders have been rapidly revising their expectations on this month\u2019s referendum. Ulrich Leuchtmann at Commerzbank sums things up (via the FT) \u201cThe market has become too comfortable with its \u2018things will work out all right\u2019 approach. [It] would be far less prepared for a Brexit outcome than for a \u2018Bremain\u2019. That is the reason why these polls receive far more attention and move the market much more than those polls that still see a lead for \u2018Bremain\u2019.\u201d And that\u2019s why the cost of insuring against wild swings in the pound over the next month is at its highest levels since the financial crisis: The Telegraph have pulled together a few interesting charts on the Brexit issue (click on the tweet to scroll through them). Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency firm World First, reckons the pound could fall sharply in the next couple of weeks. He says the pressure on sterling has intensified, now that several polls are showing the Leave side in the lead. \u201cSterling and Brexit remain odds; falling together like Icarus on a hot Monday in London. With 3 weeks to go I do not think it is incorrect to say that it is anyone\u2019s to win; Leave have the momentum and opinion polls are frankly a mess; the differential between online and telephone polling has broken down. Given the level of campaigning, which has been abysmal, it is no surprise that polling is so confused; the electorate is confused and I think polls are showing more of an off-the-cuff-which-way-the-wind-is-blowing-at-this-particular-moment voting intention, not longer held beliefs. In this atmosphere momentum is key; the Remain camp has to get agitated.\u201d \u201cIt seems to be however that the economy is not what agitates British voters anymore and once someone makes immigration their top voting priority there is little than can shift that, regardless of how much of a monetary hit may be forthcoming.\u201d Although the pound is down, shares in London have actually risen to a one-week high today. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has jumped by 60 points, or around 1%, to 6268 points. The rally is led by mining stocks, who are benefitting from rising commodity prices today. That\u2019s because the US dollar has fallen against most currencies (but not the pound, obviously), following the disappointing American jobs figures on Friday. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s Remain campaign event: University of Kent professor Matthew Goodwin has crunched the latest polling: The \u2018Purdah\u2019 period began on Friday 27 May, meaning the government cannot use the civil service to push the Remain side\u2019s message. Breaking: ICM have just issued a poll showing that the Leave campaign hold a five-point leave over Remain, at 48% to 43%. It\u2019s their regular online poll, which took place after Sky News held two debates last week - one with David Cameron, and one with Leave campaigner Michael Gove. ICM says that the polls appear to have moved: After a fairly tumultuous week in which both Prime Minister and Michael Gove set out their stalls on TV, ICM\u2019s weekly tracker and indeed at least two other polls published in the last 24 hours, suggest a move to Leave might have occurred. Our poll today has Leave on 48% (+1), Remain on 43% (-1) with Don\u2019t Knows still on 9%. This equates to a 53% vs 47% lead for Leave. Our poll somewhat reinforces a Yougov poll this morning which found a 4-point move to Leave, and polls from TNS and Opinium which also gave cause for concern for the Remain camp. All these polls were conducted online, however, and outside of ICM\u2019s unexpected leap toward Leave in our phone poll last week, no other evidence has been forthcoming from phone polls that Remain are falling back. If new phone polls do emerge with such an outcome, however, we could be more confident that \u2013 irrespective of where the actual standings are on a poll-by-poll basis \u2013 Leave have pushed on. Turnout levels appear to be surging. Caution is always advised when it comes to polls estimating actual turnout, as polls nearly always overstate it, but the 10/10 certainty figure has nudged up to 71% now, suggesting that the public are now more engaged with the referendum than at any previous point. Buzzfeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli explains that this equates to a six-point margin (once don\u2019t knows are removed): The pound had been recovering a little, but this poll has sent sterling reeling back towards its three-week lows. That means it has shed one and a half cents against the US dollar, to $1.4381. David Cameron has been speaking at the Britain Stronger in Europe event. The prime minister had pointed to the economic uncertainty of Brexit, claiming that leaving the EU would \u2018put a bomb under our economy\u2019. Cameron predicted an \u201cimmediate shock effect\u201d from a Leave vote: Almost everyone now agrees, from the Governor of the Bank of England to the IMF, the OECD to the Treasury, 9 in 10 economists to, yes, even some Leave campaigners, there would be an economic shock if we left Europe. Let\u2019s be clear what that means: The pound falling; prices rising; house prices collapsing; mortgage rates increasing; businesses going bust; and unemployment going up. In other words: a recession. And he also argues that British trade would suffer badly, during years of uncertainty as politicians tried to negotiate an exit from the EU. Think of the impact on BMW, for example. 80 per cent of Minis are exported. Think of the wider impact: fewer businesses, fewer jobs, a smaller economy and less money for our schools and hospitals. Add those things together \u2013 the shock impact, the uncertainty impact, the trade impact \u2013 and you put a bomb under our economy. And the worst thing is we\u2019d have lit the fuse ourselves. He was speaking alongside Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green leader Natalie Bennett. Our EU Referendum Live blog has full details: Today\u2019s selloff means the pound has shed 2% of its value in the last fortnight. Darren Ruane, head of fixed interest at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says sterling is suffering the brunt of Brexit uncertainty. Although bookmakers\u2019 odds continue to show a victory for the Remain campaign, any signs that the vote\u2019s result is closer than previously predicted is likely to affect the UK\u2019s currency by the greatest amount relative to other asset classes. Currencies are often good barometers of international investors\u2019 confidence in the economic outlook for a country.\u201d The YouGov report also finds that the public don\u2019t trust certain politicians over the EU referendum. David Cameron has particularly poor trust ratings, it appears, with 19% of those polled trusting the PM, and 72% not trusting him. Alexandra Russell-Oliver, analyst at currency firm Caxton FX, reckons this is a factor: \u201cMany Leave campaigners have cited distrust for the Prime Minister as a main reason for backing Brexit.\u201d The YouGov results are online here. YouGov has also found that a majority of people back the Leave campaign, even if Brexit hit them in the pocket. Its new poll asked people to imagine that they were \u00a3100 per year worse off after a Brexit; 44% of people said they would vote to leave, while 42% would vote to remain. A month ago, this question showed a small majority for Remain. The latest car registration figures suggest that EU uncertainty may be hitting consumer confidence. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) just reported that sales to private customers fell by 3.0% year-on-year in May. Total sales rose by 2.5%, though, thanks to higher demand for \u201cfleet buyers\u201d (such as car rental firms). SMMT CEO Mike Hawes says the market appears to be cooling in the face of the EU referendum. Whether this is the result of some buyers holding off until the current uncertainty is resolved or a sign of a more stable market for new cars remains to be seen.\u201d YouGov have just confirmed that their latest poll shows a move towards Brexit: Labour MP Stephen Kinnock fears that the political infighting between Conservative politicians is distracting from the serious questions around Brexit. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a moment ago, Kinnock warns there could be a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d if the Leave campaign wins, as we don\u2019t know what relationship Britain would seek with the EU. We need a better discussion about what a post-Brexit UK would look like.... What trading arrangements we would have, the relationship with the single market. the two million British people living outside the UK. Kinnock adds that \u201cleaving the single market would wreck the UK economy\u201d, and that the steel industry in his Welsh constituency (home of the Port Talbot steel works) would be finished. [Kinnock\u2019s father Neil, incidentally, is a former European Commissioner] But former chancellor Lord Lawson is arguing that it\u2019s \u201cbaloney\u201d to argue that Britain\u2019s trade would suffer badly if it left the single market. Most of the world is outside the single market, and most of the world is doing better than the countries in the single market. According to the BBC, some Remain campaigner are considering using their Commons majority to keep Britain inside the EU single market if there is a vote for Brexit. The pound has fallen against every other major currency this morning, following the string of opinion polls showing the Leave side leading the referendum battle. Bloomberg\u2019s Garfield Reynolds writes that sterling suffered a \u201cvery ugly start\u201d to the week: With less than three weeks to the June 23 referendum, investors have been disconcerted as the \u2018Leave\u2019 campaign gains traction. The currency dropped as much as 1.1% to $1.4353 on Monday and was down against all 16 major peers, while one-month volatility surged to 21.34 percent, a level last seen in February 2009. And this chart shows how the pound fell against the US dollar (white line), while sterling volatility spiked (as explained earlier). This chart highlights how the pound has weakened against the euro in the last couple of weeks, hitting a three week low today (the blue line): James Appleyard of risk management group Maplethorpe also expects a lot more sterling volatility: Our rivals at the Daily Telegraph have also helped to send the pound sliding today, analysts say. A survey of almost 19,000 Telegraph subscribers found that 69% are intending to vote for a Brexit at the June 23 referendum. The poll also found that Leave campaigner Boris Johnson is their favoured candidate to succeed David Cameron as prime minister. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed says this report has hurt sterling: This was the most shocking survey released so far, and with only 18 days until the referendum the GBP is extremely sensitive to opinion polls. YouGov and TNS online polls didn\u2019t help either as both revealed that the leave campaign has picked up momentum and now leads over remain voters. Given the Telegraph\u2019s traditional audience, it\u2019s perhaps not such a surprise \u2013 but it may have surprised global investors who don\u2019t have a tight grip on UK media habits.... Sterling is likely to experience wild swings in over the next few weeks, in the run-up to the referendum. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange company OANDA, explains: \u201cThe polls are likely to make people rather uneasy and we can see that quite clearly today in the pound. \u201cWith both sides likely to step up their game over the next couple of weeks, I imagine we\u2019ll see a lot more volatility in the pound and the closer the polls get, or if \u2018Vote Leave\u2019 continues to push ahead, the pound may find itself back towards April\u2019s lows before too long.\u201d (via Reuters) The pound\u2019s early morning slide came as the Remain campaign prepares to accuse the Leave side of trying to con voters about the consequences of Brexit. My colleague Claire Phipps explains: David Cameron might not want to face fellow Conservatives in debates over Britain\u2019s future but today he\u2019ll issue a statement with politicians usually found on the opposite side of the Commons, teaming up with Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green party leader Natalie Bennett to label the Brexit campaign a \u201ccon-trick\u201d. Together they\u2019ll accuse Leave campaigners \u2013 including the prime minister\u2019s own party chums Michael Gove and Boris Johnson \u2013 of producing \u201ccontradictory statements\u201d about Britain\u2019s economic future outside the EU, saying the Brexiteers have put forward 23 different positions on the alternative to the single market. Full coverage in our EU Referendum liveblog: And Britain\u2019s trade unions are warning that workers\u2019 rights could be swiftly eroded after a Brexit vote. Our frontpage story explains: In a joint intervention, the general secretaries of Unite, Unison, the GMB and Usdaw were among 10 trade union leaders warning that the Conservatives would \u201cnegotiate away our rights\u201d if the UK decides to leave. They argued leaving the EU would pose a great threat to maternity and paternity pay and leave, the right to paid leave for holidays and equal treatment for full, part-time and agency workers. Shares in UK housebuilders are under pressure this morning, matching the slide in sterling. Berkeley Group, Persimmon, Barratt Development and Taylor Wimpey are the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde blames Brexit fears: Some economists believe that the Bank of England could be forced to raise interest rates if Britain votes to leave the EU, to fight a plunge in the pound. That would obviously drive up mortgage costs. Traders are scrambling to protect themselves against the pound plunging after this month\u2019s referendum. The cost of insuring against sterling volatility has hit its highest level since the wild days following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. That shows that investors are expecting sterling to move sharply after the result of the EU vote is known. FastFT have the details: One-month implied sterling volatility, or the price of insuring against swings in the pound against the dollar, has jumped to 21.9, the highest since February 2009. It hasn\u2019t topped 15 in six years. Sue Trinh, head of Asian foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, says the EU referendum could easily roil global markets. \u201cA \u2018Leave\u2019 vote would expose a host of uncertainties. \u201cIt would be more negative for the euro and the EU since the issue will drag on for other members.\u201d That\u2019s via Bloomberg: The pound is sliding this morning after a string of opinion polls gave the Brexit campaign a lead in the 23 June EU referendum. Sterling tumbled in early trading, shedding more than 1.5 cents against the US dollar. It has hit a three-week low of $1.4355, down 1.1%. It is also losing ground against other developed currencies. Against the euro, the pound is down 1 eurocent at \u20ac1.2661. Traders are reacting to yesterday\u2019s Observer/Opinium poll, which gave the Brexit campaign a three percentage point lead. As my colleague Daniel Boffey reported: The leave campaign has picked up momentum and taken a three-point lead over remain in the latest Observer/Opinium poll on the EU referendum. The Brexiters now stand on 43%, while 40% say they support the campaign to keep the UK in the union. The poll suggests the remain camp has lost four percentage points in the last two weeks, during which Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have relentlessly campaigned on the theme of immigration. And aYouGov poll for ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain has put Leave in front on 45% and Remain on 41%, according to overnight reports. Many analysts have predicted that the pound would tumble if Britain voted to leave the EU, possibly as low as $1.20 against the US dollar. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets confirms that the City is reacting to signs that the Brexit campaign is gaining momentum. The pound looks set to start the week on the back foot as the opinion polls continue to point to an increasingly close contest in the UK referendum as speculation increases about further gains in the polls for the leave camp. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a new bout of jitteriness in the City today, after last Friday\u2019s US employment report missed expectations by a mile. The news that just 38,000 new jobs were created in America last month has sparked fresh worries about the global economy. So there\u2019s a lot of interest in a speech from Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, later today (5.30pm BST). Could she hint that a June rate rise is less likely? Analysts at RBC predict that Yellen could move the markets: The chance of a July hike dropped from 65% on Friday morning to 32% by Friday afternoon,which seems reasonable, but Yellen\u2019s speech today could push that back above 50% or closer to zero, so either way, the chance for a US dollar move seems high. Investors are also worrying about Britain\u2019s EU referendum, on June 23rd, with the latest polling suggesting the vote is tight. At 9am, we find out how many new cars were sold in the UK in May. A poor number could show that Brexit worries are hitting consumer confidence. In the eurozone.... We get a new healthcheck on Germany\u2019s economy, with new factory order and construction data this morning. Worryingly, factory orders have fallen by 2% month-on-month. And Italy will also be in focus, after the anti-austerity Five Star Movement took a large lead in the first round of voting for the mayor of Rome.",

Perhaps not even this year, some believe.</strong> Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The May US labor market was the exact type of jobs report that could that could upend Federal Reserve policymakers\u2019 hopes of raising rates in June. Remember in January when the Federal Open Market Committee was suggesting it was still going to raise rates four times this year? That was an odd notion then, and it outright laughable now.</p> <p>Before Friday\u2019s labor market report, the Fed funds futures contract was implying around a 22% chance of a rate hike in June. Today, it\u2019s pricing just 4%.</p> <p>Markets have quickly scaled back expectations of any further tightening this year, with the only rate hike projected to come in December (58.5% chance). Still, that\u2019s unconvincing, considering that the Fed has never raised rates unless the Fed funds futures contract has implied at least a 60% chance of hiking rates in the front month. Markets themselves aren\u2019t fully convinced that another hike is coming this year.</p> <p>This doubt about further policy normalisation by the Fed in 2016 is well-founded. We continually express our disbelief that the Fed (or the ECB for that matter) would announce a significant change to policy without concurrently releasing new staff projections and letting Fed Chair Janet Yellen hold a press conference to try and soothe markets.</p> <p>In an effort to become more transparent, central banks have become more predictable.

But an increase this month looks off the table:</p> <blockquote> <p>Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will likely keep the door open to an interest rate hike within the next few months when she speaks on Monday, while striking a balanced tone about recently disappointing jobs growth and mixed signals in the U.S. economy.</p> <p>Yellen\u2019s speech to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT) will address the economy and monetary policy, and is the last public comment by U.S. central bankers before their June 14-15 meeting. </p> <p>The chances of a rate hike at that meeting were all but killed by a report showing the U.S. economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, muting recently upbeat data on consumer spending and overall growth. A sensitive British vote on European Union membership set for later this month is another reason for the Fed to wait.</p> <p>Economists now see July or September as more likely timing for a quarter-point policy tightening, after the central bank lifted off from near-zero rates in December.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full story is <strong><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-yellen-idUSKCN0YS142?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social\">here.</a></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-575580a0e4b0d1779f1e17bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:56:31.824Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street rises at open</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have joined in the general positive mood for equities, ahead of the speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 100 points or 0.5% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened in positive territory.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57557bf8e4b0be576f9d9bae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:35:20.002Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More signs of Leave gaining ground, from spread betting firm IG:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/minefornothing/status/739812080195272705\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IG SAYS MORE MONEY NOW BEING TRADED ON AN &quot;OUT&quot; VOTE IN UK&#39;S EU REFERENDUM VS &quot;IN&quot; VOTE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a></p>&mdash; MineForNothing (@minefornothing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/minefornothing/status/739812080195272705\">June 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57557a93e4b052682026580a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:31:48.922Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It will be a long night for City traders on 23 June, the day of the EU referendum.</strong></p> <p>According to Bloomberg a number of banks, including RBS, JP Morgan, Lloyds Banking Group and Morgan Stanley plan to keep traders in place overnight to monitor market movements as the results unfold.</p> <p>The full story is <strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/jpmorgan-rbs-said-to-staff-trading-floors-overnight-for-brexit\">here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57557689e4b0be576f9d9b8f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-06T13:14:21.185Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brexit risk justifies US rate patience - Fed's Lockhart</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For hints at the timing of further US rate rises, all eyes are on a speech later from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.</p> <p>But ahead of that Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart has urged patience following <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/03/markets-await-services-data-for-clues-on-uk-economy-business-live\">Friday\u2019s disappointing US jobs numbers,</a></strong> telling Bloomberg the economy is on track for only moderate growth and Brexit is a risk for the economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/739805047421337600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fed\u2019s Lockhart: Jobs Number, Brexit Justify Patience<br>- On Track For Moderate US Growth</p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/739805047421337600\">June 6, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bsurveillance/status/739804898578051072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AtlantaFed\">@AtlantaFed</a> President Lockhart: Jobs report, Brexit, justify patience.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley is to be questioned by MPs on Tuesday over the treatment of staff at his retail group, with pay and working conditions among the issues expected to come under scrutiny. Last year, the Guardian placed two undercover reporters inside Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. They found that temporary workers there were receiving an effective hourly pay rate below the minimum wage, after being subjected to compulsory searches at the end of shifts and deductions from their pay for late attendance. MPs on the business, innovation and skills select committee have already indicated that they will question Ashley about his pledge to hold a review of working conditions following the revelations. Here are a list of 10 key questions that the billionaire, who is scheduled to appear at 11am, should answer. 1 Has Ashley concluded his internal review, what were its findings and will it be made public? Reports at the weekend, when Ashley finally backtracked and agreed to attend the select committee, suggested that he feels he has now dealt with all the concerns raised about pay and conditions at Shirebrook and is keen to put the matter behind him. He needs to explain in detail what he discovered in the review and how he has dealt with any issues it has raised. 2 What has Sports Direct done to improve working conditions? The criticisms of the retail group have included the general working conditions within the depot. For instance, a daily search \u2013 part of Sports Direct\u2019s zero-tolerance approach to theft \u2013 involves workers lining up before being ordered to strip to the final layer above the waist and empty their pockets. They are then asked to roll up their trouser legs to reveal the brands of their socks and expose the band of their underwear. Occasionally workers are hauled into a side room for a more detailed search. Workers are also told they will walk almost 20 miles each day inside the warehouse as they pick products off the shelves, and their performance is constantly scrutinised. Even fit young adults in their 20s can complain this is gruelling. 3 How many teachers and community leaders did Sports Direct speak to during the review? Local primary school headteachers alleged that Sports Direct warehouse workers were sending their children to school while sick because they feared the sack for taking time off work. Similar claims were made by local religious leaders. In response to the reports, the company said last year it was not \u201caware of any occasions on which sick children have not been able to be collected from school by their parents\u201d. What has it discovered since? 4 After the allegations emerged about warehouse workers being paid, in effect, below the national minimum wage, Sports Direct pledged \u00a310m towards a staff pay rise. Does the company accept, therefore, that compulsory unpaid searches on staff leaving the warehouse meant they were previously receiving pay that was in effect below the minimum wage? After issuing a lengthy defence of its employment practices when announcing Ashley\u2019s review in December, Sports Direct nonetheless pledged \u00a310m towards a staff pay rise. The increase affected an estimated 15,000 workers on zero-hours contracts in stores and 4,000 agency staff in the Shirebrook depot and took effect from 1 January. Why make the concession if the staff were already being paid properly? 5 Is Sports Direct being investigated by HM Revenue &amp; Customs regarding the allegations that workers have been receiving pay that is effectively below the minimum wage? The Guardian\u2019s reports triggered an urgent parliamentary debate in December with the business minister Nick Boles called to the Commons to answer questions on the scandal. He said HMRC can intervene if concerns emerge about specific sectors in the economy. Boles added: \u201cI don\u2019t care how famous an employer is. I don\u2019t care how well connected they are. I don\u2019t care, frankly, how much money they have made. They need to obey the law. If they don\u2019t obey the law, we will find them and disqualify directors if necessary.\u201d MPs on the committee now have an opportunity to find out if these powers have been used regarding Sports Direct. 6 Has Sports Direct had any discussions with workers or their representatives about topping up wages with back pay? If this is the case, then it will raise questions about whether Sports Direct has been paying staff the minimum wage historically. 7 Ashley has said: \u201cNo Sports Direct employees are engaged in the Shirebrook warehouse on a zero-hours contract, and the main agencies have confirmed to us that none of their workers are engaged on a zero-hours contract.\u201d Can he disclose what guaranteed hours warehouse workers are entitled to? While agency contracts seen by the Guardian promise workers some hours in the warehouse, the hours are so few that the distinction between guaranteed work and zero hour-style arrangements, in whichthere is no guaranteed working time, is effectively meaningless. A contract with one Sports Direct agency guarantees 336 hours over a 12-month period. This is equivalent to 1.4 hours a day, assuming a five-day week. The Guardian\u2019s undercover reporters were employed as temporary workers by Sports Direct\u2019s employment agencies in November last year and were not told that they were guaranteed a set number of hours of work a week. Initially they were given 24 hours\u2019 notice if they were required in the warehouse the following day. Both reporters were then put on a five-day shift pattern. 8 Does Sports Direct influence the hourly rates paid to agency workers? Most workers inside the warehouse are employed by two employment agencies, although pay and procedures between both sets appear remarkably consistent. If Sports Direct influenced wages and the internal procedures, then it cannot use the agencies as an excuse for the pay and conditions in its plant. 9 Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse is operational 24 hours a day and for 365 days a year. The facility always requires a substantial number of staff, so why are the vast majority of the workers employed on temporary contracts? Businesses like to say that temporary workers give them flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Certainly it is a valid argument that companies such as Sports Direct will need to take on more staff around Christmas. However, the the Shirebrook warehouse has thousands of people working in it even during quiet times. Why are they on temporary contracts? 10 Will Ashley reveal if any temporary staff have been dismissed after falling foul of a six-strikes-and-you-are-out system at Shirebrook? Warehouse workers are warned they will be sacked if they receive six \u201cstrikes\u201d over a six-month period for offences including: a period of reported sickness; errors; excessive/long toilet breaks; time wasting; excessive chatting; horseplay; and using a mobile phone in the warehouse. Sports Direct says it \u201cdoes not penalise its staff for being ill. Sanctions may be applied if workers fail to follow the company\u2019s reasonable sickness absence notification procedures, which are in line with industry best practice.\u201d But how many workers have been shown the door as a consequence?",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry\u2019s chief executive, Christopher Bailey, has had a 75% pay cut after profits fell at the luxury fashion house. Bailey received almost \u00a31.9m in salary, pension and other benefits last year, down from a total of \u00a37.5m the year before. After receiving \u00a35.7m in cash bonus and share awards for 2014, he got no such payments last year, the company\u2019s annual report showed. His pay was made up of \u00a31.1m in salary, \u00a3330,000 pension contributions and \u00a3464,000 in benefits. His first payment from a controversial share award was also deferred by a year to take account of Burberry\u2019s weakening financial performance. The company, famed for its \u00a31,400 trench coats, has been affected by belt-tightening among the Chinese shoppers who account for about 40% of its sales. Sir John Peace, Burberry\u2019s non-executive chairman, said: \u201cOur overall approach to incentive structures for all staff, including senior management, is based on performance. When the business does not perform as well, this has an impact on what we pay our staff.\u201d Bailey was awarded a million shares for free in 2013 before he became chief executive. The payment date for the first chunk of those shares was scheduled for next month but Burberry said he had asked the remuneration committee to wait a year in light of the difficult trading conditions. \u201cAhead of the new vesting date in July 2017, the committee and Christopher Bailey will again assess the extent to which vesting would be appropriate,\u201d the company said. Bailey, who is also Burberry\u2019s creative director, has been one of the best-paid bosses in the FTSE 100 since his promotion in 2014. Shareholders angry about his share awards voted down Burberry\u2019s remuneration report in 2014 though the deal went through because the vote was not binding. Last year\u2019s AGM was more peaceful and Bailey\u2019s pay was voted through easily. But after a series of bruising annual meetings at which pay reports have been rejected or severely criticised, Burberry appears to have acted to take account of shareholder views to ward off potential trouble. Burberry\u2019s business boomed as newly affluent Chinese shoppers bought its raincoats, scarves and other clothes earlier this decade. But a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy has hit the company\u2019s performance. Profits fell 10% to \u00a3421m last year and the company is cutting jobs and reducing its product range to save money. Once an investor favourite, the shares have dropped by a third in the past year. Burberry\u2019s other executive directors, finance director Carol Fairweather and chief operating officer John Smith, also received no bonus or share awards. Fairweather\u2019s pay fell by \u00a31m to \u00a3683,000 and Smith\u2019s almost halved from \u00a31.52m to \u00a3813,000. Bailey helped turn Burberry from a dull heritage brand into a luxury powerhouse worn by Alexa Chung and Emma Watson and modelled by the sons of David and Victoria Beckham. Burberry said Bailey and other directors would receive no salary increase this year and that it would delay deciding on executive share plan awards by four months to November to see how efficiency measures were progressing.",

New car registrations in May rose 2.5% compared with last year to 203,585, the highest for the month since 2002, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). But the trade group noted growth had eased off with May marking the second month running when car registrations rose by less than 3%. Growth last month came from companies freshening up their business fleets, with that part of the market growing 8.8% on the year before. But registrations to private customers fell 3% and there was also a 20.2% decline in business registrations, which covers companies that have 24 or fewer cars registered. Fleets are those with 25 or more. Business registrations covers a relatively small part of the market and so the figures can be volatile from month to month. Some business surveys have shown companies are putting off spending decisions until after the EU referendum on 23 June. But the SMMT said it was too early to tell if the slowdown in new car registrations was down to the vote. \u201cThe new car market in May remained high with compelling offers available on the latest vehicles, but the low growth is further evidence of the market cooling in the face of concerns around economic and political stability,\u201d said Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive. \u201cWhether this is the result of some buyers holding off until the current uncertainty is resolved or a sign of a more stable market for new cars remains to be seen.\u201d Car sales are a bellwether for overall spending, so the slowdown in registrations to private customers this year was concerning, said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThe fall in car sales cannot be attributed solely to greater consumer caution ahead of the referendum. The fall in consumer confidence this year also has reflected slower growth in real incomes, amid weaker job growth, rising inflation and an intensifying squeeze of welfare spending,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch of the pent-up demand from households that put off car purchases during the recession also has now been satiated.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Football fans who fancy a flutter on Euro 2016 should put their money on France to win the tournament on their own turf, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street bank reckons the French side has a 23% chance of exploiting home advantage to triumph in the final. England will put on a creditable performance by making it into the semi-finals, according to the bank\u2019s predictions, losing out to Spain. However, Goldman warned that \u201cit is difficult to assess how much faith one should have in these predictions\u201d. The bank\u2019s performance at the last major international football tournament was underwhelming, with its prediction of a Brazil victory on home soil flying well wide of the mark. Goldman made Brazil the clear favourites, calculating a probability of 48.5% that the Samba nation would beat fierce rivals Argentina in the final. In fact, Brazil were dumped out of the tournament unceremoniously when they were thrashed 7-1 by Germany in the semi-final. Goldman said Brazil\u2019s failure to live up to expectations, coupled with the group stage exit of both Spain and Italy, showed the \u201ccharming unpredictability\u201d of football. It added that football was \u201cstochastic\u201d, meaning that it conforms to a broad pattern of probabilities but cannot be accurately predicted. Goldman makes Germany, the eventual winners of the 2014 World Cup, only the second favourites to win this year\u2019s tournament despite having a slightly higher rating on the \u201cElo\u201d rating system originally used to rank chess players. The bank backed France to defeat the Germans in the final, in the belief that home advantage will make the difference for Les Bleus. It admitted that this was despite a large number of \u201centhusiastic Germany supporters\u201d among its analysts. While England fans might be heartened by the prediction of a semi-final appearance, courtesy of a quarter-final victory over Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Portugal, Goldman believes there isn\u2019t much to look forward to for the remaining home nations. Wales, boasting the world\u2019s most expensive player, Gareth Bale, was given a 0.1% chance of winning the tournament, as was Northern Ireland. The only nation with worse prospects is Albania, given no chance at all of taking home the trophy.",

      "bodyText": "News of flight cancellations in May has sent shares in easyJet lower, but British Airways owner International Airlines Group is also under pressure. A hefty note by analysts at Barclays sees the bank cut its target price for IAG from 750p to 700p amid concerns about the outlook for airline demand. Barclays says: Even if their margins are still rising thanks to fuel savings, many airlines across the globe would admit that demand is softer than anticipated. In fact, on our analysis, total airline industry revenue is now falling, and its historic correlation with nominal GDP growth appears to have broken down So what exactly is going on? ..We argue that the revenue softness is driven by a combination of demand issues: geopolitical shocks, a mixed economic backdrop, and the effect of low oil prices on revenue, all set against ambitious industry capacity plans. We see reasons to be optimistic into the winter, especially if capacity cuts materialise. But meanwhile, guidance for many airlines hinges on improved trading in peak summer. In detail, Barclays says: Geopolitics: the biggest unknown. We believe sudden shocks to leisure demand from terrorism have been the single biggest contributor to European airline revenue weakness, particularly since the Paris attacks in November. While the shorthaul leisure consumer has proved relatively resilient \u2013 still travelling within Europe, but perhaps switching to \u2018safer\u2019 markets \u2013 inbound longhaul tourists are more likely to avoid the continent outright. We think US, Chinese and Japanese demand could be weak for the rest of this year. However, business travel and outbound longhaul tourism have been fairly immune. Risk of further incidents is clearly reflected in the recent sector derating. \u2018Underlying\u2019 demand: some optimism into the second half. Leaving aside geopolitical shocks, our industry model suggests that the underlying drivers of airline revenue are the economy (nominal GDP) and the oil price (with a lag). The economic backdrop in Europe and the US is perhaps best described as stagnant, and there are significant headwinds in emerging markets with dependency on the energy sector (Brazil, West Africa, Russia). However, provided the core economies remain stable, our model suggests underlying revenue may have troughed in the first half of 2016, as the oil price effect should annualise through the summer and turn positive. Furthermore, if the UK were to vote to remain in the EU, our economists believe corporate capital expenditure would rebound in the second half of the year. Test of capacity discipline. With hindsight, summer capacity was clearly planned with a better demand environment and at lower oil prices ($30 a barrel versus $50 a barrel now). Airlines have been generally good at trimming very weak emerging market routes, but in Europe and the US, growth remains high, as margins are still rising to record levels, even if more of the fuel savings are being offset in yields than anticipated. Into the winter, and especially into 2017, fuel benefits will start to fade and airlines may need to make broader capacity adjustments to sustain higher margins. This will be a real test of the industry\u2019s capacity discipline. We expect US carriers to lead the way, announcing capacity trims at their first half results, potentially marking a turning point for sector sentiment. So IAG shares are currently down 8p or 1.5% at 522p while easyJet is 21p lower at \u00a315.03.",

Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Mining stocks are topping the FTSE100 this morning as the commodities space benefits from a weaker US dollar basket, back below the key 95 level for first time in a fortnight. The currency\u2019s reversal of recent strength comes in response to Friday\u2019s surprisingly weak May US jobs report that must be considered a setback for Janet Yellen and [the Federal Reserve] in terms of ability to tighten US monetary policy further this summer. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 47.03 points at 6256.66 despite a fall in sterling on growing Brexit fears, as new polls show the Leave campaign in the ascendency. Housebuilders have also been hit by concerns about the referendum result, with Berkeley Group down 50p at \u00a331.89 and Barratt Developments down 7p at 571p.",

      "bodyText": "A group representing \u00a3175bn of local authority pension funds has urged its members to vote against the \u00a370m pay awarded to Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, at the advertising firm\u2019s annual general meeting. The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) said Sorrell\u2019s pay deal for 2015, one of the biggest in UK corporate history, was excessive and based on questionable targets. WPP, the world\u2019s biggest advertising company, announced in April it would pay Sorrell \u00a370.4m in cash and shares, taking his earnings since 2009 to \u00a3190m. The company admitted the amount was very large but said it reflected outstanding returns for shareholders. LAPFF, which represents 70 pension funds, said Sorrell\u2019s pay had risen 56% over five years \u2013 twice the rate of increase for shareholder returns. At more than 58 times his \u00a31.15m salary, Sorrell\u2019s variable pay was the highest in the industry, the forum added. The forum said the disconnect between pay and performance cast doubt on the remuneration committee\u2019s ability and resolve to do its job. Kieran Quinn, LAPFF\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cMost shareholders will, in the main, accept what they consider a reasonable level of pay for performance. However, with WPP, we consider there are several aspects of the payment which do not reflect this, and we are advising our member funds to oppose the remuneration report on this basis.\u201d WPP has experienced shareholder rebellions over Sorrell\u2019s pay in the past and was forced to back down over his pay plan four years ago. The AGM in London on Wednesday comes after a series of recent defeats and bruising revolts over pay at companies including BP, Smith &amp; Nephew and Standard Life. ShareAction, which advocates responsible investment, also urged shareholders to vote against the pay deal. Catherine Howarth, the chief executive, said: \u201cSir Martin Sorrell\u2019s pay regularly brings his company, and big companies as a whole, into disrepute.\u201d Sorrell\u2019s pay is based on share awards dating back to 2010 when the share price was 644p. Since then the share price has risen to more than \u00a315. Sorrell\u2019s total pay is 1,444 times the average remuneration of WPP\u2019s 124,930 staff. Sorrell, who founded WPP in 1985 and owns 1.4% of the company, has defended his earnings, arguing a large majority of shareholders approved the pay formula. \u201cIt\u2019s really pay for performance over the long term, over 30-plus years,\u201d he said in April. He said shareholders were entitled to change their minds. Sorrell\u2019s payouts derive from a scheme known as \u201cthe Leap\u201d \u2013 the leadership equity acquisition plan \u2013 which has a year to run after a shareholder revolt in 2012 replaced it with a new scheme, known as \u201cthe executive performance share plan\u201d. LAPFF said that even under the revised plan Sorrell could earn up to 14 times his salary in bonuses. \u201cWhile this plan may be seen as an improvement on the previous Leap scheme, outcomes are still excessive,\u201d it said. A WPP spokesman said the AGM vote covers five years to 2015 during which WPP\u2019s market value rose by more than \u00a310bn and its shares almost doubled, compared with a 5.8% increase in the FTSE 100.",
