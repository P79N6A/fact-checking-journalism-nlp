    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Rich Ricci entered a horse called Fatcatinthehat in the Cheltenham festival last month, he can't have expected it to make front page news on a tabloid. The horse is one of a string owned by the multi-millionaire banker and its name is meant to be a joke. But the gag backfired on the Barclays executive, whose retirement from the scandal-hit bank was announced yesterday. Ricci's massive paycheques and flamboyant behaviour no longer struck the right chord after the bank was hit with a \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor, and at a time when Britons were being forced to tighten their belt. Unusually, the 49-year-old American was not in the parade ring to see Fatcatinthehat or another in the Ricci stable, Champagne Fever, which won the race on the opening day. \"Client meetings\" were cited for his absence from the course, where he has often been seen in his country attire of three-piece tweed suit, trilby and Jack Nicholson-style dark shades. If his racing outfit is a parody of the traditional country gent's then his daily workwear could equally be seen as a pastiche of the archetypical City bigwig, from the colourful braces to the personally monogrammed shirts. While the timing of Ricci's retirement caught the City by surprise on Thursday, the odds on his survival at Barclays had been shortening ever since the bank appointed Antony Jenkins to replace Bob Diamond in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal. \"I can't predict the future,\" Jenkins had said in February, when asked if Ricci would still be running the investment banking arm in a year's time. The strait-laced chief executive, who is trying to repair Barclays' battered reputations, later told the Guardian that he had a \"good personal relationship\" with Ricci, who in turn was telling friends that he had supported Jenkins' appointment to the top job. But even so, things did not augur well for Ricci. Jenkins this week sat the American down to tell him of his plans to \"streamline and improve\" the way bank would be managed in future. Shareholders had been letting it be known that they thought Ricci would need to leave \u2013 not because he was in any way associated with the Libor scandal but just because he was too closely associated with the previous regime. Ricci was by Diamond's side when he began the 14-year process of turning Barclays' defunct investment bank, BZW, into what was to become Barclays Capital. Ricci was in New York when Diamond failed to save the ailing US bank Lehman Brothers from bankruptcy in September 2008 \u2013 only to then take control of the Wall Street operations of the collapsed bank days later. Along with Jerry del Missier, who also quit in the frenetic days after the Libor crisis, the trio drove fast-paced growth which generated racy returns. The review into the culture of Barclays by City lawyer Anthony Salz found that a long-term incentive plan paid \u00a3170m a year between 2002 and 2009 to 60 top investment bankers, whom he did not identify. Since 2010, Ricci has been handed shares worth \u00a370m or so from long-term plans dating back five years \u2013 on top of a salary of around \u00a3700,000 \u2013 and will have taken out millions more in preceding years. The 2011 Sunday Times Rich List estimated he had a \u00a354m fortune. The bank announced that Ricci had sold the entirety of the \u00a317.6m shares he had been handed from past bonus schemes on the day of the budget last month, drawing accusations that the bank was attempting to bury bad news. That sale did not help to burnish the image of Ricci, who despite his portrayal as a brash City figure is neither a deal broker nor a trader but an administrator \u2013 more of a chief operating officer than a risk taker. He has been seen walking through Canary Wharf, china mug in hand, and buying a lottery ticket. After Diamond and Del Missier quit, Ricci made efforts to stay. He began Project Mango, a scrutiny of the 54 business activities inside the investment bank that led to a pledge to shut down the structured capital markets tax avoidance unit. Just days after Jenkins was appointed to the helm of Barclays, at the end of August 2012, Ricci was making speeches alongside the new boss, pledging to lead the clean-up inside the bank \u2013 although he was not there in February when Jenkins made his set-piece presentation about how he intended to turn things around. Ricci refuses to tell even close colleagues many details about his background, other than to say he was educated in Nebraska at a Jesuit school and worked at a number of small US banks before joining what was then BZW in 1994. His British wife Susannah is technically the owner of Fatcatinthehat \u2013 apparently taken from a newpaper headline \u2013 and the rest of the horses appear to be registered in her name. As well as Champagne Fever, she owns another horse called Blackstairmountain, which won almost \u00a3500,000 in prize money last week. The couple are reported to have put their seven-bedroom Kent home on the market for \u00a31m \u2013 a sum that might seem modest to rivals, particularly in the light of his multimillion-pound rewards which to the astonishment of some could keep flowing for a few more years yet, despite his early retirement.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dairy Crest, the producer of Cathedral City cheese, has taken an unusual step to protect its pension fund and further reduce its deficit, signing over its maturing cheddar inventory to the retirement scheme. Taking moves among many UK companies struggling with pension deficits to another level, Dairy Crest said it had granted a floating charge over \u00a360m worth of its cheddar cheese stock, valued at \u00a3150m at the end of March. The milk processor, whose other brands include Country Life, Clover and flavoured milk drink Frijj, will also make a one-off \u00a340m cash contribution to plug its pension fund deficit. The company said the move meant that, if it became insolvent, the pension fund could sell the cheese stock to pay its pensioners an income. \"If a company has valuable assets that are not pledged to a bank, why not pledge them to their pension scheme if that means they don't have to put their hands in their pockets to put large amounts of cash into their retirement scheme,\" said Charles Cowling, managing director at JLT Pension Capital Strategies. Dairy Crest's 3,000-member pension scheme had a deficit of \u00a384m in September 2012. The final salary scheme was closed to new members in 2006 and future accruals from existing members were ended in 2010. Pension funds are struggling to cope with extra costs from people living longer in retirement and are also finding it tough to generate adequate returns in volatile markets since the financial crisis of 2008. Dairy Crest will use some of the proceeds from the sale of its French branded spreads business, St Hubert, towards the cash payment to the pension fund. The sale fetched \u20ac430m last year when Montagu Private Equity SAS acquired the firm . The company has been working to reduce its pension deficit over the last five years. It closed its final salary linked pension scheme to new members in 2010 and completed a \u00a3300m bulk annuity deal in 2009, in which it exchanged UK gilts for an insurance policy to cover a portion of the pension liabilities. It also makes annual contributions of \u00a320m to its pension scheme to reduce the shortfall. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 April 2013 to correct details of the transaction and the state of the pension deficit after the agency ran corrections.",

      "body": "<p>Dairy Crest, the producer of Cathedral City cheese, has taken an unusual step to protect its pension fund and further reduce its deficit, signing over its maturing cheddar inventory to the retirement scheme.</p> <p>Taking moves among many UK companies struggling with pension deficits to another level, Dairy Crest said it had granted a floating charge over \u00a360m worth of its cheddar cheese stock, valued at \u00a3150m at the end of March.</p> <p>The milk processor, whose other brands include Country Life, Clover and flavoured milk drink Frijj, will also make a one-off \u00a340m cash contribution to plug its pension fund deficit.</p> <p>The company said the move meant that, if it became insolvent, the pension fund could sell the cheese stock to pay its pensioners an income.</p> <p>\"If a company has valuable assets that are not pledged to a bank, why not pledge them to their pension scheme if that means they don't have to put their hands in their pockets to put large amounts of cash into their retirement scheme,\" said Charles Cowling, managing director at JLT Pension Capital Strategies.</p> <p>Dairy Crest's 3,000-member pension scheme had a deficit of \u00a384m in September 2012. The final salary scheme was closed to new members in 2006 and future accruals from existing members were ended in 2010.</p> <p>Pension funds are struggling to cope with extra costs from people living longer in retirement and are also finding it tough to generate adequate returns in volatile markets since the financial crisis of 2008.</p> <p>Dairy Crest will use some of the proceeds from the sale of its French branded spreads business, St Hubert, towards the cash payment to the pension fund. The sale fetched \u20ac430m last year when Montagu Private Equity SAS acquired the firm .</p> <p>The company has been working to reduce its pension deficit over the last five years. It closed its final salary linked pension scheme to new members in 2010 and completed a \u00a3300m bulk annuity deal in 2009, in which it exchanged UK gilts for an insurance policy to cover a portion of the pension liabilities.</p> <p>It also makes annual contributions of \u00a320m to its pension scheme to reduce the shortfall.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 April 2013 to correct details of the transaction and the state of the pension deficit after the agency ran corrections.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Aviva, Britain's largest insurer, is set for a collision with unions after cutting 2,000 jobs worldwide and halving redundancy pay as it forces through cost savings.</p> <p>Mark Wilson, the chief executive, who took over in January after his predecessor, Andrew Moss, was ousted in a shareholder revolt, said the cuts would equate to 6% of Aviva's 31,200 workers globally. With 18,000 based in Aviva's home market, as many as 1,000 jobs could go in the UK.</p> <p>In a two-stage process, employees on UK contracts will have their redundancy payout cap reduced from 100 weeks to 78 weeks' salary. From 1 December, redundancy terms will halve from four to two weeks' salary for every year of service, as Aviva attempts to save \u00a3400m.</p> <p>Unite, Britain's biggest union, slammed the move as a \"callous and disgraceful act\", saying staff with more than 20 years' service could lose more than a quarter of their entitlement.</p> <p>Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: \"Finance staff are being forced to pay the price for boardroom failure.

      "bodyText": "Aviva, Britain's largest insurer, is set for a collision with unions after cutting 2,000 jobs worldwide and halving redundancy pay as it forces through cost savings. Mark Wilson, the chief executive, who took over in January after his predecessor, Andrew Moss, was ousted in a shareholder revolt, said the cuts would equate to 6% of Aviva's 31,200 workers globally. With 18,000 based in Aviva's home market, as many as 1,000 jobs could go in the UK. In a two-stage process, employees on UK contracts will have their redundancy payout cap reduced from 100 weeks to 78 weeks' salary. From 1 December, redundancy terms will halve from four to two weeks' salary for every year of service, as Aviva attempts to save \u00a3400m. Unite, Britain's biggest union, slammed the move as a \"callous and disgraceful act\", saying staff with more than 20 years' service could lose more than a quarter of their entitlement. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: \"Finance staff are being forced to pay the price for boardroom failure. The UK workforce, which is the backbone of the company, has suffered job cuts, pay freezes and now faces an attack on their redundancy terms, when the company is planning more cuts.\" Unite said workers would have to consider how they wanted to oppose the cuts, but that it would give its members every support. Aviva axed 3,000 jobs in 2012, with 800 lost among the UK workforce. \"I know this is difficult news for our employees but these changes are essential if we are to remain competitive,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Aviva needs to become a more efficient and agile organisation to unlock its potential.

The 2012 dividend was slashed by more than a quarter in March to repay debt, as the company reported a 15% drop in operating profit to \u00a32.13bn. \"(\"[It's] sad news for those affected but Aviva needs to become more competitive,\" Barrie Cornes, a Panmure Gordon analyst, told Reuters. \"We would anticipate that a significant number of the 2,000 job losses will be lost from the UK, given its significant market share here.\"",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The fact that economics spits out cold, hard numbers doesn't mean it produces the cold, hard truth", 
      "body": "<p>In economics, there are no heroes. Let's repeat that: there are no heroes. </p> <p>We want heroes. We want to be told what is right by philosopher-data-kings, poring over numbers that will point us toward the right policies and ways of thinking. When we want to address inequality \u2013 like raising the minimum wage or paying women an equal amount, or giving immigrants a chance to contribute to society, or paying CEOs less \u2013 economics helps bolster those arguments. To a certain extent, the numbers created by the magi of the economy have been our beacons through the recession and the slow recovery. We look to the wise men (and women, but mostly men) who will lead us out of the wilderness, their white robes printed with numbers: GDP, unemployment, inflation. These numbers are our mile markers: how much is life improving for people? Can they afford food? How much further does the economy have to go to recovery? </p> <p>We are, largely, fools when we do this. Economics is an inexact science, as any honest economist will tell you. It is based on unreliable numbers that measure relatively small swaths of the population. Whatever the number \u2013 unemployment, inflation, wages \u2013 it is almost always wrong the first time the government publishes them, and then it is revised later: once, twice, three times or more. The errors are usually large. </p> <p>This is an important realization <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/16/unemployment-reinhart-rogoff-arithmetic-cause\">because of what happened this week</a>. Many Americans know that Washington lawmakers have been engaged in a two-year battle to the death over the federal deficit. Some, like Congressman Paul Ryan, say that the debt that America owes will destroy the economy in the future. Others, mostly Democrats, say it is foolish to cut government debt \u2013 and thus government spending \u2013 because Americans need the wages and support that come from Washington, at least until things get better. </p> <p>This philosophical debate is not actually about philosophy. It has been, to a certain extent, about two activist economists who spent years preaching that high debt would destroy America's economy in the future, pitching us into certain recession. Here's how it happened: </p> <p>In 2011 Congress was engaged in a bitter battle over the direction of the US economy; a group of them seemed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/14/us-debt-ceiling-deadlock-questions-and-answers\">ready to default on the nation's debt</a> and shut down the government, if necessary, to win their point: that the growing federal deficit would endanger America's economy for generations to come. Others were unconvinced. The stalemate brought Washington to a standstill on the issue. </p> <p>During this tense period, there was an important meeting. Nearly 40 Senators sat in neat rows to hear a presentation on debt from Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff, two economists with faultless reputations and keen academic credentials. They were not just economists that day, however, bolstered by years of research and a 900-pound book full of graphs and complex economic data, <a href=\"http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/researchers-finally-replicated-reinhart-rogoff-and-there-are-serious-problems#.UW147o4A23o.twitter\">Reinhart and Rogoff were also activists against debt</a>. Their goal was to convince the assembled lawmakers to cut the amount of money the government owed. </p> <p>The data from Reinhart and Rogoff showed that if the national debt became equivalent to 90% of the US gross domestic product, the US would suffer low growth and all that comes with it: unemployment, malaise, poverty. Reinhart and Rogoff had faultless authority; in 2009, they had published a 900-page doorstopper of a book full of graphs and charts dryly titled <a href=\"http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/\">This Time It's Different</a>. </p> <p>Reinhart and Rogoff wrote in the introduction: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"What is certainly clear is that again and again, countries, banks, individuals, and firms take on ex\u00adcessive debt in good times without enough awareness of the risks that will follow when the inevitable recession hits. The fact that basic data on domestic debt are so opaque and dif\u00adficult to obtain is proof that governments will go to great lengths to hide their books when things are going wrong, just as financial insti\u00adtutions have done in the contemporary financial crisis.</p> <p>We hope that the weight of evidence in this book will give future policy makers and investors a bit more pause before next they declare, 'This time is different.' It almost never is.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>That anti-debt message was what occasioned their trip to Washington. Rogoff and Reinhart were there to encourage the lawmakers to cut the deficit at any cost, including severe government downsizing. The implication of their presentation was clear: if you think this economy is bad, if you're already hearing from your jobless constituents, wait until you've been suffering through it for 10 more years or more. One can picture the thought bubbles above the senators' heads: they could likely not help but be concerned about their ability to make the right decisions about the economy and hold office if they didn't cut debt. </p> <p>Rogoff and Reinhart were not there to just present their conclusions; they were there to lobby for them. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, who was there, <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/whats-truly-radical-is-the-status-quo/article/495526\">described the scene and the conversation</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"A key conclusion of [Rogoff and Reinhart's work] is that economies like ours slow down considerably when our debt-to-GDP ratio reaches about 90% (we are now at debt-to-GDP ratio of 100%).<br>Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia and always a gentleman, stood up to ask his question: 'Do we need to act this year?

      "bodyText": "In economics, there are no heroes. Let's repeat that: there are no heroes. We want heroes. We want to be told what is right by philosopher-data-kings, poring over numbers that will point us toward the right policies and ways of thinking. When we want to address inequality \u2013 like raising the minimum wage or paying women an equal amount, or giving immigrants a chance to contribute to society, or paying CEOs less \u2013 economics helps bolster those arguments. To a certain extent, the numbers created by the magi of the economy have been our beacons through the recession and the slow recovery. We look to the wise men (and women, but mostly men) who will lead us out of the wilderness, their white robes printed with numbers: GDP, unemployment, inflation. These numbers are our mile markers: how much is life improving for people? Can they afford food? How much further does the economy have to go to recovery? We are, largely, fools when we do this. Economics is an inexact science, as any honest economist will tell you. It is based on unreliable numbers that measure relatively small swaths of the population. Whatever the number \u2013 unemployment, inflation, wages \u2013 it is almost always wrong the first time the government publishes them, and then it is revised later: once, twice, three times or more. The errors are usually large. This is an important realization because of what happened this week. Many Americans know that Washington lawmakers have been engaged in a two-year battle to the death over the federal deficit. Some, like Congressman Paul Ryan, say that the debt that America owes will destroy the economy in the future. Others, mostly Democrats, say it is foolish to cut government debt \u2013 and thus government spending \u2013 because Americans need the wages and support that come from Washington, at least until things get better. This philosophical debate is not actually about philosophy. It has been, to a certain extent, about two activist economists who spent years preaching that high debt would destroy America's economy in the future, pitching us into certain recession. Here's how it happened: In 2011 Congress was engaged in a bitter battle over the direction of the US economy; a group of them seemed ready to default on the nation's debt and shut down the government, if necessary, to win their point: that the growing federal deficit would endanger America's economy for generations to come. Others were unconvinced. The stalemate brought Washington to a standstill on the issue. During this tense period, there was an important meeting. Nearly 40 Senators sat in neat rows to hear a presentation on debt from Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff, two economists with faultless reputations and keen academic credentials. They were not just economists that day, however, bolstered by years of research and a 900-pound book full of graphs and complex economic data, Reinhart and Rogoff were also activists against debt. Their goal was to convince the assembled lawmakers to cut the amount of money the government owed. The data from Reinhart and Rogoff showed that if the national debt became equivalent to 90% of the US gross domestic product, the US would suffer low growth and all that comes with it: unemployment, malaise, poverty. Reinhart and Rogoff had faultless authority; in 2009, they had published a 900-page doorstopper of a book full of graphs and charts dryly titled This Time It's Different. Reinhart and Rogoff wrote in the introduction: \"What is certainly clear is that again and again, countries, banks, individuals, and firms take on excessive debt in good times without enough awareness of the risks that will follow when the inevitable recession hits. The fact that basic data on domestic debt are so opaque and difficult to obtain is proof that governments will go to great lengths to hide their books when things are going wrong, just as financial institutions have done in the contemporary financial crisis. We hope that the weight of evidence in this book will give future policy makers and investors a bit more pause before next they declare, 'This time is different.' It almost never is.\" That anti-debt message was what occasioned their trip to Washington. Rogoff and Reinhart were there to encourage the lawmakers to cut the deficit at any cost, including severe government downsizing. The implication of their presentation was clear: if you think this economy is bad, if you're already hearing from your jobless constituents, wait until you've been suffering through it for 10 more years or more. One can picture the thought bubbles above the senators' heads: they could likely not help but be concerned about their ability to make the right decisions about the economy and hold office if they didn't cut debt. Rogoff and Reinhart were not there to just present their conclusions; they were there to lobby for them. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, who was there, described the scene and the conversation: \"A key conclusion of [Rogoff and Reinhart's work] is that economies like ours slow down considerably when our debt-to-GDP ratio reaches about 90% (we are now at debt-to-GDP ratio of 100%). Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia and always a gentleman, stood up to ask his question: 'Do we need to act this year? Is it better to act quickly?' 'Absolutely,' Rogoff said. 'Not acting moves the risk closer,' he explained, because every year of not acting adds another year of debt accumulation. 'You have very few levers at this point,\" he warned us.'\" Even the skeptical lawmakers couldn't help but take this warning seriously, Coburn indicated. Their moods shifted, indicating deep worry, as Coburn tells it: \"'Thank you for your depressing presentation,' Senator Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said in closing, to self-conscious laughter around the room.\" Coburn himself was so convinced that he became a leader of the anti-debt movement in Congress.

      "body": "<h2>UK stores<br></h2> <p>As the UK's biggest supermarket, Tesco is struggling to find new avenues for growth on home turf. Shoppers are no longer keen on the large hypermarkets that Tesco has done so much to develop, so it was forced to write off \u00a3804m of property assets and admit that nearly half of its long-famed pipeline of development land was now surplus to requirements. Profits slid 8.3% in the UK last year as Tesco focused on opening its local convenience stores and tried to tempt shoppers back to its biggest outlets with price cuts and investment in warmer, brighter interiors. This year it plans up to 160 new convenience stores and will continue to revamp bigger stores after years of under-investment, partly with the help of eateries such as recent acquisition Giraffe and coffee chain Harris + Hoole.</p> <h2>Online<br></h2> <p>The internet is important to Tesco as one of the few areas of retail enjoying rapid growth. Online grocery sales rose 12.8% to \u00a33.2bn last year and Philip Clarke was keen to stress how important a multi-channel presence is for the business. Tesco now has five \"dark stores\", where employees assemble customers' online orders, to serve its web business. A sixth opens later this year. However, the non-food website Tesco Direct suffered as sales of electrical products were squeezed by competition from the likes of Amazon, while Clarke admitted that Tesco's in-store displays of electricals were not up to scratch.</p> <h2>Bank<br></h2> <p>Tesco began trialling banks in its stores in 2006 and said it hoped to offer current accounts from 2009. It has since expanded into mortgages, insurance and credit cards, but the current account is not set to arrive until 2014. Meanwhile, revenues at the bank slid 2.2% to \u00a31bn and profits dived 15.1% last year as Tesco took a \u00a3115m hit from PPI mis-selling.</p> <h2>Tesco's overseas ventures</h2> <h2>China</h2> <p><strong>Launched 2004</strong></p> <p><strong>Number of stores: 131( incl 117 hypermarkets) </strong></p> <p><strong>Revenues: \u00a31.4bn</strong></p> <p>Three years ago Tesco said it wanted to open 80 shopping mall developments in China by 2016, amounting to 40m sq ft of floorspace- bigger than its UK estate.

      "bodyText": "UK stores As the UK's biggest supermarket, Tesco is struggling to find new avenues for growth on home turf. Shoppers are no longer keen on the large hypermarkets that Tesco has done so much to develop, so it was forced to write off \u00a3804m of property assets and admit that nearly half of its long-famed pipeline of development land was now surplus to requirements. Profits slid 8.3% in the UK last year as Tesco focused on opening its local convenience stores and tried to tempt shoppers back to its biggest outlets with price cuts and investment in warmer, brighter interiors. This year it plans up to 160 new convenience stores and will continue to revamp bigger stores after years of under-investment, partly with the help of eateries such as recent acquisition Giraffe and coffee chain Harris + Hoole. Online The internet is important to Tesco as one of the few areas of retail enjoying rapid growth. Online grocery sales rose 12.8% to \u00a33.2bn last year and Philip Clarke was keen to stress how important a multi-channel presence is for the business. Tesco now has five \"dark stores\", where employees assemble customers' online orders, to serve its web business. A sixth opens later this year. However, the non-food website Tesco Direct suffered as sales of electrical products were squeezed by competition from the likes of Amazon, while Clarke admitted that Tesco's in-store displays of electricals were not up to scratch. Bank Tesco began trialling banks in its stores in 2006 and said it hoped to offer current accounts from 2009. It has since expanded into mortgages, insurance and credit cards, but the current account is not set to arrive until 2014. Meanwhile, revenues at the bank slid 2.2% to \u00a31bn and profits dived 15.1% last year as Tesco took a \u00a3115m hit from PPI mis-selling. Tesco's overseas ventures China Launched 2004 Number of stores: 131( incl 117 hypermarkets) Revenues: \u00a31.4bn Three years ago Tesco said it wanted to open 80 shopping mall developments in China by 2016, amounting to 40m sq ft of floorspace- bigger than its UK estate. Today it has just over 10m sq ft and recently announced the closure of five under-performing hypermarkets.Its plan for shopping malls has not proved as popular as it hoped and it aims to \"refocus on a more profitable approach\" in the country. Still, China remains \"strategically important\" to Tesco.

The creditors and debtors had a problem with one another, and now there seems to be a possibility to use the tax-payers money of other countries for it. It seems a relief for those investors who were afraid of not getting their money back, but what they did not take into account that the left in Europe and particularly also the German left, is very nervous about this. As much as they endorse rescuing countries who are in trouble, they are not willing to accept rescuing creditors of banks better known as Russian oligarchs.</p> <p>And this has implied the turnaround in the German public mood, and the German government now had to react because if they would have brought a kind of solution like in Ireland to the parliament...the parliament would not have accepted it because the opposition would simply be against it and their own majority for such a delicate decision is not there.</p> <p>So the German government had to come up with a different solution.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sinn</strong> also argued that it was \"politically impossible\" for Italy to make the reforms needed to close the competitiveness gap with Germany, and remained convinced that Greece should quit the eurozone:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have long advised Greece to leave the Euro because their path towards competitiveness through cuts and wages in prices is so long that if you try it you put too much pressure on the labour market and the domestic population.</p> <p>People can\u2019t stand such enormous austerity programs and it would be a disaster, I think.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-04-18T13:46:37.337Z\">at 2.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-516fe9b2e4b0b434f8243dc3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-18T12:40:18.460Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How big is the Cyprus aid package anyway?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>First the Cyprus bailout was&#xa0;<strong>\u20ac17bn,</strong> then it swelled to <strong>\u20ac23bn</strong>.

Most investors are choosing to downplay idiosyncratic risks in Spain, of which there are too many to list, and treat the market as a high-return, as opposed to a high-risk, one. Today's well received auction, with a further drop in yields and robust demand, underscores the extent to which peripheral eurozone debt markets are almost immune from growing concerns about economic growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Complacency is wearing thin, though, Spiro adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets have become more sensitive to the deterioration in the global growth outlook of late which suggests that economic fundamentals are starting to come into focus. This recent shift in sentiment is likely to seep into Spanish and Italian bond markets. Yet, as we have been arguing for some time, the bar for a sharp and sustained sell-off in Spanish and Italian debt has risen significantly since last July.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. Here's a closing summary. \u2022 The German parliament has approved Cyprus's bailout package, bringing the aid deal a step closer. 487 MPs voted in favour, with just 102 opposing the plan. We have highlights from 8.21am. \u2022 During the debate, finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told the Bundestag that it was vital to rescue Cyprus, or risk contagion spreading across the eurozone. Opposition MPs, though, criticised Sch\u00e4uble for the panic caused by the original decision to tax all savers. \u2022 Cyprus's parliament is also expected to vote on the deal, which could be another hurdle. Insiders say this could happen after 26 April, when the package has been approved by the various eurozone governments (see 2.59pm). Government MPs say Cyprus is certain to ratify the plan, but opposition members are less convinced.... \u2022 Christine Lagarde of the IMF has put more pressure on the UK to change its austerity programme, warning that growth did not look very impressive. She also called for Spain to be allowed to relax its fiscal plans (see 3.59pm onwards). \u2022 An EC commissioner has demanded action over the shooting of a group of migrant workers in Greece who asked for their unpaid wages. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European commissioner for home affairs, said authorities must hold a full inquiry, as a consumer boycott was organised. (see 4.49pm). \u2022 Italian MPs failed to choose a new president. Two rounds of voting failed to produce a winner, meaning a third (and probably a fourth) ballot tomorrow (see 5.47pm). \u2022 The Netherlands has been sucked deeper into the eurozone downturn, as its unemployment rate jumped last month (see 9.26am). I'll be back tomorrow -- Thanks, and goodnight! G The second round of voting for the next Italian president has just finished without a winner. A third round will take place tomorrow. The vote had a farcical element, with some MPs voting for joke candidates such as football managers and, err, Mussolini. Many others cast blank votes - suggesting that the real action will take place in the fourth round when the margin of victory is lowered. Lizzy Davies reports from Rome: Ed Conway of Sky News appears to have clean-bowled the next governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, over in Washington with a question about interest rate guidance. I fear Mr Conway will not be invited to open the bowling at Carney's first press conference in London. Reuters has also collected the best Carney's quotes online, here. It was a much calmer day on Europe's stock markets. Here's the closing prices, including two indices that finished the day where they began: FTSE 100: down 0.5 points at 6243, - 0.01% German DAX: down 29 points at 7473, - 0.39% French CAC: flat at 3599 points Spanish IBEX: up 9 points at 7812, + 0.12% Italian FTSE MIB: up 96 points at 15480, + 0.6% Markets had been higher earlier in the day, before weak US economic data (details here) was released. Chris Beauchamp of IG explained: An absence of major European news meant that markets were content to rise during the morning, but once again the US has determined the overall direction Here's a video clip of Christine Lagarde talking about the global economy today on Bloomberg TV, explaining that she is 'desperately optimistic' about the situation. Here's what Lagarde said about Europe's austerity programme: Most of them have to do some fiscal consolidation because they are heavily indebted and because they have and they are running and they have been running large deficits. But it\u2019s a question of how much and how quickly. And for some of them, there is no reason to rush into upfront, heavily-loaded fiscal consolidation. Look at the Netherlands, for instance. They just decided, and I think they rightly did so, to reduce the pace, to continue to do it, but to allow a bit of time in order to let growth prosper, which is clearly needed and makes fiscal consolidation much easier. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, is calling for a full inquiry after 20 migrant fruit pickers in Greece were shot over a pay dispute yesterday. The strawberry pickers from Bangladesh were wounded when around 200 workers asked for their unpaid wages, which apparently date back six months. A supervisor opened fire on them with a shotgun, according to police captain Haralambos Sfetsos (more details here). Two arrests have reportedly been made, and Malmstr\u00f6m wants a proper investigation into the incident. A campaign has also been launched against the region where the strawberry pickers worked, a village called Manolada. Christine Lagarde also told the press conference in Washington that Spain should be allowed to relax its austerity programme - as its economy is simply too weak. Reuters has the quotes: We believe, considering the situation of the country and the efforts that had been undertaken, the 25% unemployment rate at the moment, (that) it's clearly needed to do fiscal consolidation but we don't see the need to do upfront, heavy duty fiscal consolidation as was initially planned. Spain needs more time and needs to be able to adjust into its fiscal consolidation efforts... This graph, from its latest report, shows how the Spanish reform programme has gone off track. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, has intensified the pressure on the UK government to consider relaxing its austerity programme. Speaking at the IMF's spring conference in Washington, Lagarde cited the weak nature of the UK economy. She also appeared to nudge the European Central Bank, saying it was the only central bank with the room to ease policy much further. From Washington, Larry Elliott reports: Lagarde said it had always been Fund's position that consideration be given to slowing pace of deficit reduction programme if growth should abate. \"The growth numbers are certainly not particularly good,\" she added. Britain's economy actually shrank in the last three months of 2012. We'll get the first estimate for the first quarter of this year in a week's time. The Telegraph's Phil Aldrick suggests the IMF might push George Osborne to relax his programme soon: Back to the upcoming vote in Cyprus: Helena Smith reports that news is coming in that the government will probably wait until after 26 April to hold the ballot to ratify its bailout. Helena has been speaking to MPs in Cyprus today. One government member is adamant that the parliament will approve the bailout, but an opposition MP is less convinced \u2026 (as explained at 12.07pm, it appears Cypriot lawmakers need to give their approval for the package) Helena writes: Insiders say that president Nicos Anastasiades\u2019 governing coalition would prefer to hold the vote after April 26, once European parliaments have ratified the rescue programme. Party leaders were informed of the government\u2019s plans this morning although it is far from assured whether this will remain the case. Some bills are expected to be discussed by the 56-member House this afternoon. MPs are expressing varying degrees of confidence as to whether the \u20ac10bn package will be passed. Anti-austerity forces, including the communist party Akel and socialist party Edek, are almost sure to vote it down. Marios Mavrides, an MP with the ruling centre-right Dysi party, told me he was sure the bailout would be endorsed. \u201cThere is no way it won\u2019t pass because if we don\u2019t vote for it, we won\u2019t be able to pay [public sector] employees at the end of the month,\u201d he said. \u201cAkel and Edek will only vote against it if they know that ultimately it will pass,\u201d he insisted before adding \u201cevery international agreement has to be ratified by the parliament. Everyone should have known that the vote was going to take place.\u201d The government, he said, would have a waifer thin majority of one [i.e. 29 votes] if it also got the support of a former DIKO MP now sitting as an independent in the house. But the small hardline EUROKO party, which has two seats in the house, expressed reservations. Much would depend on regulations and adjustments that were made to bills, said a senior Euroko aide. \u201cI am not at all confident it will pass. We all know what the consequences will be. If we don\u2019t vote, we won\u2019t get the money but if we do, it is just as bad as it will forever throw Cyprus into the troika\u2019s net,\u201d Andreas Kyprezoglou told me from the island. \u201cMPs haven\u2019t made their minds up. In house of parliament proceedings, bills go through three readings before they are enacted as a law and experience has shown already that a lot can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a question of a simple yes or no in a plenary session. There is going to be a lot of debate around regulations and amendments which will play a very important role.\" One of Germany's most senior economists has argued that the Cypriot rescue deal, with its \"bailing-in\" of wealthy depositors, is part of a significant change in the German approach to the euro crisis. Hans-Werner Sinn, who is the president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, made the comments in an interview with Open Europe, published this morning. He explained that last summer's decision to use bailout funds to recapitalise banks (a plan which now appears to be gathering dust), had helped persuade many German politicians that investors and large depositors, not taxpayers, should fund rescues in future. Leftwing German politicians are particularly opposed to taxpayers footing the bill, Sinn said, suggesting that Ireland's fateful decision to take its failing banks on the public books would never have won approval in the Bundestag. Here's a video clip of the interview (which is also online here): And here's the key quotes: I think the change in attitude was provoked by the decision of the EU in London last June to recapitalize the banks if necessary with the ESM-money [the European Stability Mechanism]. That decision, taken late in the night seemed to be for many the solution. The creditors and debtors had a problem with one another, and now there seems to be a possibility to use the tax-payers money of other countries for it. It seems a relief for those investors who were afraid of not getting their money back, but what they did not take into account that the left in Europe and particularly also the German left, is very nervous about this. As much as they endorse rescuing countries who are in trouble, they are not willing to accept rescuing creditors of banks better known as Russian oligarchs. And this has implied the turnaround in the German public mood, and the German government now had to react because if they would have brought a kind of solution like in Ireland to the parliament...the parliament would not have accepted it because the opposition would simply be against it and their own majority for such a delicate decision is not there. So the German government had to come up with a different solution. Sinn also argued that it was \"politically impossible\" for Italy to make the reforms needed to close the competitiveness gap with Germany, and remained convinced that Greece should quit the eurozone: I have long advised Greece to leave the Euro because their path towards competitiveness through cuts and wages in prices is so long that if you try it you put too much pressure on the labour market and the domestic population. People can\u2019t stand such enormous austerity programs and it would be a disaster, I think. First the Cyprus bailout was \u20ac17bn, then it swelled to \u20ac23bn. Then top eurocrats criticised the press for writing about leaked documents (sorry, Olli, but we were in good company). So, how big is it? The FT's Peter Spiegel reckons that the correct answer may be \u20ac20.6bn, having carefully scrutinised all the documents available. But it's worryingly unclear. It was Spiegel who helpfully published the leaked Debt Sustainability Analysis work on Cyprus (which included the \u20ac23bn figure) earlier this month. He took another look yesterday, after commissioner Olli Rehn claimed that reporters \"have been comparing apples with pears and coming up with oranges\". Those leaked documents (pdf) clearly showed a \u20ac6bn increase in the programme, which all falls on Cyprus. But it now appears that certain items shouldn't really be counted as they actually cut the country's debt burden (eg: the controversial gold sale will help to lower Cyprus's borrowing costs.) Spiegel writes: The \u201cbaseline \u2013 full bailout\u201d assumptions going into the deliberations were that the total cost of the bailout would be \u20ac16.7bn, broken down this way: \u20ac8.9bn to recapitalise Cyprus\u2019 banks \u20ac1.1bn to recapitalise its cooperatives \u20ac1.8bn to finance the Cypriot government over the course of the three-year programme \u20ac4.9bn to pay off bonds that come due during the programme Or, to put it more simply: \u20ac6.7bn to run the Cypriot government and \u20ac10bn to shore up its faltering banks. A close reading of the European Commission\u2019s assessment of financing needs for Cyprus after the agreement looks like this: \u20ac10.6bn to wind-down or restructure Cyprus\u2019 two largest banks \u20ac2.5bn to recapitalise cooperatives and small banks \u20ac3.4bn to finance the Cypriot government \u20ac4.1bn to pay off bonds that come due during the programme Or, to put it more simply: \u20ac7.5bn to run the Cypriot government and \u20ac13.1bn for its banks. Add that up and you get \u20ac20.6bn, not the \u20ac23bn contained in the ESM document. The full piece is here. This confusion didn't cause much alarm in the Bundestag this morning, as German MPs voted in favour of the plan. After all, the international lenders' contribution remains at \u20ac10bn. Cypriot MPs, though, may demand answers..... If two-thirds of Italian MPs can't agree on a new president at the next two votes, then the fourth ballot will take place at which a clear majority is enough for victory. That's why Franco Marini isn't out of the reckoning, despite failing to win at the first vote (see 1pm) Although... history is against him: The Italian parliament has just failed to elect a new president at their first round of voting today. Former senate chief Franco Marini didn't win the support of two-thirds of MPs - the threshold for victory. He had appeared to be the frontrunner, after the centre-left Democratic party and the rightwing People of Freedom party had both backed him. A new vote will take place his afternoon. Our southern Europe editor, John Hooper, believes that a Marini victory (which is still possible at a future vote) could actually benefit the radical Five Star Movement: A couple of photos from the German vote - showing Angela Merkel in cheerful spirits: Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, has confirmed that officials in the Cyprus parliament expected to hold their own vote on the bailout deal, at some stage soon. This potentially adds an extra hurdle to the rescue, as the Cypriot parliament sensationally rejected the original plan last month. That vote helped to force a rethink, including abandoning the idea of taxing all savers in favour of a haircut on those with over \u20ac100,000 in the country's two largest banks. It's not clear when the vote will come, though: Helena writes: Government officials in Nicosia are ruling out the 56-seat House voting on the \u20ac10bn euro rescue programme today. One official, who had been in contact with the parliament about the issue, said MPs would need to study and debate the package before the ballot took place. \"As it is nobody has been given an official version yet so how could the vote take place?,\" she said. \"Right now we have no idea when it will take place but for sure it won't be today.\" Meanwhile, the anti-austerity front grows with deepening opposition to a haircut that increasing numbers say resembles more of a scalping. Cadres in the main opposition communist AKEL party are telling me that \"every avenue, every alternative to the memorandum and Troika has to be studied.\" Earlier this week Cyprus's attorney general declared that the bailout plan would need parliamentary approval to become valid (details here) Last night the Green party's only MP, George Perdikis, announced that he would vote against ratifying the bailout. Perdikis declared: It is, in my opinion, a crime and wrong to deliver Cyprus into the hands of the troika and allow it to become a colony. (more details here) Here are some of the key quotes from the Bundestag debate: Finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble: Step by step we are winning back confidence. If you look at the markets, there is still nervousness and uncertainty. But it is considerably less than three years, two years or one year ago. The aid for Cyprus secures the successes we've already achieved in the euro zone. We must prevent the problems in Cyprus from unleashing new problems in other euro zone countries. Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the opposition SPD, on the original plan to tax all savers in Cyprus: Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, whether you asked for this or simply joined others in supporting it, it was a huge mistake. It stoked fear and insecurity in Europe. German MPs have also approved extending the maturity on Irish bailout loans, by a similarly wide margin. The size of the majority - with 487 German MPs in favour of the Cyprus plan and just 102 against - should please Angela Merkel. Opinion polls have found widespread approval of the chancellor's handling of the crisis, particularly the Cypriot bailout. A poll conducted in Germany at the start of April found that almost two-thirds of the population thought Merkel had \"acted correctly and decisively in the euro crisis\". Only 33% thought that the German government thought too little about the wellbeing of people in crisis-hit countries as it works to rescue the euro. More details here. The Bundestag has approved the bailout of Cyprus. A total of 487 German MPs backed the package, with just 102 against. There were also 13 abstentions. Voting is underway in the Bundestag now \u2026 France's record low borrowing costs at today's debt auction comes a day after president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said it would take longer than planned to get the country's deficit below 3% of GDP. Clearly bond traders aren't worried - and probably actually welcome the news that Paris is prioritising growth over deficit reduction Gr\u00e1inne McCarthy of the WSJ comments: Here's some reaction to this morning's successful Spanish bond auction (details here), from Nick Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy: Despite the distinctly softer tone in global equity markets, peripheral eurozone debt markets remain remarkably resilient. As the \"hunt for yield\" continues unabated, Spanish and Italian bonds have been in something of a sweet spot for several months, benefiting from the higher carry, the perceived credibility of the ECB's backstop and, most recently, the sentiment-boosting policy actions of the Bank of Japan. Most investors are choosing to downplay idiosyncratic risks in Spain, of which there are too many to list, and treat the market as a high-return, as opposed to a high-risk, one. Today's well received auction, with a further drop in yields and robust demand, underscores the extent to which peripheral eurozone debt markets are almost immune from growing concerns about economic growth. Complacency is wearing thin, though, Spiro adds: Markets have become more sensitive to the deterioration in the global growth outlook of late which suggests that economic fundamentals are starting to come into focus. This recent shift in sentiment is likely to seep into Spanish and Italian bond markets. Yet, as we have been arguing for some time, the bar for a sharp and sustained sell-off in Spanish and Italian debt has risen significantly since last July. Country-specific risk remains a weak determinant of Spanish and Italian spreads. Back in the Bundestag - Carsten Schneider of the opposition SPD party has apparently argued that shareholders in European banks should provide some funding towards a fund to cover failed banks. Open Europe's Pawel Swidlicki got the quotes: The FT's James Mackintosh isn't impressed. But the plan does seem in line with the SPD's policy of removing the \"implicit guarantee\" that taxpayers will rescue banks (see more details here). France, meanwhile, just auctioned five- year bonds at a record low yield of just 0.73%. Reassuring for Paris, but also a sign that money is pouring into sovereign debt as central banks around the world ease monetary policy. Yesterday, the IMF warned of the risk that quantitative easing and ultra-low interest rates are fueling the next asset bubble. Some good news for Spain - it just sold around \u20ac4.7bn of government debt at lower interest rates. The auction included \u20ac1.29bn of 10-year bonds (the key measure of sovereign risk) at an average yield of just 4.612%, down from 4.898% last time. That looks like Spain's lowest borrowing cost for 10 years since September 2010. Britain's retail sales took a nasty dip in March, falling by 0.7% month on month, according to data just released by the Office for National Statistics. The awful UK weather is being blamed, along with the wider economic problems (yesterday's unemployment data showed that the gap between real wages and rising prices had widened). New jobless data from the Netherlands shows that the country's labour market deteriorated sharply last month. The jobless rate in the Netherlands rose to 8.1% in March, on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 7.7% in February. Twelve months ago it was 5.9%. Gregor Gysi of the leftwing Linke MP was very critical of the Cyprus rescue and its impact on ordinary people such as teachers and pensioners, who will pay for a crisis they didn't cause. Gysi also tells the Bundestag that Cyprus's own MPs have yet to give their approval for the plan. We should wait and see what they decide, he suggests. This follows reports that the Cypriot parliament will vote on the bailout, which is a surprise. We're looking into it today, and CNBC has more details here. Gysi also blasts those responsible for the original bailout plan (which includes Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble) for \"confusing\" savers with the plan to tax all deposits. As well as the Cyprus package, German MPs are also considering the decision to extend some of Portugal and Ireland's bailout loans for another seven years. Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the SPD opposition speaks next, and seems to argue that while his party will back the Cyprus package, that does not mean it consents to the way Germany is handing the crisis. He also criticises Sch\u00e4uble for not mentioning the International Monetary Fund's latest forecasts (it now expects a 0.3% contraction in the eurozone this year). Sch\u00e4uble's final message to Germany is that the country would be worse off if it quit the euro and returned to the Deutschemark (a policy favoured by its newest political party, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland). The current youth unemployment levels in the euro area are \"catastrophic\", adds Sch\u00e4uble. Update: here's the full quote via Reuters: We must fight in particular the high levels of youth unemployment in a number of European countries It is a catastrophe if 30-40 percent of young people have no job in the long term. Few would argue that a jobless rate of 23.5% for young people (and 12% across the board) is indeed awful. The highest rates are in Greece and Spain (both enforcing the kinds of austerity programmes favoured by Berlin...) Sch\u00e4uble insists that there is \"no other sustainable course\" to repair the eurozone, other than by the current approach of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. The plan is \"beginning to bear fruit\", he adds. European Parliament Advisor Roderick Kefferputz isn't convinced: There's no chance of Cyprus being given more than \u20ac10bn in loans from the EU and the IMF, says Sch\u00e4uble. That's follows leaked documents earlier this month which suggested the total cost of the programme is now \u20ac23bn, not \u20ac17bn (although the situation is still unclear). There is a serious risk of contagion sweeping through Europe if Cyprus is not rescued, Sch\u00e4uble says, as he urges the Bundestag to back the package (as we expect them to do). Spain and Italy could both have been hit, he adds. MPs are giving Sch\u00e4uble a good reception - he's already won a couple of rounds of applause. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble opened the debate by telling the Bundestag that the situation in the eurozone had improved during 2013. The euro crisis is clearly causing less uncertainty in the financial markets than a few months ago, he argued. And Sch\u00e4uble insisted that Europe was right to bail out Cyprus, due the \"dramatic\" situation the island found itself. Without help, the Cypriot government would have defaulted on its loans, he warns, spreading more alarm through the eurozone and beyond. There's a live stream from the Bundestag here. Incidentally, before the Cyprus bailout was agreed there was a lot of concern in Germany that dubious Russian businesspeople might benefit from a rescue deal. Not any more, as euobserver points out: the issue of alleged money laundering by Cypriot banks - the number one topic in Germany ahead of the eurozone deal - seems to have been kicked into the long grass. Italian MPs will also be busy today, as they begin the process of electing a new president. Their choice could have serious consequences for the rest of the eurozone, as whoever succeeds Giorgio Napolitano must try to form a stable government. As my colleague Lizzy Davies wrote last night: It will be up to Napolitano's successor to see whether bickering politicians can be cajoled into forming a government or whether a return to the polls is the only way forward.... More here: Italian politicians go into conclave for crucial presidential election Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other events across the global economy. Cyprus is top of the agenda today, as MPs gather at the Reichstag building in Berlin to debate its bailout package. Finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble will open the debate at 8am BST (9am local time), with a vote taking place around 10am BST. The debate is likely to include heavy criticism of the way the plan was put together. MPs could also raise concerns that the growth projections in the programme are too optimistic. The Bundestag must give its approval before \u20ac10bn of EU/IMF loans can be extended to the Cypriot government, part of the package that was hammered out last month. The package is likely to be approved, as some opposition MPs have already indicated they will vote alongside Angela Merkel's government. Green MP Tobias Lindner said yesterday: ...everything indicates there will be a large majority on Thursday. Lindner added that there is likely to be lengthy questioning of how Cyprus's rising debts will be kept at \"sustainable\", given the damage caused to the country's economy in recent weeks. We'll be tracking events in the Bundestag this morning, and across Europe and beyond through the day \u2026",
