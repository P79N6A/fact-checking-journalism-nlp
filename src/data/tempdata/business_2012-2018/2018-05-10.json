      "bodyText": "Some of Britain\u2019s top-selling cars may have faulty and potentially lethal seatbelts, the Volkswagen Group has admitted. The rear-left seatbelt in Volkswagen Polos as well as two Seat brands, has a potentially dangerous fault, tests carried out by a Finnish car magazine found. Independent tests by the magazine, which were later confirmed by the manufacturer, found that when the cars are driven at speed and all three seat belts are in use, the rear left seatbelt can unfasten unexpectedly leaving the occupant unsecured. The fault affects the latest model of VW Polos, which last year were the 7th best-selling car in the UK, as well as the Seat Ibiza and Seat Arona. The VW Group, which owns all the brands, said it was aware of the fault and advised owners not to use the middle seatbelt until a solution to the problem is found and a recall can be carried out. The magazine Tekniikan Maailma found the problem occurred when the car was carrying five people and the driver made a high-speed lane change to the left. The tests found that when the body of the middle seat passenger shifted as the car turned a corner, it forced the higher-mounted buckle for the central seatbelt against the lower buckle for the outer left-hand side belt, pushing the release button of the latter. Tekniikan Maailma said this happened on numerous occasions in each identified model and that the \u201cunlatching is caused by a design fault\u201d. A spokesperson from the Volkswagen Group in Wolfsburg, Germany said: \u201cBased on the analysis made at our factory we have identified the seat belt issue that Tekniikan Maailma has found in the tests. \u201cAt Volkswagen, safety remains a main priority and we immediately reacted to solve the issue. As a consequence, a feasible technical solution has been identified. \u201cVolkswagen is now waiting for the concerned authorities\u2019 final validation in order to implement it, both on the customers\u2019 cars and on the future series production.\u201d The issue emerged just a day BMW recalled more than 300,000 cars in the UK because of an electrical fault that has caused some vehicles to cut out which was revealed by a BBC Watchdog Live investigation.",

      "bodyText": "The weaker-than-expected performance of the economy in early 2018 has forced the Bank of England to put back plans for an increase in interest rates until later this year. Although the Bank believes the soft patch in growth will prove temporary, seven of the nine members of its monetary policy committee (MPC) adopted a wait-and-see approach to raising official borrowing costs on Thursday, voting to keep them at 0.5%. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, said a rate rise was more likely than not before the end of the year, provided the economy rebounded as expected from a first quarter in which it grew by 0.1% \u2013 the slowest pace in more than five years. Two committee members, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty, said rising pay caused by falling unemployment required an immediate increase in interest rates. The Bank\u2019s decision \u2013 outlined in its quarterly inflation report \u2013 will come as no surprise to the City, which expected Threadneedle Street to ditch plans for tighter policy this month in the light of weak growth, a faster-than-expected fall in inflation and evidence that consumers were cutting back on spending. Even so, news that a rate increase was being delayed resulted in the pound falling against the dollar to below $1.35, its lowest level in four months. The minutes of this week\u2019s MPC meeting showed rate rises are still being planned in order to meet the government\u2019s 2% inflation target, but the language was notably softer than in February when the Bank said policy would probably need to be tightened earlier and to a greater extent than the markets were expecting. Three months ago, the Bank had been pencilling in growth of 0.4% in the first quarter and 1.8% for 2018 as a whole. The near-stalling of the economy has led the MPC to cut its annual growth forecast to 1.4% for this year. But Threadneedle Street\u2019s belief that little fundamental has changed since February and that the economy actually grew more strongly than 0.1% has kept alive speculation that a quarter-point increase in borrowing costs is possible when the next inflation report is released in August. Carney said that if the economy performed as the Bank expected, a \u201cmodest tightening\u201d of policy would be warranted. The Bank believes the economy has the potential to grow at about 1.5% a year but that demand will slightly exceed that limit in the coming years in the absence of a gentle increase in interest rates. The financial markets are expecting three quarter-point increases over the next three years. As in February, the MPC pointed to the fall in unemployment to its lowest level since the mid-1970s as the reason why rates would eventually have to rise. Wage pressures are expected to build as employers struggle to recruit and retain staff. Bank economists think the first-quarter growth figure was distorted by unusually cold weather and will eventually be revised up to 0.3%. \u201cSurvey indicators, and evidence from the Bank\u2019s (regional) agents, suggested that growth had been somewhat stronger in the first quarter than implied by the preliminary estimate,\u201d the MPC minutes said. Even so, the seven members of the MPC who voted for no change said they wanted confirmation that the economy had merely been going through a soft patch before voting for higher rates. \u201cGiven the recent weakness in consumer credit and the housing market, there was somewhat greater than usual uncertainty about the near-term momentum in consumer spending and the extent to which households would adjust their spending and saving to the past fall in their real incomes,\u201d the minutes said. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of trade union body the TUC, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the right decision not to raise interest rates. You don\u2019t kick the economy when it\u2019s down. Now the government must get our ailing economy back on its feet, delivering decent jobs and a real rise in wages.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Melrose shareholders revolt against directors' \u00a342m bonuses", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shareholders in turnaround specialist Melrose have staged one of the largest pay revolts this year, amid disgruntlement over a decision to pay a \u00a342m bonus to each of four directors. Nearly 26% of Melrose shareholders who voted at the firm\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday failed to back its pay report, with leading City institution and top 20 shareholder Standard Life Aberdeen among the rebels. Insurance group Direct Line also had a shareholder rebellion on Thursday when 23% voted against directors\u2019 pay. The protests focused on the \u00a3657,000 basic pay awarded to its new finance director, Penny James, whose pay is 38% more than her predecessor\u2019s. The Melrose and Direct Line protests extend a series of recent clashes between UK companies and investors that have resulted in bloody noses at Unilever and the housebuilder Persimmon, and forced the satellite firm Inmarsat to rewrite its pay plans. The revolt at Melrose comes too late to stop the \u00a342m bonus payments, which investors approved in previous years. Nor will the vote affect directors\u2019 current pay packets, because rules giving shareholders the power to block remuneration deals require opposition from more than 50% of voting investors. But it will be seen as a rap on the knuckles for a decision to hand out \u00a3167m to just four men \u2013 the executive chairman, Christopher Miller, the executive vice-chairman, David Roper, the chief executive, Simon Peckham, and the group finance director, Geoffrey Martin. Melrose said after the vote that it would \u201creview the existing ... remuneration arrangements\u201d. But a source close to the company pointed out that shareholders agreed to the long-term incentive plan in 2012, adding that new opposition may have come partly from former shareholders in GKN, the engineering firm Melrose bought earlier this year for \u00a38bn. Melrose\u2019s business model involves buying companies it believes are being run inefficiently and stripping out costs, before selling all or part of the business for a profit. The strategy has led to the company being accused of \u201casset-stripping\u201d, most recently by political opponents of the GKN deal. Melrose said it delivered returns of \u00a33.6bn to investors between 2012 and 2017 via a string of takeovers that also triggered large windfalls for directors, in contrast to the more conventional pay scheme that long-time GKN investors are used to. As Melrose faced down investors, the insurer Aviva came under fire from small shareholders over executive pay. The firm has pledged to make \u00a314m of goodwill payments to people who lost money by selling its shares after it announced that it could cancel preference shares, triggering a sharp share price drop. Aviva then scrapped the plans, but its handling of the issue has drawn scrutiny from the City watchdog and investors, one of whom described the goodwill payments as \u201cflimsy and patronising fudge\u201d, demanding that directors hand back bonuses. Earlier this month, a revolt from more than 60% of voting investors forced Inmarsat to rip up its pay proposals, continuing a long-running dispute that had broken out into rebellion three times in the past six years. More than a third of Unilever investors registered opposition to its pay plans earlier this month, while Persimmon experienced a revolt against the \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d \u00a375m bonus handed to its chief executive, Jeff Fairburn. The payout was ultimately approved because nearly a third of shareholders abstained and of those who voted, 51.5% cast in favour and 48.5% against. Binding votes on pay were introduced by the former business minister Vince Cable in 2013, after the so-called Shareholder spring of 2012, when investors lodged protests against executive pay packets that they saw as excessive.",

      "bodyText": "The humbling of BT in two short years has been extraordinary. Back in May 2016, the chief executive, Gavin Patterson, was hailing the \u201clandmark\u201d acquisition of mobile operator EE; was reporting the strongest revenues for seven years; and was promising that a dividend that had just been raised by 13% could be juiced by a further 10%-plus in each of the next two years. And now? EE still looks a good purchase but group revenues are falling again and BT has been forced into a huge restructuring programme that will see 13,000 jobs cut. The old dividend promise had already been exposed as hubristic. BT managed a 10% boost a year ago but a flat payment this year is now seen a semi-triumph or, in the sceptics\u2019 view, an unaffordable luxury. The share price, down 7% on Thursday, stands at a five-year low. What happened? Some factors were outside BT\u2019s control: smartphones and standard broadband markets are less exciting than they used to be. But the Italian accounting scandal was a self-inflicted disaster and BT has simply underperformed on big-ticket IT work. More importantly, there is a strong sense BT has wasted too much energy fighting government and regulators over the speed and scale of investment in fast-fibre broadband, all the while annoying everybody by spending heavily on Premier League TV rights. In a very limited sense, the football strategy worked because Sky has now agreed a content-sharing deal, which will benefit both parties. But BT made itself an easy target to hit. The complaint that the national telephony champion, especially one constrained by a large pension deficit, should put fibre over football is 100% legitimate. The new BT chairman, Jan du Plessis, concedes relationships with officialdom were \u201cstrained\u201d but thinks matters are improving now that semi-separation of broadband subsidiary Openreach, as commanded by Ofcom, has happened. We\u2019ll only know if a truce has been declared, however, when the government publishes its white paper on telecoms infrastructure in the summer. BT is spending more on fibre, but is it spending enough? It is \u2013 just about \u2013 possible to think the worst has passed. The grand three-year restructuring will save \u00a31.5bn a year eventually and has a two-year payback. An affordable settlement with the pension trustees has been agreed. The group still expects to generate \u00a32.4bn of cash this year, enough in theory to cover a dividend costing \u00a31.5bn. But the eye-catching 7% yield on the shares suggest the market has its doubts. One can understand why. Two years ago, when Patterson was promising 10% divi increases, it was because he was confident. Now he is promising same-again dividends because he is confident about the \u201cupdated\u201d strategy. Until the numbers arrive as advertised, there is a credibility deficit. RBS sell-off should not be done in haste It\u2019s \u201ca milestone moment\u201d for Royal Bank of Scotland, says chief executive Ross McEwan, which is an oddly cheerful way to describe an agreement to hand over $4.9bn (\u00a33.6bn) in cash to the US Department of Justice. But we know what he means: a settlement to cover misdeeds in the world of toxic US mortgage debt on Fred Goodwin\u2019s watch was thought to be imminent about 18 months ago, so it\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s finally happened, and a better thing that the terms are not as severe as feared. Some thought the hit could be $7bn. The next milestone will be the restoration of dividends, which will be possible only if the Bank of England gives consent. That\u2019s possible early next year if RBS still has a theoretical \u00a34bn of capital beyond regulatory minimums. Just don\u2019t expect the full lot to be dispatched as an opening gambit \u2013 even half would be bold. Then, presumably, the Treasury will restart the process of reducing the state\u2019s 70% stake, currently worth \u00a324bn. The nation is resigned (or should be) to the thought of losing money on the bailout of RBS, but taxpayers and non-taxpayers deserve to get the best possible sale price. The best method is to follow the model used with Lloyds Banking Group: sell parcels of stock in the market over time, thereby causing minimum price disruption. So, please, Philip Hammond, if you\u2019re still chancellor next year, do not try to disguise our RBS pain with flashy discount offers to retail investors served up with fatuous slogans about promoting shareholder democracy. You are selling for the benefit of the public purse. Discounts for individuals with spare cash to invest at short notice would be grossly unfair. A Lloyds-style process will inevitably take many years \u2013 but everything always does at RBS.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A cross-party group of MPs is to investigate how to revive England\u2019s ailing town centres which are under increasing threat from online shopping and the financial problems facing some of the biggest high street names. The housing, communities and local government committee has invited submissions to an inquiry that will consider what high streets and town centres could look like by 2030. Clive Betts, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cOur high streets and town centres have an important social, civic and cultural place in our society. But, many of our high streets are now struggling, facing a range of challenges including the threat posed by online retailers. \u201cChanging trends and behaviours in recent decades \u2013 driven by a range of economic, demographic, social and technological factors \u2013 have affected the prosperity and vibrancy of our high streets.\u201d Recent high street casualties include Maplin and Toys R Us, while retailers ranging from House of Fraser and Mothercare to New Look and Carpetright have all announced plans to close shops and cut jobs. Many restaurant chains are also facing problems, with the Prezzo group, Byron and Jamie\u2019s Italian all closing branches. The Cau steakhouse chain, it has emerged, could also be shut down. Sir Ian Cheshire, the chairman of Debenhams who used to run B&amp;Q, warned on Wednesday that onerous leases in UK town centres are \u201ckilling more and more retailers\u201d. He told ITV News that the decline of the high street would accelerate unless the government reformed the tax system and landlords showed greater flexibility. Cheshire said the current system, with business rates based on property values and many retailers still wrestling with landlord agreements that include upwards-only rent reviews, gave online-only retailers like Amazon an unfair advantage. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is retail facing more change in the past three years than in the previous 20 ... It\u2019s a big structural shift which is basically saying old models have to be reinvented,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re starting out now you\u2019d have much less space, much more online and much more flexibility. No one will now be signing 20-year leases.\u201d Debenhams is closing eight of its 165 UK stores and is in talks with its landlords about reducing space at 30 more. As well as examining the challenges facing high streets and town centres, the MPs\u2019 inquiry will consider whether councils have the correct planning, licensing, tax-raising and other tools needed to help local areas. It is not the first time the problems facing UK high streets have been the subject of investigation. In 2011 David Cameron asked the retail guru Mary Portas to come up with a plan to save traditional high streets, then under threat from out-of-town shopping centres and supermarkets moving into non-food sectors. Now, however, supermarkets and out-of-town shopping centres are also feeling the squeeze as a result of a huge change in shopping habits. Nearly \u00a360bn was spent via smartphones and tablets in 2017 \u2013 a figure that equates to more than \u00a31 in every \u00a36 spent on the high street. While the shift is benefitting online-only retailers such as Amazon and Asos, it is forcing radical change on the country\u2019s towns and cities as huge swaths of physical retail space becomes redundant. The committee said it welcomes the views of the public on why their high street matters and what improvements could be made.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s news from the Bank of England. The Bank of England has put back plans for an increase in interest rates after the weaker-than-expected performance of the economy in early 2018. Although the Bank believes the soft patch in growth will prove temporary, seven of the nine members of its monetary policy committee adopted a wait-and-see approach to raising official borrowing costs and voted to keep them at 0.5%. Two members of the committee \u2013 Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty \u2013 said rising pay caused by falling unemployment required an immediate increase in interest rates. The Bank\u2019s decision \u2013 which was outlined in its quarterly inflation report \u2013 will come as no surprise to the City, which expected Threadneedle Street to ditch plans for tighter policy this month in the light of first quarter growth of 0.1%, a faster-than-expected fall in inflation and evidence that consumers were cutting back on spending. The minutes of this week\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting show that rate rises are still being planned in order to meet the government\u2019s 2% inflation target, but the language was notably softer than in February when the Bank said policy would probably need to be tightened earlier and to a greater extent than the markets were expecting. Three months ago, the Bank had been pencilling in growth of 0.4% in the first quarter and 1.8% for 2018 as a whole. The near-stalling of the economy has led the MPC to cut its annual growth forecast to 1.4% for this year.... That\u2019s probably all for today; thanks for reading and commenting. GW Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes UK interest rates may not rise until 2019! He blames the return of the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 today: Not for the first time, Mark Carney\u2019s policy of guiding the markets as to what to expect has backfired. A month or so ago it looked like a May rate rise was a near-certainty. The Bank of England had upgraded its growth forecasts and in March two members of the MPC broke ranks and voted for an immediate rate rise. Markets were then pricing in a 90% chance of a rate rise at this month\u2019s policy meeting. But since then things have changed. First-quarter economic growth was a disappointing 0.1%, and the ONS said the bad weather wasn\u2019t to blame. Add in an (un)healthy dose of Brexit uncertainty, and the chance of a rate hike had dwindled to just 8% at the start of this week. As such today\u2019s no change decision wasn\u2019t a surprise, and barely caused a ripple in the markets Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says Mark Carney has once again disappointed those hoping for an interest rate rise - and the pound is paying the price: \u201cOnce again, Mark Carney and the MPC have backed away from hiking interest rates mere months after hinting that a move was imminent. The MPC holding fire on hikes is not an issue in itself \u2013 the committee is data dependent, and recent UK data has been poor \u2013 but the dangers of making overly explicit statements on future policy moves have been made clear. Carney\u2019s warnings from February about rates rising earlier and to a greater extent now once again look like the promises of an unreliable boyfriend \u2013 and sterling is again suffering from being jilted at the rate hike altar. Craig Inches, Head of Rates &amp; Cash at Royal London Asset Management, thinks the Bank of England has fumbled the opportunity to raise interest rates today. \u201cIn our view, the Bank has missed another opportunity to raise rates. Despite a run of soft data, the economy may turn out to be more robust than recent evidence, and the Bank\u2019s newly lowered forecasts, suggest.\u201d \u201cInterestingly two members of the MPC also agree with us, while the press conference by Mark Carney and colleagues was in fact more hawkish than the headlines suggest. Newsflash: Sterling is now at a four-month low against the US dollar: Peter Dixon of German bank Commerzbank believes the Bank of England sounded rather more dovish about interest rate policy today. He writes: The forecast is conditioned on three rate hikes of 25 bps over the next three years and markets have slashed the probability assigned to a rate move in 2018. That\u2019s why the pound has fallen against the US dollar today; currently down 0.5% at $1.348. Anthony Gillham of wealth manager Quilter thinks the media\u2019s questions about Mark Carney\u2019s unreliability hit a nerve today: \u201cCarney\u2019s snap at the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 tag reveals the tension between the City clamour over interest rate changes and the real impact on households. Unsurprisingly, the Bank is probably feeling a little defensive that its own \u2018forward guidance\u2019 seems to have misled the City. As a result he was keen to distinguish between the City and his other key stakeholder, UK households. He is right to do so, but the truth is that they\u2019re inextricably linked. The market expected a rise largely because it predicted the economy would be carrying more momentum and inflation would be running higher. Those predictions have proved overly optimistic, which is definitely a concern for households, and that is why rates are staying flat today. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool thinks that Brexit uncertainty is helping to push Britain\u2019s next interest rate rise further and further into the future. He\u2019s plotted the Bank of England\u2019s GDP growth forecasts alongside economic policy uncertainty (based on the number of articles about economic worries in The Times and the FT). It shows a \u201cclear negative correlation\u201d, he says (sagging growth and media angst about the economy go hand in hand). Professor Milas adds: Notice, also, that - unfortunately - current uncertainty has started picking up again. If this persists, August\u2019s Inflation Report will trim further the growth forecast which will of course delay even further a possible hike. Nice snap summary from Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward: After years of playing the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019, Mark Carney is turning into the tetchy husband who keeps promising to take the bins out, but never quite gets round to it. Today\u2019s excuse for not raising interest rates is that the UK economy has slowed in recent months, as the Beast From The East hit construction activity and kept shoppers off the high street. A fair point. In the same breath, Carney sounds confident that the economy will rebound in the months ahead - even though the Bank has cut its 2018 growth forecast from a moderate 1.8% to a modest 1.4%. Faced with repeated questioning about his failure to raise borrowing costs, the governor declared: What\u2019s the sensible thing to do? Do you act now or do you wait to see evidence that that momentum is re-asserting? \u201cThe judgement of the majority of the committee is you wait to see for some evidence of that reasserting.\u201d So, we can all expect the bins to finally be dragged out at the Bank\u2019s next meeting, in June? Or perhaps August (when the BoE will hold its next \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 press conference)?.... Not necessarily. Mark Carney is refusing to make any sweeping commitments. He even argues that the British public isn\u2019t too fixated on the timing of rate rises, and understands they\u2019ll happen at the appropriate time. He said: The expectations of those individuals - more than three-quarters of those, whether they\u2019re individuals or businesses - is that interest rates are going to go up, are likely to go up at some point over the course of the next years,probably a couple of times over the next year, year and a half.\u201d \u201cSo they are in a position that they can plan accordingly for that possibility, they don\u2019t think it\u2019s a guarantee, they think it\u2019s a likelihood.\u201d Andrew Sentance, a former member of the MPC, isn\u2019t impressed: Carney could, rightly, point out that the Bank should hold off raising interest rates until we have more clarity on the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU. But that might be too political for the governor, Instead, he cautioned: While the storms of February and March have given way to sunnier skies, the economic outlook for the UK remains clouded by Brexit uncertainties. Despite the welcome agreement on a transition period, the terms on which the UK will trade with the EU beyond that period remain to be determined.\u201d Mark Carney also tried to rise above the fray, arguing that families aren\u2019t busy trading the \u2018short-sterling\u2019 rates in an attempt to predict interest rate moves. True, but those financial instruments still really matter (as Carney understands all too well, of course). So when might UK interest rates actually go up? Yael Selfin, Chief Economist at KPMG in the UK, thinks it might not happen until November - which would be a year after the last hike. She writes: \u201cFaced with weaker economic data in the first quarter of 2018, the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee decided to opt for caution and to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.5% today. While the decision had been largely anticipated, it marks a significant shift from expectations only a few weeks ago for a rate rise in May. \u201cThe strong labour market, together with a range of business surveys as well as what we see on the ground talking to our clients, do not point to a material shift in the economic environment, and support the view that the weakness at the start of the year is likely to be at least partially reversed further on this year. \u201cWhile on paper there are a number of opportunities for the MPC to raise rates this year, the next rise may now only take place in November. It is likely to coincide with a new Inflation Report and the MPC may wish to avoid a rate rise in August when markets are thinner and businesses and households could be caught off-guard while on holiday. That would make a relatively long delay in policy action due to a potential short blip in data.\u201d Oh, and what about *that* nickname? Well, governor Carney looked rather tired of being labeled an unreliable suitor (a moniker that dates back to 2014). He told the press: The only people who throw that term at me are in this room. So now everyone else can throw it at me when I go out of this room.\u201d And finally... Q: The Office for National Statistics has just lowered its estimate of the UK trade deficit by a quarter - so how reliable is Britain\u2019s data, and does it mean that the UK is still \u2018reliant on the kindness of strangers\u2019 [an old Carney quote] Great question, says Mark Carney, who bats it across to deputy Ben Broadbent. Broadbent explains that economic data can always be revised and updated as new information comes in, and economists update and refine their models. It\u2019s a mistake to treat it as God-given and fixed. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: What impact would a hard Brexit have on the Bank\u2019s economic forecasts? Mark Carney replies that a hard Brexit would prompt a change the Bank\u2019s forecasts. But such a scenario it\u2019s not currently included in its economic projections, which are based on a \u2018transition deal\u2019 being agreed and implemented. Handily for the Bank, the likely end of that transition deal comes beyond its current forecast horizon, so it doesn\u2019t need to map the implications (yet....). The Bank has, though, been ensuring that Britain\u2019s banks are well capitalised to handle a Brexit shock. Q: Today\u2019s quarterly inflation report suggests that some business surveys are painting a better (and more optimistic) picture of the UK economy than the official GDP data. So which \u2018soft\u2019 data do you take seriously? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent argues that there\u2019s no contradiction between strong business surveys (which often track sentiment) and weaker GDP data (which measures actual output). Those business surveys have dropped to lower levels, but they don\u2019t point to anything as weak as 0.1% growth (the official first estimate of UK GDP). Good points from Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group: Q: What\u2019s the biggest challenge for your successor, governor? Brexit, perhaps? The biggest challenge, and opportunity, for the country is the Brexit negotiations, Mark Carney replies. He won\u2019t be drawn about his replacement, though (Carney is due to leave the Bank in June 2019). Q: Today\u2019s inflation report seems to suggest that interest rates will rise three times in the next three years - should households expect that? Carney repeats his line that UK households and businesses broadly expect a rate rise this year, and two increases in the next 18 months. But it all depends on how the economy develops. Q: Hasn\u2019t your message on interest rates been diluted since February (when the Bank said rates would probably rise faster than markets expected)? Our \u2018core message\u2019 hasn\u2019t changed, Carney insists. Q: Isn\u2019t there also a danger that wage pressure will also be more muted than the Bank expects? Regular pay has been inline with the Bank\u2019s expectations, Carney replies. Some snap reaction to Carney\u2019s press conference: Q: Are you failing to communicate to the UK public? Carney says that the UK public have understood the Bank\u2019s message in recent years, that interest rates will rise gradually as economic conditions merit it. And he takes a wider view, saying that Britain is in a \u2018different place\u2019 than Europe (which has more spare capacity, and has only just fixed its financial system), but also a \u2018different place\u2019 than America (which doesn\u2019t face the same scale of uncertainty over its future trading relationship). People across the UK understand that, Carney adds. Q: Are you worried that the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 tag will stick, as you\u2019ve once hinted that a rate rise was coming, but not delivered? The households and businesses we speak to don\u2019t trade short sterling**, Carney shoots back. They want to know the general orientation of the economy, that the economy is healthy, and the likely path of interest rates. (** - short sterling is a way of betting on the future path of interest rates). The only people who throw the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 tag at me are in this room, Carney tells the press conference. Now everyone else can use it too. Q: The money markets have priced out an interest rate rise this year. Are you happy with that? Carney repeats that the Bank is primarily concerned with households and businesses (suggesting that he\u2019s focused on higher things than mere City traders and scribblers). But the Bank is also watching the financial markets, of course. The Bank believes that the underlying momentum in the UK economy will reassert itself, but others can take a different view. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent chips in too, saying the markets now suggest there is an 85% chance of a rate rise by November 2018. Onto questions. Q: In the past you\u2019ve told us to watch the data, but today you\u2019re saying that the economy isn\u2019t as weak as the data suggests. So how should people judge what the Bank is going to do? Carney doesn\u2019t accept that the Bank is confusing people. He says that the Bank of England speaks to businesses and individuals across the country. And they expect that interest rates will probably go up a couple of times over the next two couple of years. The Bank can\u2019t judge exactly how fast the economy will grow - that depends on a range of factors. But if the economy is growing faster than its speed limit, then domestic inflationary pressures will probably intensify, so some tightening of monetary policy is probably needed. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee believes that the recent slowdown is temporary, Carney adds. But the sensible thing to do is to wait to see if this is born out by data in the months ahead, rather than hike today. The weather may have improved, but Britain\u2019s economy is still \u201cclouded by Brexit uncertainty\u201d says governor Carney. The position should become clearer later this year as key decisions about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU are made, he adds. The key points from Carney\u2019s statement thus far: The overall economic climate in the UK looks \u2018little changed\u2019, Mark Carney says - perhaps a hint that we shouldn\u2019t get too worried about the lower 2018 growth forecast. The drag from Brexit on business investment has continued, but has not intensified, says Mark Carney. On the consumer side, the bank believes that consumption will pick up as the real income squeeze comes to an end. But the Bank believes that consumption will only grow half as fast as before the EU referendum, and just a third as fast as before the financial crisis. Overall, the climate is one of modest demand growth, with solid growth in net trade and moderate growth in business investment offsetting more modest growth in household spending, Carney says. Mark Carney says the UK economy has not met the Bank\u2019s expectations over the last three months. Growth and inflation have both been lower than the Bank\u2019s forecasts in February, the governor explains. Carey says the Bank believes this softening is a temporary problem, due to the snowy and icy weather which hit Britain earlier this year. Adverse weather hit construction particularly badly, he says, and meant people struggled to get to work or the shops. But the labour market has remained robust, he adds (unemployment is at its lowest rate in four decades, with employment at a record high). The Bank of England is holding a press conference now to explain today\u2019s decision. Governor Mark Carney is in the chair, accompanied by deputies Ben Broadbent and SIr David Ramsden. You can watch it live here: Reaction to the Bank of England decision is flooding in. Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, points out that the BoE has pulled another u-turn - having hinted in February that rates would rise today: \u201cMark Carney really is the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019. Leaving the base rate at 0.5% - what was once thought of as an emergency rate - is another big U-turn for the Bank of England governor. \u201cUntil a few weeks ago, a further quarter point rate hike to 0.75% looked almost guaranteed. But very weak UK GDP growth figures and fast-retreating inflation has seen a rapid reversal of the Old Lady\u2019s increasingly unhelpful forward guidance. The Bank of England has marched investors up to the top of the hill only to march them back down again. Mark Nash, head of fixed income at Old Mutual Global Investors, says weak economic data prevented the Bank raising borrowing costs today. The Bank of England (BoE) chose to keep rates on hold at today\u2019s meeting in light of recent weakness in GDP, falling house prices, lower-than-expected inflation and, no doubt, Brexit uncertainty. There has been broad based weakness in economic data across the globe, ex-US, after a strong Q4 2017 that has led central banks to back away from rate hikes in the near term. Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon, predicts that the Bank will remain cautious in the coming months: \u201cThe last quarter has seen muted economic activity \u2013 with growth of only 0.1% \u2013 aligned with more modest forecasts of future growth. \u201cThe reasons for caution shown today by the Bank of England are clear. The pound appears to have stabilised reducing future inflation risk, UK growth expectations are lower, and the global picture is less certain. \u201cWe see these forces, reinforced by Brexit uncertainty, persisting into the second half of 2018 and reducing the likely pace of future rate increases.\u201d The Bank is sticking to its promise that interest rates will probably rise in the months ahead. The minutes say: The Committee\u2019s best collective judgement therefore remains that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with the May Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a conventional horizon. As previously, however, that judgement relies on the economic data evolving broadly in line with the Committee\u2019s projections. For the majority of members, an increase in Bank Rate was not required at this meeting. All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. But until the Bank actually raises interest rates, that reputation of being an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 will linger. The pound has fallen, as City traders digest the Bank of England\u2019s decision to cut its growth forecasts and left UK interest rates unchanged. Having put its nose over the $1.36 mark in late-morning trading, sterling has now turned tail and fallen to $1.351. That\u2019s close to a four-month low. The Bank of England says uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union is weighing on the economy. The minutes of today\u2019s meeting say: Although business investment is still restrained by Brexit-related uncertainties, it is being supported, like exports, by strong global demand and accommodative financial conditions. Household consumption growth remains subdued, in line with the modest growth in real income over the forecast period. A majority of the Bank\u2019s policymakers wanted to leave interest rates alone until they know if last quarter\u2019s weak growth was just a blip, or something more serious. The Bank\u2019s minutes say: \u201cThe recent weakness in data for the first quarter had been consistent with a temporary soft patch, with few implications for ... the outlook for the UK economy,.... There was value in seeing how the data unfolded over the coming months, to discern whether the softness in Q1 might persist.\u201d Ouch! The Bank of England has taken an axe to its growth forecasts. It now expects the UK economy to only grow by 1.4% this year, down from 1.8% expected just three months ago. This follows the disappointing GDP figures at the start of this year, which showed growth almost flat-lining at just 0.1%. Growth in 2019 and 2020 has been cut too, from 1.8% to 1.7%. Seven Bank of England policymakers voted to leave borrowing costs on hold. But two members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to hike. The hawks, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders argued that borrowing costs should go up. BREAKING: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged. The headline cost of borrowing remains at 0.5%. The Bank has also left its asset-purchase scheme (QE) unchanged. The move suggests the BoE doesn\u2019t think the UK economy is strong enough to handle higher interest rates, following the slowdown in growth at the start of this year. More to follow.... The pound has crept back up over $1.36 against the US dollar, up 0.5% today, as traders brace for the Bank of England decision to hit the wires at noon precisely. Today\u2019s interest rate decision is being taken by the nine members of Britain\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee - a mixture of top Bank officials and independent experts. Two external members, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, are on the hawkish end of the committee table - they voted to raise rates in March, and may do so again. On the opposite side sit two dovish deputy governors, Sirs Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden. They both opposed last November\u2019s interest rate rise (from 0.25% to 0.5%), and may need plenty of persuading to vote for a hike. That leaves the five \u2018swing\u2019 voters - governor Mark Carney, deputy Ben Broadband, the maverick chief economist Andy Haldane, and external members Gertjan Vlieghe and Silvana Tenreyro. They could surprise the markets by voting to raise borrowing costs today.... Excitement is mounting in the City, with just 30 minutes until the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision. Most experts expect borrowing costs to remain unchanged. But you never know....central bankers have pulled a few surprises over the years (and a shock move always has more impact than a widely-trailed one). Gambling site Betway is offering 6/1 on a rate rise today, and 10/1 on a cut! Spokesman Alan Alger says: We know that another rate hike should come at some point before the end of the year, and May looked very likely just a few weeks ago, though the combination of flagging inflation and underwhelming growth means we\u2019re now just 1/5 for rates to remain at 0.5%. Some commentators even believe that a cut to interest rates would serve the economy better than a rise, though Mark Carney and Co look unlikely to take such a daring decision at 10/1.\u201d Britain\u2019s chancellor has welcomed the news that Royal Bank of Scotland is paying a $4.9bn penalty to US authorities. The fine for misselling financial instruments that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis has been hanging over RBS for years. Philip Hammond hopes that last night\u2019s settlement will make it easier to sell the taxpayer\u2019s stake in the bank. Hammond says: \u201cI welcome the agreement in principle to resolve this long-standing issue which will, when finalised, remove a major uncertainty for the UK taxpayer. \u201cIt marks another significant milestone in RBS\u2019s work to resolve its legacy issues, and will help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares.\u201d Shareholders may also be relieved, as RBS\u2019s payment is smaller than expected. Shares in the Bank have jumped this morning, towards the top of the FTSE leaderboard. There\u2019s drama in Italy today, as two populist parties suddenly move closer to the levers of power. Late last night, former PM Silvio Berlusconi dropped his opposition to an alliance between the right-wing, anti-immigrant League party, and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Berlusconi dramatically declared that his Forza Italia party would not block a League-M5S coalition, seemingly clearing the way for the two parties to team up. The move came after two months of deadlock following the last Italian general election, which failed to deliver a clear winner. Unless a government can be agreed today, a technocratic government could be imposed. An alliance between M5S and the League has been seen as the worst scenario for Brussels, as both parties are inclined to unravel the painful austerity experienced by Italy in recent years. Italian bond price have fallen this morning... however, they\u2019re still looking healthier than before March\u2019s election, suggesting investors aren\u2019t that worried. As Paul Donovan of UBS puts it: The Italian president has suggested parties have until this afternoon to come up with a workable government before a technocrat government is imposed. Former Prime Minister Berlusconi has suggested that Forza Italia may back a government led by the \u201canti-party\u201d Five Star movement. That would not be viewed as market friendly, but Italian investors have a certain amount of experience with political uncertainty. Over in the City, shares in BT has slumped by 8% to a five-year low. Investors are unhappy that BT expects revenues to fall by 2% this year, while earnings will also fall year-on year. The telecoms group\u2019s staff have also been shaken by the news that 13,000 jobs are being axed, as the company plans to quit its London HQ after 150 years. This will be partly offset by 6,000 new engineering hires. Our media correspondent, Mark Sweney, says the shake-up comes after a \u2018torrid\u2019 18 months for BT: The telecoms company said the job losses would come mainly from back office and middle-management roles. About two-thirds of the job cuts will fall on its UK workforce of about 80,000, with the remainder coming from the 18,000 staff it employs internationally. BT is also moving out of its central London headquarters in St Paul\u2019s, where it has been headquartered since 1874 when the group was known as the General Post Office, as part of a wide-ranging restructuring. BT has also announced a new plan to tackle its pensions deficit, including a payment of \u00a34.5bn. Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, says BT has provided clarity, but questions and doubts over its future remain: \u201cWhile some parts of the consumer-facing businesses are seeing good growth and investors should be interested in the plans to restructure, the group is still under pressure on a number of fronts and therefore the shares are no better than a hold.\u201d Several commentators are pointing out that BT has lavished cash on buying sports broadcasting rights, only to now turn around and axe thousands of staff: We also have fresh evidence that Britain\u2019s manufacturers and construction firms both struggled in March. The Office for National Statistics has reported that manufacturing output fell by 0.1% in March, and has been unimpressive since the start of this year. Builders had an even rougher time! Construction output fell by 2.3% in March, and has fallen by 2.7% since the start of the year. That\u2019s the worst quarterly fall in five years. The Bank of England may feel that this is a good reason not to raise interest rates yet. The ONS\u2019s head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith says the data show that the UK economy was \u201cvery sluggish in the first quarter of 2018, with little impact overall from the bad weather\u201d. \u201cManufacturing was broadly flat throughout the first quarter following several months of strong growth, with no evidence that the bad weather hampered UK factories as both domestic and international sales stalled. Machinery, transport and computer manufacturers all saw their output grow. This was largely offset by falling production of electrical equipment and oil refining. \u201cThe whole construction sector performed poorly in the first quarter with housing, repair work and public works seeing particularly large falls. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s trade deficit has narrowed, thanks to a drop in imports from non-EU countries. The Office for National Statistics has reported that Britain bought fewer ships and aircraft from the rest of the world in the first quarter of 2018. This helped to cut the UK total trade deficit (in goods and services) by \u00a3700m to \u00a36.9 billion in the three months to March 2018. But, today\u2019s figures also show that Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the European Union has widened this year - as the debate over Brexit, customs unions and tariffs has raged. The ONS explains: The UK trade in goods deficit with non-EU countries narrowed \u00a31.5 billion to \u00a39.9 billion in the three months to March 2018, while the deficit with the EU widened \u00a30.4 billion to \u00a324.7 billion over the same period. Today is dubbed \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 because the Bank of England will release its interest rate decision, publish the minutes of the meeting, and also give us a fresh assessment of the UK economy (the Quarterly Inflation Report). So there\u2019ll be lots to watch out for at noon. Including: 1) The actual policy decision: Will the Bank leave borrowing costs at 0.5%, or surprise us with a quarter-point hike? 2) The split. In March, two policymakers voted to raise interest rates but were outvoted by the other seven members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Will we get a 7-2 split again today, or will more MPC members vote to hike? 3) The language: We could get a \u2018hawkish hold\u2019, in which the Bank leaves rates on hold but hints that a rise is coming. But would investors believe them, after so many similar promises before? 4) The growth forecasts. The latest GDP figures show the economy only expanded by 0.1% in the first three months of 2018, weaker than the Bank expected. This may force its forecasters to cut their growth expectations for 2018. The pound could surge, or slump, depending on what the Bank of England does today. Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at ING, has predicted that sterling could slump by two cents to $1.3350 if the Bank votes unanimously to leave interest rates on hold. But if we get a surprise rate hike, the pound could surge by three cents to $1.3850, Patel estimates. This chart of City expectations for today\u2019s interest rate decision shows why the old \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 line is doing the rounds again. The upward spike in early February was prompted by the Bank of England; it said that monetary policy needed to be tightened \u201csomewhat earlier and faster\u201d than previously thought. A clear hint that a rate rise was coming, in other words. Stephanie Flanders, head of Bloomberg Economics, says the Bank of England has created a communications problem for itself. She predicts the BoE will probably execute a \u2018reverse-ferret\u2019 (an old journalistic phrase for a bare-faced u-turn) today. Expectations of a UK interest rate rise today have faded fast in recent weeks, says Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. That\u2019s partly thanks to Mark Carney\u2019s warning in April that Britain\u2019s economic data was looking \u2018mixed\u2019 Only one month ago, the markets were predicting a more than 90% probability of a UK interest rate increase this month. Today, this probability has evaporated to less than 15%. A crippling combination of negative economic data, disappointing growth figures and another reversal in tone from BoE Governor Mark Carney has been the driver behind these minimal expectations of a UK interest rate rise today. Mark Carney was originally dubbed an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 nearly four years ago. Labour MP Pat McFadden coined the tag during a select committee hearing, when he teased the governor for promising interest rate hikes, and then changing his mind. As McFadden put it: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of different signals. I mean it strikes me that the Bank\u2019s behaving a bit like a sort of unreliable boyfriend. \u201cOne day hot, one day cold, and the people on the other side of the message are left not really knowing where they stand.\u201d Governor Carney must feel such criticism is unfair. His \u2018forward guidance\u2019 was based on the promise that the Bank would only raise borrowing costs when the economic data justified it. But the tag has stuck - mainly because the BoE held rates through 2014 and 2015, actually ended up cutting rates after the Brexit vote in 2016. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on the Bank of England this morning as Britain\u2019s central bank meets to set interest rates, and releases its latest assessment of the UK economy. And what a difference three weeks makes. For months, City investors have had today\u2019s meeting circled in their diaries, as the moment when the BoE would raise borrowing costs for only the second time in a decade (the first was last November). After all, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has dropped plenty of hints that a rate rise was coming. However, Carney seems to have got cold feet (not for the first time either!). Last month, he pulled a screeching u-turn, telling the media that expectations of a rate rise had been overblown. That\u2019s because recent economic data from the UK has been rather disappointing, with growth almost stalling in the first three months of 2018. It\u2019s hardly ideal conditions to be raising borrowing costs. So, the likelihood is that the BoE will sit on its hands at noon today - although some policymakers may well agitate for a hike from 0.5% to 0.75%. As this chart shows, in March investors thought a hike today was a near-certainty. Now, it would be a serious shock. Carney should prepare himself for a bruising interrogation from the economics press when he explains today\u2019s decision, at 12.30pm. Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, says some might argue that Carney has \u201cmade a mess of things\u201d by preparing us all for higher interest rates. \u201dSome might say Bank of England Governor Mark Carney made a mess of things again. As late as February he was still very positive on monetary policy. But dismal retail sales, disappointing GDP growth and the accelerating softening of inflation have burst Carney\u2019s bubble. Since Carney\u2019s credibility is obviously at stake again the question for the BoE rate decision then becomes: will Mark Carney pull off a Houdini worthy escape act, or will markets once again call him out as an \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d? \u201cWe don\u2019t expect a rate hike tomorrow and we even envision the economic growth expectations to be lowered for the rest of the year. Also coming up... It\u2019s a busy day for corporate news. Overnight, Royal Bank of Scotland finally reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the misselling of mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis. It\u2019s paying a $4.9bn fine - in a \u201cmilestone moment\u201d in the bank\u2019s long, slow recovery. The other big shock is that BT is cutting 13,000 jobs, and planning to exit its London headquarters, as part of a strategic shake-up. More on that shortly Next, the retailer, has better news; it\u2019s raised its profit forecast after reporting better than expected sales in recent weeks, as the warmer weather lured shoppers into buying new outfits.

Documents filed at the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday by C.banner reveal that House of Fraser Group, which includes the department store chain\u2019s two Chinese outlets, slumped from a \u00a31.5m pretax profit in 2016 to a \u00a343.9m loss last year.

It said the deal would deliver cost savings and benefits by bringing together C.banner\u2019s footwear business, Hamleys and House of Fraser.

The acquisition is structured via the buyout of a 34% stake from the current owner, Nanjing Cenbest, part of the Chinese conglomerate Sanpower, for \u00a371m and then the acquisition of \u00a369m in new shares to be issued. The announcement reveals the full price paid by C.banner for the first time. The deal relates to House of Fraser\u2019s parent group, which owns an 89% stake in the UK business, with Sports Direct holding an 11% stake. Sports Direct has expressed concern about events, taking legal action to seek further information on the company\u2019s business plan including a major restructuring.

      "bodyText": "The Argentine restaurant group Gaucho is considering the closure of its casual dining steakhouse Cau with the potential loss of about 700 jobs. It is understood that the privately owned group has appointed advisory firm KPMG to help assess options for the future of Cau, which has 22 restaurants around the country. The restaurant chain, which serves up burgers and brunch with a Buenos Aires theme alongside steak dinners, has suffered sales declines in double digits for more than a year amid heavy competition and a squeeze on consumer spending. Cau was launched in 2010 and expanded rapidly. Its owner also runs nearly 20 Gaucho-branded restaurants. The Gaucho chain is performing in line with expectations and is not expected to be affected. A company spokesperson said: \u201cAs part of a comprehensive strategic review, the group\u2019s new management team, with the support of its shareholders, is at the early stages of exploring a number of financial restructuring options. No decisions have yet been made.\u201d Gaucho is understood to be considering closing Cau via a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), Sky News reported. A CVA is a form of insolvency that has recently been used by a string of high street businesses facing tough times. The upmarket burger chain Byron, Jamie Oliver\u2019s Jamie\u2019s Italian restaurants and Prezzo, the owners of Chimichanga, have all used the process to close stores or cut rents in recent months in a casual dining crunch that followed a wave of private equity investment in the sector. The high street chains New Look and Carpetright have also closed stores via CVAs, and Poundworld wants to close about 100 stores using the process, while House of Fraser is expected to close about 20 stores in a CVA due to launch next month. Restaurants and retailers have come under pressure amid rising business rates and minimum wage costs as well as a slowdown in consumer spending as inflation, especially on food prices, has outstripped wage rises. The private equity firm Equistone bought the Gaucho group in January 2016 having backed a management buyout in 2005. In January, it hired Oliver Meakin, the former boss of the electronics store Maplin, which fell into administration in February.",

      "bodyText": "BT is to axe about 13,000 jobs over the next three years and move out of its central London headquarters after almost 150 years, as it seeks to cut \u00a31.5bn in costs after a torrid 18 months. The telecoms company said the job losses would come mainly from back office and middle-management roles. About two-thirds of the job cuts will fall on its UK workforce of about 83,000, with the remainder coming from the 23,000 staff it employs internationally. BT is also moving out of its central London headquarters in St Paul\u2019s, where it has been headquartered since 1874 when the group was known as the General Post Office, as part of a wide-ranging restructuring. \u201cThis is probably the most significant transformation we have made in the last 10 years,\u201d said Gavin Patterson, the chief executive of BT. \u201cWe need to do this to be competitive in the future. If we are compared with our peers we are frankly too complex and overweight. While I recognise the pain, ultimately it is the right thing to do for the business.\u201d The group also said it would be hiring about 6,000 new staff, primarily in customer service and engineering. BT\u2019s standalone subsidiary Openreach, which is responsible for building and managing most of the UK\u2019s broadband infrastructure, has already announced 3,500 of the new jobs. It is looking to hire engineers this year as part of a plan to speed up the rollout of fibre broadband and eliminate \u201cnot-spots\u201d in cities and suburban areas. The job cuts, which amount to about 13% of BT\u2019s total global workforce, mean the company will ultimately be cutting about 17,000 jobs over a four-year period. Last May, it cut 4,000 jobs, with about half coming from the UK, to save \u00a3300m over two years. BT said the move out of St Paul\u2019s formed part of a plan to cut the number of locations it owns across the UK. Patterson said that about 80% of its staff were based in around 50 offices across the UK. That number will be cut to 30 \u201cmodern, strategic sites to create a more collaborative, open and customer-focused working culture\u201d. \u201cIn many cities we have multiple offices, it is about consolidating in key towns,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cWe will certainly have a headquarters in London; this is not BT moving out of London. It is more likely to be in a smaller, future-oriented working environment.\u201d The company said it is looking at \u201call options\u201d for the future of the St Paul\u2019s site. It would not comment on the value of the property, which has a varied history including being damaged in the first and second world wars. Prospect, the union representing 140,000 public and private sector workers such as engineers and managers said the larger-than-expected cuts would be a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to its members and sounded \u201cunrealistic\u201d. \u201cDecisions like this are not easy to make,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cAnd I recognise it is going to affect a lot of people.\u201d The large-scale redundancies are the biggest since 2008 and 2009 when 30,000 jobs went, largely as a result of the poor performance of its global services division. BT\u2019s share price fell as much as 8% in early trading, reflecting concern from investors at the group\u2019s forecast of lower revenue and profits this year. BT reported profits of \u00a37.5bn, down 2%, with revenue down 1% to \u00a323bn in the year to the end of March. Patterson, who has endured a torrid 18 months including an accounting scandal at BT\u2019s Italian unit that cost \u00a3530m to clean up, said the company had \u201cproved its mettle\u201d over the last year. He said successes included closing the final salary pension scheme and agreeing a multibillion-pound deficit recovery plan, legally separating Openreach and striking a new Premier League rights deal at \u00a3295m a season, saving \u00a325m annually ending years of spiralling inflation. Patterson also announced an increase of about \u00a3200m in capital expenditure to \u00a33.7bn in each of the next two years, to drive the rollout of superfast broadband and 5G mobile networks. BT said it would hold the dividend unchanged for last year and the next two years, given the outlook for earnings and cashflow, but added that it remained committed to a long-term policy of growing the dividend. The company also agreed a 13-year plan to reduce its pension deficit, which stands at \u00a311.3bn, including payments of \u00a32.1bn over three years and a further \u00a32bn to be raised from a bond issue. Patterson said that BT would also look at the sale of non-core assets and that its under-performing global services operation, which provides IT and communications services to clients ranging from the BBC to Bromley council, would be streamlined. BT is the exception as FTSE 350 firms reduce pension deficits BT\u2019s pension travails aside, Britain\u2019s biggest companies have recently enjoyed a decent run on final salary schemes. Buoyant stock markets, especially on the continent and in the US, and a rise in the interest rate paid on government bonds, which form the backbone of every pension scheme, have tended to bring final salary scheme deficits down. According to Mercer, a leading pensions consultancy, deficits at firms listed on the FTSE 350 fell to \u00a376bn at the end of last year, from \u00a384bn the year before. Rival pension consultancy Hymans Robertson, which produces more conservative estimates, said deficits across the FTSE 350 stood at about \u00a3100bn. Both figures are well down on the \u00a3137bn collective deficit seen at the end of 2016 by Mercer\u2019s calculations, illustrating how an unusual rise in both stock and bond markets last year improved pension scheme finances. Still, the improvement has a long way to go before falling back to the \u00a318.2bn FTSE 350 deficit estimated by Goldman Sachs in 2014. It was only last year that BT said its deficit was \u00a313.9bn, double the previous year\u2019s total. Since then it has fallen to nearer \u00a39bn, partly because it decided BT pensioners would die a little earlier than expected, saving about \u00a31bn, only to rise again to \u00a311.3bn. Pension schemes forecast their liabilities over a 50-year period and changes in inflation, interest rates, investment returns and life expectancy can all alter the trajectory. The rise in long-term interest rates calculated by BT\u2019s pension trustees may be a canary for other schemes and herald another rise in deficits across the board. Philip Inman",

      "bodyText": "BT often gets stick for being an over-privileged incumbent that hates the whiff of real competition, so it\u2019s almost comforting to know that its German equivalent, Deutsche Telekom, fits the caricature more precisely. Witness DT chief executive officer Tim H\u00f6ttges\u2019s wildly over-the-top reaction to the news that Vodafone is buying US group Liberty Global\u2019s cable assets in the country in a \u20ac18.4bn (\u00a316.1) deal that also involves operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. \u201cTotally unacceptable,\u201d H\u00f6ttges told Bloomberg, which described him as being \u201cvisibly worked up\u201d. One assumes he\u2019ll now mount a campaign in Berlin and Brussels to try to get the deal blocked, but it\u2019s hard to see why politicians or regulators should give him the time of day. In broadband, DT has 13.2 million customers in Germany and Vodafone\u2019s operation (with 6.5 million customers) plus Liberty\u2019s (with 3.5 million) would still be smaller in combination. H\u00f6ttges is on firmer ground in arguing that Vodafone would have a bigger share in TV, but so what? That battle is really a scrap with satellite broadcasters over transmission systems; it\u2019s not as if Vodafone is producing TV programmes. DT, as Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao pointed out, would still be in 70% of German homes, which is hardly a weak position. German politicians, one strongly suspects, will welcome stiffer competition. Like their UK counterparts, they worry that life in the broadband slow lane (at least compared with countries like Spain) carries long-term economic costs. Vodafone\u2019s promise to commit to spend heavily on \u201cgigabit\u201d infrastructure in Germany will surely be welcomed locally. This is the biggest deal Vodafone has done in years and, from the point of view of its shareholders, the terms look OK: it is paying about 11 times topline profits, roughly what the City expected. The wider moral should perhaps be drawn by the UK regulator Ofcom as it tries to promote competition in fast-fibre broadband here. DT is BT\u2019s biggest shareholder with a 12% stake and, according to the rumour mill, wants BT to pedal as slowly as possible on fibre investment in the UK. H\u00f6ttges is a non-executive director of BT. Is he on board with the UK\u2019s fibre rollout ambitions or not? Nothing illegal but Michael Cohen case does not help Novartis You would have travel a long way to find a more defensive corporate statement than Novartis\u2019 confirmation that it paid $1.2m (\u00a3885,000) to Essential Consultants, a shell company set up in Delaware by Donald Trump\u2019s attorney Michael Cohen. The $100,000-a-month payments related to \u201cUS healthcare policy matters\u201d, said the Swiss drugs group, before deciding after a single meeting that Essential would not be any help but the one-year contract couldn\u2019t be terminated early. But Vas Narasimhan, promoted to chief executive in February, had \u201cno involvement whatsoever\u201d since the deal was done before he assumed the top job. AT&amp;T is the other well-known multinational revealed to have made payments to Cohen\u2019s firm (it says it was seeking \u201cinsights into understanding the new administration\u201d) but Novartis\u2019 involvement is the most striking. Lest we forget, the Greek parliament voted two months ago to investigate 10 of the country\u2019s politicians over accusations they accepted bribes from Novartis between 2006 and 2015. The politicians have all denied the claims. Nothing illegal is alleged in the Cohen case, it should be said. But Narasimhan is a new-broom boss on a mission to make Novartis the very model of an upright corporate citizen. The US tale is not going to help. Dingemans\u2019 exit from GSK example on severance without pay Here\u2019s a rare sight: a long-serving FTSE 100 executive leaving without a payoff. At the age of 55, Simon Dingemans seems too young to retire as finance director of GlaxoSmithKline but he and the company have gone about the process in the correct manner. Dingemans informed the company of his plan, will work out a year\u2019s notice and will depart next May without a severance payment. This ought to be completely unremarkable since it is how the world works for 99.9% of the population. It is only in the corporate world that it is often deemed necessary to pay departing executives to go away when they\u2019ve chosen to leave anyway. The usual wheeze is to pretend a replacement has to be found within months, thereby triggering an obligation for the employer to cover the full notice period. The practice is a contractual outrage, of course. Severance payments for voluntary leavers are a nonsense \u2013 worse, in principle, even than bonuses schemes that pay out in all weathers. The Dingemans example, let\u2019s hope, marks a turning point.",

      "body": "<p>BT often gets stick for being an over-privileged incumbent that hates the whiff of real competition, so it\u2019s almost comforting to know that its German equivalent, Deutsche Telekom, fits the caricature more precisely.</p> <p>Witness DT chief executive officer Tim H\u00f6ttges\u2019s wildly over-the-top reaction to the news that Vodafone is buying US group Liberty Global\u2019s cable assets in the country in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/09/vodafone-strikes-18bn-deal-for-liberty-global-virgin-media-cable-and-broadband-assets\">a \u20ac18.4bn (\u00a316.1) deal</a> that also involves operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. \u201cTotally unacceptable,\u201d H\u00f6ttges told Bloomberg, which described him as being \u201cvisibly worked up\u201d.</p> <p>One assumes he\u2019ll now mount a campaign in Berlin and Brussels to try to get the deal blocked, but it\u2019s hard to see why politicians or regulators should give him the time of day. In broadband, DT has 13.2 million customers in Germany and Vodafone\u2019s operation (with 6.5 million customers) plus Liberty\u2019s (with 3.5 million) would still be smaller in combination.</p> <p>H\u00f6ttges is on firmer ground in arguing that Vodafone would have a bigger share in TV, but so what? That battle is really a scrap with satellite broadcasters over transmission systems; it\u2019s not as if Vodafone is producing TV programmes. DT, as Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao pointed out, would still be in 70% of German homes, which is hardly a weak position.</p> <p>German politicians, one strongly suspects, will welcome stiffer competition. Like their UK counterparts, they worry that life in the broadband slow lane (at least compared with countries like Spain) carries long-term economic costs. Vodafone\u2019s promise to commit to spend heavily on \u201cgigabit\u201d infrastructure in Germany will surely be welcomed locally.</p> <p>This is the biggest deal Vodafone has done in years and, from the point of view of its shareholders, the terms look OK: it is paying about 11 times topline profits, roughly what the City expected.</p> <p>The wider moral should perhaps be drawn by the UK regulator Ofcom as it tries to promote competition in fast-fibre broadband here. </p> <p>DT is BT\u2019s biggest shareholder with a 12% stake and, according to the rumour mill, wants BT to pedal as slowly as possible on fibre investment in the UK. H\u00f6ttges <a href=\"https://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Theboard/Ourboard/TimotheusHottges/index.htm\">is a non-executive director of BT</a>. Is he on board with the UK\u2019s fibre rollout ambitions or not?</p> <h2>Nothing illegal but Michael Cohen case does not help Novartis</h2> <p>You would have travel a long way to find a more defensive corporate statement than Novartis\u2019 confirmation that it paid $1.2m (\u00a3885,000) to Essential Consultants, a shell company set up in Delaware by Donald Trump\u2019s attorney Michael Cohen.</p> <p>The $100,000-a-month payments related to \u201cUS healthcare policy matters\u201d, said the Swiss drugs group, before deciding after a single meeting that Essential would not be any help but the one-year contract couldn\u2019t be terminated early. But Vas Narasimhan, promoted to chief executive in February, had \u201cno involvement whatsoever\u201d since the deal was done before he assumed the top job.</p> <p>AT&amp;T is the other well-known multinational revealed to have made payments to Cohen\u2019s firm (it says it was seeking \u201cinsights into understanding the new administration\u201d) but Novartis\u2019 involvement is the most striking. Lest we forget, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/22/greece-to-investigate-top-politicians-over-novartis-bribery-claims\">the Greek parliament voted two months ago to investigate 10 of the country\u2019s politicians over accusations they accepted bribes from Novartis between 2006 and 2015</a>. The politicians have all denied the claims.</p> <p>Nothing illegal is alleged in the Cohen case, it should be said. But Narasimhan is a new-broom boss on a mission to make Novartis the very model of an upright corporate citizen. The US tale is not going to help.</p> <h2>Dingemans\u2019 exit from GSK example on severance without pay</h2> <p>Here\u2019s a rare sight: a long-serving FTSE 100 executive leaving without a payoff. At the age of 55, Simon Dingemans seems too young to retire as finance director of GlaxoSmithKline but he and the company have gone about the process in the correct manner. Dingemans informed the company of his plan, will work out a year\u2019s notice and will depart next May without a severance payment.</p> <p>This ought to be completely unremarkable since it is how the world works for 99.9% of the population. It is only in the corporate world that it is often deemed necessary to pay departing executives to go away when they\u2019ve chosen to leave anyway. The usual wheeze is to pretend a replacement has to be found within months, thereby triggering an obligation for the employer to cover the full notice period.</p> <p>The practice is a contractual outrage, of course. Severance payments for voluntary leavers are a nonsense \u2013 worse, in principle, even than bonuses schemes that pay out in all weathers. The Dingemans example, let\u2019s hope, marks a turning point. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has agreed a $4.9bn (\u00a33.6bn) penalty with the US Department of Justice to end an investigation into sales of financial products in the run-up to the financial crisis, clearing the way for the UK government to sell its 71% stake in the bank. The RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said the agreement in principle was a milestone moment for the bank. The penalty relates to the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages in the US between 2005 and 2007. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, welcomed the agreement, saying it would help pave the way to a sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The government could start selling down its stake this year, well before the March 2019 deadline. It plans to sell \u00a315bn of shares, or two-thirds of its stake, in \u00a33bn tranches by 2022-23. The taxpayer is sitting on a loss of about \u00a326bn after the \u00a345.8bn bailout of RBS during the financial crisis. McEwan said the DOJ settlement served as \u201ca stark reminder of past behaviours of this bank that we should never forget.\u201d It was \u201cthe price we have to pay for the global ambitions pursued by this bank before the crisis.,\u201d he said. \u201cOur current shareholders will be very pleased this deal is done. It does help the government sell a cleaner bank.\u201d RBS shares rose 5.5% in early trading and later traded nearly 3% higher at 284.2p. The prospect of a large penalty had been hanging over RBS for years, making its shares hard to value. The settlement is smaller than expected. Two years ago, the body which controls the taxpayer stake said the bank could face a penalty of more than $12bn. RBS is also expected to resume dividend payouts to shareholders after ditching them a decade ago. Justin Cooper, chief executive of the share registry firm Link Market Services, said: \u201cRBS\u2019s settlement with US regulators, coupled with sharply improving profitability paves the way for the long-awaited restoration of its dividend. At first the dividend is likely to be a fraction of the \u00a3770m paid in 2007, but it will be a hugely significant milestone on the road to the bank\u2019s eventual return to the private sector.\u201d RBS reported its first annual profit in a decade in February, \u00a3752m for 2017, following a \u00a37bn loss in 2016. The penalty will take a slice out of the group\u2019s 2018 profits, but it has already set aside $3.46bn and will only take a $1.44bn charge in the second quarter. Gary Greenwood, a Shore Capital analyst, said: \u201cThis represents an excellent outcome for the group which should now open the door for the group to pass the Bank of England\u2019s stress testing exercise.\u201d He expects RBS to pay a dividend of 7.3p this year, and said there could be share buybacks to reduce the government\u2019s stake. The final agreement may take several weeks to negotiate with the DOJ, the bank said. RBS\u2019s UK rival Barclays recently struck a $2bn settlement with the DOJ. RBS\u2019s finance chief, Ewen Stevenson, said the bank had been a much larger seller of residential mortgage-backed securities in the US than Barclays. It shut that business three years ago. Deutsche Bank ended up with a $7.2bn penalty, the single largest settlement over the issue. The DOJ penalty comes after RBS\u2019s $5.5bn settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency last year, and its $500m settlement with New York state last month. This leaves a handful of small litigation cases, Stevenson said, adding the issue had been a heavy burden resulting in more than $10bn in settlement costs.",

    "webTitle": "The flat tax is really about cutting services not taxes | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In 2014 Joe Hockey made the fatal mistake out outlining his dream of $80bn worth of cuts to education and health. Scott Morrison has not been so foolish but his desire to flatten the income tax rate is just as insidious. The government\u2019s plan to cut income tax in a manner that is greatly targeted towards the wealthiest comes with a $140bn bill \u2013 one that cannot be paid with hopes and prayers about strong economic growth. Morrison\u2019s desire for a flat tax is not about cutting taxes, it is also about inevitably cutting government services in the same way Hockey desired. We probably should have seen it coming. While the treasurer might have talked of the priority of tax cuts for \u201clow to middle income earners\u201d, we should always know the deepest desire of conservative governments is to help the wealthy. The budget tax plan outlined over the next four years is nothing too astounding. The move to not increase the Medicare levy by 0.5% point is one of those tax cuts that we won\u2019t actually notice because no one has had to pay it yet. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday The decision to increase the low income tax offset (Lito) and call it the \u201clow and middle income tax offset\u201d is a sensible way to cut taxes for low and medium income earners. Unlike adjusting tax thresholds, it places a cap on who gets the tax cut. But even here we see where the government\u2019s heart really lies. Whereas the Lito currently cuts out at $66,700 \u2013 around the median full-time wage; Morrison has extended it to those earning $125,330 \u2013 at which point we are well beyond middle Australia and into the top 10%. That Morrison thinks someone earning $120,000 is in need of a \u201cmiddle income\u201d offset betrays who he really thinks needs help. While the tax offset is a rebate that you get at the end of the financial year, the government is also increasing the 37% tax threshold from $87,000 to $90,000. That means low income earners benefitting from the offset increase will have to wait till after July next year, those earning over $87,000 start getting their tax cuts from July this year. Yes it is only $135 \u2013 or $2.60 a week, but it is rather striking that the initial benefit goes to those who need it least. And yet it is all part of the bigger plan to take move Australia away from progressive taxation. Conservatives hate progressive taxation because it means wealthy people pay more tax than those on lower incomes. The proposal in July 2024 to end the 37% tax bracket and instead have everyone earning from $41,000 to $200,000 paying 32.5% income tax is not about fairness, unless you think fairness involves reducing the amount of tax paid by the wealthiest. Morrison\u2019s big argument is we need to rid ourselves of bracket creep, as though it is some evil that is haunting workers, preventing them from getting ahead. But tax thresholds have only a minor impact on incentives to earn more, because you only pay the higher level of tax on the income you earned above that threshold: In reality the biggest disincentive to earning more comes from non-income tax thresholds \u2013 such as the Hecs-Help threshold. If you earn below $55,874 you pay no Hecs, earn $55,874 and you are now paying 4% of all of your income \u2013 that actually does see your disposable income fall even though you are earning more. Similarly the Medicare levy, the draw down on family tax benefit payments, the low income tax offset and other government benefits combined means there are much larger forces at play then worrying about what is your highest marginal tax rate. And the reality is Australians don\u2019t pay a high level of income tax. The latest OECD report on taxing wages notes that Australia\u2019s average tax wedge \u2013 which \u201cmeasures the extent to which tax on labour income discourages employment\u201d \u2013 is low across all incomes: And lifting the 37% tax threshold from $87,000 to $90,000, let alone removing the 37% bracket completely, is actually not going to affect most workers. In 2017, the median earnings for a full-time worker was $65,572 a year. Even if we use Morrison\u2019s heroic assumptions that wages from 2020-21 onward will grow by 3.5%, that would see such a worker only reach $87,000 by 2025-25 and the new threshold of $90,000 a year later. The median income for all workers is currently just $52,988 \u2013 meaning they\u2019ll only hit $87,000 in 2032-33. I suspect such workers might have a few more pressing concerns than bracket creep: So if it\u2019s not really about reducing workers\u2019 incentive to earn more money, then what is the move to a flat tax rate really about? It\u2019s about giving wealthy people a whopping big tax cut. Using the figures in the budget papers, the shift would see a fall in the average rate of tax paid by those on $70,000 of 0.7 percentage points, while those earning $180,000 would drop 2.6 percentage points, and those on $200,000 would see their average rate fall a massive 3.6 percentage points: Or to put it in dollar terms, someone on $70,000 will get an extra $540 a year, while someone earning $200,000 (or 2.9 times more) will get an extra $7,225 (or 13.4 times more): Proposals to flatten the income tax rate are always about giving bigger tax cuts to those on higher incomes. And this is not cheap. In 2015-16 the roughly 400,000 people who had an incomes between $156,500 and $241,000 paid an average 32.6% tax on their income for a total of $24.7bn. Dropping that average tax rate to 29.5% would see a drop of $2.4bn in tax revenue \u2013 that\u2019s around a quarter of the cost of Newstart each year. Add in cuts from the other 2 million or so people earning over $90,000 and you are talking big money \u2013 every year. And it\u2019s why the prime minister and treasurer have refused to say how much it will cost, and are sticking with the \u201c$140bn over 10 years\u201d line \u2013 but refusing to explain what is included in that figure, let alone breaking it down to individual items. But then when you are trying to sell snake oil, you never want the customer to know the real cost. And this brings us to the second reason conservatives like flat taxes \u2013 they mean less total revenue, and thus provide an excuse to cut government services and welfare. And yet those services and benefits combined with our income tax system are fundamental to redistributing the national income and improving equality: The flat tax will massively reduce the ability to fund those services \u2013 because it massively cuts the amount of tax that can be raised not only in good times, but when the economy is growing less than it is now. He wants to, in effect, lock in the need to cut services or face large deficits. The treasurer and prime minister would have you believe their story that the budget is all good news \u2013 tax cuts and joy for \u201cworking families\u201d \u2013 but their tale has a sting. Right now the government wants parliament to vote for these tax cuts despite refusing to say how much they will cost, and how they plan on paying for them. Because you can bet the people who will pay will not be those who are getting the biggest benefit. Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "body": "<p>In 2014 Joe Hockey made the fatal mistake out outlining his dream of $80bn worth of cuts to education and health. Scott Morrison has not been so foolish but his desire to flatten the income tax rate is just as insidious. The government\u2019s plan to cut income tax in a manner that is greatly targeted towards the wealthiest comes with a $140bn bill \u2013 one that cannot be paid with hopes and prayers about strong economic growth. Morrison\u2019s desire for a flat tax is not about cutting taxes, it is also about inevitably cutting government services in the same way Hockey desired.</p> <p>We probably should have seen it coming. While the treasurer might have talked of the priority of tax cuts for \u201clow to middle income earners\u201d, we should always know the deepest desire of conservative governments is to help the wealthy.</p> <p>The budget tax plan outlined over the next four years is nothing too astounding. The move to not increase the Medicare levy by 0.5% point is one of those tax cuts that we won\u2019t actually notice because no one has had to pay it yet.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/04/best-of-comment-is-free-australia-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday</a><br></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4160\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the best of Guardian Australia opinion\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of editors' picks\" data-form-campaign-code=\"AU_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up.\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The decision to increase the low income tax offset (Lito) and call it the \u201clow and middle income tax offset\u201d is a sensible way to cut taxes for low and medium income earners. Unlike adjusting tax thresholds, it places a cap on who gets the tax cut.</p> <p>But even here we see where the government\u2019s heart really lies.</p> <p>Whereas the Lito currently cuts out at $66,700 \u2013 around the median full-time wage; Morrison has extended it to those earning $125,330 \u2013 at which point we are well beyond middle Australia and into the top 10%.</p> <p>That Morrison thinks someone earning $120,000 is in need of a \u201cmiddle income\u201d offset betrays who he really thinks needs help.</p> <p>While the tax offset is a rebate that you get at the end of the financial year, the government is also increasing the 37% tax threshold from $87,000 to $90,000. That means low income earners benefitting from the offset increase will have to wait till after July next year, those earning over $87,000 start getting their tax cuts from July this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/10/australias-high-earners-will-benefit-most-from-tax-reforms-says-thinktank\">Australia's high earners will benefit most from tax reforms, says thinktank</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes it is only $135 \u2013 or $2.60 a week, but it is rather striking that the initial benefit goes to those who need it least. </p> <p>And yet it is all part of the bigger plan to take move Australia away from progressive taxation. Conservatives hate progressive taxation because it means wealthy people pay more tax than those on lower incomes.</p> <p>The proposal in July 2024 to end the 37% tax bracket and instead have everyone earning from $41,000 to $200,000 paying 32.5% income tax is not about fairness, unless you think fairness involves reducing the amount of tax paid by the wealthiest.</p> <p>Morrison\u2019s big argument is we need to rid ourselves of bracket creep, as though it is some evil that is haunting workers, preventing them from getting ahead. But tax thresholds have only a minor impact on incentives to earn more, because you only pay the higher level of tax on the income you earned above that threshold:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Income tax rates\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tDvbB/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In reality the biggest disincentive to earning more comes from non-income tax thresholds \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/HELP,-TSL-and-SFSS-repayment-thresholds-and-rates/\">the Hecs-Help threshold</a>. If you earn below $55,874 you pay no Hecs, earn $55,874 and you are now paying 4% of all of your income \u2013 that actually does see your disposable income fall even though you are earning more.</p> <p>Similarly the Medicare levy, the draw down on family tax benefit payments, the low income tax offset and other government benefits combined means there are much larger forces at play then worrying about what is your highest marginal tax rate.</p> <p>And the reality is Australians don\u2019t pay a high level of income tax.</p> <p>The latest OECD report on <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/taxing-wages-2018_tax_wages-2018-en?itemId=/content/publication/tax_wages-2018-en&amp;_csp_=82dd7da39a5fc483a6fe924bfc33a813\">taxing wages</a> notes that Australia\u2019s average tax wedge \u2013 which \u201cmeasures the extent to which tax on labour income discourages employment\u201d \u2013 is low across all incomes:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"OECD average tax wedge, 2017 (single person)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sglyF/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And lifting the 37% tax threshold from $87,000 to $90,000, let alone removing the 37% bracket completely, is actually not going to affect most workers.</p> <p>In 2017, the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6333.0Main+Features1August%202017?OpenDocument\">median earnings</a> for a full-time worker was $65,572 a year. Even if we use Morrison\u2019s heroic assumptions that wages from 2020-21 onward will grow by 3.5%, that would see such a worker only reach $87,000 by 2025-25 and the new threshold of $90,000 a year later.</p> <p>The median income for all workers is currently just $52,988 \u2013 meaning they\u2019ll only hit $87,000 in 2032-33.</p> <p>I suspect such workers might have a few more pressing concerns than bracket creep:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Path of median workers to get to $90,000\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Xug3v/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So if it\u2019s not really about reducing workers\u2019 incentive to earn more money, then what is the move to a flat tax rate really about? It\u2019s about giving wealthy people a whopping big tax cut.</p> <p>Using the figures in the budget papers, the shift would see a fall in the average rate of tax paid by those on $70,000 of 0.7 percentage points, while those earning $180,000 would drop 2.6 percentage points, and those on $200,000 would see their average rate fall a massive 3.6 percentage points:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average tax rate by income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JwDQB/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Or to put it in dollar terms, someone on $70,000 will get an extra $540 a year, while someone earning $200,000 (or 2.9 times more) will get an extra $7,225 (or 13.4 times more):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Change in tax rates from now to proposed 2024-25 changes\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MoBjB/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Proposals to flatten the income tax rate are always about giving bigger tax cuts to those on higher incomes. And this is not cheap.</p> <p>In 2015-16 the roughly 400,000 people who had an incomes between $156,500 and $241,000 paid an average 32.6% tax on their income for a total of $24.7bn. Dropping that average tax rate to 29.5% would see a drop of $2.4bn in tax revenue \u2013 that\u2019s around a quarter of the cost of Newstart each year. Add in cuts from the other 2 million or so people earning over $90,000 and you are talking big money \u2013 every year.</p> <p>And it\u2019s why the prime minister and treasurer have refused to say how much it will cost, and are sticking with the \u201c$140bn over 10 years\u201d line \u2013 but refusing to explain what is included in that figure, let alone breaking it down to individual items. </p> <p>But then when you are trying to sell snake oil, you never want the customer to know the real cost. </p> <p>And this brings us to the second reason conservatives like flat taxes \u2013 they mean less total revenue, and thus provide an excuse to cut government services and welfare. </p> <p>And yet those services and benefits combined with our income tax system are fundamental to redistributing the national income and improving equality:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual equivalised household income by income quintile\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3Gkmr/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The flat tax will massively reduce the ability to fund those services \u2013 because it massively cuts the amount of tax that can be raised not only in good times, but when the economy is growing less than it is now. He wants to, in effect, lock in the need to cut services or face large deficits.</p> <p>The treasurer and prime minister would have you believe their story that the budget is all good news \u2013 tax cuts and joy for \u201cworking families\u201d \u2013 but their tale has a sting.</p> <p>Right now the government wants parliament to vote for these tax cuts despite refusing to say how much they will cost, and how they plan on paying for them. Because you can bet the people who will pay will not be those who are getting the biggest benefit<a href=\"xhttp://theguardian.com\">.</a></p> <ul> <li>Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist </li> </ul>",
