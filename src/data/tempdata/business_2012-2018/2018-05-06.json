The bank continues to be deluged by customers reporting long call-waiting times, frustration at delays in dealing with stolen cards, and money transfers failing to go through. One customer, \u2018Gaz_TFBS\u2019 said on Twitter that he had rung each day over four successive days but despite waiting 25 minutes each time, no one answered. Another, Hazel Allen, said she had spent two hours and 40 minutes waiting to speak to TSB\u2019s fraud team, while customer Mark Appleby said a money transfer between accounts had failed. All TSB customers remain unable to view their mortgage accounts on mobile devices or home computers, while some customers are also having problems viewing information about their next credit card payment. It said that while payments through TSB\u2019s mobile app and internet banking are available, some customers were still seeing an error message. TSB said it was unable to put a date on when the persistent bugs and outages will finally be fixed, despite hiring IBM specialists to fix the problems. A spokeswoman said: \u201cEveryone at TSB is working around the clock to fix the issues (including this bank holiday weekend). And progress is being made. \u201cOn the time frames more broadly, we\u2019re not in a position to confirm how long things may take but crucially our focus is getting things back to normal for our customers as soon as possible across. And also ensuring that no customer is left out of pocket as a result of these issues.\u201d Last week, during a bruising evidence session before the Treasury select committee, TSB chief executive Paul Pester and the bank\u2019s chairman, Richard Meddings, said they had received 40,000 complaints about the outage but did not know exactly how many of the bank\u2019s 1.9 million online customers had been affected. Meddings told MPs that Pester had volunteered to give up a \u00a32m bonus associated with the migration to a new IT system, hinting that other executives could also have their bonuses slashed. But Pester could still receive up to \u00a31.3m in other bonuses for 2018, on top of a further \u00a31.3m in basic pay, benefits and pension contributions. The accountancy firm Deloitte is advising on the bank\u2019s compensation strategy, and the City law firm Slaughter and May is to investigate the cause. The bank is also bracing itself for a regulatory fine, with a team from the Financial Conduct Authority inside TSB monitoring developments.",

      "bodyText": "Retailers and garden centres have enjoyed a much-needed boost from what is set to be the hottest early May bank holiday on record, packing the shelves with ice-cream, barbecue food, paddling pools and plants as shoppers got their first real taste of summer. Asda said sales of paddling pools were up by almost 50% as customers sought ways to keep cool, with its range of novelty gnomes the biggest driver of sales in the garden category. Waitrose said it has stocked stores for a 200% increase in bank holiday Monday barbecue meat sales and a 50% rise in orders of ros\u00e9 wine compared with the same time last year. Sainsbury\u2019s was predicting a 600% increase in ice-cream sales compared with the previous weekend, a 300% increase in gin sales, and a 280% increase in potato salad sales. Sainsbury\u2019s said: \u201cThis scorcher of a bank holiday is set to be the first proper barbecue weekend of the year. We\u2019re predicting that our ice-cream, gin and Taste of Summer barbecue staples will be real sizzlers \u2013 not to mention suncream flying off the shelves as we all head outdoors to soak up the rays.\u201d Springboard, which measures customer visits across the UK high streets, shopping centres and retail parks, forecast a 3%-4% increase in footfall this bank holiday compared with the same one last year. DIY retailer B&amp;Q said that each of its flagship stores is likely to sell well over 100 barbecues, 3,000 bags of compost, 6,000 bedding plants, 150 mowers and 125 fence panels over the weekend. \u201cAt this time of year especially, customers do respond to the weather. We tend to see a change in the type of projects they do,\u201d said Steve Guy, B&amp;Q\u2019s market director for outdoor. We look at the weather forecast for the next 14 days and make trading and stock decisions on a daily basis.\u201d Wyevale, the largest garden centre group in the UK, said it was benefiting from the weather with a surge in demand for cocktail herbs as people got a thirst for summer classics such as Pimm\u2019s and mojitos. Sales of moroccan mint are up 62% year-on-year and mint chocolate up 36%. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that herbs are the must-have plant of the season; they\u2019re fragrant, look great and are the perfect addition to summer BBQs for both drinks and dining,\u201d said Lilidh Matthews, herb buyer at Wyevale Garden Centres. \u201cThey also thrive in small spaces, and are an increasingly popular addition for city balconies and kitchen windowsills alike.\u201d Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said garden and DIY-related goods were likely to fare well because it was the first opportunity for keen gardeners to get out planting and tidying-up after weeks of poor weather. \u201cAnything related to the garden is likely to do well after such a poor Easter. People will use the opportunity to get out and do work in the garden and in the home. And of course fashion should benefit as people will want to replenish their wardrobe as the first signs of spring and summer emerge.\u201d Well-stocked smaller convenience stores were expected to be among the bank holiday winners, according to analysts at research firm Kantar Worldpanel. \u201cWhenever the mercury rises people swiftly move away from traditional meals and start focusing on the barbecue,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar\u2019s head of retail and consumer insight. \u201cIn the interests of maximising their exposure to the sunshine consumers are also much more likely to shop locally rather than travel longer distances to bigger stores, so the retailers who\u2019ve stocked up on sausages and burgers in their convenience outlets should perform well this weekend.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has abandoned a \u00a310m project to halve food waste in a designated town across Britain after a year-long trial produced miserable results. The supermarket group gave families in one town, Swadlincote in south Derbyshire, free gadgets to cut food waste \u2013 such as devices to measure the correct amount of spaghetti to cook, \u201csmart\u201d fridges to control content and temperatures more accurately, food planners and magnetic shopping lists \u2013 and monitored the results. However, the year-long experiment fell far short of its 50% target, with households believed to have cut food waste by only 9% \u2013 and telling Sainsbury\u2019s the issue was not a priority for them. The \u00a310m Waste Less, Save More programme was launched in 2015 to find out why consumers throw so much edible food away, with \u00a31m spent on an \u201cexperimental testbed\u201d in Swadlincote. The market town beat 188 areas in the UK to be awarded the project and Sainsbury\u2019s had planned to spend \u00a310m over five years to develop a network of similar schemes across the UK. But the UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket has pulled the plug on further funding, halfway through the process of giving cash to successful regional bidders. The Waste Less, Save More slogan and branding have been dropped and all the retailer\u2019s work on food waste will be absorbed into a wider \u201cwellbeing\u201d campaign. The results of the evaluation by the environmental charity Hubbub revealed that the Swadlincote project had achieved only a single-digit percentage reduction (which has not been officially published but is believed to be 9%). Hubbub waded through nearly 800 household food collection bins weighing their contents and comparing them after the trial ended. The Guardian revealed last March that the project was unlikely to hit the original target and that Sainsbury\u2019s has gone back to the drawing board to re-evaluate the scheme. The government\u2019s waste advisory body, Wrap, was monitoring the Swadlincote project. The UK churns out 15m tonnes of food waste a year \u2013 of which 7m comes from households. The estimated retail value of this waste is put at \u00a37.5bn \u2013 Wrap believes a typical family wastes \u00a3700 of food each year. \u201cWe launched Waste Less, Save More three years ago,\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s said. \u201cWe found our customers\u2019 priorities have changed and broadened, which is why reducing food waste now forms one part of what is an even bigger investment to help our customers \u2018live well\u2019 in every aspect of their lives.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s said it would continue to operate shared surplus food projects and to donate surplus food to charity through hundreds of partnerships across the UK, while any food unsuitable for human consumption would be turned into animal feed or sent for anaerobic digestion, which leads to biogas. Sainsbury\u2019s insisted the decision was not related to the merger plans with Asda. Free and low-cost solutions offered in Swadlincote included community events and schools programmes through to larger initiatives such as \u201ccommunity\u201d fridges \u2013 a fridge in a public space in which people can put in food or take out food. A rival supermarket chain is expected to provide funding for a growing national network of such fridges. Supermarkets are regularly criticised for not doing more to redistribute edible food to the needy \u2013 via food banks and charities \u2013 although Sainsbury\u2019s points out it co-founded FareShare in 1994 with the homelessness charity Crisis and supported its launch as an independent charity in 2004. Wrap declined to comment. However, Clare Oxborrow, a senior food and farming campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cFor too long the supply chain ignored this and now we have an entrenched problem to get to grips with. Food that is wasted has taken fresh water, land, energy and labour to produce and supermarkets need to show their customers the scale of the problem, and why efforts to reduce food waste deserves ongoing support. \u201cAll companies along the supply chain should publicise their food waste data and commit to concerted, long-term action, so that food waste is halved by 2030, as set out in the sustainable development goals.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Torquay, Paignton, Lancaster, Brighton and Kirkcaldy could become Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cmonopoly\u201d towns if its planned merger with Asda goes ahead, prompting MPs to demand action to protect local communities. The proposed merger of the two supermarket chains will leave little or no major supermarket competition in the towns, opening the possibility of a local monopoly and a headache for competition authorities, which could order a sell-off but find no buyers. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is expected to carefully scrutinise Sainsbury\u2019s planned \u00a37.3bn takeover of Asda under which the latter\u2019s US parent, Walmart, will become a major shareholder in the combined group. MPs raised concerns that stores might close, putting local jobs at risk, or that communities might face price rises if all nearby supermarkets come under the control of one company. \u201cYou only have to look how close the Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s are in Torquay and Paignton, said Kevin Foster, the local MP. \u201cIt does raise concerns about how long a unified company would want to operate two stores. There is also the impact this has on the ability to choose where to shop. As it stands there are only five major supermarkets in Torquay in Paignton and four of them are owned by what would be a combined company.\u201d Kirkcaldy\u2019s MP, Lesley Laird,is concerned about price rises. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s and Asda already enjoy approximately 50% of supermarket custom here in Kirkcaldy and this merger is a concern given its potential to squeeze local competitors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard there will be no store closures, but that\u2019s not legally binding for the long-term and we\u2019ve heard no assurances that the deal won\u2019t result in job losses, [or] changes to pay, terms and conditions.\u201d The issue is particularly sensitive in the Scottish town, which only recently lost a Tesco store as part of widespread closures by the UK\u2019s biggest grocer. In an investigation expected to be launched within weeks and last at least six months, the regulator is likely to examine hundreds of local areas to ensure competition is maintained. A key question will be whether only large traditional supermarkets such as Tesco and Morrisons are true competitors, or if discounters such as Aldi and Lidl or online players such as Ocado and Amazon can now provide a viable alternative in local areas. In Brighton, where the three major supermarkets consist of two branches of Sainsbury\u2019s and an Asda, the local MP, Caroline Lucas, said the merger would further decrease choice. \u201cIt is small businesses that provide the economic backbone to Brighton and Hove, and I know many people will be worried that this merger could further entrench the power of supermarkets and put our local economy at risk. The merger also risks driving down standards and wages for farmers, and further reducing other workers\u2019 salaries. The CMA should reject this bid, and the government should urgently investigate measures to reduce the power of supermarkets,\u201d she said. Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s also dominate in Asda. Cat Smith, the MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said: \u201cIf there is such a monopoly for Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda then there\u2019s limited choice and smaller players like Booths will struggle against that. That\u2019s a worry, given that Booths is a Lancashire company founded in Blackpool with a headquarters in Preston. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the impact further down the supply chain, especially as so many in my constituency are in the business of producing food.\u201d When the regulator considered the merger of Morrisons and Safeway in 2003, it divided grocery competition into three categories; one-stop supermarkets with a sales area of more than 1,400 sq metres [15,000 sq ft], mid-sized stores with an area of 1,400 to 2,800 sq metres, and local convenience stores. For the largest stores it looks for similar competitors within a 10-minute drive in urban areas or a 15-minute drive in rural communities. If the combined business has too big a share of the market it can force the sale of stores to a restricted list of strong competitors, but with sales at many large supermarkets falling back there are concerns that strong bidders may be few and far between. Until very recently the regulator had not considered discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, which typically stock fewer than 3,000 different products, as sufficient competition for a full-scale supermarket, which usually stocks more than 30,000 items. But in its assessment of Tesco\u2019s recent merger with Booker, the regulator hinted that it had now changed its view. Foster said the matter should be considered carefully. \u201cI accept the market has changed, particularly with growth of online retail, but it has not changed fundamentally,. A large number of people still go every week and do a large shop,\u201d he said. The MPs\u2019 comments come after members of two influential parliamentary committees called on the competition regulator to examine how the merger of Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda would affect suppliers.",

As it stands there are only five major supermarkets in Torquay in Paignton and four of them are owned by what would be a combined company.\u201d</p> <p>Kirkcaldy\u2019s MP, Lesley Laird,is concerned about price rises. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s and Asda already enjoy approximately 50% of supermarket custom here in Kirkcaldy and this merger is a concern given its potential to squeeze local competitors,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard there will be no store closures, but that\u2019s not legally binding for the long-term and we\u2019ve heard no assurances that the deal won\u2019t result in job losses, [or] changes to pay, terms and conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The issue is particularly sensitive in the Scottish town, which only recently lost a Tesco store as part of widespread closures by the UK\u2019s biggest grocer. </p> <p>In an investigation expected to be launched within weeks and last at least six months, the regulator is likely to examine hundreds of local areas to ensure competition is maintained. A key question will be whether only large traditional supermarkets such as Tesco and Morrisons are true competitors, or if discounters such as Aldi and Lidl or online players such as Ocado and Amazon can now provide a viable alternative in local areas.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In Brighton, where the three major supermarkets consist of two branches of Sainsbury\u2019s and an Asda, the local MP, Caroline Lucas, said the merger would further decrease choice. \u201cIt is small businesses that provide the economic backbone to Brighton and Hove, and I know many people will be worried that this merger could further entrench the power of supermarkets and put our local economy at risk. The merger also risks driving down standards and wages for farmers, and further reducing other workers\u2019 salaries. The CMA should reject this bid, and the government should urgently investigate measures to reduce the power of supermarkets,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s also dominate in Asda. Cat Smith, the MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said: \u201cIf there is such a monopoly for Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda then there\u2019s limited choice and smaller players like Booths will struggle against that. That\u2019s a worry, given that Booths is a Lancashire company founded in Blackpool with a headquarters in Preston.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about the impact further down the supply chain, especially as so many in my constituency are in the business of producing food.\u201d</p> <p>When the regulator considered the merger of Morrisons and Safeway in 2003, it divided grocery competition into three categories; one-stop supermarkets with a sales area of more than 1,400 sq metres [15,000 sq ft], mid-sized stores with an area of 1,400 to 2,800 sq metres, and local convenience stores. For the largest stores it looks for similar competitors within a 10-minute drive in urban areas or a 15-minute drive in rural communities.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>If the combined business has too big a share of the market it can force the sale of stores to a restricted list of strong competitors, but with sales at many large supermarkets falling back there are concerns that strong bidders may be few and far between.</p> <p>Until very recently the regulator had not considered discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, which typically stock fewer than 3,000 different products, as sufficient competition for a full-scale supermarket, which usually stocks more than 30,000 items. But in its assessment of Tesco\u2019s recent merger with Booker, the regulator hinted that it had now changed its view.</p> <p>Foster said the matter should be considered carefully. \u201cI accept the market has changed, particularly with growth of online retail, but it has not changed fundamentally,. A large number of people still go every week and do a large shop,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The MPs\u2019 comments come after members of two influential parliamentary committees called on the competition regulator to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/03/asda-sainsburys-merger-mps-fear-squeeze-on-supplier\">examine how the merger of Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda would affect suppliers</a>.</p>",

According to a Sunday Times report, a senior executive from Amazon pushed for a formal meeting, but was blocked by JLP\u2019s board. Amazon\u2019s move into the UK grocery sector two years ago, with the launch of the online delivery service Amazon Fresh, has long prompted speculation among City analysts that it could be interested in buying a more established UK supermarket chain. Its $13.7bn (\u00a310.12bn) purchase of the organic food chain Whole Foods Markets last summer was seen as a statement of its ambitions, earning it about 460 stores, including nine in the UK, where Whole Foods has operated since 2004. The proposed \u00a315bn Asda\u2013Sainsbury\u2019s merger to create a new grocery superpower has been seen as attempt to fight off the increasing threat from Amazon. According to the Sunday Times, the attempt to open talks with Waitrose was made by Ajay Kavan, vice-president of special projects at Amazon. Kavan reportedly had several \u201cenormously informal\u201d conversations last November with an unnamed director of JLP about a possible deal .

      "bodyText": "The City has had the date ringed in the diary for months. On Thursday the Bank of England is supposed to raise interest rates, taking them above 0.5% for the first time in almost a decade. It\u2019s not going to happen. A deluge of weak data over the past month has surprised the Bank. It has badly misread the economy, and not for the first time. The message had previously been clear. There was a limit to how long inflation above the government\u2019s 2% target could be tolerated at a time when the steady fall in unemployment was likely to lead to stronger wage pressure. The City knew what was meant when the Bank talked about the need for an \u201congoing tightening\u201d of policy. In the past few weeks, however, it has emerged that growth came to a virtual standstill in the first quarter of 2018 and, judging by the first business surveys for April, has not picked up much since. Inflation has come down more quickly than expected. The housing market is dead. Consumers are reluctant to spend. Demand for credit is weak. The idea that the Bank of England would increase the cost of borrowing in the current circumstances is fanciful. In 21 years of operational independence, the Bank has never cut interest rates when the latest estimate of the quarterly growth rate was below 0.4%. The financial markets have moved on. They now think the Bank will signal on Thursday that the rate rise has not been abandoned, merely postponed for three months until there is more evidence of the economy recovering and wage pressure building. The monetary policy committee has a credibility problem though, and anything it says should be taken with a very large pinch of salt. Its inability to forecast the economy accurately undermines its attempts to provide forward guidance over the future path of interest rates. Any one who thinks the MPC is simply waiting for August to move should recall that the February inflation report said interest rates would need to rise \u201csomewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent\u201d than it had anticipated at the end of 2017. Growth was then expected to come in at 0.3% in the first quarter even after the weather disruption, but it was actually 0.1%. Looking at the data, there is actually a stronger case for interest rates being cut than there is for them being raised. In part that\u2019s because the government\u2019s fiscal policy \u2013 the Treasury\u2019s combination of public spending and tax decisions \u2013 is still holding growth back. Philip Hammond eased austerity when he became chancellor, but did not abandon the strategy pursued by his predecessor, George Osborne. As the National Institute for Economic and Social Research pointed out last week, public spending as a share of GDP has come down from 45.1% in 2009-10 to an estimated 38.9% in 2016-17. But although spending is already below its postwar average of 39.3% of GDP, the government\u2019s plans further falls to 37.6% by 2022-23. There will be no let up as Hammond pursues his goal of balancing the budget by the middle of the next decade. In its latest quarterly review, NIESR has used four factors \u2013 existing spending commitments, the proportion of the population over 85, the growth rate and the UK\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio \u2013 to estimate the amount of public spending that previous postwar governments would have chosen if confronted by today\u2019s circumstances. The thinktank calls this \u201cwarranted\u201d spending because it reflects the historic choices made by democratically elected governments in the past. Using this approach, it found that the pace of deficit reduction was slower than its estimate of that warranted during the 2010 to 2015 parliament but that since 2014-15 it has been more stringent than it should have been. Using the same approach to look at individual areas of public spending, the thinktank found that even the NHS \u2013 which has had its budget ringfenced \u2013 has been treated too harshly. It estimates that in 2016-17, the health sector needed extra funding of around \u00a3440 a head. Spending was also below warranted levels in education, public order and safety and social care. \u201cThe government will find it hard to resist pressure to restore the quality of public services in these areas,\u201d NIESR concludes. A few eyebrows will be raised at the idea that George Osborne\u2019s austerity programme was not tough enough during the years of the coalition government, particularly among economists of a Keynesian bent, but it is hard to dispute the NIESR argument that austerity fatigue has now set in. The public sector is having trouble recruiting staff and voters are starting to fret about the quality of public services. Hammond says deficit reduction is needed so that the public finances are in decent enough shape to cope when another recession comes along. Some in the City are urging the Bank to raise interest rates for the same reason. Self-evidently it would be better to face another downturn with the government in the black and official interest rates at 5% rather than 0.5%, because it would give the Treasury and the Bank more policy space. But the idea that the MPC needs to raise rates and that Hammond should be cutting public spending \u2013 especially when it is so cheap to borrow \u2013 in order to stockpile ammunition to deal with the next recession is daft. The point of economic policy is to prevent recessions, not to cause them by tightening policy when it is unnecessary. That\u2019s not prudence. It\u2019s self-flagellation.",

The public sector is having trouble recruiting staff and voters are starting to fret about the quality of public services.</p> <p>Hammond says deficit reduction is needed so that the public finances are in decent enough shape to cope when another recession comes along. Some in the City are urging the Bank to raise interest rates for the same reason.</p> <p>Self-evidently it would be better to face another downturn with the government in the black and official interest rates at 5% rather than 0.5%, because it would give the Treasury and the Bank more policy space.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But the idea that the MPC needs to raise rates and that Hammond should be cutting public spending \u2013 especially when it is so cheap to borrow \u2013 in order to stockpile ammunition to deal with the next recession is daft. The point of economic policy is to prevent recessions, not to cause them by tightening policy when it is unnecessary. That\u2019s not prudence. It\u2019s self-flagellation.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney has already faced accusations of behaving like the Grand old Duke of York and he will probably do so again should Britain\u2019s central bank opt to keep interest rates on hold. Since he joined the Bank in 2013, he has marched borrowers and savers up the hill with heavy hints about the imminent prospect of a rate rise, only to march them back down again. Last November\u2019s restoration of 2016\u2019s emergency rate cut hardly qualified as a major move, whatever the Bank said about its significance. Until an interview with the BBC during the IMF spring meetings a fortnight ago, it seemed to be a racing cert that the Bank was finally ready to begin the long journey back to 3% and push the base rate from 0.5% to 0.75%. The markets were guided to expect action at a meeting of the monetary policy committee on Thursday. And it wasn\u2019t just Carney dropping hints. Almost every member of the committee who had previously blocked a rise had gone on the record arguing that the time for a rate increase was near at hand. Speeches by external member Jan Vlieghe constituted the most startling intervention. During 2016 and much of 2017, the former hedge fund economist turned interest-rate setter was one of the most vociferous opponents of a rise. His former brethren in the Square Mile considered him an arch dove who might never vote to increase rates, such was his downbeat view of the economy\u2019s growth potential. Yet, towards the end of last year, he was one of the most optimistic proponents of the economy\u2019s resilience and the likelihood of a rate rise. Just as before, a moment of central bank exuberance looks like becoming a non-event \u2013 which is strange given Vlieghe\u2019s reasoning for backing an increase last year. Then, he said that ultra-low unemployment, steady growth and the probable end to a long period of declining real wages was enough to justify tighter monetary policy. None of those things has changed. Unemployment remains the lowest it has been since the 1970s, at 4.2%, and is expected to stay that way for the foreseeable future. Growth, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP) data, is expected to show continued expansion with no prospect of a recession on the horizon. And inflation should decline this year, to leave consumer incomes in a healthier position. There is no doubt that the prospect of wages outstripping inflation this year and next was a key element of Vlieghe\u2019s and Carney\u2019s argument. And it looked as if their resolve would be stiffened by a piece of the Bank\u2019s own analysis that argued Brexit was having a bigger effect than previously thought. A tight labour market, denied its regular injections of overseas workers, would overheat more quickly than before, sending wages spiralling. It meant that a growth rate of more than 1.5% would now be considered inflationary \u2013 compared with the previous 2.5%. Then came a slew of figures showing that the economy might struggle to achieve even 1.5% growth this year and next. Wage increases, which were supposed to become stratospheric, were stuck on the ground. Surveys last week of the construction, manufacturing and services sector showed them all expanding, but at a snail\u2019s pace. If Bank of England officials were truly dedicated to the cause of higher rates \u2013 if only to have something to cut in the event of a downturn \u2013 they would see through the spring dip and press ahead. So a reasonable conclusion must be that their hearts were never in the project \u2013 and that rates will stay low for a very long time.",

I don\u2019t know about the managers of Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United or Arsenal, but J\u00fcrgen Klopp, hero of Liverpool, has said loud and clear that he cannot understand why this country should be heading for the Brexit cliff. For the terrible prospect now, as the so called \u201cnegotiations\u201d with our European partners proceed nowhere slowly, is that unless someone exercises serious leadership soon, there is quite possibly going to be an almighty political and social crisis. The progress of the \u201cnegotiations\u201d was well summarised for Llewellyn Consulting recently by the veteran British expert on all things to do with the EU, Peter Ludlow. He described phase one of the negotiations as \u201cnot so much a negotiation as a managed and semi-camouflaged retreat\u201d. The promises made, and concessions demanded, by the Brexiters of whom our hapless prime minister is so terrified have been scattered like ninepins. But the leading Brexiters are content to absorb one blow after another in order to realise their fantasy of \u201cregaining control\u201d \u2013 provided that control is not exercised by the parliament whose sovereignty they regard as sacred, except when it doesn\u2019t suit them. I have already reported the finding by Bettergovgroup that \u201cthere is now widespread public recognition that the referendum was flawed and that people were not given the relevant facts\u201d. This is hardly surprising when one realises that our former ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, had to explain to the leading Brexiters in the cabinet after the referendum what the customs union and single market actually were. If there was this level of ignorance among the people in the vanguard of the charge towards the cliff, it is no surprise that so many ordinary citizens, with so much else on their minds, have little idea either. They could do worse than read an article by the former mayor of New York, and founder of the financial news organisation that bears his name, Michael Bloomberg. Much of the current controversy surrounds the question of what, if any, customs union there should be. However, retaining the customs union is a necessary, but by no means sufficient, condition if we are to avoid serious disruption to our everyday lives, and an almost guaranteed reduction in standard of living. As Bloomberg reminds us, the customs union is essentially about common tariffs. It is the single market \u2013 championed by no less a heroine to the Brexiters than Margaret Thatcher \u2013 that allows frictionless commerce with the EU, all of which would be seriously disrupted by the restriction of free movement of goods and people that would be inflicted by a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. For, make no mistake, we are part of a European economy. Bloomberg writes about the cliff-edgers: \u201cLed by a government lacking faith in its own policy, they\u2019ve failed to give any remotely plausible account of how their preferred hard Brexit can succeed.\u201d Leaving would be like unscrambling a vast economic omelette. As Bloomberg epitomises it: \u201cThe Brexit vote was a mistake, and ought to be reversed now, not later.\u201d I could not agree with him more, or with Klopp, who says Brexit \u201cmakes no sense at all \u2026 let\u2019s vote again with the right information\u201d. For me, the geopolitical case for not disrupting Europe at any time \u2013 and certainly not at a time like this \u2013 is overwhelming. But it is the economic damage that ought to get through to people. In the London Review of Books, political scientist David Runciman, whose views I usually respect, suggests that \u201ca decision to reverse the Brexit vote would \u2026 have serious consequences for national prestige\u201d. Sorry, but the Brexit vote has itself had serious consequences for national prestige. A parliamentary vote to reverse it would demonstrate that at last we have seen sense. At which point I should emphasise that I do not wish to \u201cbadmouth\u201d the many ordinary citizens who voted for Brexit. But I do think they were not informed about what was at stake. We are already seeing the damage in the difficulty the NHS, which depends heavily on immigrant employees, is having with recruitment. The Road Haulage Association agrees with what the EU\u2019s Michel Barnier has said: falling out of the EU would bring chaos at the ports and airports and severe disruption to supply chains. Some people say that to question \u201cthe will of the people\u201d would cause social disruption. But I suspect that dropping out of the customs union and the single market would make memories of the three-day week and \u201cwinter of discontent\u201d in the 1970s look like a vicarage tea party.",

(\u201cHe beat me because my jockstrap was too tight and because when he serves he farts,\u201d Ndefwayl explained.) All of which brings us to what defence William Hill might employ this week when the old bookmaker takes its turn to update the market on trading. Paddy Power\u2019s argument was that its punters had lost so much money by the first part of the reporting period that they had been put off betting. Combined with the chill of the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d, the business was knocked sideways. William Hill has been operating in an identical environment so, one assumes, will have faced similar pressures. But there are far more pressing issues for the firm than seasonal fluctuations, which tend to even out over the long term. First, we are approaching the point (possibly on Thursday) where a decision will be made on stakes allowed on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) \u2013 the addictive gambling games in UK bookmaking shops. Last month, shares in the UK\u2019s biggest bookmakers fell sharply on reports that chancellor Philip Hammond had accepted the need for a \u00a32 maximum FOBT stake \u2013 which, if true, analysts at Canaccord reckon would hit William Hill profits by a further \u00a365m. Second, William Hill shares are so depressed at the moment that the City reckons that the whole company is in play \u2013 just as a trend is emerging for consolidation in the industry. Sky Bet has just been sold to Canada\u2019s Stars Group \u2013 the owner of the PokerStars online cardroom \u2013 in a deal said to have created the largest publicly listed online gaming company in the world. Third, and perhaps most intriguingly, the US betting market is nearing a watershed liberalisation moment (again), as the supreme court considers whether to repeal the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (Paspa), which effectively outlaws sport betting across much of the US. A decision is expected any time between now and the end of June. Curiously, considering the amount of excuses William Hill has had to trot out of late, it has a decent story to tell here. It owns a sizeable operation in Nevada, where sports betting is permitted, operating more than half the casino sports books there. It also has a betting operation ready to go in New Jersey in partnership with Monmouth Park racecourse and says it could be ready to take bets \u201cwithin days\u201d. The firm is in negotiations with potential partners in several states and believes the US could eventually become its most profitable territory. Still, veteran industry watchers will know that bookmakers have been talking about US liberalisation \u2013 and the fortune it is going to make them all \u2013 for decades. It has never quite come to pass, although there has always been an excuse for that too.",
