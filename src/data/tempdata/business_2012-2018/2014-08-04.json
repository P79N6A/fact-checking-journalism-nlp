      "bodyText": "Hewlett-Packard (HP) has said former Autonomy chief executive Michael Lynch should be \"held accountable\" as it accused the founder of the UK software company of fraud in a court filing on Monday. In a dramatic escalation of the war of words between the US group and the tech entrepreneur, HP said it would also sue Autonomy's ex-chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain. Hussain is seeking to block HP's settlement of three shareholder lawsuits over its troubled purchase of the British software company. Hussain is trying to block the settlement, saying HP officials were wrongly absolved in the ill-fated acquisition of Autonomy for $11.1bn (\u00a36.6bn) in 2011. HP wrote down Autonomy's value by $8.8bn (\u00a35.2bn) a year later and accused Autonomy officials of accounting fraud, which those executives have denied. In the settlement, shareholders had agreed to end efforts to force current and former HP officials, including chief executive Meg Whitman, to pay damages to HP over its Autonomy purchase. Instead, the shareholders agreed to help HP pursue claims against former Autonomy officials such as Hussain and former CEO Michael Lynch, who have denied wrongdoing. \"The notion that (Hussain) should be permitted to intervene and challenge the substance of a settlement designed to protect the interests of the company he defrauded is ludicrous,\" HP said in a court filing. \"The shareholder plaintiffs who originally sued HP's directors and officers now agree that Hussain, along with Autonomy's founder and CEO, Michael Lynch, should be held accountable for this fraud.\" Last month, Hussain said in a court filing that the \"collusive and unfair\" settlement, if approved by a federal judge, would let HP \"forever bury from disclosure the real reason for its 2012 write-down of Autonomy: HP's own destruction of Autonomy's success after the acquisition.\" \"This breathless ranting from HP is the sort of personal smear we've come to expect.

He said: \"In the 16 months that have followed [since the value of Autonomy was written down], HP has not provided information or evidence to the Autonomy team to substantiate any allegation. Instead, it has selectively leaked documents and information to the international media, frequently using material taken out of context to create false impressions and smear our reputations.\" Lynch also claims that HP was aware of certain Autonomy sales practices months before it told shareholders that a whistleblower had raised the alarm.

    "webTitle": "HSBC chairman warns against banking reforms", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of HSBC warned yesterday that fear of hefty fines was forcing banks to become risk averse as they grapple with unprecedented regulatory reforms in the wake of the financial crisis. As Britain's biggest bank revealed it was putting aside $367m (\u00a3218m) to cover compensation for mistakes in loan statements to UK customers, Douglas Flint said there was an \"observable and growing danger of disproportionate risk aversion\". He warned of \"growing fatigue\" in some of the bank's operations, where staff were having to work at weekends to implement systems changes. One concern was that \"there are only 52 weekends in a year\". He made his remarks as the bank, which makes two-thirds of its profits in Asia, reported a 12% fall in first-half profits to $12.3bn and published 10 pages of warnings about the litigation and regulatory fines it could face on an array of matters ranging from the collapse of the Madoff empire to the fixing of prices in currencies and gold and silver. Some of these fines could be \"significant\", the bank added. Flint outlined a list of regulatory changes that the bank was facing, including implementing a ringfence between its retail banking and \"casino\" investment arms \u2013 demanded by UK regulators from 2019. He would not comment on the letter he has written to the chancellor, George Osborne, calling for a delay to the 2019 deadline, which the bank said involves costs amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds a year. \"I do not think we have ever had to ask so much of so many,\" said Flint. \"The demands now being placed on the human capital of the firm and on our operational and systems capabilities are unprecedented.\" The bank employs 256,000 people around the world, down from the 300,000 employed three years ago when Stuart Gulliver, - whose motto is \"courageous integrity \" - took over as chief executive. Two years ago the bank was fined \u00a31.2bn by the US for breaching US sanctions and allowing Mexican drug lords to launder money through the financial system, making it subject to tougher scrutiny from US authorities. Last week it faced criticism for closing the accounts of three Muslim organisations, including the Finsbury Park mosque in north London, and it has previously closed accounts for diplomatic staff. Flint said the increased focus on conduct and financial crisis was the right response to problems in the past. \"There is, however, an observable and growing danger of disproportionate risk aversion creeping into decision-making in our businesses as individuals, facing uncertainty as to what may be criticised with hindsight and perceiving a zero-tolerance of error, seek to protect themselves and the firm from future censure.\" He called for clarity from watchdogs over their expectations. \"Unwarranted risk aversion threatens to restrict access to the formal financial system to many who could benefit from it... and risks unwinding parts of the ecosystem of networks and relationships that support global trade and investment,\" he said. The bank took a $194m hit to cover compensation for customers miss-sold payment protection insurance, the industry's biggest scandal with costs topping \u00a324bn. It also listed the $119m costs incurred from an investigation into potential tax avoidance by US clients. The new $367m charge for failing to comply with the Consumer Credit Act makes HSBC the latest bank to fall foul of this regulation following a warning from the Office of Fair Trading last year about incorrect documents sent to customers who, in HSBC's case, were not told annually that they could make partial repayments of loans. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chair of the Treasury select committee, who chaired the parliamentary commission on banking standards that called for the \"electrification\" of the ringfence, to break banks up if they failed to comply with the rules, said: \"We must ensure the momentum behind the crucial reforms both on ringfencing and on electrification is not lost. They are in any case half a decade away from completion. \"It is equally important that in implementing them the regulators exercise judgment to minimise the regulatory burden. In the end everyone loses from excessive regulation.\" As is usual, the bank held its dividend flat, but because it is set in dollars, which have fallen against the pound, Justin Cooper of Capita Asset Services said: \"UK investors will see their cheque shrink by around 8% when it lands on the doormat in October.\" The shares rose 1% to 635p. Gulliver said UK interest rates could start to rise from their historic lows in the fourth quarter of this year, which would help bolster profits. \"Overall, one gets the sense that HSBC is busy tightening the ship \u2013 getting costs screwed down, refining their customer propositions, and making sure that their various regulators are happy \u2013 so that they are best-positioned for the global recovery,\" said Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The troubled Co-operative Group has sold its farms business to the Wellcome Trust for \u00a3249m in the latest attempt by the debt-laden mutual to shore up its finances. The Co-op said the sale of the 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of land, 15 farms and around 130 residential and commercial properties would be used to cut debt and invest in its remaining businesses. The sell-off was a key part of the strategy put in train by Euan Sutherland, the former chief executive who quit in March when details of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal were leaked. The group, which reported losses of \u00a32.5bn in the year to April 2014, is now focusing on supermarkets, funeral homes, general insurance and legal services after offloading its pharmacies business for \u00a3620m. The UK's largest mutual still has a for sale tag hanging over its securities business, Sunwin, as it scrambles to raise cash to reduce its debt. The farm sell-off has created controversy as some critics fear it will end more than 100 years of ethical farming by the Co-op. The Wellcome Trust, a charitable foundation, said it would be a responsible landowner, although it will not sign up to the Co-op's ethical guidelines. Peter Pereira Gray, managing director of investments at the Wellcome Trust, said: \"The Co-operative has its own form of ethics; we wouldn't necessarily seek to be exactly replicating theirs. We have our own very high standards.\" The Wellcome Trust has \u00a31.8bn of property investments. Its charity focuses on human and animal health. It said it would continue to employ the Co-op farm unit's 240 staff. Some 70% of Co-op farm production is cereals sold to other companies and it says just 2% of the produce goes to its food stores. The farms will continue to sell produce to the Co-op. \"We are buying it as a going concern; we hope to maintain all the relationships both with suppliers and customers,\" Pereira Gray said. He added that the Wellcome Trust's \"way of working would be more responsible than those looking to make a quick profit\". The trust has pledged to maintain existing services for local communities such as the educational programme for children \u2013 Farm to Fork. The Co-op insisted early on in the sale process that it wanted a single major corporate buyer, arguing this would best preserve the jobs of those employed on the farms. That angered campaigners, who had hoped the Co-op would consider community farm buyouts. Acknowledging wide interest in farmland as an investment, Pereira Gray said: \"Mark Twain's remark that 'they are not making any more land' is a good underpinning reason why farmland is attractive.\" He said the Co-op land is \"on the whole\" of very high quality. There will be some relief that the land has not fallen into foreign hands. Prime British farmland is seen as a safe bet by foreign investors, having risen in value by 273% over the past decade to an average price of \u00a321,500 per hectare, according to Savills. It is understood that the Co-op achieved a price of \u00a326,500 per hectare with this deal. The Wellcome Trust has owned agricultural land for many years but this deal represents a huge increase in its holdings. Pereira Gray said: \"This is a different scale of acquisition for us.\" The Co-op started buying farms in the late 19th century to ensure a supply of food for its grocery stores and has built up the largest lowland farming business in the UK. The overhaul of the Co-op is taking place amid attempts to embark on sweeping changes to the way the business is run. A special general meeting of members is expected to be called over the next four weeks \u2013 after the group publishes its interim results \u2013 to vote on changes to the boardroom structure and the way members' voices are heard in the organisation. As soon as this week, the outline of the reforms to be put to the member vote could be published. The proposals are expected to include changes to the ideas recommended by Lord Myners, the former City minister called in by Sutherland to overhaul governance. Myners, who quit in the face of opposition to his reforms, had said the board should no longer be made up entirely of elected members of the Co-op and should comprise members of the management and independent non-executives. However, concessions are expected to be offered to allow elected members to sit on the board. Transitional arrangements for the new board could mean that existing members, including chair Ursula Lidbetter, retain their positions on a \"senate\" overseeing the board until May 2016.",

It is understood that the Co-op achieved a price of \u00a326,500 per hectare with this deal.</p> <p>The Wellcome Trust has owned agricultural land for many years but this deal represents a huge increase in its holdings. Pereira Gray said: \"This is a different scale of acquisition for us.\"</p> <p>The Co-op started buying farms in the late 19th century to ensure a supply of food for its grocery stores and has built up the largest lowland farming business in the UK.</p> <p>The overhaul of the Co-op is taking place amid attempts to embark on sweeping changes to the way the business is run. A special general meeting of members is expected to be called over the next four weeks \u2013 after the group publishes its interim results \u2013 to vote on changes to the boardroom structure and the way members' voices are heard in the organisation.</p> <p>As soon as this week, the outline of the reforms to be put to the member vote could be published. The proposals are expected to include changes to the ideas recommended by Lord Myners, the former City minister called in by Sutherland to overhaul governance. Myners, who quit in the face of opposition to his reforms, had said the board should no longer be made up entirely of elected members of the Co-op and should comprise members of the management and independent non-executives.</p> <p>However, concessions are expected to be offered to allow elected members to sit on the board. Transitional arrangements for the new board could mean that existing members, including chair Ursula Lidbetter, retain their positions on a \"senate\" overseeing the board until May 2016.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fresh concerns have been raised about shortages of bricks and bricklayers after housebuilding picked up at the fastest pace for more than a decade last month. The resurgent building activity and strong order books helped the UK construction sector add jobs at a record pace but also saw builders' costs rise as subcontractors hiked their rates and the prices of key building materials rose sharply. The warnings came alongside a generally upbeat picture of the construction sector, which is continuing its recovery after a torrid time in the recession. Activity across civil engineering, housebuilding and commercial construction taken together continued to expand quickly in July, according to the Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI report. The activity reading for the construction sector, which makes up around 6% of the economy, slipped to 62.4 from 62.6 in June. That was above the 50-mark separating expansion from contraction and beat the consensus forecast for 62.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit said the report added to other signs the UK is \"enjoying another period of strong economic growth\". But he highlighted signs of price pressures coming from the construction sector. \"The survey also fires some warning shots in relation to inflation. Rates charged by subcontractors are rising at a near-record pace and prices paid for construction materials are also increasing sharply,\" said Williamson. \"Dwindling availability of construction materials, especially bricks, is feeding through to higher prices in many cases. Delivery times for materials from suppliers lengthened markedly again in July, and have shown the greatest deterioration ever seen by the survey in recent months.\" The survey echoed recent reports about soaring pay rates for bricklayers and long waiting times for bricks. Suppliers have been under pressure to keep up with demand, scrambling to boost capacity and reopen plants mothballed in the recession. \"Survey respondents widely commented on low stocks and capacity shortages at suppliers,\" the PMI report said. But brick manufacturers countered that \"bricks have always been available\" and production is running ahead of new housebuilding projects. The Brick Development Association cited figures showing housing starts were up an annual 10% between January and May this year while for the same period, UK domestic brick production was up by 25%. \"With over 1,500 brick types in the UK, some types may have been in short supply in the short term, but this has not been the case with the more expensive bricks which have always been readily available,\" said the group's chief executive Simon Hay. He said brick manufacturers were now working at a speed that was no different to pre-recession times. \"It just means that specifiers, contractors and procurement departments have to plan in advance again and not expect the brick of their choice to be available at a week's notice,\" added Hay. The government seized on the construction survey as evidence the sector was \"bouncing back\" after the housing crash \"led to the loss of a quarter of a million construction jobs\". \"Through the Help to Buy scheme almost 40,000 households have now achieved their dream of becoming homeowners and helped housebuilding increase to its highest level since 2007,\" said housing minister Brandon Lewis. Housebuilding was the big driver for construction in July as activity rose at the fastest pace since November 2003 on the back of strong demand for new housing and \"favourable funding conditions\", the PMI survey said. Overall, hiring in the construction sector picked up at the fastest pace since the survey began in April 1997.",

While no doubt the Co-op will say that it has achieved a good price on the sale, this is yet another disposal that diminishes the group. The deal comes less than a month after the Co-op's pharmacy business was offloaded to cash-and-carry company Bestway for \u00a3620m. Secondly, the Co-op might have got even more for its assets had it not been particularly choosy about who it sold to. There would have been plenty of potential foreign buyers attracted by the near 300% rise in the price of prime farmland in the past 10 years but the Co-op sought buyers with the same sort of values as its own. It deserves to be commended for that. Finally, given the scale of the Co-op's losses, it didn't have an awful lot of choice. Most of the \u00a32.5bn loss last year was the result of the grotesque mismanagement of its banking arm, and this had to be covered by the group. Writing down the value of the Somerfield food chain by \u00a3226m contributed to what Richard Pennycook, the acting chief executive, rightly called a disastrous year.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, clearly thinks he is the new Winston Churchill. Announcing the bank's half-yearly results, Flint conjured up the spirit of 1940 to describe the strains on his staff caused by the need to comply with tougher regulations imposed on the financial sector since the great crash of 2007-08. Perhaps it was the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the first world war that inspired Flint to say: \"I do not think we have ever had to ask so much of so many.\" Whatever it was, it was wrong at every level. Wrong war. Wrong comparison. Wrong battle to fight. Let's be clear. The reason banks now face tougher regulation is because they abused the old soft touch regime. They rigged the Libor market. They mis-sold their customers insurance policies. In HSBC's case, they banked the money for a Mexican drug cartel. And, oh yes, they were collectively responsible for the near-collapse of the global economy in the Autumn of 2008. At that point, when many of them - although not HSBC - needed money from the taxpayer to survive, the banks were all humility and contrition. They assumed, though, that the mood of extreme public anger would dissipate and that if they laid low it would be possible to regroup and push back against some of the more radical reform proposals. So it has proved. The banks were relieved that the Vickers Commission of 2011 did not propose the break-up of banks into retail and investment arms, but rather insisted that there should be a \"ring fence\" between the two. The next stage in the campaign has been to delay the implementation of ringfencing for as long as possible.

Announcing the bank's half-yearly results, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/04/markets-tense-after-portugal-bank-bailout-live#block-53df42dee4b09de5a9852c83\" title=\"\">Flint conjured up the spirit of 1940 to describe the strains on his staff</a> caused by the need to comply with tougher regulations imposed on the financial sector since the great crash of 2007-08.</p> <p>Perhaps it was the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the first world war that inspired Flint to say: \"I do not think we have ever had to ask so much of so many.\" Whatever it was, it was wrong at every level. Wrong war. Wrong comparison. Wrong battle to fight.</p> <p>Let's be clear. The reason banks now face tougher regulation is because they abused the old soft touch regime. They rigged the Libor market. They mis-sold their customers insurance policies. In HSBC's case, they banked the money for a Mexican drug cartel. And, oh yes, they were collectively responsible for the near-collapse of the global economy in the Autumn of 2008.</p> <p>At that point, when many of them - although not HSBC - needed money from the taxpayer to survive, the banks were all humility and contrition. They assumed, though, that the mood of extreme public anger would dissipate and that if they laid low it would be possible to regroup and push back against some of the more radical reform proposals.</p> <p>So it has proved. The banks were relieved that the Vickers Commission of 2011 did not propose the break-up of banks into retail and investment arms, but rather insisted that there should be a \"ring fence\" between the two. The next stage in the campaign has been to delay the implementation of ringfencing for as long as possible. The current deadline is 2019: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/04/hsbc-chairman-warns-against-ringfence-banks\" title=\"\">not long enough for Flint, who has told George Osborne he needs more time</a>.</p> <p>The chancellor should have no truck with this.

The government decided to end its three-year bailout program without requesting any additional line of credit from the EU/IMF, as rapidly falling sovereign interest rates allow the country to support its financing needs through issuance on bond markets. Nonetheless, these favourable financing conditions cannot be taken for granted, particularly as fragilities remain evident, including weak domestic demand, high unemployment, persistent deflationary risks, a fragile banking system and ongoing fiscal consolidation. <br></p> <p>Moreover, the debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at a very high level of 129% in 2013 and is expected to stabilize at this level in 2014. Similarly, some concerns remain regarding the needed further fiscal consolidation as Portugal\u2019s Constitutional Court rejected some austerity measures in June. EH expects the fiscal deficit to continue to drop in the coming quarters, and to reach -3% of GDP by 2015. However, developments in public finance will be strongly dependent on the ability of Portugal (and the eurozone) to maintain investor confidence and keep interest rates low. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53df766ae4b0f95786e44fef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-04T12:07:07.115Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The departure of Spencer Dale from the Bank of England is a blow to Mark Carney\u2019s ambition to break down silos at the institution, according to HSBC\u2019s chief economist Simon Wells.</p> <p>Here is his verdict:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spencer Dale, the BoE\u2019s executive director for financial stability and its former chief economist, is leaving the UK\u2019s central bank after a long career there.

The cumulative workload arising from a regulatory reform programme that is unfortunately increasingly fragmented, often extra-territorial, still evolving and still adding definition is hugely consumptive of resources that would otherwise be customer facing. Add to this recent obligations to perform highly granular multiple stress tests which are inconsistent in definition and scenarios between major jurisdictions and so require considerable duplication of effort; recently announced significant wholesale market practice and competition reviews in the UK; re-organising the financial, operational and structural framework of the Group to respond to evolving thinking on cross-border resolution protocols; and, finally, planning what will be a multi-year project to separate and establish the ring-fenced bank in the UK, and the dimension of the execution risk is obvious.</p> <p> To be clear, we are committed and resourced to deliver all of the above. But there is extremely limited spare capacity. Prioritisation, which is clearly critical, will require support and guidance from public policy and regulatory bodies, particularly in the UK, regarding the juxtaposition of the recently announced competition review and preparation for the creation of the ring-fenced bank. Equally important is delivery of the stated intention of the Financial Stability Board and the G20 to seek to draw a close on fresh regulatory initiatives by the end of this year.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p>He also complains of \u201cgrowing fatigue\u201d among staff as well as increasing cost pressures on salaries.<strong><br></strong></p> <p> Flint also seems to think it is \u2018job done\u2019 when it comes to legal penalities sending the banks a lesson. HSBC agreed to pay US regulators $1.9bn in 2012 over money-laundering charges.</p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong><br></strong>We continue to make good progress with implementing Global Standards, aiming to deliver a consistent approach to risk management, particularly in relation to financial crime risk. Success will be reflected in reduced incidence and severity of future customer redress and less exposure to regulatory and legal penalties. Recent high profile financial penalties and legal proceedings initiated against individuals are serving their intended purpose of highlighting the risks, both to shareholders\u2019 capital and to staff held responsible, of future infringement. Today, no-one in our industry can fail to be aware of the heightened expectations of society regarding the role of banks in supporting economic activity; nor can they be unaware of the potential penalties for failing to live up to these expectations, particularly regarding conduct issues or breach of trust</p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong><br></strong>Greater focus on conduct and financial crime risks at all levels of the firm globally is clearly the right response to past shortcomings. There is, however, an observable and growing danger of disproportionate risk aversion creeping into decision-making in our businesses as individuals, facing uncertainty as to what may be criticised with hindsight and perceiving a zero tolerance of error, seek to protect themselves and the firm from future censure.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53df420ae4b0092d799601cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-04T08:22:41.973Z\">9.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A few headlines from HSBC, from the wires:<br></p> <ul> <li>Growth in Latin America remains muted.</li> <li>Middle East business continues to perform well, but overshadowed by uncertainty.</li> <li>We remain broadly positive about economic growth for majority of our home and priority markets.<br></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53df4165e4b09de5a9852c81\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-04T08:17:52.127Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Breaking news: HSBC pre-tax profits down 12% at $12,340m for the first half of the year.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53df3b09e4b0092d799601c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-04T08:04:35.676Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fighting talk from a Russian billionaire over US sanctions this morning.</p> <p>Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch who is currently under US sanctions, said western punitive measures would not turn Russian business against President Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Timchenko is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick mid-afternoon summary: Portugal has agreed a near \u20ac5bn bailout for Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, one of its largest lenders. A \u201cbad\u201d bank will be created to house BES\u2019s toxic assets. The government has claimed taxpayers\u2019 money is not at stake, but economists are not convinced. The UK housebuilding sector is growing at its fastest rate in more than 10 years, but now faces a shortage of bricks. HSBC chairman Douglas Flint has hit out at regulation intended to shore up financial stability. Spencer Dale is quitting the Bank of England after a quarter of a century at Threadneedle St to work for BP. Finally, some recommended reading: remember the quiet glory of the old soldiers of Whitehall. More WW1 commemorations on the Guardian\u2019s news liveblog. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for following and commenting. Plenty of backslapping at the prime minister\u2019s palace in Athens today, as Jean-Claude Juncker turns up to offer support for Greece\u2019s government. Juncker, who takes up his post of European Commission president on 1 November, played down talk of debt relief for Greece to ease its debt burden. He said he \u201cfought like a lion\u201d to keep Greece in the eurozone, but also warned that the crisis was not over. We have covered a huge distance but we have not yet reached the end...Certainly, many developments, events show us how fragile the situation is not only in Greece but elsewhere. But there are also positive signs, also in Portugal. On Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo We are not yet fully out of the tunnel, and I wouldn\u2019t want to give the impression that we\u2019ve left all the ills behind but there has been a lot of progress...I fully trust Portuguese authorities that they will solve the problem they are facing in the financial sector. Quotes via Reuters, AP. Over in Washington around 50 leaders are gathering for the first-ever US-Africa summit. The Wall Street Journal has put together this helpful explainer to the meeting. Following his visit to Africa last summer, Mr. Obama wanted to follow up with a gathering that would help the U.S. reinforce its economic and diplomatic ties with the continent. The European Union has held a similar events for several years, while China has become a much bigger trading partner for Africa than the U.S. \u201cWe chose to do this summit to send a very clear signal that we are elevating our engagement with Africa,\u201d Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, told journalists last week. \u201cWe see enormous opportunities in Africa as it continues to advance its own economic development. The IMF has forecast that growth in sub-Saharan Africa will reach 5.5% this year. After Russia annexed Crimea earlier this year, government officials urged patriotic citizens to take their holidays at the Black Sea resort to help boost the local economy. That plan hit a snag today, after budget carrier Dobrolet announced it was suspending all flights as a result of EU sanctions. Passengers hoping to fly between Moscow and the Crimean capital Simferopol were confronted with this message on the company\u2019s website. Dobrolet is part of state-owned Aeroflot and flew its maiden flight, from Moscow to Simferopol, in June. Last week the EU added the airline to its sanctions list: Dobrolet is a subsidiary of a Russian state-owned airline. Since the illegal annexation of Crimea Dobrolet has so far exclusively operated flights between Moscow and Simferopol. It therefore facilitates the integration of the illegally annexed Autonomous Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation and undermines Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. Dobrolet said it had been forced to cancel flights because of the cancellation of an aircraft leasing agreement with Boeing. Separately, a Russian tour operators\u2019 association has said around 27,000 Russian tourists need to be evacuated from abroad after Russian tour firm Labirint suspended business. Labrint cited the negative political and economic situation. The bailout of Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo was not a surprise to anyone who had been following Portugal\u2019s troubled banking sector. Portugal left its bailout programme in May, but continues to face huge economic challenges. Credit insurer Euler Hermes highlighted the risks of Portugal\u2019s fragile banking system in June, in a survey of the economy. Although the Portuguese economy is growing again, the country faces a toxic mix of problems including deflationary pressure and unemployment. Here are key points from Euler Hermes chief economist Daniela Ordonez: In May, Portugal was the second country (after Ireland) to exit the joint EU/IMF bailout program. The government decided to end its three-year bailout program without requesting any additional line of credit from the EU/IMF, as rapidly falling sovereign interest rates allow the country to support its financing needs through issuance on bond markets. Nonetheless, these favourable financing conditions cannot be taken for granted, particularly as fragilities remain evident, including weak domestic demand, high unemployment, persistent deflationary risks, a fragile banking system and ongoing fiscal consolidation. Moreover, the debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at a very high level of 129% in 2013 and is expected to stabilize at this level in 2014. Similarly, some concerns remain regarding the needed further fiscal consolidation as Portugal\u2019s Constitutional Court rejected some austerity measures in June. EH expects the fiscal deficit to continue to drop in the coming quarters, and to reach -3% of GDP by 2015. However, developments in public finance will be strongly dependent on the ability of Portugal (and the eurozone) to maintain investor confidence and keep interest rates low. The departure of Spencer Dale from the Bank of England is a blow to Mark Carney\u2019s ambition to break down silos at the institution, according to HSBC\u2019s chief economist Simon Wells. Here is his verdict: Spencer Dale, the BoE\u2019s executive director for financial stability and its former chief economist, is leaving the UK\u2019s central bank after a long career there. He leaves just over two months after starting a new role in the BoE\u2019s financial stability area. This was intended to improve connectivity around the BoE and, we also suspect, to bring more structure to macroprudential policy. Therefore his departure is potentially a setback to Mark Carney\u2019s strategic plan for the BoE and creates a vacancy on the BoE\u2019s [Financial Policy Committee] at an important time. Given his vast knowledge of the UK economy, we think his departure is a loss to the BoE. Readers interested in how Britain dealt with a financial panic in 1914 should take a look at the Bank of England\u2019s unpublished history of the war years and immediate aftermath. John Osborne, part time personal assistant to BoE governor Montagu Norman and author of the Bank\u2019s war history, described how monetary policymakers feared a bank run in 1914. On Tuesday, the 4th*, Great Britain entered the war and on this day also a Conference, lasting three days, began between the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Lloyd George ) , Members of the Cabinet and Representative Bankers and Traders. This Conference was chiefly occupied with the proposed general moratorium and the provisions for suppling the Bankers with Currency Notes by Friday, the 7th, when they were to re-open o the Public and when it was feared considerable demands might be made upon them. Large amounts of gold were sent from America to help shore up the Bank of England\u2019s finances. One junior Treasury official, John Maynard Keynes, reflected the economic orthodoxy of the time. After World War I Keynes made his name arguing against that \u2018barbarous relic\u2019, but in 1914 he described the importance of maintaining the gold standard. Even if the Bank of England had been exposed to a foreign drain of gold, or to the risk of it it would have been a shameful abandonment of the Bank\u2019s traditions to have refused to pay out gold so long as any substantial quantity of it was still available. A suspension of specie payments, the English have been taught to believe, is a last, and not a first, resort. On an unshaken belief in the tenacity of this tradition the international position of the City of\u2019 London \u201clargely depends; and weakness on this point in the early days of the crisis, however great the danger, might have preluded a vast loss of future prestige. The BofE has opened its archives and Osborne\u2019s full history can be read online. Brewin Dolphin, another City institution, is also remembering the enormous cost of the war in human lives. Brewin was just one City firm whose partners played a major part in the Great War. 1600 stockbrokers joined up in 1914, creating the London Stock Exchange Battalion of Royal Fusiliers (unofficially known as the Stockbrokers). Four hundred stockbrokers failed to return. Barclays remembers employees who died in World War I With ceremonies to commemorate World War I going on in Britain and Belgium, George Osborne has recalled the forgotten banking crisis of 1914. The chancellor also paid tribute to the 102 Treasury civil servants who died in the conflict. In an article in the Financial Times he described how 50 countries experienced bank runs or market crashes as the July crisis turned into war. For six weeks, almost all the world\u2019s stock exchanges were closed. \u201cThe credit system upon which the business of this country is founded has completely broken down,\u201d an aide wrote to David Lloyd George, first of the three wartime chancellors. \u201cIt may be impossible to finance the great expenditure which the country may be forced to incur. The Treasury was forced to adopt extreme measures. Wartime tax revenues quadrupled. Levies on everything from tea and cocoa to coffee and beer were raised. Hat importers were slapped with an excise duty, only to be let off the hook when civil servants could not say what counted as a hat. Income taxes were increased and a version of corporation tax was brought in. Civil servants were also on the front line. Inside the Treasury building on Horse Guards Road a war memorial bears the names of 102 men, once workers in this building, who fought and died in that terrible war. In this centenary year especially we honour them. It is right that we should. But let us not forget the work and ingenuity of those who toiled in London while their countrymen fought abroad. Andrew Bonar Law, the last of the wartime chancellors, reflected with pride on the Treasury\u2019s effort in August 1918. \u201cFinance in war is not spectacular,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt does not appeal so vividly to the imagination . . . . [but it is] if not the most striking, by no means the least important of our achievements in the common cause.\u201d He was right. For then, as now, national security is built on economic security. Here is more on the departure of Spencer Dale from the Bank of England. The Bank said: Spencer has decided to pursue a new path in his career, as Chief Economist of BP plc. He will start his new position on 27 October 2014, after a post-employment cooling off period. Dale joined the bank in 1989. He rose though the ranks to become chief economist, but left the monetary policy committee not long after the arrival of Mark Carney and his new broom. In his leaving statement Dale regretted that he could not \u201chave stayed longer to contribute more\u201d. It has been a huge privilege to serve the Bank of England over the past 25 years. It has also been an honour and a pleasure to work with so many talented people committed to serving the public good. This is a tremendous institution that has changed remarkably since I joined, and whose additional responsibilities mean it has a central role in ensuring economic and financial stability for the UK. To truly make the most of these new powers, I fully support the Bank\u2019s objective to act as a single, cohesive policy institution. I will miss the Bank greatly and I wish I could have stayed longer to contribute more. But the opportunity to work in a different environment with one of the UK\u2019s pre-eminent companies was simply too good an opportunity to refuse. In his tribute, Carney said Dale had made \u201cthis institution stronger \u2013 as a loyal and respected colleague, effective and supportive manager, and first rate policymaker\u201d. More change at Threadneedle Street. The Bank of England has announced that Spencer Dale, its executive director for financial stability strategy and risk, is standing down. Dale had only taken up this position on 1 June 2014, after serving 6 years on the Monetary Policy Committee as the Bank\u2019s chief economist. He leaves to become BP\u2019s chief economist. Megan Greene, chief economist at Maverick Intelligence, is not convinced by the Portuguese authorities\u2019 claim that taxpayers will not lose out through the Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo bailout. This graph tells the story of the UK construction industry over the last decade. Construction output has grown solidly over the last 15 months, after a sharp fall during the financial crisis. The purchasing managers\u2019 survey was 62.4 in July, on a scale when anything over 50 counts as expansion. Douglas Flint, the HSBC chairman, who has just issued a long screed bemoaning the costs of banking regulation, has been speaking to journalists. Here are some of the Reuters snaps: HSBC chairman says \u201ca lot to do\u201d to meet 2019 deadline for UK ringfence, UK competition review could further complicate process. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver is also on the call: HSBC CEO says UK ringfence would cost \u201chundreds of millions of pounds a year\u201d and a very \u201csubstantial\u201d initial cost. HSBC CEO says no need to change strategic plan; disposals programme is mostly complete, confident revenues will pick up. For background: here is our Sunday story by City editor Jill Treanor. I wrote in a previous post about the \u00a340,000 bricklayer... that was a big understatement. According to one property consultant quoted in Sun in April the best bricklayers can earn much more. Day rates in London are up to \u00a3150-\u00a3200 ($334, \u20ac242) a day [now] and those that are particularly experienced and industrious, laying up to 1,000 bricks a day can earn the equivalent of \u00a3100,000 a year. Stefan Friedhoff, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank commercial banking, says the fall in the rate of growth in July needs to be seen in context July was still the 15th consecutive month of increased construction output, indicative of the sector\u2019s continuing return to health following the recession and the steady stream of positive news in the wider economy.... The industry will remain cautious. While output is up, so are costs and reports of shortages of labour, with the inevitable knock-on effects this brings. Against this background it is perhaps not surprising to see some moves towards consolidation in the sector as construction firms look to put themselves in the best possible position to prosper. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, points out that construction is only a small part of the UK\u2019s economic output. Construction output only accounts for 6.3% of GDP. Much attention will now be focused on the purchasing managers\u2019 survey for the dominant services sector for July which comes out on Tuesday. The services sector has been driving UK growth (it expanded 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter) so the July services purchasing managers survey will provide important evidence as to whether UK growth is losing a little momentum.... The robust construction purchasing managers\u2019 maintains uncertainty over when the Bank of England will first edge up interest rates, given that it follows a softer manufacturing survey. It remains a very close call as to whether the Bank of England will act at the end of this year or hold off from raising interest rates until early-2015. Much will clearly depend on what happens with wage growth over the coming months as well as the economy\u2019s overall performance. What is certain is that the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.50% at the end of the August MPC meeting on Thursday. A little under a year ago, there was plenty of talk of the \u00a340,000-a-year bricklayer. In July construction firms continued to report rising rates for workers. Here is Tim Moore at Markit again: Looking ahead, a pressing concern for construction companies is the availability of materials and suitably skilled labour to support the recent growth streak. Cuts to supplier capacity have ushered in the worst period of input delivery delays since the survey began in 1997, while this summer has also been notable for construction firms reporting near-record increases in rates commanded for sub-contracted work. PMI highlights Growth was strongest among in the residential building sector, although commercial construction slowed; July saw the steepest rise in residential building since November 2003; The rate of job creation was the fastest since the survey began in April 1997; Construction firms are having to wait longer for materials, with costs rising in July. Construction may have fallen back in July, but the overall pace of growth remains the fastest since 2007. Tim Moore, Senior Economist at Markit and author of the Markit/CIPS Construction PMI July\u2019s figures suggest the UK construction sector is enjoying its strongest cyclical upswing since the global financial crisis, while a new record rise in employment highlights that construction firms are increasingly confident about the sustainability of the upturn. The UK construction industry slowed down in July, according to monthly figures from the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The index was 62.4%, down on the previous month, although slightly ahead of expectations. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast 62%. Breaking news: UK construction PMI falls to 62.4 v 62.6 in June. Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, is clearly unhappy with the regulation the bank has to comply with. The demands now being placed on the human capital of the firm and on our operational and systems capabilities are unprecedented. The cumulative workload arising from a regulatory reform programme that is unfortunately increasingly fragmented, often extra-territorial, still evolving and still adding definition is hugely consumptive of resources that would otherwise be customer facing. Add to this recent obligations to perform highly granular multiple stress tests which are inconsistent in definition and scenarios between major jurisdictions and so require considerable duplication of effort; recently announced significant wholesale market practice and competition reviews in the UK; re-organising the financial, operational and structural framework of the Group to respond to evolving thinking on cross-border resolution protocols; and, finally, planning what will be a multi-year project to separate and establish the ring-fenced bank in the UK, and the dimension of the execution risk is obvious. To be clear, we are committed and resourced to deliver all of the above. But there is extremely limited spare capacity. Prioritisation, which is clearly critical, will require support and guidance from public policy and regulatory bodies, particularly in the UK, regarding the juxtaposition of the recently announced competition review and preparation for the creation of the ring-fenced bank. Equally important is delivery of the stated intention of the Financial Stability Board and the G20 to seek to draw a close on fresh regulatory initiatives by the end of this year. He also complains of \u201cgrowing fatigue\u201d among staff as well as increasing cost pressures on salaries. Flint also seems to think it is \u2018job done\u2019 when it comes to legal penalities sending the banks a lesson. HSBC agreed to pay US regulators $1.9bn in 2012 over money-laundering charges. We continue to make good progress with implementing Global Standards, aiming to deliver a consistent approach to risk management, particularly in relation to financial crime risk. Success will be reflected in reduced incidence and severity of future customer redress and less exposure to regulatory and legal penalties. Recent high profile financial penalties and legal proceedings initiated against individuals are serving their intended purpose of highlighting the risks, both to shareholders\u2019 capital and to staff held responsible, of future infringement. Today, no-one in our industry can fail to be aware of the heightened expectations of society regarding the role of banks in supporting economic activity; nor can they be unaware of the potential penalties for failing to live up to these expectations, particularly regarding conduct issues or breach of trust Greater focus on conduct and financial crime risks at all levels of the firm globally is clearly the right response to past shortcomings. There is, however, an observable and growing danger of disproportionate risk aversion creeping into decision-making in our businesses as individuals, facing uncertainty as to what may be criticised with hindsight and perceiving a zero tolerance of error, seek to protect themselves and the firm from future censure. A few headlines from HSBC, from the wires: Growth in Latin America remains muted. Middle East business continues to perform well, but overshadowed by uncertainty. We remain broadly positive about economic growth for majority of our home and priority markets. Breaking news: HSBC pre-tax profits down 12% at $12,340m for the first half of the year. Fighting talk from a Russian billionaire over US sanctions this morning. Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch who is currently under US sanctions, said western punitive measures would not turn Russian business against President Vladimir Putin. Timchenko is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. He was one of the first Russians to come under western sanctions, after the US Treasury Department said his company, Gunvor Group, had financial links to Putin. In an interview with the state news agency Itar Tass, he said it was \u201cnaive\u201d to think western sanctions would force a change in Russian policy. Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin) is only thinking about the interest of Russia. Full stop. There can be no compromise here. And it won\u2019t even cross our (businessmen\u2019s) minds to speak out about this subject. Quote via Reuters He also boasted that sanctions would not stop him flying to Paris, Geneva or London, although he has had to switch credit cards after the sanctions blocked him from using Mastercard or Visa. Portugal\u2019s main stock market, the PSI 20, is flat this morning after the turbulence of recent days. The PSI 20 has been fluctuating around zero and is currently 0.27% up. Elsewhere on European markets, it is a similar story. FTSE 100 + 0.25% at 6696 points France\u2019s CAC 40 +0.38% at 4218 points Germany\u2019s DAX -0.05% at 9206 points Remember that $9bn fine US authorities handed out to France\u2019s BNP Paribas? As part of the deal BNP pleaded guilty to violating sanctions against Iran, Sudan and Cuba, but French politicians were outraged at the size of the penalty. Now France has gained backing from the UK, Germany and Italy to challenge US regulators from imposing such heavy fines, according to a report in today\u2019s Financial Times. According to the FT bank fines will be discussed at a G20 meeting of world leaders in Brisbane, Australia in November. Here is a flavour of the FT article (metred paywall). French officials did not dispute BNP\u2019s wrongdoing but have questioned the scale of the punishment and the principle of the US extending its legal reach over all foreign banks that deal in dollars. BNP had broken no French or European law. \u201cThere should be co-ordination between regulators, as there should not be multiple jeopardy,\u201d agreed one senior European official, who confirmed that there had been \u201cinformal discussions\u201d about putting the issue of bank fines on the G20 agenda. This is not just a question of solidarity. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank are also facing a possible fine over sanctions violations. Interesting news from Turkey, ahead of the country\u2019s first direct presidential elections on Sunday. Statistics out this morning show inflation is running at 9.32% year-on-year. Economists had been expecting that number to dip below 9%, but soaring food costs are pushing the numbers the other way. HSBC will be publishing results in just over an hour and is expected to reveal an 11% fall in profit, as a result of falling revenues, lower income from its Latin American and investment banking businesses. Here is a preview of the numbers from Reuters: HSBC\u2019s pretax profit fell 20% year-on-year in the first quarter and Europe\u2019s biggest bank, which operates across 75 countries, should make a second quarter pretax profit of about $5.7 billion, similar to a year ago, underpinned by better margins in Hong Kong and growth in commercial banking profits. But that will leave earnings in the first six months overall at $12.5 billion, down from $14.1 billion a year ago, according to the average of 15 analysts polled by the bank. Reuters also reminds us that HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver is halfway through a turnaround plan that has seen 40,000 jobs gone and 60 businesses sold or closed. Over the weekend, we learned that HSBC is lobbying the government to delay new rules intended to ensure financial stability. HSBC chairman calls for halt on rules ringfencing high-street business Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. European investors have woken up to another bank rescue this morning, after troubled Portuguese lender Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo received an emergency bailout over the weekend. Portugal is putting almost \u20ac5bn into Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo as part of a bailout plan that will see the bank divided into a good bank for its healthy business and a bad bank for its toxic assets. So far, so familiar, but Carlos Costa, the governor of Portugal\u2019s central bank (pictured), has said that taxpayers\u2019 money is not at risk. The plan carries no risk to public finances or taxpayers. The rescue is mostly funded using leftover funds from Portugal\u2019s EU- IMF bailout. The bailout plan was agreed in rapid negotiations over the weekend, triggered by the bank\u2019s report of a bigger than expected loss of \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) that wiped out its capital buffers and sent its shares falling by more than 75% before the stock was suspended on Friday. The European Commission, which approved the plan, concluded that \u201ca disorderly resolution of BES could create a serious disturbance in the Portuguese economy\u201d. It said: The adoption of this resolution measure is adequate to restore confidence in financial stability and to ensure the continuity of services and avoid potential adverse systemic effects. But many observers think problems continue to lurk in the eurozone\u2019s banking system. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets observes: We are told that this problem is likely to remain a fairly contained one, but if anyone truly believes that then they are truly kidding themselves. With the European Central Banks (AQR) Asset Quality Review well under way, this bail out or recapitalisation, is unlikely to be the last, if these EU mandated stress tests are to be treated as in any way credible. Aside from all the latest from Portugal, we are also looking out for HSBC\u2019s results at 9.15 GMT and UK PMI construction data for July. I\u2019ll be following that and all the latest.",

      "bodyText": "It may not be as palatable as one of its merlots, but a sweetened A$3.4bn (\u00a31.87bn) offer from private equity giant KKR has tempted the world's second-largest winemaker to open its books. Australia's Treasury Wine Estates, which rejected a A$3.1bn unsolicited offer from KKR and Rhone Capital in May, said the 11% increase in the price meant it was now \"in the interests of shareholders to engage further\". The move raises the prospect of a bidding war for Treasury, which owns the Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Beringer brands. China's Bright Food Group, France's Pernod Ricard and the world's biggest winemaker, US-based Constellation Brands, are all considered potential buyers. Shannon Rivkin, director at Rivkin Securities, told Reuters: \"Absolutely there are [rival bidders], they've now set a starting point for the price. This is going to be the point now where anyone who has any interest will be able to have a look at the books as well.\" The new offer is a 5% premium on Treasury's share price on Friday. Treasury's shares have fallen from an all-time high a year ago as it slashed earnings forecasts and suffered oversupply problems in its US arm and sluggish sales in China. Treasury had a dreadful 2013, when profits slumped 38% in the six months to February. But the company is turning round its fortunes with an ongoing restructuring plan, bolstered by Asia's growing appetite for wine and the value of the Penfolds label. The winemaker stressed that it was providing KKR and Rhone with \"non-exclusive\" access to its books for due diligence and that there was no certainty any offer would be forthcoming. Rivkin said KKR may take fright after looking at Treasury's books. \"I think this is a starting bid, once they have a look through, if there are any issues there that the market's not aware of they could still very easily walk away.\" Treasury's woes reflect problems in the broader Australian wine industry, which has struggled through volatile market conditions and a high currency exchange rate in recent years. Treasury \u2013 which posted sales of A$1.7bn in the 2013 financial year \u2013 has tried to stave off takeovers by cutting costs and installing a new chief executive, Michael Clarke, in April. His predecessor, David Dearie, was sacked in September last year after presiding over a A$160m charge following the destruction of thousands of gallons of cheap wine exported to the US. An efficiency drive imposed by Clarke is expected to generate A$35m in savings in the 2015 financial year by shedding jobs and reducing office space, IT and non-essential spending. The company is scheduled to release full-year results later this month.",

      "standfirst": "<p>Welfare\u2019s share of total spending has fallen over the past decade and Australians are less welfare-dependent, not more</p>", 
      "body": "<p>The release of the<a href=\"http://indigenousjobsandtrainingreview.dpmc.gov.au/forrest-review\"> Forrest review</a> into Indigenous training and employment contains numerous interesting recommendations to improve Indigenous employment opportunities, but his recommendation for welfare provided through income management for all welfare holders is based on what has become a persistently false view of social security in Australia.</p> <p>Forrest\u2019s report is certainly very well meant and there is no doubting his desire to see improvements in the lives of Indigenous peoples. The report contains some good suggestions and points of view \u2013 especially with regard to training leading to a job, rather than just training for the sake of it.</p> <p>But the report and statements he has made betray a view of welfare as a negative that needs to be reduced and which holds back rather than helps people. It\u2019s a view based on ignorance rather than facts.</p> <p>In Saturday\u2019s the Weekend Australian, Forrest wrote an opinion piece explaining his report and approach. The article<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/we-have-a-mutual-obligation-to-end-the-welfare-trap/story-e6frg6zo-1227010740214\"> began</a> by setting out his foundation position on welfare in Australia: \u201cOne-third of all government spending is on welfare and welfare-related social security. That\u2019s a massive $131bn last year and growing year by year.\u201d</p> <p>This figure is often spouted by politicians and commentators as being significant and suggests that welfare spending is out of control. But,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/jun/16/joe-hockey-alls-fair-in-welfare-and-budgets\"> as I noted</a> in June, when the same line was put forward by Joe Hockey, it\u2019s rather meaningless.</p> <p>Yes, $131bn was spent last year on welfare and yes, it will grow. But that\u2019s because both inflation and population growth inherently lead to inevitable \u2018year by year\u2019 growth in nominal government expenditure (and also that of private businesses).</p> <p>But welfare funding as a percentage of government expenditure has actually fallen over the past decade. And the overwhelming reason social security spending is expected to grow at all over the next four years (and beyond) is because of the increase in the age pension. Take those away and social security spending as a proportion of the total government expenditure remains quite flat:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/UBajo/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Forrest then followed up his opening sentence with an even more misguided second statement:</p> <p>\u201cAustralia is becoming welfare-dependent and each of us must bear responsibility. Welfare is becoming a destination and a trap for too many of our fellow Australians.\u201d</p> <p>Now I love impassioned policy advocacy \u2013 but not when it is based on such ignorance.</p> <p>Australians are not becoming welfare dependent. </p> <p>As I noted<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/jun/19/australian-men-housework-leaners-survey\"> in June</a>, the latest<a href=\"http://www.melbourneinstitute.com/downloads/hilda/Stat_Report/statreport-v9-2014.pdf\"> Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia</a> (Hilda) survey showed that fewer households and individuals are dependent on welfare now than 10 years ago:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/9hDtC/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Similarly, as the most recent data from the<a href=\"http://www.dss.gov.au/about-the-department/publications-articles/research-publications/statistical-paper-series/statistical-paper-no-11-income-support-customers-a-statistical-overview-2012\"> Department of Social Services</a> shows, the percentage of Australians on any form of welfare has also fallen over the past decade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grog3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/HSMvT/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And finally, as ANU\u2019s<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhitefordPeter/status/494671164975747076\"> Peter Whiteford</a> has noted, based on the Hilda survey, 65% of all households received some form of welfare between 2001 and 2011, but only 11.4% of households received welfare in each of those years. And a mere 3% of households received over half of their total income during that period from welfare.</p> <p>In short: Australians are becoming less welfare dependent, and people on welfare do not get trapped. People go on welfare, and then overwhelmingly get off it.</p> <p>These opening lines reveal Forrest\u2019s philosophical view on welfare, and it flows through into his suggestion that people should have their income managed through use of a \u201chealth welfare card\u201d. This card would limit the things on which people could spend their money. But it wouldn\u2019t just limit it to food, rent and utilities.

      "bodyText": "The release of the Forrest review into Indigenous training and employment contains numerous interesting recommendations to improve Indigenous employment opportunities, but his recommendation for welfare provided through income management for all welfare holders is based on what has become a persistently false view of social security in Australia. Forrest\u2019s report is certainly very well meant and there is no doubting his desire to see improvements in the lives of Indigenous peoples. The report contains some good suggestions and points of view \u2013 especially with regard to training leading to a job, rather than just training for the sake of it. But the report and statements he has made betray a view of welfare as a negative that needs to be reduced and which holds back rather than helps people. It\u2019s a view based on ignorance rather than facts. In Saturday\u2019s the Weekend Australian, Forrest wrote an opinion piece explaining his report and approach. The article began by setting out his foundation position on welfare in Australia: \u201cOne-third of all government spending is on welfare and welfare-related social security. That\u2019s a massive $131bn last year and growing year by year.\u201d This figure is often spouted by politicians and commentators as being significant and suggests that welfare spending is out of control. But, as I noted in June, when the same line was put forward by Joe Hockey, it\u2019s rather meaningless. Yes, $131bn was spent last year on welfare and yes, it will grow. But that\u2019s because both inflation and population growth inherently lead to inevitable \u2018year by year\u2019 growth in nominal government expenditure (and also that of private businesses). But welfare funding as a percentage of government expenditure has actually fallen over the past decade. And the overwhelming reason social security spending is expected to grow at all over the next four years (and beyond) is because of the increase in the age pension. Take those away and social security spending as a proportion of the total government expenditure remains quite flat: Forrest then followed up his opening sentence with an even more misguided second statement: \u201cAustralia is becoming welfare-dependent and each of us must bear responsibility. Welfare is becoming a destination and a trap for too many of our fellow Australians.\u201d Now I love impassioned policy advocacy \u2013 but not when it is based on such ignorance. Australians are not becoming welfare dependent. As I noted in June, the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey showed that fewer households and individuals are dependent on welfare now than 10 years ago: Similarly, as the most recent data from the Department of Social Services shows, the percentage of Australians on any form of welfare has also fallen over the past decade: And finally, as ANU\u2019s Peter Whiteford has noted, based on the Hilda survey, 65% of all households received some form of welfare between 2001 and 2011, but only 11.4% of households received welfare in each of those years. And a mere 3% of households received over half of their total income during that period from welfare. In short: Australians are becoming less welfare dependent, and people on welfare do not get trapped. People go on welfare, and then overwhelmingly get off it. These opening lines reveal Forrest\u2019s philosophical view on welfare, and it flows through into his suggestion that people should have their income managed through use of a \u201chealth welfare card\u201d. This card would limit the things on which people could spend their money. But it wouldn\u2019t just limit it to food, rent and utilities. Forrest also recommends the card prevent spending on things like alcohol and gambling and also any \u201cactivities discouraged by government\u201d such as \u201cpornography\u201d. It\u2019s an oddly paternalistic policy to advocate, given Forrest writes in the report how it is \u201ctime to end the paternalism\u201d. But aside from the fact such a policy treats those on welfare as less able than those employed, does income management work? Luckily for us, the Parliamentary Library last year provided a research note addressing this basic point. It found that there were lots of anecdotes either way, but scant evidence to suggest changes in behaviour. It concluded that there is \u201clittle evidence to date that income management is resulting in widespread behaviour change, either with respect to building an ability to effectively manage money or in building \u2018socially responsible behaviour\u2019 beyond the direct impact of limiting the amount that can be spent on some items\u201d. Forrest, however, asserts in his report that income management will save the government money \u201cbecause individuals will move to employment more quickly as they are able to concentrate on their return to work\u201d. Just don\u2019t bother looking for any evidence to support this claim. So it\u2019s not so much about achieving any aim as making sure people on welfare are not seen to waste the money. Unless you\u2019re spending money on things Forrest and the government thinks are worthwhile, you\u2019re not getting, to quote the report, \u201cthe full benefit from the welfare provided by government\u201d. Except, of course, Forrest does not suggest it should apply to all people on welfare: he specifically excludes \u201caged pensioners and veterans\u201d. I suppose those pensioners across the country sitting in RSLs playing the pokies are just investing wisely for their future. The view that welfare should only be spent on certain things comes from the belief that welfare is essentially a waste to the economy, and that is it mostly wasted by those who receive it. It is a view much promulgated by some in the US and, sadly, adopted by many in conservative media and politics here. It is the driver behind \u201cwork for the dole\u201d schemes, which also have little evidence to support their achieving any of their stated aims. But even such income management won\u2019t stop criticism of welfare as \u201ca trap\u201d or a waste; it just helps the critics of welfare shrink the welfare pie even more. For example, the US \u201cfood stamps\u201d program limits the things that can be bought, but it still attracts the same criticism from the same type of people who think welfare is a blight. Instead of criticising people on welfare for not spending money on food, they just criticise what type of food is bought. Fox news has recently made great noise complaining that people on food stamps are able to buy seafood or organically grown food. Conservative politicians such as Paul Ryan suggested such programs turned the welfare safety net into \u201ca hammock that lulls able-bodied people to lives of dependency and complacency\u201d or even, a \u201cpoverty trap\u201d. And the Republican party last year voted to cut funding for food stamps by $40bn over the next 10 years. The critics of welfare will continue to criticise people on welfare and suggest welfare needs to be cut. Income management may offer help for people who volunteer to go on it, but suggesting that it applies to all conveys the sense that people on welfare are to blame for their position \u2013 that they clearly lack the smarts or drive to get a job, even if they are disabled, and should be punished for not getting off welfare quickly enough. But if we\u2019re going to institute income management, first we should also institute some fact management for commentary about welfare. With luck, it might reduce the number of statements made by able-minded people who have been lulled into dependence on stereotype and fact-free views about welfare in Australia.",
