      "bodyText": "British Airways has apologised to a Canadian family after they were bitten by bed bugs on a transatlantic flight between Vancouver and London. Heather Szilagyi, her seven-year-old daughter, Molly, and her fiance, Eric Neilson, were left covered with painful insect bites while travelling from Canada to Slovakia this month. British Airways offered an apology to the family and upgraded their return flights to business class. Szilagyi said she had first noticed the bed bugs on the seat in front of her, then spotted another crawling out from behind a TV monitor. \u201cI wanted to grab it but they\u2019re quick and it crawled back inside, behind the screen,\u201d she told the Canadian broadcaster CTV. Szilagyi says she alerted a flight attendant but was told the flight was full and nothing could be done. \u201cIt was nine hours of knowing that I was probably going to get bit, but not being sure,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there wasn\u2019t really anything I could do about it. I was surprised I was able to relax \u2013 but what can you do? Me and my daughter are both really sensitive to insect bites, so she was just covered all over. I\u2019ve still got a really infected one. \u201cWe were not asking for a refund. All we were asking for was a flight on a different plane, to make sure it was a different plane, to make sure that the plane that was infested with bed bugs was taken care of.\u201d A BA spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been in touch with our customer to apologise and investigate further. British Airways operates more than 280,000 flights every year and reports of bed bugs onboard are extremely rare. Nevertheless, we are vigilant and continually monitor our aircraft.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The acquisition of HBOS was a \u201cunique opportunity\u201d for Lloyds Banking Group and regarded by its directors as in shareholders\u2019 best interests, the high court has been told. Helen Davies, QC for Lloyds, opened the bank\u2019s defence on Thursday by telling the court that a \u00a3600m claim for compensation by disgruntled investors was based on \u201cmyths and misconceptions\u201d and that the deal was undertaken after advice from a list of advisers which ran to 50 pages. The Lloyds shareholders claim, among other things, that they were not given a true picture of the financial health of HBOS when they voted through the deal in November 2008 and did not know it was a \u201cbust bank\u201d supported by loans from the Bank of England and from Lloyds itself. Around 6,000 shareholders are making their claim against Lloyds and five of its former directors \u2013 including the former chairman Sir Victor Blank and ex-chief executive Eric Daniels who are scheduled to give evidence during the 14-week case. Davies told Mr Justice Norris that Daniels owned 300,000 shares in Lloyds and that the decision to proceed with the HBOS takeover, which was announced days after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, was a collective board decision. Davies said that the compensation case was \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d and \u201clegally unprecedented\u201d. The deal represented a \u201cunique opportunity\u201d because before September 2008 it would have run into problems with the competition authorities, said Davies. The court has previously heard that Blank met the then-prime minister, Gordon Brown, days before the deal was announced to be reassured that competition concerns could be overcome if the deal was done. Davies said that over the weekend of 12 October 2008 \u2013 when the government was working on a bailout of the entire UK banking system \u2013 the board had to make an \u201curgent decision\u201d about whether to proceed with the deal. The offer price was reduced, while the original offer of \u00a312.2bn had a \u201csignificant buffer\u201d built in given that the \u201cbook value\u201d of HBOS was \u00a325bn at the time. As well as Blank and Daniels, the former finance director Tim Tookey, former head of retail Helen Weir and former head of wholesale banking Truett Tate are named in the case and are scheduled to give evidence. Before Davies began, Richard Hill QC, for the shareholders, had said that Merrill Lynch, advisers to Lloyds during the deal, garnered fees of \u00a311m for working on the takeover deal. Hill said that in December 2008 \u2013 after HBOS issued a profits warning to the City \u2013 the Lloyds board had taken advice about pulling out. The case continues.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s Joshua Mahony of IG to sum up th day: Early losses have been partially erased throughout European equities today, after a sharp Catalonia driven selloff was largely pushed aside, with traders seeing the government\u2019s decision to invoke article 155 as a positive for economic and political stability. While the potential for further Catalan protest means a degree of uncertainty remains, today\u2019s actions have allayed much of the market fears, driving the euro higher throughout the day. UK consumers continue to experience a tough time of it recently, with pressure from all sides reducing the amount of disposable income available for households. Today\u2019s fall in retail sales comes as no surprise given this week\u2019s inflation data, with CPI rising to 3.0%, paving the way for a continued deterioration in real incomes as the year progresses. With wages failing to keep up with inflation, and many mortgages due to rise in the event of a November rate rise, the continued deterioration in retail sales is a product of an economic squeeze on UK consumers, at a time when confidence remains depleted. That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The Catalonian independence struggle has taken another twist today, with the Madrid indicating it will trigger article 155 of Spain\u2019s constitution, a move that would suspend the region\u2019s autonomy. Here\u2019s our latest report on a saga that is causing tensions in the financial markets. European markets have closed for the night, with small losses across the board. The FTSE 100 lost 0.3%, amid worries over the UK retail slowdown and underwhelming results from Unilever this morning. There were deeper falls on other indices, as Spain\u2019s government moved closer to taking direct control of Catalonia. It was rather worse 30 years ago..... A UK government spokesperson has responded to Blankfein.... I\u2019m disappointed they didn\u2019t defend the coded attack on Britain\u2019s weather.... Here\u2019s our news story about Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s Brexit intervention: America\u2019s jobs market remains in rude health. Just 222,000 US citizens filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, new figures show. That\u2019s the lowest since 1973. It follows a spike as firms were disrupted by the hurricanes that smashed their way through several US states in recent weeks (also causing massive damage in the Caribbean). Over in New York, Wall Street has opened in the red on the 30th anniversary of Black Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average is down almost 100 points, or 0.4% - a small dip, after days of record highs. Apple shares have fallen by 2%, following reports that the tech giant is cutting production of its new iPhone 8. I agree with Laura... Here\u2019s Philip Coggan of the Economist on Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s intervention.... Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s tweet about spending a lot more time in Frankfurt has caused a stir at the EU council meeting in Brussels. Blankfein\u2019s intervention puts more pressure on Theresa May to secure a transition deal, and soon. City firms are expected to activate their contingency plans for a hard Brexit early next year, unless there is progress in the negotiations.... Here\u2019s more reaction to Blankfein may still be sore about the EU referendum result. Back in January 2016, Goldman Sachs donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign. Lloyd Blankfein, the boss of Goldman Sachs, has dropped a very loud hint that he\u2019ll be moving jobs from the UK to Germany thanks to Brexit. Blankfein, one of the most powerful bankers in the world, tweets: Goldman has just leased space in a Frankfurt skyscraper, with room for 800 staff, as it tries to minimise disruption once Britain leaves the EU. After Brexit, City banks will lose passporting rights to sell services across Europe. Goldman said two weeks ago that: \u201cThis expanded office space will allow us to grow our operations in Germany to continue serving our clients, as well as provide us with the space to execute on our Brexit contingency plan as needed.\u201d The City likes a good anniversary - a chance for older hands to impress young guns with tales of market mayhem. And they don\u2019t come much bigger than Black Monday in 1987, when shares crashed around the globe, wiping more than 20% off the Dow Jones. Here\u2019s a classic front page from the big day: But for such a big crash, it\u2019s remarkable how quickly shares bounced back (not like the Great Crash of 1929, and the subsequent Great Depression). The crash may have deterred some people from risking their money in the stock market. But, as this chart shows, you\u2019d have done well if you\u2019d bought shares to years ago (as long as you avoided Japan and Greece...) So, could it happen again? Well....some experts have blamed the crash on \u2018portfolio insurance\u2019. This was designed to protect investors from being wiped out, but in reality it forced them to sell assets to into a falling market, making the slump worse and worse. Matt Maley, who worked at Solomon Brothers (in the days of Liar\u2019s Poker), explained more here. Chris Godding, CIO of investment manager Tilney, argues that the markets work better today, Speaking on Sky News, he cites better controls in the equity markets today, and circuit breakers that would give investors time to evaluate. However, currency markets don\u2019t have such cushions, so they could be the places to look for the next market panic, bedlam or crash... Stock markets are marking the 30th anniversary of Black Monday today, by taking a collective bath into the red. European markets are down almost 1%, and on track for their worst day in seven weeks (which shows how calm things have been recently). In London, the FTSE 100 is still down around 40 points, with Unilever down 4% after missing sales forecasts this morning. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to drop when trading being in New York (at 9.30am local time). Some traders are blaming Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan, who warned today that the markets could suffer a \u201cMinsky moment\u201d. That means a sudden plunge in asset valuations, following a period of stability which encouraged people to speculate and drive prices unsustainably high..... Here\u2019s our news story on the UK retail sales gloom: Britain\u2019s retailers are under the cosh, says Mike Cherry, who chairs the Federation of Small Businesses. He blames the fall in the pound since the EU referendum, and the lack of clarity over Britain\u2019s future. \u201cToday\u2019s figures reflect the perfect storm of challenges facing our small retailers. Rising input costs, flagging consumer demand and chronic delays to business rates relief are all weighing on our high streets. A weak pound may be boosting our exporters but it\u2019s proving to be a real drag on spending power. \u201cThen we have the Brexit element. One in five small employers has EU staff on their books \u2013 until these vital workers have concrete guarantees about their right to remain, retailers will be in a perpetual state of uncertainty. This will hamper their ability create new jobs in future. \u201cConfidence among small retailers has plummeted over the last two quarters. The Chancellor must step in at the Budget. The least he can do is ensure his \u00a3435 million package of rates relief measures is fully in place by 22 November.\u201d Briton\u2019s literally tightened their belts last month, it seems. Today\u2019s retail sales report shows that the amount of food bought in the shops fell by 1.2% in September, compared to a year ago. However, the amount spent on food rose by 1.6%, because inflation has driven up prices. Today\u2019s retail sales figures make a hat-trick of worrying UK economic data this week. On Tuesday, inflation jumped to 3% - its highest level in four and a half-years. More expensive food and fuel was partly to blame. On Wednesday, we learned that earnings are only rising by 2.1%. That means that real wages shrank in the three months to August, despite the jobless rate sticking at a 42-year low. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown says: \u2018September\u2019s retail sales figures show some evidence of belt tightening, with discretionary spending taking a particularly big hit, as shoppers prioritise more essential items as prices rise. This has given the pound a bit of a bloody nose on the currency markets, with investors scaling back their expectations of a rate rise from the Bank of England. The 0.8% drop in UK retail sales in September shows that the surge in inflation since the Brexit vote is hurting So argues PwC\u2019s Andrew Sentance. He points out that retail sales growth has fallen sharply this year, to below its long-term average. Sentance explains: The underlying trend is towards slower retail growth and we are seeing the weakest rate of increase in the volume of spending for over four years and since the summer of 2013. In the past three months, year-on-year sales volumes were up just 1.5%, compared with around 4% annual growth in the three years 2014 to 2016. \u201cThe main reason for this slowdown is inflation. Prices of goods bought in shops, at petrol stations and online in September were 3.3% up on a year ago, whereas only a year ago they were falling by 1%. This surge in inflation - which mainly reflects the fall in sterling since the EU Referendum vote - is squeezing consumers and holding back the growth of retail spending in volume terms.\u201d Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says Theresa May should be worried.... Evidence is growing to suggest that Britain\u2019s shoppers are keeping wallets in pockets against a backdrop of growing uncertainty. \u201cFive-year high inflation combined with slow wage growth has consumers feeling the pinch.... Philip Shaw of Investec agrees that UK households are struggling as the cost of living rises. Howard Archer of EY Item Club says the figures could deter the Bank of England from raising borrowing costs next month: Here\u2019s Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, on the retail sales slowdown: \u201cUncomfortable questions have been raised about just where UK growth is going to emerge from in Q4. Consumption is the engine of the UK economy and the retail sector, which hammered by a weak pound, tighter margins and customers beset by real wage declines are in the eye of the storm at the moment. \u201cWe will find out in the coming months whether this is consumers holding off on purchases in preparation for Christmas, or whether the Bank of England\u2019s messaging on interest rate rises has been enough to keep some hands in pockets. We can but hope that this weakening sales pattern is also bringing about a slowing of the consumer credit expansion; retail sales in the past have been powered by a \u2018buy-now-pay-later\u2019 mentality and we continue to worry about a \u2018buy-now-default-later\u2019 reality.\u201d Given real wages are shrinking, it\u2019s not a surprise that people are buying less stuff in the shops. Alex Marsh, managing director of Close Brothers Retail Finance, suggests that consumer confidence has dipped - although there are other reasons why shoppers cut back: \u201cFollowing the unexpectedly positive uplift in retail sales in August, this month\u2019s figures signal a downturn in consumer confidence as the ONS reports a 0.8% decrease in retail sales last month. September is a notoriously busy month for those returning to full time education and embarking on graduate jobs, leaving limited time for shopping. This \u201cback to normality\u201d month sees consumers returning to a more reserved level of spending as consumers resume their regular routines and holiday expenditure slows. City economists had only expected UK retail sales to dip by 0.1% last month, so today\u2019s 0.8% decline is alarming traders. The big picture in today\u2019s retail sales report is that growth has slowed significantly over the last three months: The pound has fallen by over half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.314. The news that UK shoppers cut back last month has disappointed the City, as it may signal that the economy is slowing. NEWSFLASH: UK retail sales were much weaker than expected last month. The amount bought across the retail industry shrank by 0.8% during September, a sign that consumers reined in their spending. Non-food stores suffered the biggest decline in takings. That means that retail sales volumes over the last year have only risen by 1.2%. The Office for National Statistics also reports that prices in the shops rose by 3.3% over the last year - the biggest jump since March 2012. The figures also show that people spent 0.5% less in the shops in September than in August [this survey tracks the volume of sales, and the value] Kate Davies, ONS Senior Statistician explains: \u201cSeptember\u2019s retail sales saw a monthly decline of 0.8%, reversing August\u2019s growth. However, there is a continuation of the underlying trend of steady growth in sales volumes following a weak start to the year, and a background of generally rising prices. These increased costs are reflected in the more rapid growth in the amount spent when compared with the quantity bought.\u201d Reaction to follow.... The New Zealand dollar has more than 1% since the left-leaning Labour Party won the battle to form the next government. Europe\u2019s stock markets are all falling this morning, failing to take much comfort from China\u2019s growth figures. Unilever\u2019s sales gloom has helped to pull the FTSE 100 down by 41 points. Spain\u2019s market is being pulled down by the Catalonia crisis, with signs that Madrid is about to impose direct rule... The US stock market is also expected to fall, when it opens in five hours time. Back in the City, shares in consumer giant Unilever have fallen by 3.5% after the company disappointed investors today. Unilever CEO Paul Polman blamed \u201cpoorer weather in Europe and natural disasters in the Americas\u201d for a slowdown in underlying sales growth, to 2.6% in the last three months. That\u2019s down from 3% earlier this year, and well below forecasts of 3.9% growth. The company warned: Overall market conditions have remained challenging. In the markets in which we operate volumes were flat in aggregate. We are seeing some early signs of improving conditions in emerging markets. Icecream sales came off the boil, apparently: China\u2019s official growth rate over the last five years is very consistent.... Finnish economist Iikka Korhonen suggests that China\u2019s growth rate is suspiciously consistent, despite remarkable volatility in business spending, factory output and retail sales. Trading Economics flag up that spending on new offices, factories and machinery is slowing. Bloomberg\u2019s Haidi Lun\u2019s brought her best GIF game to work today.... Financial experts are often sceptical about China\u2019s growth figures, arguing that they could be manipulated by officials to produce a number to Beijing\u2019s liking. But on face value, today\u2019s Q3 GDP report looks fairly impressive. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the annual growth rate of 6.8% was bang in line with forecasts, and above Beijing\u2019s target of 6.5% growth this year. Property Sales finally showed some signs of slowing in response to the curbs, and while govt spending on infrastructure and some inventory building were key contributors to growth, it is also increasingly obvious that the Services sector (particularly the tech sector) is increasingly becoming a, if not the, primary driver of growth, i.e. signalling that the economy is actually rebalancing. China\u2019s economy has shrugged off fears of a sharp slowdown, by notching up another quarter of solid growth. Chinese GDP rose by an annual rate of 6.8% in July to September, new figures from Beijing show. That\u2019s slightly down on the 6.9% recorded earlier this year, but means China is well on track to beat the official target of growth around 6.5%. This suggests that Beijing\u2019s drive to puncture property speculation and drain its shadow banking sector aren\u2019t derailing the economy. The figures come at a good time, as the Chinese communist party is holding its five-yearly congress. Yesterday, president Xi declared boldly that China was \u201cmoving closer to centre stage\u201d in a new era. He spoke about curbing financial risks, encouraging innovation and increasing consumer spending, as China\u2019s economic rebalancing continues. Xi also hinted that people should stop seeking a quick buck (yen?) in the property market, declaring that: \u201cHouses are for living, not for speculating.\u201d A lesson for us all there..... New figures today also show that China\u2019s fixed-asset investment slowed in September, but retail sales picked up. Industrial output rose by 6.6% per year, up from 6.0%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s plenty of economic data and political drama to get our teeth into today. In the UK, the latest retail sales figures will show whether consumers kept spending last month. Economists predict a 0.1% monthly fall, as people tighten their belts as the cost of living rises. On an annual basis, retail sales growth is expected to drop to 2.1%, from 2.4% in August. Following Tuesday\u2019s jump in inflation, and Wednesday\u2019s unemployment figures, this is another important healthcheck on the UK economy. Consumer spending has been a key driver of UK growth recently, so any pull back could be a concern. RBC Capital Markets say the figures could help determine whether the Bank of England raises interest rates next month: After a strong August in both value and volume terms, led by non-food stores, the market is looking for somewhat of a pull-back this time in expecting a month-on-month decline in volumes. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also expects a small decline in spending: With Christmas coming it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise if we were to see a pause in the September numbers. Expectations are for a slowdown from August\u2019s 1% rise to no change or a slightly negative reading of -0.1, as Q3 comes to an end. There\u2019s lots of political drama around the globe today. New Zealand has a new prime minister, Labour\u2019s Jacinda Ardern, ending several weeks of uncertainty: It\u2019s deadline day for Catalonia\u2019s leader Carles Puigdemont to decide whether to withdraw his declaration of independence. Madrid could impose direct rule if Puigdemont doesn\u2019t back down. European leaders are heading to Brussels tonight for a summit where Theresa May hopes to unlock the deadlock in the Brexit negotations. However, there\u2019s little sign that the EU will decide that enough progress has been made over the UK\u2019s divorce bill.... The news bucket is overflowing with corporate news too; consumer goods group Unilever, pest control firm Rentokil, and the London Stock Exchange are all reporting results. The LSE has also announced that CEO Xavier Rolet is stepping down at the end of next year.

      "bodyText": "At 5.45am on Thursday, three generations of the Grant family piled in to a Holden Commodore and pulled out of their driveway in the western Melbourne suburb of Sunbury and turned toward Adelaide. It was the second time in six days they had made the 700km trip. The first, on Saturday, was a two-car convoy: Daniel Grant and his 16-year-old son, Jacob, in the 2006 red VZ SS Commodore and Grant\u2019s father, Ross, in his new white SS Commodore. That trip was a celebration, a gathering of 25,000 people in 1,200 vehicles \u2013 all Holdens \u2013 making a slow lap around Adelaide\u2019s northern suburbs, past the Holden manufacturing plant at Elizabeth, where a photographer waited to capture each car as it sat beneath the lion-and-stone emblem. \u201cThis next trip\u2019s more like going to a funeral,\u201d Grant told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhen they said years ago that they were going to [close the plant] I said I\u2019ve got to be there on the day they build their last car. To pay my respects, I suppose.\u201d The last Holden to be fully manufactured in Australia, a red VFII SSV Redline Commodore sedan, will roll off the production line at Elizabeth on Friday morning. It has been wending its way through the factory all week under the supervision of the remaining 950 production workers, who are also completing farewell models of the Caprice V, a luxury sedan used as a police car in the United States, as well as a V6 Commodore Calais wagon and an SS Commodore ute. But it\u2019s the SSV that tugs at the heartstrings of Holden fans, who are legion. More than 2,000 of them, including the Grants, plan to park outside the factory before workers arrive at 6am to greet the last shift. Many have travelled from interstate. This is not an ordinary factory closure. It is the end of an era for both Holden and for car manufacturing in Australia. Toyota rolled its last car off the line in Geelong on 3 October and Ford closed its manufacturing plants at Geelong and Broadmeadows in October last year. Mitsubishi, often the forgotten cousin of Australian mass car manufacturing, closed its plant in Adelaide\u2019s southern suburbs in 2008. For the first time since 1948, when the first mass-produced Holdens, the 48-215, were produced at Fisherman\u2019s Bend in Melbourne, Australia will no longer build its own cars. The engineering and development divisions will remain. Paul Bastian, national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, pinpoints the closure of the Holden and Toyota manufacturing facilities to 2.08pm on 10 December, 2013, when then treasurer Joe Hockey stepped up to the despatch box in Parliament House and demanded Holden \u201ccome clean with the Australian people about their intentions\u201d. \u201cWe want them to be honest about it \u2014 we want them to be fair dinkum\u2014because, if I was running a business and I was committed to that business in Australia, I would not be saying that I have not made any decision about Australia,\u201d Hockey said. \u201cEither you are here or you are not.\u201d The federal government had been in lengthy discussions with Holden\u2019s parent company, General Motors, for several months about the company\u2019s request for $150m a year in government assistance to offset the cost of production in Australia, which had ballooned as the mining boom drove the Australian dollar to record highs. Without that assistance, GM said, it was not sure it could keep manufacturing in Australia. Holden received $1.8bn in government support between 2001 and 2012, Hockey said. The automotive manufacturing industry as a whole received $30bn in financial assistance between 1997 and 2012, according to a 2014 Productivity Commission report. Hockey\u2019s comments, which were followed by similar remarks from then Nationals leader Warren Truss, splashed across newspaper front pages the next day under headlines saying the treasurer had dared Holden to leave. GM made the decision to pull production before the first editions were printed that night, and Holden managing director Mike Devereux made the formal announcement to staff at the Elizabeth factory the following day. Toyota followed suit on 10 February, 2014. Ford had announced its intention to move offshore in May 2013, two months before the federal election. \u201cIt was clearly a decision of this government to dare the auto sector to leave,\u201d Bastian told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt was a disgraceful performance by a government, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before and I hope I never see anything like it again.\u201d More than 800 people have been retrenched from Holden\u2019s Elizabeth plant in the four years since the closure was announced and the remaining 950 will formally finish up on Friday. The plant has been in operation since 1965. According to Holden\u2019s own figures, 83% of those who have left the company have \u201csuccessfully transitioned\u201d into other opportunities, while 9% are still looking for a job and 6% opted not to take part in the $30m transition program. That\u2019s slightly misleading, Labor\u2019s industry spokesman Kim Carr says, because the program\u2019s measure of success includes retirement or returning to study. It does not mean the majority of ex-Holden employees have found full time employment that matched their annual average salary of $60,000. \u201cA lot of the jobs that people are going to are casualised, itinerant, and pay substantially less,\u201d Carr says. A 2006 study of the impact of the closure of the Mitsubishi manufacturing plant found that of those retrenched in the first wave of redundancies, 25% remained unemployed, 11% were self employed, 31% were in full time work, and 7% had retired. Of those who were employed, only 4% had permanent positions while 35% were casual and 15% were on short-term contracts. The AMWU, which learned from the lessons of the Mitsubishi closure, says the transition programs at Ford, Toyota and Holden were much improved. But the economy is not as robust as it was in 2008, and Carr says that, combined with policy settings that he says do not support the growth of the vehicle component manufacturing industry, could make it more difficult for those who walk out of the factory on Friday to find work. \u201c[The Mitsubishi closure] was in the middle of a mining boom,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe are not in a mining boom now.\u201d The total national job losses as a result of the closure of end-to-end car manufacturing were estimated to be 200,000, according to a 2014 study by the University of Adelaide\u2019s Australian workplace innovation and social research centre. About 6,500 of those were people directly employed at car manufacturing plants. As of August this year, there were 44,212 people working in the vehicle manufacturing sector in Australia, of which 92% worked full time and 85% were men. Most of those jobs are in the vehicle component sector. Carr said Australia needed to invest in those workplaces, which consist of 70 to 80 tier-one suppliers and about 1,000 other smaller companies, to prevent them from also going offshore. Bastian is not optimistic that component manufacturers will remain in Australia. He said some replacement manufacturing jobs will be created by in the $90bn naval shipbuilding program, which will be centred around South Australia, as well as other defence spending in armoured vehicles and F-35 joint strike fighter production. He says that allowing Holden and other manufacturers to leave was short-sighted. \u201cThe reality is we\u2019re an island nation,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think that we can survive off breaking big rocks into small rocks, and agriculture, is a nonsense. For Holden fans, the loss is less economic than psychological. It does not matter to them that Holden will continue to sell a version of the Commodore, which was Australia\u2019s best-selling car from 1996 to 2000 and is a fixture on every suburban Australian street. The car will no longer be built in Australia. The 2018 Commodore model is a German-built Opel Insignia, rebadged as a Holden and sized up to a V6 for the Australian market. \u201cMakes you wonder why they insist on calling it a Commodore,\u201d said one commenter on the motoring.com.au story announcing the new model. \u201cAnyone with any loyalty to that name would know that it isn\u2019t one.\u201d It\u2019s that loyalty that makes the loss of Holden hit harder than earlier closures like that of Mitsubishi, which had the same devastating impact on an isolated Adelaide job market. There is a deep affection in Australia for generations of Holden vehicles. It is difficult to imagine the same level of affection for a Mitsubishi Magna, the Japanese company\u2019s Commodore equivalent. \u201cThe Magna wasn\u2019t really a huge car that people loved,\u201d south Adelaide man Raymond Ross said. Ross has two Holdens: a 1977 HQ SS, the first SS model manufactured in Australia, and a 2017 SS Commodore. \u201cWhen I realised the factory was shutting up and there weren\u2019t going to be anymore and I was in line to get a new car, I thought: How cool to have one of the last SSs released \u2026 I sort of see it as a set of bookends; the first and the last.\u201d The Grants planned their arrival in Adelaide on Thursday afternoon to leave enough time to wash the VZ so it is presentable at the factory the next morning. Grant says the car, along with a 1973 LJ Torana which had previously been owned by his father, were \u201cpart of the family.\u201d The Torana carried himself, his younger brother, and later his four children on their first trip home from hospital. It was the bridal car in his wedding. \u201cHoldens in my family go way beyond just a form of transport, they are part of the family, memories are made with them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of pride; pride that we don\u2019t have to rely on the world to make good stuff. It\u2019s good quality. We made good cars here.\u201d",

But the economy is not as robust as it was in 2008, and Carr says that, combined with policy settings that he says do not support the growth of the vehicle component manufacturing industry, could make it more difficult for those who walk out of the factory on Friday to find work.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The Mitsubishi closure] was in the middle of a mining boom,\u201d Carr said. \u201cWe are not in a mining boom now.\u201d</p> \n<p>The total national job losses as a result of the closure of end-to-end car manufacturing were estimated to be 200,000, according to a 2014 study by the University of Adelaide\u2019s Australian workplace innovation and social research centre.</p> \n<p>About 6,500 of those were people directly employed at car manufacturing plants.</p> \n<p>As of August this year, there were 44,212 people working in the vehicle manufacturing sector in Australia, of which 92% worked full time and 85% were men. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-18T02:26:08/embed.html\" data-alt=\"jobs graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2017-10-18T02:26:08/embed.html\">jobs graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Most of those jobs are in the vehicle component sector. Carr said Australia needed to invest in those workplaces, which consist of 70 to 80 tier-one suppliers and about 1,000 other smaller companies, to prevent them from also going offshore.</p> \n<p>Bastian is not optimistic that component manufacturers will remain in Australia. He said some replacement manufacturing jobs will be created by in the $90bn naval shipbuilding program, which will be centred around South Australia, as well as other defence spending in armoured vehicles and F-35 joint strike fighter production.</p> \n<p>He says that allowing Holden and other manufacturers to leave was short-sighted. </p> \n<p>\u201cThe reality is we\u2019re an island nation,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think that we can survive off breaking big rocks into small rocks, and agriculture, is a nonsense.</p> \n<p>For Holden fans, the loss is less economic than psychological. It does not matter to them that Holden will continue to sell a version of the Commodore, which was Australia\u2019s best-selling car from 1996 to 2000 and is a fixture on every suburban Australian street. The car will no longer be built in Australia. The 2018 Commodore model is a German-built Opel Insignia, rebadged as a Holden and sized up to a V6 for the Australian market.</p> \n<p>\u201cMakes you wonder why they insist on calling it a Commodore,\u201d said one commenter on <a href=\"https://www.motoring.com.au/2018-holden-commodore-production-begins-106822/\">the motoring.com.au story announcing the new model</a>. \u201cAnyone with any loyalty to that name would know that it isn\u2019t one.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s that loyalty that makes the loss of Holden hit harder than earlier closures like that of Mitsubishi, which had the same devastating impact on an isolated Adelaide job market. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67cfb63943861f579a5dbdb5b8854af2277ae3b9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67cfb63943861f579a5dbdb5b8854af2277ae3b9/0_161_4044_2426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"red holden station wagon at manufacturing plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The final Holden cars will roll off the factory line on 20 October.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HOLDEN/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is a deep affection in Australia for generations of Holden vehicles.

    "webTitle": "Aslef asks members to bring Southern rail dispute to an end", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Drivers on Southern rail could be about to end their dispute after their union recommended a deal that would allow some trains to run without guards and give drivers a 28.5% pay rise over the next five years. Industrial action has been disrupting the railway since April 2016 but now Aslef, the drivers\u2019 union, will ask its members to vote to end the row. Talks between Aslef and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), the parent company of Southern, have continued on and off for much of this year, but on two previous occasions drivers have voted against proposed settlements. Strikes were initially brought by the RMT, which represents conductors on Southern, in response to changes to their roles and responsibilities which would allow trains to run without them in driver-only operations. Aslef supported their action, and called a series of strikes that brought Southern to a standstill in December and January. While the RMT remains in dispute and has continued to strike, walkouts by guards have caused relatively minimal disruption on Southern in 2017. The Aslef general secretary, Mick Whelan, said: \u201cThe proposed agreement on driver-only operation means we will have a second safety-trained person on every train covered by this agreement, except in exceptional circumstances. That person will have all the relevant safety competence including the skills to evacuate passengers in an emergency.\u201d He said the deal would confirm and underpin employment terms and conditions. He said the proposed agreement was fully backed by Aslef\u2019s executive as a \u201ccomplete resolution of our long-standing issues with Southern\u201d. But he said it was \u201ccompany-specific and does not have implications for any other company on the railway network\u201d. The RMT\u2019s disputes over driver-only operation have now spread to four other franchises, although Aslef is yet to join them \u2013 straining relations between two unions that briefly stood side by side last year. Ballot papers on the new deal will go to drivers next week with the result due on 8 November. Nick Brown, the chief operating officer of GTR, said: \u201cWe welcome the Aslef executive\u2019s endorsement of the proposals we have negotiated to resolve the dispute. We have concluded negotiations on pay, productivity and driver-only operation in a package that will now be put to a referendum of Aslef members.\u201d The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said the union would continue to oppose driver-only operation. He said: \u201cFrom what we have seen so far this is exactly the sort of deal that Southern and Chris Grayling have been hoping for and which drivers and guards have been fighting against\u200e. This is just a rehash of earlier company and government proposals that have been roundly rejected as unsafe. \u201cIt is shocking that Southern and the government believe that drivers can be bought off in this fashion. You cannot put a price on the safety and welfare of passengers and drivers.\u201d",

While the RMT remains in dispute and has continued to strike, walkouts by guards have caused relatively minimal disruption on Southern in 2017.</p> <p>The Aslef general secretary, Mick Whelan, said: \u201cThe proposed agreement on driver-only operation means we will have a second safety-trained person on every train covered by this agreement, except in exceptional circumstances. That person will have all the relevant safety competence including the skills to evacuate passengers in an emergency.\u201d </p> <p>He said the deal would confirm and underpin employment terms and conditions. He said the proposed agreement was fully backed by Aslef\u2019s executive as a \u201ccomplete resolution of our long-standing issues with Southern\u201d. But he said it was \u201ccompany-specific and does not have implications for any other company on the railway network\u201d. </p> <p>The RMT\u2019s disputes over driver-only operation have now spread to four other franchises, although Aslef is yet to join them \u2013 straining relations between two unions that briefly stood side by side last year.</p> <p>Ballot papers on the new deal will go to drivers next week with the result due on 8 November. </p> <p>Nick Brown, the chief operating officer of GTR, said: \u201cWe welcome the Aslef executive\u2019s endorsement of the proposals we have negotiated to resolve the dispute. We have concluded negotiations on pay, productivity and driver-only operation in a package that will now be put to a referendum of Aslef members.\u201d</p> <p>The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said the union would continue to oppose driver-only operation. He said: \u201cFrom what we have seen so far this is exactly the sort of deal that Southern and Chris Grayling have been hoping for and which drivers and guards have been fighting against\u200e. This is just a rehash of earlier company and government proposals that have been roundly rejected as unsafe.</p> <p>\u201cIt is shocking that Southern and the government believe that drivers can be bought off in this fashion. You cannot put a price on the safety and welfare of passengers and drivers.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s nice to know there\u2019ll be a knees-up, but it would be more useful to hear why Rolet has chosen to go. Neither the company nor the man himself bothered to explain. We\u2019re just supposed to assume that, with a decade or so on the clock, nothing could be more natural than quitting at the age of only 57. But, if a decade-and-out is somehow an unwritten rule for FTSE bosses, nobody has told Simon Wolfson (16 years at Next), Willie Walsh (12 at British Airways and parent IAG), let alone Sir Martin Sorrell (31 at WPP). One assumes Rolet has something up his sleeve since he was prepared to go to make way for his counterpart if the merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse had happened (a move into French politics was a rumour). But he\u2019ll be a loss for the LSE. As chairman Donald Brydon says, the record is impressive. The share price has improved from 500p to \u00a339 and Rolet\u2019s expansionary ambition has paid off in spades. A decade ago, the LSE was concentrated in equities and being perpetually sized up for takeover. These days it is a \u00a314bn company also running indices, clearing over-the-counter derivatives and in control of operations that extend well beyond London and Europe. Almost nobody mourns the collapse of the Deutsche deal. The LSE\u2019s share price has improved by almost 30% since March, shouting confidence in the group\u2019s ability to withstand whatever Brexit brings. On the Brexit front, Rolet\u2019s extended goodbye thankfully allows time for him to continue as the City\u2019s most effective speaker on two critical points. First, that a transitional deal is desperately needed \u2013 and soon. Second, that the EU would be silly to attempt to dismantle London\u2019s dominance in clearing euro-denominated trades: the disruption would create unnecessary financial risks for everybody. The latter argument sounds so much better from a Frenchman \u2013 Rolet should keep banging the drum. The BP chairman is great? Try telling investors Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, is being generous to his outgoing chairman when he says the company\u2019s comeback after the Deepwater Horizon disaster \u201cwould not have been possible without the strong leadership and steadfast support of Carl-Henric and the board\u201d. Carl-Henric Svanberg was chiefly notable during the 2010 crisis for being invisible. Strong leadership, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 at least not in the eyes of the outside world, which was the constituency that mattered. Dudley\u2019s predecessor, Tony Hayward, became the sole public face of BP and, plainly stressed, made his own position impossible with his crass comment about wanting \u201cmy life back\u201d \u2013 11 people had died in the explosion. Shareholders were openly critical of Svanberg\u2019s low profile. Yes, it\u2019s true that BP has \u201ccome back\u201d in the sense that it was able to pay the enormous clean-up bill and fines. But the other thing that came roaring back was executives\u2019 enormous pay packets, to the point where 60% of shareholders in 2016 voted against Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m pay package in a year in which BP reported record losses, cut thousands of jobs and froze employees\u2019 pay. At an establishment company such as BP, it takes some doing to stir 60% of normally supine investors to scream \u201ctoo greedy\u201d. But, on Svanberg\u2019s watch, it happened. Maybe he\u2019s brilliant behind the scenes but next May\u2019s annual meeting, the actual moment of his retirement, probably won\u2019t be a shareholder love-in. Unilever\u2019s vision is to boost profit margins It\u2019s a good thing that Unilever isn\u2019t in the short-termist game of managing its business for quarterly results. The last quarter was a shocker. Or, rather, the sales figure was so shocking to the City that the share price fell 5.5%. Could that prompt Kraft Heinz to return with another bid? If some in the City are still dreaming about a repeat of February\u2019s drama, they are surely destined to be disappointed. Unilever\u2019s share price has still risen from \u00a333 to \u00a343 since the approach from US cheese-and-ketchup merchant, which is a useful deterrent against opportunistic debt-fuelled bidders. More to the point, one bad number \u2013 underlying quarterly sales growth of 2.6% instead of the 3.9% predicted by the City \u2013 really doesn\u2019t mean much. Amid the whirl of post-Kraft activity, only one target really counts. Can Unilever get profit margins to 20% by 2020? The company remains confident, as it would be, but the earliest and sensible guess can be made by outsiders is 2019. By that time, Kraft\u2019s gaze will have turned elsewhere \u2013 and may have done so already. In the meantime, the interesting short-term news will be the outcome of Unilever\u2019s review of its dual-headed corporate structure, which is due by Christmas, just in time for the next Brexit showdown.

      "bodyText": "Unilever has had a disappointing summer after ice-cream sales were hit by competition from a new low-calorie brand, poor weather in Europe and hurricanes in the Americas. The consumer goods group, the biggest ice-cream maker in the world and the producer of Magnum, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s and Wall\u2019s, reported double-digit sales declines in Europe between July and September. The company blamed bad weather against a strong quarter last year. In the US, the Anglo-Dutch company has been losing ground to Halo Top, a new \u201chealthy ice-cream\u201d brand that bills itself as \u201clow-calorie, high-protein and low-sugar\u201d. Its tubs display the number of calories per pint prominently. In response, Unilever launched seven low-calorie, high-protein ice cream variants under the name Breyers delights in North America in July. Unilever, whose other brands include Dove and Marmite, said overall underlying sales rose 2.6% in the third quarter, less than the 3.9% growth analysts expected and the 3% rise in the first half of the year. The company\u2019s shares fell more than 5% on Thursday; they had risen by about a third since Kraft\u2019s unsuccessful $143bn (\u00a3110bn) takeover bid in February. Unilever\u2019s finance chief, Graeme Pitkethly, admitted that \u201ccompetitiveness has dropped off a little\u201d. There are concerns that reduced spending on marketing is hurting sales after Unilever raised its profitability target in July. Big consumer groups have come under pressure from smaller health food brands, which are popular with millennials. Big brands still dominate, accounting for 80% of food sales, but smaller brands have gained market share in 62% of the top 50 packaged food categories, according to a recent study from Cond\u00e9 Nast and Goldman Sachs. It said advertising and distributing products had become much easier. Independent health brands such as Kind, Clif, Kashi and Quest energy bars, Bear Naked cereal and snacks, Siggi\u2019s Icelandic-style yogurt and the organic vegetarian food range Amy\u2019s Kitchen have proliferated, with entrepreneurs tapping into changing consumer tastes toward fresh, healthy and local food. Unilever is trying to fight back with a series of acquisitions. In recent months it has snapped up Pukka Herbs tea in the UK, M\u00e3e Terra organic food in Brazil, the family-owned ice-cream maker Weis in Australia and the fast-growing skincare brand Carver in South Korea. Charlie Huggins, a fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown Select, which holds Unilever shares, said: \u201cLife is becoming more difficult for the consumer goods giants, as competition from smaller, nimbler players intensifies and consumer preferences shift towards niche and alternative brands. \u201cUnilever has responded by cutting costs and raising prices \u2013 however, these are short-term fixes. To succeed in the long term, Unilever will need to adapt its business model, becoming more agile and responsive to changing trends.\u201d Aside from price rises, big food makers have also angered consumers by shrinking products while keeping prices the same, in a move nicknamed shrinkflation. Russ Mould, an investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u201cUnilever sought to compensate for negligible volume growth by squeezing prices higher. \u201cHowever, prices rose at the slowest rate for seven quarters as perhaps even Unilever found that loyal customers can only afford so much and are becoming ever-more price sensitive \u2013 a trend to which Reckitt Benckiser hinted when it flagged increased competition, especially in areas such as home care and laundry.\u201d Reckitt Benckiser, the Slough-based maker of Dettol, Durex and Nurofen, issued its second sales warning of the year this week. Like-for-like revenues will be flat in 2017, the first time this has happened since the company was launched in its current form after a 1999 merger. It is restructuring after the $18bn purchase of Mead Johnson\u2019s baby milk unit. Nestl\u00e9, the world\u2019s biggest packaged food and drinks company, is also under pressure. It said on Thursday that sales growth would weaken to 2.6% this year from a historical low of 3.2% in 2016. The Swiss company, whose brands include Nescaf\u00e9, KitKat and Perrier, is stepping up a restructuring programme and measures to increase profitability. It is selling its US confectionery business and last month took a 68% stake in the hipster California-based Blue Bottle coffee chain \u2013 one of a series of deals designed to counter a shift in consumer sentiment against big brands.",

The company blamed bad weather against a strong quarter last year. </p> <p>In the US, the Anglo-Dutch company has been losing ground to Halo Top, a new \u201chealthy ice-cream\u201d brand that bills itself as \u201clow-calorie, high-protein and low-sugar\u201d. Its tubs display the number of calories per pint prominently. In response, Unilever launched seven low-calorie, high-protein ice cream variants under the name Breyers delights in North America in July.</p> <p>Unilever, whose other brands include Dove and Marmite, said overall underlying sales rose 2.6% in the third quarter, less than the 3.9% growth analysts expected and the 3% rise in the first half of the year. The company\u2019s shares fell more than 5% on Thursday; they had risen by about a third since Kraft\u2019s unsuccessful $143bn (\u00a3110bn) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/19/kraft-heinz-unilever-shareholders-lobbies-uk-government-takeoverbid\">takeover bid in February</a>.</p> <p>Unilever\u2019s finance chief, Graeme Pitkethly, admitted that \u201ccompetitiveness has dropped off a little\u201d.

Energy suppliers were put on notice that they face a range of radical reforms, including a potential rule change that would automatically switch customers to better deals without them taking action. \u201cChange is coming whether the industry likes it or not,\u201d Dermot Nolan, the chief executive of Ofgem, told energy firms in an impassioned speech, the tone of which sometimes bordered on anger. Nolan told industry representatives there was no point challenging price caps or the other reforms he was talking about. \u201cTo those who say they feel can\u2019t do this in a world of more price regulation, I would say think again. These kinds of reforms are overdue. I don\u2019t think the regulator or parliament will take no for an answer. So you might as well as embrace it, because change is coming.\u201d Price caps for millions of households were just one of the big changes ahead, Nolan said, as he revealed Ofgem was considering a shakeup of rules that would allow new entrants into the market and even enable a customer to have more than one supplier. \u201cOne way to proceed is protecting consumers through a process of collective switching,\u201d said Nolan, of a proposal to automatically shift thousands of people at a time off poor-value tariffs. \u201cRather than customers having to make an active choice as with conventional collective switches, the switch could be made on their behalf without them having to do anything. It\u2019s a bit like allowing better deals to find customers, rather than customers having to find the better deals themselves.\u201d Ofgem is at the very early stages of exploring the idea, which it admits would require primary legislation and buy-in from consumers. A spokesperson for one energy supplier said they were bemused by the suggestion, and that there was a risk customers would be upset at being switched to a company they had never heard of. The regulator\u2019s address to an industry conference on Thursday comes in addition to the prime minister\u2019s price cap, which is seen as the biggest intervention in the market since privatisation. Nolan said Ofgem thought \u201cradical\u201d changes might be needed, and that the regulator had been considering whether the model of having energy suppliers at the heart of the market was \u201cstill fit for purpose\u201d. He said one of the most exciting emerging areas was peer-to-peer energy trading, where a householder could buy energy directly from a local power plant or electric car company. Such technology could allow customers to bypass traditional energy suppliers and even make them obsolete, he suggested. \u201cWill these changes make suppliers\u2019 role as middlemen less relevant and potentially even redundant?\u201d he asked. He also fired a shot across the bows of companies which have suggested they might not cooperate with Ofgem over a price cap for a million vulnerable customers because of May\u2019s plans for a much wider cap. Failure to work with Ofgem on the plans would be \u201cspectacularly ill-advised\u201d, he said. The big-six company E.ON would not be drawn on whether it would mount a legal challenge to the wider cap. Michael Lewis, its chief executive, said he would not answer such a hypothetical question. The British Gas owner, Centrica, also repeatedly refused to tell MPs on Tuesday whether it would rule out a challenge in the courts. Lewis said there was a real possibility that a wide cap would damage competition and reduce switching so much that it could become permanent. \u201cIf prices converge, there is a real danger the cap will need to be maintained in place.\u201d The cap would last for a maximum of five years under draft legislation published last week. One of the smaller suppliers said that if the cap was set too low, big energy companies may shift jobs overseas. \u201cWhen you start looking at the unintended consequences, we may suddenly find 20,000 jobs go offshore [to maintain margins and cut costs],\u201d said David Bird, the chief executive of Co-Operative Energy. The company\u2019s plans to create more community-owned green energy generation could be put at risk too, he said. \u201cIf we make no money in the supply business we won\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d Citizen\u2019s Advice said that it received more calls about energy companies that any other industry apart from secondhand cars firms and builders. The group said it expected a wider cap would not take effect for at least 15 to 18 months.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs piled pressure on Theresa May in advance of a crunch European summit by ridiculing London\u2019s hopes of staunching the flow of lucrative banking jobs after Brexit. In a teasing tweet that captured growing business anxiety over the direction of talks, the US bank\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, wrote on Thursday that he expected to be \u201cspending a lot more time\u201d in Frankfurt from now on. Blankfein\u2019s comment suggested that with no clarity on a Brexit deal, the US investment bank is ready to make its contingency plans a reality. The timing of the intervention coincided with the European council summit in Brussels, where leaders of other EU countries are expected to rebuff May\u2019s appeal for trade talks. Goldman has hitherto run much of its European business from headquarters in London, like most investment banks, but has been increasingly vocal about the need to move operations to the EU if Britain leaves the single market without a replacement trade deal in place. Two weeks ago it revealed it was leasing eight floors in a new Frankfurt tower block that could soon hold up to 1,000 staff. It currently employs 6,000 people in the UK, where it has been expanding offices on Fleet Street, versus just 200 in the German financial centre. Responding to the tweet, a Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on an individual statement. But let\u2019s be clear, London is and will remain the world\u2019s leading financial centre. \u201cWe have the breadth of talent, legal system, regulation and deep pools of capital that are simply unrivalled by centres anywhere else in Europe and we are confident of securing an ambitious economic partnership with the EU that will include financial services.\u201d Tarnished by the banking crash, the face of Wall Street\u2019s most controversial investment bank may still have limited political influence among voters, but Blankfein\u2019s intervention comes amid growing signs of business drying up across Britain. A report due out on Monday from the Engineering Employers\u2019 Federation (EEF) is expected to show that half of manufacturers are putting investment on hold as politicians increasingly talk of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit. The annual EEF survey found a third of companies said that they were committed to current plans but awaiting a Brexit deal before investing further, with a further 13% revealing they were now holding off on all investment. More dire business warnings are expected on Friday from other employers\u2019 groups in Britain if the EU summit fails to generate any good news on the direction of Brexit talks. But it is the sight of leading international business figures now openly mocking Britain\u2019s position that could cause most short-term anxiety, especially given their role in steering broader investment sentiment. This month Sam Woods, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, warned that City firms would activate their Brexit contingency plans if there was no deal on a transition period by Christmas. Major banks including JP Morgan, Standard Chartered and Bank of America are among those to announce plans to expand operations in other European cities to deal with the aftermath of Brexit. Frankfurt is one of the frontrunners among a host of European cities hoping to attract banking and financial services jobs away from London after Brexit, as firms seek guaranteed access to the single market. Dublin, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam and Luxembourg are also vying for City jobs.",

      "bodyText": "The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called for an inquiry into London\u2019s role in global money laundering, amid concern about UK banks\u2019 exposure to a corruption investigation into ties between South Africa\u2019s wealthy Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma. Speaking after it emerged that the FBI is to examine any links between US companies and individuals to the Gupta affair (\u00a3), McDonnell said London had become \u201cnotorious\u201d as a centre for money-laundering. The warning comes after the Guardian revealed that the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has asked UK authorities to look into whether HSBC and Standard Chartered were involved in transactions related to the Guptas. Standard Chartered said on Thursday it had closed bank accounts in 2014 due to concerns about potential links to the scandal. HSBC has yet to comment. The potential involvement of UK banks was first raised by former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain, who grew up in South Africa and was a prominent anti-apartheid activist. Lord Hain called on the chancellor last month to ask UK authorities to examine transactions involving 27 people and 14 companies, including Zuma and Gupta family members. He followed up his concerns on Thursday by asking in the House of Lords for an update on the government\u2019s progress in investigating bank accounts \u201csuspected to have been set up for the purposes of transnationally laundering an estimated \u00a3400m [...] of their illicit proceeds\u201d. Hain said UK banks \u201cmust have been conduits for the corrupt proceeds of money stolen from [South African] taxpayers and laundered through Dubai and Hong Kong\u201d. Speaking after Hain\u2019s question, Lord Davies warned the government it must act fast to ensure the UK\u2019s reputation as a financial centre is not affected. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that a number of British banks have got clear and significant interests in South Africa,\u201d Lord Davies said. \u201cIt\u2019s important now that action is taken to make sure these banks are clear of this corruption and, if not, that action is taken against them. \u201cIt will not do Britain\u2019s reputation any good at all to be tardy on this very significant issue.\u201d Speaking on behalf of the government, Conservative life peer Lord Bates said: \u201cWe\u2019re taking this very seriously because we realise the consequence of not doing so for the reputation of the City of London and the UK.\u201d In a statement following Hain\u2019s intervention in the House of Lords, McDonnell called on the government to consider a wide-ranging review into the role of UK financial institutions in global corruption. \u201cThis is the third high-profile money-laundering scandal to involve major British banks this year, and London has become notorious as a global centre for money laundering,\u201d he said \u201cThere are many hardworking people in our banking sector who will feel frustrated and dismayed by such stories, but they are let down by poor leadership and weak oversight that undermines the financial sector\u2019s reputation. \u201cIt\u2019s time the chancellor considered a wide-ranging independent inquiry that leaves no stone unturned in rooting out unlawful and damaging activity. \u201cThe government cannot continue to drag its feet on this matter as it will be the British banking industry as a whole that risks long-term damage to the reputation on which it depends.\u201d The chancellor has asked the Serious Fraud Office, National Crime Agency and the Financial Conduct Authority to seek information from HSBC and Standard Chartered about their potential involvement with transactions related to the Guptas. \u201cWe are not able to comment on the details of client transactions but can confirm that following an internal investigation accounts were closed by us in 2014,\u201d said Standard Chartered. It did not comment on the nature of the transactions but it is believed to have had concerns about indirect links to the Guptas, rather than accounts held at the bank. The inquiry into links between the Guptas and Zuma, a longstanding relationship known colloquially as \u201cZupta\u201d in South Africa, has also attracted FBI attention, it emerged on Thursday. US investigators have begun investigating individuals, bank accounts and companies potentially linked to the scandal, according to the Financial Times. Zweli Mkhize, the treasurer general of South Africa\u2019s ruling ANC party \u2013 and one of the most senior officials in the organisation \u2013 welcomed the international dimension to the investigation. \u201cIf there is any information suggesting corruption or irregularities it needs to be investigated across the borders, not to be restricted to South Africa,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may not be aware of the exact issues for companies not within South Africa but we will welcome any information that might help to shed light on what is happening in our country if it arrives from other countries. \u201cSo if the UK and US authorities are involved in an investigation we will keep ourselves interested in anything that involves companies that ultimately work in South Africa.\u201d The \u201cGuptagate\u201d affair has already claimed the scalp of UK public relations firm Bell Pottinger, which counted Gupta holding company Oakbay Investments as a client. Its business collapsed when it was struck off by the UK PR industry body for its work with Oakbay. The South African bosses of accounting firm KPMG, which audited Gupta family businesses, also quit amid the fallout from the affair.",

    "webTitle": "UK retail sales slump in September as inflation and wage woes bite", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "High street sales slumped last month, pushing the UK retail sector to its lowest growth rate in four years for the three months to the end of September as the impact of rising inflation and sluggish wage growth dented consumer spending power. Official figures showed the amount of goods bought by consumers fell 0.8% in September and set the UK on course for a period of slow growth in the run-up to Christmas. With only a fortnight before the Bank of England considers raising interest rates for the first time in 10 years, analysts said there was a downbeat trend in retail sales after the rate of growth in the third quarter fell to its lowest since 2013. Year-on-year sales volumes were up just 1.5% in the past three months, compared with about 4% annual growth between 2014 and 2016. Andrew Sentance, a senior economic adviser to the consultancy PwC, said the slowdown could be blamed on an inflationary squeeze that has seen real wages fall for most of the year. \u201cPrices of goods bought in shops, at petrol stations and online in September were 3.3% up on a year ago, whereas only a year ago they were falling by 1%,\u201d he said. \u201cThis surge in inflation, which mainly reflects the fall in sterling since the European Union referendum vote, is squeezing consumers and holding back the growth of retail spending in volume terms.\u201d Supermarkets and food retailers, department stores and petrol stations were hardest hit. Clothes shops, by contrast, generated 7% sales growth with their autumn collections. Sales of computer games, mobile phones and laptops also suffered, leading analysts to speculate that consumers were pausing their spending ahead of the Black Friday discounting period in November and Christmas. A delay in the launch of the iPhone 8 may also have hurt smartphone sales. Bank of England officials are expected to brush aside the weaker sales figures when they consider raising interest rates at their next meeting on 2 November. Signals from a majority of members of the monetary policy committee in recent months have indicated that the central bank will reverse the 0.25% cut made in August last year after the Brexit vote. With wages growth stuck at 2.2% and the consumer prices index measure of inflation at 3%, high street spending is likely to remain lacklustre for the rest of the year. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe latest figures will give the Bank of England further food for thought when it comes to their impending decision on interest rates. Indeed, a nasty case of indigestion is probably warranted. \u201cThe Bank doesn\u2019t want to apply the brakes to consumer spending if it is slowing down of its own accord already, though it does want to curb inflation and the glut in consumer borrowing.\u201d Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at the money broker WorldFirst, said the September results raised uncomfortable questions about where UK growth will emerge from in the last three months of the year. \u201cConsumption is the engine of the UK economy and the retail sector which, hammered by a weak pound, tighter margins and customers beset by real wage declines, are in the eye of the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will find out in the coming months whether this is consumers holding off on purchases in preparation for Christmas, or whether the Bank of England\u2019s messaging on interest rate rises has been enough to keep some hands in pockets. \u201cWe can but hope that this weakening sales pattern is also bringing about a slowing of the consumer credit expansion; retail sales in the past have been powered by a \u2018buy-now-pay-later\u2019 mentality and we continue to worry about a \u2018buy-now-default-later\u2019 reality.\u201d The value of sales dropped by 0.5% month on month, reflecting the fact that consumers had to spend more to buy the same quantity of goods. Almost all of the 1.2% growth over the past year has come from improving online sales as consumer seek bargains away from the high street. Ian Geddes, the head of retail at the consultancy Deloitte, said: \u201cOnline sales values have increased by 14% year on year. It now accounts for 17% of all retail spending, with consumers spending \u00a31.2bn a week. \u201cRecent company results have shown that online marketplaces have performed particularly well. We expect they are likely to continue to see sales growth in the coming months. \u201cConsumers like the convenience of being able to shop for big-name brands and niche labels all from the same online portal, as evident by the 40% growth in online sales of clothing and footwear this month.\u201d",

The government\u2019s behavioural insights team (Bit) \u2013 known as the Whitehall nudge unit because it designs policies that prod us towards acting differently \u2013 has revealed the details of more than 130 controlled trials conducted in the past year. They include tests based on behavioural economics to improve policy areas from health and welfare to consumer affairs. The findings come a week after Richard Thaler, one of the founding fathers of \u201cnudge\u201d theory, was awarded the 2017 Nobel prize in economics for his work exploring behavioural economics. Thaler, whose work examines how gut instincts can often overrule rational choices, was an adviser to the government when the then prime minister, David Cameron, first moved to create the nudge unit in 2010. Tests carried out by the Bit include putting \u201cstop\u201d signs on shelves next to sugary drinks in three hospital stores in Liverpool and rewriting letters to drivers caught speeding in the West Midlands to draw attention to why speed limits are set. The unit found the signs reduced purchases of high-sugar drinks by 7.3%, while in the West Midland there was a 20% reduction in reoffending by speeding drivers within a six-month period. Other trial results include sending text messages to the nominated \u201cstudy supporter\u201d of individual students resitting a GCSE subject suggesting questions they could ask to highlight key events or encourage discussions about learning. Students whose study supporters \u2013 a family member of friend tasked with helping them \u2013 received the messages were 27% more likely to pass their GCSEs. Although focused on the UK, the nudge unit has expanded globally since its was partially spun out from government in 2014, opening offices in New York, Sydney, Singapore and Wellington. The unit remains partly owned by the Cabinet Office, as well as by its staff and the innovation charity Nesta. Projects overseas in the past year include work to increase tax declarations in Mexico, involving 750,000 businesses, and improving court communications in Australia to cut reoffending rates for domestic violence. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the head of the civil service, said: \u201cAs the first government unit in the world dedicated to the application of behavioural approaches to policymaking, the team has brought novel solutions to the most persistent policy challenges.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Attempts by corporate shareholder activists to have BHP accept advisory resolutions from shareholders look set for defeat but the momentum for companies to take greater account of shareholders\u2019 views on matters of corporate governance, environmental sustainability and corporate ethics is mounting. BHP shareholders in the UK will be asked to approve two shareholder resolutions on Thursday, UK time, that seek to give shareholders a greater voice in the company\u2019s affairs. The second resolution, calling on BHP to reconsider its membership of mining lobby group the Minerals Council of Australia, has received the most attention. But the first resolution, which must pass to enable the second one to succeed, is potentially the more significant. It attempts to push the boundaries of shareholder democracy by proposing a change to BHP\u2019s constitution to allow advisory resolutions from shareholders. The resolutions are being proposed by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which has a small shareholding in BHP. It will be represented by a proxy at the UK annual general meeting. \u201cThe purpose of the first resolution is to put Australian shareholders on the same footing as UK shareholder in BHP,\u201d the centre\u2019s executive director, Brynn O\u2019Brien, said. The ACCR argues that these sort of resolutions are accepted in many jurisdictions including the UK, Canada and New Zealand. \u201cShareholders in the UK entity are permitted to put advisory resolutions,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cAustralian shareholders are prohibited by law from doing so, unless it is permitted under the company\u2019s constitution. That\u2019s why we are moving it.\u201d BHP is opposing both resolutions, arguing that to allow advisory resolutions would potentially interfere with directors\u2019 duties to act in the best interests of company. On the MCA membership, it says this is a matter for the board and is under review. \u201cThe proposed amendment to permit resolutions which are advisory would create uncertainty and confusion, whereas the division of responsibility for decision-making as between the board and shareholders needs to be clear,\u201d BHP said in its advice to shareholders on resolutions to be moved at the UK and Australian meetings. In relation to the argument about consistency with UK law, BHP says the ability to propose an advisory resolution has not been clearly established by UK case law. \u201cIn any event, shareholders already have various mechanisms available to them to express views and opinions,\u201d it argues. These include asking questions at AGMs and, in the case of strong disagreement, voting against directors. But increasingly shareholders are wondering whether there should be a greater ability to express their views through another mechanism that sits somewhere between the right to ask a question and the nuclear option of voting against directors\u2019 reappointments. Some of the larger shareholders hold consultations with senior management and directors of companies, where their views on corporate governance and environmental sustainability no doubt carry weight. But individual consultations have the downside that shareholders are not aware of what other shareholders feel \u2013 for example, whether most shareholders in BHP support or oppose the company remaining within the MCA. On Friday California\u2019s largest pension fund, CalPERS, said it would support both resolutions at the UK meeting. ACCR is hopeful other Australian-based superannuation funds may follow suit at the Australian meeting in November, despite the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors recommending against the resolutions to its members. At least one corporate governance adviser to shareholders, Regnan, whose members hold 5% of the ASX, has taken a middle course, providing an in-depth analysis of the impact of the resolutions, without making a firm call either way. It points out to members that an advisory resolutions would give clarity on the views of shareholders to the company and does not agree with the proposition that it would cut across directors\u2019 responsibilities. But it is believed to favour legislative change rather than a change to BHP\u2019s constitution, as the mechanism for getting this right for shareholders. It regards advisory votes as an important middle ground for shareholders to indicate their view to boards. BHP\u2019s review of its membership of the MCA, and the departure of its chief executive Brendan Pearson, may well be enough for BHP to stave off concerns among its shareholder community about the discordant messages coming from the company and the lobby group on climate change. BHP\u2019s response so far has been that it is doing enough. The company has ordered a review of its membership of industry associations, which is due by 31 December. It has undertaken to publish an analysis of its own positions and those of advocacy groups it funds, such as the MCA and the Business Council of Australia. But it has rejected a call to publish details of how much it pays, or to commit to ensuring consistency by withdrawing from groups that push views at odds with its own. O\u2019Brien said shareholders should have the right to know how much BHP is spending on the MCA and the impacts that uncertainty over energy policy, driven in part by MCA\u2019s strong advocacy against emissions trading schemes, has on BHP company, which although a miner, is also big energy user. That energy policy uncertainty is widely blamed for higher energy prices. Despite ACCR\u2019s acknowledging that both resolutions will fail, it regards the most recent campaign as a success. It has got major shareholders and companies to think about how they interact with each other and gauge the views of an increasingly environmentally conscious community.",

On the MCA membership, it says this is a matter for the board and is under review.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe proposed amendment to permit resolutions which are advisory would create uncertainty and confusion, whereas the division of responsibility for decision-making as between the board and shareholders needs to be clear,\u201d BHP said in its advice to shareholders on resolutions to be moved at the UK and Australian meetings.<br></p> <p>In relation to the argument about consistency with UK law, BHP says the ability to propose an advisory resolution has not been clearly established by UK case law.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn any event, shareholders already have various mechanisms available to them to express views and opinions,\u201d it argues.<br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Shareholders already have various mechanisms available to them to express views and opinions.</p> <footer> <cite>BHP</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These include asking questions at AGMs and, in the case of strong disagreement, voting against directors.<br></p> <p> But increasingly shareholders are wondering whether there should be a greater ability to express their views through another mechanism that sits somewhere between the right to ask a question and the nuclear option of voting against directors\u2019 reappointments.</p> <p> Some of the larger shareholders hold consultations with senior management and directors of companies, where their views on corporate governance and environmental sustainability no doubt carry weight.</p> <p>But individual consultations have the downside that shareholders are not aware of what other shareholders feel \u2013 for example, whether most shareholders in BHP support or oppose the company remaining within the MCA.<br></p> <p>On Friday California\u2019s largest pension fund, CalPERS, said it would support both resolutions at the UK meeting.<br></p> <p>ACCR is hopeful other Australian-based superannuation funds may follow suit at the Australian meeting in November, despite the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors recommending against the resolutions to its members.<br></p> <p>At least one corporate governance adviser to shareholders, Regnan, whose members hold 5% of the ASX, has taken a middle course, providing an in-depth analysis of the impact of the resolutions, without making a firm call either way.<br></p> <p>It points out to members that an advisory resolutions would give clarity on the views of shareholders to the company and does not agree with the proposition that it would cut across directors\u2019 responsibilities. But it is believed to favour legislative change rather than a change to BHP\u2019s constitution, as the mechanism for getting this right for shareholders.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/20/bhp-billiton-shale-sale-could-happen-not-a-drill\">BHP\u2019s shale sale could happen: this is not a drill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It regards advisory votes as an important middle ground for shareholders to indicate their view to boards.<br></p> <p>BHP\u2019s review of its membership of the MCA, and the departure of its chief executive Brendan Pearson, may well be enough for BHP to stave off concerns among its shareholder community about the discordant messages coming from the company and the lobby group on climate change.<br></p> <p>BHP\u2019s response so far has been that it is doing enough. The company has ordered a review of its membership of industry associations, which is due by 31 December. It has undertaken to publish an analysis of its own positions and those of advocacy groups it funds, such as the MCA and the Business Council of Australia. </p> <p> But it has rejected a call to publish details of how much it pays, or to commit to ensuring consistency by withdrawing from groups that push views at odds with its own.<br></p> <p>O\u2019Brien said shareholders should have the right to know how much BHP is spending on the MCA and the impacts that uncertainty over energy policy, driven in part by MCA\u2019s strong advocacy against emissions trading schemes, has on BHP company, which although a miner, is also big energy user. That energy policy uncertainty is widely blamed for higher energy prices.<br></p> <p>Despite ACCR\u2019s acknowledging that both resolutions will fail, it regards the most recent campaign as a success. It has got major shareholders and companies to think about how they interact with each other and gauge the views of an increasingly environmentally conscious community.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to a four-year low, with the labour market recording 12 straight months of employment gains \u2013 its longest stretch since 1994. Figures show the unemployment rate fell to 5.5% in September, its lowest rate since March 2013, as the government\u2019s National Disability Insurance Scheme contributes to a surge in health jobs and Western Australia continues to recover from the downturn in mining construction, adding 48,000 jobs over the last year. Some economists say the Reserve Bank may have to lift rates in early 2018, such is the expectation for jobs growth. HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham said businesses were reporting a sharp jump in their concerns about being able to find \u201csuitable labour\u201d, which is a sign that the labour market is tightening and wages may finally start facing modest upward pressure over the next 12 months. \u201cWith an improving labour market, inflation past its trough and growth expected to pick up, we see a cash rate hike in early 2018,\u201d he said. Bureau of Statistics figures show the unemployment rate declined to 5.5% in September, from 5.6% in August, in seasonally adjusted terms. However, the ABS is putting special emphasis on the \u201ctrend\u201d figures this month, because the trend figures smooth the more volatile seasonally adjusted estimates and provide the best measure of the underlying behaviour of the labour market. Trend figures show the unemployment rate fell to a four-year low last month, with full-time positions jumping by 16,000 people and part-time positions rising by 8,000 people. Over the past year, trend employment has increased by 2.8%, which is above the average year-on-year growth over the past 20 years (1.9%). The states with the strongest annual growth in trend employment over the last year are Queensland (4.1%), Tasmania (3.9%), Victoria (3.1%) and Western Australia (2.9%). \u201cThe trend unemployment rate had been hovering in the range of 5.6% to 5.8% for almost two years but has now dropped to a four-year low of 5.5%,\u201d Bruce Hockman, the chief economist for the ABS, said on Thursday. \u201cFull-time employment has now increased by around 271,000 persons since September 2016 and makes up the majority of the 335,000-person net increase in employment over the period.\u201d Economists say the seasonally adjusted figures, despite being more volatile than trend figures, also show unemployment has fallen to a new cycle low, with the unemployment rate slipping to 5.5% in September, down from 5.6%. Full-time employment rose by 6,100 last month, in seasonally adjusted terms, while part-time employment grew by 13,700. \u201cWe expect to see at least another 250,000 jobs added over the coming year,\u201d CBA senior economist Michael Workman said. \u201cThe unemployment rate, now at 5.5%, is forecast to move closer to the 5% level.\u201d The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, welcomed the employment figures, saying they proved the Coalition\u2019s policies were pro-growth. \u201cSince the government came to office in September 2013, 825,500 jobs have been created \u2013 an average of over 200,000 new jobs each year\u201d, she said. \u201cWhile ABS labour force figures can jump around from month to month, this is the 12th consecutive month where there has been an increase in jobs\u201d. But the shadow employment minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said the ABS figures also showed there were persistent underlying challenges in the labour market, including underemployment and low wages growth. \u201cWhile Labor welcomes the overall increase in jobs for the month of September, we note that there are 711,500 unemployed Australians, with 20,300 more people lining the unemployment queue than when the government was elected,\u201d he said. Economists said big services sectors such as health, education, retail, accommodation/tourism and transport had added nearly 400,000 new jobs over the past year. \u201cGiven the trends in household and government spending, the health sector is set to continue expanding, towards about 15% of the workforce in the next few years,\u201d Workman said. \u201cThe federal government\u2019s NDIS is forecast to add a total of 160,000 full-time equivalent jobs to the workforce over the next few years. We believe that it is already having a significant impact on health sector jobs.\u201d",
