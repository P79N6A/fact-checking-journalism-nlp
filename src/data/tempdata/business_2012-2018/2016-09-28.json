      "bodyText": "Shell and BP\u2019s pay plans encourage their bosses to dig for oil instead of investing in low-carbon energy and should be overhauled by shareholders, according to the campaign group ShareAction. Investors in the oil companies should use binding votes on pay policies next year to scrap short-term targets and reward chief executives for working towards the target set in Paris last December to limit global temperature increases to 2C or less, the responsible investment group says in a report. ShareAction said international pressure to reduce the impact of climate change was an existential threat to companies whose business depends on extracting fossil fuels. Persisting with pay plans that reward old measures of success risk Shell and BP becoming obsolete and ultimately going bust, the report says. Large companies face binding shareholder votes on three-year pay policies at next year\u2019s annual general meetings under rules introduced in 2013. Shell and BP\u2019s policies will take them up to 2020 when pledges under the Paris treaty could be strengthened, making the votes important, ShareAction said. Shareholders voted against the \u00a314m pay package for Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, and ShareAction said the pay policy votes would be a test of investors\u2019 resolve. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, was paid \u20ac5.85m (\u00a35m) last year. Catherine Howarth, ShareAction\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cResponsible investors who are serious about climate risk have a crucial opportunity to \u2018walk the talk\u2019 at BP and Shell next year by pushing for remuneration policies designed make these companies commercially resilient in a low carbon world \u2013 and voting down policies which fail that test.\u201d ShareAction said bonuses were largely tied to shareholder returns, project delivery, replacement of reserves and measures that encourage oil extraction. Long-term bonuses were paid after a few years yet the effects of Van Beurden and Dudley\u2019s decisions lasted for decades, ShareAction said. ShareAction called on investors to push BP and Shell to develop low-carbon energy, remove outdated performance measures and reward bosses for working towards the Paris targets. Van Beurden and Dudley have said they support a shift to renewable energy but have resisted pressure to make a radical switch to their companies\u2019 activities, which have attracted increasing opposition. BP\u2019s attempt to drill in a marine reserve in the Great Australian Bight was delayed for the third time on Wednesday and Shell has started production at the world\u2019s deepest underwater oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. Van Beurden has argued new oil supplies are needed to meet demand from a growing, more urban and prosperous global population. Dudley has said governments should do more to prevent energy being wasted and that oil companies should not be required to go lead the search for renewable sources. BP said it had been in talks with shareholders over pay and would consult them on its proposed pay policy later this year. Shell said it would read the report with interest.",

      "bodyText": "California\u2019s state treasurer announced on Tuesday that it is imposing a year-long ban on working with Wells Fargo after staff \u201cfleeced\u201d the bank\u2019s customers by creating 2m unauthorized accounts. The move by the US\u2019s largest state comes as the bank faces another grilling in Congress over the scandal that has already led the bank to pay $185m in penalties and clawback millions in bonuses from top executives. \u201cThe recent discovery that Wells Fargo &amp; Company fleeced its customers by opening fraudulent accounts for the purpose of extracting millions in illegal fees demonstrates, at best, a reckless lack of institutional control, and, at worst, a culture which actively promotes wanton greed,\u201d John Chiang, California\u2019s state treasurer, wrote in a letter to the bank on Tuesday. Chiang\u2019s office oversees nearly $2tn in annual banking transactions and manages a $75bn investment pool. \u201cMy office has long relied on Wells Fargo, our oldest California-based financial institution, as a partner to meet the state\u2019s investment and borrowing needs,\u201d wrote Chiang. \u201cBut, to borrow from Albert Einstein, \u2018Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with [larger] matters.\u2019 In the case of Wells Fargo, how can I continue to entrust the public\u2019s money to an organization which has shown such little regard for the legions of Californians who have placed their financial well-being in its care?\u201d The $185m settlement announced at the end of the month was a result of an audit that revealed that Wells Fargo staff created as many as 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit card accounts without customers\u2019 consent. As a result, the bank fired more than 5,300 employees. The bank denies that the creation of these accounts was part of an orchestrated effort. According to bank\u2019s critics, the bank\u2019s staff opened such unauthorized accounts in order to meet their sales quotas. The bank announced yesterday that it is terminating all of its sales quotas starting 1 October. In light of this scandal, Chiang\u2019s office has effective immediately suspended its investment in all Wells Fargo securities, use of Wells Fargo as a broker-dealer for investment purchases and use of Wells Fargo as managing underwriter on negotiated sales of California state bonds. These sanctions are in effect for 12 months during which Chiang asked that Wells Fargo quarterly report back its compliance with the terms of its $185m settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Los Angeles city attorney, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Chiang has also called for separation of the chief executive and chair positions at Wells Fargo \u2013 both of which are currently held by John Stumpf, a review of Wells Fargo\u2019s compensation practices and clawbacks of pay for those executives who are linked to the predatory sales practices. \u201cWells Fargo has diligently and professionally worked with the state for the past 17 years to support the government and people of California. Our highly experienced and proven government banking, securities and treasury management teams stand ready to continue delivering outstanding service to the state,\u201d a Wells Fargo spokesperson told the Guardian. \u201cWe certainly understand the concerns that have been raised. We are very sorry and take full responsibility for the incidents in our retail bank. We have already taken important steps, and will continue to do so, to address these issues and rebuild your trust.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The markets are fixated on the possible options for Deutsche Bank as it faces the prospect of a $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) penalty from the US authorities for mis-selling mortgage bonds a decade ago. A report has sparked speculation that the German government would step in if John Cryan, the Briton running Deutsche, fails to find a solution. Cryan has insisted Deutsche does not need help from the government and these are some of his options Talk down the fine Deutsche has insisted from the outset it would not pay $14bn to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), describing it as an \u201copening position\u201d to resolve the mis-selling of bonds between 2005-07. Talking it down seems to be the main route being adopted by Cryan who told the German newspaper Bild on Wednesday: \u201cThe Department of Justice will treat us with the same fairness as American banks that have already agreed on a compromise.\u201d Deutsche can probably afford up to \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.2bn), while the German bank is likely to be budgeting on closer to half that sum. Cash call One of the reasons the shares have collapsed to a near 30-year lows is the concern of shareholders that they will be asked to back a cash call. They had to dip into their pockets to find \u20ac11bn between 2013-14. Christopher Wheeler, banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, points out that with share prices at this level any cash call would dilute the already diminished worth of existing shareholders. It might also become a target for the amount that the DoJ asks for in any settlement. Deutsche is not breaching rules as they stand but would need more capital to reach levels that are expected to be set in the coming years. Don\u2019t pay bonuses Analysts at Autonomous have calculated the bank could save \u20ac2.8bn by restricting bonuses. \u201cBeing very tough on the 2016 bonus pool and requiring the forfeiture of unvested shares could be helpful,\u201d Bloomberg reported Autonomous\u2019s Stuart Graham as saying. Do another restructuring Cryan is asking for five years to carry out his turnaround plan, which includes selling off businesses as demonstrated on Wednesday when he sold Abbey Life and its 735,000 UK policyholders for \u20ac1bn. He wants to spin off the retail arm \u2013 Postbank \u2013 and sell down a stake in a Chinese bank. But the market is impatient and an enhanced strategy might buy him more time. Government help If all this fails, the according to a report in Die Zeit, the government might take a 25% stake and possibly facilitate a merger with Commerzbank. The idea has been denied at the highest level in Germany. If it was being hatched, under current EU rules, bond holders would have to take losses too in major test of the new regime, imposed only at the start of the year, intended to prevent taxpayers being on the hook for troubled banks.",

Deutsche is not breaching rules as they stand but would need more capital to reach levels that are expected to be set in the coming years.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t pay bonuses</h2> <p>Analysts at Autonomous have calculated the bank could save \u20ac2.8bn by restricting bonuses. \u201cBeing very tough on the 2016 bonus pool and requiring the forfeiture of unvested shares could be helpful,\u201d Bloomberg reported Autonomous\u2019s Stuart Graham as saying. </p> <h2>Do another restructuring</h2> <p>Cryan is asking for five years to carry out his turnaround plan, which includes selling off businesses as demonstrated on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/28/deutsche-bank-john-cryan-denies-asking-german-government-help\">when he sold Abbey Life and its 735,000 UK policyholders for \u20ac1bn</a>. He wants to spin off the retail arm \u2013 Postbank \u2013 and sell down a stake in a Chinese bank. But the market is impatient and an enhanced strategy might buy him more time.</p> <h2>Government help</h2> <p>If all this fails, the according to a report in Die Zeit, the government might take a 25% stake and possibly facilitate a merger with Commerzbank. The idea has been denied at the highest level in Germany. If it was being hatched, under current EU rules, bond holders would have to take losses too in major test of the new regime, imposed only at the start of the year, intended to prevent taxpayers being on the hook for troubled banks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Governments must defeat a rising tide of protectionism to prevent a further slowdown in global growth, the head of the International Monetary Fund has said. Christine Lagarde said policies that restrict trade were a form of \u201ceconomic malpractice\u201d that would choke off growth, hit jobs and reduce wages. Speaking in Chicago, she urged governments to act quickly to lower trade barriers to increase global growth and boost the incomes of the poorest. Western governments bore most of the blame for global growth becoming \u201cweak and fragile\u201d over the past few years and allowing protectionist policies to restrict trade flows, she said. She said the Brexit vote would have consequences for Britain and the world. Lagarde\u2019s call for governments to match their demands for greater global economic coordination with action to overcome trade barriers, comes a week before the IMF\u2019s biannual gathering in Washington. The UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, will join finance ministers and central bank governors at the meeting and the IMF will publish its latest health check on the global economy. Hammond is expected to tell Lagarde that Brexit presents the UK with an opportunity to open trade negotiations with a host of nations and maintain close links with the EU. The IMF is concerned that a hard Brexit will restrict trade flows between the world\u2019s largest trading block and the fifth largest economy in the world, undermining the prospects of a stronger recovery. Lagarde said: \u201cFor the past several years, the global recovery has been weak and fragile, and this continues to be the case today. Especially for advanced economies \u2013 while there are some good signs \u2013 the overall growth outlook still remains subdued. We continue to face the problem of global growth being too low for too long, benefiting too few. \u201cRising economic inequality is a phenomenon in many countries today, rich and poor, but it has really hit home in the advanced world right now, where real incomes for many have been declining \u2013 or growing at a much slower rate \u2013 and past economic achievements seem at risk. \u201cWhat this tells us is that governments must work harder to make growth inclusive.\u201d Lagarde\u2019s comments may be regarded as another veiled attack on the anti-free trade stance of the US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and nationalist politicians in Europe, who favour protecting domestic manufacturing jobs by imposing barriers on imported goods. Earlier this month she said there was a growing risk of \u201cpoliticians seeking office by promising to \u2018get tough\u2019 with foreign trade partners through punitive tariffs or other restrictions on trade\u201d. Her advice to governments was first to \u201cdo no harm\u201d by shutting doors to trade. \u201cIt is sure to worsen the growth outlook for the world and especially its weakest citizens \u2026 We need to rethink fundamentally how growth can be made more inclusive, and act accordingly.\u201d She said a backlash against central banks\u2019 low interest rate policies also endangered cheap credit, a key driver of growth. She said, however, that low interest rates were not enough on their own and should be allied with higher government spending. \u201cBy using monetary, fiscal, and structural policies in concert - within countries, across them, and consistent over time - we can make the whole greater than the sum of the parts.\u201d \u201cPessimists believe that our traditional means of monetary and fiscal policy are exhausted, but I beg to differ. In my view, there is more policy space \u2013 more room to act \u2013 than is commonly believed. It requires pushing harder on all policy levers and taking more advantage of the synergies between them,\u201d she said.",

Look at the share prices to see that investors agree. In the old pre-crisis days, banks traded at a premium to their book value on the reasonable assumption that the business of lending would tend to increase profits over time. These days discounts to book value are the norm for big banks. Low interest rates, accompanied by piles of government debt trading at negative yields, has made lending fundamentally less profitable.

The position is a mess. Put another way, big banks used to run on obscene levels of leverage and haven\u2019t found a new model to allow them to plod through the era of near-zero interest rates.

Yes, a demand for $14bn (\u00a310.8bn) \u2013 or possibly even half that sum \u2013 would probably trigger a need for more capital, as analysts say. But investors can also see that Deutsche is years behind even its peers in adapting to the new world. UBS rallied around its asset management division; Barclays sold its asset manager, shed many of its continental European business and is getting out of Africa. Deutsche, by contrast, has tried cutting costs but has not radically changed shape. Even now, the co-chief executive, John Cryan, talks about a restructuring that will take five years, a timescale that looks far too relaxed if he finds himself pleading with his shareholders to give him more capital at short notice. It is still quite possible that the DoJ\u2019s demand could fall from $14bn to $4bn, which would allow everybody to breathe more easily. But, given what\u2019s at stake, it would be amazing if German chancellor Angela Merkel and her officials are not working on contingency plans for Deutsche. She has to deny all such suggestions, of course, because there is no point fuelling the sense of crisis. But this crisis in confidence in European banks, with Deutsche at the centre, has been brewing for at least 12 months.

      "bodyText": "Senator Nick Xenophon has slammed the growing trend of companies paying million-dollar bonuses to chief executives for hitting vague performance targets. He said chief executives should not be getting bonuses for doing what they should be doing in the first place, and he will be raising the issue at the next senate economics committee. He joins a backlash of large superannuation funds, shareholders, and contrarian fund managers calling for corporate Australia to rein in the practice. The Greens Treasury spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, said the Greens would also be pushing to rein in executive pay. \u201cRight now, meeting these new targets is about as hard as limbo dancing under the Arc de Triomphe,\u201d Xenophon told Guardian Australia. \u201cThis needs to be on the agenda. Why should someone get a bonus because no worker died on their watch? It\u2019s offensive to what occupational health and safety ought to be about.\u201d The senators were responding to news that major companies like Woolworths, Commonwealth Bank, Telstra, and AGL Energy were increasingly setting \u201cnon-financial\u201d targets for their chief executive bonuses. The bonus payments are being made for progress in areas like company \u201cdiversity, inclusion, culture and safety,\u201d which are difficult to measure. The Australian Shareholders\u2019 Association this week criticised the $12.3m pay packet of the CBA chief executive, Ian Narev, saying the bank\u2019s move to change its bonus structure would make it easier for Narev to continue getting large payouts in the future. \u201cPreviously, CBA executives were measured against total shareholder return (TSR) and customer satisfaction hurdles for their long-term incentives,\u201d Goldin said this week. \u201c[But] in the 2015-16 financial year CBA did not meet its TSR hurdle. \u201cUnder the new changes the TSR component of the long-term incentive, which used to be worth 75%, has been reduced to 50%. A new hurdle measuring progress in the areas of diversity and inclusion, sustainability and culture will constitute 25%. \u201cWhilst the changes reflect important sentiments, in reality where hurdles are based on qualitative measures, which we see quite often in the short-term incentives, there is so much flexibility in interpretation that payment of the bonus will effectively be up to the board to decide.\u201d The head of equity fund Allan Gray, Simon Mawhinney, told the AFR on Wednesday that CEOs should not be getting multimillion-dollar bonuses because no employee had died. Andrew Mackenzie, BHP Billiton\u2019s chief executive, had his salary halved this year from $US4.58m to $US2.24m after he suggested to the board that he shouldn\u2019t get a bonus after 19 people were killed in a mining-dam failure in Brazil. \u201cIf they don\u2019t kill anyone, it is not that they should be paid another $1m bonus, they should get to keep their job,\u201d Mawhinney told the Australian Financial Review. Whish-Wilson told Guardian Australia that he had mixed views about non-financial targets for chief executives, because he would like companies to stop focusing solely on shareholder returns and start considering broader areas of corporate responsibility. \u201cThings like customers, employees, and community expectations are important,\u201d he said. \u201cBut having said that, they\u2019ve got to do it properly.\u201d He said the Greens want to introduce a broad \u201ccorporate responsibility mandate\u201d attached to CEO pay that goes beyond shareholder returns. But they also want to cap executive pay by anchoring it to the average employee\u2019s wages in a company. \u201cSet the cap at a multiple of the wage of the average employee in their businesses. I think that would be the simple way of getting rid of the bonus culture, and the sales culture, in these vertically integrated businesses,\u201d he said. In 2013 voters in Switzerland rejected a proposal to limit executives\u2019 pay to 12 times that of junior employees.",

      "bodyText": "Aston Martin\u2019s first powerboat has taken to the waves as the loss-making carmaker tries to return to profit by stamping its fabled marque on a range of luxury goods. In scenes seemingly designed for the opening credits of a James Bond film, Aston Martin unveiled the 37ft AM37 powerboat against the glamorous backdrop of the Monaco yacht show. The vessel, which will set buyers back about \u00a31.3m, is part of a turnaround plan designed to stem five consecutive years of losses. Aston Martin reported an operating loss of \u00a358.3m in 2015, partly due to an investment plan that its chief executive, Andy Palmer, hopes will breathe life into the company. Palmer\u2019s strategy involves extending the brand into other areas, such as clothing, handbags and even luxury apartments. Speaking this month at the opening of a store in Mayfair, London, designed to showcase such products, Palmer envisaged wealthy customers immersing themselves in an Aston Martin-themed world. He said: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if you\u2019re down in a luxury harbour somewhere staying in an Aston Martin apartment, with your Aston Martin parked in the car park, and your Aston Martin boat harboured outside.\u201d Many of the products in the Dover Street shop are the result of tie-ups with upmarket brands such as clothing firm Hackett London and Venetian lace maker Emilia Burano. Parents who want their baby to have wheels like MI6\u2019s top agent can buy a Silver Cross Surf pram, with the famous Aston Martin badge, for \u00a33000. The firm\u2019s attempts to turn around its fortunes have also seen it launch a new DB11, which officiallystarted rolling off the production lines at the group\u2019s Gaydon plant on Wednesday. While Aston Martin has been selling products other than cars for some time, the AM37 is the first vehicle it has produced that is not a car. Capable of racing across the waves at 50 knots, the boat was designed by \u201cmaster craftsmen\u201d who also worked on Aston Martin\u2019s DB11 and Vulcan models. It was built at a shipyard in Southampton, with nautical engineering expertise from the Dutch yacht-builder Quintessence Yachts. The company described the boat as a \u201cday cruiser\u201d. There vessel has room for up to eight passengers, and features mood lighting, air-conditioning, a fridge, microwave and coffee machine. Aspiring 007s in need of a nap can catch 40 winks thanks to a gadget almost worthy of Q \u2013 a table that converts into a bed. The windscreen is made from a single piece of sculpted glass, while a sliding roof allows the owner to cover the cockpit \u2013 as with a convertible car. The cockpit borrows other elements that will be familiar to owners of the firm\u2019s sports cars, including leather interiors, throttle handles and joystick. Aston Martin\u2019s chief creative officer, Marek Reichman, said: \u201cIt was important to us when considering this project to make sure that the boat design was as beautiful and timeless as our cars.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Serious Fraud Office steps up BHS investigation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office has stepped up its inquiries into the collapse of BHS and the conduct of the department store chain\u2019s former owner Dominic Chappell. The Guardian understands that the SFO has contacted individuals involved in running BHS before it fell into administration in April, and the administrators themselves, and asked for a series of documents. The SFO is thought to be particularly interested in the dealings of Chappell and his consortium, Retail Acquisitions, during the 13 months it owned the retailer. The move raises the possibility of the agency launching a formal investigation into the collapse of BHS and Chappell. The SFO always explores whether there is reasonable grounds to suspect that fraud has taken place before publicly announcing it is launching a full investigation. The demise of BHS led to 11,000 job losses and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Its failure is already under investigation by the Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator, but the SFO\u2019s interest raises the stake considerably because it has the power to bring criminal charges. Chappell controversially bought BHS for \u00a31 from Sir Philip Green in March 2013. The company collapsed just 13 months later, but Retail Acquisitions received at least \u00a317m from the retailer. A parliamentary investigation into events at BHS accused Chappell of having \u201chad his fingers in the till\u201d and helping to oversee the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of the business. The MPs labelled Chappell and the other directors of Retail Acquisitions as \u201cincompetent and self-serving\u201d. Chappell owes more than \u00a3500,000 to the taxman on the profits he made from owning BHS. Chappell has put the business that owes the tax, Swiss Rock Limited, into liquidation, meaning he could walk away without paying the bill. Swiss Rock is Chappell\u2019s personal business and was paid at least \u00a31.6m by BHS. It owes \u00a3365,000 in VAT and \u00a3196,306 in corporation tax, according to documents drawn up by Chappell and David Rubin &amp; Partners, the liquidator. The SFO confirmed that it was reviewing documents relating to BHS but was yet to open a formal investigation. A SFO spokesperson said: \u201cThe SFO confirms it is reviewing material in its possession. If the director considers there are reasonable grounds to suspect serious or complex fraud which meets his criteria, he will open a criminal investigation.\u201d Chappell declined to comment. He has previously said he \u201cearned\u201d the money paid out from BHS, that his \u201cconscience is very clear\u201d and his team \u201cdid the right thing, right the way through\u201d. Green remains in talks with the pensions regulator about a deal to bail out the BHS pension scheme. The billionaire tycoon, his family and other BHS investors collected more than \u00a3580m from the company during the 15 years he ran it. Green told MPs in June that he would \u201csort\u201d the pension deficit. However, he is yet to secure an agreement, despite pressure from MPs such as Frank Field, who has said Green should be stripped of his knighthood if he does not pump money into the pension scheme. Field chaired the parliamentary investigation into BHS alongside Iain Wright. The report concluded that the collapse of the company represented the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. The last of BHS\u2019s 164 shops closed in August. However, the Middle Eastern group that bought the BHS brand and international business out of administration will relaunch it on Friday as a website. BHS.com will sell a range of lighting and furniture, with plans to eventually sell kitchen and dining products and clothing. David Anderson, the managing director of BHS International, said the website would sell about 75% of the most popular online items before the original company fell into administration. He said: \u201cA huge amount of work has gone into rebuilding and launching BHS back into the UK as an online retailer. With a loyal British customer base of well over one million people and the fact that we have secured contracts with so many leading suppliers who are providing products that were among the most popular with our shoppers, we are in the best possible position for launch.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Serious Fraud Office has stepped up its inquiries into the collapse of BHS and the conduct of the department store chain\u2019s former owner Dominic Chappell.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that the SFO has contacted individuals involved in running BHS before it fell into administration in April, and the administrators themselves, and asked for a series of documents. The SFO is thought to be particularly interested in the dealings of Chappell and his consortium, Retail Acquisitions, during the 13 months it owned the retailer.</p> <p>The move raises the possibility of the agency launching a formal investigation into the collapse of BHS and Chappell. The SFO always explores whether there is reasonable grounds to suspect that fraud has taken place before publicly announcing it is launching a full investigation.</p> <p>The demise of BHS led to 11,000 job losses and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Its failure is already under investigation by the Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator, but the SFO\u2019s interest raises the stake considerably because it has the power to bring criminal charges.</p> <p>Chappell controversially bought BHS for \u00a31 from Sir Philip Green in March 2013. The company collapsed just 13 months later, but Retail Acquisitions <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-owner-retail-acquisitions-25m-administration\">received at least \u00a317m from the retailer</a>.</p> <p>A parliamentary investigation into events at BHS accused Chappell of having \u201chad his fingers in the till\u201d and helping to oversee the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of the business. The MPs labelled Chappell and the other directors of Retail Acquisitions <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-collapse-key-players-mps-report-sir-philip-green\">as \u201cincompetent and self-serving\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Chappell owes more than \u00a3500,000 to the taxman on the profits he made from owning BHS. Chappell has put the business that owes the tax, Swiss Rock Limited, into liquidation, meaning he could walk away without paying the bill.</p> <p>Swiss Rock is Chappell\u2019s personal business and was paid at least \u00a31.6m by BHS. It owes \u00a3365,000 in VAT and \u00a3196,306 in corporation tax, according to documents drawn up by Chappell and David Rubin &amp; Partners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/05/hmrc-dominic-chappell-tax-high-court-petition-bhs-swiss-rock\">the liquidator.</a></p> <p> The SFO confirmed that it was reviewing documents relating to BHS but was yet to open a formal investigation.</p> <p>A SFO spokesperson said: \u201cThe SFO confirms it is reviewing material in its possession. If the director considers there are reasonable grounds to suspect serious or complex fraud which meets his criteria, he will open a criminal investigation.\u201d</p> <p>Chappell declined to comment. He has previously said he \u201cearned\u201d the money paid out from BHS, that his \u201cconscience is very clear\u201d and his team \u201cdid the right thing, right the way through\u201d. </p> <p>Green remains in talks with the pensions regulator about a deal to bail out the BHS pension scheme. The billionaire tycoon, his family and other BHS investors collected more than \u00a3580m from the company during the 15 years he ran it. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/mps-sir-philip-greens-reputation-and-knighthood-depend-on-pension-offer\">Green told MPs in June that he would \u201csort\u201d the pension deficit</a>. However, he is yet to secure an agreement, despite pressure from MPs such as Frank Field, who has said Green should be stripped of his knighthood if he does not pump money into the pension scheme.</p> <p>Field chaired the parliamentary investigation into BHS alongside Iain Wright. The report concluded that the collapse of the company represented the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d.</p> <p>The last of BHS\u2019s 164 shops closed in August. However, the Middle Eastern group that bought the BHS brand and international business out of administration will relaunch it on Friday as a website. BHS.com will sell a range of lighting and furniture, with plans to eventually sell kitchen and dining products and clothing.</p> <p>David Anderson, the managing director of BHS International, said the website would sell about 75% of the most popular online items before the original company fell into administration.</p> <p>He said: \u201cA huge amount of work has gone into rebuilding and launching BHS back into the UK as an online retailer. With a loyal British customer base of well over one million people and the fact that we have secured contracts with so many leading suppliers who are providing products that were among the most popular with our shoppers, we are in the best possible position for launch.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hopes that Deutsche Bank can solve its current problems, along with a rise in oil prices, helped push European shares into positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 41.71 points or 0.61% at 6849.38 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.74% to 10,438.34 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.77% higher at 4432.45 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.54% better at 16,222.21 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.6% at 8740.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.13% to 563.15 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 29 points or 0.17%. Deutsche Bank ended the day up 2% at \u20ac10.765. Meanwhile in the oil market, Brent crude is 2.65% better at $47.19 on optimism that oil producers in Algeria will lay the foundations for a deal to curb production at November\u2019s Opec meeting. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here are the quotes from Christine Lagarde\u2019s comments on Deutsche Bank in her CNBC interview with Sara Eisen. Eisen: There are renewed concerns about the health of Europe\u2019s banking sector. Deutsche Bank is trading at a record low level. There\u2019s real worry about whether it has enough capital. Have you spoken to Chancellor Merkel about Deutsche Bank and the needs of the German banking sector? Lagarde: Well, we completed back in June, actually, a financial sector assessment of the German banking system. And it is a system that is critically important with some systemic players. Deutsche Bank is certainly one of them. So I think we all have a stake in making sure that this situation is addressed, that the right measures are taken, that we don\u2019t fall into over dramatisation either. But I trust that these measures will be taken. Eisen: Do you trust that the German government would step in if capital is necessary? Lagarde: You know, this is something that they\u2019re going to debate amongst themselves. I don\u2019t see... Eisen: Would you recommend it? Lagarde: I don\u2019t see that particular institution as - at a stage where state intervention is absolutely called for at the moment. And I would hope that the right measure are taken internally so that the whole financial sector in Germany is solid and that systemic players [are] strengthened. It has recovered a bit today, by the way. Eisen: Yes, it has. But do you see it as a global systemic risk? Lagarde: Deutsche Bank is a systemic player. Let\u2019s face it. Because it has a lot of relationship with many other banks around the world. And it is an international player as well. So it\u2019s important that it be consolidated and, you know, it has a solid base. Let\u2019s also be realistic. But it needs measures. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has said she does not believe Deutsche Bank needs state aid at the moment, in comments to CNBC: And here\u2019s a suggestion of a unexpected rescuer for Deutsche Bank: Bloomberg reports: Yigit Bulut, a chief adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the country must consider using a new wealth fund or a group of state-owned banks to buy the Frankfurt-based company. Bulut made the proposal on Tuesday via his Twitter account, saying Germany\u2019s largest lender should be made into a Turkish bank. The stock of Europe\u2019s biggest investment bank has slumped by more than 50 percent over the past year, falling to a record low on Tuesday, over concerns about its weakening financial position and penalties in the U.S. tied to mortgage-backed securities. Bulut\u2019s comments come after Moody\u2019s Investors Service on Sept. 23 cut Turkey to junk, citing slowing economic growth and deteriorating credit fundamentals. \u201cFor months on TV programs, I\u2019ve been calling on Turkey\u2019s private and public capital: \u2018Some very good companies in the EU are going to fall into trouble and we need to be ready to buy a controlling stake in them,\u2019\u201d Bulut wrote on Twitter. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be happy to make Germany\u2019s biggest bank into Turkish Bank!!\u201d And back with Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen: Asked about whether the German government should rescue Deutsche Bank he said he does not comment on individual banks. But: More from ECB president Mario Draghi who is speaking after his appearance at the German parliament.He paints a rosy picture of his session before the MPs: (ZIRP is the zero interest rate policy instigated by central banks such as the ECB) And one German response: A bigger than expected rise in US weekly gasoline stocks has offset a surprise fall in crude stocks to take the shine off oil prices. Gasoline stocks rose by 2m barrels, compared to expectations of a 178,000 increase. Crude stocks however fell by 1.9m barrel rather than the 3m barrel rise forecast by analysts. Oil prices have been volatile in recent days as key producers meet in Algeria, with hopes that the outline of a deal on reducing output could be agreed for the next Opec meeting in November. After early gains on hopes of a deal, crude prices have come off their best levels on the US data. Brent crude is currently up just 0.2% at $46.06 a barrel having climbed as high at $47.19, while West Texas Intermediate is 0.13% lower at $44.61. Although the congressional session is mostly focused on regulation, Yellen did comment on interest rates. She said there was no fixed timetable for raising rates, but most Fed members believed it was appropriate to move if the economy remained on track. So December then? US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments on supervision and regulation of financial institutions, being delivered to a congressional committee, can be read here. She said the Fed had implemented standards designed to limit the financial stability risks posed by the largest banks, in the wake of the global financial crisis. But she said they must endure small and medium sized banks did not face undue regulatory burdens. And she adds: Looking forward, we must continue to monitor for the emergence of new risks, since another key lesson from the crisis is that financial stability threats change over time. She concludes: Our post-crisis approach to regulation and supervision is both forward-looking and tailored to the level of risk that firms pose to financial stability and the broader economy. Standards for the largest, most complex banking organisations are now significantly more stringent than standards for small and medium-sized banks, which is appropriate given the impact that the failure or distress of those firms could have on the economy...We anticipate taking additional actions in the near term to further tailor our regulatory and supervisory framework. Yet even as we finalize the major elements of post-crisis reform, our work is not complete. We must carefully monitor the impact of the regulatory changes we have made and remain vigilant regarding the potential emergence of new risks to financial stability. We must stand ready to adjust our regulatory approach where changes are warranted. The work we do to ensure the financial system remains strong and stable is designed to protect and support the real economy that sustains the businesses and jobs on which American households rely. US markets have moved ahead in early trading, with oil prices on the rise as producers meet in Algeria. Meanwhile investors are also awaiting a testimony from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen before a congressional committee. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 38 points or 0.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.16% higher and the Nasdaq composite up 0.12%. And Draghi concluded by repeating his calls for policy makers to implement structural reforms: For long-term interest rates to rise in the future we therefore need more investment and structural reforms to lift growth and productivity. As Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said in this house a couple of weeks ago [when he presented the budget for 2017]: we will only get out of this phase of low interest rates if we have more sustainable growth in Europe... At the height of the crisis, all Member States and citizens showed an enormous commitment to keeping the euro area together when the critics were already talking about the euro\u2019s demise. But we cannot stop here: we need to make sure not only that the euro survives, but that our Economic and Monetary Union thrives. If we want to succeed, we will need to find common solutions for the problems that we all face... If we want savers to benefit from higher interest rates in the future, we will need to create investment opportunities to put these savings to a productive use. This is about raising productivity and employment. This is about structural reforms that are a necessary complement to our monetary policy. And Member States have to do their part. And with some blaming the ECB\u2019s negative rate policy for - at least in part -Deutsche Bank\u2019s woes, Draghi said: We should also consider the full effect of low interest rates on banks. Those who blame ECB policy for the mixed performance of certain German financial firms have been very vocal. But what has been forgotten is that many banks have been able to more than offset declining interest revenues with higher lending volumes, improved loan performance and lower interest expenses, all of which are beneficial to both the banks and their customers. The ECB\u2019s monetary policy is not the main factor for the low profitability of banks. While some banks\u2019 business models may indeed need to adapt to the current low interest rate environment, they also need to address their own structural issues, such as overcapacity, the stock of non-performing loans and the potential impact of technological innovation. Low profitability is closely linked to low operational efficiency. In Germany cost to income ratios are on average relatively high compared to other jurisdictions. Let us be clear, however, there is no one size fits all banking model and we have different types of banks that are successfully operating in Germany and in the euro area. Draghi has previously commented that he thinks there are too many banks in Europe. Draghi: We should also not forget that people in your constituencies are affected in different ways by our measures. They are affected as savers, borrowers or taxpayers, and in many cases as all three. What a household may lose in terms of little interest on their bank account, it might save in lower mortgage payments for their home. And it might benefit from rising bond and stock prices in their retirement fund. In fact, evidence shows that between 2008 and 2015 interest payments by households in Germany, as a percentage of gross disposable income, fell more sharply than interest earnings. And the low financing costs for government bonds help to balance the budget and reduce debt at a considerable speed. This is good news for the Finance Ministry - and thus for taxpayers - which saved in 2015 alone approximately EUR 28 billion on lower than expected interest payments. On savers, he says: Yes, the current low interest rate environment reduces the nominal return on saving accounts. But what counts for savers is not the nominal interest rate but the real interest rate, which is the nominal interest rate minus inflation. Real rates are also low, but there have been many episodes of low, or even negative real interest rates in Germany well before the introduction of the euro, as a recent Bundesbank study has shown. Moreover, savers can on average still earn satisfactory rates of return from diversifying their assets, even when interest rates on deposit and savings accounts are very low. This has also been the case in Germany according to another recent Bundesbank study. But most importantly, whatever financial assets savers hold, they will benefit from a recovery of the economy. So the interest of all of us, including German savers, is the highest possible sustainable growth in Germany and the euro area. Draghi continues: Our measures have delivered. We estimate that they will raise the inflation rate by more than half a percentage point, on average, over 2016 and 2017. They will also contribute to increasing real euro area GDP growth by more than one and a half percentage points cumulatively between 2015 and 2018, which will support job creation. ECB president Mario Draghi is defending the bank\u2019s actions, including negative interest rates, to the German parliament, at a time when savers in particular are unhappy at the effect on their nest eggs. In his speech released by the ECB, he says: First, I want to explain why we are pursuing our policies. I want to show how our monetary policy has maintained price stability and countered the threat of a new \u201cGreat Depression\u201d. Our measures are working: they are contributing to keeping the recovery on track, thus creating jobs and ensuring a recovery that ultimately also benefit savers and pensioners in Germany and the euro area as a whole. But I do understand that people have concerns. We take these concerns seriously. I will therefore discuss in more detail \u2013 and this is my second point \u2013 how our measures affect people\u2019s finances and welfare. As with any monetary policy decision, our measures have distributional effects on citizens. But, on balance, savers, employees, entrepreneurs, pensioners and taxpayers across the euro area, including in Germany, are better off because of our actions \u2013 today and tomorrow. Finally, I will talk about what else is needed. The ECB does not operate in a vacuum: other economic policies are essential to complement our monetary policy. Without them there will be no strong and sustainable recovery. These other policies are a precondition for interest rates to rise again. History may be on Deutsche Bank\u2019s side, at least where negotiations with the US authorities are concerned. Reuters columnist Dominic Elliott has totted up the fines paid by other big banks for mis-selling toxic loans in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, and argues that a $14bn penalty for Deutsche is unfair. Instead, something in the $5bn (or lower) ballpark might be appropriate. He writes: Deutsche Bank can take some heart from previous U.S. mortgage fines. Shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank by assets have dropped almost a fifth since it confirmed that the United States Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to settle charges of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Final bills paid by other banks suggest Deutsche will hand over a fraction of that amount. Calculating penalties is an inexact science. But one way to assess how much Deutsche might pay is to look at the fine as a proportion of the mortgage-backed securities it issued. Bank of America, for example, settled on a sum worth just over 2 percent of the instruments it underwrote, says KBW. Citigroup was the hardest hit so far, with fines totaling 11 percent of its issuance, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. Apply that range to the estimated $67 billion of securities that Deutsche underwrote \u2013 and deduct the $1.9 billion it has already forked out to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \u2013 and the remaining fine could be anything from $200 million to $5.5 billion. That might not be all hard cash, either. Settlement bills can include so-called consumer relief \u2013 loan forgiveness or extra credit offered to borrowers over defined periods. More here: Another fine mess Although Deutsche Bank clearly has problems, some analysts argue that its troubles are being overstated. Reaching an agreement with the Department of Justice to pay rather less than $14bn for misselling mortgage-backed securities would remove one dark cloud, and free it up to raise fresh capital if needed. Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital, explains how Deutsche has some firepower left: At the end of June, its core tier one capital ratio stood at 10.8% - well above the minimum required by regulators since the financial crisis, albeit below its main peers. Deutsche is pretty well capitalised and it could raise fresh capital \u2013 this would hit the share price but it\u2019s not the end of the world. And it has plenty of assets it can sell quickly to raise the ratio if required. Selling the asset management arm might be required, although this would be negative for earnings growth going forward. He also argues that we\u2019re not facing a repeat of the 2008 crisis (as UBS chairman Axel Weber said this morning). It\u2019s not a Lehmans moment in the offing. Banks are generally better capitalised and able to cope with adverse shocks. And Deutsche\u2019s derivatives exposure can be overstated. These exposures are netted out and hedged so it\u2019s not like Deutsche could lose the trillions of dollars as is sometimes hinted at. Nevertheless, these derivatives are hard to value, particularly post-Brexit, and therefore pose a risk, while there is a worry is that a lower credit rating will make it harder to deal in these derivatives, hitting earnings. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t in a fix: Deutsche\u2019s problem is not capitalisation \u2013 it\u2019s just that its costs have soared (mainly through litigation and fines) and it\u2019s not that profitable any more. That is a much longer-term question about its future than whether it\u2019s in need of a bailout to boost some arbitrary capital requirement. Deutsche has to face down the short hedgies first and then look to raise capital. In that sense a \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 kind of nod from Berlin may help.\u201d How things change... Back in London, tech giant Apple has just announced plans to build a new headquarters at Battersea Power Station. The new \u201cApple Campus\u201d, on the south of the River Thames, will take up all six floors of office space at the former power plant, currently being redeveloped. Around 1,400 Apple staff from across London will move to the new site. Battersea Power Station is one of the biggest brick-built structures in the world, and a rare example of something that can be truly called \u2018iconic\u2019. It stopped generating electricity in 1983, and stood derelict for decades before a Malaysian consortium bought it in 2012. A spokesperson for the German finance ministry has officially denied Die Zeit\u2019s report that the government was preparing an emergency rescue plan for Deutsche Bank. Martin J\u00e4ger just told a government press conference in Berlin: \u201cThe German government is not preparing a rescue plan, and there is no reason for such speculations\u201d J\u00e4ger also declined to comment on whether there had been any meetings to discuss the situation at Deutsche Bank. And asked if Deutsche Bank is \u2018systemically important\u2019, he replies that everyone knows the importance of the company. It\u2019s been quite a dramatic morning. Tara Cunningham of the Daily Telegraph sums up the twists and turns so far.... Optimism that Deutsche Bank can ride out the crisis has pushed shares higher across Europe this morning. Germany\u2019s DAX index is leading the way, up almost 1%. with Deutsche Bank (+1.8%) leading the charge. In London, the FTSE 100 index is up 52 points, or 0.8%, at 6860. John Cryan\u2019s insistence that he\u2019s not seeking help from Angela Merkel has calmed the markets, despite the threat of a huge fine from the DoJ. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says fears of a \u201cbanking meltdown\u201d are easing, for now. The bank is faced with a $14bn that is roughly the equivalent to the current \u20ac15 billion market cap. With the government clearly unwilling to bail out the bank, it instead falls upon the firm to start negotiating down the bill and selling off assets, as we have already seen with today\u2019s sale of Abbey Life insurance group to Phoenix Life. However, there is an argument to be had that the decision from US Department of Justice to completely destabilise the European banking system as retribution for Deutsche Bank\u2019s role in the disruption of the US financial system is far from helpful. The size of the bill seems excessive at best and without the ability to negotiate down the amount, we could see one of the biggest banks in mainland Europe split up. Just in: Germany\u2019s finance ministry is telling reporters that Die Zeit\u2019s story about a rescue is \u201cfalse\u201d. They insist that a rescue plan is not being prepared, and there\u2019s no reason to speculate about this. Here\u2019s our Berlin correspondent, Philip Oltermann, on Die Zeit\u2019s claim of a rescue plan: The German government is working on an emergency rescue plan for Deutsche Bank in spite of the struggling bank\u2019s boss claims that state aid is \u201cout of the question\u201d, according to information obtained by weekly Die Zeit. Angela Merkel\u2019s government is preparing a two-stage plan for the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d whereby the US justice department sticks to a threatened $14 billion legal settlement to close out mortgage-securities probes, while Germany\u2019s largest lenders fails to raise enough capital to pay the fine, the newspaper claims in an article published tomorrow. The first stage would involve attempting to find a solution whereby Deutsche Bank sells parts of its business to a German or foreign company, while the state would issue guarantees for potential losses. The second stage, which would only apply if such a private solution was to fail, would involve a state-sponsored bailout. According to Die Zeit\u2019s research, shared with The Guardian ahead of publication, the German government is \u201cdebating a state takeover of as much as 25 per cent\u201d of the bank. One advantage of such a solution is that such an intervention would allow the German government to push Deutsche Bank towards a fusion with Commerzbank, of which around 15% are already state-owned. However, a state-sponsored bailout for Deutsche Bank would provide much embarrassment for a lender whose former boss Josef Ackerman said in 2008 that he would be \u201cashamed\u201d to take money from the state \u2013 as well as a German government which has been insisting on limiting state aid for ailing banks in southern Europe. The bailout would also come with considerable economic risk. Under a new rule put into force across the EU at the start of the year, no bank can be bailed out with public money until creditors accounting for at least 8 per cent of the lender\u2019s liabilities have contributed towards footing the bill. Deutsche Bank would thus potentially have to become a high-profile test case for this new \u201cbail-in\u201d regime. Die Zeit\u2019s story about a secret rescue plan for Deutsche Bank is now online, here: Bundesregierung bereitet Notfallplan f\u00fcr Deutsche Bank vor I\u2019ve skimmed through it, and.... It says that German Federal Government and the supervisory authorities are preparing an emergency plan for Germany\u2019s largest lender, according to officials in Berlin, Brussels and Frankfurt. It would be triggered if Deutsche Bank needed to raise additional capital to resolve its disputes with the US justice department, and can\u2019t raise it from the markets. Under the plan, Deutsche could sell some assets to other banks -- possibly with some form of government guarantee attached. And there has also been talk of the government taking a 25% stake in Deutche. However, the government continues to hope that this won\u2019t be needed. Importantly, some government officials favour leaving Deutsche Bank to the EU resolution mechanism - under which creditors and customers are bailed-in. However, that could lead to \u201cnew unrest in the financial markets\u201d, Die Zeit adds. Some breaking news from the aviation industry quickly, as British Airways owner IAG announces a partnership with Qatar Airways that will see them co-operate on a route network covering 70 destinations. The two carriers said the tie-up would give passengers a wider choice of flights, a broader range of fares and more benefits for members of their frequent flyer programmes. The agreement involves code-sharing - where airlines sell each other\u2019s seats on certain flights - on all non-stop flights between UK and Doha, allowing the firms to expand their roster of destinations. Willie Walsh, IAG\u2019s chief executive, says: \u201cThis agreement will benefit customers by giving them access to more destinations through Qatar Airways\u2019 extensive network. It will also allow us to provide easier journeys with better aligned schedules, more frequencies and improved flight transfers.\u201d The agreements comes into force on 30 October. Deutsche Bank shares are losing some of their early gains, as investors digest today\u2019s twists and turns. They\u2019re currently up 1.85% at \u20ac10.745, having hit their lowest level in 30 years on Tuesday. Reuters is reporting that Bafin, Germany\u2019s financial watchdog, is not working on a rescue plan for Deutsche. Here\u2019s the snap: Die Zeit\u2019s report of a contingency plan for Deutsche Bank has caused a frisson of excitement. Laura Noonan, the Financial Times\u2019 investment banking correspondent, tweets: Here\u2019s Holger Zschaepitz of Welt: Steve Hawkes of The Sun takes a broader view: And here\u2019s analyst Gary Jenkins: NEWSFLASH: German newspaper Die Zeit is reporting that Angela Merkel\u2019s government is drawing up a contingency plan for Deutsche Bank. Bloomberg and Reuters have the details: This plan would be triggered if Deutsche Bank needed fresh capital, and couldn\u2019t raise it in the markets. In the \u2018worst case scenario\u2019, this would see the German government take a 25% stake in the bank. However, the German government hopes that Deutsche won\u2019t need support. Minouche Shafik, deputy governor of the Bank of England, also argues that this isn\u2019t a Lehman moment.... The Wall Street Journal reckon that Angela Merkel has four options to help Deutsche Bank. They are.... 1) Drive that $14bn fine down. Put pressure on the lender to negotiate a smaller settlement with the Justice Department, while using back channels between Berlin and Washington to push for leniency 2) Bend the rules. Berlin could use a loophole in the bank-rescue legislation that allows a precautionary state recapitalization of a bank that has failed a stress test. The finance ministry could try to persuade the bank\u2019s supervisor to test Deutsche\u2019s capital cushion, allowing the government to step in with a capital injection should the bank fail the test. 3) Push Deutsche Bank to raise funds. The government could seek to engineer private-sector backing for Deutsche Bank or encourage it to divest its trophy asset-management unit, DWS, potentially worth several billions of euros\u2014a scenario bankers and Deutsche Bank staff have speculated about internally\u2014and wouldn\u2019t involve tapping public coffers. 4) Merge Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, the country\u2019s second largest lender. Analysts said this in itself wouldn\u2019t magically improve the quality of the merged entity\u2019s balance sheet. But because the government holds a 15.6% stake in Commerzbank, a legacy of a 2009 bailout, such a deal could be used as a backdoor to inject capital into Deutsche Bank without appearing to do so. Full details here: Deutsche Bank Puts Germany in a Bailout Bind Deutsche Bank is leading the top risers on the Frankfurt stock exchange, following Cryan\u2019s interview and the near-\u00a31bn sale of Abbey Life this morning. Axel Weber, the chairman of Swiss bank UBS, insists that Deutsche Bank won\u2019t cause a repeat of the Lehman Brothers crisis that rocked the world economy eight years ago. Speaking on Bloomberg TV this morning, Weber says banks have a lot more capital than before the last crisis, and regulators have made the linkages between individual banks much safer. Weber (a former president of the Bundesbank), says: Banks have raised capital by 7 times, some by 10 times, relative to pre-crisis. The system itself, with all the re-regulation, is much more stable, and so are the individual players. The interlinkages between banks have largely been reduced to a sustainable level. In my view, the system is much more stable now. Q: So, this is not a Lehman moment? No, we are very far in terms of how solid banks are now, from where we were in 2007- 2008, Weber replies. Worried about Deutsche Bank? Confused about how Germany\u2019s largest lender got into such a gro\u00df pickle? Wondering if Angela Merkel might have to step in? Our Q&amp;A has everything you need to know: Shares in Deutsche Bank have jumped by 3.3% at the start of trading in Frankfurt. They have risen to \u20ac10.89, up from \u20ac10.50 last night. But that\u2019s still barely half their value a year ago. Even two weeks ago, they were worth \u20ac13bn - before the DoJ hit Deutsche with the threat of a $14bn fine. Investors may be reassured by John Cryan\u2019s promise that Deutsche Bank hasn\u2019t asked chancellor Merkel for help, and his optimism that US regulators will compromise. Newsflash: Deutsche Bank has just agreed to sell Abbey Life, its UK life assurance group, to \u00a3935m. Deutsche are selling the business to Phoenix Group, Britain\u2019s largest owner of life assurance funds. This should give Deutsche some much-needed extra capital, to help pay that US fine. However, the deal will also trigger a \u00a3800m pre-tax loss (due to goodwill impairment). Deutsche Bank are tweeting the key points from CEO John Cryan\u2019s interview to Bild: The boss of Deutsche Bank has insisted that his company will not need government help, as the crisis swirling around Germany\u2019s largest lender intensifies. John Cryan used an interview with Bild, Germany\u2019s largest newspaper, to reject reports that Deutsche may need state aid. He firmly denied reports that he had asked Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, for assistance. \u201cAt no point did I ask the chancellor for support. Neither did I suggest anything like that.\u201d Accepting government support is \u201cout of the question for us\u201d, Cryan insisted, adding that raising new capital is \u201cis currently not an issue.\u201d He also argued that Deutsche has \u201cfewer risks in the book than before\u201d and is \u201ccomfortably equipped with free liquidity.\u201d Here\u2019s the full interview: \u201cStaats-Hilfen sind kein Thema\u201d (translation: State Aid is Not an Issue). Fears over Deutsche Bank have been growing, since it emerged this month that the Department for Justice is planning to fine the bank $14bn for mis-selling toxic mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Cryan, though, is confident that the DoJ can be haggled down, telling Bild that: \u201cIt was clear from the beginning that we would not pay this sum. The Department of Justice will treat us with the same fairness as American banks that have already agreed on a compromise.\u201d It\u2019s true that regulators can be \u2018haggled down\u2019. However, banking analysts fear that Deutsche would struggle to pay a fine larger than $6bn or so. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. On the agenda today.... Investors around the globe are watching Deutsche Bank closely, after the bank\u2019s shares hit a 30+-year low yesterday (more on that shortly). Royal Bank of Scotland is also in focus, after paying a \u00a3846m fine to US regulators for misselling mortgage bonds to credit unions a decade ago. Further fines are expected.... Opec energy ministers are due to hold an informal meeting in Algeria this afternoon; could they make noises about a proper deal to freeze production soon? European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is heading to Berlin for a grilling from German MPs over monetary policy. Global stock markets look calm, with investors still nervously eying the US presidential election race. There\u2019s also a flurry of corporate news, with supermarket chain Sainsbury, holiday firm TUI and personal healthcare group PZ Cussons all reporting.

Deutsche Bank is trading at a record low level. There\u2019s real worry about whether it has enough capital. Have you spoken to Chancellor Merkel about Deutsche Bank and the needs of the German banking sector?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Well, we completed back in June, actually, a financial sector assessment of the German banking system. And it is a system that is critically important with some systemic players. Deutsche Bank is certainly one of them. So I think we all have a stake in making sure that this situation is addressed, that the right measures are taken, that we don\u2019t fall into over dramatisation either. But I trust that these measures will be taken.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Do you trust that the German government would step in if capital is necessary?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: You know, this is something that they\u2019re going to debate amongst themselves. I don\u2019t see...</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Would you recommend it?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: I don\u2019t see that particular institution as - at a stage where state intervention is absolutely called for at the moment. And I would hope that the right measure are taken internally so that the whole financial sector in Germany is solid and that systemic players [are] strengthened. It has recovered a bit today, by the way.</p> <p><strong>Eisen</strong>: Yes, it has. But do you see it as a global systemic risk?</p> <p><strong>Lagarde</strong>: Deutsche Bank is a systemic player. Let\u2019s face it. Because it has a lot of relationship with many other banks around the world. And it is an international player as well. So it\u2019s important that it be consolidated and, you know, it has a solid base. Let\u2019s also be realistic. But it needs measures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebed58e4b049b74e4cb037\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T16:19:53.538Z\">5.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has said she does not believe Deutsche Bank needs state aid at the moment, in comments to CNBC:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WilfredFrost/status/781160889294532608\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Deutsche Bank is a systemic player&quot; on global stage says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lagarde\">@Lagarde</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaraEisen\">@SaraEisen</a> but feels it&#39;s solid at the moment</p>&mdash; Wilfred Frost (@WilfredFrost) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WilfredFrost/status/781160889294532608\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/781162495125913600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">LAGARDE/CNBC: DON&#39;T SEE NEED FOR DEUTSCHE BANK STATE AID NOW - MNI</p>&mdash; Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/781162495125913600\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebec9fe4b049b74e4cb033\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T16:17:25.072Z\">5.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s a suggestion of a unexpected rescuer for Deutsche Bank:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/advdesk/status/781150019378356224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Erdogan Chief Adviser Yigit Bulut Says Turkey Should Consider Buying Deutsche Bank <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DB&amp;src=ctag\">$DB</a><br>LOL</p>&mdash; Advisory Desk (@advdesk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/advdesk/status/781150019378356224\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Bloomberg<strong><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-28/erdogan-adviser-says-turkey-should-consider-buying-deutsche-bank\"> reports</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yigit Bulut, a chief adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the country must consider using a new wealth fund or a group of state-owned banks to buy the Frankfurt-based company.

While some banks\u2019 business models may indeed need to adapt to the current low interest rate environment, they also need to address their own structural issues, such as overcapacity, the stock of non-performing loans and the potential impact of technological innovation. Low profitability is closely linked to low operational efficiency. In Germany cost to income ratios are on average relatively high compared to other jurisdictions.

Shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank by assets have dropped almost a fifth since it confirmed that the United States Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to settle charges of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Final bills paid by other banks suggest Deutsche will hand over a fraction of that amount.</p> <p>Calculating penalties is an inexact science. But one way to assess how much Deutsche might pay is to look at the fine as a proportion of the mortgage-backed securities it issued. Bank of America, for example, settled on a sum worth just over 2 percent of the instruments it underwrote, says KBW. Citigroup was the hardest hit so far, with fines totaling 11 percent of its issuance, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.</p> <p>Apply that range to the estimated $67 billion of securities that Deutsche underwrote \u2013 and deduct the $1.9 billion it has already forked out to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) \u2013 and the remaining fine could be anything from $200 million to $5.5 billion. That might not be all hard cash, either. Settlement bills can include so-called consumer relief \u2013 loan forgiveness or extra credit offered to borrowers over defined periods.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/past-mortgage-fines-give-deutsche-room-for-hope/\">Another fine mess</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DominicElliott/status/781099707946917889\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I calculate range of &quot;fair&quot; U.S. Justice Department fine for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeutscheBank\">@DeutscheBank</a> based on what other banks have paid as between $200m and $5.5bn <a href=\"https://t.co/TJ8F58HUc1\">https://t.co/TJ8F58HUc1</a></p>&mdash; Dominic Elliott (@DominicElliott) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicElliott/status/781099707946917889\">September 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebc07be4b049b74e4caf0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T13:22:54.257Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2eff76dc43e736487554f4a44242260e19dd183b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eff76dc43e736487554f4a44242260e19dd183b/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Deutsche Bank logo adorns a wall at the company\u2019s headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Although Deutsche Bank clearly has problems, some analysts argue that its troubles are being overstated.</strong></p> <p>Reaching an agreement with the Department of Justice to pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/deutsche-bank-14bn-dollar-fine-doj-q-and-a\">rather less than $14bn for misselling mortgage-backed securities</a> would remove one dark cloud, and free it up to raise fresh capital if needed.</p> <p><strong>Neil Wilson</strong>, analyst at <strong>ETX Capital,</strong> explains how Deutsche has some firepower left:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the end of June, its core tier one capital ratio stood at 10.8% - well above the minimum required by regulators since the financial crisis, albeit below its main peers.</p> <p>Deutsche is pretty well capitalised and it could raise fresh capital \u2013 this would hit the share price but it\u2019s not the end of the world.

Nevertheless, these derivatives are hard to value, particularly post-Brexit, and therefore pose a risk, while there is a worry is that a lower credit rating will make it harder to deal in these derivatives, hitting earnings.</p> </blockquote> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t in a fix:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deutsche\u2019s problem is not capitalisation \u2013 it\u2019s just that its costs have soared (mainly through litigation and fines) and it\u2019s not that profitable any more.

According to Die Zeit\u2019s research, shared with The Guardian ahead of publication, the German government is \u201cdebating a state takeover of as much as 25 per cent\u201d of the bank.</p> <p>One advantage of such a solution is that such an intervention would allow the German government to push Deutsche Bank towards a fusion with Commerzbank, of which around 15% are already state-owned.</p> <p>However, a state-sponsored bailout for Deutsche Bank would provide much embarrassment for a lender whose former boss Josef Ackerman said in 2008 that he would be \u201cashamed\u201d to take money from the state \u2013 as well as a German government which has been insisting on limiting state aid for ailing banks in southern Europe.</p> <p>The bailout would also come with considerable economic risk. Under a new rule put into force across the EU at the start of the year, no bank can be bailed out with public money until creditors accounting for at least 8 per cent of the lender\u2019s liabilities have contributed towards footing the bill. Deutsche Bank would thus potentially have to become a high-profile test case for this new \u201cbail-in\u201d regime.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eb9337e4b01b56deffc2b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T10:15:59.209Z\">11.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Read the Die Zeit story on Deutsche Bank here</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Die Zeit\u2019s story about a secret rescue plan for Deutsche Bank is now online, here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2016-09/deutsche-bank-rettungsplan-finanzaufsichtsbehoerde?utm_campaign=Zeit.de-Wirtschaft&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">Bundesregierung bereitet Notfallplan f\u00fcr Deutsche Bank vor</a></h2> <p>I\u2019ve skimmed through it, and....</p> <p><strong>It says that German Federal Government and the supervisory authorities are preparing an emergency plan for Germany\u2019s largest lender, according to officials in Berlin, Brussels and Frankfurt.</strong></p> <p>It would be triggered if Deutsche Bank needed to raise additional capital to resolve its disputes with the US justice department, and can\u2019t raise it from the markets.</p> <p>Under the plan, Deutsche could sell some assets to other banks -- possibly with some form of government guarantee attached.</p> <p>And there has also been talk of the government taking a 25% stake in Deutche.

      "bodyText": "The family that turned a Harrow taxi firm into a postal company competing with the Royal Mail are in line for a \u00a3120m windfall after an agreed bid from Deutsche Post. UK Mail was founded by chairman Peter Kane in 1971 but he himself will get no direct benefit from the \u00a3243mtakeover offer, since he recently passed on his remaining stake to his family. Kane is notoriously publicity-shy but uses his wealth to invest in West End Musicals, including Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s which starred Pixie Lott. The biggest winner from the takeover will be Kane\u2019s son John, who will receive \u00a360m. His brother Michael, who used to be involved in the business, is set for \u00a323m, his ex-wife Ghislaine \u00a314m and his daughter Joanna Bailey and her husband \u00a313m. With other family members including a young son, the Kanes own just over 50% of the business between them. The deal is likely to intensify competition in Britain\u2019s postal market, putting further pressure on Royal Mail by allowing UK Mail to capitalise on the German group\u2019s greater financial and operational firepower. News of the bid sent UK Mail\u2019s shares up by 43%, as investors welcomed the deal. . It comes after a difficult period for UK Mail, in which problems at its automated sorting facility led to two profit warnings last year and the departure of the then chief executive, Guy Buswell. Peter Kane said the offer from Deutsche Post, which is listed publicly and also owns logistics company DHL, gave shareholders the opportunity to cash in at a significant premium to the levels at which the share price had traded in recent months. \u201cThe board believes that UK Mail will benefit significantly from becoming part of Deutsche Post DHL, and will be better positioned to continue to develop our parcels and mail businesses with the benefit of Deutsche Post DHL\u2019s greater financial and operational resources,\u201d he said. \u201dThere will be significant synergies including additional volumes flowing through our network from Deutsche Post DHL\u2019s global operations.\u201d UK Mail delivers parcels and mail from 50 sites, using 2,440 vehicles. J\u00fcrgen Gerdes, a board member at Deutsche Post DHL, said the deal would help the company satisfy increasing demand for cross-border parcel deliveries, driven by growth in e-commerce. \u201cWith this acquisition, we will further extend our network and have a strong foothold in Europe\u2019s three largest e-commerce markets \u2013 the UK, Germany and France \u2013 which account for more than 60% of online retail in the continent,\u201d he said. The postal market is undergoing a period of change, with declining volumes of letters and an increase in parcels as shopping moves online. This has led to fierce competition in the UK market, threatening the dominance of Royal Mail. The now privatised Royal Mail is the biggest parcel operator, but UK Mail, says it is the next largest group in the market, delivering for businesses such as O2 and TalkTalk. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cIf competition weren\u2019t already tough enough in the UK postal market, the big boy of European mail has just dived into the mix. \u201cDeutsche Post\u2019s decision to buy struggling UK Mail adds a new player to the market with a meaningful UK footprint and lots of fire power. That has hit Royal Mail today, on fears that pricing pressure, that looked to be easing, might be about to enter a second round.\u201d Royal Mail shares were down 3.3%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prolonged unconventional, quantitative easing (QE) monetary policy of the Bank of England has effectively hijacked fiscal policy from the government, with disastrous effects on savers and pensioners and in a way that makes wealth inequality worse more generally. The reasons for this are subtle, which is why they are also insidious. As quoted by Steve Baker MP in a recent House of Commons debate on QE, John Maynard Keynes once explained how, via inflation, \u201cgovernments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens,\u201d and, \u201cwhile the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth\u201d. As arguably the single most influential economist of the 20th century, we should give Keynes\u2019 thoughts on this matter due consideration. It may be true that consumer price inflation remains relatively low due to what economists call slack in the labour market, which tends to reduce or prevent wage growth. But because of the artificially low asset yields associated with QE, savers and pensioners now find they must outright liquidate assets in order to maintain a middle-class lifestyle or to enjoy a comfortable retirement. While that can work for a time, in the end it erodes the middle-class capital base and leaves households with less to pass down to their children and grandchildren. QE enriches those who have already accumulated enough assets such that they generate sufficient income without the need to liquidate their accumulated capital base. As the Bank itself determined in a 2012 paper analysing, among other things, the distributional effects of QE, \u201cthe top 5% of households own 40% of the assets,\u201d and hence they have been the primary beneficiaries of the rampant asset price inflation following the financial crisis of 2008 and large devaluation in sterling. QE can also be an effective tool to weaken the currency, which makes imports and basic goods more expensive, squeezing the middle class further. While some argue that it is possible to \u201cdevalue your way to prosperity\u201d, history has not been kind to the countries and empires that have followed this path. Countries that have pursued stable or outright strong currency policies have generally fared much better. Germany and Switzerland come to mind, as does the pre-1970s United States. Claudio Borio, the head of the monetary and economic department at the Bank for International Settlements, claimed in a recent speech that radical unconventional monetary policy \u201cis just fiscal policy dressed up\u201d. Indeed, it is time to start calling QE what it is: a hidden tax on the wealth of middle-class savers and pensioners which, on the one hand, the government can use to finance the deficits associated with a large, modern welfare state and, on the other, redistribute wealth to the top 5% of households. That is not only monetary policy. It is fiscal policy, which the Bank has de facto taken over. It remains to be seen whether it was a wise decision, but UK citizens recently exercised their democratic right by voting to leave the comparatively less democratic EU. The government has already set about considering what changes its newfound independence might enable it to make to fiscal policy, such as lowering the corporate tax rate to attract much-needed private investment. It would be even more refreshing to see it reassert its right to determine fiscal policy more generally by telling the Bank to end QE and with it the associated insidious, pernicious distributional effects in favour of the wealthy. The economic policy focus can then turn to where it truly belongs, on how best to generate increasing rates of savings, investment and productivity growth, and in a way that does not disproportionately benefit any one group \u2013 whether rich or poor \u2013 over another. The British public was recently allowed to vote on whether they wished to leave the EU. Shouldn\u2019t they also be allowed to vote on whether they would like their accumulated private savings to be devalued?

Underlying profits fell to \u00a314.1m last year from \u00a315.6m in 2014 as the brand pumped money into its first flagship store on Regent Street in London and opened a new outlet store at Bicester Village in Oxfordshire. Founded in Scotland in 1856, the company holds two royal warrants. It is famous for its hard-wearing wellingtons and outerwear, and has capitalised on its popularity with celebrities such as Alexa Chung and Kate Moss. Sales rose 19% in 2015 to \u00a3113.7m, and Hunter\u2019s chief executive, Vincent Wauters, said the company was in a strong position despite a challenging retail backdrop in 2016, with new styles in footwear, outerwear and accessories performing well. \u201cWe recognise that 2016 has presented a challenging retail environment in general, particularly in North America. We have invested to strengthen the brand fundamentals, in particular with the introduction of a seasonless core concept launching in October of this year. \u201cWe have put particular focus on growing the Hunter team, building for the future by promoting from within and investing in new talent. The measures we have put in place in 2016 will put us in a strong position going into 2017, as we continue to grow and realise the brand\u2019s true potential.\u201d Wauters said that sales at Hunter\u2019s second global flagship store in Tokyo, opened in March, had been good so far. Other investments over the year included the expansion of its warehouse and distribution facilities, and development of a global online shop. The company has been majority-owned by funds managed by the private equity firm Searchlight Capital Partners since January 2012.",

    "webTitle": "Europe's banks 'not investable' says top banker amid Deutsche Bank crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Europe\u2019s most senior bankers has said the embattled sector is \u201cnot really investable\u201d, in remarks that underline the difficulties the continent\u2019s big banks could face if they have to raise new funds. Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Credit Suisse, issued the warning about the problems the sector faces as the focus remained on Deutsche Bank and its battle to reduce a $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) penalty from the US authorities for mis-selling mortgage bonds. On Wednesday the German government raced to deny a report that it was preparing a bailout plan under which it might take a 25% stake in Deutsche Bank, which is the country\u2019s biggest bank. With assets half the size of the German economy it is regarded as the bank that poses the biggest risk to global financial stability. Shares in Deutsche Bank have plunged to near-30-year lows this week amid reports \u2013 which were then denied \u2013 that it had asked for German government intervention to help reduce the punishment from the US Department of Justice (DoJ). Their decline was arrested on Wednesday, when the bank sold a UK insurance company for \u20ac1bn; they closed 2% higher at \u20ac10.76. Thiam told a Bloomberg conference that Europe\u2019s banks were in a \u201cvery fragile situation\u201d and said there was doubt that European banks still had a viable business model. Concerns about rock-bottom interest rates and how much capital banks should hold meant returns to investors were too low, making banks \u201cnot really investable\u201d. Credit Suisse is among a number of other banks, including Barclays, facing a penalty from the DoJ. Fears that Deutsche Bank might have to tap its investors for cash are among the reasons its shares have plunged, and raised fears that it could present a Lehman Brothers-style moment for the markets. However, top bankers and policymakers all played down the prospects of a repeat of the collapse of Lehman in 2008. John Cryan, the Briton who has run Deutsche Bank for 15 months, spoke out to insist he had not asked Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, for help in dealing with the DoJ in an attempt to arrest the decline in the bank\u2019s shares. \u201cAt no point did I ask the chancellor for support. Neither did I suggest anything like that,\u201d he said. Such a request would be \u201cout of the question\u201d and he could not understand how \u201canyone could claim that\u201d. The claims were raised last week in a German magazine. Within hours of his remarks to Bild newspaper a report in Die Zeit set out a two-stage plan being prepared by Merkel\u2019s government for the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d, under which the DoJ settlement is not reduced and Germany\u2019s biggest lender fails to raise enough capital. In an article to be published on Thursday, Die Zeit claims that the first stage would involve attempting to find a solution, with Deutsche Bank selling parts of its business to a German or foreign company, and the state issuing guarantees for potential losses. The second stage, which would only apply if such a private solution were to fail, would involve a state-backed bailout. According to Die Zeit, the German government is \u201cdebating a state takeover of as much as 25%\u201d of the bank. This might facilitate a merger with Commerzbank, which is 15% state owned. The reportwas denied by the German finance ministry and financial regulator. Martin J\u00e4ger, a spokesman for the German finance ministry, said: \u201cThe German government is not preparing a rescue plan and there is no reason for such speculations.\u201d Cryan gave the interview as Deutsche Bank sold its Abbey Life insurance business, with 735,000 UK policyholders, for \u20ac1bn (\u00a3860m). This will generate an \u20ac800m loss for the German bank, but improve its financial strength by making it smaller. The bank also told its staff that it was not planning to raise capital or in need of state aid, although speculation about possible options for its future included a bid from a new Turkish national wealth fund. Bloomberg reported that Yi\u011fit Bulut, a chief adviser to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had suggested Germany\u2019s largest lender should be made into a Turkish bank. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund which has ranked Deutsche Bank as the world\u2019s riskiest bank, said state help was not needed. Speaking to CNBC, Lagarde said: \u201cI don\u2019t see that particular institution as ... at a stage where state intervention is absolutely called for at the moment. I would hope that the right measures are taken internally so that the whole financial sector in Germany is solid and that systemic players [are] strengthened.\u201d Axel Weber, the chairman of UBS and former president of the German Bundesbank, said fears of a rerun of the 2008 banking collapse were misplaced. He said banks had between seven and 10 times more capital than eight years ago. The deputy Bank of England governor Minouche Shafik also played down any comparison. Weber told Bloomberg TV: \u201cThere is a much more stable system. In my view the system is much more stable now. I think we are very far in how solid banks are now, from where were in 2007 and 2008.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will probably have to take further action if the UK is to avoid a damaging slowdown following the Brexit vote, according to one of its deputy governors. Minouche Shafik said more monetary stimulus \u2013 in the form of an interest rate cut or an increase in the quantitative easing (QE) programme \u2013 might be needed to limit the negative impact of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Giving a speech in London, Shafik said: \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the UK is experiencing a sizeable economic shock in the wake of the referendum. It seems likely to me that further monetary stimulus will be required at some point in order to help ensure that a slowdown in economic activity doesn\u2019t turn into something more pernicious.\u201d The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee announced a package of measures in August in an attempt to limit the risks posed to the UK economy following the EU referendum on 23 June. The moves included a cut in interest rates to a new all-time low of 0.25%, and an extension of its QE programme, which involves buying government and corporate bonds from financial institutions in the expectation that banks will then lend the proceeds back into the economy. The Bank has signalled that it is willing to do more, but Shafik conceded that the evidence so far suggested the Brexit vote had not dealt as severe a blow to the economy as expected. \u201cThe likely timing of [further] stimulus will depend on the continued evolution of the data over the coming weeks and months. Thus far, the welcome improvement in the forward-looking indicators suggests that the slowdown may not be as sharp or as sudden as we might have feared.\u201d Last week a fellow MPC member, Kristin Forbes, said the British economy\u2019s performance since the vote indicated there was little need to cut rates further. Shafik\u2019s influence over monetary policy will also be limited because she is leaving the Bank in February to head the London School of Economics, having served half of a five-year term. Shafik added in the speech at an event hosted by the Bloomberg news organisation in London that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future trade agreements \u2013 following a severing of links with Brussels \u2013 was reducing companies\u2019 appetite to invest. \u201cThe reality of the protracted process of withdrawing from the EU means we still know very little about the nature of our future trading arrangements, and this uncertainty is weighing on prospects for business investment. \u201cOur agents around the country report that some new projects are being scaled back or deferred until the outlook becomes clearer.

      "bodyText": "A disappointing trading update from transport group Stagecoach has seen its shares go into reverse. The company - whose businesses include joint ventures with Virgin Rail - said full year earnings should be in line with expectations although given a lack of clarity on the outlook for the economy \u201cthere is a higher than usual degree of forecasting uncertainty.\u201d It said regional bus revenues fell 1.9% in the first 16 weeks of the new financial year, while UK rail rose only 1.7% compared to a 2.8% increase last year, including Virgin Rail East Coast. Virgin Rail West Coast revenues rose by 4.7%. North America fell by 3.3%, hit by lower petrol prices. The company said: Passenger volumes continue to be weaker than we have seen in the UK bus (regional operations) division in recent years... Our London division has experience a small net reduction in contracts with Transport for London. UK rail industry revenue growth has slowed over the last year and the outlook for the industry remains uncertain, particularly given its sensitivity to economic conditions....We believe the reduced rate of growth reflects the effects of weakening consumer and business confidence, increased terrorism concerns, sustained lower fuel prices, the related effects of car and air competition, slower UK GDP growth and slowing growth in real earnings. At our Virgin Trains East Coast franchise....we have taken a range of positive actions aimed at significantly growing revenue over the remaining term of the franchise. The company\u2019s shares are currently down 2.9p or 1.3% to 207.1p, having earlier fallen as low as 195.6p. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said: Today\u2019s trading update confirmed that in the first 16 weeks of the current fiscal year revenue growth in UK bus remained sluggish while divisional rail revenue growth continues to decelerate. We retain our hold recommendation. Despite the attractive dividend yield, we are mindful of the challenges at Virgin East Coast and would like to see evidence that the company can achieve the required rate of revenue growth in the high single digits. Liberum said: The further slowdown in rail revenue growth (to +1.7% in the first 16 weeks from +2.8% last full year) is likely to cause concern. And Shore Capital, which has a buy recommendation on the company, said: Overall today\u2019s statement is, in our opinion, disappointing, with a number of negative trends across the group, many of which are out with the control of management. What is within management control however is mileage and costs, [and] it appears to us that a reduction in mileage and a clear focus on cost control is behind the re-iteration of management\u2019s expectations for adjusted earnings per share for the year to April 2017.",

Travel group TUI is among the biggest gainers so far, up after it raised its profit guidance for the year. It said it expected 12%-13% growth compared to an earlier estimate of a 10% rise. Holiday firms have been hit by fears of terrorist attacks, and concerns about a falling number of UK tourists, thanks to the weakness of the pound following the Brexit vote. But TUI said bookings from Britain were up 5% in the summer, defying these fears. It is also less exposed to troubled Turkey than rival Thomas Cook. Analysts at Stifel said: In the UK market, demand has remained resilient with TUI benefiting from its positioning in the upper end of the mass market with a product offering which has improved in recent years. Neither Brexit nor the weakness of sterling appears to have impacted demand with revenues and bookings up 5% for Summer 2016. In Germany, while market conditions are difficult, TUI has increased market share and benefited from its more integrated model. Losses in France should be materially reduced from the \u20ac40m incurred last year, but against this profits are expected to be lower in Nordics, largely as a result of reduced demand to Turkey and the contribution from Belgium will be impacted by the attack at Brussels airport. Elsewhere hopes that Deutsche Bank could dig its way out of its current problems lifted its hard hit shares and supported the banking sector. Barclays is 1.75p better at 167.7p while Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 2p to 176.6p after it agreed to pay $1.1bn to settle some of its US mortgage claims. Despite little chance of oil producers agreeing to curb output at a meeting in Algiers, crude prices have edged higher after their recent falls, with Brent 0.72% higher at $46.3 a barrel. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: European equity markets are positive, following oil prices higher, as investors eye Algiers in the hope that today\u2019s OPEC meeting will reach some compromise. Although an agreement to curb output today would be a major surprise, the debate may pave the way for a potential deal at their next meeting. So commodity prices have moved ahead, helping mining companies gain ground. Anglo American has added 25.4p to 942.2p while Rio Tinto has risen 66.5p to 2526.5p. But Sainsbury is down 7.3p to 243.5p as it reported a 1.1% fall in second quarter like for like sales and warned of a continuing tough market. Royal Mail is down 8.2p at 494.8p on competition fears as Deutsche Post agreed to buy smaller rival UK Mail for \u00a3243m. Liberum analysts said: UK Mail competes with Royal Mail in bulk letters and parcels.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pressure on the North Sea oil industry is likely to persist, according to the Bank of England governor, as the sharp drop in prices takes its toll on the wider economy. Mark Carney suggested that there was no respite in sight for the oil and gas industry, where the downturn has led to the loss of thousands of jobs. \u201cIt is difficult. I don\u2019t want to underplay it,\u201d he said in an interview with the Herald newspaper in Scotland. \u201cIt is a challenging environment and, given global prices, that may persist for some time.\u201d The price of Brent crude oil fell to a 12-year low of just below $30 (\u00a323) a barrel in January, from a high of $115 in summer 2014. On Wednesday morning, it was trading at slightly above $46. Visiting Scotland for the first time since before the 2014 independence referendum, Carney acknowledged the effect of declining North Sea oil revenues on the broader Scottish economy. \u201cIt is having a multiplier impact,\u201d he said. The Scottish government\u2019s North Sea revenues collapsed in 2015-16 to \u00a360m from \u00a31.8bn a year earlier. It was a far cry from the rewards reaped by Scotland in 2008-09, when North Sea revenues were \u00a311.6bn. Income from the oil industry is a key factor in debates over Scotland\u2019s ability to fund its public finances as an independent nation. Carney said the UK economy was slowing in the second half of the year, following Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. \u201c[The Bank] had expected in August that the economy would slow materially during the second half of this year, relative to relatively strong growth in the first half of this year. Broad brush, that is what we are seeing,\u201d he said. The governor said the Brexit vote had caused considerable uncertainty, affecting some areas of the economy more than others. \u201cWe are seeing a softening in business investment, a softening in the real estate market,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, the consumer is holding up. In the middle is the housing market, where there are mixed signals.\u201d Carney said the Bank had attempted to support the economy during this period of heightened uncertainty, with a package of measures including a cut in interest rates and an extension of the bond buying scheme known as quantitative easing. \u201cThe decision to leave does bring a period of adjustment. What we have looked to do is provide some support to the economy to help with that adjustment, both in terms of improving the ability of banks to lend \u2026 and improving the cost of borrowing by lowering interest rates and making some asset purchases,\u201d he said. In the longer term, the prospects for the UK economy were good, Carney said. \u201cI have every confidence that this economy will adjust, and will adjust well.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s offshore oil and gas regulator has asked for more information about BP\u2019s controversial application to drill for oil in a marine reserve in the Great Australian Bight, which has already been rejected twice. The Australian regulator \u2013 the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) \u2013 has told BP it must submit more information for the regulator to decide whether the company\u2019s environmental plan is acceptable. Nopsema did not say what aspect of the environmental plan did not contain enough detail, but said a request for more information was \u201ca normal part of Nopsema\u2019s environment plan assessment process\u201d. BP has already had two environmental plans for drilling in the Great Australian Bight rejected after Nopsema found they did not meet regulatory requirements. The new request comes amid concern about systemic problems in bolts used in offshore drilling equipment, which US regulators have said are likely to one day cause a catastrophic oil spill, like BP\u2019s 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. After environmental groups accused BP of not releasing enough information about its plans, last week it released summaries of oil-spill modelling and oil spill response plans. Andrew Hopkins, emeritus professor at the Australian National University, analysed the documents and said they fell short of industry best practice, and would not be allowed in some other jurisdictions. The new request for information does not count as an invitation to resubmit the plan, or a rejection, so it does not appear to put the project any closer to rejection or acceptance. Environmental groups have jumped on the news and called for the regulator to terminate plans for drilling in the Great Australian Bight. The Wilderness Society\u2019s South Australian director, Peter Owen, said the risks posed by the project were too great. \u201cThe time has come for this project to be terminated once and for all,\u201d he said. \u201cOne would expect BP to go to great lengths to show the regulator it had learnt from its Gulf of Mexico disaster and submit an application that far exceeds the required standards. Instead, it has again submitted a substandard application in the hope it will be approved.\u201d Nathaniel Pelle, Greenpeace Oceans campaigner, said the request showed the plan was \u201cfull of holes\u201d and was too dangerous to proceed. \u201cBP have again failed to gain approval to drill \u2013 this third strike should see them out for good,\u201d he said. A BP spokeswoman said: \u201cThis is not a rejection or an acceptance. It is a request to clarify aspects of our plan and for us to provide information that has not been included in the plan.\u201d Nopsema has asked BP to submit the information by 28 October but said BP could request more time. In a media release, Nopsema said: \u201cIf a titleholder is able to demonstrate through their environment plan that they meet the criteria for acceptance then Nopsema must accept the plan. However, following a reasonable opportunity to modify and resubmit their environment plan, if a titleholder is unable to meet the criteria for acceptance, Nopsema must refuse to accept the plan.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s sales have dropped further after it was forced to cut prices amid heavy competition from discount rivals. Sales at stores open for more than a year fell by 1.1% in the three months to 24 September, compared with the 0.8% decline reported for the previous three months. Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s slid 3.5% to 242.2p in morning trading, as City analysts said the supermarket had slightly underperformed against expectations and appeared to be under more pressure in comparison with Morrisons and Tesco. Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, said the fall in sales was driven by price cuts. Although a 1% dip in prices resulted in a drop in the total value of Sainsbury\u2019s sales in the quarter, the reductions drew more people to Sainsbury\u2019s tills and meant the group sold a higher volume of goods. Coupe said there had been no discernible impact on customer behaviour after the EU referendum, and he thought there would not be any impact on shopping unless and until the UK\u2019s step away from the union started to \u201cinterfere with or influence people\u2019s day-to-day lives\u201d. \u201cWe expect the market to remain competitive and the effect of the devaluation of sterling remains unclear,\u201d Coupe added. \u201cHowever, Sainsbury\u2019s is well positioned to navigate the changing marketplace and we are confident that our strategy will enable us to continue to outperform our major peers.\u201d He said Sainsbury\u2019s would continue to make \u201ctargeted investments\u201d in lowering prices, and had recently cut the price of nappies by 36% and broccoli by 20%. The chief executive said food prices might continue to fall as a result of strong harvests in northern Europe and a drop in the price of oil. But he said there were other inflationary pressures, including a drop in the value of the pound against the dollar and the euro, and a drought in Brazil that had raised the price of coffee. While food sales fell, Sainsbury\u2019s performance was lifted by a 4% increase in general merchandise sales. But the supermarket admitted that its clothing sales had decreased slightly, despite the launch of Tu Premium, a more upmarket version of the Tu brand. Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s first ever quarterly fall in clothing sales had come as a number of other retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer and Primark, also reported falls after unseasonably cool weather in June and warm weather in September. \u201cRelative to the competition, we have done well,\u201d he said. \u201cClothing has probably been our most challenging area during the course of the last quarter.\u201d Sales at Argos, which Sainsbury\u2019s took control of three weeks ago, rose 2.3% at stores open more than a year in the three months to 27 August, its best performance since 2014. It was a big step up in pace from the 0.1% reported for the previous quarter \u2013 Argos\u2019s first quarter of growth in more than a year. Sainsbury\u2019s said it was not able to provide detail on how Argos\u2019s sales had improved so dramatically and Coupe said his view of the merger had not changed. \u201cI have never not been confident about the deal. Customers\u2019 habits are changing, shopping habits are changing very rapidly, driven by the rise of digital. Customers demand more utility and more speed, and Argos gives us the ability to serve customers in an increasingly rapidly changing world,\u201d Coupe said. Sainsbury\u2019s convenience store sales rose by 7% over the quarter as it opened nine new outlets, while online sales were up by 8%.",

Customers\u2019 habits are changing, shopping habits are changing very rapidly, driven by the rise of digital. Customers demand more utility and more speed, and Argos gives us the ability to serve customers in an increasingly rapidly changing world,\u201d Coupe said.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s convenience store sales rose by 7% over the quarter as it opened nine new outlets, while online sales were up by 8%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wells Fargo executives will forfeit millions of dollars in the wake of revelations that the bank\u2019s sales quotas led to the creation of more than 2m unauthorized accounts. The bank\u2019s chief executive, John Stumpf, will forgo his salary for the coming months as independent directors launch a new investigation into Wells Fargo\u2019s retail banking and sales practices. Last year, Stumpf made about $19.3m. Stumpf will also forfeit unvested equity awards worth about $41m. Carrie Tolstedt, who oversaw retail banking at Wells Fargo while the unauthorized accounts were opened, was slated to receive as much as $124.6m after retiring this summer, according to Fortune. The bank said on Tuesday that she would not receive an undisclosed severance and would forfeit about $19m in unvested awards. Less than three weeks ago, Wells Fargo announced that it had agreed to pay $185m in penalties after an audit found that its employees opened as many as 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit card accounts without customers\u2019 consent. The accounts were opened by the bank\u2019s staff in hopes of meeting their monthly sales quota and earning their incentive bonuses. Wells Fargo workers have tried to draw attention to the \u201cunreasonable\u201d quotas before \u2013 some even staged a protest in front of the bank\u2019s headquarters last year. When Stumpf testified in front of the US Senate last week, he drew ire from US lawmakers. Many of them called for the bank to recoup pay from Stumpf and Tolstedt and hold them accountable. While the bank insists that the creation of unauthorized accounts was not part of an orchestrated effort, many lawmakers expressed doubt that thousands of employees acted on their own. Stumpf was scheduled to testify in front of the House financial services committee on Thursday. Many expected the hearing to be much of the same, including calls for clawing back the executives\u2019 pay. Wells Fargo pre-empted that by announcing the clawbacks on Tuesday. The board also reserved the right for further clawbacks pending the results of its investigation. \u201cBased on the results of the investigation, the independent members of the board will take such other actions as they collectively deem appropriate, which may include further compensation actions before any additional equity awards vest or bonus decisions are made early next year, clawbacks of compensation already paid out, and other employment-related actions,\u201d Stephen Sanger, lead independent director, said in the statement. The bank also announced that it is ending its practice of sales quotas three months earlier than previously stated. \u201cWhile we continue to determine the details for 2017 goals and incentive plans for the retail bank, we are taking steps to accelerate the removal of product sales goals effective 1 October 2016, and put greater emphasis on delivering the best customer experience,\u201d the bank said in a statement provided to CNBC. \u201cWe are also making adjustments to ensure that as we make changes, we maintain fair and consistent compensation for retail bank team members.\u201d This month, the bank announced that it planned to end its sales goals by January 2017. When Stumpf testified in front of the Senate last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told him that he demonstrated \u201cgutless leadership\u201d in blaming the unauthorized accounts on the 5,300 former employees. \u201cThis is about accountability,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should resign, you should give back the money you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. This just isn\u2019t right.\u201d Warren said that Wall Street executives were not held accountable in 2008 \u201cwhen they crushed the worldwide economy\u201d and were not being held accountable now, either. \u201cThe only way that Wall Street will change is if executives face jail time when they preside over massive frauds,\u201d Warren told Stumpf. \u201cUntil then it will be business as usual, and at giant banks like Wells Fargo, that seems to mean cheating as many customers, investors and employees as they possibly can.\u201d",
