    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco is bringing its nine-year solo venture in China to an end at a cost of up to \u00a31.5bn \u2013 making it the grocer's latest aggressive international expansion to unravel. The world's third largest supermarket is in negotiations with China's biggest retailer, state owned China Resources Enterprise, to create a joint venture where Tesco's 131 stores in the country would merge with CRE's 2,986 sites under the Vanguard brand. Tesco is expected to pay millions in fees for the deal, which will leave it with a 20% stake, however, it means the Tesco name is likely to disappear from the country all together following integration. Both sides are understood to have been in talks since before Tesco's full year results in April where chief executive Philip Clarke said the company would take a \"more cautious\" approach towards China. Three years ago, in his previous role as head of international, Clarke had unveiled plans to open 80 vast shopping malls, all including a tesco hypermarket, across China that would have made its retail portfolio bigger than the UK. However, following the disastrous withdrawal from its ill-fated US Fresh &amp; Easy venture which cost \u00a31.8bn, Clarke has refocused his attentions on the UK and reining back excessive spending on expansions. It is not known how much Tesco has spent on its Chinese venture so far, however, former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy revealed in 2010 that the company planned to spend \u00a32bn in the country by the end of 2015. In its most recent quarterly trading update the company revealed that like for like sales in China had fallen 4.9% and that sales fell in every international location except Malaysia and Hungary. The memorandum of understanding with CRE is unlikely to see any deal completed until next year, but if successful it would create a business with annual sales of \u00a310bn. Analysts generally welcomed the move, saying Tesco was unlikely to become a serious national contender without investing billions of pounds more into the country. Mike Tattersall, retail analyst at UBS, said: \"It's a pretty sensible transaction all round. Tesco has a sub-scale business in China. To achieve scale and profitability they would need to spend a lot of money, billions more. \"That does not fit with the current strategy of the group which is all about cash generation and fiscal responsibility. \"In the development of a market like China consolidation is a natural progression. It's not the embarrassing retreat that happened in the US. They got the business where they wanted it to be without spending lots of money.\" The entrenchment is the latest by Tesco this year, after it pulled out of the US and Japan, although it has had some success in the far east, with South Korea and Thailand both performing well. The plans for a US sale continues, but so far no buyer has emerged and there are now suggestions that the only viable option may be to shut down the operation. According to Tesco's website, China still remains \"strategically important\". The grocer opened 12 new hypermarkets last year, and is due to launch an online groceries business in Shanghai later this year. However, Tesco has struggled to win over Chinese customers. Last year sales dropped 1%. Other British retailers have also struggled in China in recent years. B&amp;Q attempted a solo expansion into China in 1999 which was initially successful, but eventually led to the company cutting half its number of stores after years of losses. Marks &amp; Spencer, which has stores in Shanghai, had a disastrous initial launch after the company shunned local knowledge and hoped to copy the same model as its Hong Kong stores. The business is now improving. Tattersall explained the difficulties with expanding into China: He said: \"The problem with China is how attractive it is. It's so big and it's long term pot is so large that all the international retailers are looking at the same metrics. All the lights go green and they all pile in at the same time. Everyone is throwing capital at it so you have more and more competitors at the same time. Like-for-like growth is very difficult to come by and gross margins are tough. \"Inflation is high so from a food retailer's perspective, you have to pay a lot in wages, which is going up at double digit rates too.\" Retail adventures in China B&amp;Q The UK's biggest DIY chain headed for China in 1999, opening its first store in Shanghai. The business made a profit for a couple of years, but performance slowed after the Chinese government introduced measures to cool the housing market after the infamous ghost towns started popping up. B&amp;Q did not help itself by over-expanding in the early 2000s at a time when western businesses were keen to get into China at any cost. In 2009, parent company Kingfisher's new boss Ian Cheshire announced a repositioning of the China business as losses mounted to \u00a350m. Store numbers were cut from 63 to 40 and a further 17 were downsized. Since then the company has seen a modest recovery in China and in its most recent results B&amp;Q China saw a 10.7% like for like sales boost. Marks &amp; Spencer M&amp;S launched its first wholly owned China store in 2008 \u2013 it generally favouring joint ventures or franchises in other territories. However, the store opening on the West Nanjing Road, Shanghai, did not go well, with a business model based on its Hong Kong store failing to transfer successfully to the Chinese mainland. To make matters worse, a customer fell from the escalators and died, putting a so-called curse on the store and causing shoppers to steer clear. A year later chairman Sir Stuart Rose admitted the company \"screwed up\" after supply chain problems left the food hall virtually empty. He also said they must return to \"basic shopkeeping\" after not stocking enough smaller sizes. Bosses eventually fixed the problems and there are now 15 stores in the Shanghai region, 15 in Hong Kong and an online offer. Metro The German hypermarket giant entered China with a fanfare two years ago, opening 12 stores last year and vowing to have 100 by 2016. An online business-to-business store was also launched last year along with electronics stores Media Markt. However, earlier this year the company was forced to pull out of the Media Markt stores after it was constantly beaten by cheaper and better ranges online. Chief executive, Olaf Koch, said at the time: \"In order to keep Metro Group on target for success, it is essential for us to concentrate on those business units and markets where we can clearly sharpen our profile and build up a strong market position.\" The company said its Metro Cash &amp; Carry self-service wholesale business would continue. Best Buy The American electronic giant opened in China in 2006 with a majority stake in Nanjing-based retailer Five Star, spending $180m, but the operation struggled from the beginning. During the US recession management focused on the struggling US market and took its eye off China, leaving to underinvestment. The retailer's own-brand stores never adapted to the local market or succeeded in wooing the Chinese customer. In 2011 it shut its own brand big box stores to focus exclusively on the Five Star brand, but it has lost market share. Analysts are now calling on Best Buy to move on, after it also failed and quit in Europe.",

    "webTitle": "Hotel prices could fall after OFT investigation into comparison sites", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hotel room prices could fall across the board in the UK following an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading. The probe into the world's two biggest reservation services, Booking.com and Expedia.com, and IHG Group, which controls the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and InterContinental chains, centred on allegations that the major booking sites were insisting on 'rate parity' from hotel chains, which prevented competitive discounting of room rates. Complainants also alleged that the sites prevented rival reservation services from undercutting them. The OFT probed allegations that IHG had made separate agreements with both Booking.com and Expedia to restrict other reservation sites from offering discounts. In a damning verdict on the two giant reservation sites \u2013 Booking.com alone reserves nearly 3m hotel rooms every week \u2013 the OFT suggested that real competition was limited. Booking.com and Expedia have now agreed with the OFT to \"relax existing restrictions\" so that rival agents can provide discounts on the room rates. OFT senior director Ann Pope, who has led a team at the regulator in a two-year probe into the booking sites, said: \"The OFT is consulting on whether these commitments offer an immediate and effective means of injecting some meaningful price competition into the online offering of room-only hotel accommodation bookings where, in our provisional view, none may exist.\" But the threat of multimillion pound fines and penalties against the Expedia and Booking.com has been lifted, with the OFT saying it will close the investigation if the sites accept and abide by the commitments. The OFT said that it focused on Booking.com, Expedia and IHG in the hope of achieving a swift outcome, but said it was concerned that practices were \"potentially widespread\" across the industry. Under the proposed new commitments, online rivals to Booking.com and Expedia will be free to use their commission revenue or margin to offer lower prices. The reservation sites obtain commission from hotels for every room they book, which can be as high as 25% of the price paid by the traveller. The expectation now is that as rival online sites accept a lower commission, margins will be slimmed and prices fall. The OFT investigation was prompted by a formal complaint from a small Brighton-based online travel agent, Skoosh.com, which accepted lower commission rates to undercut other providers. But Dorian Harris, founder of the site, said he was deeply frustrated by the OFT announcement, which he said represented only a partial victory for consumers. \"What this announcement means in practice is that we will be able to discount room prices, but we won't be able to tell the public about it. The site will just be able to say there is a discount available\" The new guidelines are likely to result in an explosion of loyalty schemes on booking sites which will offer prices somewhere between current advertised rates and those available on 'top secret' sites where the buyer only finds the name of the hotel after booking. One hotel chain spokesman said: \"The new rules will probably mean that you will have to register on a booking site and give evidence that you are a UK resident. When you search for a hotel, you will then be able to access a discount, but only for hotels in the EU. But it will be hotel by hotel; and there will be no guarantee of a discount.\" Harris said his business started to be squeezed three years ago by big US hotel chains insisting they were removed from his site because his prices were below that of competitors. \"The hotels told me they were being put under huge pressure by the big hotel booking websites to ensure what's called 'rate parity'.\" Unless he raised his prices, he would be prevented from offering the rooms. He said his firm was also forced off one of the major price comparison sites. \"They asked us to leave, which was a major blow for us as it was 70% of our business.\" Among the evidence that Harris pointed to was job advertising for Booking.com, in which the company sought to hire a \"rate parity associate\" in which \"you are part of a team that is responsible for finding and solving any rate inconsistencies between Booking.com and their competitors\". The person was expected to \"solve rate parity issues\" if they arise. Harris said the OFT announcement confirmed that Booking.com and Expedia were engaged in practices \"that they were always, or initially, denying. But this is not a ruling, this is them making a commitment while the investigation is in progress. \"In my view the big online agents have given the OFT the runaround. The hotel booking industry is controlled by very few players, with Booking.com now dominant in Europe, while in the US it has bought the comparison site Kayak [through its parent group, Priceline.com]. And Expedia have taken over comparison site Trivago.com.\" The OFT said it was opening a consultation on the commitments, but said that if the booking sites accepted them, it would close the case. At the start of the investigation there was speculation that the major reservation sites could face multimillion pound fines, but the OFT added that if the commitments were adhered to, there would be no financial penalties. An IHG spokeswoman said: \"IHG notes this morning's announcement from the OFT regarding its investigation into the online supply of room only hotel accommodation by online travel agents. The OFT has today commenced a public consultation on a series of commitments designed to bring an end to this investigation without finding of infringement or the imposition of any fine. IHG has worked closely with the OFT to agree these commitments, which are now subject to a consultation period ending 13 September 2013.\" An Expedia spokeswoman said: \"Expedia welcomes these commitments which will enable the OFT to close its investigation without taking any action and to permit Expedia to focus on its long-standing commitment of driving global demand for its partners by providing the best online travel experience.\"",

Booking.com and Expedia have now agreed with the OFT to \"relax existing restrictions\" so that rival agents can provide discounts on the room rates.</p> <p>OFT senior director Ann Pope, who has led a team at the regulator in a two-year probe into the booking sites, said: \"The OFT is consulting on whether these commitments offer an immediate and effective means of injecting some meaningful price competition into the online offering of room-only hotel accommodation bookings where, in our provisional view, none may exist.\"</p> <p>But the threat of multimillion pound fines and penalties against the Expedia and Booking.com has been lifted, with the OFT saying it will close the investigation if the sites accept and abide by the commitments.</p> <p>The OFT said that it focused on Booking.com, Expedia and IHG in the hope of achieving a swift outcome, but said it was concerned that practices were \"potentially widespread\" across the industry. Under the proposed new commitments, online rivals to Booking.com and Expedia will be free to use their commission revenue or margin to offer lower prices.</p> <p>The reservation sites obtain commission from hotels for every room they book, which can be as high as 25% of the price paid by the traveller. The expectation now is that as rival online sites accept a lower commission, margins will be slimmed and prices fall.</p> <p>The OFT investigation was prompted by a formal complaint from a small Brighton-based online travel agent, Skoosh.com, which accepted lower commission rates to undercut other providers.</p> <p>But Dorian Harris, founder of the site, said he was deeply frustrated by the OFT announcement, which he said represented only a partial victory for consumers.</p> <p>\"What this announcement means in practice is that we will be able to discount room prices, but we won't be able to tell the public about it. The site will just be able to say there is a discount available\"</p> <p>The new guidelines are likely to result in an explosion of loyalty schemes on booking sites which will offer prices somewhere between current advertised rates and those available on 'top secret' sites where the buyer only finds the name of the hotel after booking.</p> <p>One hotel chain spokesman said: \"The new rules will probably mean that you will have to register on a booking site and give evidence that you are a UK resident. When you search for a hotel, you will then be able to access a discount, but only for hotels in the EU. But it will be hotel by hotel; and there will be no guarantee of a discount.\"</p> <p>Harris said his business started to be squeezed three years ago by big US hotel chains insisting they were removed from his site because his prices were below that of competitors.</p> <p>\"The hotels told me they were being put under huge pressure by the big hotel booking websites to ensure what's called 'rate parity'.\" Unless he raised his prices, he would be prevented from offering the rooms. He said his firm was also forced off one of the major price comparison sites. \"They asked us to leave, which was a major blow for us as it was 70% of our business.\"</p> <p>Among the evidence that Harris pointed to was job advertising for Booking.com, in which the company sought to hire a \"rate parity associate\" in which \"you are part of a team that is responsible for finding and solving any rate inconsistencies between Booking.com and their competitors\". The person was expected to \"solve rate parity issues\" if they arise.</p> <p>Harris said the OFT announcement confirmed that Booking.com and Expedia were engaged in practices \"that they were always, or initially, denying. But this is not a ruling, this is them making a commitment while the investigation is in progress.</p> <p>\"In my view the big online agents have given the OFT the runaround. The hotel booking industry is controlled by very few players, with Booking.com now dominant in Europe, while in the US it has bought the comparison site Kayak [through its parent group, Priceline.com]. And Expedia have taken over comparison site Trivago.com.\"</p> <p>The OFT said it was opening a consultation on the commitments, but said that if the booking sites accepted them, it would close the case. At the start of the investigation there was speculation that the major reservation sites could face multimillion pound fines, but the OFT added that if the commitments were adhered to, there would be no financial penalties.</p> <p>An IHG spokeswoman said: \"IHG notes this morning's announcement from the OFT regarding its investigation into the online supply of room only hotel accommodation by online travel agents. The OFT has today commenced a public consultation on a series of commitments designed to bring an end to this investigation without finding of infringement or the imposition of any fine. IHG has worked closely with the OFT to agree these commitments, which are now subject to a consultation period ending 13 September 2013.\"</p> <p>An Expedia spokeswoman said: \"Expedia welcomes these commitments which will enable the OFT to close its investigation without taking any action and to permit Expedia to focus on its long-standing commitment of driving global demand for its partners by providing the best online travel experience.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's trade deficit narrowed in June, helped by a jump in art exports after big sales of impressionist and contemporary art at London's top auction houses. Art exports jumped from \u00a3335m to \u00a3645m between May and June in the wake of the London sales. Auction house Sothebys sold a Barbara Hepworth scultpure, a Ben Nicholson oil painting of St Ives harbour and several paintings by Wassily Kandinsky as part of a \u00a3246m haul. Rival Christie's generated more than \u00a3160m from its impressionist and contemporary art sales. Among its successes was Grand Vase aux Femmes Voiles, a Picasso ceramic, which went on the market with an estimated price of \u00a3250,000-\u00a3350,000 but achieved \u00a3980,275, a world auction record for a ceramic by the artist. It also sold a Kandinsky - Studie zu Improvisation 3 - for \u00a313,501,875. The new trade data is the latest in a run of strong economic figures that show the UK economy recovering at its fastest rate since 2010. The near-doubling of art exports, together with a rise in aircraft sales, were pinpointed by the Office for National Statistics as playing a large part in the narrowing of the trade gap. Exports of goods in the second quarter of 2013 reached \u00a378.4bn, the highest on record, spurred by a jump in sales to the US and China. Sothebys said it benefited from a rise in sales to Asia, though it was difficult to know the final destination of pictures bought by dealers. Trade with France and the Netherlands also improved in June, reducing the overall deficit in goods and services to \u00a31.5bn from \u00a32.6bn in May. Official figures released on Friday also showed a rebound in construction activity in the second quarter of this year, adding to the recent optimism surrounding the UK's economic prospects. The services sector has been growing since the middle of last year and manufacturing output rose 1.9% quarter-on-quarter in June, with all parts of the sector \u2013 spanning carmakers to food-manufacturers \u2013 increasing their monthly output for the first time in more than 20 years. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the trade data was \"encouraging for hopes that growth is not only strengthening but becoming more broadly based\". He added: \"The hope is that a competitive pound and gradually improving global growth increasingly supports exports.\" Rachel Pettigrew, senior economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: \"This positive trade data supports our view that the manufacturing sector will gain momentum and will be a source of growth for the UK economy over the coming years.\" But Martin Beck, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, raised doubts that there was a significant rebalancing towards exports. \"Growing signs of a consumer-led recovery, and the increased import demand that implies, means that the trade deficit will probably still struggle to narrow further over the coming months,\" he said. The long-run picture of the UK's export performance is still one of a decline in the balance of trade in goods which dates back to the late 1990s and was blamed by many economists on a high pound. The pound has fallen in value by a quarter since 2008. Trade figures in recent months have arrested the decline but still leave an \u00a38.1bn gap between the value of imports and exports of goods. That gap is narrowed by an estimated \u00a36.5bn surplus in the value of services traded. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Our trade deficit is still too large and we aren't making enough progress in rebalancing our economy towards net exports. \"Our recent surveys reveal huge untapped potential among British exporters, especially in the service sector, and unleashing this potential will help to secure a sustainable recovery.\" Construction data from the ONS showed a 1.4% rise in activity in the three months to the end of June. However, growing optimism that a fourth recession in the industry is coming to an end was dampened by a more detailed examination of the figures that showed all the boost to output was in April, while between May and June output fell 0.7%. The industry is 0.5% smaller than a year ago and has contracted by 9.4% since the first quarter of 2011, a period marked by a 1.5% rise in GDP. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 August 2013. An earlier version referred to sales by Sotheby's between May and June as part of a \u00a3127m haul. That should have been \u00a3246m and has been corrected.",

And yet there is one sector of Spanish business that is predicated on shame. It is the <em>cobrador del frac</em> (the frock-coated debt collector), a peculiarly Spanish institution that is booming as thousands of businesses go to the wall.</p> <p>It is a simple and powerful device. If you see a man dressed in a black frock coat and top hat, carrying a black brief case standing outside an office, a house or next to someone's table in a restaurant, you know that person has not paid their debts. In effect, they are being named and shamed.</p> <p>\"The figure of the cobrador is so well known he doesn't have to say anything,\" says Juan Lorca, manager of the Barcelona office of the Cobrador del Frac, a company that has branches all over Spain and Portugal and which has been chasing debtors for the past 25 years.</p> <p>\"All they have to do is stand there. They never speak to the subject. They never do more than hand the debtor our card.\"</p> <p>Business has risen by some 40% over the past five years as more and more Spanish companies go to the wall. \"We're one of the few Spanish companies where business is booming,\" Lorca says. He says the idea originated in Ecuador where a group of business people decided to shame their creditors into paying by having them pursued by a man dressed as a chicken.</p> <p>As well as the frock coat, other debt-collecting agencies employ actors to dress up as monks, bears and bullfighters. Each carries a black briefcase with \"debt collector\" printed on it in large letters, lest anyone be in any doubt.</p> <p>Lorca says almost all their clients are businesses owed money by other businesses. The debts involved begin at \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3861) and there is a special department that deals with debts in excess of \u20ac100,000. \"We do have clients who are owed millions, and this is becoming more frequent,\" he says. They work either for a fixed fee or for a percentage of the debt recovered. He claims an 80% success rate.</p> <p>The industry is barely regulated and their methods can border on harassment.</p> <p>Aware of these criticisms, Lorca is quick to point out that they only pursue \"people who are able to pay but refuse to pay. We don't pursue people who have no money, but people who may have concealed their money in fake companies for example.\"</p> <p>He says this is one reason why people come to him rather than pursue their creditors through the courts. \"The legal system isn't designed to deal with these labyrinths through which people transfer their capital to another company,\" Lorca says. \"The law will pursue one company and its management, but if it sets up shop next door under another name, the law can't do anything.\"</p> <p>Sending in the cobrador is a last resort, he says. \"To begin with it's like any other negotiation. You meet and you try to come to an arrangement. But if all that fails, then we send out the man in the frock coat. These are people who have consistently refused to pay and only give in when subjected to unusual methods.</p> <p>\"Even for the most shameless people there will be some situation where they don't want the cobrador to appear. So we send him where it will do the most harm, usually his place of work, especially on the day when his suppliers or clients or financiers are visiting him. This usually encourages him to pay up.\"</p>",

In effect, they are being named and shamed. \"The figure of the cobrador is so well known he doesn't have to say anything,\" says Juan Lorca, manager of the Barcelona office of the Cobrador del Frac, a company that has branches all over Spain and Portugal and which has been chasing debtors for the past 25 years. \"All they have to do is stand there. They never speak to the subject. They never do more than hand the debtor our card.\" Business has risen by some 40% over the past five years as more and more Spanish companies go to the wall. \"We're one of the few Spanish companies where business is booming,\" Lorca says. He says the idea originated in Ecuador where a group of business people decided to shame their creditors into paying by having them pursued by a man dressed as a chicken. As well as the frock coat, other debt-collecting agencies employ actors to dress up as monks, bears and bullfighters. Each carries a black briefcase with \"debt collector\" printed on it in large letters, lest anyone be in any doubt. Lorca says almost all their clients are businesses owed money by other businesses. The debts involved begin at \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3861) and there is a special department that deals with debts in excess of \u20ac100,000. \"We do have clients who are owed millions, and this is becoming more frequent,\" he says. They work either for a fixed fee or for a percentage of the debt recovered. He claims an 80% success rate. The industry is barely regulated and their methods can border on harassment. Aware of these criticisms, Lorca is quick to point out that they only pursue \"people who are able to pay but refuse to pay. We don't pursue people who have no money, but people who may have concealed their money in fake companies for example.\" He says this is one reason why people come to him rather than pursue their creditors through the courts. \"The legal system isn't designed to deal with these labyrinths through which people transfer their capital to another company,\" Lorca says. \"The law will pursue one company and its management, but if it sets up shop next door under another name, the law can't do anything.\" Sending in the cobrador is a last resort, he says. \"To begin with it's like any other negotiation. You meet and you try to come to an arrangement. But if all that fails, then we send out the man in the frock coat. These are people who have consistently refused to pay and only give in when subjected to unusual methods. \"Even for the most shameless people there will be some situation where they don't want the cobrador to appear. So we send him where it will do the most harm, usually his place of work, especially on the day when his suppliers or clients or financiers are visiting him. This usually encourages him to pay up.\"",

This meant that the overall trade deficit narrowed modestly to \u00a35.9 billion in the second quarter from \u00a36.1 billion in the first. Total exports were up 2.5% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter while imports rose by 2.2% quarter-on-quarter</p> <p>Overall exports and imports were limited in June by a marked drop in oil exports and imports. It is notable that exports of manufactured goods excluding oil jumped 6.8% month-on-month in June which points to stronger foreign demand for UK goods. Overall goods exports to non-EU countries spiked up by 10.4% in June but they slipped back by 0.6% to EU countries.</p> <p>It therefore looks like net trade made a positive contribution to UK GDP growth of 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Export volumes of traded goods excluding oil and erratic rose by a very decent 5.9% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter while imports rose by 3.3% quarter-on-quarter. However, this was partly offset by the fact that there was a reduced surplus on services trade in the second quarter.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the hope is that a competitive pound and gradually improving global growth increasingly supports exports. It would be particularly helpful for the UK if Eurozone economic activity can at least stabilize and hopefully even start growing modestly, and there are mounting signs that this may finally be happening.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-09T09:25:25.020Z\">at 10.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5204afc5e4b07f555e6377ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-09T09:00:54.877Z\">10.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK is building again</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Not to be overlooked, the Office for National Statistics has also reported that <a href=\"http://ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/construction/output-in-the-construction-industry/june-and-q2-2013/stb-construction-output-june-and-q2-2013.html\">the construction sector grew in the second quarter of the year.</a></p> <p>Construction output was 1.4% higher in Q2 2013 than the year before, on one seasonally-adjusted measure.</p> <p>This was not enough building to have an impact on the GDP figures, but economists are sounding optimistic.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-09T09:01:01.897Z\">at 10.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5204aac8e4b070a50db488d9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-09T08:39:36.581Z\">9.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK trade gap narrows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK trade deficit <em>narrowed</em> in June to \u00a38.01 bn, a fall of around \u00a30.6 bn on month before, the Office for National Statistics has said.</p> <p>The agency said the change was in the normal range of trade fluctuations.</p> <p>Exports of goods rose \u00a326.9 bn in June, helping the trade deficit to reach its lowest level in nearly a year.

But that doesn't mean all is rosy in the world's second largest economy, as economist Robin Bew points out. In Europe, the UK reported that the trade deficit had narrowed (1.20) prompting excitable talk about re-balancing in action, as well as scepticism about whether export-driven growth was really happening. France posted some poor data on industrial production (8.44), while the German government was sounding optimistic about its growth record (10.38). Italy's lower house voted through a stimulus package (2.33) - helpfully averting political crisis in the process, while Cyprus (on Thursday) set out plans to end capital controls (1.58) that were introduced during the March financial crisis. That's all from me. Thank you for commenting and following, and have a good weekend. US markets have continued the week's downward trend, with modest falls on opening. This was in line with traders' expectations amid continuing doubts about the unwinding of the Federal Reserve's stimulus programme. Dow Jones -0.01% S&amp;P 500 -0.14% Between Monday - Thursday, the Dow Jones has lost 1% of its value and the S&amp;P 0.7% - putting them on track for their worst week since June. No summer political crisis in Italy, after the lower house of parliament voted for a growth package aimed at pulling the country out of recession. A quick recap: when former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was handed a tax fraud conviction last week, it threw the fate of Italy's three-month coalition into doubt, putting huge strain on relations between prime minister Enrico Letta's centre left and Berlusconi's centre-right supporters. Letta appealed for both sides to avoid political crisis and today - the last day before the summer recess - the Chamber of Deputies approved his economic action plan by 319 votes to 110. Letta's \"action decree\" frees up funding to upgrade the rail network, repair the roads and develop renewable energy. The Italian economy has shrunk for 8 successive quarters in a row. Crisis over? Parliament reconvenes in September. One of the few trades that is booming in Spain is debt collection. Stephen Burgen, a Guardian correspondent in Spain, has written about the \"peculiarly Spanish institution\" of the cobrador del frac, the frock-coated debt collector that seeks to shame debtors. It is a simple and powerful device. If you see a man dressed in a black frock coat and top hat, carrying a black brief case standing outside an office, a house or next to someone's table in a restaurant, you know that person has not paid their debts. In effect, they are being named and shamed. \"The figure of the cobrador is so well known he doesn't have to say anything,\" says Juan Lorca, manager of the Barcelona office of the Cobrador del Frac, a company that has branches all over Spain and Portugal and which has been chasing debtors for the past 25 years. \"All they have to do is stand there. They never speak to the subject. They never do more than hand the debtor our card.\" Read the full piece here: Send for the cobrador: business booms for Spanish debt collectors Cyprus has set out a plan to lift capital controls that were imposed in March to protect the the island nation from a run on its banks. The finance ministry published a roadmap on Thursday that it had cooked up with international lenders \u201cfor the gradual and prudent relaxation\u201d of the measures. As the Cyprus Mail reports, although restrictions have been eased since Cyprus secured its \u20ac10 billion bailout in March, there are still limits on cash withdrawals, cheque transactions and on large cash movements. \"Gradual and prudent\" evidently means no hasty promises on dates. Here is a key line from the ministry's statement: The Cypriot authorities are committed in removing the restrictive measures and ensuring free movement of capital, as soon as conditions allow. According to the EUobserver, experience from other parts of the world shows that such measures can be difficult to remove. Iceland has not yet lifted capital controls imposed in 2008 after the collapse of its financial system. It is a lot less lively than Beppe Gillo's interview (see 12.55), but worth a look at what the Italian economy minister Fabrizio Saccomanni had to say to the Wall Street Journal. Sounding optimistic - as eurozone finance ministers often do - Saccomanni told the paper that Italy could start growing in the last quarter of this year, after eight successive quarters of decline, It isn't a rate of growth that brings us back to pre-crisis levels...but there are a number of indications\u2014from tax payments to surveys of business confidence\u2014that are improving. But he acknowledged political instability could blow the economy off course. If we go to early elections without any more progress on these reforms, this will be very damaging. The Guardian's economics correspondent Phillip Inman has a piece on today's UK trade figure, which includes a useful round-up of economists' reactions. They give pretty mixed reviews on re-balancing. Rachel Pettigrew, senior economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF: This positive trade data supports our view that the manufacturing sector will gain momentum and will be a source of growth for the UK economy over the coming years. Martin Beck, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics: Growing signs of a consumer-led recovery, and the increased import demand that implies, means that the trade deficit will probably still struggle to narrow further over the coming months. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce: Our trade deficit is still too large and we aren't making enough progress in rebalancing our economy towards net exports. Our recent surveys reveal huge untapped potential among British exporters, especially in the service sector, and unleashing this potential will help to secure a sustainable recovery. Here is the full story: UK trade deficit narrows as exports surge to highest on record Bloomberg Businessweek has a fun interview with Beppe Grillo, leader of Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement. The comedian-turned-politician dodges a question about whether he would vote to leave the euro, but says debt is now a bigger problem than the currency. Where did Italy go wrong? It was the Italians. But at what point did Italy take a wrong turn? The drastic point was the accord between the mafia and the state. Are you talking about the Cosa Nostra, the old Sicilian families? Or something more general? I\u2019m talking about a financial mafia. A different mafia, on the boards of companies. You\u2019ve said that you want a referendum on the euro, to do an information campaign, and then let Italians decide. I\u2019m beyond the euro. The euro is no longer a problem. We\u2019re already outside the euro. Our problem isn\u2019t the euro. The real problem is the debt. Why do the referendum? The referendum, because we want our monetary sovereignty. If we printed money now, there\u2019d be a bit more inflation but we\u2019d be competitive with all the countries in the world. Would you vote to stay in or get out? Europe is one thing. The euro is something else. Of the 28 EU countries, there are 11 that aren\u2019t in the euro. They aren\u2019t at risk of default. The Greeks could have been saved. They don\u2019t care that the Greeks are dying in a corner. Just like they don\u2019t care about us. An interesting snippet of data from the Office for National Statistics' economic review out today. Real Household disposable income per head fell by 1% between 2006 and 2012. Spotted by Duncan Weldon at the TUC Mats Persson of Open Europe has an timely piece on his Telegraph blog about what British exit from the EU could mean for the dominant services sector. As he reminds us, the UK is a net exporter of services to the rest of the EU, in contrast to the deficit in goods. This strength could make it tricky for the UK to negotiate a good deal if it left the EU he reckons, leaving \"the UK vulnerable to tit-for-tat trade games in its key economic sector\" It follows that while Germany and others would have an interest in maintaining open markets for selling manufactured goods in the UK, this logic does not apply for services, where they are net importers from the UK.... Perhaps Germany would be so keen to continue selling tariff-free cars that it would happily offer market access for UK services firms as part of a new deal. However, it\u2019s far easier to remove tariffs for goods than it is to eliminate the myriad of barriers that exist to market access in services. And for those eurosceptics who think the UK could be a big Switzerland, he writes: Despite 40 years of negotiations, the Swiss still have patchy EU market access for services, while the EU and US have spent decades trying but failing to agree reciprocal market access for certain types of funds. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras has set two conditions for Greece to return to the bond markets - growth and a budget surplus excluding interest payments. Straight off the wires, this is what he told Greek TV: I have set two conditions for Greece to access (bond) markets. The first is a primary surplus and the second one is a return to growth. He also said that the eurozone needed a banking union - \"an economic policy which combines fiscal consolidation and growth\". Brazil has called for the International Monetary Fund's aid programme to be reviewed, in the latest sign of unease about bailouts for Europe's crisis-hit periphery. Guido Mantega, Brazil's finance minister, told the Financial Times that rescue programmes for the southern eurozone needed to be \"revised and improved\". This comes after Brazil's IMF representative Paulo Nogueira Batista abstained in a vote to release the latest tranche of cash for Greece, although Brazil later said they supported the Greek bailout. Mantega told the FT (metred paywall) that he and and Nogueira Batista both took the view that the rescue programmes for Greece and other countries of the periphery of the euro area need to be revised and improved so as to provide better chances of recovery for these countries. As Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo, a professor at Columbia University, told the paper: I think there\u2019s a broad dissatisfaction with the Greek programme everywhere except in Europe. Over to Washington, where President Barack Obama has given a message of support to Greece, at a meeting with prime minister Antonis Samaras on Thursday. As Ekathimerini reported, Obama also issued the US's now familiar warning against too much austerity in Europe: in dealing with the challenges that Greece faces, we cannot simply look to austerity as a strategy...It's important that we have a plan for fiscal consolidation to manage the debt, but it's also important that growth and jobs are a focus. Warm words, but does it amount to anything - when much of the eurozone's business is suspended until the German elections are over. For his part, Samaras told the Washington Post that Greece now \"looked good\" compared to its neighbours. The Post reckoned he was joking. If I had come here a year ago, you would have seen Greece being unstable around an area of stability. Now we look good compared to the region. You can see the two leaders in action at a press conference here Germany's economy is likely to have expanded significantly between April and June, the economy ministry has said this morning in its monthly report. The German economy grew briskly in the spring... After the weather dampened growth in the first quarter, there was a growth spurt in the second quarter due to catch-up effects. But it warned that growth would slow down at the end of the year, dampened by tough conditions in Europe and the international economy. Via Reuters I got overexcited about the trade data and read the figures back to front - so the 9.39 post has now corrected. From those who read the numbers correctly... The R word - rebalancing - is in the air, as economists digest the UK trade and construction data. Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, writes that the trade numbers are encouraging for hopes that growth is not only strengthening but becoming more broadly based. The total trade deficit narrowed to \u00a31.5 billion in June from \u00a32.4 billion in May as export growth of 3.2% month-on-month markedly out-stripped import growth of 0.6%. This meant that the overall trade deficit narrowed modestly to \u00a35.9 billion in the second quarter from \u00a36.1 billion in the first. Total exports were up 2.5% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter while imports rose by 2.2% quarter-on-quarter Overall exports and imports were limited in June by a marked drop in oil exports and imports. It is notable that exports of manufactured goods excluding oil jumped 6.8% month-on-month in June which points to stronger foreign demand for UK goods. Overall goods exports to non-EU countries spiked up by 10.4% in June but they slipped back by 0.6% to EU countries. It therefore looks like net trade made a positive contribution to UK GDP growth of 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Export volumes of traded goods excluding oil and erratic rose by a very decent 5.9% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter while imports rose by 3.3% quarter-on-quarter. However, this was partly offset by the fact that there was a reduced surplus on services trade in the second quarter. Looking ahead, the hope is that a competitive pound and gradually improving global growth increasingly supports exports. It would be particularly helpful for the UK if Eurozone economic activity can at least stabilize and hopefully even start growing modestly, and there are mounting signs that this may finally be happening. Not to be overlooked, the Office for National Statistics has also reported that the construction sector grew in the second quarter of the year. Construction output was 1.4% higher in Q2 2013 than the year before, on one seasonally-adjusted measure. This was not enough building to have an impact on the GDP figures, but economists are sounding optimistic. The UK trade deficit narrowed in June to \u00a38.01 bn, a fall of around \u00a30.6 bn on month before, the Office for National Statistics has said. The agency said the change was in the normal range of trade fluctuations. Exports of goods rose \u00a326.9 bn in June, helping the trade deficit to reach its lowest level in nearly a year. At the same time, imports also went up, by \u00a30.7 bn to \u00a335.0 bn. The trade deficit in goods and services was estimated to have been \u00a31.5 bn in June, compared with \u00a32.6 bn in May. You can see the ONS statistics here. ***Corrected at 10.25 More on those German trade figures, which show a surplus of \u20ac16.9 billion in June 2013. Germany is still forecast to grow faster than any other economy in the eurozone. The federal statistics office has provided a full breakdown here. 9.19 update - to avoid confusion - this German data was published on Thursday. German exports have disappointed, rising by 0.6% in June, well below the 1% increase many economists had pencilled in. Meanwhile, imports fell by 0.8% in May, raising doubts about the strength of domestic demand. Germany might be doing better than France, but is that good enough. Europe's largest economy has become a cause for concern, after it only narrowly escaped a recession in the first quarter of the year. Alexander Koch at UniCredit told Reuters: Exports were a bit of a drag on overall economic growth, but exports are likely to rise more strongly in the second half of the year because euro zone countries such as Italy and Spain will have stabilised. The slower export growth was quite likely more than compensated for by the strong manufacturing output in the second quarter, robust consumption and the springtime pick up in construction. 9.19 update - to avoid confusion - this German data was published on Thursday. Not a good start to the weekend for French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, as industrial output dropped 1.4% in June, compared to May. Blog heading fixed - thanks MacNara for pointing out the problem. More upbeat news from China, as official data shows that industrial output rose 9.7% in July, well above expectations. Economists have been sceptical about whether China would miss the government\u2019s 7.5% growth target for 2013, but expectations are rising that it is back on track for steady growth over the rest of the year. But Michelle Gibley at Charles Schwab investment services has warned that China\u2019s economy still faces very serious challenges. China\u2019s slowdown may be moderating but we believe there is too much excess capacity in China. China\u2019s economic model of the past, of debt-fueled investment-led, isn\u2019t working and needs to change. Until the excesses are reduced, economic growth won\u2019t be healthy. We believe China-related investments will underperform until there is more certainty about how and where China\u2019s economy stabilises. Quotes from Market Watch As expected European stocks have reacted positively to signs of recovery in China. FTSE +0.4% CAC 40 +0.13% DAX 30 +0.2% Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. China\u2019s inflation held steady in June in another sign that the world\u2019s second-largest economy is stabilising. Consumer price inflation rose 2.7% from a year earlier, well below the 3.5% target set by the Chinese government. This data follows Thursday\u2019s better-than-expected trade figures that revealed strong demand for Chinese exports. In Europe we are expecting UK construction and trade figures, and French manufacturing and industrial production data. I\u2019ll be following all the data and the latest developments...",

It seems reasonable to interpret the \"disasters of Europe\" as including Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain (PIGS), and it is also useful to provide a comparison with other OECD countries. Since 2007, the increase in gross debt as a percentage of GDP for Australia has been substantially less than for the PIGS. You get a similar picture when you look at net public debt. When the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP is used, both Ireland and Spain have experienced significantly larger increases in this variable than Australia. However, for Portugal the increase in the deficit to GDP ratio is of a similar magnitude to the increase for Australia, while Greece has actually experienced a decline. This evidence for the latter two countries is therefore not inconsistent with the opposition leader's claim.
