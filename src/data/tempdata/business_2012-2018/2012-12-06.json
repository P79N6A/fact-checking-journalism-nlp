      "bodyText": "Hector Sants, the former chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, is in talks to join embattled Barclays in a senior role barely six months after the leaving the City regulator. His six months' gardening leave will have ended by the start of January, and Sants made clear when he left the FSA in June \u2013 just days before Barclays was hit with a record \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor \u2013 that he was hoping to secure another senior role. Sants is also being linked to other positions, including at the accountancy firm Deloitte, although as he was a banker before he joined the FSA in 2004 he may be more likely to be persuaded to join Barclays, which was thrown into turmoil by the Libor allegations. The chairman, Marcus Agius, the chief executive, Bob Diamond, and the newly promoted chief operating officer, Jerry del Missier, all quit in the wake of the regulatory reports, which showed traders offering bottles of Bollinger for fixing submissions to the Libor panel. If Sants is appointed to a role at Barclays \u2013 most likely involving regulatory and compliance areas \u2013 it could prove controversial, because he was drawn into the Libor scandal and was at the helm of the regulator when Diamond was appointed chief executive of the bank two years ago. Sir David Walker, also a former regulator, has already been parachuted in as chairman to replace Agius, while the head of the retail banking arm, Antony Jenkins, was promoted to chief executive and immediately began the process of attempting to bolster morale at the bank and improve its public image. Sants is not thought to be in discussions about taking a seat in the boardroom but would be a senior figure inside the bank, which is also being investigated by the FSA for the disclosures it made at the time it secured funding from Middle Eastern investors during 2008, which helped it avoid a taxpayer bailout. Even though he left the FSA before the bank was hit with the Libor fine, Sants has since given his version of events at a series of hearings by the Treasury select committee. In September Sants wrote to the committee to make clear that the regulator knew about the Libor investigation when it approved Diamond's promotion to chief executive \u2013 and \"reserved the right to reassess [his] suitability in the light of the conclusions reached by investigation\". Sants is also said to have told Barclays that \"the relationship with [Diamond] had not reached the level of openness, transparency and willingness to air issues\" that the regulator had had with his predecessor. He could not be reached for comment, while Barclays would not comment on the suggestion that talks were being held, following a story that was first aired by Sky News. Sants's surprise departure from the FSA was announced in March and came ahead of the breakup of the regulator, with some of its operations going to the Bank of England and others to a new consumer regulator. The potential recruitment of Sants was mooted as Barclays completed a restructuring of its African operations by increasing its stake in its existing South African subsidiary Absa to 62% from 55% and bolt on some of its existing operations throughout the continent. Absa is effectively paying \u00a31.3bn to Barclays, through issuing shares, to take on much of the British bank's African operations, thereby creating a larger business spanning countries such as Botswana, Tanzania and Zambia. Ian Gordon, a bank analyst at Investec, said: \"Confirmation of the structure and pricing for its long-awaited African consolidation ticks all the boxes.\" Jenkins has adopted a strategy of developing Barclays into the go-to bank for customers, and used the slogan when announcing the African deal. The bank said the transaction with Absa \"is an important step in realising the shared goal to become the go-to bank in Africa, and is significant in aligning the integrated operating model across sub-Saharan Africa\".",

    "webTitle": "UK trade gap widens in October", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's ability to recover from the financial crisis took another knock after official figures showed the trade gap widened in October. Only a day after the chancellor, George Osborne, was forced to accept that the economy would grow more slowly than previously thought, the Office for National Statistics said the trade deficit in goods and services jumped to \u00a33.6bn from \u00a32.5bn in the previous month. The figures are likely to fuel fears the UK could suffer a triple dip recession, coming in higher than the \u00a33bn economists were expecting and providing strong evidence exporters are failing to win orders abroad. The trade gap for goods, including cars and other manufactured goods, reached \u00a39.5bn, offset by an estimated surplus of \u00a35.9bn on services. Alan Clarke, chief economist at Scotia Bank, said the deteriorating state of the economy meant \"there is a fighting chance that 'Triple Dip' headlines will retake the front pages of the newspapers from Will &amp; Kate.\" Poor economic figures from the eurozone, where French unemployment rose 0.1 percentage points to 10.3% and the European Central Bank downgraded its growth forecasts for the 17 member currency zone, added to the gloom. According to the ONS, the trade gap in goods is averaging \u00a38.9bn a month this year, higher than the \u00a38.5bn a month last year. The widening gap in October, driven by a 1% fall in exports and 2.5% rise in imports, supports the widespread view that the UK economy will struggle to regain momentum over the next two years. Exports to the eurozone were among the worst hit . Osborne will be especially concerned about his attempts to rebalance the economy towards exports after the figures showed the deficit in goods in the three months to October widened to \u00a328bn, its highest level since records began. The Office for Budget Responsibility's assessment of the UK economy found that a collapse in net trade was one of the chief reasons for a downgrade of growth over the next four years. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the trade figures did little to dispel the sense of torpor surrounding the UK economy. \"In its forecast published yesterday, the OBR expects net trade to provide some modest support to the economy over the next few years,\" he said. \"But in the near-term, with the eurozone economy in recession and recent survey indicators suggesting mixed prospects for UK exporters, we don't think that the economic recovery can rely on the export sector.\" A small rise in house prices during the last three months and a boost to car sales failed to dent the gloomy outlook. The Halifax said property values rose 1% in November on the previous month, though that left them 1.3% lower than last year. Car sales jumped 11.4% year on year in November, but most economists agreed it was an isolated example of consumer spending. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the trade figures would be a further drag on the economy after weak manufacturing, construction and services surveys in recent weeks. \"The October data though suggest that net trade is likely to be negative in the fourth quarter and weigh down on UK GDP. Furthermore, the latest survey evidence on foreign orders is soft overall. Certainly, it is hard to be optimistic that net trade can help the UK economy much in the near term at least given the pressure on exports coming from ongoing very weak domestic demand in the eurozone and generally soft global growth,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Cineworld has snapped up the arthouse cinema chain Picturehouse, owner of the Ritzy cinema in south London and the Phoenix in Oxford, in a deal worth \u00a347.3m. The deal \u2013 which will make Picturehouse's co-founder Lyn Goleby a multimillionaire \u2013 unites two very different cinema chains, with Picturehouse's films catering for an older, more highbrow audience while Cineworld's mass-market multiplexes tend to attract 18- to 24-year-olds interested in the latest 3D blockbusters. Cinemagoers at the Clapham Picture House, south London, on Thursday night did not welcome the news. Rachel Smith, who lives locally and takes her children to the cinema, feared it would become less independent. \"I think it's awful,\" she said. \"Cineworld is big and faceless and cold. The Ritzy and the Picture House are not like that at all. The staff have really good film knowledge and are warm and personable.\" Another filmgoer, Rupert Jermyn, said: \"Cineworld is not local, it does not have a good vibe. The Ritzy and Picture House are local cinemas. If they take the informal vibe from the picture house and inject it into Cineworld it would make it retro and cool and less like a supermarket.\" The multiplex giant, which runs 80 cinemas nationwide, stressed nothing would change at Picturehouse under the new ownership. It pledged to run Picturehouse as a separate entity, with all 750 staff staying on. Goleby will also remain as managing director with the rest of the Picturehouse management team, including its programming director, Clare Binns, a key figure in the UK film industry who worked her way up from an usher at the Brixton Ritzy, south London. But Cineworld's financial clout will enable the indie chain, Britain's biggest independent, to open 10 cinemas from 2014. The news coincided with the opening of Picturehouse's 21st cinema, The Duke's at the Komedia cabaret venue in Brighton. Cineworld's finance chief, Philip Bowcock, said: \"We're not coming in as a big corporate giant saying 'you're going to do xyz'. We're going to keep the quirkiness. It's a very different customer set \u2013 a little bit older, more discerning, more experienced. To lose that would be to lose the raison d'\u00eatre of Picturehouse.\" The deal includes the distribution arm Picturehouse Entertainment, which launched in 2010 with the \u00a3200,000 grossing My Afternoons With Margueritte and the bittersweet comedy Liberal Arts, which was released recently. Goleby, who founded the Picturehouse chain with Tony Jones with the opening of the Phoenix in Oxford in 1989, is expected to pick up a multimillion-pound windfall as one of the main shareholders in the parent group, City Screen. Jones is retiring from Picturehouse but is working on the Cambridge film festival, which Picturehouse runs. The other shareholders are Albion Ventures, a venture capital firm, which said it made a capital gain of \u00a36.5m from the \u00a312.5m sale of its share, and Arts Alliance. Goleby has known the Cineworld boss, Stephen Wiener, for a long time. He said: \"We recognise Picturehouse is valued by its customers and we look forward to supporting the business through the next phase of its development.\" The UK cinema market is now dominated by three players \u2013 Odeon &amp; UCI, Vue and Cineworld \u2013 which control 70% between them. Private equity-owned Vue bought a rival, Apollo, for \u00a320m in May while the financier Guy Hands bought Odeon and UCI in 2004 and merged them to create Britain's biggest operator. Picturehouse had sales of \u00a330.3m last year and a pretax profit of \u00a32.5m. Bowcock believes the acquisition will create value for Cineworld shareholders. \"It's profitable, there is demand for it. The population is getting older and people are spending more money on leisure time.\" Cineworld will be able to tap into Picturehouse's purchasing power and vice versa. \"For example, Lyn [Goleby] buys alcohol cheaper than we do,\" said Bowcock. Cineworld, which employs 4,000 people, has raised \u00a316m by issuing new shares to fund the deal, and Goleby has put \u00a31m of her money into the share placing. City analysts said the move made sense for Cineworld. Investec analyst Steve Liechti said: \"This looks an interesting move into the high value, older demographic, individual/arthouse cinema market and adds a new growth segment. We believe Cineworld can add material value to Picturehouse given its balance sheet strength and buying power.\"",

We believe Cineworld can add material value to Picturehouse given its balance sheet strength and buying power.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Financial advisers who specialise in devising complex tax-break schemes for investors have been accused of being part of an \"utterly immoral\" industry by a committee of MPs. Up to 100 boutique tax advice firms were \"running rings\" around Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs, members of the public accounts committee said. Officials who were supposed to be clamping down on tax avoidance were told by MPs that their department was in chaos, allowing the easy exploitation of the public pound. The hearing in parliament took place on Thursday as tax avoidance and tax management becomes an increasingly politically charged issue. George Osborne announced a \u00a377m boost for HMRC inspectors investigating suspected tax scams in the autumn statement on Wednesday, while Starbucks has caved into pressure and said it will pay \u00a310m in corporation tax in each of the next two years. In sometimes angry exchanges, the committee's chair, Margaret Hodge, said tax schemes were being used for a purpose not intended by the government. \"There are a lot of ordinary people who are being scammed,\" she said. The public would consider such schemes \"completely and utterly and totally immoral\" and those involved in devising and marketing them were \"running rings around\" tax officials, she said. The National Audit Office (NAO) has found that HMRC has taken only 11 tax avoidance schemes to court, despite hundreds of them arising over the last four years. Under the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes legislation (Dotas), any new scheme had to be reported to HMRC, which then issued that scheme with a number. Tax advisers then had up to two weeks in which to attract investment and make money before the scheme was eventually declared illegal and shut down, the committee heard. Since Dotas was introduced in 2004, the tax authorities have initiated dozens of changes to tax law. At least 100 such schemes have sprung up over the past few years, NAO says. Aiden James, director of Tax Trade Advisors, a firm that markets tax avoidance schemes to clients, told the committee that \"tax law is very complex and tax planning is a grey area\". Firms such as his looked for loopholes in tax law to gain an advantage for their clients, he said. He claimed that every scheme his firm promoted had been cleared by HMRC, but admitted that all of them had since been declared illegal and shut down. Tim Levy, the director of Future Capital Partners, a firm specialising in film investment schemes, admitted that more than half of the firm's 255 investments had been investigated by HMRC. One scheme, called Terra Nova, was shut down in 2007.

After the autumn statement revised down growth and revised up the budget deficit for the next five years, one of the ratings agencies \u2013 Fitch \u2013 has already served notice that it will be taking a hard look at the UK's debt dynamics over the coming months. It would be surprising if Moody's or S&amp;P were any more sanguine, and with the chances of a debt downgrade rising the chancellor \u2013 who has made a fetish of triple A status \u2013 is getting his retaliation in first. It might not happen of course. The UK has been a AAA country since it was first rated in the late 1970s and has survived the winter of discontent and Black Wednesday without losing its top-notch status. But as economists from HSBC have noted, the only country rated AAA by Moody's with a higher debt-to-GDP ratio than the UK is America. And the US has already been downgraded by S&amp;P. What's more, recent developments have not exactly been designed to engender confidence among the rating agency fraternity. Britain is probably only a couple of heavy blizzards away from a triple-dip recession this winter and the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility suggest that the economy will be 3.6% smaller in 2016-17 than it expected at the time of the 2012 budget in March. Higher budget deficits mean the cumulative borrowing overshoot from Osborne's original plans now tops \u00a3200bn. The UK doesn't feel like a AAA rated country. But the fact that the number of AAA rated countries is dwindling means that the economic impact of a downgrade would not be that great. Bond yields in the US and France did not go through the roof when they were downgraded and there is no reason to expect them to soar in the UK either. In the new world of skint sovereign states, double A is the new triple A. The chancellor clearly thinks so, which is why he declined to burden the economy with extra austerity in the next couple of years in order to meet his target of reducing the debt/GDP ratio by 2015-16. He was right to do so. Britain could survive a debt downgrade. Whether Osborne could is another matter.",

      "bodyText": "The ability of big companies to use armies of lawyers to prevent regulators from introducing consumer-friendly measures will be curbed after the chancellor's autumn statement promised to make appeals quicker and easier. Legal action and threats of litigation against the media and telecoms watchdog Ofcom in particular have held up the auction the new 4G mobile spectrum, overthrown a long battle to force BSkyB to share its sports and films programming with other channels, and delayed cuts to the cost of calling a mobile phone. The government on Wednesday promised three new measures, designed to \"minimise the burden of economic regulation\", including reviewing the appeals processes to make challenges to decisions by watchdogs \"quicker and easier\". There will also be incentives to encourage watchdogs to intervene more readily where markets are failing to deliver for consumers, and there will be greater transparency on their fees. It is understood the government wants the appeals process to change so spurious challenges can be rapidly weeded out and genuine complaints dealt with more quickly. The changes, which will be set out in detail in spring by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, apply to all economic regulators including Ofgem for electricity and gas, Ofwat for water and sewerage, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Office of Rail Regulation. Ofcom has been particularly vocal about the need for change. Its chief executive Ed Richards said earlier this year that the UK system was \"too legalistic and too open to gaming\" by companies able to pay for large legal teams, and that \"everything we do now is subject to the huge shadow of threat of litigation.\" An Ofcom spokesperson said on Wednesday: \"Ofcom welcomes the Government's plans to reform the appeals process. A quicker and more focused appeal process will help us to regulate the communications market more effectively, to the benefit of UK consumers and businesses.\" The first major auction of UK airwaves since 2000 will take place in January next year, but was originally scheduled for July 2008. A combination of a change of government and legal threats from mobile operators repeatedly delayed the process. Ofcom's battle to loosen Sky's grip on film and sports broadcasting, which had seen the issue pass to the Competition Appeal Tribunal and eventually the Competition Commission, took five years and ended in a defeat for the regulator. The latest round of cuts to the cost of calling a mobile was blocked for 14 months by legal challenges from network operators before being approved on appeal earlier this year. And a move to allow consumers to transfer their mobile number from one network to another in a matter of hours rather than days has been held up since 2007, following a 2008 legal challenge by Vodafone. A spokesman for Three, the UK's smallest mobile network, said: \"We welcome the proposal to focus regulators on promoting competition. Ofcom has a clear duty to promote the interests of consumers through competition, but too often it is frustrated by petty legal challenges.\"",

She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Under azure skies thousands of young protesters have taken to the streets to denounce the 'state violence' increasingly exerted by police in the three years that the debt-choked country has endured its economic crisis. In both Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s northern metropolis, demonstrations have descended into violence with police reporting scores of arrests. Hooded protesters hurled rocks and slabs of marble at rows of riot police lined up outside the Greek parliament in Syntagma Sqaure. \u201cWe were forced to respond with teargas,\u201d said a police officer requesting anonymity.</p> <p>In Thessaloniki, where unemployment levels are especially high, youngsters added petrol bombs to the arsenal of projectiles lobbed at police. Many carried banners decrying police tactics and \u201cfascism in our schools\".</p> <p>\u201cWe see Alexis as a hero, a symbol of resistance,\u201d said Pavlos Triantafilopoulos participating in a protest rally outside parliament. \u201cThose pigs murdered him for no reason. What state kills young kids?\u201d asked the 15-year-old who regretted not being old enough to have taken part in the violence unleashed by the killing four years ago.</p> <p>Around 5,000 police have been deployed around Athens with boulevards closed throughout the city centre as authorities brace for more demonstrations set to begin at 5pm local time.</p> <p>\u201cWe expect there will be incidents, violence,\u201d said the officer.<br>The anniversary comes at a particularly sensitive time for young Greeks hit by austerity and, as reported earlier, record levels of joblessness.</p> <p>Tensions have been reflected at a political level where the youth wing of the main opposition radical left Syriza party have exhorted Greeks to use the occasion to revolt against the system.</p> <p>\u201cThe December 2008 uprising was the struggle for hope and justice in life,\u201d it said in a statement which was met with outrage from the conservative New Democracy party, the predominant force in Greece\u2019s tripartite governing coalition. \u201cSociety\u2019s outburst, with pupils at the fore, is the furious answer of an entire generation to a system of exploitation and violence.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And congratulations to Helena for winning the prestigious Botsis prize for journalism. The Botsis Foundation cited \u201cher excellent coverage of Greece's economic crisis and unstinting compassion with which she has conveyed the plight of ordinary Greeks to an international audience\u201d through the pages of the Guardian and Observer and, of course, this blog.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b3ea8935-5341-4746-9c31-0cb7f807adf5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/6/1354804538667/7bbac9a0-d404-46b5-bb56-23b4e0b198a0-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Thousands of high school students are taking part in the protests in Athens today.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thousands of students are taking part in the protests in Athens today.

And the same could be said of Mario Monti's non-party government.</p> <p>The PDL's move could be dismissed as a reprisal for a remark by the bill's sponsor, the economic development minister, Corrado Passera. In a clear reference to Berlusconi's hint that he was about to re-enter the race for prime minister, Passera said that \"turning back is not a good thing for Italy\".</p> <p>But it is worth stressing that the leader of Berlusconi's troops in the upper house did not say it was a one-off rap over the knuckles. Maurizio Gasparri said the PDL's move signalled \"the passage of our group to a position of abstention in relationship to the government\".</p> <p>If that is the case, then the Monti government has just lost its<br>majority in the upper house: La Repubblica calculated a few minutes ago that the government can only now count on 131 votes out of the 161 it needs.</p> <p>Monti is not doomed. But no one in and around the Italian parliament is going to need reminding that Silvio Berlusconi left office in November 2011 after he too lost the support of one \u2013 and only one \u2013 of the two chambers.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-06T12:46:47.934Z\">at 12.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50c0876395cbee15935f4700\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-06T11:54:11.174Z\">11.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Monti loses majority in senate</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The results are in from the Senate vote in Italy...

Our&#xa0;Southern Europe editor John Hooper writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the talk in Italy this morning is of a statement put out late last night by - I'm afraid so - Silvio Berlusconi, strongly implying he intends to return as the candidate for the right in the general<br>election that has to be held in Italy by the spring. He had a meeting yesterday with top officials of his Freedom People (PDL) movement. An agency dispatch said he had told them he was not going to run because no one wanted him to. His statement said: \"The reality is the opposite\". The website of his family's newspaper, Il Giornale, headlined its frontpage with \"Berlusconi returns to the field\".</p> <p>Certainly, Berlusconi's return would electrify politics in Italy, even though the PDL is currently getting only about 16% in the polls. But at least as significant as the billionaire TV magnate's intentions were the terms in which his statement was couched. Implicitly condemning the non-party government of Mario Monti, which took over from his in November 2011, he said: \"The situation today is a good deal more serious than a year ago.\" He spoke of a country \"on the brink of the abyss\": unemployment was up by a million; public debt had increased; Italians' disposable incomes had collapsed and taxation was<br>at \"intolerable levels\".</p> <p>There is inevitably speculation that Berlusconi might now try to bring down Monti's government before it completes its legislative programme (including some direly needed structural reforms) and that he will fight the next campaign on an anti-austerity, anti-Merkel platform. As Paul Krugman and any number of other economists will tell you, there are some pretty good arguments for a policy that puts growth before austerity. But Berlusconi is scarcely the man to implement such a policy. While he was in office, Italy's economy grew by less than<br>almost any other in the world.</p> <p>With Italian sovereign bond yields, relative to safe-haven Bunds, at their lowest for two years, it is clear the markets are dismissing the risk of renewed political instability in Italy. That would seem to be a remarkably complacent view.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ffbb7efe-ac4c-4c63-afb8-23c793b5b42e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/6/1354789890576/8b1ad420-cd40-4d0e-bb0d-a666b6be8150-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Silvio Berlusconi watches AC Milan vs Zenit St Petersburg at the Champions League on Tuesday.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silvio Berlusconi watches AC Milan vs Zenit St Petersburg at the Champions League on Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "One final thought on the situation in Italy: And with that it's time to shut up shop for the evening. Thanks for the comments and we'll be back again tomorrow, when we'll be looking at the latest developments in Italy and Greece, as well as the US non-farm payroll numbers. Good night. Italian president Mario Monti has said he is in contact with the country's president and is waiting to hear his judgement on the political situation, according to Reuters. Meanwhile our correspondent John Hooper says:: The drama continues. What is becoming clear is that Silvio Berlusconi risks splitting his party. The lower house of parliament is voting on another confidence motion, this time one that has been attached to a bill aimed at cutting the cost of Italy's many representative institutions. Franco Frattini, a former EU commissioner and foreign minister in Berlusconi's last government, has announced that he is rebelling. Others may follow. But the media mogul still has an adoring fan club. One of his (female) lawmakers, commenting on his statement last night, quoted from the Bible: \"Let there be light: and there was light\". To save her leader's blushes, no doubt, she omitted the first part of the sentence, which runs \"And God said ...\" More on the Greek protests as they head towards Parliament: It seems a shame not to have (the fake) Angela Merkel's take on the latest developments in Italy: A three step process to strengthen the European economic and monetary union has been drawn up and will be considered by EU leaders next week. The plan, overseen by European Council president Herman Van Rompuy, is the culmination of six months of drafting, said Reuters (full story here): The paper, put together with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and eurozone finance ministers, lays out the steps required to complete a banking union and proposes creating a stand-alone budget, financed by euro zone countries, that would be used to handle one-off shocks to their economies. [The] three-part process... involves creating a single supervisor for all the eurozone's banks, establishing a fund to wind down problem banks and fully coordinating national schemes that guarantee deposits. European markets have closed and despite a raft of seemingly bad news, they have managed to edge higher. Italy however is an exception, which is hardly a surprise given the political uncertainty caused by Silvio Berlusconi's party refusing to back prime minister Mario Monti. Among the disappointing news was a forecast from the European Central Bank that eurozone GDP would not resume growth until 2014. With the ECB also seeming to indicate it had considered further rate cuts, the euro dropped as low as $1.2963, its weakest since the end of November according to Reuters data. But hopes of a resolution to the US fiscal cliff provided some support. Here's a quick run through of the stock markets: \u2022 The FTSE 100 is up 9.34 points at 5901.42, a 0.16% increase \u2022 Germany's Dax has added 1.07% \u2022 France's Cac has climbed 0.31% \u2022 Spain's Ibex is up 0.35% \u2022 The Athens market is 1.59% better \u2022 But Italy's FTSE MIB is down 0.75% \u2022 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just 10 points The picture in Italy appears no clearer to judge by these reported developments: And this: Berlin has started to be called the Silicon Valley of Europe as tech start-ups proliferate in its suburbs. My colleague Nadine Schimroszik has a report on the capital's tech boom here. More on the situation in Italy, and the attempts to soothe fears are emerging. Italy's president Giorgio Napolitano has said there was no cause for alarm because of the current political tensions, while finance minister Vittorio Grilli said the country was not on the brink of a precipice and the government was committed to its reforms. Meanwhile analysts at Unicredit said the decision by Berlusconi's PDL party to withdraw support for prime minister Mario Monti was signifcant and promised a bumpy ride ahead. But they believe Monti will win this afternoon's confidence vote: Note that this is a confidence vote on the decree adopted by the government in October to improve the oversight of local finances and that it has been scheduled for quite some time. According to a PDL\u2019s official, the Berlusconi\u2019s party will abstain in the upcoming vote, but this should not prevent the government from winning the confidence vote. The next important test will be the vote on the Stability law in the Senate (it was already passed by the Lower House, but there is still no precise date for the vote in the Senate). We continue to think that the political parties which currently support the Monti government will guarantee the approval of the Stability Law. Still, the fact that the electoral campaign moves into top gear certainly increases the political uncertainty. The situation remains very fluid. The newly announced Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, looks like he will be right at home when he takes over from Mervyn King next summer. In its latest financial review the Bank of Canada, where Carney is currently governor, said high household debt and a heated housing market were the biggest domestic threats to the country's financial stability. It also rated the risk from the eurozone crisis as \"very high\". If the crisis worsened it could have a significant impact on the Canadian financial systems. The bank said the US fiscal cliff posed a major near term problem. All of these are familiar problems for the UK too, although Carney will have to deal with other issues too. For a start, Canada's banking system seems far more robust and has a better reputation than in the UK, while Canada also appears to be in no danger of losing its AAA credit rating. A couple more photos from today's demonstrations in Greece. Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party has decided to abstain in a confidence vote in the lower house later, according to Reuters. This follows a walkout by the centre-right party in this morning's senate vote, and looks like causing more problems for the government. It would mean this morning's move was not just a one off, and prime minister Mario Monti is faced with not having a parliamentary majority. That could prompt calls for an immediate election ahead of the planned vote in March. There may be other options. Food for thought from next week's Economist. What would happen if Britain left the EU? Answers on a postcard, or in the comments below. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank agrees: The somewhat downbeat ECB forecasts, the sombre tone of the ECB statement and Draghi\u2019s admission that the ECB had a \u201cwide discussion\u201d over many issues including a potential rate cut also keep the door open for a cut in early 2013. Some reaction to the ECB presser coming through. General feeling seems to be that the ECB will have to act next year, if it's predicting the recession will continue until 2014. Over to Greece again where our correspondent, Helena Smith, says protest marches marking the fourth anniversary of the shooting death of teenager Alexis Grigoropoulos have been underway \u2013 and not without incident. She writes: Under azure skies thousands of young protesters have taken to the streets to denounce the 'state violence' increasingly exerted by police in the three years that the debt-choked country has endured its economic crisis. In both Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s northern metropolis, demonstrations have descended into violence with police reporting scores of arrests. Hooded protesters hurled rocks and slabs of marble at rows of riot police lined up outside the Greek parliament in Syntagma Sqaure. \u201cWe were forced to respond with teargas,\u201d said a police officer requesting anonymity. In Thessaloniki, where unemployment levels are especially high, youngsters added petrol bombs to the arsenal of projectiles lobbed at police. Many carried banners decrying police tactics and \u201cfascism in our schools\". \u201cWe see Alexis as a hero, a symbol of resistance,\u201d said Pavlos Triantafilopoulos participating in a protest rally outside parliament. \u201cThose pigs murdered him for no reason. What state kills young kids?\u201d asked the 15-year-old who regretted not being old enough to have taken part in the violence unleashed by the killing four years ago. Around 5,000 police have been deployed around Athens with boulevards closed throughout the city centre as authorities brace for more demonstrations set to begin at 5pm local time. \u201cWe expect there will be incidents, violence,\u201d said the officer. The anniversary comes at a particularly sensitive time for young Greeks hit by austerity and, as reported earlier, record levels of joblessness. Tensions have been reflected at a political level where the youth wing of the main opposition radical left Syriza party have exhorted Greeks to use the occasion to revolt against the system. \u201cThe December 2008 uprising was the struggle for hope and justice in life,\u201d it said in a statement which was met with outrage from the conservative New Democracy party, the predominant force in Greece\u2019s tripartite governing coalition. \u201cSociety\u2019s outburst, with pupils at the fore, is the furious answer of an entire generation to a system of exploitation and violence.\u201d And congratulations to Helena for winning the prestigious Botsis prize for journalism. The Botsis Foundation cited \u201cher excellent coverage of Greece's economic crisis and unstinting compassion with which she has conveyed the plight of ordinary Greeks to an international audience\u201d through the pages of the Guardian and Observer and, of course, this blog. And with that it's over. One interesting off-mic remark from Draghi... Why are you suspicious about me being Italian? Couldn't hear the question that prompted it, I'm afraid. Lots of questions on outright monetary transactions (the bond-buying programme designed to help crisis-hit countries). Draghi gets fed up of repeating himself. We shall provide bullet points of what he said... Size of OMT would be adequate to achieve objectives The main aim of OMT is to overcome the fragmentation of the eurozone OMT terms do not refer to any interest rates Read the initial press release before asking any more questions Draghi: Some bond yields dropped 2% since July (when he made his pledge to do whatever necessary for euro), more than anything a rate cut could have done Great hilarity over Draghi's suggestion that the ECB does not tell governments what to do. Someone asks how long till the troika decides the \"killer medicine\" it has prescribed for Greece isn't working. Draghi: I wouldn't agree with the killer medicine. The ECB is the largest creditor to Greece. I acknowledge the very significant progress in undertaking fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Part of what is happening is a needed adjustment. Reminds everyone of the imbalances in eurozone before the crisis. Draghi says our LTROs have injected a significant amount of liquidity, this didn't reach the real economy to a large extent. He says demand factors are the main reason behind subdued credit growth. Conspiratorial question suggesting Goldman Sachs is funding the Group of 30, which happens to have a lot of ex-GS bankers on it, including Draghi. Draghi says there aren't any conflicts of interests and he isn't aware of GS funding the Group of 30. He says Greece has not squeezed private bondholders too much. My impression is that a lot has been asked of the public sector. This whole programme is being financed and being put forward by the public sector and public sector money. The debt buyback is part of this and it's too early to say how it's going. Draghi: The economic outlook is weak. We haven't seen any substantive change of our medium term assessment of price stability. Monetary conditions remain accomodative. Last (ever) question from FT Deutschland (which is closing down) gets a nervous laugh of acknowledgment by other journalists. He is \"very confident\" the eurozone will reach an agreement on banking supervision, says the benefits of a single supervisor are not disputed. Draghi says it is natural that different countries in the eurozone pay different levels of interest to borrow money. I haven't said that higher credit costs are unjustified, acutally different credit costs are quite natural but [within a range]. He says today's rate decision was by consensus. But the ECB did discuss the possibility of negative interest rates. We are operationally ready [for negative deposit rates]. Draghi is confident about next eurozone summit... This is going to be an important council because it will basically say that the commitments made in the June summit are maintained or are going to be maintained. I don't have such a poor expectation as you hinted at. I'm confident that the determination of the June summit will be confirmed at the oncoming summit. Questions... Is Italy precipitating into an abyss? This is a question markets are asking. What signal is necessary for markets to ensure Italy is going forward? Draghi: no comment. Draghi says a single supervisory mechanism for banks is a \"crucial move towards reintegrating the banking system\". Twice. It's that crucial. The ECB also downgrades the inflation forecast to 2.5% this year, 1.1% to 2.1% next year, and 0.6%-2.2% in 2014. ECB expects eurozone GDP to shrink by between 0.6% and 0.4% this year, and again next year by between 0.9% and 0.3%. Draghi only expects the region will get back to growth in 2014, of between 0.2% and 2.2%. Economic activity should gradually recover next year he says, aided by \"accomodative policy\". He says financial market confidence has \"visibly improved\". The ECB will continue with the main refinancing operations with full allotment for as long as necessary - (that's the cheap money for eurozone banks). He says the ECB kept rates on hold, owing to high energy prices, an increase in taxes in some countries, inflation rates have been elevated for some time. Recently they fell and are expected to fall below 2% next year. Inflation expectations remain aligned to target of staying below but close to 2%. Draghi's arrived to much excitement from the photographers, and wishes us a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, because we're not going to get together again until next year. While we wait... US jobless claims dropped for a third straight week last week, but analysts say they are still too volatile to give a clear signal on the health of the labour market. Claims dropped 25,000 to 370,000, bringing them back to levels seen before the superstorm Sandy. The four-week moving average, however rose by 2,250. Two minutes till the ECB press conference and the journalists are assembled. We'll be covering it in the blog and you can watch it here. Back to the Greece, where the protests continue. Bloomberg is running a story reminding people of the human crisis behind the figures we publish every day. Oliver Staley writes: Anastasia Karagaitanaki, 57, is a former model and cafe owner in Thessaloniki, Greece. After losing her business to the financial crisis, she now sleeps on a daybed next to the refrigerator in her mother\u2019s kitchen and depends on charity for food and insulin for her diabetes. \u201cI feel like my life has slipped through my hands,\u201d said Karagaitanaki, whose brother also shares the one-bedroom apartment. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m dead.\u201d Italian government bond yields continue to rise in response to the growing uncertainty over the future of the government. Tradeweb data shows the yield on the 10-year debt \u2013 effectively the interest rate \u2013 climbing to 4.57%. Spanish bond yields are rising in sympathy, up 10bp at 5.53%. Is Italy entering a new era of political instability (see 12.01pm)? Open Europe thinks so. The leader of Berlusconi's senators, Maurizio Gasparri, said ahead of the vote, \"Our attitude [today] signals...the shift of our group to a position of abstention towards the government.\" This seems to suggest that Berlusconi's party has withdrawn its support for Monti's government. If all of Berlusconi's senators and MPs show next time and abstain (which, by the way, cannot be taken for granted, given the internal divisions created by Il Cavaliere's latest hints to a comeback), Monti would be in danger of losing his majority - since the absents' votes do not count and bring the required majority down, as happened in the Italian Senate a couple of hours ago. The big question is: was today's an isolated incident or a definitive change of position? Gasparri's words seem to suggest the latter could be true. Should this be the case, Berlusconi could be about to trigger another round of political uncertainty Italy really doesn't need. And the European Central Bank has... left rates on hold at 0.75% and announced no new stimulus measures. As expected. ECB president Mario Draghi will be speaking in 45 minutes when he will probably downgrade forecasts for next year. No surprise there then... the Bank of England left rates on hold at 0.5% and left the \u00a3375bn ceiling for quantitative easing unchanged. Let's see if the ECB has a bit more to offer in its press conference at 1.30pm. Our Southern Europe editor John Hooper reports on the growing crisis in the Italian government. Just an hour or so ago, I was saying I thought the markets were underestimating the potential for instability in Italy. But I didn't expect to be proved right quite so swiftly. The absence (or abstention) of senators from Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom People (PDL) movement in the crucial vote this morning on the government's second economic stimulus package has not killed off the measure, nor \u2013 for the moment \u2013 the government. The bill went through by 127 to 17 with 23 abstentions. And there were enough lawmakers present to ensure a quorum. But the stimulus package (which has still to be approved in the lower house) is far from safe. And the same could be said of Mario Monti's non-party government. The PDL's move could be dismissed as a reprisal for a remark by the bill's sponsor, the economic development minister, Corrado Passera. In a clear reference to Berlusconi's hint that he was about to re-enter the race for prime minister, Passera said that \"turning back is not a good thing for Italy\". But it is worth stressing that the leader of Berlusconi's troops in the upper house did not say it was a one-off rap over the knuckles. Maurizio Gasparri said the PDL's move signalled \"the passage of our group to a position of abstention in relationship to the government\". If that is the case, then the Monti government has just lost its majority in the upper house: La Repubblica calculated a few minutes ago that the government can only now count on 131 votes out of the 161 it needs. Monti is not doomed. But no one in and around the Italian parliament is going to need reminding that Silvio Berlusconi left office in November 2011 after he too lost the support of one \u2013 and only one \u2013 of the two chambers. The results are in from the Senate vote in Italy... Prime Minister Mario Monti's austerity bill has survived the confidence vote, but Monti lost his majority, prompting speculation he may step down as early as today. Thanks to my colleague Heather Stewart who has sent through what may be the best ever pun in a eurozone-related piece of research, from the lovely people at Lombard Street Research. Bit long but it's worth a read (promise). Dario Perkins: 2-Pack and the notorious PIIGs \u201cEveryone\u2019s ashamed to the youth cause the truth looks strange/And for me it\u2019s reversed, we\u2019ve left them a world that\u2019s cursed, and it hurts\u2026/Don\u2019t let me get teary, the world looks dreary, when you wipe your eyes see it clearly.\u201d (2Pac Shakur) Full of regrets and facing an increasingly sinister reality, it is perhaps unsurprising that European policymakers are turning to America\u2019s greatest rap artist for solace. At least that was my reaction when I first discovered references to \u2018Two-Pack\u2019 in their banking union proposals. Unfortunately, it turns out their \u2018Two-Pack\u2019 is something far less glamorous \u2013 an \u2018enhanced form of macroeconomic surveillance\u2019 in the euro area. 2Pac famously started a war with another influential rapper; the Notorious B.I.G. Two-pack\u2019s main 'beef' is with the notorious P.I.I.Gs. The rap war led to the death of both rappers in the late 1990s. It\u2019s not clear the proposed banking union will fare any better. He goes on to explain why the Two-Pack system of banking supervision will not work. The ECB will host the banking union, but it won\u2019t be able to recapitalize banks simply by creating money \u2013 the Germans want a clear separation between financial and monetary policy. The euro crisis has changed but it isn\u2019t over. The politicians will eventually realize 2Pac was right, \u2018every time you come up, something happens to bring you back down\u2019. And the German factory data is in... and it looks pretty good. Manufacturing orders rose 3.9% in October compared with an expected rise of 1%. Foreign orders rose an impressive 6.7% on the month, driven by orders from non-eurozone countries. Domestic orders ticked up by just 0.4%. Meanwhile, in Rome, Berlusconi's party (PDL) has walked out of the Senate ahead of a confidence vote on prime minister Mario Monti's austerity bill. Reuters writes that the \"symbolic move\" does not threaten the government's survival but shows strong disapproval of Monti's administration from the largest party backing him. PDL senate leader Maurizio Gasparri said the party would not take part in the vote on Monti's latest package of reforms but would not vote against the decree or formally abstain, either of which would cause the government to fall. Markets are clearly nervous about suggestions that Berlusconi might be about to stage a comeback (see 10.35am), with yields rising on 10-year government bonds. Back to the Greek unemployment data briefly. Thinktank Open Europe notes that the target set by the troika of lenders \u2013 the EU, the IMF and ECB \u2013 for joblessness was 22.4% by the end of 2012. That is some way away from September's rate of 26%. Riot police are out in force in Greece for the protests marking the anniversary of the fatal shooting of a teenager by a police officer, according to reports on Twitter. Here's a story to keep you awake at night, Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is planning his return to mainstream politics. Our Southern Europe editor John Hooper writes: All the talk in Italy this morning is of a statement put out late last night by - I'm afraid so - Silvio Berlusconi, strongly implying he intends to return as the candidate for the right in the general election that has to be held in Italy by the spring. He had a meeting yesterday with top officials of his Freedom People (PDL) movement. An agency dispatch said he had told them he was not going to run because no one wanted him to. His statement said: \"The reality is the opposite\". The website of his family's newspaper, Il Giornale, headlined its frontpage with \"Berlusconi returns to the field\". Certainly, Berlusconi's return would electrify politics in Italy, even though the PDL is currently getting only about 16% in the polls. But at least as significant as the billionaire TV magnate's intentions were the terms in which his statement was couched. Implicitly condemning the non-party government of Mario Monti, which took over from his in November 2011, he said: \"The situation today is a good deal more serious than a year ago.\" He spoke of a country \"on the brink of the abyss\": unemployment was up by a million; public debt had increased; Italians' disposable incomes had collapsed and taxation was at \"intolerable levels\". There is inevitably speculation that Berlusconi might now try to bring down Monti's government before it completes its legislative programme (including some direly needed structural reforms) and that he will fight the next campaign on an anti-austerity, anti-Merkel platform. As Paul Krugman and any number of other economists will tell you, there are some pretty good arguments for a policy that puts growth before austerity. But Berlusconi is scarcely the man to implement such a policy. While he was in office, Italy's economy grew by less than almost any other in the world. With Italian sovereign bond yields, relative to safe-haven Bunds, at their lowest for two years, it is clear the markets are dismissing the risk of renewed political instability in Italy. That would seem to be a remarkably complacent view. And unemployment in Greece continues to soar, hitting a new record of 26% in September. Greece and Spain have been the worst hit in terms of unemployment. The jobless rate in Spain, which has slightly more timely data, rose to 26.2% in October, with more than half of its young people out of work. Both are running at more than double the eurozone average of 11.6% in September. But the currency bloc is still firmly in recession. Regional statistics agency Eurostat confirmed its estimate this morning that eurozone GDP fell by 0.1% in the third quarter, following a 0.2% fall in the second. The wider 27-state European Union fared a little better, with output rising 0.1% in the third quarter. Thanks to commenter ballymichael for flagging up the plight of billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, who told investors that the bulk of his losses this year came from bets that the European debt crisis would worsen. Svea Herbst-Bayliss of Reuters reports: Earlier in 2012 Paulson had expressed concern about Europe and tried to protect against a sovereign default. But he acknowledged that the facts have now changed. Europe's new central bank governor, Mario Draghi, showed a strong commitment to the region and to the common currency which hurt his initial thesis. As ballymichael notes: Yep. It's difficult to see, in the day-to-day hectic of yet-another-failed-summit, but they're actually making progress. And making guys like Paulson lose money? That's kind of nice too. Odds are shortening on the UK losing its triple-A rating by the end of the year. The miserable UK trade data (see below) suggests Chancellor George Osborne should not rely on exports to drive a recovery, say analysts at Capital Economics. They write: In its forecast published yesterday, the OBR expects net trade to provide some modest support to the economy over the next few years. But in the near-term, with the eurozone economy in recession and recent survey indicators suggesting mixed prospects for UK exporters, we don\u2019t think that the economic recovery can rely on the export sector. Sticking with the UK, the trade deficit widened dramatically in October as exports fell and the price of goods abroad dropped. The Office for National Statistics said the deficit grew to \u00a39.5bn in october, compared with analyst expectations of \u00a38.8bn. That echoes yesterday's analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility that a collapse in trade is the key explanation for the continued slump. The three-month trade deficit with EU rose to \u00a314.6bn, the worst on record, with exports to Italy and Spain down by more than 10% over the year. On a brighter note, they rose by more than 5% to the US and China. European shares are higher this morning, helped by gains at aerospace company EADS. UK FTSE 100: up 0.4%, or 23 points, at 5915 France CAC 40: up 0.7% Germany DAX: up 1% Spain IBEX: up 0.6% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.75% But it's too early to break out the champagne on UK house prices, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. While an impressive looking rise in itself, this has to be put in the context that house prices had fallen in each of the previous four months including a drop of 0.1% in October. The data reinforce our view that while significant downside risks remain to house prices, they are likely to be broadly flat over the coming months. Recent signs of modestly improving housing market activity and the likely increasing beneficial impact of the Funding for Lending Scheme on mortgage lending underpin our belief that house prices will broadly stabilise. However, we suspect that any significant, sustainable turnaround in house prices is still some way off. Back to the UK, where house prices rose by 1% last month, according to mortgage lender Halifax. That was much stronger than expected, with economists forecasting an increase of just 0.2%, but prices in the three months to November were 1.3% lower than a year ago. Halifax says prices are likely to remain broadly unchanged in 2013. Economist Martin Ellis said Bank of England measures to boost lending appeared to be working. There are signs that the Funding for Lending scheme (FLS) is helping to reduce mortgage rates and may be contributing to the recent pick-up in mortgage approvals. The FLS should help to ease credit constraints, resulting in some improvement in mortgage availability in 2013. Quick look ahead to the central bank meetings later today. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee meeting is likely to be uneventful. Analysts widely expect the bank rate to be left at 0.5%, while the level of quantitative easing will be left unchanged at \u00a3375bn. It's just the statement today, but we'll get more detail when the minutes are released in a couple of weeks. Barclays economists, Chris Crowe and Simon Hayes write: In our view, the November Inflation Report signalled that the MPC was broadly content with current policy settings, with inflation forecast to undershoot the 2% target at the policy-relevant horizon, but only marginally. MPC comments in the last few weeks have taken a slightly more dovish tone, and we view these comments as suggesting that the committee is ready to undertake further QE should the outlook for activity deteriorate. For the time being, though, we see little reason for the MPC to have changed tack. There should be some news out of the ECB press conference at 1.30pm, however. Although economists don't expect the bank to act on rates yet, ECB president Mario Draghi is likely to give some gloomy forecasts for next year, which could offer clues on the direction that policy will take. Phillip Shaw at Investec says the ECB is likely to have discussed a rate cut at this meeting, although he expects no change this month. In terms of the ECB's bond buying programme, he writes: We would expect the ECB President simply to reiterate that the ECB has a fully effective backstop mechanism in place, ready and waiting for when it is needed. Overall, we do not therefore expect any major new policy announcements at next week\u2019s meeting. Most significantly, we will watching for clues as to how close the GC got to sanctioning a further reduction in the main refi rate. Over to Greece, where there are likely to be protests as the country marks the fourth anniversary of the murder of teenager Alexis Grigoropoulos by a police officer. The fatal shooting in 2008 sparked a week of riots. Reports on Twitter suggest protests will begin at 11am. More on that later. It's a tale of two jobless queues this morning, with France posting an unemployment rate of 10.3%, while Switzerland's is running at just 3.1%. The French jobless rate ticked up 0.1% in the third quarter to its highest level since the third quarter of 1999, according to date from the national statistics agency INSEE. Young people, in particular, struggled to find work, with youth unemployment rising to 24.9%. Over in Switzerland, meanwhile, the jobless rate ticked up to just 3.1% in November from 2.9% in October. There's trouble brewing in Germany's biggest bank. The FT is running a story that Deutsche Bank failed to recognise up to $12bn of paper losses during the financial crisis, helping the bank avoid a government bailout, citing complaints by three former bank employees to US authorities. Tom Braithwaite, Kara Scannell and Michael Mackenzie write: The three complaints, made to regulators including the US Securities and Exchange Commission, claim that Deutsche misvalued a giant position in derivatives structures known as leveraged super senior trades, according to people familiar with the complaints. All three allege that if Deutsche had accounted properly for its positions \u2013 worth $130bn on a notional level \u2013 its capital would have fallen to dangerous levels during the financial crisis and it might have required a government bail-out to survive. It's not just the UK's credit rating under threat. Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's last night put Greece in 'selective default' after the country began to buy back debt at a big discount. The rating agency said in a statement: We lowered our sovereign credit ratings on Greece to 'selective default' following the Greek government's invitation [on December 3] to private sector bondholders to participate in a series of debt buyback auctions. In our opinion, Greece's invitation constitutes the launch of what we consider to be a distressed debt restructuring. As well as the central bank meetings, there is eurozone GDP data out later that will confirm the currency bloc is in recession. France unemployment data: 6.30am UK trade data for October: 9.30am Eurozone GDP for third quarter: 10am Germany factory orders for October: 11am Angela Merkel and Israeli PM hold press conference: 11am Bank of England MPC announcement: 12pm ECB announcement: 12.45pm ECB's Mario Draghi gives press conference: 1.30pm US jobless claims: 1.30pm Another Merkel press conference: 3.30pm In the debt markets, France is selling \u20ac3-\u20ac4bn of six to 15-year debt. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone debt crisis. We'll be mopping up the fall-out from the Autumn Statement yesterday, which has already prompted one of the rating agencies to warn on Britain's triple-A status. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank hold their monthly meetings today to discuss interest rates and any stimulus measures. While neither is expected to change policy, the ECB will update its forecasts, which are likely to present a grim outlook.",

      "bodyText": "Starbucks is volunteering to pay \u00a310m in taxes in each of the next two years as it attempts to win back customers following revelations that it has paid no corporation tax in the UK in the past three years. Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks UK, said he was surprised by the public outcry at the company's use of complex tax arrangements and vowed to make the payments to HM Revenue and Customs for two years even if the coffee chain failed to make a profit. However, politicians and tax experts said the unilateral decision, which Engskov said he had not discussed with HMRC, made a mockery of the tax system, while the tax authorities reaffirmed the position that corporation tax is not voluntary. The unprecedented announcement was made at the London Chamber of Commerce, where Engskov said: \"I am announcing changes which will results in Starbucks paying higher corporation tax in the UK \u2013 above what is currently required by law. \"Specifically, in 2013 and 2014 Starbucks will not claim tax deductions for royalties or payments related to our intercompany charges. \"In addition, we are making a commitment that we will propose to pay a significant amount of corporation tax during 2013 and 2014 regardless of whether our company is profitable during these years. \"These decisions are the right things for us to do. We've heard that loud and clear from our customers.\" Although he said the tax authorities were unaware of the company's plans, he added they had been in negotiations generally. Corporation tax is levied on profits but Starbucks has avoided paying it for three years in the UK through complex international payments within the company known as transfer pricing. Starbucks currently makes a loss due to a 4.7% premium paid to the Netherlands division \u2013 where the coffee beans are roasted, and another 20% premium to Switzerland to buy the coffee beans. The company said it would not claim deductions on these payments, or against intercompany loans. Chris Morgan, head of tax policy at KPMG, said: \"I think what they've said is absolutely extraordinary and really does change the tax landscape. It is the first time I have seen public opinion make a company change its mind. \"This is clearly a voluntary decision despite taxes being collected according to law and principles. HMRC might be very nervous about how things are done because their job is to collect the right amount of tax and they don't want to overcharge people.\" Conor Delaney, tax lawyer at Milestone International Tax Partners, said it \"made a mockery\" of the tax system. He said: \"You have a fundamental principle that you can only be taxed by clear legislation and yet you have this process where a company is hauled up and publicly embarrassed and blackmailed into volunteering more tax.\" Other multinationals including Google and Amazon have come under attack for their use of similar tax arrangements, which involve funnelling cash through European subsidiaries based where tax levels are lower. Last night, Google and Amazon declined to follow Starbucks' lead, insisting they pay the correct level of tax. The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: \"It really makes me sick to see Starbucks taking the credit for a voluntary decision to pay some tax just because consumer resistance and publicity has hit them where it hurts \u2013 in the pocket. \"When will HMRC get a proper grip of transfer pricing and royalty ruses that companies like Starbucks use to conceal their real profitability in this country?\" Conservative MP Steve Barclay, who sits on the public accounts committee, which grilled bosses from the three companies last month, said he was pleased with the decision. However, he warned: \"This payment is more to do with corporate reputation than corporation tax. \"Companies have a duty to shareholders to maximise their profits, so it is difficult for Starbucks to argue that they are making this payment on tax grounds, rather than to protect their brand identity.\" Engskov continued to insist that the company's business in the UK remained unprofitable despite contradictory statements by board members in investor presentations at the company's US headquarters. Starbucks UK would need to turn a profit of \u00a341.6m if it was to legitimately owe HMRC the \u00a310m corporation tax it plans to pay next year. However, it has made a loss for nearly every year it has traded in the UK, paying just \u00a38.6m in corporation tax over the 14 years it has been here due to challenges by HMRC. UK Uncut, which is encouraging direct action against the chain, was not appeased. Spokesperson Hannah Pearce said: \"The \u00a310m that Starbucks have estimated they may end up paying is \u00a35m less than that paid by their nearest competitor, Costa Coffee. \"This weekend 40 actions will take place in Starbucks stores in towns and cities across the country. People will be transforming Starbucks stores into refuges, creches and other services which the government are cutting with their unjust and unnecessary austerity plans,\" she said. HMRC declined to speak about individual companies' tax affair, but said: \"Corporation Tax is not a voluntary tax and Parliament sets out the rules and rates for businesses to follow. \"The public expects businesses to pay their fair share and HMRC will challenge, through the courts if necessary, any structures or tax payments that do not comply with the UK tax law.\" \u2022 This story was altered on 6 December 2012. The original gave the impression that Starbucks would pay \u00a310m in tax over two years - in fact, it will pay \u00a310m a year for two years.",

HMRC might be very nervous about how things are done because their job is to collect the right amount of tax and they don't want to overcharge people.\"</p> <p>Conor Delaney, tax lawyer at Milestone International Tax Partners, said it \"made a mockery\" of the tax system.</p> <p>He said: \"You have a fundamental principle that you can only be taxed by clear legislation and yet you have this process where a company is hauled up and publicly embarrassed and blackmailed into volunteering more tax.\"</p> <p>Other multinationals including Google and Amazon have come under attack for their use of similar tax arrangements, which involve funnelling cash through European subsidiaries based where tax levels are lower.</p> <p>Last night, Google and Amazon declined to follow Starbucks' lead, insisting they pay the correct level of tax.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: \"It really makes me sick to see Starbucks taking the credit for a voluntary decision to pay some tax just because consumer resistance and publicity has hit them where it hurts \u2013 in the pocket.</p> <p>\"When will HMRC get a proper grip of transfer pricing and royalty ruses that companies like Starbucks use to conceal their real profitability in this country?\"</p> <p>Conservative MP Steve Barclay, who sits on the public accounts committee, which grilled bosses from the three companies last month, said he was pleased with the decision.</p> <p>However, he warned: \"This payment is more to do with corporate reputation than corporation tax.</p> <p>\"Companies have a duty to shareholders to maximise their profits, so it is difficult for Starbucks to argue that they are making this payment on tax grounds, rather than to protect their brand identity.\"</p> <p>Engskov continued to insist that the company's business in the UK remained unprofitable despite contradictory statements by board members in investor presentations at the company's US headquarters.</p> <p>Starbucks UK would need to turn a profit of \u00a341.6m if it was to legitimately owe HMRC the \u00a310m corporation tax it plans to pay next year.</p> <p>However, it has made a loss for nearly every year it has traded in the UK, paying just \u00a38.6m in corporation tax over the 14 years it has been here due to challenges by HMRC.</p> <p>UK Uncut, which is encouraging direct action against the chain, was not appeased. Spokesperson Hannah Pearce said: \"The \u00a310m that Starbucks have estimated they may end up paying is \u00a35m less than that paid by their nearest competitor, Costa Coffee.</p> <p>\"This weekend 40 actions will take place in Starbucks stores in towns and cities across the country. People will be transforming Starbucks stores into refuges, creches and other services which the government are cutting with their unjust and unnecessary austerity plans,\" she said.</p> <p>HMRC declined to speak about individual companies' tax affair, but said: \"Corporation Tax is not a voluntary tax and Parliament sets out the rules and rates for businesses to follow.</p> <p>\"The public expects businesses to pay their fair share and HMRC will challenge, through the courts if necessary, any structures or tax payments that do not comply with the UK tax law.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This story was altered on 6 December 2012. The original gave the impression that Starbucks would pay \u00a310m in tax over two years - in fact, it will pay \u00a310m a year for two years.</p>",

Virgin had high hopes of extending its long tenure on west coast when bids were invited for a new 13-year franchise which was due to start on 9 December this year. But in August the DfT announced the new franchise had gone not to Virgin but to rival transport company FirstGroup. It was only after Branson, who had branded the bidding process \"insane\", mounted a legal challenge to the decision that McLoughlin scrapped the bidding process, saying there had been mistakes by the DfT. Three DfT officials were suspended and negotiations were started with a view to getting Virgin to run the line for between nine and 13 months before a short interim franchise was offered followed by a longer one later. Thursday's news means the government has altered its plans for the immediate future of the line, in that the Virgin temporary deal is for far longer and there will be no interim franchise before the long-term one is introduced. When he pulled the plug on the west coast franchise bidding, McLoughlin appointed businessman Sam Laidlaw to produce an independent report into the fiasco. After producing damning initial findings, which listed failings by the DfT, Laidlaw presented his full report to the department last week. But with one of the suspended department officials, Kate Mingay, mounting a legal challenge to her suspension, McLoughlin announced that he was delaying the Laidlaw report publication until this week, with publication likely later on Thursday. Laidlaw had been due to appear before the House of Commons transport committee this week, but MPs will now hear his evidence on 18 December. The committee's chairman, Louise Ellman, criticised the DfT over the delay and the RMT transport union has been upset that the department did not take the opportunity to take the west coast line into public ownership. On Wednesday, Martin Griffiths, the chief financial officer of Stagecoach, which owns 49% of Virgin Rail said: \"We are the operator of the service \u2013 the cancellation [of the franchise] was nothing to do with us.\" FirstGroup has not publicly ruled out legal action after the debacle that saw the government retract its award of the lucrative franchise up to 2026.
