He warned that the economic recovery was already \"shallow\".</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the European central bank president Mario Draghi warned that a protracted US shutdown <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/02/italian-prime-minister-faces-crunch-confidence-vote-live\">could impede economic recoveries around the world</a>. \"If it were to be protected, it is certainly a risk to the US and the world recovery, so we need to have it present in our minds,\" he said.</p> <p>Business Roundtable president John Engler said the shutdown and deficit row were already harming the economy. \"America's business leaders are extremely disappointed by the failure of the nation's political leaders to reach an agreement on funding the basic operations of the federal government,\" he said.</p> <p>The lobby group represents the CEOs of many of America's largest companies, including American Express, Boeing and Goldman Sachs.

      "bodyText": "President Obama met bank executives including Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein on Wednesday as economists, business leaders and European officials warned that the US government shutdown threatens to plunge the economy into a \"deep and dark recession\". The meeting with finance chiefs came as the shutdown entered its second day and Obama prepared to meet with Republican leaders in the hope of ending the impasse. Business leaders expressed concern about the shutdown, and about a looming battle over the nation's $16.7tn debt ceiling. Treasury secretary Jack Lew has warned that the US could default on its debts if the limit is not raised soon. \"There's precedent for a government shutdown; there is no precedent for a default,\" Blankfein told reporters after the meeting. He warned that the economic recovery was already \"shallow\". Earlier on Wednesday, the European central bank president Mario Draghi warned that a protracted US shutdown could impede economic recoveries around the world. \"If it were to be protected, it is certainly a risk to the US and the world recovery, so we need to have it present in our minds,\" he said. Business Roundtable president John Engler said the shutdown and deficit row were already harming the economy. \"America's business leaders are extremely disappointed by the failure of the nation's political leaders to reach an agreement on funding the basic operations of the federal government,\" he said. The lobby group represents the CEOs of many of America's largest companies, including American Express, Boeing and Goldman Sachs. Engler said the group had already warned Congress that even a brief shutdown would have serious economic consequences. \"At a time when both parties should be focused on job creation and policies to accelerate growth, their chronic disagreement and gridlock are actually undermining confidence, putting people out of work and hurting the economy,\" he said. The impact of the shutdown, now in its second day, is already being felt beyond government employees and frustrated tourists blocked from entering federal parks. The Internal Revenue Service has stopped issuing the W2 proof-of-income forms for some borrowers who need them to secure a loan. The Federal Housing Administration, which currently endorses about 15% of the entire single-family mortgage market, is operating with limited staff. Doug Lebda, the chief executive of mortgage company Lendingtree, said in a blogpost that the impact on the housing market would be minimal as long as a resolution was found soon. But it would worsen as a shutdown continued: \"The longest government shutdown lasted 21 days. Let's hope US lawmakers don't try to beat the record,\" he wrote. US stock markets fell Wednesday after a brief recovery Tuesday as investors bet that the shutdown was likely to continue. Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said the shutdown was likely to cause bigger losses for investors if it continued into next week. But he warned that would be nothing compared to the \"Pandora's box\" that would be opened if no deal on the debt ceiling was done before 17 October deadline.

The recession would be \"so dark that I can't imagine policymakers going down that route,\" he said. A stopgap solution was unlikely to reassure business or investors, he said. Moody's calculates that political uncertainty has cost the US economy 1m jobs since before the recession as businesses have delayed hiring for fear of changes in fiscal policy. Last year researchers at the San Francisco federal reserve that heightened policy uncertainty had become an increasing drag on job market since the recession began. The researchers concluded that recruitment wanes as uncertainty rises and that by the end of 2012, the unemployment rate would have been close to 6.5% instead of the reported 7.8% if not for the political infighting. \"For the sake of the US economy, Congress and the administration must sit down together and quickly find a solution to fund the federal government and avoid yet another perilous showdown over raising the debt ceiling,\" said Engler.",

    "webTitle": "David Cameron's Conservative conference speech: reality check", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Low business taxes Prime minister David Cameron branded Labour's business tax plans as crazy. He said: \"Last week, Labour proposed to put up corporation tax on our biggest and most successful employers. If those taxes are higher here than elsewhere, they don't come here. And if they don't come here, we don't get those jobs.\" Labour's plan is to scrap a proposed corporation tax cut in 2015 and redirect the money to small businesses. Before the last election George Osborne praised Ireland's 12% corporation tax rate. Labour had already cut the rate from 31% in 1997 to 28% by 2008. George Osborne has reduced it to 23% and it will fall to 20% next year. Innovation \"We've got to compete with California on innovation; Germany on high-end manufacturing; Asia on finance and technology,\" Cameron said. He said companies that innovate can locate anywhere. But his main lure is tax. Infrastructure \"With its wind and wave power, let's make the Humber the centre of clean energy,\" Cameron said. However, energy firm SSE has undermined the push for renewables by cancelling its entire tidal investment strategy. \"With its resources under the ground, let's make Blackpool the centre of Europe for the shale gas industry,\" he said. Blackpool suffered earthquakes off its coastline during fracking exploration last year, and like Balcombe in Sussex, residents are reluctant to go ahead. \"With its brains and research centres, let's make Manchester the world leader in advanced materials,\" he said. However, the much vaunted discovery of graphene - a wonder-material dubbed the new silicon - that has put Manchester on the map needs to be part of a wider investment in science that is constrained by Treasury cuts to publicly funded research and development. Sound management of the economy \"Let us never forget the cast-iron law of British politics,\" Cameron told delegates. \"It is Labour who wreck our economy and it's we Conservatives who clear it up,\" Cameron said, avoiding the records of Tory chancellors Reggie Maudling and then Anthony Barber, who landed their Labour successors with messy public finances in the 1960s and 70s. The case against Gordon Brown's stewardship of the economy prior to the financial crash is well rehearsed, but two of his predecessors are credited with leaving the economy in a much better shape than the one they inherited: Sir Stafford Cripps in 1951 and Roy Jenkins in 1970.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Low business taxes</strong></h2> <p>Prime minister David Cameron branded Labour's business tax plans as crazy. He said: \"Last week, Labour proposed to put up corporation tax on our biggest and most successful employers. If those taxes are higher here than elsewhere, they don't come here. And if they don't come here, we don't get those jobs.\" Labour's plan is to scrap a proposed corporation tax cut in 2015 and redirect the money to small businesses.</p> <p>Before the last election George Osborne praised Ireland's 12% corporation tax rate. Labour had already cut the rate from 31% in 1997 to 28% by 2008. George Osborne has reduced it to 23% and it will fall to 20% next year.</p> <h2><strong>Innovation</strong></h2> <p>\"We've got to compete with California on innovation; Germany on high-end manufacturing; Asia on finance and technology,\" Cameron said. He said companies that innovate can locate anywhere. But his main lure is tax.</p> <h2><strong>Infrastructure</strong></h2> <p>\"With its wind and wave power, let's make the Humber the centre of clean energy,\" Cameron said. However, energy firm SSE has undermined the push for renewables by cancelling its entire tidal investment strategy.</p> <p>\"With its resources under the ground, let's make Blackpool the centre of Europe for the shale gas industry,\" he said. Blackpool suffered earthquakes off its coastline during fracking exploration last year, and like Balcombe in Sussex, residents are reluctant to go ahead.</p> <p>\"With its brains and research centres, let's make Manchester the world leader in advanced materials,\" he said. However, the much vaunted discovery of graphene - a wonder-material dubbed the new silicon - that has put Manchester on the map needs to be part of a wider investment in science that is constrained by Treasury cuts to publicly funded research and development.</p> <h2><strong>Sound management of the economy</strong> <br></h2> <p>\"Let us never forget the cast-iron law of British politics,\" Cameron told delegates. \"It is Labour who wreck our economy and it's we Conservatives who clear it up,\" Cameron said, avoiding the records of Tory chancellors Reggie Maudling and then Anthony Barber, who landed their Labour successors with messy public finances in the 1960s and 70s.</p> <p>The case against Gordon Brown's stewardship of the economy prior to the financial crash is well rehearsed, but two of his predecessors are credited with leaving the economy in a much better shape than the one they inherited: Sir Stafford Cripps in 1951 and Roy Jenkins in 1970.</p> <h2><strong>Tories understand business</strong></h2> <p>Cameron talked about visiting the Jaguar-Land Rover plant in Solihull, as he often does.</p> <p>He said it was significant that \"since this conference began, over 100,000 jet planes have soared into the sky on wings made in Britain,\" which was a clear reference to Airbus, the Franco-German aviation company that manufactures its wings in the UK.He also mentioned the apprenticeship programme supplied by JCB, a firm also mentioned in his 2011 conference speech.

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has delivered a warning to home owners about the risks of rising interest rates as Threadneedle Street made clear it was keeping a close eye on developments in the housing market. Carney said that people should check to see if they could still afford their repayments on their home loans, when he said, \"rates rise, as they will, when the recovery takes hold\". Speaking on ITV News Anglia, he reinforced the message from another senior bank official, Paul Fisher, saying both borrowers and lenders should be careful not to overstretch themselves. Fisher, Threadneedle Street's executive director of markets, rejected the idea that a property bubble was emerging but stressed that the bank was alert to the risks of another boom-bust. His comments came as latest construction figures revealed a strong increase in private house building, offering a counterpoint to mounting fears that the ground was being laid for a new housing crash. Fisher said the market was clearly gathering momentum after years in the doldrums and prices had again started to hit the headlines. \"I must say that don't see any evidence of bubble behaviour as yet, with mortgage lending still subdued relative to what is likely to be normal levels of activity. The housing market is recovering from a number of years of very low transactions, with house prices having risen well below the inflation rate.\" Recent house price surveys have shown that the cost of property is increasing by about 5% for the UK as a whole and by 10% in London. The bank said this week that the number of home loans approved by lenders in August was the highest since February 2008. Fisher said: \"It is not surprising if we see an adjustment of relative prices when the market recovers, and of course London has special demand pressures which are not present elsewhere in the UK, especially for high-end housing. \"But we may well see a response in new housing supply in due course, limiting the effects of demand on house prices.\" Fisher's comments on housing supply were boosted by construction figures also released on Wednesday which showed the strongest growth in private house building since 2003. A CIPS/Markit survey showed that Britain's construction industry grew for the fifth successive month in September. Private house building has grown strongly over the last year in response to the government's Help to Buy deposit guarantee for new homes. The Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme, which has cut mortgage rates, is also credited with increasing the supply of cheap credit to buy homes. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: \"Construction is no longer the weakest link in the UK economy. The third quarter of 2013 ended with output growth riding high amid greater spending on infrastructure projects and resurgent house-building activity. The reversal in fortunes has spanned commercial, residential and public-sector construction projects.\" The Markit/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) came in at 58.9 for September, down from a near six-year high of 59.1 during August. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. Undaunted by warnings from within his own government of a potential asset bubble, David Cameron announced this week that the government had brought forward the second phase of its Help to Buy scheme for mortgages, from early 2014 to this month. He said: \"Let me assure you that the bank will not be complacent about allowing financial stability risks to build through an over-expansion of the housing market. Both borrowers and lenders need to be careful not to overstretch themselves. \"In line with the recent financial policy committee statement, we will be keeping a very close eye on developments, and the bank has a range of tools that can be used in mitigation of those risks.\" Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the construction sector was exhibiting \"marked sustainable improvement following extended, deep weakness\". Archer said: \"Indeed, the construction sector highly likely saw even stronger expansion in the third quarter than in the second quarter when output grew 1.9% quarter-on-quarter. \"The construction PMI averaged 58.3 in the third, which was up substantially from 50.4 in the second quarter and was the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of 2007. \"This fuels belief that GDP growth in the third quarter could very well have accelerated to close to 1%.\" However, output across the construction industry remains well below its peak and analysts estimate that 100,000- 150,000 construction workers are either working in other sectors or without jobs. According to the Office for National Statistics the construction industry is operating 14% below its pre-crash level.",

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. Here's a very brisk summary. \u2022 Italy's prime minister, Enrico Letta, has won a crucial confidence vote in the Italian Senate, after a humiliated Silvio Berlusconi was forced to abandon his attempt to force fresh elections after a revolt within his own party. Rome correspondent Lizzy Davies's story is here: Berlusconi U-turn saves coalition Letta stormed to victory in the Senate, with 235 votes in support and just 70 against. His success was assured once Berlusconi announced that his People of Freedom (PdL) party would support the coalition. It was a remarkable u-turn, given Italy was plunged into political crisis last week when Berlusconi pulled his ministers out of the government last week. But there were simply too many PdL rebels -- who chose to support Letta rather than their leader. Highlights of the debate start here. In a sombre, defiant speech, Letta warned that Italy would be plunged deeper into crisis and deadlock unless the Senate backed him. Silvio Berlusconi looks wounded tonight, with a troop of senators seemingly defecting, led by his long-time ally Angelino Alfano. Berlusconi still faces the prospect of being thrown out of the Senate and a period of house arrest following his tax fraud conviction. Here's John Hooper's analysis. \u2022 There is shock and anger in Greece after three Golden Dawn MPs were released from custody, having been arrested in a clampdown on the neo-Nazi party last week. \u2022 Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that mortgage buyers should prepare for interest rates to rise once the UK recovery picks up. The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged. Mario Draghi warned that the world economy will suffer unless the US government shutdown ends soon. As I type, this remains on Barack Obama's to-do list, despite Wall Street bank chiefs calling for a breakthrough. You can track the US shutdown development in my US colleagues' liveblog: US government shutdown: Obama to meet congressional leaders \u2013 live I'll be back tomorrow morning. Thanks, and goodnight. GW Mark Carney's warning to home owners tonight about the risk of rising interest rates comes after another senior Bank of England official also pointed to risks when borrowing costs rise in future: My colleagues Larry Elliott and Phillip Inman report: The governor, speaking on ITV News Anglia, reinforced the message from another senior Bank official - Paul Fisher - in which he said both borrowers and lenders should be careful not to overstretch themselves. Fisher, Threadneedle Street\u2019s executive director of markets, rejected the idea that a property bubble was emerging but stressed that the Bank was alert to the risks to the economy from another boom-bust. His comments came as the latest construction figures revealed a strong increase in private housebuilding, offering a counterpoint to mounting fears that the ground is being laid for a new housing crash. Fisher said the market was clearly gathering momentum after years in the doldrums and prices had again started to hit the headlines. \u201cI must say that don\u2019t see any evidence of bubble behaviour as yet, with mortgage lending still subdued relative to what is likely to be normal levels of activity. The housing market is recovering from a number of years of very low transactions, with house prices having risen well below the inflation rate.\u201d The full story will be on our website shortly. Some late breaking news \u2013Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned prospective house buyers to prepare for higher interest rates once the recovery takes hold. That's an interesting intervention from Carney, at a time when mortgage approvals and house prices are rising, and the government is has accelerated its its Help to Buy scheme. The Bank itself has pledged to keep borrowing costs at record lows until the recovery is secure, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 7%. He made the comments to ITV News on a visit to East Anglia today. Details of the interview is breaking now (it was embargoed until 6pm, so half the country's economics correspondents have been eagerly sifting through local Norfolk news for the last 20 minutes, looking for it). ITV's economics editor Richard Edgar is tweeting the highlights: Brenda Kelly of IG sums up the political state of play: It\u2019s akin to entering a type of twilight zone when the world witnesses a quick fix in Italian politics, while the US languishes in uncertainty. Today's Berlusconi U-turn was deemed positive for Italy, politically and economically. Prime minister Enrico Letto won the confidence vote and so the market can expect to see the necessary Italian budget reforms. Enrico Letta gave a victory sign in the lower house of the Italian parliament a few minutes ago, after giving a similar speech to his address in the Senate. As Letta's party controls the lower house, there's no danger of losing a confidence vote there - the Senate was the key battleground today, and Letta was victorious. Alex Young of CMC Markets points out that Wall Street's decline was also due to weak job creation data released this in America today: Today\u2019s monthly ADP employment figure became encumbered with greater significance than the private payroll figure is normally afforded after we\u2019d learner earlier in the week that the non-farm payroll figure will not be produced by the US Federal Bureau of Statistics. The double whammy of a September miss, 166k versus the 180k expected, and revision down of Augusts numbers to 159k from 176k assured a negative open for US equities compounded by the political shambles that has resulted in a second day of shutdowns. Bad news it appears is bad news again\u2026 Relief that Enrico Letta won today's confidence vote pushed up shares on the Milan stock market, while edginess over the US government shutdown hit shares elsewhere. Here's the closing prices: \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 121 points at 18,098, +0.68% \u2022 FTSE 100: down 22 points at 6,437, -0.35% \u2022 German DAX: down 59 points at 8,629, -0.7% \u2022 French CAC: down 40 points at 4,155, - 1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 8 points at 9,350, + 0.1% While on Wall Street the Dow is still in the red, currently down 86 points at 15,106. University of Reading professor Christopher Duggan describes today's drama in the Italian senate as a humiliating u-turn for Silvio Berlusconi, and an enormous boost to prime minister Letta. Duggan explains: It leaves Berlusconi greatly weakened, and with the judicial noose tightening around him, his political star now looks to be firmly waning. However, the increasingly fraught and unstable character of the party political landscape in Italy leaves the government facing some difficult times ahead if it is to pass much needed reforms. From Rome, our correspondent Lizzy Davies reports: Italy's grand coalition government looks certain to limp on after Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister who had brought it to the brink of collapse with a threat to withdraw his MPs, backed down at the last minute when it became clear that rebels from his own party would allow a confidence vote to pass. In an unusually curt statement in the upper house of parliament, the 77-year-old \u2013 who was convicted of tax fraud in August \u2013 said his deeply divided centre-right Freedom People (PdL) party would vote as a block to support Enrico Letta's coalition. It was a humiliating defeat for the man who has dominated the Italian political landscape for two decades, even if, by choosing to support the government, he will no doubt reserve the right to present himself as a responsible statesman. Here's her full story: Silvio Berlusconi U-turn keeps Italy's grand coalition afloat We have more details and reaction from Greece to this morning's shock decision to release from custody three of the four Golden Dawn MPs accused of using the party to operate a criminal organisation. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: To say there is shock at the release of the four far-rightists only hours before Golden Dawn\u2019s leader was due to defend himself before an investigating magistrate in Athens is to understate the fact. Although the governing coalition is playing down the decision - with several ministers insisting that the penal process has \u201conly just begun\u201d \u2013 stunned reactions are coming through from the political opposition. Fotis Kouvelis, the leader of the small Democratic Left party that was in government until it broke ranks earlier this year, said allowing the three MPs to walk free \u201chad undoubtedly created a political climate\u201d \u2013 a coded reference to further political tensions. Dimitris Papadimoulis, the parliamentary representative of the main opposition Syriza party, went further questioning the point of arresting the MPs on charges of operating a criminal organisation at all. \u201cIf they were going to set them free then what was the point of the show with the handcuffs?\u201d he tweeted. High-powered lawyers wondered if this was the first step in the dissolution of the case \u2013 a shocking step in itself given that the case had been instigated at the highest level of executive and judicial power with a Supreme Court prosecutor leveling the charges. \u201cThis development shows that at least in the eyes of the court authorities the case was not substantiated enough,\u201d said Harris Ikonopoulos, the publisher of the left-leaning daily Eleftherotypia and a leading lawyer himself. \u201cIt creates the perception of a failed state,\u201d he told me adding that it would raise \u201call sorts of questions\u201d not least that of the competency of Greek justice. If the reactions of the three MPs themselves are anything to go by it will also embolden Golden Dawn. The neo-Nazi party is quite clearly on a war path with the media in the wake of revelations since the fatal stabbing of Greek rapper Pavlos Fyssas. The obscenities hurled today at journalists \u2013 who in two cases were also kicked and shoved \u2013 takes that confrontation to a whole new level. \u201cNow you will see you disgusting people,\u201d Ilias Panaghiotaros, one of the deputies, roared. \u201cYou will only stop us with bullets.\u201d The abuse came less than 24 hours after Eleni Zaroulia, the wife of Golden Dawn leader Nikos Michaloliakos, spat at a journalist and physically attacked a cameraman outside the court. As shares drop on Wall Street, this photo shows just how quiet it is in Washington DC. Hopefully politicans heard Mario Draghi's warning today that the world economy will suffer unless the US government is reopened soon: Looks like Wall Street may have finally woken up to the US government shutdown. With federal government services still shuttered, and no signs of progress on Capitol Hill, the Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 140 points after an hour's trading, a loss of 0.9% to 15056. Analysts were surprised yesterday that investors reacted so calmly. Looks like it's second-thoughts time. Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, told Marketwatch that investors were: having a little rethink over the implications and longevity of the U.S. government shutdown. Good idea, I'd suggest, with America getting closer to hitting the US debt ceiling. For all the latest on the US government shutdown, follow Tom McCarthy's liveblog: US government shutdown enters second day without resolution \u2013 live An Italian lip reader has watched a recording of Enrico Letta, at the moment Silvio Berlusconi announced that People of Freedom would support him in today's vote. I mentioned earlier that Letta wasn't delirious with joy -- turns out he also muttered \"He's a great.....\" but didn't catch the final word. Any ideas? I suspect it wasn't \"Statesman\" Our Southern Europe editor, John Hooper, explains that Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom party is still likely to split, despite his decision to drop attempts to bring down Enrico Letta's government. And Berlusconi also faces the prospect of being ejected from the Senate in the coming days. Here's John's analysis: Corriere della Sera\u2019s Berlusconi-watcher put it nicely in a tweet: he\u2019s \u201cthe only person in the world who can win, lose and draw the same game\u201d. But the same might almost be said of Enrico Letta. A real win would have been to crush a defiant Silvio Berlusoni in parliament and go forward with a new, more cohesive majority. That is the prospect that caused Tuesday's market euphoria. But it has not happened. Nevertheless, the media tycoon has been challenged, and effectively so. And now it looks as if there is going to be a split, with perhaps 26 of his deputies (out of 97) and 18 of his Senators (out of 91) leaving to form a new group. Those numbers would probably have been enough to give Letta a bare majority. So Berlusconi no longer has an indisputable veto over the government, and that should make Letta\u2019s life easier in future. But the future in Italy still looks tempestuous, and the prospects for radical economic reform distinctly uncertain. On Friday, a parliamentary panel is due to begin the process of ejecting Berlusconi from the Senate. He could resign rather than face that indignity. But thereafter the focus will shift from the parliament to the courts: there is a humiliating decision for the TV magnate to take as to whether he should do community service or accept house arrest; then the appeal in the \u2018Bunga Bunga trial\u2019 and another for leaking confidential judicial evidence; then possible indictment for bribery. It is small compensation for him that the shenanigans of the last few days have enabled him to disown what will doubtless be an unpopular VAT rise. European central bank president Mario Draghi warned that the US government shutdown could hurt the global recovery if it is not resolved soon. Asked about the deadlock in Washington, Draghi said the shutdown, which began at midnight yesterday, \"is a risk if it is protracted\". At the present time, the impresson one has it that it will not be so. But if it were to be protected, it is certainly a risk to the US and the world recovery, so we need to have it present in our minds. And asked again about Italy, Draghi said that the financial markets have a simple message for governments - they want \"stability and reforms\". For anyone just joining us.... Silvio Berlusconi has dropped his attempt to bring down Italy's fragile coalition government, the latest twist in the country's political drama. In a dramatic move, the former prime minister announced that he would back prime minister Enrico Letta in today's crucial vote of confidence. This ensures that Letta will continue as PM, and spares Italy the risk of new general elections -- in the short term at least. That vote was called after Berlusconi ordered ministers from his own People of Freedom (PdL) party to withdraw from Letta's coalition late last week. Berlusconi's hand was forced by a revolt from a group of his own senators, who vowed to defy their leader and vote with Letta. That raised the prospect of the PdL faction imploding. Berlusconi's u-turn meant that Enrico Letta stormed to victory in today's vote, with 235 senators backing him and just 70 voting against. Back at the ECB press conference in Paris, Mario Draghi is asked to comment on the Italian political crisis. He agrees to answer in general terms, and tells reporters that such dramas aren't as dangerous as before: While instability may be hampering hopes for a recovery in these countries, it doesn't really hurt the foundations of the eurozone as it used to do a few years ago. In other worlds, the eurozone and the euro is more resilient than a few years ago. Why? Draghi cited improved governance in the euro area, the ECB's own promise to buy eurozone government bonds if needed. It looks like an even bigger win for Letta than the provisional voting figures indicated - 235 votes in support in the confidence vote, and just 70 against. Reuters newsflash: ITALIAN SENATE SPEAKER DECLARES PM LETTA HAS WON CONFIDENCE VOTE Still waiting for final voting figures -- the ones i posted a few minute ago may still be provisional... Mario Draghi revealed that the ECB governing council also considered a rate cut - before leaving borrowing costs unchanged. And he also brought up the possibility of another round of cheap loans for commercial banks, to encourage lending. Squinting back at the ECB press conference in Paris... Mario Draghi remained concerned about the euro economy, saying risks remain to the downside [they'd be riskier if the Italian government had just sunk]. He also urged eurozone governments to continue taking steps to tackle their deficits. Confirmation that Enrico Letta has won today's confidence vote comfortably, following Silvio Berlusconi's decision to back him (although he was on track to win anyway, it seems). Lizzy Davies provides the details -- although these look like provisional figures at this stage...: \u2022 229 yes votes \u2022 70 no votes \u2022 1 abstention \u2022 20 absent Sounds like Berlusconi's exit from the Senate was lively: No early drama from Mario Draghi at the ECB press conference. He's reiterating that the ECB will keep interest rates at present or lower levels for an extended period of time -- given the low inflation and weak economic growth in the eurozone. And he's talking about the governing council standing ready to launch new monetary 'instruments' if needed to support the eurozone economy (that could be new cheap loans for banks). BREAKING: Enrico Letta has won enough votes to win the confidence vote, according to reports from Italy Heads-up: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi's press conference is about to start in Paris. Live stream here. I'll keep one eye on it -- the other eye is pointed at Rome #crosseyed It will be fascinating to see what Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, makes of the Italian situation when he begins a press conference in 20 minutes time (as expected, they have left interest rates unchanged) Our Southern European editor John Hooper says Berlusconi has saved face, but lost influence: Enrico Letta definitely looked less than euphoric as Berlusconi yanked hard on the political handbrake, and declared with palpable understatement: we have decided, not without some internal strife, to support the government. The general view among Italian political journalists is that Letta would be much better off without Berlusconi around at all. Instead, Letta remains the prime minister of a shaky coalition. Having said that, Berlusconi is damaged by the antics of the last few days. The remarkable political gymnastics must have taken their toll -- and an optimist might argue that PdL is irrevocably on the path to a new future.... What drama! So, here's the position. By sensationally dropping his opposition to Enrico Letta, Silvio Berlusconi has guaranteed that the Italian government survives. Add all Berlusconi's PdL senators to Letta's existing support -- his PD party, plus small parties and senators for life -- and it's a healthy majority. So why did Berlusconi do it? Clearly, he concluded that he could not keep enough of his PdL party onside. The photo I included in the blog earlier showed a long list of rebels. If Berlusconi hadn't pulled such a SCREECHING u-turn, then he would presumably have seen his group shatter. The moderates would have followed Letta, and he'd have been left nursing a rump faction. The Italian stock market jumped as the news came in, pushing the FTSE MIB up 1.4% today. Italian government debt prices remain high, with the yield on 10-year bonds down at 4.38% (from 4.46% yesterday). Here's the key quotes from Berlusoni, before he threw his support behind Letta a few moments ago. Berlusconi himself buried his head in his hands after announcing that the PdL party will support Letta -- which means today's confidence vote is a WIN for the prime minister. It was not the speech of a winner -- rather of a man whose long grip on his party may be slipping . There's applause in the Senate as Berlusconi says he will support Enrico Letta -- although I think I saw Letta pull a rather rueful grin. BERLUSCONI SAYS HE AND HIS PEOPLE OF FREEDOM PARTY WILL SUPPORT LETTA. Berlusconi is addressing the Senate in an atmosphere of silence, trying to sound statesmanlike.... Berlusconi's got the microphone! Former technocratic prime minister Mario Monti just gave a brisk speech, in which he urged senators not to risk Italy falling into the troika and its \"neocolonial oversight\". If Italy is forced to take a bailout, it could take years to recover, Monti warned. While we wait for that vote, here's Reuters' report on Letta's second speech to the Senate: Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said on Wednesday his government could achieve reforms even with a smaller majority, as he wound up a debate on a confidence vote in which he has been boosted by dissidents from Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right party. \"Our government can reach its objectives despite the fact that the majority's numbers have changed,\" Letta said as he formally put a confidence motion to the Senate, which is expected to complete the vote in the early afternoon. Letta spoke at length about Italy's role in the European Union and his goal to push for greater integration during the country's rotating presidency in the second half of 2014, suggesting he sees his government lasting at least until 2015. The vote hasn't actually started yet. Senators are continuing to give their views. The latest word from Rome is that Berlusconi isn't expected to speak (but given today's twists and turns, let's see). Rome correspondent Lizzy Davies reports that two distinguished honorary senators, architect Renzo Piano and conductor Claudio Abbado, are both absent because they are out of the country. To repeat, Enrico Letta has called for a vote of confidence. After a dramatic couple of hours in the Senate, we still don't know what's going to happen. There have been rumours that Berlusconi will back Letta, and also that he will order the entire PdL party to vote against. Speculation abounds. We do know that there is a solid bunch of 'dovish' PdL senators who are unlikely to bow to pressure from Berlusconi, and are highly likely to back Letta. But we do not know if it will be enough. As John Hooper flagged up, the Berlusconi rebels are talking about creating a new party called \"Popolari per l'Italia\". Wolf Piccoli, managing director at Teneo Intelligence, is as reliable as any, and he reckons Letta might get 171 votes -- that's a win, as he needs 160 for victory. A briefer speech from Letta this time -- his main message to the Senate is that today is a historic opportunity. Tomorrow the government must get back to work. Amid applause from some members of the senate, Letta calls for a confidence vote: Letta still looks calm: Italian prime Enrico Letta is beginning his second speech to the Senate, explaining that he didn't sleep last night as he worked to hold the government together. He's initially heard in silence (gosh it's tense), but there's some heckling as Letta bluntly tells the Senate that he's not prepared to keep taking \"lessons in morality\" from those who are holding him to ransom. Letta then tells Senators that he needs their support. A smaller majority will make it even hard for him to govern. Enrico Letta is speaking again in the Italian parliament. Reminder: it's being streamed on RAI News. The rumour mill keeps swirling in Italy ahead of this lunchtime's confidence vote. One insider reckons Berlusconi is going to back Letta, the next says he's not. Confusion reigns (not for the first, or last time). John Hooper, our Souther Europe editor, reports that Berlusconi's rebels are talking of creating a new party called \"Popolari per l'Italia\" - even if the loyalist wing of PdL join them by supporting Letta. Plenty of concern in Greece that three Golden Dawn MPs were released from court this morning, and promptly kicked and shoved their way through the assembled media . Here's a flavour: Breaking away to Greece briefly. Four of the Golden Dawn MPs who were arrested as part of the clampdown on the neo-Nazi party appeared in court today. Three of the men were promptly released pending a future trial, while party leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos is due back in court later today. TV footage from the scene shows one cameraman being pushed out of the way, while another man is kicked as the MPs and their supporters leave the scene. Here's the video clip showing the aggressive scenes: And here's Kathimerini's early take: Only one of four Golden Dawn deputies arrested last week on charges of heading a criminal organization responsible for a range of felonies, including murder, assault, blackmail and money laundering, among others, was remanded in custody on Wednesday, while another three were released pending trial, one of them posting a 50,000 euro bail. Yiannis Lagos was expected to be transferred to a local jail on Wednesday following a unanimous decision reached by two investigative magistrates and two prosecutors. Party spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris was ordered to post a \u20ac50,000 bail and not to exit the country. Deputies Ilias Panayiotaros and Nikos Michos were also ordered not to leave the country. The clampdown followed the death of 34-year-old rapper Pavlos Fyssas two weeks ago. A Golden Dawn member was subsequently arrested over the stabbing. More to follow Here's a photo that appears to show the list of Senators from the People of Freedom party who are considering backing Enrico Letta: Rumours flying: It is increasingly likely that Enrico Letta has enough votes for victory, even if Berlusconi decides to back him. Letta needs 161 votes for victory - although he would like more. Vincenzo Scarpetta of Open Europe reckons that he currently has 170 senators behind him, based on the latest reports and public statements. Here's how Barclays summed it up this morning: Letta has the numbers to survive the vote today. The Government needs the support of 161 Senators, and can count on 137. With the support of the life Senators, and defectors from the smaller parties (including M5S) it is likely to get to around 147-149. Letta therefore only needs around 12-14 PdL Senators to defect in order to survive. With the PdL split he is likely to get this. More reaction to the reports that Berlusconi is considering throwing his support behind Enrico Letta in the confidence vote: It would be a stunning u-turn from Silvio Berlusconi if, as reports suggest, he has now decided to back Enrico Letta in today's vote of confidence. But it wouldn't exactly be out of character -- and a number of political journalists and analysts were suggesting yesterday that this might happen, once we learned that his party were rebelling. Remember, it was Berlusconi who triggered this crisis by threatening to bring the government down last week -- by withdrawing his PdL party from the Letta coalition. If he backs Letta today, then he could still trigger a crisis in future. As Serena Ruffoni of the WSJ put it to me: I don't think the Letta government is any stronger even if it survives this confidence vote. Important: Sky Italia is reporting that the People of Freedom party are going to BACK Enrico Letta in the confidence vote. If true, that means Letta would win a solid majority. It would also suggest that Berlusconi has decided that he cannot bring his rebels back into line, and has decided to fall in with them. That is NOT the best result for Letta, though. While he'd still be in power, he'd also still be lumbered with the Berlusconi problem. The Italian stock market surged during Enrico Letta's speech, hitting a new two-year high as the PM sat down. Italian government bonds are also strengthening, which has pushed the yield on its 10-year debt down to 4.37% . It as as high as 4.74% on Monday after Berlusconi launched his bid to bring the Letta government down. Senators are now speaking, with one tearing into Silvio Berlusconi -- calling the former prime minister \"'a simple story of criminality\". The BBC's Gavin Hewitt reckons the gloves are off, as the battle for Italy's future continues: How did he do? Five months isn't enough time to build a track record of leadership success -- and much of Letta's time as prime minister has been overshadowed by Berlusconi's legal defeats. It was a speech of vision -- asking Senators to choose between future of a more competitive, thriving Italy, or a future of political strife, fresh elections, and the prospect of another divided parliament at the end of it. Letta isn't the most thrilling orator in European politics, but he has a mature, sensible style. Highlights of his speech start here. Worth noting that Berlusconi didn't applaud Letta as he ended his speech - so he's not thrown in the towel yet.... Enrico Letta concluded his speech by urging those in the chamber to give him their \"courage and confidence\". \"A confidence that is not against anyone; a confidence that is for Italy\" (quotes via Lizzy). He also urged senators to search their consciences, and avoid a result that would leave them feeling \"shameful regret\". While Letta was speaking, Berlusconi could be seen holding discussion with some of his allies. I grabbed a picture: Oh the drama.... There's also a European theme to the speech -- with Letta speaking of the need to dream of a \"United States of Europe\" one day. That fits with his tradition of being a solid Europhile (he was an MEP at one stage of his career) Letta is outlining his vision for Italy -- saying that growth and jobs must be the focus in 2014. Apparently Berlusconi has told Italian media that he will listen to Letta's speech and then decide whether to support him or not. Enrico Letta's speech is turning into a solid defense of his government's record in the five months since he took over (colleague Lizzy Davies dubs it a \" very level-headed and systematic defense\". But will that be enough to persuade PdL members to back him? As explained earlier -- Letta would like to see 30 rebels jump the fence. He needs more than 20 (I think 24 is the magic number). Letta also cited three priorities -- support economic recovery; cutting taxes on workers, and increasing competition in Italy's economy. Letta is continuing to defend his government's record on the economy -- part of the strategy to persuade moderate members of the Berlusconi camp to back him. It is on ordinary people suffering in economic crisis that our actions will have biggest effect, he said. Here's a better live feed of Enrico Letta's speech in the Senate. Berlusconi's just arrived! He also looks weary, probably due to late night efforts to corall rebelling members of his PdL party into line. No sign of Silvio Berlusconi at the start of Letta's crunch speech. Angelino Alfano (deputy PM) is there, and there's a consensus that he looks nervous. (see 8.22am for a blurry snap of Dudu not being walked) Looks like the confidence vote will come at midday -- earlier than the previous indications. And how many rebels will there be? Lizzy Davies writes: It's all about the numbers today. Giovanardi claimed yesterday there were \"more than 40\"- believed to be as many as 44- PdL MPs prepared to vote for the confidence vote. But the Italian press reports that Berlusconi's hawks told him the rebels were much- much- less numerous. Who's right? We'll find out soon. Letta needs over 20 rebels. He'd be happier with more than 30. Letta went on to warn that a new election could cause the same gridlock as last time: Enrico Letta is urging parliament to give him a mandate for a \"real and new\" pact to tackle Italy's problems. (a reminder -- Italy's last election, in February, resulted in deadlock -- with no party winning a majority in the Senate. Eventually a coalition was agreed between the centre-left PD and Berlusconi's centre-right PdL, with Letta (a senior member of PD) as leader) Here's the key early quotes from Letta's speech: Prime minister Enrico Letta has begun to give one of the speeches of his political life, in a bid to win enough support to continue as the head of Italy's shaky coalition government. Before he started, there was a standing ovation for the country's veteran president, Giorgio Napolitano. Letta began his speech in the Italian parliament by urging its members to \"seize the moment\". And, as expected, he insisted that the legal troubles of Silvio Berlusconi cannot be an excuse to bring the country's government down. But can he persuade enough of Berlusconi's PdL party to back him? Lizzy Davies is tweeting the key points, so I'll be embedding them in the blog now.... Enrico Letta has begun speaking in the Italian parliament. There's a live stream here. However, it's very flaky. Key points from his speech will follow! Update: the latest word from Italy is that we might get the confidence vote around midday, not this evening as I initially thought. Europe's stock markets are all in the red today, with the FTSE 100 shedding 73 points. There's nervousness about the situation in Italy, and also a knock-on effect from a bad day in Asia. The US Federal government shutdown isn't exactly helping sentiment. Overnight, the Nikkei tumbled 2% after the latest stimulus package from prime minister Abe failed to excite investors. In the City, Tesco's shares are leading the fallers on the FTSE 100 after issuing a trading statement, down over 3%. Britain's biggest supermarket reported zero growth in like-for like UK sales, excluding fuel and VAT sales tax, in the 13 weeks to 24 August. Tesco also warned that it faced 'challenging economic conditions' overseas. Europe was particularly tough, with profits down almost 70% and like-for-like sales down by 5% in the first half of the year. Sainsbury posted stronger figures in the UK (as expected) - sales at British stores open at least a year were up 2%. Its shares are also suffering, though, down 1.5%. More here. Wolf Piccoli, managing director at Teneo Intelligence, agrees that it could be a long day in the Rome parliament: Analysts at Nordea Markets say it's \"fight night\" in Italy, and possibly Berlusconi's final bout. In the red corner, we have PM Letta, who has probably worked hard \u2013 together with the President \u2013 to convince some of Berlusconi\u2019s senators that new elections at this point is in no one\u2019s interest. A vote for a continuation of the current government and later on a vote for a budget and a new electoral law would make for a fresh start after spring elections. In the blue corner, we have Berlusconi. Media are full of stories about Berlusconi\u2019s outstanding merits when it comes to winning tight political battles. But this time it seems that even members of his own party believes he has gone too far. Even Alfano \u2013 who has been seen as the crown prince in the PDL \u2013 said that he might vote for a continuation of the government. Furthermore, it may be the old Champs last fight, if he is stripped of his senatorial seat on Friday. It will be a close call. Italy, and to a lesser extent Spain, will sell off if the government falls. Jeremy Cook of World First agrees: What might Letta tell parliament in his speech this morning? Lizzy Davies explains that his speech is likely to focus on the socio-economic suffering of Italy, and tell deputies that they cannot just let its government fall. His strategy will be to ram home the idea that the judicial woes of one man* have to be kept separate from the interests of the country \u2013 in an effort to split the doves in Berlusconi's party from the hawks. \u2022 - that man being Berlusconi himself, of course, who is on the brink of being expelled from the Senate after his tax fraud conviction. In the comments section, regular reader mrwicket has outlined the potential scenarios from tonight's vote. As he flags up, we're not 100% certain that a confidence vote will actually be called -- Enrico Letta will probably judge the mood of the Senate first, and if he feels he can't win then he might simply resign. Lisa Jucca, Reuters chief financial correspondent in Italy, agrees that this could be the moment that Angelino Alfano, Berlusconi's right-hand man for so long, finally rises up: Silvio Berlusconi is facing an unprecedented rebellion, opening up the possibility that Letta can surge to victory tonight. As our Rome correspondent, Lizzy Davies, explains: To win the confidence vote in the senate, Letta needs to attract extra votes from either the centre-right PdL or the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) to reach the magic number of 161. He has said, however, that he has no interest in continuing at the head of a government that only sneaks in by a handful of votes. His chances appeared to have been significantly boosted on Tuesday, when Carlo Giovanardi, a long-time ally of Berlusconi, struck the first major blow when he announced that \"more than 40\" PdL MPs were prepared to vote to keep the government afloat. Then, in a stunning move likened by one observer to an \"Et tu, Brute?\" moment, Angelino Alfano, the deputy prime minister long seen as Berlusconi's political heir, appeared to solidify the mutiny. \"I remain firmly convinced that all our party should tomorrow back the confidence vote in Letta,\" he said, according to Ansa. Here's the full story: Silvio Berlusconi's allies turn on him to keep Italy's grand coalition alive Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone, the financial markets, the world economy and the business world. After yesterday's foray into the US shutdown , we're back in familiar territory today \u2013 the political crisis in Italy, with a monthly meeting of the European Central Bank on top. Enrico Letta, Italy's prime minister, is heading to parliament this morning for a make-or-break confidence vote. It was triggered by Silvio Berlusconi's decision last Saturday to ordered his ministers out of the coalition, to bring Letta down. Does Letta still have the support of the lower house, and the Senate? If not, Italy could be plunged deeper into chaos. But Letta could win, and wins well, if Berlusconi's centre-right party defy their disgraced leader and through their support behind the PM. Yesterday, key members of the People of Freedom party (PdL) said they would support the coalition [an alliance between Letta's own centre-left PD and the PdL]. The big question is how many PdL members of the Senate decide to throw their support behind Letta today. Letta is due to start giving his first speech at around 9.30am Rome time, or 8.30am BST. The actual confidence vote could be quite late (we'll update with firm timings when we have them). The other key event in the eurozone today is the monthly meeting of the ECB's governing council. They're in Paris today. We're not expecting any change to interest rates. There's also a press conference at 2.30pm Paris time (1.30pm BST), where Mario Draghi will be quizzed over a range of issues, doubtless including his homeland of Italy. I'll be tracking all the developments through the day...",

The picture is not quite as bleak as that bald statistic suggests since Tesco is still the UK's most profitable retailer by a country mile, let's not forget. What's more, chief executive Philip Clarke, recipient of a hospital pass from predecessor Sir Terry Leahy, can point to two definite improvements. First, his overhaul of the core UK machine may be working \u2013 albeit slowly. The second quarter was not as weak as the first; profit margins were stable at 5.2%; and Tesco has discovered, with relief, that sales have improved in stores where it has thrown money at the problem. Second, Clarke may have found an escape route from Tesco's Chinese embarrassment, which has never received the attention of the Fresh &amp; Easy debacle in the US but has been every bit as painful in financial terms. Tesco in injecting its 134 Chinese stores plus shopping malls into the retailing business of the state-controlled market leader. Once it has also handed over a pile of cash, Tesco will get a 20% stake in China Resources Vanguard. This represents an appalling return on the couple of billion quid of capital invested in China over the past decade, but the new strategy may qualify as a case of making the best of a bad job. Clarke had to do something. He could not credibly have pursued a go-it-alone strategy that yielded a pre-tax loss in China last year of \u00a3222m. So much for the good (ish) news. The list of negatives is longer. Tesco screwed up its merchandising and marketing in Thailand. It has too many stores in the wrong places in Turkey. Its hypermarkets in Poland and central Europe are being shunned by locals who are returning to local shopping. Asia, excluding China, has problems but is still a solid-looking operation returning a half-year trading profit of \u00a3314m and profit margins of 6%; but continental Europe is destroying value for shareholders, returning a miserable trading profit of \u00a355m on sales of \u00a35.35bn. Clarke, rushing from his US crisis to his China crisis, now has to confront a central European crisis. Forget excitements like Hudl tablets and the blinkbox online offer at home.

The UK fightback could have been further advanced by now. As it is, Sainsbury's is still trotting along nicely, with like-for-like sales rising by 1.5% in the half-year, and still winning market share. Clarke, surely, would have hoped to reverse that trend by now. But his slipups are minor compared with those of Leahy in the later years of his 13-year reign. Tesco could have been satisfied with UK domination and a handful of low-risk overseas adventures. Instead it chose to try global domination. Leahy's attempt to conquer the US and China simultaneously will be recorded as a lesson in the perils of over-confidence.

With limited tools, we had limited choices. </p> <p>That said, we could have been more muscular about Tarp's requirements, or about cracking down on weaker firms. By 2009, we had stabilized the system \u2013 and that's when we could have started enforcing accountability. We should have forced the banks to clean up their balance sheets, take their losses, and get out there to lend, which is what the economy needed to restart. That was the original idea behind Tarp, and we didn't do that.</p> <p>We never forced them to clean up their assets, probably because the losses would have been massive. The government was too focused on making the banks profitable again, so we didn't make them eat their losses. The rationale went that restored profitability would return confidence to the system. Instead, it brought public resentment and anger \u2013 and didn't help the economy. </p> <p>Banks with a lot of troubled assets on their books nurse those assets.

The government has the power to restructure a failed institution; to force it to deal with troubled assets; to break it up and downsize it; and to make it healthy enough to contribute to the real economy.</p> <p>There were other forms of support, too. The FDIC was asked by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to guarantee unsecured debt \u2013 debt without collateral \u2013 for these large financial institutions. We launched the <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/TLGP/faq.html\">Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program</a> which helped keep the system liquid. Large financial institutions borrowed heavily in the short-term credit markets, and they were having trouble renewing expired debt. We helped them access enough funding to remain operational. It was a risk, but it worked. </p> <p>Combined with Tarp and the Fed's trillions in lending programs, the government collectively threw a lot of money at the big financial institutions. But Tarp investments used taxpayer money, whereas the FDIC \u2013 though backed by the government \u2013 obtains its finances by charging banks for deposit insurance. Therefore our program, at least, was met with less controversy. </p> <p>But the important point remains the same: it's appropriate in times of system-wide stress for government to intervene and make support available. Capital investments \u2013 like Tarp \u2013 are not a good idea. Government shouldn't take on ownership stakes in banks; it's not consistent with a market-based system.</p> <p>I don't want anyone who's big to have a giant \"put\" on taxpayers. It's problematic for big financial firms think that they can profit by taking a lot of risks, and if they lose money they can put it on taxpayers. There's no more damaging and destabilizing message the government can send than this idea that if you're big, the government will get you out of trouble.</p> <p>Is the financial system safe?

Large financial institutions borrowed heavily in the short-term credit markets, and they were having trouble renewing expired debt. We helped them access enough funding to remain operational. It was a risk, but it worked. Combined with Tarp and the Fed's trillions in lending programs, the government collectively threw a lot of money at the big financial institutions. But Tarp investments used taxpayer money, whereas the FDIC \u2013 though backed by the government \u2013 obtains its finances by charging banks for deposit insurance. Therefore our program, at least, was met with less controversy. But the important point remains the same: it's appropriate in times of system-wide stress for government to intervene and make support available. Capital investments \u2013 like Tarp \u2013 are not a good idea. Government shouldn't take on ownership stakes in banks; it's not consistent with a market-based system. I don't want anyone who's big to have a giant \"put\" on taxpayers. It's problematic for big financial firms think that they can profit by taking a lot of risks, and if they lose money they can put it on taxpayers. There's no more damaging and destabilizing message the government can send than this idea that if you're big, the government will get you out of trouble. Is the financial system safe? I think it's safer than it was, but not as safe as it should be. Sheila Bair is the former chair of the FDIC and the author of Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself. She is currently the chair of the Systemic Risk Council, co-founded by the Pew Charitable Trusts and the CFA Institute. This has been reproduced as told to Heidi Moore. Guy LeBas: \"Tarp provided a much needed shot of confidence\" This week marks five years since Congress passed (on the second vote) and then-President Bush signed into law the Troubled Asset Relief Program, more affectionately known as Tarp. Originally envisioned as a fund that would purchase so-called toxic waste from bank balance sheets, the program quickly morphed into a mandatory capital injection for the nation's largest banks, an optional source of capital for other healthy depositories, and a bailout vehicle for automakers. Tarp has evoked a range of responses, but the initial round of capital injections clearly provided a much-needed shot of confidence to a financial system at legitimate risk of collapse. It's hard to overestimate the importance of confidence in the contemporary financial system. It underlies nearly every transaction, contract, or exchange of funds. In a financial society that crosses borders, our traditional form of confidence \u2013 personally knowing those to whom you're transferring cash \u2013simply can't exist. Financial technology essentially forced the development of a new form of trust: institutional confidence. The failure and sale of Bear Stearns, the failure of Lehman, and the hint of similar risks elsewhere threatened that system of institutional confidence which the global markets required to function. Tarp was the first step in restoring that institutional confidence. The need for Tarp in 2008 was quite clear, but the program's legacy is essentially non-existent. From a market perspective, Tarp staunched the bleeding of institutional confidence and played a clear role in re-laying the foundations for a 54% rebound in the S&amp;P 500 in the last five years. From a cost perspective, Tarp as an investment has returned about $39bln in net profits, with $54bln still outstanding, according to ProPublica. Both of these measures are now five years ex post facto, and don't do justice to the environment under which it was conceived. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act ostensibly banned all future Tarp-like bailouts, though it stands to reason that, in extreme circumstances, Congress could simply eliminate that provision. In assessing the ultimate need and value of Tarp, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson summed up the situation in a way that captured the financial zeitgeist of 2008: \"Government owning a stake in any private US company is objectionable \u2026 yet the alternative of leaving businesses and consumers without access to financing is totally unacceptable.\" Guy LeBas is the chief fixed income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott.",

    "webTitle": "Governments must not relax credit standards to boost growth, IMF warns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned governments to resist the temptation to relax credit standards to boost growth as it highlighted the UK's lack of lending to small businesses. The global lender of last resort, which helped rescue Ireland, Portugal and Greece from bankruptcy, said policymakers need to weigh the short-term benefits of relaxing credit standards against the potential for a repeat of the 2008 lending bubble. The warning comes less than a week after Conservative leader David Cameron pledged to bring forward the coalition's Help to Buy mortgage support scheme, that critics say could spark a surge in house prices ahead of a devastating crash. The IMF said banks remained in a weak state across much of the developed world and a stumbling block to economic growth, which depends on a flourishing and competitive market for commercial and mortgage loans. In its biannual global financial stability report, the Washington-based lender said it was tempting for governments to allow central banks to support lending and for ministers to relax lending rules to boost growth, but the costs over the longer term could be high. Echoing a similar warning by Bank of England official Paul Fisher in a speech earlier on Wednesday, the IMF said: \"When credit policies work well to support credit growth and an economic recovery, financial stability is enhanced, but policymakers should also be cognisant of longer potential risks to financial stability. \"The main risk centres on increased credit risk, including a relaxation of underwriting standards and the risk of 'evergreening' existing loans,\" it said. The IMF, which counts the UK among its chief financial backers, is always wary of criticising member governments directly. In recent reports analysing the UK's economic situation, it has pointed out that the chancellor, George Osborne, could increase spending on infrastructure to boost growth. It has also hinted strongly that the UK's central bank could follow the US Federal Reserve and offer more direct support to the main high-street lenders, primarily by buying some of their mortgages. Osborne has encouraged the Bank of England to take a more interventionist role to support lending following his \u00a385bn Funding for Lending Scheme and the more recent Help to Buy, which could underwrite \u00a3130bn of mortgages. However, the initiative has yet to boost the credit used by small business. The IMF said: \"The UK authorities adopted a number of measures to boost credit, but their effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated. This could be due to the relatively short period during which they have been in place.\" Figures from the Bank of England on Monday showed mortgage approvals jumped to their highest since 2008, which is largely credited to the FLS, which provided banks with cheaper funds than available on the international money markets, and Help to Buy. However, lending to non-financial businesses fell in August and was down 3.6% year on year, supporting figures from the Office for National Statistics, which showed business investment fell 2.7% in the second quarter. The IMF said its preliminary review of business lending in the UK revealed that business were more concerned about the demand for their goods and the prospect of weak economic growth than the cost of credit. \"If this were to be confirmed through additional, more detailed analysis, then policies that support demand may be more effective in boosting credit.\" Keynesian economists have long criticised the IMF for backing moves by member governments to tackle supply-side reforms, including making credit easier, in opposition to calls for boosts to public spending to increase the demand for goods and services. These critics, including Princeton University's Paul Krugman, have argued that both the supply of credit and policies to increase demand are needed to recover from a deep recession and financial crisis.",

      "body": "<p>The International Monetary Fund has warned governments to resist the temptation to relax credit standards to boost growth as it highlighted the UK's lack of lending to small businesses.</p> <p>The global lender of last resort, which helped rescue Ireland, Portugal and Greece from bankruptcy, said policymakers need to weigh the short-term benefits of relaxing credit standards against the potential for a repeat of the 2008 lending bubble.</p> <p>The warning comes less than a week after Conservative leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/28/conservatives-help-to-buy-cameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron pledged to bring forward the coalition's Help to Buy mortgage support scheme</a>, that critics say could spark a surge in house prices ahead of a devastating crash.</p> <p>The IMF said banks remained in a weak state across much of the developed world and a stumbling block to economic growth, which depends on a flourishing and competitive market for commercial and mortgage loans.</p> <p>In its biannual <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfsr/index.htm\" title=\"\">global financial stability report</a>, the Washington-based lender said it was tempting for governments to allow central banks to support lending and for ministers to relax lending rules to boost growth, but the costs over the longer term could be high.</p> <p>Echoing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/02/bank-of-england-help-to-buy-concerns\" title=\"\">a similar warning by Bank of England official Paul Fisher in a speech</a> earlier on Wednesday, the IMF said: \"When credit policies work well to support credit growth and an economic recovery, financial stability is enhanced, but policymakers should also be cognisant of longer potential risks to financial stability.</p> <p>\"The main risk centres on increased credit risk, including a relaxation of underwriting standards and the risk of 'evergreening' existing loans,\" it said.</p> <p>The IMF, which counts the UK among its chief financial backers, is always wary of criticising member governments directly. In recent reports analysing the UK's economic situation, it has pointed out that the chancellor, George Osborne, could increase spending on infrastructure to boost growth. It has also hinted strongly that the UK's central bank could follow the US Federal Reserve and offer more direct support to the main high-street lenders, primarily by buying some of their mortgages.</p> <p>Osborne has encouraged the Bank of England to take a more interventionist role to support lending following his \u00a385bn Funding for Lending Scheme and the more recent Help to Buy, which could underwrite \u00a3130bn of mortgages. However, the initiative has yet to boost the credit used by small business.</p> <p>The IMF said: \"The UK authorities adopted a number of measures to boost credit, but their effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated. This could be due to the relatively short period during which they have been in place.\"</p> <p>Figures from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/30/mortgage-approvals-five-year-high\" title=\"\">the Bank of England on Monday showed mortgage approvals jumped to their highest since 2008</a>, which is largely credited to the FLS, which provided banks with cheaper funds than available on the international money markets, and Help to Buy.</p> <p>However, lending to non-financial businesses fell in August and was down 3.6% year on year, supporting figures from the Office for National Statistics, which showed business investment fell 2.7% in the second quarter.</p> <p>The IMF said its preliminary review of business lending in the UK revealed that business were more concerned about the demand for their goods and the prospect of weak economic growth than the cost of credit.</p> <p>\"If this were to be confirmed through additional, more detailed analysis, then policies that support demand may be more effective in boosting credit.\"</p> <p>Keynesian economists have long criticised the IMF for backing moves by member governments to tackle supply-side reforms, including making credit easier, in opposition to calls for boosts to public spending to increase the demand for goods and services.</p> <p>These critics, including Princeton University's Paul Krugman, have argued that both the supply of credit and policies to increase demand are needed to recover from a deep recession and financial crisis.</p>",

The failure and sale of Bear Stearns, the failure of Lehman, and the hint of similar risks elsewhere threatened that system of institutional confidence which the global markets required to function. Tarp was the first step in restoring that institutional confidence.\" Read more here. Anat Admati: professor of finance and economics at Stanford \"Tarp's legacy is disturbing. Most of those who got into financial trouble because of \"troubled assets\" suffered severe consequences, and many innocent people are still suffering the collateral damage. Those who aren't are the bankers who took excessive risks and the policymakers who did not control the system effectively. They would prefer us to think that everything is fine now, when in fact much too little has changed.\" Read more here.",

      "body": "<p>Tom Alexander, the former EE boss and founder of Virgin Mobile, who made a fortune for Sir Richard Branson by helping democratise the mobile phone, has returned to the telecoms industry.</p> <p>The sports car racing enthusiast left EE to spend more time with his collection of classic cars in July 2011, but has now returned as non-executive chairman of Viacloud.</p> <p>Private equity owned Viacloud was set up to create white label virtual mobile networks for consumer brands, by wholesaling airtime on EE's platform. It hopes to create the UK's first 4G virtual network, and has the billing platforms, customer support and network management tools to support up to 7 million customers. Its first client will come to market within weeks.</p> <p>\"The internet is rife with a whole number of strong consumer brands, like games companies, bringing interesting propositions to consumers and all of that is going mobile,\" said Alexander. \"4G is going to open up a massive opportunity for content players.\"</p> <p>Supermarkets including Asda and Tesco already sell mobile connections, and those Mobile Network Virtual Operators (MVNOs) already using EE's masts include Phones 4u and TalkTalk business customers.</p> <p>Alexander made headlines last year with efforts to co-ordinate an \u00a38bn private equity bid for his former company, EE, with KKR and Apax Partners mentioned as potential backers. EE's owners, Orange and Deutsche Telekom, are expected to float the company next year.</p> <p>In 1998, Alexander persuaded Branson to back his plan for a consumer friendly mobile brand, which would piggy back on T-Mobile's masts. The venture made \u00a320m for Alexander and much more than that for Virgin Group.</p> <p>Branson floated the company for \u00a3500m in 2004 and then sold for nearly \u00a31bn to NTL in 2006, as part of a complex deal that united Britain's two largest cable operators into Virgin Media.</p> <p>\"With Virgin Mobile we helped bring the mobile phone mass market,\" Alexander said some years later. \"Before, it was a corporate tool, or for a select few. Virgin democratised the mobile and made it available to everyone.\" Viacloud marks Alexander's second telecoms comeback.

      "bodyText": "Tom Alexander, the former EE boss and founder of Virgin Mobile, who made a fortune for Sir Richard Branson by helping democratise the mobile phone, has returned to the telecoms industry. The sports car racing enthusiast left EE to spend more time with his collection of classic cars in July 2011, but has now returned as non-executive chairman of Viacloud. Private equity owned Viacloud was set up to create white label virtual mobile networks for consumer brands, by wholesaling airtime on EE's platform. It hopes to create the UK's first 4G virtual network, and has the billing platforms, customer support and network management tools to support up to 7 million customers. Its first client will come to market within weeks. \"The internet is rife with a whole number of strong consumer brands, like games companies, bringing interesting propositions to consumers and all of that is going mobile,\" said Alexander. \"4G is going to open up a massive opportunity for content players.\" Supermarkets including Asda and Tesco already sell mobile connections, and those Mobile Network Virtual Operators (MVNOs) already using EE's masts include Phones 4u and TalkTalk business customers. Alexander made headlines last year with efforts to co-ordinate an \u00a38bn private equity bid for his former company, EE, with KKR and Apax Partners mentioned as potential backers. EE's owners, Orange and Deutsche Telekom, are expected to float the company next year. In 1998, Alexander persuaded Branson to back his plan for a consumer friendly mobile brand, which would piggy back on T-Mobile's masts. The venture made \u00a320m for Alexander and much more than that for Virgin Group. Branson floated the company for \u00a3500m in 2004 and then sold for nearly \u00a31bn to NTL in 2006, as part of a complex deal that united Britain's two largest cable operators into Virgin Media. \"With Virgin Mobile we helped bring the mobile phone mass market,\" Alexander said some years later. \"Before, it was a corporate tool, or for a select few. Virgin democratised the mobile and made it available to everyone.\" Viacloud marks Alexander's second telecoms comeback. He left Virgin in 2006, after its sale to NTL, but was persuaded back to run Orange in the UK in 2008. Within two years, he had merged the business with T-Mobile, creating a market leader with 28m customers by uniting the country's third and fourth biggest players. Alexander said he was planning a gradual return to corporate life. \"It doesn't feel like I've really left,\" he said. \"I needed to discover I had a family but I've kept in touch with friends. I had a nice break but I will look at putting together a portfolio of non-executive posts next year.\"",
