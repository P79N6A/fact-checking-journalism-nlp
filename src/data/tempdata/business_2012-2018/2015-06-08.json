      "bodyText": "Some more tasty lines from Yanis tonight: And there is sympathy for Greece\u2019s plight in the hall: (and that probably is all from me until the morning....) If you missed Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s speech in Berlin tonight, you can rewind the live feed and listen to it now..... Varoufakis then outlines how Greece needs a Speech of Hope, comparable to the address given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes in Germany in 1946. Byrnes\u2019s speech signalled the rebirth of Germany\u2019s economy after the second world war; now, Greece looks to Angela Merkel to give a new version, outlining a bold future. And in a nice touch, he offers the services of Jamie Galbraith, the US economist who advises Greece, to help write it. His father, JK Galbraith, helped write Byrnes speech, after all. This speech would be a sea change in European politics, Varoufakis argues, paving the way to closer integration and closer bonds. This is a theme he outlined in a blog post last weekend: A Speech of Hope for Greece \u2013 a Project Syndicate Op-Ed A deal is within reach, Varoufakis tells his audience. It could be hammered out in one evening, one long night. Leaders could just work until 4am and get a deal done. And it would have some key elements. 1) An independent tax authority, free from interference from politicians or corporations 2) Debt relief, to give Greece room to breath and return to growth. He cites Greek debt held by the ECB which matures this summer; if Europe\u2019s bailout funds stepped in and bought the bonds, it would spare Athens from borrowing more money simply to repay creditors. This could also include growth bonds, where repayments would be linked to GDP. 3) A debt brake, a pledge that Greece would never fall back into the primary deficits that caused the crisis in the first place. And he then outlines how the eurozone needs deep reforms, to finally complete the monetary union. We would sign up for that, he says, to avoid a repeat of the last few years. Yanis Varoufakis is now giving a familiar critique of the proposals from Greece\u2019s creditors. He says they prevented Greece\u2019s current government from making small reforms, insisting on a single big package agreed with lenders. And he argues that the budget surpluses being pushed by creditors are unreasonable, and would make it so much harder to return to growth. On pensions.... he agrees that the pension system in Greece isn\u2019t sustainable, but how can it be when a third of work is undeclared and the labour market is imploding? Of course the pension system is unsustainable, we want to reform it....Is cutting further a reform? I don\u2019t think so. Any butcher can chop something down. He also criticises the idea of hiking the tax on Greek electricity from 13% to 23% in a country beset by energy poverty, and to hike pharmacy costs. Imagine if I went to my parliament and said the way out of this crisis is cut a \u20ac350 pension by 40%, while raising the VAT on pharmaceuticals..... If you continue to squeeze our population into misery, we will not be reformable ever. We can carry the people , but not if we are made to force more austerity on them. We need an agreement quickly to avert an accident..... which history will take down as a failure of the political class of the European Union, including myself, Alexis Tsipras, Angela Merkel, Dr Sch\u00e4uble, Mr Juncker... We have an historic duty not to allow this to happen. Don\u2019t believe the idea that the eurozone is a story of hard-working ants in the north, and lazy grasshoppers in the south, Varoufakis says. There were hard working ants in Greece, just as in Germany, and they all suffered badly when the debt crisis began. Varoufakis also gives his audience in Berlin a chilling warning of the impact of the depression - a slump comparable with John Steinbeck and The Grapes of Wrath, he says Children are fainting from malnutrition in their clasrooms, and \u201cNazis, yes Nazis\u201d are coming out of the woodwork and onto the streets, he says. Yanis Varoufakis is explaining to his audience in Berlin how the creation of the eurozone created a \u2018tsunami of debt\u2019 from banks in Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam to Athens, Dublin and Madrid. This is the theory of \u2018surplus recycling\u2019, where cheap credit flowed to the eurozone periphery to create unsustainable borrowing levels. And the Greek finance minister insists that both sides are to blame. For every irresponsible borrower....there was an irresponsible lender. You can see Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s speech in Berlin live here. It\u2019s good stuff. One more thing to watch out for tonight: Yanis Varoufakis is now giving a speech in Berlin, at the Boeckler Foundation. Yanis\u2019s rock star persona hasn\u2019t been dented by the last five months; a group of anti-austerity protesters gathered outside the event: Time for a recap. A series of world leaders have piled pressure on Greece to make compromises to secure bailout funds from its creditors, as the eurozone enters one of its most crucial weeks in years. President Obama told world media at the G7 summit that Greece must show it is serious, adding: \u201cThe Greeks are going to have to follow through and make some tough political choices that will be good for them long-term.\u201d Obama did also urge the international community to recognise \u201cthe extraordinary challenges\u201d that Greece faces, but made it clear that prime minister Alexis Tsipras must implement economic reforms. The Greek crisis loomed over the G7 summit in Germany, three days after prime minister Tsipras blasted creditors for trying to force Greece into unacceptable measures. German chancellor Angela Merkel warned that time is running out for Greece, and cautioned that the country must implement measures sought by lenders. Importantly, Merkel also confirmed she would speak with Tsipras at the EU-Latin American summit on Wednesday President Hollande sounded more conciliatory, but also urged a deal ahead of the final deadline of 30 June. Despite Tsipras\u2019s tough talk in parliament on Friday night, there were signs today that Athens was softening. It sent two top ministers to negotiate in Brussels today, as a government spokesman pledged that Greece wants a solution that suits both sides. Greek media are reporting that Athens is rejigging its 47-page list of reforms, but remains opposed to making significant changes to VAT and pensions. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis also tried to mend relations with Germany, on a visit to his counterpart Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble for a \u201cvery helpful\u201d chat. Varoufakis told reporters in Berlin that: \u201cDr Sch\u00e4uble and I had a long productive conversation....We were not negotiating, we were establishing common ground.\u201d Varoufakis also warned that policymakers have a \u2018historic duty\u2019 to solve the crisis: \u201cThese are difficult moments for the European Union and the euro zone in particular and it is the duty of elected politicians to take their responsibility to a higher level in order to try to achieve an agreement that is absolutely essential for the integrity of the euro zone, absolutely essential for the European Union and it is a historic duty which we cannot abrogate.\u201d But this didn\u2019t stop the Athens stock market hitting a six-week low tonight. That\u2019s probably all for today, but I\u2019ll pop back into the blog if there are any major developments.... GW Europe\u2019s stock markets just closed with losses across the board. The German DAX, French CAC, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB all fell around 1%, which confirms that the DAX is now in \u2018correction\u2019 territory (down 10% on April\u2019s record high). Analysts believe the selloff is partly due to Greek angst, and partly due to other factors such as the rising euro and bond market volatility. CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson says: European markets have continued where they left off at the end of last week, as rising bond yields and the continued impasse over a new Greece deal keep investors cautious. The absence of a Greek deal is fuelling fears over the stability of its banking sector. Rating agency Moody\u2019s warned today that bank deposits must have fallen again in May, on top of the \u20ac4.9bn that fled the sector in April. And this \u201csignificantly increases the risk\u201d that capital controls will be imposed, they say in a new report [on the very day that Iceland announces plans to lift its own controls]. As Moody\u2019s explains: Such capital controls could be in the form of restrictions on deposit withdrawals, such as imposing a daily limit on how much cash depositors can withdraw and on money transfers abroad. This could even by triggered by the European Central Bank, which is providing over \u20ac80bn of emergency liquidity: The ECB may indirectly prompt capital controls by limiting the extension of ELA to Greek banks, with an aim to exert pressure on the Greek government to come to an agreement with its official lenders regarding its financing programme. And as our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports, savers are on edge.... Deposits last week dropped below \u20ac130bn euro \u2013 effectively wiping out the savings of the last 11 years, according to officials in the sector. At the height of the crisis in mid-2012, when scenarios of euro zone exit were at their loudest and withdrawals dramatic, deposits stood at \u20ac150bn. In April, alone, companies and households withdrew almost \u20ac5bn from the system \u2013 reinforcing fears of a full-scale bank run if Greece doesn\u2019t manage to seal a deal with the EU and IMF before its bailout expires on June 30. And Greece\u2019s minister of labour, Panos Skourletis, told Mega TV this morning that some bank officials are apparently advising savers to withdraw holdings from account. He referred to: ...what we are all hearing of banks advising [savers] to withdraw money abroad through mutual funds.\u201d Non-performing loans have also skyrocketed \u2013 peaking at \u20ac80bn last week an all time high. Bank officials this morning were cautioning against being overly pessimistic. One insider at the Bank of Greece told us: \u201cEverything is going swimmingly. People are very calm and actually cautiously optimistic\u201d That\u2019s hard to believe however when you look at the figures...... Christian Noyer of the European Central Bank has made some eye-catching comments on Greece, at an event in Montreal today. On the one hand, a Grexit wouldn\u2019t be a disaster for Europe: ECB\u2019S NOYER: GREEK EXIT, IF IT WERE TO HAPPEN, WOULD NOT CAUSE INSTABILITY FOR EURO ZONE; SITUATION IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN SEVERAL YEARS AGO ECB\u2019S NOYER: FIREWALLS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO PLACE ARE EXTREMELY POWERFUL, EUROPEAN ECONOMIES ARE ON THE RISE On the other...we really do need a deal soon! ECB\u2019S NOYER: PROBLEM OF GREECE IS A PROBLEM FOR GREECE ITSELF; \u201cI AM ANXIOUS FOR GREECE\u201d; PROBLEM IS FOR GREECE TO RESTART THEIR ECONOMY AND PURSUE REFORMS ECB\u2019S NOYER: IT\u2019S EXTREMELY URGENT FOR GREECE TO REACH A SETTLEMENT; \u201cIT\u2019S A MATTER OF DAYS\u201d And thus, it\u2019s Greece that needs to compromise.... ECB\u2019S NOYER: HAVEN\u2019T SEEN CONVINCING SET OF PROPOSALS ON GREECE (thanks to Reuters for the news flashes) Investors in Athens are feeling the heat. The main ATG index slid 2.7% today, closing at its lowest level in six weeks. Financial stocks were hit, again, with Piraeus Bank shedding 7.3% and Alpha Bank down 5.3%. Obama is also touching on data hacking and the Middle East: President Barack Obama is also taking questions at the G7 now, and the first question is on the Greek crisis. Are European governments being too tough on Greece? Obama replies that he believes the G7 partners, the IM and other institutions feel \u201ca sense of urgency\u201d towards finding a path to resolve the situation. \u201cIt is going to require Greece being serious about making some important reforms\u201d, says Obama, adding: Not only to satisfy creditors, but also to create a platform where the Greek economy can start growing again and prospering. And Obama then gives Athens a clear nudge: The Greeks are going to have to follow through and make some tough political choices that will be good for them long-term. But the institutions also need to do their bit and recognise the \u201cextraordinary\u201d challenges Greece faces, Obama adds. In conclusion: If both sides show sufficient flexibility, we can get this problem resolved....but it will need tough decisions from all involved. Can we get a deal before the deadline? Obama says he believes there is a real desire for progress: I think that everyone wants to make it happen and they\u2019re working hard to get it done. So, a clear signal from Washington that this deadlock needs to be broken. Obama also denies that he told other world leaders he was worried about the strength of the US dollar (as one newswire reported this morning). Here\u2019s Francois Hollande\u2019s warning about on the urgent need to get a Greek deal, from Reuters: \u201cThere is an end-June deadline..... \u201cThis is the latest possible deadline but nothing stops us from going faster and I think it is in Greece\u2019s interest to go faster to avoid doubts or speculations. If we want - and all of us, Greeks and Europeans, have said we do - Greece to stay in the euro zone, we must go towards a solution in a timeframe that is not (as late as) the end of the month.\u201d Across the G7 summit, French president Francois Hollande has just told reporters that there is still time to reach a deal with Greece. Reuters has the details: FRANCE\u2019S HOLLANDE SAYS WE NEED TO HAVE IN COMING HOURS OR DAYS TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS ON GREECE TO MAKE PROGRESS FRANCE\u2019S HOLLANDE SAYS END-JUNE IS THE LAST POSSIBLE DEADLINE ON GREECE My colleague Andrew Sparrow has full details of Merkel\u2019s press conference here. A second reporter asks Angela Merkel about Greece -- are G7 leaders worried that the country might default soon? The German chancellor insists that \u201cEveryone around the table wants Greece to say in the euro\u2026.but we have rules.\u201d Merkel cites the recovery in Ireland, and the progress in Cyprus, as proof that reform measures pushed by Greece\u2019s lenders can work. She also points to Ukraine, which faces extremely taxing structural reforms in return for its IMF bailout. Some early reaction to Merkel\u2019s comments on Greece: Angela Merkel has warned that \u201cevery day counts\u201d in the race to finalise a deal with Greece. She is asked whether the Greek crisis was debated at the G7 summit, with reference to American worries that a Grexit could prompt a Lehman Brothers-style crisis. The German chancellor replied that Greece was discussed - although not for very long -- with regards to the state of the eurozone. Those G7 members who are not in the eurozone also wanted to know the score, she said. She downplayed the comparison with Lehman Brothers, and explained: \u201cAll I can say now is that we want Greece to remain part of the eurozone\u201d....but \u201csolidarity between European countries and with Greece means Greece will have to implement measures\u201d. There is a common position between the three Institutions (the IMF, ECB and EU), and discussions are based on that, she says. And then Merkel warned that \u201cthere isn\u2019t much time left\u201d to get a deal. The day after tomorrow we can discuss this with the Greek prime minister at the EU summit with Latin American countries... Every day counts to complete the necessary job. The G7 summit has broken up, and leaders are speaking to the media now. Angela Merkel\u2019s press conference is being streamed here. Iceland\u2019s government insists that its plan to relax capital controls is sensible. Officials at today\u2019s press conference are stressing that it will bring \u201cstability\u201d, and allow money to move freely again without drastic moves that hurt the economy. The plan is part of the Icelandic governments plan to move on from the financial crisis, which saw its over-leveraged banking sector collapse once the credit crunch struck. At first glance, there are two key elements to the plan: Investors with assets in its failed banks must pay a 39% tax to access the funds (which are currently locked down). Overseas investors who hold kr\u00f3na can exchange them for other currencies through an auction, or buy long-term Treasury bonds, or put the money into \u201clocked non-interest-bearing accounts\u201d. Anyone choosing to swap their kr\u00f3na for foreign currencies must pay a premium, to prevent a surge of money that could destabilise the currency. Despite Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s criticism of Greece yesterday, the Commission hasn\u2019t given up hopes of a Greek deal either. Spokesman Margaritis Schinas explained told a press conference today that the EC will \u201ccontinue working on a solution\u201d....but with its own proposals as the starting point. Schinas said: \u201cThe proposal submitted by the institutions last week was a good basis for discussion provided that all sides are dedicated to finding a solution to the open issues.\u201d Over in Reykjavik, the Icelandic authorities are announcing plans to lift capital controls imposed after the financial crisis. There\u2019s a livefeed here. I\u2019ll summarise the key points shortly.... Greek government spokesman Gavriil Sakellaridis also revealed this morning that two senior ministers are heading up negotiations in Brussels today. Another sign of compromise? State Minister Nikos Pappas and Alternate Foreign Minister Euclid Tsakalotos are leading the government\u2019s delegation to the Belgian capital. Pappas is a close ally of prime minister Tsipras, while Tsakalotos has day-to-day charge of the negotiations. There\u2019s a rumour that they could see Pierre Moscovici, commissioner for economic and financial affairs, this afternoon, reports Kathimerini\u2019s Elena Varvitsiotis. I flagged up earlier that Greece is reportedly revising its proposal to creditors, although perhaps not giving much ground on the crucial issue of pensions. Greece is determined to keep negotiating with its creditors over the the next few weeks to get a deal, says government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis. While Varoufakis was speaking with Sch\u00e4uble, Sakellaridis was striking a conciliatory tone with reporters in Athens. \u201cDefinitely our proposal is the starting point,\u201d Sakellaridis told a news conference, adding: \u201cThe mission of the Greek delegation is to explore the possibility of a solution that satisfies both sides.\u201d According to Sakellaridis, Greece\u2019s is committed to having \u201ca lot of political negotiations\u201d through June to ensure a \u201cpositive outcome\u201d to talks. And he suggested that Greece\u2019s negotiators in Brussels could make progress this week: Meanwhile in the UK, rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned that David Cameron\u2019s plan for an in/out referendum on EU membership could hurt Britain\u2019s credit rating. In a new report, Moody\u2019s said that an early vote would raise the chances of Brexit. It says: \u201cIn Moody\u2019s view, a shorter time frame increases the risk that the UK government will not manage to secure the changes that it is seeking, which in turn may negatively influence the government\u2019s willingness to support remaining in the EU,\u201d the agency says in an update on the UK. \u201cWhile the outcome of the referendum remains uncertain, Moody\u2019s believes that a withdrawal from the EU would have negative implications for the UK\u2019s growth prospects and \u2013 in the absence of an alternative trade arrangement with the EU that at least partly replicates the current access to the EU\u2019s single market \u2013 would likely put pressure on the UK\u2019s sovereign rating.\u201d Full story: Yanis Varoufakis also told reports that the meeting with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble was helpful, and held in an \u201cextremely friendly\u201d manner (Dow Jones reports). Yanis Varoufakis has just emerged from his meeting with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. He tells reporters that they have held \u201cfriendly and productive\u201d talks this morning. But were any concessions made, the press pack ask. We didn\u2019t negotiate, Varoufakis says (via Natalie Bachmayer of Germany TV channel ARD) Europe\u2019s stock markets remain edgy this morning, as Brenda Kelly of London Capital Group explains: With Greek worries still haunting investors with the European Commissioner stating that alternative proposals must be found if a deal is to come to fruition. It\u2019s the last day and yet the G7 leaders have yet to reach a compromise that unlocks bailout aid for Greece. and until accord is reached we can expect market jitters to continue. Yanis Varoufakis has just been sighted in Berlin, arriving for his talks with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble (preview here) Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has arrived at the G7 summit. According to one official, she\u2019s likely to discuss the Greek crisis during today\u2019s session (which will also cover global security threats from ISIS to the Ukraine conflict) US President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande have already held a bilateral meeting: Greek newspaper Kathimerini is reporting that the Athens government is redrafting its own bailout proposals today, in the hope of cracking a deal soon. However, it\u2019s only inching towards a compromise, rather than swallowing its creditors demands (not surprising, given the way Alexis Tsipras dismissed them on Friday night). Here\u2019s a flavour: Kathimerini understands that Athens is focussing its attention on adjusting the fiscal measures it proposed with the aim of getting closer to the revenue target set by lenders. However, the coalition is reluctant to adjust its VAT proposal, which sees three brackets (6, 11 and 23 percent) rather than the two proposed by lenders (11 and 23). Greece also seems prepared to raise slightly its primary surplus proposals from 0.6 percent of GDP this year and 1.5 percent next year. The institutions proposed 1 percent for 2015 and 2 percent for 2016. The updated suggestion from the Greek side is not expected to reach these targets. While Athens is prepared to change the law regarding early retirement, saving 100 million euros, it does not seem willing to go as far as lenders are demanding in terms of pension reform. There are also substantial differences between Greece and its creditors on the issue of labour market regulations. More here: Greece updating proposals it sent to lenders in hope of clinching deal The Greek crisis continues to drag on European stock markets this morning, pulling the German DAX and French CAC down by over 0.6%. And that means the DAX is officially in \u2018correction territory\u2019; having shed more than 10% since hitting a record high on 10 April. It\u2019s not all Greece\u2019s fault; German shares had soared as the euro weakened earlier this year, but that\u2019s been reversed as the eurozone emerged from its brief dose of negative inflation. Recent volatility in the bond markets has also hit shares. But German investors ought to be feeling more confident this morning. Factories orders have risen for the second month running, 1.4% in April, as demand from other eurozone nations picks up. Greek TV stations are reporting that relations between Berlin and Washington have turned increasingly frosty, as Barack Obama pushes fellow G7 leaders for a quick solution to the crisis. From Athens, Helena Smith reports Citing a senior German official, Greek television channel Mega TV described how US Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew had implored his German counterpart Wolfgang Schauble to \u201csupport Greece\u201d -- only to be told: \u201cgive \u20ac50bn yourself to save Greece. Mega\u2019s Berlin-based correspondent told the station that: \u201cWhereupon the US official said nothing because, as if always the case according to German officials when it comes to the issue of money, the Americans never say anything\u201d. Meanwhile, negotiations between Greece and Berlin are expected to intensify Monday when the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis meets Schauble in the German capital. The Greek politician, who will be in Berlin to give a speech, requested the meeting late Friday and is expected to try and smooth over some of the fall-out from what Athens\u2019 leftist led government regards as \u201cincendiary\u201d remarks by the Grecophile EU president Jean-Claude Juncker. But government ministers remain defiant. \u201cThe lenders are trying to rip Greece apart,\u201d said the hardliner energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis adding that while it was not the choice of the governing far left Syriza party to take the country out of the euro zone, neither could it allow \u201cthe extinction of Greece\u201d within the euro zone. France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, has fired a warning shot at Athens this morning by claiming the impact of Greece leaving the eurozone would be pretty trivial. Speaking on RTL radio, Sapin said he expects a deal in time - but appeared sanguine about the prospect of failure. \u201cIt would be no drama for us to see Greece leaving the euro. It would not be serious from a financial or economic point of view\u201d \u201cHowever, it would be a blow to the European project, because the European project is not to shrink but to enlarge, not to see members excluded but to welcome more.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) Today\u2019s meeting was requested by the Greek side; Yanis Varoufakis is in Berlin to attend another event this evening, so decided to take advantage of this opportunity to visit Sch\u00e4uble at the same time. It\u2019s an opportunity to repair relations between Greece and the creditors after Tsipras\u2019s defiant speech to MPs on Friday night..... ...Varoufakis, though, has already echoed his leader\u2019s attack on the creditors this weekend, as AFP explains: Greece\u2019s Varoufakis to meet German finance minister Monday Germany\u2019s Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble will meet Monday in Berlin with his Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis, amid contentious negotiations between Greece and its creditors, the German ministry said. A ministry spokesman told AFP the meeting would take place \u201cin the morning\u201d and that no press conference was planned. Varoufakis is in Germany to take part in a debate Monday evening in Berlin organised by Hans-Bloeckler foundation, close to the German union confederation DGB, while a summit of G7 leaders wraps up in Bavaria in southern Germany. On Sunday Greece and the European Union traded barbs over Brussels\u2019 latest demands for economic reforms by Athens, with EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker accusing Greece\u2019s premier of misrepresenting the proposals that Athens has termed \u201cabsurd\u201d. Varoufakis was quoted in the Greek press calling the proposals \u201cborderline insulting\u201d. \u201cIt was an aggressive move designed to terrorise the Greek government,\u201d Varoufakis told Proto Thema daily. Greece\u2019s radical-left government and its creditors - the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and European Central Bank - have been negotiating for five months on reforms needed to unlock 7.2 billion euros ($8 billion) in remaining rescue funds that Athens desperately needs to meet a series of debt repayments to the IMF this month. We have a new deadline to aim for: France wants a Greek deal by Sunday. That would give enough time for eurozone finance ministers to rubber-stamp a plan at their next eurogroup meeting, on June 18th. But after so many deadlines, can we put much faith in this one? Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears over Greece\u2019s financial plight are building this morning, as we enter a crucial week for Athens and the rest of Europe. Greece now has barely three weeks to strike a deal with creditors, and get it agreed, before its bailout extension expires on 30 June. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is due to meet with his Germany counterpart, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, in Berlin this morning to discuss events, at the start of a period of urgent diplomacy. But relations between Greece and its creditors look increasingly strained, after Alexis Tsipras\u2019s performance in parliament on Friday night. European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker tore into Tsipras yesterday, saying the Greek PM was wrong to tell his MPs that creditors had imposed \u2018absurd\u2019 ultimatums. Instead, Juncker told reporters at the G7 summit that lenders were disappointed in the Greek side, saying: Alexis Tsipras promised that by Thursday evening he would present a second proposal. Then he said he would present it on Friday. And then he said he would call on Saturday. But I have never received that proposal, so I hope I will receive it soon. I would like to have that Greek proposal,. And in a sign that Tsipas\u2019s speech has backfired, Juncker criticised him for failing to mention the EC\u2019s willingness to negotiate over Greek pensions: \u201cI do not have a personal problem with Alexis Tsipras. He was my friend. He is my friend \u2026 But frankly, in order to maintain [the friendship], he has to observe some minimum rules.\u201d The G7 summit continues today, so we may hear more about Greece. Also coming up.... Iceland is expected to announce the end of capital controls today, almost seven years after imposing restrictions on the flow of money when the financial crisis erupted. An announcement is due at 1pm BST. And Turkey\u2019s financial markets are in some turmoil after yesterday\u2019s shock general election result: The lira slumped 5% to a new record low this morning, and shares in Istanbul tumbled 8% in early trading. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events in Greece and beyond through the day....",

A brief mention in a Brazilian publication of takeover interest by local billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann and his 3G Capital outfit pushed the Guinness-to-Smirnoff maker\u2019s share price up 7%. The frothy madness of modern markets at work? Only up a point. The bid story was gloriously thin on detail but it contains two ingredients of all good takeover speculation. First, the would-be bidder has an appetite for deals. Lemann and 3G were the prime movers behind the mega-merger of brewers Anheuser-Busch and Interbrew of Belgium, and also snaffled Heinz. Second, the would-be target \u2013 Diageo \u2013 suddenly looks as if it has run out of ways to grow. Under Paul Walsh, chief executive until 2013, Diageo was a supreme marketing machine, consistently selling higher volumes of spirits. This happy knack seems to have been lost in the last year under Ivan Menezes, Walsh\u2019s former chief operating officer. Trading has disappointed for at least three quarters. Explanations have, of course, be offered. Markets have been tough, especially in Asia, and Menezes has been trying to adopt what he calls a \u201csell out culture,\u201d in other words not overloading distribution channels with stock. The two-year share graph, however, says investors are not wholly convinced: Diageo hit \u00a320 in 2013 but was \u00a317 before Monday. Nor has the lengthy takeover of United Spirits raised morale; that business seems full of short-term headaches, whatever the long-term appeal. Analysts can envisage all manner of possible deals involving Lemann and/or AB InBev. But, for Menezes and Diageo, there\u2019s a simple lesson to draw from the credibility afforded the takeover rumour. The best defence against a bid is to run the business well and outsiders think Diageo could run harder. Deutsche shakeout at last For official consumption, Anshu Jain and J\u00fcrgen Fitschen have behaved decently and commendably by volunteering to step down as co-chief executives of Deutsche Bank. The rest of the world knows the harder version of events. Deutsche has been infuriating its shareholders for years, clocking up huge fines for past bad behaviour while cutting costs at snail\u2019s pace. A 40% vote against management at last month\u2019s annual meeting illustrated the depth of investors\u2019 loss of confidence. A pillar of the German financial establishment does not suffer rebellions of that scale unless something has gone seriously wrong. Deutsche\u2019s management, however, reacted to the vote by handing even power to Jain. That decision simply wasn\u2019t credible. Much credit should go to Hermes, the UK activist fund manager, which has argued loudly that changing Deutsche\u2019s culture would require the ditching of two long-serving chiefs. Its foot-dragging in dealings with regulators was an illustration of the malaise. Consider Monday\u2019s 5% relief rally in Deutsche\u2019s share price a vindication of everything Hermes has been saying. Last act of an Indonesian farce Never again, vowed Nat Rothschild as he bowed out of his ill-fated adventure into Indonesian coal that traded for most of its miserable life as Bumi. NR Holdings, his investment vehicle, is accepting the 56p-a-share offer for the renamed Asia Resources Minerals from Asia Coal Energy Ventures. \u201cThis will be our first and last investment in Indonesian\u2019s coal sector,\u201d said Rothschild. At the final hour, he secured a few extra pennies on the take-out price. In every other respect, though, this saga has been an embarrassment from start to finish \u2013 for him, for his backers and for the London stock market. Bumi was imagined as commodities conglomerate, an mini-Xstrata in the making. It would snap up under-appreciated resources in emerging markets and impose western-style corporate governance. Nice idea, but there was a flaw at the outset: the London-listed company only even had a 29% stake in its main Indonesian assets. When relations with the local Bakrie family broke down amid bitter allegations of mismanagement and worse, Rothschild and Bumi were never able to get their way. Feuds, and an ever-changing cast of Indonesian tycoons, added to the sense of farce. Rothschild fought vested Indonesian interests and lost. A sliding thermal coal price didn\u2019t help either. Rothschild is rich enough to take the personal hit, possibly \u00a380m. It\u2019s hard, though, to imagine he\u2019ll ever again be able to raise \u00a3700m from investors to pursue a foreign adventure, even if it\u2019s miles away from Indonesia.",

      "bodyText": "Greeks need to make some \u201csome tough political choices\u201d over the coming weeks, Barack Obama said on Monday in a clear warning to Athens that its team of negotiators must compromise further to secure a debt deal with the creditors. The US president said there was a \u201csense of urgency\u201d to resolve the situation, despite officials on both sides saying the two sides remain far apart on pension reforms and the projected size of the Greek budget deficit. \u201cWhat it\u2019s going to require is Greece being serious about making some important reforms,\u201d Obama said. The Greeks, he added, would have to \u201cmake some tough political choices that will be good for the long term\u201d. Speaking at the G7 summit in Elmau, Germany, Obama also stressed that the international community should \u201crecognise the extraordinary challenges that Greeks face, and if both sides are showing sufficient flexibility, then I think we can get this problem resolved\u201d. Greek bailout negotiators are expected to deliver a redrafted programme of reforms to a meeting of creditors on Tuesday, though few close to the talks believe it will dramatically close the gap with rival proposals put forward by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Central Bank (ECB) and the European commission. At the weekend, the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, angrily accused Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, of reneging on a promise to deliver a fresh reform programme after Athens\u2019 efforts at compromise were rejected. Juncker, who was entrusted with managing high-level political discussions with Tsipras while world leaders prepared for the summit, said on Sunday that he had waited in vain for a call from Tsipras to say a new proposal was on its way. \u201cI would like to have that Greek proposal,\u201d he said. Stock markets interpreted the renewed war of words cautiously, with all the main European exchanges losing ground. The FTSE 100 slipped to 6,790 points, down 0.2%, while the German Dax and French CAC dropped more than 1% to 11,064 and 4,857 respectively. A report by the rating agency Moody\u2019s heightened fears that Greece was heading for a eurozone exit after it forecast a near \u20ac5bn (\u00a33,7bn) loss of deposits in May. A run on its banks could be the prelude to the imposition of capital controls to stem a further outflow of funds. A spokesman for the Greek government sought to allay fears that Greece was edging closer to an exit from the single currency, saying that differences with international creditors were being addressed seriously. With Greece facing an end-of-month deadline to secure a deal, a government spokesman, Gabriel Sakellaridis, said negotiators were in Brussels to explore the \u201cscope for convergence\u201d with creditors and indicated there was room for negotiation. He also sought to douse talk that any deal would trigger an election in Greece, saying it was not something the government was considering. Some ministers had raised the issue as an option if a deal cannot be reached. A resolution is needed by 30 June, when Greece\u2019s bailout programme ends and the last tranche of \u20ac7.2bn in rescue loans, held up since January, will no longer be available. Without the funds, Greece cannot repay its debts and could then end up crashing out of Europe\u2019s currency bloc. Last week Tsipras rejected as illogical a \u201cfinal offer\u201d from creditors. But in what appeared to be a coordinated effort by G7 leaders to cool the political temperature ahead of further talks, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that while Greece\u2019s euro partners want the country to remain in the eurozone, Athens had to do its part by implementing reforms. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of time, that\u2019s the problem, that\u2019s why we have to work as intensively as possible,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cEveryone at the table wants Greece to stay in the eurozone,\u201d said Merkel. \u201cBut as I said ... we have rules.\u201d Sakellaridis reiterated that Greece considered its proposals in a 47-page document, delivered by Tsipras during a visit to Brussels last week, to be the basis for a deal. Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank said there appears little room for manoeuvre \u2013 noting that hardliners within the Greek government \u201cmay oppose almost any condition which lenders must attach to the disbursement of money\u201d. On the lenders\u2019 side, he said \u201cthe IMF and to a lesser extent the ECB seem to be against any further concessions\u201d.",

The Greeks, he added, would have to \u201cmake some tough political choices that will be good for the long term\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/07/juncker-fury-greek-bailout-talks-g7-summit-russia-sanctions\">Juncker vents fury over Greek bailout talks at G7 summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking at the G7 summit in Elmau<strong>, </strong>Germany, Obama also stressed that the international community should \u201crecognise the extraordinary challenges that Greeks face, and if both sides are showing sufficient flexibility, then I think we can get this problem resolved\u201d.</p> <p>Greek bailout negotiators are expected to deliver a redrafted programme of reforms to a meeting of creditors on Tuesday, though few close to the talks believe it will dramatically close the gap with rival proposals put forward by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Central Bank (ECB) and the European commission.</p> <p>At the weekend, the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, angrily accused Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, of reneging on a promise to deliver a fresh reform programme after Athens\u2019 efforts at compromise were rejected.</p> <p>Juncker, who was entrusted with managing high-level political discussions with Tsipras while world leaders prepared for the summit, said on Sunday that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/07/juncker-fury-greek-bailout-talks-g7-summit-russia-sanctions\">he had waited in vain for a call from Tsipras</a> to say a new proposal was on its way.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to have that Greek proposal,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Stock markets interpreted the renewed war of words cautiously, with all the main European exchanges losing ground. The FTSE 100 slipped to 6,790 points, down 0.2%, while the German Dax and French CAC dropped more than 1% to 11,064 and 4,857 respectively.</p> <p>A report by the rating agency Moody\u2019s heightened fears that Greece was heading for a eurozone exit after it forecast a near \u20ac5bn (\u00a33,7bn) loss of deposits in May. A run on its banks could be the prelude to the imposition of capital controls to stem a further outflow of funds.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Greek government sought to allay fears that Greece was edging closer to an exit from the single currency, saying that differences with international creditors were being addressed seriously.</p> <p>With Greece facing an end-of-month deadline to secure a deal, a government spokesman, Gabriel Sakellaridis, said negotiators were in Brussels to explore the \u201cscope for convergence\u201d with creditors and indicated there was room for negotiation.</p> <p>He also sought to douse talk that any deal would trigger an election in Greece, saying it was not something the government was considering. Some ministers had raised the issue as an option if a deal cannot be reached.</p> <p>A resolution is needed by 30 June, when Greece\u2019s bailout programme ends and the last tranche of \u20ac7.2bn in rescue loans, held up since January, will no longer be available. Without the funds, Greece cannot repay its debts and could then end up crashing out of Europe\u2019s currency bloc.</p> <p>Last week Tsipras rejected as illogical a \u201cfinal offer\u201d from creditors.</p> <p>But in what appeared to be a coordinated effort by G7 leaders to cool the political temperature ahead of further talks, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that while Greece\u2019s euro partners want the country to remain in the eurozone, Athens had to do its part by implementing reforms.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of time, that\u2019s the problem, that\u2019s why we have to work as intensively as possible,\u201d Merkel said.<br></p> <p>\u201cEveryone at the table wants Greece to stay in the eurozone,\u201d said Merkel. \u201cBut as I said ... we have rules.\u201d<br><br>Sakellaridis reiterated that Greece considered its proposals in a 47-page document, delivered by Tsipras during a visit to Brussels last week, to be the basis for a deal.</p> <p>Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank said there appears little room for manoeuvre \u2013 noting that hardliners within the Greek government \u201cmay oppose almost any condition which lenders must attach to the disbursement of money\u201d. </p> <p>On the lenders\u2019 side, he said \u201cthe IMF and to a lesser extent the ECB seem to be against any further concessions\u201d.<br></p>",

    "webTitle": "US carriers drive record global profits for airline industry", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Airlines are making more profits than ever before, boosted by lower fuel prices and carrying more passengers on fuller planes, according to the industry\u2019s global body. The International Air Transport Association said global profits will almost double to $29.3bn (\u00a319bn) in 2015, with American-based airlines having a particularly lucrative year on the back of a strong dollar. Iata\u2019s director general Tony Tyler said the industry was \u201ccollectively more profitable than at any time in our history\u201d but criticised George Osborne\u2019s demands that airlines cut fares because of falling oil prices. Tyler said that a 4% profit margin on expected revenues of $727bn owed much to \u201cfavourable but fragile\u201d conditions. Half of the global profits will be generated in North America \u2013 although international competitors were suffering from the dollar\u2019s sharp rise against most global currencies, offsetting potential savings on fuel. Brent crude oil is forecast to average $66 a barrel this year compared with $101 in 2014. Yet Tyler insisted that far more than the fuel price was responsible for the changing fortunes, saying: \u201cThe strongest driver is efficiency: airlines are filling more seats\u201d with load factors, or the proportion of occupied seats, reaching 82.7%. He warned that European aviation still faced a \u201cquadruple whammy\u201d of faltering economies, high taxes, onerous regulation and the slow progress in co-ordinating European airspace. Tyler took a swipe at the UK chancellor whohas called for airlines to cut fares in the light of cheaper oil. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that some politicians wrongly interpret hard-earned financial sustainability ... No politician is asking for iPad prices to fall,\u201d Tyler said. He said Osborne should instead abolish air passenger duty, which he described as \u201cthe most stringent air passenger tax in the world, it\u2019s unnecessary and bad for the UK economy. Once the Scottish authorities have powers to abolish it [England] will be even more isolated. It\u2019s such a no-brainer, I don\u2019t why he hasn\u2019t already.\u201d The Iata chief said he was pessimistic that the Airports Commission\u2019s impending verdict would lead to action on expanding London\u2019s airport capacity. He said the debate was \u201cbuffeted by politics and parochial interests\u201d. \u201cIf we can get past those hurdles, challenging and time consuming debates on funding and regulation are bound to follow.\u201c Brian Pearce, chief economist of Iata, said that airlines would be transporting goods worth $6,000bn, around 35% of all world trade. Aviation will now be employing 2.5 million people \u2013 back above pre-2001 levels, with the industry having seen a huge downturn after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US. Many of those jobs now are on considerably worse terms and conditions. The burgeoning profits of American airlines have not been unremarked: catering workers supplying inflight meals were outside the Iata summit to call for a nickel on ticket prices to boost wages that are now lower in dollars per hour than in 2001. Tyler meanwhile tried to contain the growing row between Gulf airlines and American carriers, telling the summit meeting in Miami that Iata was \u201cnot the battleground on which any resolution will be achieved\u201d. United and American Airlines have called on the US government to investigate alleged unfair state subsidy and limit the rights of Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways to operate in the US. However, his attempt to dodge the row was denounced by Akbar Al-Baker, the chief executive of Qatar Airways and a Heathrow airport board member, who warned that the American carriers risked starting a wider trade war between the US and the Gulf states. He said that the move would \u201clead to retaliatory protectionism affecting all aspects of trade\u201d. Doug Parker,chief executive of American Airlines, who is chairing the summit, tried to deflect the row, saying: \u201cOur dispute is not with those three airlines. We\u2019re just trying to get the US government to enforce its trade policies.\u201d But, he warned: \u201cWe expect that they will take some action in the future.\u201d Meanwhile, Tyler insisted that \u201cflying has never been safer\u201d despite the three major aviation disasters of the last 15 months. While the twin Malaysian disasters of MH370 and MH17 and the crash of Germanwings 9525 had driven constant headlines, Iata figures showed that 2014, with only one \u201chull loss\u201d (or major crash) for every 4.4m flights worldwide, was statistically the safest to date. Tyler said the industry was still making progress in addressing the safety issues raised, including more regular tracking of aircraft. He said that Iata was continuing to push for a global convention on controlling anti-aircraft missiles after MH17 was apparently shot down over eastern Ukraine by rebel soldiers. But he warned that the industry would be limited in its response to Germanwings 9525 \u2013 \u201ca deliberate and horrible act by one of our own\u201d \u2013 saying \u201cthere is no immunity to mental health issues\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Christopher Bailey, the fashion designer who was put in charge of the luxury label Burberry last year, could be given shares worth up to \u00a350m from free handouts and shares awarded for bonuses over the coming years. Details of the huge potential rewards were revealed as the fashion group attempted to prevent a shareholder revolt over boardroom pay by issuing a detailed explanation of the \u00a38m in shares and cash paid to Bailey last year. The luxury retailer, known for its trademark beige check, admitted it had not previously given a \u201csufficiently clear\u201d explanation of Bailey\u2019s remuneration. The company was responding to shareholders\u2019 concerns after last year\u2019s AGM, when 52.7% voted against the pay deal for Bailey, who had just been appointed to replace Angela Ahrendts after her departure to become Apple\u2019s retail boss. Burberry\u2019s effort to appease investors comes before the AGM of WPP on Tuesday when the advertising company is also braced for a row over a \u00a343m pay deal for its boss, Sir Martin Sorrell. When Burberry promoted its designer Bailey to the role of chief executive, it allowed him to retain his previous title of chief creative \u2013 and some light was shed on his pay deals. But it was not until Burberry\u2019s annual report was published on Monday that the size of Bailey\u2019s shareholding was revealed. While he owns 300,000 shares outright, he could end up with more than 3m \u2013 worth almost \u00a350m at current share prices \u2013 from free awards and shares with performance criteria attached. In a letter to shareholders, Ian Carter, the non-executive director who chairs Burberry\u2019s remuneration committee, describes Bailey\u2019s importance to the company in the 14 years before he was installed as designer. \u201cOver that period, he led the creative side, overseeing everything the customer sees and touches including brand imagery, product design and development, creative marketing and architecture,\u201d said Carter, who is also president of Hilton Hotels. Carter admits that \u201cthe quantum and structure\u201d of Bailey\u2019s pay look unusual in a UK context. Bailey has a salary of \u00a31.1m as well as a \u00a3440,000 \u201ccash allowance\u201d, and in the 2014-15 financial year Bailey received a total of \u00a38m. That included \u00a34.4m from a longterm incentive plan together with his salary, allowance and annual bonus of \u00a31.7m. In the past he has been awarded shares in exceptional bonuses: 350,000 in 2010, which he will receive in the coming weeks; and in 2013, to stop him leaving, he was awarded 1m shares \u2013 worth \u00a315m. \u201cPut simply, the market value for his creative talent was far in excess of what he was earning,\u201d said Carter. The company also revealed that Bailey has agreed to increase his personal shareholding in the company by the time of this year\u2019s AGM on 16 July. He is to take immediate steps to increase his outright ownership to 500,000 shares. However, he will do this not by buying shares in the company \u2013 which change hands at about \u00a316.50 each \u2013 but by agreeing not to sell all 350,000 of the shares awarded to him in 2010. These are due to be handed over just before the AGM and he will keep half to \u201cdemonstrate his commitment to Burberry and alignment with shareholders\u201d. Bailey was also awarded 500,000 shares, which will be released to him between 2017 and 2019, when he was promoted last year. The company has now provided more detail about the performance criteria attached to these awards \u2013 a mixture of financial, strategic and personal targets. Carter said: \u201cChristopher Bailey is clearly in demand in the international luxury space and the board is delighted that he chosen to stay at Burberry\u201d. The annual report said that Bailey will not receive a rise in his salary this year but it also revealed that the new finance director Carol Fairweather had an 11% rise on her salary, to \u00a3500,000, last year. It also shows that Ahrendts \u2013 named as the highest paid woman in the US when she received $82.6m as a result of her signing-on fee from Apple \u2013 was paid \u00a3150,000 last year from Burberry under the terms of her departure package.",

Italian police are understood to have visited HSBC offices in connection with their broader enquiries into the affair.</p> <p>The revelation of HSBC\u2019s high-level internal investigation is the latest public embarrassment for Europe\u2019s largest bank, which is struggling to repair its reputation after a series of international scandals.</p> <p>Disclosure of HSBC\u2019s internal investigation comes amid renewed attention on HSBC\u2019s global presence which currently spans over 70 countries and as chief executive Stuart Gulliver outlines plans to simplify and withdraw from some of its operations worldwide.

      "bodyText": "HSBC has launched an investigation into one of its senior executives in connection with a major corporate scandal centred on deals made by Italy\u2019s largest insurer, the Guardian has learned. Stuart Levey, HSBC\u2019s chief legal officer, is understood to have ordered the inquiry into the current chief executive of the banking group\u2019s Italian operations. The small group of lawyers involved in the investigation, which has not been disclosed publicly, is examining the conduct of Marzio Perrelli, a former Goldman Sachs banker who joined HSBC\u2019s Italian subsidiary in 2004 and became its CEO in 2008. The Guardian understands the investigation is connected to a corporate scandal widely reported in the Italian press, involving the private equity dealings of the Generali insurance group. Italian police are understood to have visited HSBC offices in connection with their broader enquiries into the affair. The revelation of HSBC\u2019s high-level internal investigation is the latest public embarrassment for Europe\u2019s largest bank, which is struggling to repair its reputation after a series of international scandals. Disclosure of HSBC\u2019s internal investigation comes amid renewed attention on HSBC\u2019s global presence which currently spans over 70 countries and as chief executive Stuart Gulliver outlines plans to simplify and withdraw from some of its operations worldwide. Gulliver will present his latest strategy on Tuesday, and also set out the methodology by which the bank will decide whether to pull its headquarters from London, where it relocated from Hong Kong in 1992. In December 2012 HSBC received one of the biggest fines in banking history, $1.9bn (\u00a31.2bn), in a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice over facilitating money-laundering for Mexican drugs cartels. This was followed in February this year by the publication by an international consortium of news organisations \u2013 including the Guardian, BBC, Le Monde, Suddeutsche Zeitung and ICIJ \u2013 of evidence of HSBC\u2019s Swiss operation facilitating mass tax-avoidance and evasion. This has led to subsequent criminal probes in France, Belgium, Argentina and elsewhere. The bank has repeatedly and firmly stated that it has drastically reformed its management and compliance procedures since Stuart Gulliver took over as chief executive in 2011, and resisted claims it is \u201ctoo big to manage\u201d. In April the Guardian revealed HSBC is struggling to clean up parts of its worldwide operations after a senior executive told external lawyers that it is \u201ccast-iron certain\u201d it will face another major regulatory breach in the future, while last week it was reported the bank had launched an internal review over its alleged role in Fifa corruption. The Guardian contacted HSBC to give it an opportunity to comment on or amend the information that its chief lawyer was conducting an internal probe of the bank\u2019s Italian CEO in connection with Italy\u2019s criminal investigation of the Generali Group affair, and that HSBC executives had been summoned to give evidence to the internal panel. The bank declined to amend or challenge any of those specific points. \u201cWe have no comment on these allegations,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement. Last year, the Financial Times reported that Italian police raided HSBC\u2019s offices in Milan as part of an investigation into a complex financial deal involving the bank and Italy\u2019s largest insurance company, Generali. HSBC\u2019s spokesman refused to comment on whether the internal probe is related to the Italian police raid in February last year. HSBC\u2019s role in the unusual, multimillion-euro deal in 2007 \u2013 which involved Generali and a boutique private equity firm based in Vicenza \u2013 has been subject of reports in the Italian media in recent years. The deal is among a handful of investments made by Generali\u2019s former management which since 2013 have been scrutinised by both Italian authorities and the insurance company\u2019s new management. Writing in the Corriere della Sera newspaper in late 2012, the Italian senator and journalist Massimo Mucchetti wrote of the \u201cdark side of dealings\u201d between Generali and the private equity firm, called Palladio Finanziaria, whose CEO was sentenced last year over an unrelated bribery scandal. Mucchetti, along with others in the Italian press, reported that HSBC were involved in one of the deals now under scrutiny. It was reported earlier this year that Generali\u2019s former finance director faces an investigation by Italy\u2019s financial police, the Guardia di Finanza, over his alleged involvement in certain investment vehicles controlled by Generali. No individuals have been arrested or charged in connection with the investigation to date. Following the police raid on HSBC\u2019s offices in Milan last year, La Repubblica newspaper reported that Generali\u2019s new management had asked the bank for documents related to the 2007 deal between the bank and a Generali-controlled investment vehicle registered in the Bahamas. HSBC refused to hand over the documents, according to the report. The Guardian contacted Generali Group about the police investigation and allegations made in UK and Italian press.

      "bodyText": "Boots is axing 700 jobs in the UK as it implements a cost-cutting plan after its merger with the US drugstore chain Walgreens. The retailer said 700 \u201cnon-store based roles\u201d would go as part of a $1.5bn (\u00a31bn) cost-cutting plan set out in April. Some workers will be made redundant, while other jobs will be shed by not replacing people who leave or retire. Around 400 jobs are to go at a support office in Nottingham, while the rest are in other UK regions. The company was unable to say how many staff would be made redundant. The job losses are the most tangible impact of the \u00a39bn takeover by Walgreens. The US drugstore chain announced last year it was buying the 55% part of Alliance Boots it did not already own, having taken a 45% stake in 2012. Acting chief executive Stefano Pessina, who made \u00a34.45bn from the merger, is looking to cut costs as he upgrades Walgreens stores, which are perceived as more old-fashioned than Boots. In April, Walgreens announced it planned to make $1.5bn in cost savings by the end of 2017, up from an earlier estimate of $1bn. So far the cuts have fallen more heavily on the US-side of the business. Walgreens is closing 200 of its 8,000 stores and has frozen salaries for some of its top US executives. Walgreens had hoped to make even bigger savings by moving its headquarters to Europe, but was forced to drop the idea amid a political outcry in the US when President Barack Obama attacked \u201ccorporate deserters\u201d. Boots said it was \u201csimplifying the structure of support functions in order to provide a better level of service \u2026 and allow for a more focused investment in key areas to drive future growth. This will involve a reduction of around 700 non-store-based roles.\u201d When the takeover was announced in August, company sources had said Boots did not plan job losses and would keep its headquarters in Nottingham. Boots employs about 70,000 people at its 2,511 UK stores and traces its roots back to John Boot\u2019s herbalist store opened at Goose Gate, Nottingham in 1848. Simon Roberts, president of Boots, said the high-street chemist remained \u201cfully committed to our presence in Nottingham, which has been the home of Boots since the very beginning\u201d. \u201cWe have not taken these decisions lightly and understand the impact that today\u2019s announcement may have on our colleagues. We are fully committed to doing everything we can to support all our people as we transform Boots and strive to be even better for our customers and patients.\u201d",

The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) has 195 investors under investigation for potential breaches of the foreign investment rules regarding residential real estate. Of those, 24 are foreign investors who came forward voluntarily to flag they may have breached the laws. One of the foreign investors, from the UK, is negotiating with the government to divest a property purchased for about $700,000 in Western Australia.

Villa Del Mare was owned by one of China\u2019s richest men, the billionaire Xu Jiayin. He subsequently sold the house to businesswoman Lola Wang Li, in May, with a reported price tag of $41m.

In May, Hockey urged foreign investors to come forward ahead of a new regime of increased fines and criminal penalties to be introduced in December this year. Foreign investors who approach authorities before December will not face fines but will still be forced to divest. From 1 December, foreign residents who illegally invest in residential real estate face criminal penalties of up to $127,500 or three years\u2019 imprisonment for individuals and up to $637,500 for companies. The government will also introduce a civil penalty to stop foreign investors capturing any capital gain made on divestment of a property. Third parties who knowingly assist a foreign investor to breach the rules will also be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines of $45,000 for individuals and $225,000 for companies.

October 2008 The country\u2019s banking system is taken over by the government, after its three largest banks run out of money. Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing have amassed assets 10 times greater than the size of Iceland\u2019s annual economic output, but can no longer fund themselves. The collapse of Landsbanki means that 400,000 British and Dutch savers who have put money into its Icesave accounts have lost their deposits. The UK and the Netherlands say they will be refunded in full using taxpayers\u2019 funds. Alistair Darling, then chancellor of the exchequer, uses anti-terrorism powers to freeze Landsbanki\u2019s UK assets. November 2008 Iceland imposes capital controls to protect the krona and stop foreign currency flooding out of the country. The government receives a $2.1bn (\u00a31.4bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund, the first western European state to get an IMF bailout since 1976. February 2009 Prime minister J\u00f3hanna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir\u2019s centre-left coalition is elected on a promise to apply for EU membership. March 2010 Icelandic voters overwhelmingly reject a referendum proposal to pay the UK and the Netherlands \u20ac4bn in compensation for the collapse of Icesave. The Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano begins erupting, creating a giant ash cloud that hovers over the Europe and grounds flights for more than a week. December 2010 Iceland\u2019s government agrees a plan to repay the UK and the Netherlands \u20ac4bn lost in the Icesave collapse. The final repayment will be made by 2046. April 2011 Iceland\u2019s voters reject the Icesave repayment plan in a second referendum. On this occasion, 58% voted no, compared with 93% who voted against an even tougher plan in the first referendum. February 2012 Fitch credit-rating agency raises Iceland\u2019s rating to BBB-, meaning the country is fit for investment. January 2013 Iceland wins a sweeping victory at the court of the European Free Trade Association, upholding the government\u2019s decision not to compensate the UK and the Netherlands for the lost Landsbanki deposits. April 2013 A centre-right Eurosceptic coalition comes to power. The Social Democrats are punished at the ballot box, after four years of austerity tailored to international lenders\u2019 requirements. March 2015 The government announces it is no longer seeking EU membership. June 2015 Iceland\u2019s parliament approves measures to ease the end of capital controls.",

    "webTitle": "Revealed: the video the Candy brothers' tax adviser didn't want you to see", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A promotional video featuring the property tycoons behind London\u2019s most expensive housing complex, One Hyde Park, was edited after an adviser warned it could raise \u201chuge issues\u201d with the tax department. Brothers Nicholas and Christian Candy, who are Conservative party donors, made millions of pounds from building the super-luxe apartments overlooking the royal park, with iris-scanning security, a virtual golf range in the basement, views of Harrods \u2013 and price tags of up to \u00a3140m. When the complex was nearly finished, the Candys were interviewed for a promotional video along with Richard Rogers, the architect who designed the glass and steel structures. The Guardian has been given an uncut early version which contains footage that was never meant to come to light. The video surfaced, along with a strongly worded memo to the film-maker, in which an adviser to the Candys suggested a series of changes that would \u201chugely improve the tax profile\u201d. One Hyde Park, which has generated about \u00a32bn in sales, has been described as an \u201coffshore island\u201d in the middle of London. Many apartments were snapped up by overseas buyers looking for tax breaks, and the building itself was owned and developed by a company based in the tax haven of Guernsey. The leaked material illustrates how careful the creators of finely balanced offshore structures have to be in their use of language. The Candy brothers reject any suggestion the structure they used was \u201cartificial\u201d, but a tax barrister said the video might raise questions for HM Revenue and Customs. \u201cGenerally: it needs quite a lot of editing in order for it to be \u2018compliant\u2019,\u201d the memo warned. \u201cOne theme running through the film is Chris often talking as if he was the developer: this is not really appropriate and I wander [sic] if Richard from PGGL [another director and Candy company executive] should make some of the statements. This would hugely improve the tax profile.\u201d PGGL is Project Grande (Guernsey) Limited, the company which owned and developed One Hyde Park, and the only Candy brother to hold a stake in PGGL was Christian, who is a tax exile in Monaco. The other stakeholder was the former prime minister of Qatar. The offshore structure was set up when the Candys decided to divide their business in two. Interior decoration and project management remained in the UK, overseen by the elder brother, Nick, who is married to the pop singer Holly Valance. The most profitable and most risky element \u2013 developing and selling property \u2013 moved offshore. It is run by the younger brother, Christian, through his Guernsey-based CPC Group, which was founded in 2004, the year the land for the One Hyde Park development was acquired. Companies doing business in the UK but established offshore must not be run from the UK. Some moments in the film could be seen as suggesting the brothers were jointly appointing the architects, bidding for the land and negotiating with the builders \u2013 all jobs normally done by property developers. Lord Rogers also appears to refer to Nick and Christian as the developers. He says on the film: \u201cThe Candys are exceptionally good developers ... I met the Candy brothers at a meeting at Land Securities [the firm which sold Bowater House, the office block that was demolished to build One Hyde Park] ... not long afterwards they approached us with this project.\u201d The memo suggests the Candys\u2019 adviser was concerned that Nick should not, for tax reasons, be seen to act in any way as the developer, and that Christian should not be presented as the only developer because the owner of the scheme was PGGL. It is initialled SMS, and the author is thought to be Steven Miles Smith, a qualified tax accountant and head of corporate finance at CPC. He suggested cutting statements made by Christian Candy (CC), Rogers (RR) and Ray O\u2019Rourke (ROR), the head of the building contractor, Laing O\u2019Rourke. Excerpts from the memo include: \u2022 \u201cRR says the Candy\u2019s are property developers.\u201d \u2022 \u201cRR says \u2018Candy Bros needed a return on their money\u2019 \u2013 very bad!\u201d \u2022 \u201cROR talks about a breakfast meeting with Chris where the contract was agreed. This gives HUGE issues. He then goes on to describe the meeting itself. BAD.\u201d \u2022 \u201cROR refers to they, meaning N&amp;C, when he should have said PGGL\u201d \u2022 \u201cCC refers to \u2018selecting our contractors\u2019: PGGL selects the contractors.\u201d \u2022 \u201cROR talks about the brothers\u2019 exacting requirements: could be OK in an interior design/development management context: but he talks as if he takes instructions from N&amp;C.\u201d The hour and a half of interviews, recorded in 2010, are just a snapshot of a five-year project, but they show how hard it was in practice for the brothers to maintain the separation of their businesses. The film raised another issue, according to the memo. As a tax exile, Christian can only spend a few months a year in the UK. But on camera he boasts: \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here now every single week for five years \u2026 my heart still races, I still get so excited just by \u2026 seeing it.\u201d The memo\u2019s verdict on that comment is stated in capitals: \u201cVERY UNHELPFUL!\u201d After being contacted by the Guardian, lawyers for the Candys said: \u201cThe claim that Christian Candy visited One Hyde Park every single week for five years is absolutely denied, and is totally and demonstrably untrue.\u201d The Guardian did not reveal that it had a copy of the video. The remarks on film may well have been careless, unguarded or exaggerated. People have often used the term \u201cthe Candy brothers\u201d as shorthand, but their lawyers argue this was \u201cmisrepresenting\u201d the actual situation. They said the division of the brothers\u2019 business into UK and Guernsey entities was \u201creal\u201d, \u201clegitimate\u201d, and designed to \u201cminimise risk\u201d when making investments. The tax barrister and campaigner David Quentin said the video might raise questions for HMRC. \u201cIf the formal structure they set up doesn\u2019t reflect what is actually happening commercially then they could be underpaying their tax,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite often huge amounts of additional tax are potentially payable and the question is whether the information, resources or political will exist for HMRC to mount a challenge.\u201d Speaking generally, Fiona Fernie, tax partner at Pinsent Masons, said: \u201cHMRC will expect to see that the decisions for a business are genuinely being taken offshore. If management and control of a business is in the UK it\u2019s potentially open to UK corporation tax.\u201d Comments in the video by Graham Stirk, a partner in the Rogers practice, could also give the impression that Nick Candy was acting as a developer, rather than an interior designer. He said: \u201cIt was the bid for this site actually, that was when we first met them. It was in Victoria. It was in this little really small office, and they were wishing to make a bid for the site and asked if we would prepare a feasibility study.\u201d Towards the end of the video, Christian says: \u201cThis project can\u2019t be built by just Nick and myself. We\u2019ve got a phenomenal team beneath us ....\u201d Karen Buck, the MP for Westminster North, whose constituency includes One Hyde Park, said: \u201cAt the very least, this video and the comments in the associated memo illustrate how guarded those involved feel they have to be to stay within those rules. \u201cThere may be explanations for all the edits they recommend, but HMRC need to satisfy themselves that these are robust, and all the tax affairs relating to the development of this landmark luxury housing scheme have been properly discharged.\u201d The Candys\u2019 lawyers said: \u201cAny suggestion that the corporate structure behind One Hyde Park is artificial is simply not correct. PGGL as the developer of One Hyde Park purchased Bowater House, appointed the architects of One Hyde Park, appointed Laing O\u2019Rourke as building contractor and appointed Candy &amp; Candy Ltd in its capacity as development manager and interior designer only.\u201d",

As a tax exile, Christian can only spend a few months a year in the UK. But on camera he boasts: \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here now every single week for five years \u2026 my heart still races, I still get so excited just by \u2026 seeing it.\u201d<br></p> <p>The memo\u2019s verdict on that comment is stated in capitals: \u201cVERY UNHELPFUL!\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40259ad19a32c0825917e8ca4fbd8468de31d6c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40259ad19a32c0825917e8ca4fbd8468de31d6c3/0_0_1824_371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Memo from adviser to the Candy brothers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Memo from adviser to the Candy brothers.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After being contacted by the Guardian, lawyers for the Candys said: \u201cThe claim that Christian Candy visited One Hyde Park every single week for five years is absolutely denied, and is totally and demonstrably untrue.\u201d The Guardian did not reveal that it had a copy of the video.<br></p> <p>The remarks on film may well have been careless, unguarded or exaggerated. People have often used the term \u201cthe Candy brothers\u201d as shorthand, but their lawyers argue this was \u201cmisrepresenting\u201d the actual situation. They said the division of the brothers\u2019 business into UK and Guernsey entities was \u201creal\u201d, \u201clegitimate\u201d, and designed to \u201cminimise risk\u201d when making investments. <br></p> <p>The tax barrister and campaigner David Quentin said the video might raise questions for HMRC. \u201cIf the formal structure they set up doesn\u2019t reflect what is actually happening commercially then they could be underpaying their tax,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite often huge amounts of additional tax are potentially payable and the question is whether the information, resources or political will exist for HMRC to mount a challenge.\u201d<br></p> <p>Speaking generally, Fiona Fernie, tax partner at Pinsent Masons, said: \u201cHMRC will expect to see that the decisions for a business are genuinely being taken offshore. If management and control of a business is in the UK it\u2019s potentially open to UK corporation tax.\u201d<br></p> <p>Comments in the video by Graham Stirk, a partner in the Rogers practice, could also give the impression that Nick Candy was acting as a developer, rather than an interior designer. He said: \u201cIt was the bid for this site actually, that was when we first met them. It was in Victoria. It was in this little really small office, and they were wishing to make a bid for the site and asked if we would prepare a feasibility study.\u201d<br></p> <p>Towards the end of the video, Christian says: \u201cThis project can\u2019t be built by just Nick and myself. We\u2019ve got a phenomenal team beneath us ....\u201d<br></p> <p>Karen Buck, the MP for Westminster North, whose constituency includes One Hyde Park, said: \u201cAt the very least, this video and the comments in the associated memo illustrate how guarded those involved feel they have to be to stay within those rules. </p> <p>\u201cThere may be explanations for all the edits they recommend, but HMRC need to satisfy themselves that these are robust, and all the tax affairs relating to the development of this landmark luxury housing scheme have been properly discharged.\u201d</p> <p>The Candys\u2019 lawyers said: \u201cAny suggestion that the corporate structure behind One Hyde Park is artificial is simply not correct. PGGL as the developer of One Hyde Park purchased Bowater House, appointed the architects of One Hyde Park, appointed Laing O\u2019Rourke as building contractor and appointed Candy &amp; Candy Ltd in its capacity as development manager and interior designer only.\u201d<br></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A vote to leave the EU could cut the UK\u2019s credit rating, according to the ratings agency Moody\u2019s, which has waded into the debate with a warning about rushing the referendum. The agency, which rates UK government debt one notch below the top triple-A score, says holding a referendum on EU membership next year would cut the period of uncertainty but at the same time would allow less time to negotiate reforms with Brussels. That in turn would raise the chance of a vote to leave the EU, a so-called Brexit, with possible consequences for the UK\u2019s rating. In Moody\u2019s view, a shorter time frame increases the risk that the UK government will not manage to secure the changes that it is seeking, which in turn may negatively influence the government\u2019s willingness to support remaining in the EU,\u201d the agency says in an update on the UK. While the outcome of the referendum remains uncertain, Moody\u2019s believes that a withdrawal from the EU would have negative implications for the UK\u2019s growth prospects and \u2013 in the absence of an alternative trade arrangement with the EU that at least partly replicates the current access to the EU\u2019s single market \u2013 would likely put pressure on the UK\u2019s sovereign rating. David Cameron had vowed to hold an in/out referendum by 2017 but there has been talk of moving the vote forward to 2016, to avoid a politically dangerous clash with the French and German elections in 2017. Moody\u2019s says that would cut the time available for the UK government to lobby for repatriation of powers. Moody\u2019s also warns, in its update, that George Osborne\u2019s planned cuts appear overly ambitious and he is likely to miss his target to balance the public finances by the end of this parliament. The agency forecasts economic growth will remain \u201csolid\u201d this year and next but says that its \u201chigh debt burden remains a key weakness\u201d. While welcoming government pledges on raising productivity and cutting the deficit it is sceptical about how much can be achieved in the short-term. Moody\u2019s believes that the government will indeed manage to reduce the budget deficit substantially over the coming years, given its commitment as well as robust GDP growth and a continuing low interest-rate and inflation environment,\u201d says the report, by senior credit officer Kathrin Muehlbronner. At the same time, the rating agency believes that achieving the spending cuts targeted by the government might be difficult to achieve in full, and the agency therefore expects a more moderate reduction in the budget deficit, to just above 1% of GDP by the end of this parliament. The agency\u2019s support for austerity measures puts it at odds with those who have warned more severe cuts in the near-term could dent the UK\u2019s economic recovery. The Paris-based OECD thinktank used its latest outlook for big economies last week to warn that Osborne should spread the pain of tough public spending cuts beyond the next two years. Osborne\u2019s most recent budget pointed to two years of sharp cuts, followed by a freeze in 2018-19 and a rise in 2019-20. But the OECD said delaying some of the cuts planned for the financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17 would lower the impact on growth. A separate report by International Monetary Fund economists added fuel to the austerity debate by raising the idea that some countries that had racked up debts in the aftermath of the banking crash, but presided over sound economies, should just live with their debts, rather than run surplus budgets to bring them down. But the business group CBI used its latest economic outlook for the UK to call on the government to keep up its austerity drive, given businesses still ranked deficit reduction as a top priority. At the same time it cut its growth forecasts for the UK after official figures showed a slow start to this year. Moody\u2019s forecasts for UK growth this year were more optimistic. It says GDP will grow by 2.7% and 2.4% in 2015 and 2016 respectively. That compares with the CBI\u2019s forecasts for 2.4% this year and 2.5% in 2016. The OECD also says growth will be 2.4% this year but will then slow to 2.3% next year. Moody\u2019s echoed other forecasters in warning the UK economy remains overreliant on demand from consumers despite a government push to boost manufacturing and exports. Muehlbronner said: The UK\u2019s economic growth pattern remains relatively unbalanced and mainly driven by domestic demand and the services sector, while exports and manufacturing remain subdued. She also highlighted a \u201ccontinuing high level of household debt, which makes households and the banking sector vulnerable to a house price shock or rapid increases in interest rates\u201d, adding: Longer-term growth challenges for the UK economy might arise if the weak productivity performance of the past several years persists.",

On Thursday, Australia recorded its largest ever trade deficit and there was no increase in April\u2019s retail trade figures. </p> <p>Given our economic growth was driven largely by exports and households\u2019 consumption, the collapse of exports in April and stagnant retail sales suggested a big hit to economic growth.</p> <p>Fortunately, the figures are not as bad as they seem on the surface.</p> <p>In April, the value of Australian imports exceeded our exports by $3.888bn. That broke the record for the largest monthly trade deficit \u2013 beating the $3.881bn deficit of February 2008.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/7n0eW/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It was not a good result. The <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-04/trade-deficit-more-than-trebles/6521468\">ABC</a> reported one economist calling it a \u201cdisaster\u201d. And for an economy which depends upon exports for a sizeable amount of growth, it is certainly not something that would fill anyone with great joy.</p> <p>But we do need to be careful not to get too filled with economic sadness.</p> <p>Yes the trade deficit was the largest in seasonally adjusted terms but, as you can see from the graph, that measure jumps around a hell of a lot. In trend terms it\u2019s not even in the worst 20 months.</p> <p>Also, the trade deficit is a record in current dollars. Since February 2008 our economy has grown about 35% in current dollars. So back then, the trade deficit was equivalent to about 3.9% of one month of GDP; the deficit in April was closer to just 2.9% of GDP. Still big, but certainly not record breaking.</p> <p>There were two reasons why the deficit was so large in April; one of them is not so good, the other is not so bad.</p> <p>Essentially our exports drastically decreased and our imports drastically increased:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/KXuD2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The big fall in exports came mostly due to a 13% drop in iron ore (and other minerals) and a whopping 22% fall in coal exports:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/6AAeI/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The fall in coal exports can be explained mostly by the closure of coal ports and freight lines due to flooding in <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-22/storm-lashes-central-coast-fishing-cattle-coal/6412038\">New South Wales</a>. So that impact is a one-off.

      "bodyText": "Last week, a day after the latest GDP figures, it seemed the dark economic clouds had arrived on the horizon. On Thursday, Australia recorded its largest ever trade deficit and there was no increase in April\u2019s retail trade figures. Given our economic growth was driven largely by exports and households\u2019 consumption, the collapse of exports in April and stagnant retail sales suggested a big hit to economic growth. Fortunately, the figures are not as bad as they seem on the surface. In April, the value of Australian imports exceeded our exports by $3.888bn. That broke the record for the largest monthly trade deficit \u2013 beating the $3.881bn deficit of February 2008. It was not a good result. The ABC reported one economist calling it a \u201cdisaster\u201d. And for an economy which depends upon exports for a sizeable amount of growth, it is certainly not something that would fill anyone with great joy. But we do need to be careful not to get too filled with economic sadness. Yes the trade deficit was the largest in seasonally adjusted terms but, as you can see from the graph, that measure jumps around a hell of a lot. In trend terms it\u2019s not even in the worst 20 months. Also, the trade deficit is a record in current dollars. Since February 2008 our economy has grown about 35% in current dollars. So back then, the trade deficit was equivalent to about 3.9% of one month of GDP; the deficit in April was closer to just 2.9% of GDP. Still big, but certainly not record breaking. There were two reasons why the deficit was so large in April; one of them is not so good, the other is not so bad. Essentially our exports drastically decreased and our imports drastically increased: The big fall in exports came mostly due to a 13% drop in iron ore (and other minerals) and a whopping 22% fall in coal exports: The fall in coal exports can be explained mostly by the closure of coal ports and freight lines due to flooding in New South Wales. So that impact is a one-off. The drop in the iron ore exports is a victim of the drop in iron ore prices. The Australian Bureau of Statistics noted that \u201ciron ore lump\u201d exports were down $214m due to a 7% drop in quantity and a 14% fall in prices. Iron ore \u201cfines\u201d were down $344m due to a fall in quantity of just 2%, but a fall in price of 10%. When prices are falling you need to increase quantity to keep the total value steady. In April both the quantity and the price fell. That is more of a concern than with the drop in coal exports but, on the bright side, there has been a good improvement in the value of iron ore prices up to about US$66 a tonne: It\u2019s still low compared with the US$135-a-tonne prices that were being paid in 2013, but it is a lot better than the US$40 that some were expecting a couple of months ago. So while exports did fall in April the news is not all that dire. The second reason for the record trade deficit was a big jump in imports. But this is not really bad news, because the jump was mostly due to a massive increase in the import of machinery and equipment from Korea to Western Australia: The rumour is the that it was a number of locomotives for Gina Rinehart\u2019s Roy Hill mine. Regardless, a rise in imports is not necessarily a bad thing, and in this case for goods that will be used on projects within Australia providing income and employment in the medium to long term, it is decidedly a good thing. The figures do however show the decline in exports to China has been going for nearly 18 months: The value of exports to China was the lowest it has been since October 2012. In the March quarter household consumption contributed 0.3 percentage points to the 0.9% growth in GDP. It was second only to exports. Thus the release last week of the latest retail trade figures which showed no change in spending from March to April was certainly a disappointment. Retail spending does not account for all household consumption \u2013 for example it doesn\u2019t include spending on rents, insurance, health, electricity and gas, but it still accounts for about 30% of all household consumption. The lack of growth in April saw annual growth falter slightly, dropping from 4.4% to 4.1%: But there is reason to think this is not all bad news. These figures for April take into account the usual gloomy talk of what was to come in the budget and, more importantly, they don\u2019t reflect the measures in the budget which will assist retail spending \u2013 namely the $20,000 instant asset write-off. In April the big fall in spending was in \u201cother retailing\u201d sector which includes such things as \u201centertainment and media\u201d, however there was also flat growth in the \u201chousehold goods retailing sector\u201d: This latter sector includes items such as computers and computer peripheries, hardware and building supplies, and electrical and electronic goods. These are products which would expect to see a boost in sales due to the small business asset write-off. Early reports \u2013 which can be pretty ropey given it is in business interests to talk up sales \u2013 are that there has been an increase in these sales since the budget. The international and retail trade data which came out last week \u2013 while certainly not positive and something that would need to improve for the June quarter GDP figures to continue the solid growth exhibited in March \u2013 should not be a cause for alarm. There certainly remain risks ahead for the economy from investment and concerns of a bubble in the housing market. But just as we should not pop the champagne corks on the basis of one quarter of GDP growth, neither should we descend into gloom on the basis of one poor month of trade data.",
