      "bodyText": "The west\u2019s leading economic thinktank has warned Donald Trump that a trade war prompted by US protectionism threatens to derail a recovery in global growth, which has reached its highest level in seven years. In its latest interim forecasts, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it expected the world economy to expand by 3.9% in both 2018 and 2019 \u2013 a 0.3 percentage point upgrade in each year from its last set of predictions last November. The OECD said investment, trade and employment were all playing a part in a broad-based expansion that has prompted growth upgrades for six of the seven G7 countries. US tax cuts, announced by Trump since the OECD\u2019s November forecasts, were one reason why the growth outlook was stronger than it was four months ago, the thinktank said. \u201cGrowth is steady or improving in most G20 countries and the expansion is continuing,\u201d said OECD acting chief economist Alvaro Pereira. Pereira added that Trump\u2019s recently announced tariffs \u2013 25% on imported steel and 10% on imported aluminium \u2013 had left the global economy vulnerable to a tit-for-tat trade war. \u201cThis could obviously threaten the recovery. Certainly we believe this is a significant risk, so we hope that it doesn\u2019t materialise because it would be fairly damaging,\u201d Pereira said. Pereira said the imposition of tariffs by the White House was the wrong way of dealing with the global problem of excess steel production and called for Trump to seek a collective solution through the OECD. \u201cSafeguarding the rules-based international trading system is key,\u201d he added. The boost to demand provided by Trump\u2019s tax cuts has meant that the OECD has revised up its forecast for US growth by 0.4 points to 2.9% in 2018 and by 0.7 points to 2.8% in 2019. However, it believes faster growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy will result in four increases in interest rates from the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, this year. The OECD also revised up its forecasts for Germany and France, but remained gloomy about the prospects for Britain as it approaches the date for Brexit in March 2019. Tax cuts included in the deal that has pieced together a coalition government in Germany were seen as lifting growth in the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy to 2.4% this year, up 0.1 points on November, and to 2.2% in 2019 (up by 0.3 points). Emmanuel Macron\u2019s social welfare, tax and labour market reforms would help France narrow the gap with Germany, the thinktank said, with growth forecast at an 11-year high of 2.2% before easing to 1.9% in 2019. French growth has been revised up by 0.4 points in 2018 and by 0.2 points in 2019. For the eurozone as a whole, growth is put at 2.3% this year and 2.1% in 2019, a 0.2 point upgrade in each year. The thinktank believes the UK economy will expand by 1.3% this year, up from 1.2% in November, and by an unchanged 1.1% in 2019.",

    "webTitle": "Spring statement: Hammond sees better times ahead despite weak growth, as \u00a337bn Brexit bill looms - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has promised Britain that \u201cour best days lie ahead of us\u201d, as he delivered an upbeat spring statement paving the way for a boost to public spending in the autumn. The chancellor announced that GDP is expected to rise faster than previously thought, at 1.5%, up from 1.4% in November\u2019s budget. But growth is still expected to slow to just 1.3% in 2019 and 2020, and be a little slower in 2021 and 2022. City economists said the growth outlook was woeful. The OBR has estimated that divorcing from the EU will cost Britain more than \u00a337bn. The bill, which includes the Brussels pensions bill, won\u2019t be paid off until the 2060s. The watchdog also outlined how UK has committed to replacing various EU funding after Brexit, suggesting there won\u2019t be much cash left over (at least in the next few years) The OBR also warned that Britain\u2019s long-term outlook was little changed since the last budget. It fears that the recent pick-up in productivity will fade too. Everyday single-use plastic items such as disposable coffee cups, takeaway boxes and polystyrene packaging could be hit with charges akin to the 5p levy on plastic bags, the government has warned. The Treasury has floated the prospect of abolishing 1p and 2p coins, and possibly \u00a350 notes too. The idea was raised in a consultation document on the future of cash and digital payments, one of 13 consultation papers published by the Treasury alongside the spring statement. (See 3.21pm.) Labour has accused Hammond of \u201castounding\u201d complacency. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, made the claim as he responded to the spring statement. Labour pointed out that last year growth was the slowest in the G7, that growth forecasts for the next few years are all lower than in March 2017 and that even the OBR is saying that earnings growth over the next five years will be \u201csubdued\u201d. That\u2019s all from us today. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the spring statement, and our round-up of the key points: Thanks for reading, and for the comments. AS and GW The chancellor did his best to make his speech sparkle, with a few rib-ticklers.... Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says Philip Hammond has a lot more work to do: Since he became chancellor in the summer of 2016, Hammond has sought to improve the UK\u2019s productivity record through a range of measures including higher infrastructure spending, extra investment in research and development and a greater emphasis on vocational training. But judging by its forecasts, the OBR thinks it will take many years for things to get better. It believes that the financial crisis and the deep recession that followed dealt a severe and lasting blow to Britain\u2019s long-term growth rate, reducing it from around 2.25% a year to 1.5% a year The OBR have also adjusted their house price growth forecasts, and now expected weaker growth from 2019 onwards. The main organisation representing NHS trusts in England has welcomed Philip Hammond\u2019s \u201cencouraging\u201d recognition that the health service needs more money, though wants \u201curgent\u201d action on that front, in contrast to the chancellor\u2019s decision to hold back any details -- and any extra cash -- until the autumn. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: It is encouraging that the chancellor has acknowledged funding pressures faced by the NHS which mean the service can\u2019t deliver the levels of patient care set out in the NHS constitution [key waiting time standards such as A&amp;E treatment within four hours and planned hospital care within 18 weeks]. This winter we have seen the impact of under-funding and a lack of staff. We need to see urgent steps put in train to ensure sustainable long term funding for health and social care, because the current situation is unsustainable. It is also vital that any deal that is reached on pay is fully funded, as promised in the budget. The latest OBR forecasts for earnings are hardly Tiggerish. The fiscal watchdog estimates that real earnings growth (pay minus inflation) will be subdued over the next five years, growing by just 0.7% per year. Even more depressingly, growth in real household disposable income per person is expected to average only 0.4%. That means families won\u2019t feel much better off for a long time.... The Scottish government is complaining that it is not getting its fair share of the money set aside for Brexit preparations. In a statement Derek Mackay, the Scottish finance minister, said: We are just over 12 months away from formally exiting the EU without a clearly agreed path in terms of our on-going access to key EU markets - this remains the biggest uncertainty hampering economic growth and investment and dragging our economy down. The UK government have indicated they will allocate \u00a33bn over 2018-19 and 2019-20 for expenditure on Brexit preparations, but that the Scottish Government will only receive 2.5%, or \u00a337m, of the funding allocated in 2018-19. No details on 2019-20 funding have been provided. It is deeply frustrating that money we are receiving is significantly short of a full Barnett share of the funding allocated at the UK level. Scottish Ministers will now carefully consider how these resources should be allocated to meet priority areas of expenditure and whether they are sufficient for the challenge ahead. We will not allow spending on Scottish public services to be diverted to meet the cost of a damaging UK Brexit. The government is theoretically committed to get net migration below 100,000 per year \u201cTheoretically\u201d, because many ministers believe the target is unachievable. And the OBR does not believe it will be hit either. This is what it says in a passage about its Brexit assumptions. Specifically, as regards the economy forecast, we assume that: The UK adopts a tighter migration regime following departure from the EU than that currently in place, but not sufficiently restrictive to reduce net inward migration to the desired \u2018tens of thousands\u2019. Three years ago this week, George Osborne proudly announced a new Help To Buy ISA that would (he claimed) get first-time buyers scrambling onto the housing ladder. Under the plan, the government would provide a \u00a350 top-up for every \u00a3200 saved for a deposit on a home (up to a \u00a312,000 deposit). A classic pre-election vote-winner, you might think. However, it was later dubbed a \u2018scandal\u2019 after it emerged that the government wouldn\u2019t actually chip in until the home had been bought. And now, the OBR has slashed its forecasts for the cost of the scheme, as take-up has been much weaker than it expected. The watchdog says: The original costing estimated that cumulative Government expenditure would reach nearly \u00a3700m by the end of 2017-18. But take-up so far has been well below expectations and the total value of payments in the first 22 months of the scheme \u2013 to September 2017 \u2013 was just \u00a3104m. We have revised down our forecast by a cumulative 23 per cent relative to our previous forecast. Compared to the original costing, cumulative spending is around 80 per cent (some \u00a31.7bn) lower up to the end of 2019-20 This is from Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway. It has attracted this comment from Rupert Harrison, chief of staff to George Osborne when he was chancellor. This is from the Press Association\u2019s Ian Jones. Here are some comments from opposition MPs on the spring statement. MPs were responding in the House of Commons. From John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor: I say to the chancellor: his complacency today is astounding. We face \u2013 in every public service \u2013 a crisis on a scale we\u2019ve never seen before. Hasn\u2019t he listened to the doctors and nurses, the teachers, the police officers, the carers and even his own councillors? They are telling him they can\u2019t wait for the next budget. They\u2019re telling him to act now. For eight years they\u2019ve been ignored by this government. And today - they\u2019ve been ignored again. The chancellor has proclaimed that there is light at the end of the tunnel. But this shows just how cut off from the real world he is. Last year growth in our economy was among the lowest in the G7 and the slowest since 2012. Wages are lower now - in real terms - than they were in 2010 \u2013 and they\u2019re still falling. We face \u2013 in every public service \u2013 a crisis on a scale we\u2019ve never seen before. Hasn\u2019t he listened to the doctors and nurses, the teachers, the police officers, the carers and even his own councillors? They are telling him they can\u2019t wait for the next budget. They\u2019re telling him to act now. From Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster: The progress of this government in readying for Brexit has been nothing short of shameful. The UK government\u2019s own analysis tells us that under all scenarios, Scotland would suffer a relatively greater loss in economic output than the United Kingdom as a whole. A no deal scenario would be significantly devastating, threatening to reduce growth by a massive 9% over 15 years. Make no mistake that a hard Brexit is going to hit the pockets of families, is going to lead to a loss in tax revenue expectations. It\u2019s therefore going to affect spending on public services, and yet the chancellor is silent on the risks to our economy. From the Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable: The spring statement was a non-event. The OECD [see 11.33am] gave us the clearer picture - that the economy is bumping along the bottom of the G20, well behind the likes of Australia, Canada and the euro area. The OBR\u2019s fresh forecasts are still a long way behind the figures estimated in March 2016 before the EU referendum. It is time the government was honest with the public: there will need to be tax increases to pay for the NHS and social care, police and schools. From the Green MP Caroline Lucas: I have to say that the levels of hypocrisy from this government is quite extraordinary. How can he pledge to be improving air quality while simultaneously boasting of undertaking the largest road building programme since the 1970s. How can he say that the plastics crisis is urgent and then propose a deadline for the elimination of plastics in a quarter of a century\u2019s time. Where is the latte levy, where is the deposit scheme, where is the urgency from this action. Why is there such a gulf between government action and the words. Nick Macpherson, former Permanent Secretary to the Treasury (the top civil servant), suggests Philip Hammond is right to keep his fiscal firepower in case the UK suffers an economic shock.... Last year my collaegue Anushka Asthana revealed that, when George Osborne was chancellor, he came close to abolishing 1p and 2p coins. The idea was blocked by David Cameron, who thought the public would disapprove. Now Philip Hammond has revived the idea. One of the 13 consultations he has published is on cash and digital payments, and the document (pdf) makes it clear that the Treasury increasingly thinks these coins are pointless. In a section of the consultation document leading up to the question \u201cdoes the current denominational mix (eight coins and four banknotes) meet your current and future needs?\u201d, the document says: In the normal course of the cash cycle, many denominations fall out of circulation, for example, by being placed into savings jars. Surveys suggest that six in ten 1p and 2p coins are used in a transaction once before they leave the cash cycle. They are either saved, or in 8% of cases are thrown away. To meet demand created by such losses from circulation, in previous years the government and the Royal Mint have needed to produce and issue over 500 million 1p and 2p coins each year to replace those falling out of circulation. The document also suggests that \u00a350 notes could be abolished too. At the other end of the denominational scale the \u00a350 note is believed to be rarely used for routine purchases and is instead held as a store of value. There is a significant overseas demand for \u00a350 notes, with the notes used for some transactions, but mainly held as a store of value alongside other currencies such as the dollar and euro. There is also a perception among some that \u00a350 notes are used for money laundering, hidden economy activity, and tax evasion ... Though the value of the \u00a350 note is low compared to other countries\u2019 highest denominations, in order to attempt to tackle the hidden economy and illegitimate use of cash, and maintain the integrity of the currency, some countries have removed their highest value notes from circulation or replaced them with banknotes with more security features. Although the OBR are forecasting slow growth over the next five years, they certainly aren\u2019t ruling out something worse. The watchdog points out that there have been seven recessions over the last 61 years, suggesting that there\u2019s a 50:50 risk of one in the next five years. Thus, ...the probability of a cyclical shock occurring sometime over our forecast horizon is fairly high. The OBR also reminds us that neither the Treasury or the City actually forecast the great recession after the 2008 financial crisis: As regards this final risk of an unexpected recession, it is salutary to remember that exactly 10 years ago \u2013 at the spring Budget of March 2008 \u2013 the Treasury forecast that the economy would grow by a cumulative 4 per cent in calendar years 2008 and 2009, whereas the latest outturn data show a drop of 4.6 per cent. As Chart 3.30 shows, only one of the 34 outside forecasters reporting their forecasts to the Treasury at the time predicted that real GDP would decline in either 2008 or 2009. In the Treasury\u2019s latest survey, none of the 40 respondents expect real GDP to decline in either 2018 or 2019. Although the growth forecast for 2018 has been marginally revised upwards, the IFS\u2019s Paul Johnson says, overall, the picture is still dreadful. This chart illustrates one of his points. UPDATE: Paul Johnson\u2019s tweet has been retweeted by George Osborne. Osborne likes Philip Hammond, and so he probably retweeted it because he thought it reflected badly on Brexit, not on his successor. The OBR says the amount of money the government is expected to raise from the soft drinks levy - a tax on sugar in drinks coming into force this year - has halved. It says in its report: We have once again revised down receipts from the soft drinks industry levy, which comes into effect in April. The latest revision averages \u00a330 million a year and reflects the latest information on reformulation rates. We now expect the levy to raise around \u00a3240 million a year on average from 2018-19 onwards, less than half the government\u2019s target of \u00a3500 million in 2019-20 when it announced it in March 2016. The Treasury said this was a good thing because it showed that manufacturers have cut the amount of sugar in their drinks. A spokesman said: This levy is about changing behaviour. It\u2019s about making people healthier overall. It\u2019s really positive that the industry has recognised this and engaged so much on this. As the Press Association reports, from next month, the most sugary soft drinks - those with more than 8g of sugar per 100ml - are to be taxed at 24p per litre, while those with 5g of sugar per 100ml will pay 18p. City economists are giving their verdicts on today\u2019s forecasts, and some are pretty gloomy.... Aberdeen Standard Investments chief economist Lucy O\u2019Carroll says Britain faces \u2018a decade of austerity\u2019 at least. \u201cThe Chancellor was always clear that today\u2019s event was to be a modest one, and he kept that promise. But there is little to cheer by way of economic progress. A woeful growth outlook by past standards. Potentially massive dislocation for the economy just around the corner. And all subject to huge, Brexit-related uncertainties. \u201cMr Hammond was keen to push a message about there being light at the end of the tunnel. It\u2019s true that the country\u2019s debt burden is about to fall. It\u2019s also true that for the first time since the financial crisis the UK is borrowing only to invest, rather than to fund day-to-day spending. \u201cBut the Chancellor has made it clear that we\u2019ll remain in the tunnel for a while yet: there will be no fundamental reassessment of the UK\u2019s spending needs until 2020. That will mean, in effect, a decade of austerity \u2013 unprecedented in the post-war period. Hetal Mehta, senior european economist at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, agrees that Hammond probably won\u2019t relax the purse strings later this year \u201cAfter significant downgrades to growth and upward revisions to borrowing requirements just in November, the Office for Budget Responsibility has now revised up growth (for the near term) and taken down the borrowing forecasts over the next 5 years. \u201cThat said we don\u2019t expect Hammond to go on a spending splurge in the Autumn Budget. He will likely save the extra room for manoeuvre ahead of the next election and to cushion any downside risks emerging from the UK\u2019s departure from the EU.\u201d Jonathan Riley, head of tax at Grant Thornton UK, says Hammond\u2019s attempts to rebrand himself as a bouncy Tigger have a flaw.... \u201cToday was upbeat, but by the autumn we will know whether we have a Brexit deal or whether the UK will be moving straight to World Trade Organisation rules. So while Philip Hammond was the only one at the government despatch box today, the donkey in the room, the Eeyore, is still Brexit.\u201d Sky News\u2019s Faisal Islam and the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton are both unimpressed by today\u2019s growth forecasts (with good reason!) As the Resolution Foundation\u2019s Adam Corlett points out with this graph, the OBR now thinks that the output gap is positive. That means there is no spare capacity - in fact, the opposite And here is the Resolution Foundation\u2019s Torsten Bell commenting on what this means. In its analysis of the EU financial settlement (pdf) the OBR points out that, even though the government will stop making full contributions to the EU after Brexit, the government has committed to spend money on items that used to get funding through EU membership. In paragraph B.45 it puts figures on these commitments. Farm support - around \u00a33bn a year Shared prosperity fund (a proposed fund to replace EU structural funds, which fund projects in deprived areas) - around \u00a31bn a year Overseas development assistance (putting money that went into the EU\u2019s aid budget into the UK\u2019s aid budget instead) - around \u00a31bn a year Science and education (contributions to allow the UK to continue participating in programmes like Erasmus, Creative Europe and Horizon 2020) - around 2bn a year Regulatory agencies (participating in various EU agencies) - around \u00a340m a year. This chart compares how much the UK has been contributing to the EU (the light blue bars), with the amount it will pay after Brexit as part of the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d (the dark blue bars) and the money it will spend on items that used to be funded by the EU (the yellow bars). The black diamonds also represent the \u201cno referendum counterfactual\u201d - what the UK would have spent if it had carried on in the EU. If the UK does go ahead with the \u201cassumed spending in lieu of EU transfers\u201d assumed by the OBR, there is no saving at all. This does imply that the Vote Leave \u201c\u00a3350m per week for the NHS\u201d may be a long time coming ... More detail of the OBR\u2019s Brexit bill estimate: Economics professor Jonathan Portes has dug into the OBR\u2019s \u2018Brexit bill\u2019 work: The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that Britain\u2019s financial settlement with the EU will cost \u00a337.1bn. This figure is based on the \u2018phase 1\u2019 agreement which the UK agreed with member states last December, and is contained in an appendix to the OBR\u2019s latest forecasts. Almost half this bill relates to Britain\u2019s commitments under the current EU budget (the multiannual financial framework or MFF) that ends in December 2020. Around half is due to meeting Britain\u2019s share of outstanding payments at the end of the current MFF (known as the \u201creste \u00e0 liquider\u201d or RAL). The remaining small fraction reflects pension liabilities less assets returned to the UK, the OBR says. Most of the bill falls in the next few years, but the final cost drags on until the 2060s ... This falls smack in the middle of the Treasury\u2019s own forecasts, which put the divorce bill at between \u00a335bn and \u00a339bn. The OBR also warns that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d to quantify the full effect of Brexit on the public finances today: One of the more direct and readily quantifiable ways that Brexit will affect the public finances is by reducing or stopping the UK\u2019s contributions to the EU budget. But, soon after the referendum, the chancellor guaranteed funding for certain EU projects after the UK leaves the EU (eg in agriculture, science and structural fund projects), subject to various conditions. And the prime minister has subsequently stated that the UK may continue to make contributions where it wishes to participate in some European programmes. The government has not yet fully articulated its intentions in this area and, even if it had, the precise post-Brexit outcome remains subject to negotiation. The Treasury has published its spring statement documents on its website. It has published 13 consultation documents - all available here. Here is the Treasury\u2019s own summary of what is in the autumn statement. Here is the Treasury paper on corporate tax and the digital economy (pdf). And here are are the preliminary findings of the Oliver Letwin review into planning and housing (pdf). The Treasury has not published a red book, but the Office for Budget Responsibility has published its latest economic and fiscal outlook report. It runs to 243 pages and it is here (pdf). The Office for Budget Responsibility has released its verdict on the UK economy. And it points out that Britain\u2019s economy isn\u2019t in a much better place than four months ago, when the last budget was released. The OBR says: The economy has slightly more momentum in the near term, thanks to the unexpected strength of the world economy, but there seems little reason to change our view of its medium-term growth potential. And while the budget deficit looks likely to come in almost \u00a35bn lower this year than we expected in November, the explanations for this imply smaller downward revisions for future years. As a result, the government\u2019s headroom against its fiscal targets is virtually unchanged. On Brexit, the fiscal watchdog says there\u2019s been less damage than feared: The vote to leave the European Union appears to have slowed the economy, but by less than we expected immediately after the referendum \u2013 thanks in part to the willingness of consumers to maintain spending by reducing their saving. But it is important not to put too much weight on early estimates of economic activity either side of the referendum, not least because the bottom-up measures of GDP growth in the national accounts differ as to whether growth slowed down, speeded up or remained stable between 2016 and 2017. And on productivity, the OBR warns that recent improvements may not last. The biggest surprise in the economic data released since November is that productivity growth \u2013 measured as output per hour \u2013 has been much stronger than expected. But that reflects a much weaker path for average hours worked, rather than stronger output or weaker employment growth. The fall in average hours over the second half of 2017 is the largest since mid-2011 and second largest since the financial crisis. But in 2011 the fall in hours and associated pick-up in productivity growth proved to be erratic and were soon reversed. We assume for now that the same will be true on this occasion. More from the IFS\u2019s Paul Johnson: McDonnell says today\u2019s statement could have been a turning point. But it is a missed opportunity. The Conservatives chose to cut budgets for the super-rich, he says. He says we were never all in this together. He says today we have had the \u201cindefensible spectacle\u201d of the chancellor congratulating himself on marginally improved forecasts, while refusing to help councils. McDonnell says asking NHS workers to give up a day\u2019s holiday (reportedly a government proposals as part of the pay negotiations) is mean-spirited. And he says the government is today trying to get MPs to vote to take away free school meals from 1 million pupils. (That\u2019s a reference to one of the votes coming up this afternoon on statutory instruments. The government contests McDonnell\u2019s interpretation. There is a briefing on the issue here.) John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is responding to Hammond. He says Hammond\u2019s complacency is \u201castounding\u201d. Public service workers like doctors and nurses need Hammond to act now. Hammond says there is light at the end of the tunnel. That shows how cut off he is, McDonnell says. He says this is a government that single-handedly destroyed the solar panel industry. Hammond talks about the fourth industrial revolution, but Britain has the lowest rate of industrial robot use in the OED. He says Tory MPs can shout all they want, but people out there know the crisis in our communities. Hammond makes great play of reducing debt. But he has put \u00a3700m on the national debt, he says. He says the Tories said the deficit would be eliminated by 2015. George Osborne has been tweeting about achieving three years late a deficit target Osborne actually abandoned. More details of the plastic waste consultation: Hammond is now winding up, saying he wants the UK to be a force for good, and a country everyone can be proud of. Hammond says he will publish a call for evidence on whether the tax relief for agricultural diesel contributes to air pollution. And he will consult on tax cuts for low-emission vans. And he will consult on what can be done to reduce the use of plastics. This is not intended to raise revenue; it is about changing behaviour. Revenue raised will be invested in remedies. And he is committing \u00a320m now to help universities deliver solutions. Hammond announces consultation on using tax increases to reduce plastic use, with \u00a320m set aside now to help universities develop solutions. Hammond says he will consult on a new VAT collection mechanism for online payments. And he will consult on how to encourage digital payments. Hammond turns to housing. There is an investment programme of \u00a344bn, he says. He says Oliver Letwin\u2019s review of the planning system and its impact on housing has reached its initial findings. He will publish Letwin\u2019s statement. The full report will be published at the time of the budget. Here\u2019s some reaction to the chancellor\u2019s comments on NHS funding: More from the IFS\u2019s Paul Johnson: He was commenting on this: Hammond lists some infrastructure projects the government is funding. He says he is today inviting cities to bid for money from a new transport fund announced in the budget. Here\u2019s some reaction to the new growth figures, from Grant Thornton\u2019s Adam Jackson ... ... and liveblog reader Adrian Jenkins. Hammond says the ONS has been asked to work on a better assessment of human capital, so investment can be better directed. Hammond says the education secretary will release up to \u00a380m to help small firms take on apprentices. Hammond says the government is committed to training. Next month the construction skills fund will be open for bids. Hammond says \u201csubstantial progress\u201d has been made in the Brexit talks. He looks forward to another step forward at next week\u2019s EU summit. He says the Treasury will today publish information about how \u00a31.5bn set aside for Brexit planning will be spent. He says he will also announce how some of the \u00a3190m set aside for improving full-fibre broadband access will be spent. Hammond says the government will champion those who create jobs and wealth, not demonise them. McDonnell is open about his desire to undermine the market economy, he says. Hammond says the government reject that approach. He will go on supporting British businesses, he says. Hammond says next business rates valuation will be brought forward to 2021. He says there will be a review of how late payments can be avoided. Hammond says at this year\u2019s budget he will set a path for spending from 2020, with a spending review taking place in 2019. If in the autumn the public finances continue to reflect the improvements today\u2019s OBR report hints at, he will be able to increase public spending. Hammond says he is on course to increase public spending in the autumn budget. Hammond says there will be more pay for NHS staff if management and workers reach a deal on a pay agreement. Taxes have been cut for working people, he says. Fuel duty has been frozen for the eighth successive year. Here are the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s new forecasts, compared with the ones a few months ago: 2018: 1.5%, up from 1.4% expected in November\u2019s budget 2019: 1.3%, unchanged compared with November\u2019s budget 2020: 1.3%, unchanged compared with November\u2019s budget 2021: 1.4%, down from 1.5% expected in November\u2019s budget 2022: 1.5%, down from 1.6% expected in November\u2019s budget As you can see, growth is expected to be a little faster than previously forecast this year, but slower in 2021 and 2022. From the IFS director, Paul Johnson: Hammond says there is light at the end of the tunnel. But we must make sure it is not the shadow chancellor\u2019s train heading to a train wreck. He says he is not naive enough to think he has abolished the economic cycle. He says Tories want to get rid of the deficit to give the next generation a chance. But he does not think every available penny must be spent on debt reduction. And he does not agree with the \u201cfantasists\u201d from Labour who want to spend it all. Hammond reads out the borrowing figures: 2.2% in 2017-18 1.8% in 2018-19 1.6% in 2019-20 1.3% in 2020-21 1.1% in 2021-22 0.9% in 2022-23 He says in 2018-19 there will be a surplus on the current account. Hammond says the OBR expects inflation, at 3% above target, to fall to target (2%) over the next 12 months. Hammond says the OBR report out today forecasts rising growth. But forecasts are there to be beaten, he says. Hammond says universities are discovering new inventions, our culture spreads across the globe, and the tech sector is attracting investment from around the world. And he lists some leading apps \u2013 including \u201cMatt Hancock\u201d. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper says Britain\u2019s NHS cannot wait for the autumn budget \u2013 it needs more funds right now. Hammond says the wages of the lowest paid are up by almost 7% since 2015. There is solid progress towards building an economy that works for everyone. He says he rejects Labour\u2019s \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d about the economy. If there are any Eeyores in the chamber (the Daily Mail\u2019s nickname for him), they are on the Labour side, he says. He says he won\u2019t be producing a red book. But he can\u2019t speak for John McDonnell - a joke about the time the shadow chancellor brandished Mao\u2019s red book at the despatch box. Philip Hammond starts his statement by saying he is pleased to make his first spring statement. The UK was the only major economy to make major tax changes twice a year. This system gives businesses more certainty, he says. From Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam Good afternoon. I\u2019m joining the blog to cover the statement with Graeme. Philip Hammond is due to stand up at 12.30pm. But his speech will be very short. The Resolution Foundation has tweeted this: The foundation is ignoring the fact that Hammond has repeatedly said this statement will not be a \u201cfiscal event\u201d \u2013 Treasury speak for an announcement that involves actual decisions and tax changes. Instead the spring statement will be more consultative. (This was supposed to be the intention when Gordon Brown started delivering \u201cpre-budget reports\u201d in the autumn, but these quickly became mini budgets, not opportunities to float tentative proposals.) Paul Johnson, the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, points out that any improved borrowing forecasts today need to be compared with the pre-Brexit vote predictions: Philip Hammond has just left Downing Street, and is heading to parliament to deliver the spring statement. There\u2019s no \u2018red box\u2019 moment \u2013 the chancellor was carrying a red folder instead, and didn\u2019t hang around for many photos. Philip Hammond will start delivering the spring statement in 30 minutes (and wrap up before 1pm, if the hints of a short speech are true). We\u2019ll be collating the key points here, as well as tracking the details and reaction in this blog. Dr Faiza Shaheen, the director of the thinktank Class (Centre for Labour and Social Studies), wants Philip Hammond to boost investment and help workers today. Councils are almost bankrupt, workers are overworked and underpaid, and we are losing the race with our competitors in the G7. Britain can\u2019t afford more of the same failed dogma, especially given the uncertainty of Brexit. We need to see the public sector pay cap lifted, public services properly funded, and more borrowing for investment. They\u2019ve also provided a buzzword bingo game, to play along with: It may not be a full budget, but that\u2019s not stopped the painter Kaya Mar from his traditional appearance outside Downing Street, satirising our political class: s been handed a curate\u2019s egg by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development this morning. The OECD has raised its forecast for UK growth this year, but only to 1.3%. It then slows to 1.1% in 2019. That\u2019s weaker than last November\u2019s budget forecasts (which could be revised up today). In contrast, the global economy is expected to grow by 3.0% this year, with the eurozone expanding by 2.3%. The OECD says Brexit uncertainty and falling real wages are hurting UK growth, saying: High inflation continues to damp real household income growth and consumer spending, and business investment is slowing, amidst continued uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Prof John Maloney, an economist from the University of Exeter, believes Philip Hammond could invest more in public services and infrastructure. He explains: This is a good time to invest, with rates of interest so low, so it would make sense for the chancellor to take the brakes off a bit. But, as he has said, there are still economic challenges, and at the most he is likely to have only up to \u00a310bn extra to play with because of a recent increase in productivity. He could use it to increase spending, but also to cut taxes or let the deficit shrink faster. He could also cancel any spending cuts or tax rises pencilled in for the future. Philip Hammond\u2019s message to Britain today will be \u201cthe deficit is dead, long live the debt\u201d, says Torsten Bell, the head of the Resolution Foundation thinktank. In a blogpost, Bell explains how the elimination of the current budget deficit changes the landscape, but doesn\u2019t end Britain\u2019s problems. He writes: Let\u2019s start with the dying bit. The chancellor will read out the obituary for the deficit that public finances data have written since the autumn. In short, improved tax receipts mean borrowing this year looks set to come in between \u00a37 and \u00a311bn lower than the \u00a349.9bn projected by the Office for Budget Responsibility back in November. The result is that the current budget deficit (excluding capital expenditure) disappeared on a 12-monthly basis at the end of last year. The thing that has, rightly or wrongly, dominated British economic debate this decade is no more. But does that mean the chancellor will simply announce job done and that the public finances can retire from dominating our political economy? Far from it. Instead the central purpose of his speech tomorrow is almost certain to be kickstarting the debate that is likely to dominate fiscal policy for the next decade in the way the deficit has in the last \u2013 what is the level of public debt that Britain should be aiming for? And as this chart shows, a fiscal shock such as the next recession would drive debt up again... There\u2019s less of a media presence outside the House of Commons today, compared with the full-blown budget. That reflects the fact we\u2019re not expecting tax and spending changes today. Kirsty Blackman, the SNP\u2019s spokesperson on the economy, says the chancellor needs to do more to help struggling families. Speaking on Sky News, Blackman says: We\u2019ve still got one of the slowest growth rates in the G7. Things still look pretty bad. The uncertainty of Brexit means inflation is going up (as the weaker pound makes imports pricier) while public sector pay is not keeping pace, she adds. We can expect Hammond to highlight one recent milestone today \u2013 UK tax receipts are now covering day-to-day spending. Ian Jones of the Press Association has tweeted the details: The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, wants the chancellor to back plans for a \u00a31.3bn tidal power lagoon in Swansea Bay, off the south coast of Wales. In a video clip filmed during a trip to Wales, she says: It\u2019s about time we got some good news on the tidal lagoon. Come on Philip Hammond, give them what they want.\u201d If built, the scheme could generate enough electricity for 150,000 homes, and pave the way for similar green energy projects. However, the government has reportedly cooled on the idea. The spring statement is being overshadowed by the Salisbury nerve agent attack, after Theresa May told MPs yesterday that Russia was probably responsible. Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, has strongly backed May this morning \u2013 that\u2019s significant, as the White House declined to blame Russia yesterday. Moscow has until midnight to respond to the UK. My colleague Andy Sparrow is tracking that story in his Politics Live blog; he\u2019ll be along here later when Hammond\u2019s speech begins. Philip Hammond\u2019s attempt to help younger travellers is backfiring his morning. From today, 26-30 year olds can sign up to trial the new \u00a330 \u201cmillennial railcard\u201d, which offers one-third off rail journeys in the UK. Hammond announced it in last November\u2019s budget, saying 4.5 million people will benefit. However, only 10,000 are being released today, prompting a digital scrum as people try to sign up. And, predictably, the railcard website is failing to cope with the rush, leaving people disappointed and unhappy. Hannah Maundrell, the editor in chief of money.co.uk, says the basic idea is sound: Travelling by train can be very expensive and for younger people whose pay packets are already stretched it can be a massive financial burden. After the price hikes to rail fares in January, a 26-30 rail card could ease some financial pressure from millennials, especially those who rely on trains on a daily basis. There are some restrictions however this should offer at least some relief to financially stretched commuters who are currently stung by sky-high rail fares. In other current affairs news (ho ho), the opposition whips\u2019 office has been plunged into darkness by a power cut: The political blogger Guido Fawkes is providing support at this difficult time: One of the architects of the government\u2019s welfare changes is urging Philip Hammond to put more money into universal credit, reversing recent cuts. Iain Duncan Smith says working families need more help, as my colleague Anne Perkins explains: The former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has warned the chancellor that he risks undermining the whole purpose of welfare reform if he fails to reverse cuts to universal credit (UC) in his spring statement. Philip Hammond is under mounting pressure from across the party to use better than expected tax revenues to reverse cuts made after the 2015 election. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows that 340,000 people could be taken out of poverty by reversing the cuts to work allowances. \u2018I think he\u2019s under a lot of pressure. There are a lot of colleagues around who would like to see the money restored to UC as a step in the right direction,\u2019 said Duncan Smith. \u2018Hammond has got more money to spend. But will he? He says no \u2026 The answer to that is, we\u2019ll see.\u2019\u201d Universal credit bundles a series of benefits into a single payment; the scheme is struggling to hit the aim of making work pay more than welfare. The government is currently moving free school meals on to universal credit, meaning families earning less than \u00a37,400 per year will qualify. Labour say this means 1 million children will miss out \u2013 they\u2019ll try to block the move in a vote later today. Overnight, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has challenged Philip Hammond to end the \u2018misery\u2019 caused by the government\u2019s austerity programme. McDonnell said: Today the chancellor has a choice. He can choose to act and end the misery faced by many, or he can do nothing and continue to favour a privileged few. Our public services are at breaking point and many of our local councils are near bankruptcy. He needs to listen to the calls from across the political spectrum, including the Tory council leader in his own constituency, to end the financial crisis in our public sector. Philip Hammond must use today to act and end austerity. Our country cannot afford for him to continue to ignore the problems facing working households in our country. If his statement is one of boastful self-praise and not a recognition of the devastation faced by many in our country then he will have failed. If the chancellor refuses to act, then the next Labour government will end austerity and build a high-wage, high-skill economy for the many, not the few. Interestingly, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports that the cabinet has been discussing how to get more money into the NHS. That could include ring-fencing a new tax increase specifically for healthcare (a \u2018hypothecated\u2019 tax). She writes: Several senior sources say that, at the end of January, the cabinet discussed ways of getting more money into the health service in the long term. That included the foreign secretary\u2019s by now familiar argument about the hoped-for but disputed Brexit dividend. But more intriguingly for a Conservative government, I\u2019m told that the cabinet discussed the possibility of tax rises to fund more spending for the NHS, even a hypothecated tax, as spelled out by senior MPs like Nick Boles. However, we\u2019re not expecting any NHS spending changes today. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has identified the five key things to watch out for in today\u2019s spring statement. That includes slightly improved growth forecasts, as Larry explains: Hammond is likely to say that the outlook for growth is marginally better than it was three months ago. In November, the OBR said it was expecting the economy to expand by 1.5% in 2017 and by 1.4% in 2018. The latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics show that growth was actually 1.7% in 2017 and the consensus among City, business and academic economists is that something similar is likely in 2018. In the past, chancellors have used their statements to boast about the UK outperforming other economies, but that won\u2019t happen on this occasion given that Britain grew more slowly than all the other G7 countries in 2017 bar Italy. Copies of the spring statement have arrived at Downing Street this morning: Philip Hammond is also likely to launch several consultations today, which could lead to reforms and policy changes in the autumn budget. This could include an examination into how the tax system can be used to tackle the growing problem of plastic waste. This could build on the existing 5p levy on plastic bags. Other areas include the taxation of the UK\u2019s digital economy, tax simplification, artificial intelligence (AI) and the VAT system faced by small businesses. Good morning. Philip Hammond is about to create a little bit of history, when he unveils the UK\u2019s first ever spring statement. But in truth, today\u2019s statement will be as notable for what\u2019s not in it \u2013 we\u2019re not expecting any tax and spending changes, and the whole speech could be over in 20 minutes or so. That\u2019s because the chancellor of the exchequer, having moved the budget to the autumn, is determined to only have one fiscal event this year. So without any fiscal fireworks, Hammond will be focusing on an upbeat assessment of the state of the British economy today. He\u2019s expected to reveal that the UK economy could grow a little faster than expected this year, while borrowing is undershooting forecasts thanks to strong tax receipts. City experts predict that borrowing this financial year could be revised down by \u00a37bn, to \u00a343bn, while next year\u2019s could be trimmed from \u00a340bn to \u00a334bn. The forecast for economic growth this year is expected to be increased, from the lacklustre 1.4% forecast in November. Hammond can also boast that, for the first time since the financial crisis, Britain is bringing in enough tax to cover day-to-day spending. There are many places in the UK crying out for more investment \u2013 from the NHS and schools to transport infrastructure and the military. The chancellor, though, is expected to resist calls to ease austerity, and keep any extra fiscal powder dry until autumn\u2019s budget. As Hammond put it on Sunday: There is light at the end of the tunnel, because what we\u2019re about to see is debt starting to fall, after it\u2019s been growing for 17 continuous years. That\u2019s a very important moment for us. \u201cBut we are still in the tunnel at the moment. We have to get debt down. We\u2019ve got all sorts of other things we want to do. We\u2019ve taken a balanced approach over the last couple of fiscal events, using the flexibility we had to continue paying down debt but also to provide additional support to our public service.\u201d He\u2019s also tweeted a colourful explanation of what to expect: After Hammond sits down Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, will give its verdict on the chancellor\u2019s plans and the state of the UK economy. Importantly, the OBR is also expected to release its estimate of the cost of Brexit, including a forecast of yearly payments from the UK to the EU. That could end up being the big story of the day...

One of the 13 consultations he has published is on cash and digital payments, and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/689234/Cash_and_digital_payments_in_the_new_economy.pdf\">the document (pdf)</a> makes it clear that the Treasury increasingly thinks these coins are pointless. In a section of the consultation document leading up to the question \u201cdoes the current denominational mix (eight coins and four banknotes) meet your current and future needs?\u201d, the document says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the normal course of the cash cycle, many denominations fall out of circulation, for example, by being placed into savings jars. Surveys suggest that six in ten 1p and 2p coins are used in a transaction once before they leave the cash cycle. They are either saved, or in 8% of cases are thrown away. To meet demand created by such losses from circulation, in previous years the government and the Royal Mint have needed to produce and issue over 500 million 1p and 2p coins each year to replace those falling out of circulation.</p> </blockquote> <p>The document also suggests that \u00a350 notes could be abolished too.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the other end of the denominational scale the \u00a350 note is believed to be rarely used for routine purchases and is instead held as a store of value. There is a significant overseas demand for \u00a350 notes, with the notes used for some transactions, but mainly held as a store of value alongside other currencies such as the dollar and euro. There is also a perception among some that \u00a350 notes are used for money laundering, hidden economy activity, and tax evasion ...</p> <p>Though the value of the \u00a350 note is low compared to other countries\u2019 highest denominations, in order to attempt to tackle the hidden economy and illegitimate use of cash, and maintain the integrity of the currency, some countries have removed their highest value notes from circulation or replaced them with banknotes with more security features. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-03-13T15:36:21.689Z\">at 3.36pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5aa7e87be4b0ccc2e5bc5c79\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-13T15:15:58.468Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">OBR: Fairly high chance of a recession before 2023</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Although the OBR are forecasting slow growth over the next five years, they certainly aren\u2019t ruling out something worse.</strong></p> <p>The watchdog points out that there have been seven recessions over the last 61 years, suggesting that there\u2019s a 50:50 risk of one in the next five years.</p> <p>Thus,</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>...the probability of a cyclical shock occurring sometime over our forecast horizon is fairly high.</p> </blockquote> <p>The OBR also reminds us that neither the Treasury or the City actually forecast the great recession after the 2008 financial crisis:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As regards this final risk of an unexpected recession, it is salutary to remember that exactly 10 years ago \u2013 at the spring Budget of March 2008 \u2013 the Treasury forecast that the economy would grow by a cumulative 4 per cent in calendar years 2008 and 2009, whereas the latest outturn data show a drop of 4.6 per cent.</p> <p>As Chart 3.30 shows, only one of the 34 outside forecasters reporting their forecasts to the Treasury at the time predicted that real GDP would decline in either 2008 or 2009.

It\u2019s true that the country\u2019s debt burden is about to fall. It\u2019s also true that for the first time since the financial crisis the UK is borrowing only to invest, rather than to fund day-to-day spending. </p> <p>\u201cBut the Chancellor has made it clear that we\u2019ll remain in the tunnel for a while yet: there will be no fundamental reassessment of the UK\u2019s spending needs until 2020.

And while the budget deficit looks likely to come in almost \u00a35bn lower this year than we expected in November, the explanations for this imply smaller downward revisions for future years. As a result, the government\u2019s headroom against its fiscal targets is virtually unchanged.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Brexit, the fiscal watchdog says there\u2019s been less damage than feared:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The vote to leave the European Union appears to have slowed the economy, but by less than we expected immediately after the referendum \u2013 thanks in part to the willingness of consumers to maintain spending by reducing their saving. But it is important not to put too much weight on early estimates of economic activity either side of the referendum, not least because the bottom-up measures of GDP growth in the national accounts differ as to whether growth slowed down, speeded up or remained stable between 2016 and 2017.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on productivity, the OBR warns that recent improvements may not last.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The biggest surprise in the economic data released since November is that productivity growth \u2013 measured as output per hour \u2013 has been much stronger than expected. But that reflects a much weaker path for average hours worked, rather than stronger output or weaker employment growth. </p> <p>The fall in average hours over the second half of 2017 is the largest since mid-2011 and second largest since the financial crisis. But in 2011 the fall in hours and associated pick-up in productivity growth proved to be erratic and were soon reversed.

      "bodyText": "Women\u2019s activewear leggings, quiche and raspberries are in vogue while pork pies and bottles of lager drunk in nightclubs are out, in the annual shakeup of the UK\u2019s official shopping basket. Gym leggings, made popular by athleisure brands such as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Ivy Park, have been added to the basket used by the Office for National Statistics to measure inflation. \u201cAction cameras\u201d such as GoPros are now also included, as people film themselves during extreme sports and other activities. With more soft play areas opening across the country, children\u2019s soft play sessions have made it into the basket for the first time. Sit and ride toys such as ride-on cars and Wheely Bugs have replaced traditional tricycles, which are being sold in fewer shops. Phil Gooding, an ONS senior statistician, said: \u201cOver a period of time there has been a trend towards healthier living. Last year we added men\u2019s base layers which you wear under sports clothes.\u201d Last year also saw the inclusion of cycling helmets, gin and non-dairy milk, as hipster culture became more mainstream. This year, after the closure of a number of nightclubs across the UK in recent years, the \u201cbottle of lager in a nightclub\u201d has been dropped. Other items added to the 2018 basket include girls\u2019 leggings and body moisturising lotion \u2013 complementing facial cream, which is already included. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at consultancy KPMG, said: \u201cHealth and wellbeing is a key macro theme \u2013 the whole topic around athleisure, and yoga bottoms drive into that. \u201cHealth and beauty is one of the fastest-growing categories [in retail sales]. Generally in times of reduced consumer spend and pressure on disposable consumer incomes people want to treat themselves to look good, and spend more on facial creams and makeup.\u201d This is known as the lipstick effect \u2013 consumers opting for affordable treats rather than splashing out on big-ticket items such as furniture. Quiche and raspberries have been added to the basket for the first time, while pork pies and edam cheese are out, reflecting Britons\u2019 changing eating habits. Waitrose said its quiche and raspberry sales were up 15% in the past week, year on year, after it expanded its range to include gluten-free quiche. Michelle Slade, the delicatessen buyer at the supermarket, said: \u201cQuiche Lorraine was the epitome of food sophistication in the 70s. It is now seeing a revival.\u201d Gooding said the trend for ready-made meals also continued. Chilled mashed potato has made it into the inflation basket, about 30 years after dried mashed potato such as Smash was dropped. Waitrose said its prepared mash sales were up 14% in the past week. The pasty and pie category has given way to the more broadly defined cooked pastry-based savoury snack, reflecting the wider range available at takeaway outlets such as Greggs. Peaches and nectarines, which are available for only eight months of the year, have been removed, leaving avocados and plums to represent stone fruit. Leg waxing and ATM charges have also been dropped. High chairs have been added to represent nursery furniture, nearly two decades after cots exited the shopping basket. The basket also reflects the rapid pace of technological change. The rise of the smartphone means digital camcorders have been ousted, while digital media players such as Chromecast and Apple TV have replaced digital TV recorders and receivers such as Sky and Freeview boxes. Smaller televisions have made way for larger, 39- or 40-in-plus screens. Martin said the status symbols of old, such as expensive cameras and camcorders, had been replaced by smartphones. \u201cIt\u2019s your life bundle, with so many functionalities,\u201d he added. Gooding said 36 items were changed this year out of a total basket of 714. The ONS updates the basket of goods and services once a year to reflect changes in shopping habits, and uses it to calculate inflation. The headline inflation rate was 3% in January compared with 1.8% a year ago, indicating the increasing squeeze on living costs.

      "body": "<p>Women\u2019s activewear leggings, quiche and raspberries are in vogue while pork pies and bottles of lager drunk in nightclubs are out, in the annual shakeup of the UK\u2019s official shopping basket.</p> \n<p>Gym leggings, made popular by athleisure brands such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/01/beyonce-stamps-her-unmistakable-brand-on-sportswear-fashion\">Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Ivy Park</a>, have been added to the basket used by the Office for National Statistics to measure inflation. \u201cAction cameras\u201d such as GoPros are now also included, as people film themselves during extreme sports and other activities.</p> \n<p>With more soft play areas opening across the country, children\u2019s soft play sessions have made it into the basket for the first time. Sit and ride toys such as ride-on cars and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://wheelybug.com/order_now.php\">Wheely Bugs</a> have replaced traditional tricycles, which are being sold in fewer shops.</p> \n<p>Phil Gooding, an ONS senior statistician, said: \u201cOver a period of time there has been a trend towards healthier living. Last year we added men\u2019s base layers which you wear under sports clothes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last year also saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/14/uk-inflation-ons-basket-goods-gin-cycling-helmets\">inclusion of cycling helmets, gin and non-dairy milk</a>, as hipster culture became more mainstream. </p> \n<p>This year, after the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2016/aug/14/young-people-night-time-social-activities-museums-running-tim-lewis\">closure of a number of nightclubs</a> across the UK in recent years, the \u201cbottle of lager in a nightclub\u201d has been dropped.</p> \n<p>Other items added to the 2018 basket include girls\u2019 leggings and body moisturising lotion \u2013 complementing facial cream, which is already included. </p> \n<p>Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at consultancy KPMG, said: \u201cHealth and wellbeing is a key macro theme \u2013 the whole topic around athleisure, and yoga bottoms drive into that. </p> \n<p>\u201cHealth and beauty is one of the fastest-growing categories [in retail sales]. Generally in times of reduced consumer spend and pressure on disposable consumer incomes people want to treat themselves to look good, and spend more on facial creams and makeup.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is known as the lipstick effect \u2013 consumers opting for affordable treats rather than splashing out on big-ticket items such as furniture.</p> \n<p>Quiche and raspberries have been added to the basket for the first time, while pork pies and edam cheese are out, reflecting Britons\u2019 changing eating habits.</p> \n<p>Waitrose said its quiche and raspberry sales were up 15% in the past week, year on year, after it expanded its range to include gluten-free quiche. Michelle Slade, the delicatessen buyer at the supermarket, said: \u201cQuiche Lorraine was the epitome of food sophistication in the 70s. It is now seeing a revival.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gooding said the trend for ready-made meals also continued. Chilled mashed potato has made it into the inflation basket, about 30 years after dried mashed potato such as Smash was dropped. Waitrose said its prepared mash sales were up 14% in the past week.</p> \n<p>The pasty and pie category has given way to the more broadly defined cooked pastry-based savoury snack, reflecting the wider range available at takeaway outlets such as Greggs. </p> \n<p>Peaches and nectarines, which are available for only eight months of the year, have been removed, leaving avocados and plums to represent stone fruit. Leg waxing and ATM charges have also been dropped.</p> \n<p>High chairs have been added to represent nursery furniture, nearly two decades after cots exited the shopping basket.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The basket also reflects the rapid pace of technological change. The rise of the smartphone means digital camcorders have been ousted, while digital media players such as Chromecast and Apple TV have replaced digital TV recorders and receivers such as Sky and Freeview boxes. Smaller televisions have made way for larger, 39- or 40-in-plus screens.</p> \n<p>Martin said the status symbols of old, such as expensive cameras and camcorders, had been replaced by smartphones. \u201cIt\u2019s your life bundle, with so many functionalities,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Gooding said 36 items were changed this year out of a total basket of 714.</p> \n<p>The ONS updates the basket of goods and services once a year to reflect changes in shopping habits, and uses it to calculate inflation.

      "bodyText": "A retail body has suggested the Fair Work Commission freeze the minimum wage, meaning Australia\u2019s lowest paid workers would receive a real cut to their pay. Submissions to the commission for its annual review closed on Tuesday, with calls ranging from the National Retail Association\u2019s (NRA) call for a 0% pay increase up to the Australian Council of Trade Unions\u2019 call for a 7.2% rise, or $50 a week for the lowest paid. The decision \u2013 which sets the pay of 2.3 million Australians who are paid the minimum wage or award rates \u2013 will apply from July. The FWC will deliberate as Labor and the unions take up wage stagnation as a rallying cause against the Turnbull government. In its submission Labor asked for \u201ca fair and economically responsible real increase\u201d, more than the current rate of inflation of 1.9%. Labor said the pay rise should take into account \u201cflatlining wages, rising cost of living pressures and record high levels of household debt relative to incomes, continuing and persistent earnings inequality, and the gender pay gap\u201d. Labor\u2019s employment spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said \u201cthere is a pressing need to restore the link between hard work and fair reward\u201d. The Turnbull government\u2019s submission gave evidence about the state of the economy but did not nominate its preferred size of pay rise. It noted that labour market conditions had strengthened, with unemployment down to 5.5%, but that there was still \u201cspare capacity\u201d with an underemployment rate of 8.3%. The government said wage inflation was \u201csubdued\u201d at 2.1% but was expected to rise to 2.75% in the year to the June 2019 quarter. It said the commission\u2019s decision \u201cshould be consistent with the continuation of recent positive economic developments to support economic growth, job growth and productivity growth\u201d. Employer groups including the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have called for minimum and award wage rises of 1.8% and 1.9%, in line with inflation. The ACCI chief executive, James Pearson, blasted the ACTU\u2019s pay claim as \u201cunrealistic\u201d given the \u201ctough conditions that small businesses face\u201d. Pearson said that employers \u201crecognise the need for wages to rise as the cost of living rises \u2026 but for businesses to be able to stay open and retain employees, the right balance has to be met\u201d. The NRA asked the commission to \u201cgive full and genuine consideration to the prospect of a 0% change to minimum wages\u201d in the 2018 review. Its chief executive, Dominique Lamb, said changes to the retail and fast food awards that introduced overtime pay in January meant retailers\u2019 could not afford pay rises. She warned the commission that pay rises above inflation would leave employees worse off because employers would cut shifts or make redundancies to pay for them. In its 2017 minimum wage decision, the FWC said \u201cmodest and regular wage increases\u201d did not increase unemployment. The Greens employment spokesman, Adam Bandt, said his party \u201cstrongly supports calls to lift the minimum wage\u201d. Defending the Greens\u2019 decision not to make a submission, Bandt said elected lawmakers \u201cshould cut out the middle man and just change laws to make Australia more equal\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Donald Trump took the unusual step of blocking the Singaporean chip maker Broadcom\u2019s bid for its US rival Qualcomm on Monday night, citing national security concerns and ending what would have been the biggest-ever tech deal. Announcing the extraordinary move, Trump said \u201cthere is credible evidence\u201d that allowing the Singapore-based company to take control of Qualcomm could lead to \u201caction that threatens to impair the national security of the United States\u201d. The decision underlines the economic protectionism of the Trump administration and comes just days after the US announced it would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in order to protect US firms. Last November, Trump said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to welcome Broadcom to the US. At a White House event with the CEO, Hock Tan, he called Broadcom \u201cone of the great, great companies\u201d. Trump noted the company already employed over 7,500 workers in the US and said: \u201cWe are looking forward to seeing that number grow very substantially.\u201d The president\u2019s intervention follows a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius), which told the companies on Sunday that it was minded to refer the deal to Trump for rejection. Following the $117bn bid, Broadcom was in the process of relocating its legal base to the US and had hoped to complete the move by 3 April, but Cfius said in its letter that it had identified \u201cpotential national security concerns\u201d and the company had not given the agency enough notice of its decision to move its legal base to the US. \u201cBroadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,\u201d it said in a statement in response to the decision. Had the company become US-domiciled, it could have argued that the takeover fell outside of Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction. The Trump administration\u2019s concerns appear to be focused more on China than Singapore \u2013 that allowing a US semiconductor company to be acquired by a foreign company would weaken the US\u2019s position while benefitting China. The Trump administration is concerned about the US losing ground in 5G technology, the latest iteration of wireless technology, which is expected to greatly improve wireless networks and prove essential to the next generation of self-driving cars as well as other technologies. According to a letter from Cfius seen by the Washington Post, the US was concerned that Broadcom would cut back on research and development at Qualcomm following the takeover. Such a move would offer an advantage to China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, a major producer of mobile chips. Earlier this month, in response to those fears, Broadcom announced the creation of a $1.5bn fund \u201cto ensure US leadership in future wireless technology\u201d. Broadcom also promised not to sell off any \u201ccritical national security assets\u201d to foreign firms. The decision is the latest in a series of decisions by the Trump administration to block foreign takeovers. Following a Cfius review, the US stopped Moneygram\u2019s sale to an affiliate of China\u2019s internet conglomerate Alibaba Group and the sale of Lattice Semiconductor to an investment firm with ties to the Chinese government. \u201cThe proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,\u201d said the presidential order, signed by Trump.

      "bodyText": "It is easy to understand why Aviva Investors have sided with Melrose in the great \u00a38bn bid battle for GKN. The fund management house has a 5.4% stake in Melrose and a holding of only 1.2% in GKN. David Cumming, Aviva\u2019s chief investment officer, may genuinely believe that Melrose\u2019s \u201cmeasured execution of value\u201d is best for shareholders in both companies, but it\u2019s not a high-risk gamble from his point of view. If Melrose were to grab control of GKN on the cheap, that\u2019s great news for his funds. Aviva won\u2019t be alone in having positions in both companies, which makes the outcome of this takeover scrap hard to predict. For some investors, it\u2019s all about which management team, and which break-up plan, to prefer. For those that own only GKN shares, notions like fundamental value also matter. On that old-fashioned yardstick, Melrose\u2019s offer is too low. The bidder, with its shares down 5% on Monday after modestly improving its terms, is offering GKN shareholders only 442p, mostly in the form of its own paper. That may look impressive against a GKN share price that was trading at 326p before the fun started, but January\u2019s price ignores the various fireworks subsequently launched from GKN\u2019s embattled boardroom. The pyrotechnics show hasn\u2019t gone off perfectly, it should be said. GKN\u2019s promise to demerge was the correct defence, but Dana of the US is only a semi-convincing partner for Driveline, the automotive division. GKN shareholders are being asked to take a 47% stake in a US-listed company with a less than illustrious corporate history. Owning US-listed paper will be a problem for some UK funds. Yet even an imperfect $6bn (\u00a34.8bn) automotive deal has underpinned the value in one half of GKN. It also solved GKN\u2019s wider pensions problem, whereas Melrose is still scratching around without agreement with the trustees. The Dana proposal also gives GKN shareholders a clearer picture of what they would own directly and reasonably soon \u2013 a pure aerospace company that, despite recent self-inflicted calamities in the US, has high-quality assets and a long order book. It still requires a few generous assumptions to value GKN at 500p, as management does, but some City analysts share the assessment. Either way, one can be confident that shares in an independent GKN would not fall to their pre-bid level. A price around 400p might be nearer the mark. If so, Melrose\u2019s final offer at 442p \u2013 giving GKN\u2019s shareholders a 60% share of the pie, versus 57% previously \u2013 just looks plain mean. Hostile bids are meant to mean decent takeover premiums. The one on offer here is miserable. GKN should never have found itself in a position of extreme vulnerability, of course. The board, led since 2012 by the chairman, Mike Turner, has not served shareholders well. But, barring an unlikely 11th-hour political intervention, it\u2019s a choice between the GKN\u2019s breakup plan and Melrose\u2019s offer. The latter\u2019s breakup plan would take longer to execute; it probably carries as many executive risks because Melrose\u2019s crew, even if they\u2019re well regarded by investors, haven\u2019t played in this league before; and there would be more debt around. The gamble might be attractive to GKN if the takeover terms were decent. But they\u2019re not. Melrose\u2019s offer may succeed \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t deserve to. Why hasn\u2019t Aim hailed Chi-Med success? Two companies on London\u2019s junior stock market, the Alternative Investment Market, claim about 90% of the attention. That\u2019s understandable, since fashion retailer Asos, the biggest, and tonic water upstart Fever-Tree, the third biggest, are well-known firms that have been superb investments. What\u2019s the second biggest? It\u2019s Hutchison China MediTech, or Chi-Med, which has performed just as well. The firm first was mentioned in this column as long ago as 2009 when share price was 200p. Now the shares are \u00a351.40, giving a stock market value of \u00a33.45bn. Chi-Med is the first serious attempt to build a Chinese-based international pharmaceutical firm, and the project is plainly going well. Monday\u2019s full-year numbers continued the smooth progress. Fruquintinib, a colorectal cancer treatment being developed with US pharma giant Lilly, could be launched in China later this year. Savolitinib, for lung cancer, is partnered with AstraZeneca and being tested in combination with some of the UK\u2019s firm\u2019s established drugs. Nothing is guaranteed in the drug-development game, but Chi-Med\u2019s soaring valuation points to investor interest, especially in the US, where the firm now has joint listing on Nasdaq. The Aim market has its critics, but the criticism in this case is that London has not done enough to shout about a big success. If there were more Chi-Meds, nobody would care about titans such as Saudi Aramco.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hotels, restaurants, pubs and bars are preparing to hire at the fastest pace in a year, with many being forced to act due to growing fears of an exodus of migrant workers as Britain leaves the European Union. Despite a downturn in consumer spending forcing restaurant chains to close outlets en masse, the hospitality sector is expecting a busier period for hiring staff than any other part of the economy over the coming three months. According to a poll of 2,102 employers across nine different industry sectors by the recruitment firm ManpowerGroup, which is used by the Bank of England as an early indicator for changes in the jobs market, companies overall are at their most optimistic about hiring staff for more than a year. A net balance of 6% said they were planning to increase staff levels rather than make cuts over the coming three months, led by hiring in the hospitality sector, where a balance of +16% of firms running hotels, pubs and restaurants say they need more staff. James Hick, the managing director of ManpowerGroup Solutions, said the findings represented a \u201cdefinite direct link\u201d to EU workers leaving the UK. \u201cNormally you would link hiring intentions to growth, however this time we\u2019re looking at a declining sector,\u201d he said. \u201cOur view on the data is that it shows how desperate employers are to fill vacancies in an industry that is heavily dependent on immigration.\u201d The report comes as the Jamie\u2019s Italian restaurant chain is closing a third of its sites and Byron Burger is shutting up to 20 branches as part of a rescue plan. As many as a quarter of the 3 million staff in the hospitality industry are EU nationals and there have been repeat warnings of an exodus after Brexit that could lead to massive gaps in the workforce. According to official government figures, there have been early signs of EU workers leaving Britain since the referendum. Net migration to Britain has fallen by the largest amount since records began, according to the Office for National Statistics, with EU nationals accounting for three-quarters of those who chose to return to their native country.",
