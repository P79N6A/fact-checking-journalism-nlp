      "bodyText": "It remains early days for assessing Donald Trump\u2019s economic plans, not least because of the difficulty in separating the serious policies from the wilder campaigning rhetoric, but the bond market seems clear on the central point: the president-elect intends to cut tax taxes, increase spending and deregulate. Investors know what that cocktail produces. It boosts growth, at least for a while, and it generates inflation. Even famed liberal economist Paul Krugman has switched from predicting an imminent global recession. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if economic growth actually accelerates for a couple of years,\u201d he says, because the \u201cdire effects of Trumpism\u201d will take time to become manifest. In the bond market, a mini-rout is under way as yields on government debt climb across the board. US 1o-year Treasuries were yielding 1.35% in the summer and 1.85% on the eve of Trump\u2019s victory; now they are 2.19%, a huge move in such a short space of time. In the UK, the 10-year gilt yield, which fell as low as 0.5% in the same summer lull, is now 1.4%. A return of more normal yields, encouraged by the prospect of fiscal stimulus and higher rates of growth, is just what the world has been crying out for, many at both ends of the political spectrum would agree. Years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing haven\u2019t rebooted the global economy, so try something different. Well, yes, but let\u2019s not pretend that such fiscal medicine is risk-free, especially when taken in the dosage Trump intends. A cut in the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, and $550bn to be spent on new infrastructure, represent crisis-style responses. But, as JP Morgan\u2019s chief global strategist David Kelly argues, the idea that the US is massively underperforming its potential for growth and requires a big fiscal stimulus is wrong. The US economy is at virtual full employment and the federal budget deficit is already rising. Indeed, the US Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated in September that Trump\u2019s plans for massive personal and corporate tax cuts plus more defence spending would push the US national debt to 105% of GDP by 2026, against 77% currently and 86% assumed for 2026 under current laws. \u201cThe truth is, boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless,\u201d argues Kelly. The inflationary impact of a spending spree looks likely to be even more severe if the US is simultaneously blocking skilled immigration and imposing 1930s-style trade tariffs around the world. A big boom followed by an almighty bust? That script seems very plausible. Nor should we surprised if there are accidents on the way. In the early days of quantitative easing, central banks used to warn us that the exit from the bond bubble they created would have to be managed carefully because of its capacity to destabilise the financial system. You can understand why they worried: if government debt, supposedly the safest form of asset, is suddenly imposing double-digit losses on holders, there will be consequences. Prepare to see them soon: the bond bubble has been 30 years in the making and it won\u2019t deflate painlessly. William Hill back in the race after failed merger It should not be news that a gambling company is appointing to its board some non-executives with experience of the gambling industry. It is at William Hill, where the boardroom is currently populated by non-specialists, a shortcoming that was cruelly exposed when shareholders shot down the board\u2019s half-baked idea of exploring a \u00a34.6bn merger with Amaya, a Canadian online poker company. John O\u2019Reilly, formerly of Ladbrokes and Coral, and Mark Brooker, former chief operating officer at Betfair, will improve the board\u2019s gambling quota from zero to two. Robin Terrell, a former digital wizard for Tesco, also looks a sensible hire. Gareth Davis, chairman for the past six years, did not explain why the obvious gap in expertise had not been filled previously but he has heard the criticisms and responded, which may quell the calls for his own departure. Full rehabilitation will depend on the two other factors. First, the company needs to avoid further trading upsets while Davis completes his search for a chief executive to relieve Philip Bowman, whose own lack of a gambling background makes him an imperfect candidate. On that front, news that full-year operating profits are still expected to arrive towards the top of a \u00a3260m to \u00a3280m range gets a tick. The other factor will be evidence that William Hill won\u2019t have its head turned by the next flashy Amaya-style proposal. The new boardroom appointments suggest self-help is indeed the priority again. Good, but the path to this point should not have been so roundabout.",

      "bodyText": "Fears about the inflationary potential of Donald Trump\u2019s planned tax cuts and infrastructure spending have sent shock waves through the world\u2019s bond markets, as investors take fright at the prospect of higher than expected interest rates in the years ahead. Central banks are braced to suffer fresh losses on their vast holdings of government debt after the sell-off that saw $1tn wiped off the value of bonds last week intensified on Monday. Bond prices fell for a sixth day running in the UK, pushing the yield on government gilts to their highest level since the weeks leading up to the EU referendum, and US bond yields reached levels last seen in December 2015. Bond yields, the rate of interest an investor gets, rise when bond prices go down. The sell-off has been triggered by concerns about the impact of Trump\u2019s economic policies when he arrives in the White House in January. Share prices have risen since the US election on optimism that stronger growth will result in higher corporate profits. At one stage on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average \u2013 which measures the value of the top 30 US companies \u2013 was up nearly 90 points at a new intra-day high of 18934 points. The president-elect is promising tax cuts for both companies and individuals together with a $550bn boost to infrastructure spending in order to raise the US growth rate from 2.5% to 3.5% a year. Financial markets, however, think the reflationary package will also push up the cost of living and force the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to raise interest rates more rapidly than had been expected. Adam Slater of Oxford Economics said: \u201cThe US election has prompted a sharp re-pricing of many financial assets, based on expectations of a significant shift in US fiscal policy. Markets now expect medium-term inflation and interest rates, consistent with a hefty fiscal stimulus.\u201d Slater said that the decline in bond prices evident since the summer had been intensified by Trump\u2019s win. The total return on a 10-year US Treasury bond was down 7% in the past four months, comparable to the so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d of 2013, when global bond prices slumped on fears of higher interest rates from the Fed. For the past eight years, central banks have held borrowing costs at record-low levels and used vast bond-buying programmes known as quantitative easing to pump money into struggling economies. Central bank buying has limited the supply of bonds and pushed up their price. Since Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton, bond prices have gone into reverse as investors contemplate a period of political uncertainty, a possible trade war between the US and China, and the risk that the world\u2019s biggest economy will overheat. David Marsh, the managing director of the thinktank Omfif, said: \u201cCentral bankers have worried for some time that an otherwise welcome international growth revival would depress inflated bond prices and confront central banks with substantial losses on government securities acquired during bond-buying sprees since 2009. \u201cEurope is particularly exposed, since the ECB started buying only relatively late, in March 2015, at a time when bond prices were already very high. \u201cA sharp rise in sovereign yields in Europe since Trump\u2019s win last Tuesday, together with an increase in euro area inflation expectations to an eight-month high, will buttress opposition on the ECB\u2019s governing council to an extension in ECB quantitative easing beyond March 2017.\u201d The yield on 10-year US Treasury bills has hit its highest level since January, rising to 2.23% from 2.1% last week. Shorter-dated two-year debt and long-dated 30-year bonds also hit their weakest points since the start of the year. The knock-on effects from lower bond prices in the US have been felt in the UK and other European markets. Bond prices rose strongly in the UK after the Brexit vote as nervous investors looked for safe havens and anticipated that interest rates would be cut to boost activity. But the yield on 10-year gilts has tripled since the trough of 0.5% in early August. Simon MacAdam, an economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cTreasury yields have risen sharply since the US elections, reflecting anticipation of a major fiscal stimulus under President Trump. But while we are nudging up our forecasts for government bond yields in Europe, we still don\u2019t expect that they will rise as fast as in the US.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The prospect of increased US spending and rising interest rates has pushed the dollar index above 100 for the first time since December. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: The dollar index does appear to be a little bit overbought around these levels, though technically the trend looks strong as it resides inside a bullish channel and above the main moving averages. So, a short-term pullback would not come as a surprise to me, before we potentially see higher levels. That being said, the 100 level has now been tested several times since March 2015. The more a level is tested, the more likely it will break in the direction of the test...It should be noted that if the dollar were to rise further then this will be bad news for US stock. Up until now, they have been rising and falling in unison. This relationship cannot continue indefinitely as the appreciating dollar is supposed to weigh on company earnings. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. European bond yields are unlikely to rise as fast as those in the US following Donald Trump\u2019s shock presidential election victory, says Capital Economics Simon MacAdam: In the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election, we are nudging up our forecasts for government bond yields in Europe. But we still don\u2019t expect that they will rise as fast as in the US. Treasury yields have risen sharply in the US since the election there on 8th November. This reflects investors\u2019 expectations of a major fiscal stimulus under President Trump, which would both increase the supply of bonds and mainly boost inflation at this stage of the US business cycle. (See our Global Markets Update, \u201cNew \u2013 even more bearish \u2013 forecasts for Treasuries\u201d, published on Friday.) Although government bond yields have also risen in Europe, the increases have been significantly smaller than in the US and we expect European government bonds to continue doing better than Treasuries in the months ahead. For a start, there is a far lower chance of a major fiscal loosening in Europe. Granted, we expect UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond to scale back the pace of fiscal tightening over the coming years in his Autumn Statement later this month. But this is likely to fall short of an outright fiscal stimulus. And there is even less scope for a fiscal expansion in the euro-zone. Second, a given amount of fiscal loosening would generate less inflationary pressure in Europe compared to the US. This is because there is a greater degree of spare capacity in the economies of Europe, particularly in the euro-zone. Third, following the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, Trump\u2019s victory has stoked fears of more populist revolts occurring down the line in parts of Europe, including in France, in spring\u2019s presidential election. While Bunds have arguably already benefited to some degree from the uncertainty, any increase in perceived political risk should further boost safe-haven demand, thereby helping to contain yields there. Despite Wall Street coming off its best levels after earlier hitting a new peak, European markets have managed to end the day in positive territory. With bond markets under pressure on the basis that Donald Trump\u2019s presidency could see increased spending and a rise in inflation, equities have been a partial beneficiary. In the bond market, Italian 10 year yield rose 18 basis points at one time to their highest since September 2015, German 30 year yields were at their highest for six months while US 10 yields were at their highest since December. However bond prices have since regained some ground, meaning yields are off their highest levels. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The recent resurgence of inflation expectations, coupled with a remarkably buoyant stock market, point towards a likely rate hike in December, and this has helped fuel the drive towards the dollar and away from US treasuries. In equities, the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 22.75 points or 0.34% higher at 6753.18 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.24% to 10,693.69 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.43% at 4508.55 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.22% at 8658.2 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.75% to 16,686.33 amid nervousness ahead of the country\u2019s forthcoming referendum In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.47% to 579.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 22 points at 18824, having earlier hit an intra-day record of 18934. US technology stocks are missing out on the market\u2019s current rally, on fears that some of Donald Trump\u2019s policies will prove unfavourable. Talk of the president-elect slapping tariffs on Chinese goods raised fears of retaliation which could hit the likes of Apple\u2019s expansion plans. Even the prospect of tax breaks allowing such companies to repatriate some of their cash piles has not proved to be much support for the shares. Nor are the major tech companies likely to benefit from Trump\u2019s proposed programme of infrastructure spending, said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets: Tech stocks like Facebook and Netflix won\u2019t get any government contracts in a rise in infrastructure spending but Chinese expansion plans are at risk by possible trade tariffs. So Apple is currently down 3.2% while Facebook has fallen 3.7%. More fallout from the strong dollar: oil prices are heading lower again. It is not just the dollar hitting crude, however. Investors had been hoping that a key Opec meeting at the end of this month would agree measures to curb output and thus support prices. But the closer the meeting gets, the more the doubts grow and put pressure on the crude price. So Brent is currently down 1.59% at $44.04 a barrel while West Texax Intermediate has slipped 1.68% to \u00a342.68. Over in Greece, government officials are preparing for a new round of talks with inspectors representing the country\u2019s foreign lenders following Barack Obama\u2019s extraordinary call for Athens to be granted \u201cmeaningful debt relief.\u201d Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Rarely has there been such desire from a sitting government in Athens to conclude a review with auditors representing the bodies that have thrice bailed out Greece since 2010. Highlighting that sentiment, the new government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters earlier that differences between the two are \u201cvery small.\u201d The talks, which begin in earnest tomorrow, will focus on an overhaul of labour laws including annulment of collective work agreements and mass firings (a red line many in the ruling left wing Syriza party), privatisations and primary surplus targets for 2019. Next year\u2019s budget will also be discussed. The goal \u2013 one dismissed as untenable by most \u2013 is for the inspection tour to be wrapped up in a matter of days in the hope that debt relief talks can begin when euro zone finance ministers hold their last meeting of the year on December 5. If debt-serving costs are brought down, it will reduce the need for the country to achieve a 3.5% primary surplus by 2018 \u2013 a target set by lenders but almost unequivocally derided as impossible to meet. Ahead of president Barack Obama\u2019s arrival in the Greek capital on Tuesday the government has gone out of its way to play up the two-day visit with Tzanakopoulos saying today that it had not only been heartened by his intervention on the matter of Greek debt but calling the tour one of great significance. The trip, which will see the US president flying straight to Berlin after Athens, is expected to be heavy on symbolism as Obama\u2019s last state visit abroad. To date only the IMF has highlighted the problem of a debt load it has long called \u201cunmanageable.\u201d Greek officials now hope the US leader will bring pressure to bear on the German chancellor when he, too, highlights the issue in talks between the two on Wednesday. The pound continues to weaken against the dollar as the US currency benefits from talk of an interest rate rise in December after all, despite the shock US election result. Sterling has extended its falls and is now down 1.17% at $1.2450. But against the euro, the pound is holding steady, up 0.09% at \u20ac1.1622. US markets are on the rise at the open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a new record high - just two trading days after the previous peak. The Dow is currently up around 45 points or o.24% at 18893, having reached 18,918, ahead of the previous record of 18,873 hit last Thursday, as equities continued to welcome Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, even if bond markets do not. The S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.21% while the Nasdaq composite added 0.15% initially. Time for a quick catch up. The bond market has suffered fresh losses today as investors rapidly adjust to the prospect of Donald Trump taking control of the world\u2019s largest economy. Debt prices have fallen sharply again, adding to last week\u2019s $1trn bloodbath, on the prospect that we\u2019re entering a world of higher inflation, interest rate hikes, political uncertainty and possibly trade disputes too. The selloff has hit US bond prices. The yield on 10-year Treasury bills has hit its highest level since January, rising to 2.23% from 2.1% last week. Shorter-dated two-year debt, and long-dated 30-year bonds, also hit their weakest points since the start of the year. Investors are betting that Trump\u2019s infrastructure programme, and his plan to cut taxes, will reflate the US economy. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, believes the bond market selloff could intensify: \u201cThe sentiment surrounding a rate hike has been flip-flopping and that only makes bond buying, especially at around the 1% mark for two-year bills, a more appealing proposition. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pledge to pile resources into infrastructure to \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 has arguably upped the risk of investing in Treasury yields. The 11-month high of 1% might not be the high water mark for 2016 as Trump\u2019s economic policy is put into action.\u201d [remember: bond yield rise when price fall] UK borrowing costs are also being driven up. The 10-year gilt yield has hit its highest level since May, at 1.45%. The dollar is strengthening, hitting an 11-month high against the euro, and against a broad basket of currencies. It\u2019s also gained one cent against the UK pound, at around $1.25. And the markets reckon that the Federal Reserve is nailed on to raise US interest rates in December: But....a string of experts are voicing concern about Trumponomics: JP Morgan\u2019s David Kelly thinks slashing taxes and driving up borrowing risks pushing the US deficit into dangerous heights, and simply isn\u2019t necessary right now. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers thinks the infrastructure plan appears to be badly designed And George Magnus, UBS\u2019s well-respected former chief economist, fears that Trump could trigger pain through the global economy if he takes a protectionist approach. Over the weekend, Trump started to step back from some of his more extreme positions. That wall between America and Mexico might be downgraded to a mere fence, in places, for example. And investors find that sort of u-turn encouraging, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: Markets are showing that investors continue to believe the fiscal policy plans by Mr Trump and they want to pile their bets in equities. A risk on trade has become the famous trade amid traders and hence for the past week, since Trump\u2019s victory, we are seeing the precious metal along with other safe haven like the Japanese yen selling off sharply. Mr Trump has delivered many watered down versions of his controversial views over the weekend. This has restored further confidence that the person in charge of the biggest economy of the world, has started to think more logically. It is this certainty which investors are applauding. However... appointing the head of far-right website Breitbart as \u201cchief strategist and senior counselor\u201d doesn\u2019t suggest Trump is backing away from the view that appalled liberal critics. Donald Trump\u2019s shock win is an alarm call to moderate politicians to improve workers\u2019 conditions, argues the head of the International Labour Organisation. Guy Ryder believes that the US election result, and the Brexit vote, show that many workers feel sidelined and \u2018dispossessed\u2019 in today\u2019s economy: He tells us: \u201cThe societies we all live in are distributing the benefits of globalisation and economic processes extraordinarily unfairly and people think they are getting a raw deal. \u201cIt is the people who feel they haven\u2019t benefited from globalisation and from the EU, from the way things are organised. This is the revolt of the dispossessed in that regard.\u201d Ryder was speaking as the ILO launches a new report, showing that temporary work, agency work, precarious self-employment and other non-standard forms of employment have all spread. We now have a hat-trick of warnings about Donald Trump\u2019s economic plans. George Magnus, the former chief economist of UBS, is very concerned that the next president could kick off a trade war that harms America\u2019s economy, and the rest of the world too. In a new blogpost, Magnus writes: Trump\u2019s vehemently anti-free trade rhetoric has included the threat to rip up or change NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Association agreement, including the possibility of levying tariffs on Mexico, and this, on top of erecting the wall, or otherwise restricting immigration. He has threatened China with heavy tariffs as a punitive measure for the now redundant charge of manipulating its currency, and opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that was central to President Obama\u2019s pivot to Asia. Even now, China is busy trying to get Asia-Pacific countries to sign up to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, its own version of America\u2019s TPP. If Trump proved to be a real isolationist and walked away from open trading agreements, and imposed trade barriers, he might imagine this that would protect American workers and bring jobs home. But empirically we know this just tends to lead to retailation, higher inflation and costs, and job losses. We do have cause to worry that without America to defend and promote a liberal global trade and investment regime, economic damage and impoverishment would spread through the global economy. Magnus does believe that America would benefit from targeted infrastructure spending plan, but he\u2019s less impressed by Trump\u2019s tax cuts, as they\u2019ll mainly benefit the better off. And the other BIG worry is that Trump could drives up the US national debt to alarming levels. Magnus says: The other major concern about Trumponomics is about a mishandled fiscal expansion and unfunded tax cuts that would entail a substantially wider fiscal deficit and more rapid expansion of public debt. The bipartisan and independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has calculated that what little we know of Trump\u2019s programmes, including repeal of Obamacare, could put about $3-4 trillion on to the outstanding level of public debt, now standing at $14 trilion. By 2026, Federal debt would rise from 80 to over 105 per cent of GDP. increasing the US ratio of debt to GDP from about 77 per cent to at least 105 per cent. Once debt levels exceed 90-100 per cent of GDP, economic growth becomes seriously impaired. The major risk then is that after an initial economic boost, the US becomes mired again in rising public deficits \u2013 remember debt will be rising anyway in the 2020\u2019s because of medicare and social security spending. Since the external deficit would probably deteriorate as well, the likelihood is that economic instability, higher inflation and interest rates, a falling currency, and then an economic downturn might ensue. And if Trump is keen to push for de-regulation, including of banking and finance, that instability might be accentuated. The early rally in European stock markets is fading, as City traders look nervously over to America. The main indices have dipped, having jumped 1% early this morning. Bloomberg\u2019s healthcheck on the global financial markets is a pounding mass of red right now: Each column shows how an asset class has performed. So from left to right, you can see that Most emerging economy\u2019s equity markets have fallen today as investors dump shares. Most currencies have fallen against the US dollar today, including the yen, euro and Turkish lira There have been heavy losses across the government bond markets today, both in developed and emerging economies The cost of insuring those bonds against default, using a credit default swap, has risen (showing that investors see government debt as riskier) But the prices of iron ore, zinc and lead have risen Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers shares JP Morgan\u2019s concerns about Trump\u2019s infrastructure investment plan. Writing in the Financial Times, Summers argues that the scheme won\u2019t address the parts of America that most need improving, won\u2019t get key private sector investors involved, and risks pushing borrowing to dangerous levels: Summers argues: Unfortunately, the plan presented by his advisers, Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross, suggests an approach based on tax credits for equity investment and total private sector participation that will not cover the most important projects, not reach many of the most important investors, and involve substantial mis-targeting of public resources. Many of the highest return infrastructure investments \u2014 such as improving roads, repairing 60,000 structurally deficient bridges, upgrading schools or modernising the air traffic control system \u2014 do not generate a commercial return and so are excluded from his plan. Nor can the non-taxable pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds that are the most promising sources of capital for infrastructure take advantage of the program. I am optimistic regarding the efficacy of fiscal expansion. But any responsible economist has to recognise that, past a point, it can lead to some combination of excessive foreign borrowing, inflation and even financial crisis. Here\u2019s the full piece: A badly designed US stimulus will only hurt the working class Summers, of course, has been urging Western politicians to spend more on infrastructure projects for years, so his opposition is a slight surprise.... Donald Trump\u2019s plan to boost US economic growth by rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure is dangerous and unnecessary, claims JP Morgan\u2019s chief global strategist, David Kelly. In a new note to clients, Kelly argues that the US economy is not under-performing at present, and wouldn\u2019t be helped by a large debt-fuelled stimulus. Kelly is also concerned that Trump\u2019s proposed tax cut plans would send the national debt clock up to 100% of national output. First, the federal budget is already dangerously out of balance. Second, the economy is already at full employment so that stimulus applied now is more likely to stoke higher inflation and interest rates than greater real GDP growth. The federal deficit is already rising, growing from 2.5% of GDP in fiscal 2015 to 3.2% of GDP in fiscal 2016. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, under current law, the national debt will grow from 77% of GDP in fiscal 2016 to 86% in fiscal 2026. However, in a September analysis of President-elect Trump\u2019s fiscal plans, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that they would push the debt to 105% of GDP by 2026 if fully implemented. Most of the cost of these plans comes from large proposed tax cuts for both corporations and individuals, although increased defense spending also has a sizable impact. Kelly also points out that the recent surge in government bond yields shows that the plan would be pricy: It does not take a brilliant mathematician to see that if long-term Treasury rates return to more normal levels, financing this debt will absorb a much greater share of federal revenues over time. In the 50 years before the financial crisis, the average interest rate paid on federal debt was 5.6% but the average debt-to-GDP ratio was just 37%. A 5.6% average interest rate on a debt equal to 105% of GDP would be ruinous. The truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, Kelly arguses that the wider US economy doesn\u2019t need a stimulus boost right now: The U.S. economy is, for all intents and purposes, at full employment. The overall unemployment rate is 4.9% - lower than it has been 77% of the time over the past 50 years while the short-term unemployment rate is lower than it has been 98% of the time over the past 50 years. Trump supporters might question this rosy view of the US economy -- especially in the Rust Belt where manufacturing jobs have been lost and wage growth pegged down. But... if Kelly\u2019s right, the fiscal stimulus might not actually regenerate America\u2019s economy at all (creating short-term construction work, but not sparking a manufacturing revival). He concludes: In this economy, a shock boost to aggregate demand through tax cuts would likely boost inflation and imports more than domestic production, since the U.S. economy is supply-side constrained. Higher inflation and bigger deficits should lead to higher interest rates \u2013 particularly if the Federal Reserve perceives inflation risks as having risen and so raises short-term interest rates. The American economy is more like a healthy tortoise than a sickly hare. Immigration reform designed to increase skilled immigrants or policies that boosted productivity growth might give the economy the ability to run faster. However, in the absence of this kind of supply-side effort, boosting aggregate demand to make the tortoise run faster would mainly result in over-heating. Italian bonds are also weakening today, with long-term yields hitting their highest in 16 months. Italy could be the next country to suffer a political earthquake, if prime minister Matteo Renzi loses his constitutional reforms referendum next month. Renzi hinted this morning that he might quit if the public reject the proposal to reform the Senate. Speaking on a radio interview, Renzi declared: If I have to stay on in parliament and do what everyone else has done before me, that is, to scrape by and just float there, that does not suit me.\u201d Opinion polls suggest the referendum is close. The reforms are opposed by the right-wing ant-immigrant Northern League, and the radical eurosceptic Movement Five Star -- who both relish the prospect of inflicting defeat on Renzi (once seen as the man to lead Italy out of years of stagnation and political quicksand). Just in! The interest rate on short-dated American bonds has hit its highest level since the start of the year. Two-year US treasury bills are now yielding 1% for the first time since January, as prices are dragged down by the wider bond rout today. Most Asian stock markets have fallen today. They were hit by fears that emerging markets will suffer from a stronger US dollar (luring capital back to America) or trade protectionism. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index shed almost 1.4%, finishing the day on (an auspicious?) 22,222.22 points. Over the weekend, US blogger and portfolio manager Matt Busigin argued that the financial markets are making a serious mistake in their analysis of the looming Trump presidency. He argues that they\u2019ve focused on the likely results of Trump\u2019s promises, without also factoring in just how much instability America could experience under their new leader. In his view -- investors should be a lot more risk-averse. [that\u2019s Nominal GDP - or the real growth rate plus the inflation rate] If Busigin\u2019s right, we could see a sharp correction if a) investors get nervous, or b) Trump\u2019s administration does indeed struggle. Many analysts think the global bond rout is only just beginning. It will take a while for investors to properly adjust their portfolios - especially if they\u2019ve gorged on low-yielding government bonds because they expected many more years of low inflation. Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of European macro research at Goldman Sachs, has predicted that the yield on America\u2019s 10-year Treasury bills will keep rising: \u201cThe prospect of US fiscal stimulus under the new government has increased our conviction that the US 10-year yield will reach 2.5 per cent in 2017, possibly faster than we earlier assumed. \u201cWhether Mr Trump\u2019s presidency brings fiscal spending or protectionism, we think either scenario would boost inflation.\u201d [reminder, the 10-year yield crunched through 2.2% this morning] The US dollar has hit an 11-month high against a basket of other currencies this morning. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the greenback is going from \u201cstrength to strength\u201d, amid predictions that US interest rates will rise faster than previously expected. A Trump win had initially cast doubt on the probability of a rate increase in December, with the markets pricing in just a 50% chance of a hike on election night; however, this has since rebounded back. With unemployment historically low and Trump\u2019s heavy spending plans taking shape, inflation could well charge higher more quickly than initially forecast. Two rate rises had been pencilled in for next year, but if Trump decides to front load his spending then we could expect more rises through the year, resulting in the dollar pushing further northwards. Germany\u2019s long-term borrowing costs are also rising today, as the global bond market suffers from \u201cTrumpflation\u201d worries. It\u2019s another sign that investors are shifting money out of government bonds and into other assets. Reuters has a good take: German 30-year bond yields broke through 1% for the first time in more than six months on Monday, as investors dumped bonds on bets that the policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will push up inflation. In a broad debt market sell-off, Italian 10-year yields broke above 2% for the first time since September 2015and U.S. 30-year yields topped 3% for the first time since January. German 10-year yields -- the euro zone benchmark -- rose to their highest since January, extending their biggest weekly rise this year after Republican Trump unexpectedly defeated Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential race. \u201cIt is a continuation of this recent trend. There are still these expectations that inflation could go up if the U.S. takes a more expansionary fiscal stance,\u201d DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz said. The US dollar is strengthening this morning, hitting \u20ac1.075 against the euro. That\u2019s its highest level since January. On the one hand, the dollar is benefitting from the prospect of higher American interest rates. On the other, concerns of rising populism and political crises in Europe has been undermining the euro in recent weeks. The pound has also lost ground against the dollar, dropping one cent below $1.25 (which has helped to push the FTSE 100 index up). Its shares 1, bonds 0 this morning. European shares are all rallying in early trading, led by financial stocks and mining companies. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 82 points to 6814. House builder Taylor Wimpey is doing well, up 4% after reporting that the Brexit vote hasn\u2019t hurt trading. Barclays is up 3%. Banks should benefit if interest rates rise to calm inflation. And commodity prices are also benefitting from the prospect of a new US fiscal splurge (Trump will need a lot of copper and iron ore to rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure), so Anglo American and BHP Billiton have gained 2%. US bond prices are also falling this morning, driven by expectations that Trump\u2019s promised policies would drive up inflation. The yield on 10-year Treasury bills has jumped to 2.23%, from 2.13% on Thursday night [the market was closed on Friday for Veterans Day]. That\u2019s the highest level since January, and quite a substantial move, underlining how assets are being rapidly repriced... Government bonds are being hit hard in early trading as investors pick up where they left off last week. The prices of US and European government sovereign debt are falling sharply, following last week\u2019s selloff which wiped $1 trillion dollars off bond prices. The move is being driven by concerns that Donald Trump\u2019s plans for a debt-fuelled stimulus programme, and hefty tax cuts for richer Americans, will drive inflation up. The yield (or interest rate) on UK 10-year government debt has jumped over 1.42% this morning, up from 1.36% on Friday night. That\u2019s the highest yield since the end of May, before the Brexit vote. German bonds are also being driven down from their recent record highs. The yield on benchmark 10-year bunds hit a nine-month high this morning at 0.35% These moves mean that any investors who bought bonds before last week\u2019s selloff are facing losses. They also indicate that governments must pay a higher interest rate when they sell bonds in the market to fund their deficits (compared to a few weeks ago). Bloomberg are calling it a \u2018global bond rout\u2019, saying: A global bond rout is intensifying, sending U.S. 30-year yields above 3 percent for the first time since January, on speculation Donald Trump will increase spending to boost the world\u2019s largest economy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. November is typically a time for investors to reflect about what went right, and wrong, that year and to ponder what might be coming next. And after the US elections last week, City experts have a lot of rethinking to do. Donald Trump\u2019s victory, so soon after the Brexit vote, has shaken many of the old certainties that have underpinned investment strategies for years. Inflation is back in town, as the president-elect plots a financial stimulus programme that could sent America\u2019s national debt spiralling (even) higher and force inflation out of its rut. And free trade is looking vulnerable too, with China threatening to hit American imports unless the next leader of the free world reins himself in: All of a sudden, putting one\u2019s clients\u2019 money into government bonds at record high prices (and thus record low returns), may not feel like such a smart move. Eric Peters, the boss of One River Management, talked about the shock of waking up in \u2018Trump world\u201d in his latest note to clients: That\u2019s why we saw bond prices slide last week, as people moved swiftly to reposition themselves. We\u2019ll probably see more significant shifts in asset prices this week. Also coming up today.... Japan has smashed expectations overnight, by reporting that its economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.2% in the last quarter. That\u2019s much better than the 0.9% which economists expected. The recovery was due to a jump in exports, so could be vulnerable if the global economy deteriorates. I\u2019ll mop up some reaction shortly. And UK housebuilder Taylor Wimpey and bookmaker William Hill are both reporting financial results, so we\u2019ll watch for any interesting angles there too.",

But we still don\u2019t expect that they will rise as fast as in the US.</p> <p>Treasury yields have risen sharply in the US since the election there on 8th November. This reflects investors\u2019 expectations of a major fiscal stimulus under President Trump, which would both increase the supply of bonds and mainly boost inflation at this stage of the US business cycle. (See our Global Markets Update, \u201cNew \u2013 even more bearish \u2013 forecasts for Treasuries\u201d, published on Friday.) Although government bond yields have also risen in Europe, the increases have been significantly smaller than in the US and we expect European government bonds to continue doing better than Treasuries in the months ahead.</p> <p>For a start, there is a far lower chance of a major fiscal loosening in Europe. Granted, we expect UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond to scale back the pace of fiscal tightening over the coming years in his Autumn Statement later this month. But this is likely to fall short of an outright fiscal stimulus. And there is even less scope for a fiscal expansion in the euro-zone.</p> <p>Second, a given amount of fiscal loosening would generate less inflationary pressure in Europe compared to the US. This is because there is a greater degree of spare capacity in the economies of Europe, particularly in the euro-zone.</p> <p>Third, following the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, Trump\u2019s victory has stoked fears of more populist revolts occurring down the line in parts of Europe, including in France, in spring\u2019s presidential election. While Bunds have arguably already benefited to some degree from the uncertainty, any increase in perceived political risk should further boost safe-haven demand, thereby helping to contain yields there. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5829eeece4b0eb4ebf273f88\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T17:21:36.966Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets edge higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite Wall Street coming off its best levels after earlier hitting a new peak, European markets have managed to end the day in positive territory.

He has threatened China with heavy tariffs as a punitive measure for the now redundant charge of manipulating its currency, and opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that was central to President Obama\u2019s pivot to Asia. Even now, China is busy trying to get Asia-Pacific countries to sign up to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, its own version of America\u2019s TPP.</p> <p>If Trump proved to be a real isolationist and walked away from open trading agreements, and imposed trade barriers, he might imagine this that would protect American workers and bring jobs home.

By 2026, Federal debt would rise from 80 to over 105 per cent of GDP. increasing the US ratio of debt to GDP from about 77 per cent to at least 105 per cent. Once debt levels exceed 90-100 per cent of GDP, economic growth becomes seriously impaired.</p> <p>The major risk then is that after an initial economic boost, the US becomes mired again in rising public deficits \u2013 remember debt will be rising anyway in the 2020\u2019s because of medicare and social security spending. Since the external deficit would probably deteriorate as well, the likelihood is that economic instability, higher inflation and interest rates, a falling currency, and then an economic downturn might ensue. And if Trump is keen to push for de-regulation, including of banking and finance, that instability might be accentuated.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/georgemagnus1/status/798141658512654336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My take on Trump&#39;s economics.

Nor can the non-taxable pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds that are the most promising sources of capital for infrastructure take advantage of the program.</p> <p>I am optimistic regarding the efficacy of fiscal expansion. But any responsible economist has to recognise that, past a point, it can lead to some combination of excessive foreign borrowing, inflation and even financial crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s the full piece:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2673c232-a9b2-11e6-a0bb-97f42551dbf4\">A badly designed US stimulus will only hurt the working class</a></h2> <p>Summers, of course, has been urging Western politicians to spend more on infrastructure projects for <strong>years</strong>, so his opposition is a slight surprise....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rbrharrison/status/798123525731061761\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#39;When I said I wanted a huge fiscal stimulus I didn&#39;t mean THIS fiscal stimulus&#39; - classic case of be careful what you wish for... <a href=\"https://t.co/igJMCw4gmj\">https://t.co/igJMCw4gmj</a></p>&mdash; Rupert Harrison (@rbrharrison) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rbrharrison/status/798123525731061761\">November 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5829a682e4b0364c91946821\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T12:12:46.278Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">JP Morgan: Trump's stimulus plan would be dangerous</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump\u2019s plan to boost US economic growth by rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure is dangerous and unnecessary, claims JP Morgan\u2019s chief global strategist, David Kelly.</strong><br></p> <p>In a new note to clients, Kelly argues that the US economy is not under-performing at present, and wouldn\u2019t be helped by a large debt-fuelled stimulus.</p> <p>Kelly is also concerned that Trump\u2019s proposed tax cut plans would send the national debt clock up to 100% of national output.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, the federal budget is already dangerously out of balance. Second, the economy is already at full employment so that stimulus applied now is more likely to stoke higher inflation and interest rates than greater real GDP growth.</p> <p>The federal deficit is already rising, growing from 2.5% of GDP in fiscal 2015 to 3.2% of GDP in fiscal 2016. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, under current law, the national debt will grow from 77% of GDP in fiscal 2016 to 86% in fiscal 2026. </p> <p>However, in a September analysis of President-elect Trump\u2019s fiscal plans, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that they would push the debt to 105% of GDP by 2026 if fully implemented. Most of the cost of these plans comes from large proposed tax cuts for both corporations and individuals, although increased defense spending also has a sizable impact.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kelly also points out that the recent surge in government bond yields shows that the plan would be pricy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It does not take a brilliant mathematician to see that if long-term Treasury rates return to more normal levels, financing this debt will absorb a much greater share of federal revenues over time. In the 50 years before the financial crisis, the average interest rate paid on federal debt was 5.6% but the average debt-to-GDP ratio was just 37%. A 5.6% average interest rate on a debt equal to 105% of GDP would be ruinous. </p> <p>The truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if that wasn\u2019t enough, Kelly arguses that the wider US economy doesn\u2019t need a stimulus boost right now:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The U.S. economy is, for all intents and purposes, at full employment. The overall unemployment rate is 4.9% - lower than it has been 77% of the time over the past 50 years while the short-term unemployment rate is lower than it has been 98% of the time over the past 50 years.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Trump supporters might question this rosy view of the US economy -- especially in the Rust Belt where manufacturing jobs have been lost and wage growth pegged down. </strong></p> <p>But... if Kelly\u2019s right, the fiscal stimulus might not actually regenerate America\u2019s economy at all (creating short-term construction work, but not sparking a manufacturing revival).</p> <p>He concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this economy, a shock boost to aggregate demand through tax cuts would likely boost inflation and imports more than domestic production, since the U.S. economy is supply-side constrained. Higher inflation and bigger deficits should lead to higher interest rates \u2013 particularly if the Federal Reserve perceives inflation risks as having risen and so raises short-term interest rates.</p> <p>The American economy is more like a healthy tortoise than a sickly hare. Immigration reform designed to <em>increase</em> skilled immigrants or policies that boosted productivity growth might give the economy the ability to run faster. However, in the absence of this kind of supply-side effort, boosting aggregate demand to make the tortoise run faster would mainly result in over-heating.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8f015883600ba84c348975d553a6ae3a2b364c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8f015883600ba84c348975d553a6ae3a2b364c0/0_236_4809_2886/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On your marks!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hare-raising fiscal outlook means Trump should perhaps resist shelling out on new highways.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gk Hart/vikki Hart/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T13:20:51.341Z\">at 1.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58299cf6e4b0364c919467eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T11:33:47.991Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Italian bonds are also weakening today, with long-term yields hitting their highest in 16 months.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/798122001307209728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ITALIAN 30-YEAR BOND YIELDS HIT HIGHEST SINCE JULY 2015, UP AROUND 20 BASIS POINTS ON DAY AT 3.34 PERCENT</p>&mdash; *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaOne) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/798122001307209728\">November 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Italy could be the next country to suffer a political earthquake, if prime minister Matteo Renzi loses his constitutional reforms referendum next month.</p> <p>Renzi hinted this morning that he might <strong>quit</strong> if the public reject <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/could-italys-renzi-be-next-victim-of-an-unwanted-referendum\">the proposal to reform the Senate</a>.</p> <p>Speaking on a radio interview, Renzi declared:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If I have to stay on in parliament and do what everyone else has done before me, that is, to scrape by and just float there, that does not suit me.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Opinion polls suggest the referendum is close.</p> <p>The reforms are opposed by the right-wing ant-immigrant Northern League, and the radical eurosceptic Movement Five Star -- who both relish the prospect of inflicting defeat on Renzi (once seen as the man to lead Italy out of years of stagnation and political quicksand).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/andreavogt/status/798092480231129088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Renzi?src=hash\">#Renzi</a> survive amidst the right &amp;  left&#39;s referendum pincer movement? 6 mos ago u didn&#39;t see graffitti like this in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bologna?src=hash\">#Bologna</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/blpOYOAHdZ\">pic.twitter.com/blpOYOAHdZ</a></p>&mdash; Andrea Vogt (@andreavogt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andreavogt/status/798092480231129088\">November 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58299955e4b0eb4ebf273d99\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-14T11:13:30.804Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just in!

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Executive pay is too high and risks damaging the reputation of big business, according to an influential fund management group which has drawn up ideas for reform that could reduce the overall remuneration package of top bosses. Hermes Investment Management published a paper showing that the average pay of a chief executive could be cut from \u00a35m to \u00a33m if bonuses were eradicated, or to \u00a34.5m if some of the complexity in current pay schemes was stripped away. \u201cThe phenomenon of rapidly rising rewards for top talent, while not limited to corporate executive pay, is beginning to threaten the public company\u2019s licence to operate and thus potential long-term value,\u201d Hermes said in its report. Hermes \u2013 owned by the BT pension scheme \u2013 has been working on the paper for a number of weeks at a time when the behaviour of big business has shot up the agenda in light of remarks made by Theresa May during her campaign to become Conservative party leader and prime minister. May hit out against the gap between directors\u2019 pay and the wider workforce, while raising the idea of putting workers on boards. Her ideas are yet to be published formally by the government but the MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee will on Tuesday begin taking evidence on ways to reform corporate governance. Outlining ideas for senior executives to hold shares worth five times their salaries \u2013 more than double the current norm \u2013 Hermes said: \u201cWe believe it is necessary to challenge the level of overall pay paid to some executives.\u201d \u201cPublic companies, as their name suggests, ultimately need a social licence to operate. Given the responsibility that the chief executive role entails it is appropriate that the individual should be paid commensurately. It is also the case, however, that the role ... is a privileged one and an incumbent is often the recipient of many highly valued non-monetary benefits,\u201d Hermes said. A number of fund managers have set out ideas to change executive pay after a year of protests at annual general meetings of major companies. The season began in April with two FTSE 100 companies \u2013 BP and Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 having their pay deals voted down. Legal &amp; General Investment Management, the fund management arm of the insurer, has told firms there should be a cap on directors\u2019 bonuses, so that they are not bigger than twice the salary. The current system of pay typically involves directors receiving an annual salary, an annual bonus and a long-term incentive scheme (Ltip) running for three or five years based on shares. Hermes said reducing this complexity could cut pay, while the more radical option of scrapping bonuses altogether \u2013 and making awards of shares to directors \u2013 could reduce overall pay. \u201cWe strongly believe the time is right for companies and investors to fundamentally rethink their approach to executive remuneration,\u201d Hermes said. The chairman of the remuneration committee should write to employees each year to explain the chief executive\u2019s pay relative to the organisation, Hermes said. Hermes appears to step back from endorsing ideas of putting workers on boards but said that the chair of the remuneration committee should meet employees. The fund manager also also calls for companies to publish \u2013 and provide comment on \u2013 the ratio of chief executive pay to that of the median worker. The gap between the boardroom and the wider workforce has been highlighted in a series of reports. Last year, the High Pay Centre called for companies to spell out the disparity after publishing data showing the ratio chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 to their average employee was 150:1 in 2014. A report by City grandees \u2013 who met under the auspices of the lobby group the Investment Association \u2013 in July also raised ideas about publishing pay ratios. In the US, companies will be forced to publish their pay ratios from 2017.",

It is also the case, however, that the role ... is a privileged one and an incumbent is often the recipient of many highly valued non-monetary benefits,\u201d Hermes said.</p> <p>A number of fund managers have set out ideas to change executive pay after a year of protests at annual general meetings of major companies. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal\">season began in April with two FTSE 100 companies</a> \u2013 BP and Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 having their pay deals voted down. Legal &amp; General Investment Management, the fund management arm of the insurer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/legal-general-warns-firms-over-bonuses-executive-pay\">has told firms there should be a cap on directors\u2019 bonuses</a>, so that they are not bigger than twice the salary.<br></p> <p>The current system of pay typically involves directors receiving an annual salary, an annual bonus and a long-term incentive scheme (Ltip) running for three or five years based on shares. Hermes said reducing this complexity could cut pay, while the more radical option of scrapping bonuses altogether \u2013 and making awards of shares to directors \u2013 could reduce overall pay.</p> <p>\u201cWe strongly believe the time is right for companies and investors to fundamentally rethink their approach to executive remuneration,\u201d Hermes said.</p> <p>The chairman of the remuneration committee should write to employees each year to explain the chief executive\u2019s pay relative to the organisation, Hermes said.</p> <p>Hermes appears to step back from endorsing ideas of putting workers on boards but said that the chair of the remuneration committee should meet employees. The fund manager also also calls for companies to publish \u2013 and provide comment on \u2013 the ratio of chief executive pay to that of the median worker.</p> <p>The gap between the boardroom and the wider workforce has been highlighted in a series of reports. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/24/big-businesses-urged-reveal-pay-gap-between-bosses-workers\">Last year, the High Pay Centre called for companies to spell out the disparity</a> after publishing data showing the ratio chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 to their average employee was 150:1 in 2014. </p> <p>A report by City grandees \u2013 who met under the auspices of the lobby group <a href=\"http://www.theinvestmentassociation.org/\">the Investment Association</a> \u2013 in July <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/pay-ratios-could-be-made-public-as-part-of-executive-salary-reform\">also raised ideas about publishing </a>pay ratios.</p> <p>In the US, companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/05/companies-disclosure-ceo-workforce-pay-gap\">will be forced to publish their pay ratios from 2017</a>.</p>",

The monitor \u2013 who is overseeing the bank\u2019s attempts to overhaul its systems after a \u00a31.2bn fine for money laundering offences from the US in 2012 \u2013 is reported to have been concerned about the number of staff willing to move from London to Birmingham, which the bank has selected as the headquarters of its main UK operations. However, the monitor, Michael Cherkasky, is reported to have been convinced by the bank to eventually change his assessment of the operation as \u201cin crisis\u201d. HSBC refused to comment on the monitor\u2019s work while Cherkasky would not comment either. But the bank responded to the report in the Times (\u00a3) by insisting that the aim to move 1,000 staff to a new head office in Birmingham was not behind schedule. The Birmingham move has been prompted by rules requiring UK banks to ringfence their high street operations from their investment banking arms, as outlined by Sir John Vickers in his report on banking in 2011. Dame Clara Furse, the former chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, is to become chair of the operation. Other banks are also racing to comply with the rules which comes into force at the start of 2019. Nigel Hinshelwood, head of HSBC\u2019s UK bank, said: \u201cWe always knew that moving more than 1,000 roles from London to Birmingham was going to be a major undertaking. We also understood that not everyone would want to or be able to move due to personal commitments. That\u2019s why we have phased this over three and a half years. We\u2019re ahead of where we planned to be by this point in the project and by the end of this year, more than a quarter of the roles will already be based in Birmingham.\u201d By the end of the year, the remaining 700 or so London-based staff will have to inform the bank whether they intend to move. Those who decide not to do so could face redundancy. Last year only 13% of those staff earmarked for relocation had indicated they were ready to take on the move, although that figure is said to be increasing. A report by estate agents Knight Frank published last week said Birmingham was enjoying a renaissance, fuelled by manufacturers and the arrival of big banks and professional services firms, as well as the planned HS2 rail link. The monitor makes an annual report to regulators in the UK and US, and HSBC admitted in February \u2013 when it published its results for 2015 \u2013 that \u201csignificant concerns\u201d had been raised about the slow pace of change to its procedures to combat crime.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Parliament launches a series of hearings on reforming British boardrooms on Tuesday, as MPs pledge to ensure Theresa May fulfils her promise to clean up big business. The business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee is collecting evidence for its own investigation into corporate governance, while the government\u2019s own consultation is expected to start before Christmas. In her brief campaign to become Conservative party leader, May hit out against the gap between directors\u2019 pay and the wider workforce, while raising the idea of putting workers on boards. Iain Wright, chair of the BEIS committee, said: \u201cI hope she\u2019s not rolling back.\u201d The submissions to the committee\u2019s corporate governance probe offer ideas to tackle executive pay \u2013 the average boss earned \u00a35.5m in 2015, up from just under \u00a35m the year before \u2013 and provide clues to the other topics that will be debated in the months ahead. Scrap the current rules Pay directors in cash and scrap all the complicated bonuses paid in shares is the radical idea put forward in one submission by the Institute of Business Ethics (IBE), a charity set up 30 years ago. It calls for cash to be the main basis for pay. Directors should use some of their cash to buy shares which they must hold onto after they leave. Receiving dividends on their shares will make them focus on the long-term health of the company. Cap pay Fund managers traditionally shy away from setting out how much directors should be paid but there are signs that some are ready to intervene. Hermes has suggested a limit could be achieved by requiring companies to set out the maximum the chief executive could receive each year. The UK Shareholders\u2019 Association, which represents private investors, suggested any bonuses should be limited to 50% of salary. The TUC also suggests bonuses should be 10% of the total pay package. Pay ratios Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), a big City investor, has backed publishing the ratio between the chief executive\u2019s pay and that of the median employee but does not set an ideal gap. The High Pay Centre is setting up a \u201c40 times\u201d club, referring to a specific ratio of executive pay to the wider workforce. Trade union Unite wants a 10:1 maximum pay ratio and also calls for a ratio to be published for the lowest paid employee. Workers on boards Arguments against this proposal include creating a two-tier board where sensitive matters are discussed by a core group and introducing a special interest on to the board. LGIM favoured making a director a so-called employee advocate. The British Bankers\u2019 Association was most dismissive, arguing for surveys and employee forums. Helena Morrissey, chair of Newton fund managers, said she had met workers who could be \u201cfantastic\u201d board members. She liked the idea of a worker on boards\u2019 pay committees. John Lewis went further, as one would expect for an employee-owned company, and advocated worker ownership of businesses. Binding pay vote Shareholders get two votes on pay: one on the current year\u2019s pay amount which is advisory and one on a three-year pay policy which is binding, which means the company has to revise the policy if it loses the vote. May has advocated another binding vote which the UK Shareholders\u2019 Association said was needed for the system to work. Morrissey was also in favour. The CBI argued shareholders would be less willing to oppose a pay deal if the vote was binding and that such votes should only apply to repeat offenders. The IBE was most radical, calling for no payment under schemes that cannot be understood when the payment is awarded. Diversity A read through the submissions to the committee so far shows that breaking free from white, middle-aged male groupthink is almost universally popular. The Institute of Directors criticises companies for rejecting alternative voices at the risk of stagnation and calls for younger directors. LGIM opposes quotas but wants the chairman to push for a greater mix of ethnicity, skills and background. The TUC calls for mandatory quotas for women. The Campaign for Merit in Business has a different view, asserting the diversity drive is \u201canti-male\u201d and asking why the government does not encourage more women in sewage work and bomb disposal. BHS question The IoD argued no new rules are needed in the wake of the BHS scandal and that imposing burdens on small companies would be bad for the economy. But the IBE said private companies should state their commitment to the law requiring directors to look out for employees, suppliers, customers and wider society. Fill pension deficits The collapse of BHS also exposed concerns about how companies deal with pension deficits. The IBE suggested that when a company has a shortfall in its pension scheme, any bonuses and salary increases to directors should be blocked unless there is an agreement in place with the Pensions Regulator on how the deficit will be closed. Succession planning Sorting out the next boss well in advance could be one way to keep pay under control. \u201cAn executive director can claim they have received a better offer elsewhere, and boards might feel vulnerable when they know that several companies in their sector are looking for a finance director or a CEO,\u201d LGIM said.",

      "body": "<p>Parliament launches a series of hearings on reforming British boardrooms on Tuesday, as MPs pledge to ensure Theresa May fulfils her promise to clean up big business. </p> <p>The business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee is collecting evidence for its own investigation into corporate governance, while the government\u2019s own consultation is expected to start before Christmas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/11/andrea-leadsom-apologises-to-theresa-may-politics-live\"> In her brief campaign to become Conservative party leader, May hit</a> out against the gap between directors\u2019 pay and the wider workforce, while raising the idea of putting workers on boards.<br></p> <p>Iain Wright, chair of the BEIS committee, said: \u201cI hope she\u2019s not rolling back.\u201d</p> <p>The submissions to the committee\u2019s corporate governance probe offer ideas to tackle executive pay \u2013 the average boss earned \u00a35.5m in 2015, up from just under \u00a35m the year before \u2013 and provide clues to the other topics that will be debated in the months ahead.</p> <h2><strong>Scrap the current rules</strong></h2> <p>Pay directors in cash and scrap all the complicated bonuses paid in shares is the radical idea<a href=\"http://www.ibe.org.uk/userassets/otherpdfs/ibe_beis_parl_comm_corpgov.pdf\"> put forward in one submission by the Institute of Business Ethics</a> (IBE), a charity set up 30 years ago. It calls for cash to be the main basis for pay. Directors should use some of their cash to buy shares which they must hold onto after they leave. Receiving dividends on their shares will make them focus on the long-term health of the company. </p> <h2>Cap pay</h2> <p>Fund managers traditionally shy away from setting out how much directors should be paid but there are signs that some are ready to intervene. Hermes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/14/scrap-bonuses-fund-manager-reforming-executive-pay-hermes-investment-management\">has suggested a limit could be achieved</a> by requiring companies to set out the maximum the chief executive could receive each year. The UK Shareholders\u2019 Association, which represents private investors,<a href=\"http://www.uksa.org.uk/sites/default/files/BIS_Committee_Oct2016UKSA_submission.pdf\"> suggested any bonuses should be limited to 50% of salary.</a> The TUC also suggests bonuses should be 10% of the total pay package. </p> <h2>Pay ratios</h2> <p>Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), a big City investor, has backed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/16/legal-general-warns-firms-over-bonuses-executive-pay\">publishing the ratio between the chief executive\u2019s pay and that of the median employe</a>e but does not set an ideal gap. The High Pay Centre is setting up a \u201c40 times\u201d club, referring to a specific ratio of executive pay to the wider workforce. Trade union Unite wants a 10:1 maximum pay ratio and also calls for a ratio to be published for the lowest paid employee. </p> <h2>Workers on boards</h2> <p>Arguments against this proposal include creating a two-tier board where sensitive matters are discussed by a core group and introducing a special interest on to the board. LGIM favoured making a director a so-called employee advocate. The British Bankers\u2019 Association was most dismissive, arguing for surveys and employee forums. Helena Morrissey, chair of Newton fund managers, said she had met workers who could be \u201cfantastic\u201d board members. She liked the idea of a worker on boards\u2019 pay committees. John Lewis went further, as one would expect for an employee-owned company, and advocated worker ownership of businesses.<br></p> <h2>Binding pay vote</h2> <p>Shareholders get two votes on pay: one on the current year\u2019s pay amount which is advisory and one on a three-year pay policy which is binding, which means the company has to revise the policy if it loses the vote. May has advocated another binding vote which the UK Shareholders\u2019 Association said was needed for the system to work. Morrissey <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/business-energy-and-industrial-strategy-committee/corporate-governance/written/41651.html\">was also in favour</a>. The CBI argued shareholders would be less willing to oppose a pay deal if the vote was binding and that such votes should only apply to repeat offenders. The IBE was most radical, calling for no payment under schemes that cannot be understood when the payment is awarded.</p> <h2>Diversity</h2> <p>A read through the submissions to the committee so far shows that breaking free from white, middle-aged male groupthink is almost universally popular. The Institute of Directors criticises companies for rejecting alternative voices at the risk of stagnation and calls for younger directors. LGIM opposes quotas but wants the chairman to push for a greater mix of ethnicity, skills and background. The TUC calls for mandatory quotas for women. The <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/business-energy-and-industrial-strategy-committee/corporate-governance/written/41577.html\">Campaign for Merit in Business has a different view</a>, asserting the diversity drive is \u201canti-male\u201d and asking why the government does not encourage more women in sewage work and bomb disposal.</p> <h2>BHS question</h2> <p>The IoD argued no new rules are needed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report\">the wake of the BHS scandal</a> and that imposing burdens on small companies would be bad for the economy. But the IBE said private companies should state their commitment to the law requiring directors to look out for employees, suppliers, customers and wider society. <br></p> <h2>Fill pension deficits<br></h2> <p>The collapse of BHS also exposed concerns about how companies deal with pension deficits. The IBE suggested that when a company has a shortfall in its pension scheme, any bonuses and salary increases to directors should be blocked unless there is an agreement in place with the Pensions Regulator on how the deficit will be closed. </p> <h2>Succession planning </h2> <p>Sorting out the next boss well in advance could be one way to keep pay under control. \u201cAn executive director can claim they have received a better offer elsewhere, and boards might feel vulnerable when they know that several companies in their sector are looking for a finance director or a CEO,\u201d LGIM said. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and other extreme natural disasters push 26 million people into poverty each year and cost the global economy more than half a trillion dollars in lost consumption, the World Bank has said. A bank study of 117 countries concluded that the full cost of natural disasters was $520bn (\u00a3416bn) a year \u2013 60% higher than any previous estimate \u2013 once the impact on poor people was taken into account. The World Bank published its findings at the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech and said the report underlined the need to protect the most vulnerable against the effects of global warming. Jim Kim, the World Bank\u2019s president, said: \u201cSevere climate shocks threaten to roll back decades of progress against poverty. Storms, floods, and droughts have dire human and economic consequences, with poor people often paying the heaviest price. Building resilience to disasters not only makes economic sense, it is a moral imperative.\u201d The report cited evidence from the impact of Tropical Storm Agatha in 2010, which led to consumption per head falling by 5.5% and increased poverty by 14%. Policies that made countries more resilient to extreme natural disasters and improved early warning systems could bring benefits of $100bn a year, the bank said. It cited the examples of Kenya, where the country\u2019s social protection system had provided help to vulnerable farmers well before the 2015 drought, and Pakistan, where a rapid response programme of cash grants after severe floods in 2010 had benefited 8 million people. Stephane Hallegatte, who prepared the World Bank report, said: \u201cCountries are enduring a growing number of unexpected shocks as a result of climate change. Poor people need social and financial protection from disasters that cannot be avoided. With risk policies that we know to be effective, we have the opportunity to prevent millions of people from falling into poverty.\u201d The bank\u2019s research showed that previous studies had underestimated the impact of natural disasters because they had measured the cost by assessing damage to physical assets. Costs were much higher when lost consumption of poor people who have fewer assets than the better off was taken into account. It said $1 in losses did not mean the same to a rich person and poor person. \u201cThe same loss affects poor and marginalised people far more because their livelihoods depend on fewer assets, their consumption is closer to subsistence levels, they cannot rely on savings to smooth the impacts, their health and education are at greater risk, and they may need more time to recover and reconstruct. \u201cA flood or an earthquake can be disastrous for poor people, but have a negligible impact on a country\u2019s wealth or production if it affects people who own almost nothing and have very low incomes.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Politicians around the world risk giving more traction to nationalistic movements if they continue to ignore the growing numbers of workers getting a \u201craw deal\u201d from globalisation, the head of the UN\u2019s labour agency has warned. The director general of the International Labour Organization (ILO), Guy Ryder, described Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election and the UK\u2019s vote for Brexit as \u201cthe revolt of the dispossessed\u201d and gave a damning assessment of the establishment\u2019s failure to offer an alternative to protectionism. British-born Ryder said governments had been too quick to focus on headline figures that flattered the state of labour markets since the global financial crisis. In so doing they had failed to scratch below the surface into a world of zero-hours contracts, underemployment and unreliable incomes, he said, as the ILO released research showing a rise in such non-standard forms of employment. \u201cThe societies we all live in are distributing the benefits of globalisation and economic processes extraordinarily unfairly and people think they are getting a raw deal,\u201d Ryder told the Guardian. Speaking days after Trump stunned the world with his victory over Hillary Clinton, the ILO chief highlighted the common ground between the Republican candidate\u2019s supporters and those who voted for the UK to leave the EU. \u201cIt is the people who feel they haven\u2019t benefited from globalisation and from the EU, from the way things are organised. This is the revolt of the dispossessed in that regard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the point here is that feeling, that frustration, that disillusionment, I think is very much generated from people\u2019s experience of work. Their exclusion from work, or their insertion in labour markets in conditions, which they find unacceptable.\u201d The ILO\u2019s mandate centres on ensuring what it calls \u201cdecent work\u201d. But based on its own findings, the UN agency is facing an uphill battle. Casual forms of work more common in the developing world are being replicated in advanced economies \u2013 the \u201cgig economy\u201d \u2013 as on-demand services such as Uber and Deliveroo grow. The ILO report published on Monday finds temporary work, agency work, precarious self-employment and other non-standard forms of employment have become more widespread. On the ground, that translates into downward pressure on earnings, unreliable working hours and lower access to workplace benefits. It comes back to the \u201craw deal\u201d that Ryder talks about. \u201cIf you count somebody on a zero-hours contract as being in work that helps the headline figures. If you look at their life you know that it is not the type of quality, decent work that I think we are all pursuing,\u201d says Ryder, who has headed the ILO since 2012, having started his career at the TUC in Britain. \u201cPeople want to know how it can be different and the fact of the matter is, it can be different but it requires us to put the world of work and these tough labour market issues back on the table from which I think they have been unwisely removed by policymakers in recent years.\u201d His comments reflect the tendency among ministers to focus on record employment levels and falling unemployment, while largely ignoring that wages have stagnated, people have felt pressured into self-employment and millions say they want to work more hours than they can get. Ryder believes the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU should be a wake-up call. \u201cIf you take Brexit vote as a faithful reflection of the mood of people, it is not an expression of contentment and satisfaction with a full employment, \u2018I\u2019m doing well, I\u2019m getting ahead\u2019, workforce. The message is: \u2018We are living this and it doesn\u2019t feel very nice,\u2019\u201d he says. Again, there are parallels with the US where ILO researchers found 10% of the workforce had irregular and on-call work schedules, with the lowest-income workers the hardest hit. The agency wants old systems brought up to date to reflect today\u2019s world of work. Its recommendations for improving the quality of non-standard employment include plugging regulatory gaps to ensure workers are treated equally whatever type of contract they have. The ILO also wants to see minimum guaranteed hours, better social protection and stronger collective bargaining. That includes expanding unions to represent the growing number of workers in non-standard forms of employment. Ryder also stresses the need for more equal treatment of migrant workers. \u201cIf you take seriously the enforcement of minimum conditions, if you take seriously the notion of equal treatment ... you disarm and detoxify the labour market worries about undercutting local workers and at the same time you do the right thing by migrant workers.\u201d The ILO director concedes his agency is asking for a lot. But failure to act will leave voters looking to the \u201cwrong place\u201d for solutions, he says. That warning echoes growing concerns that the nationalist sentiment that boosted Trump will also come to the fore at upcoming votes in Italy, France, the Netherlands and Germany. \u201cIn generic terms, I think people think they have a binary choice in life at the moment,\u201d says Ryder. The options were \u201cmore of the same\u201d with an acceptance that inequality would rise further or \u201cdefensive, protectionist, nationalistic\u201d movements rejecting the status quo. \u201cWe have to construct something which is different from both of those two poles and to demonstrate, or to convince people, that there are different ways. That we can manage our labour markets,\u201d he says. \u201cBut middle ground between the two binary options requires the hard work of doing some fairly hard engineering of labour markets.\u201d Furthermore, the establishment must work hard to regain people\u2019s trust, he adds. \u201cPeople are not necessarily looking to the established institutions or political parties or international organisations, of which I include the ILO, in the belief that we have credible responses. So we have to up our game in that regard.\u201d Ryder has just been given the backing of his agency to do just that. Last week the director general was re-elected for a second term with support from all three branches of the tripartite agency: workers\u2019 representatives, employers and governments. Alongside curbing the rise in insecure jobs and the ILO\u2019s work on tackling child labour and forced labour, Ryder is also pushing the agency to anticipate future trends. He believes the big drivers of change are technology, globalisation, demographics and the need to align jobs and job creation with fighting climate change. All are being explored under a \u201cfuture of work\u201d programme marking the ILO\u2019s centenary in 2019. So for an agency that has been through the second world war, the cold war, the fall of communism and the rise of globalisation, the focus now shifts to robots, global warming and the gig economy. But the motivation remains the same and as the world digests the latest political shock, it is perhaps unsurprising that Ryder highlights the ILO\u2019s roots. \u201cOur historic mandate, and it came after the first world war, is based on the notion that if you want to preserve peace and stability in the world, you have to promote social justice and that has to begin in the world of work.\u201d",

This is the revolt of the dispossessed in that regard,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the point here is that feeling, that frustration, that disillusionment, I think is very much generated from people\u2019s experience of work. Their exclusion from work, or their insertion in labour markets in conditions, which they find unacceptable.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/14/neoliberalsim-donald-trump-george-monbiot\">Neoliberalism: the deep story that lies beneath Donald Trump\u2019s triumph | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ILO\u2019s mandate centres on ensuring what it calls \u201cdecent work\u201d. But based on its own findings, the UN agency is facing an uphill battle.

If you look at their life you know that it is not the type of quality, decent work that I think we are all pursuing,\u201d says Ryder, who has headed the ILO since 2012, having started his career at the TUC in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cPeople want to know how it can be different and the fact of the matter is, it can be different but it requires us to put the world of work and these tough labour market issues back on the table from which I think they have been unwisely removed by policymakers in recent years.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/employment-stays-at-record-high-with-318-million-people-in-work\">His comments reflect the tendency among ministers to focus on record employment levels</a> and falling unemployment, while largely ignoring that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jul/27/uk-joins-greece-at-bottom-of-wage-growth-league-tuc-oecd\">wages have stagnated</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/18/self-employed-earn-less-than-2001-hit-welfare-cuts\">people have felt pressured into self-employment</a> and millions say they <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/underemploymentandoveremploymentemp16\">want to work more hours than they can get</a>. </p> <p>Ryder believes the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU should be a wake-up call. </p> <p>\u201cIf you take Brexit vote as a faithful reflection of the mood of people, it is not an expression of contentment and satisfaction with a full employment, \u2018I\u2019m doing well, I\u2019m getting ahead\u2019, workforce. The message is: \u2018We are living this and it doesn\u2019t feel very nice,\u2019\u201d he says.</p> <p>Again, there are parallels with the US where ILO researchers found 10% of the workforce had irregular and on-call work schedules, with the lowest-income workers the hardest hit.</p> <p>The agency wants old systems brought up to date to reflect today\u2019s world of work.</p> <p>Its recommendations for improving the quality of non-standard employment include plugging regulatory gaps to ensure workers are treated equally whatever type of contract they have. The ILO also wants to see minimum guaranteed hours, better social protection and stronger collective bargaining. That includes expanding unions to represent the growing number of workers in non-standard forms of employment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/nov/13/donald-trump-product-of-new-economic-depression\">We are living in a depression - that's why Trump took the White House</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ryder also stresses the need for more equal treatment of migrant workers. \u201cIf you take seriously the enforcement of minimum conditions, if you take seriously the notion of equal treatment ... you disarm and detoxify the labour market worries about undercutting local workers and at the same time you do the right thing by migrant workers.\u201d</p> <p>The ILO director concedes his agency is asking for a lot. But failure to act will leave voters looking to the \u201cwrong place\u201d for solutions, he says. That warning echoes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/12/elections-eu-donald-trump-brexit-italy-referendum\">growing concerns that the nationalist sentiment that boosted Trump will also come to the fore at upcoming votes</a> in Italy, France, the Netherlands and Germany.</p> <p>\u201cIn generic terms, I think people think they have a binary choice in life at the moment,\u201d says Ryder. The options were \u201cmore of the same\u201d with an acceptance that inequality would rise further or \u201cdefensive, protectionist, nationalistic\u201d movements rejecting the status quo. </p> <p>\u201cWe have to construct something which is different from both of those two poles and to demonstrate, or to convince people, that there are different ways. That we can manage our labour markets,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cBut middle ground between the two binary options requires the hard work of doing some fairly hard engineering of labour markets.\u201d</p> <p>Furthermore, the establishment must work hard to regain people\u2019s trust, he adds. \u201cPeople are not necessarily looking to the established institutions or political parties or international organisations, of which I include the ILO, in the belief that we have credible responses. So we have to up our game in that regard.\u201d</p> <p>Ryder has just been given the backing of his agency to do just that. Last week the director general was re-elected for a second term with support from all three branches of the tripartite agency: workers\u2019 representatives, employers and governments. </p> <p>Alongside curbing the rise in insecure jobs and the ILO\u2019s work on tackling child labour and forced labour, Ryder is also pushing the agency to anticipate future trends.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/14/trump-us-economy-sick-businesses-like-his-value-creation\">He\u2019s right, the economy is sick \u2013 and businesses like Trump\u2019s are part of the disease | Mariana Mazzucato</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He believes the big drivers of change are technology, globalisation, demographics and the need to align jobs and job creation with fighting climate change. All are being explored under a \u201cfuture of work\u201d programme marking the ILO\u2019s centenary in 2019. </p> <p>So for an agency that has been through the second world war, the cold war, the fall of communism and the rise of globalisation, the focus now shifts to robots, global warming and the gig economy. But the motivation remains the same and as the world digests the latest political shock, it is perhaps unsurprising that Ryder highlights the ILO\u2019s roots. </p> <p>\u201cOur historic mandate, and it came after the first world war, is based on the notion that if you want to preserve peace and stability in the world, you have to promote social justice and that has to begin in the world of work.\u201d</p>",

Mike van Dulken and Henry Croft at Accendo Markets said: A positive start to the week comes from further easing of concerns about a Trump presidency. Certain appointments (chief of staff, chief strategist) have proved more conventional than feared, while certain populist issues aren\u2019t being focused on so much. Expectations of an infrastructure spending spree, fiscal stimulus and deregulation are, however, intensifying the bond market sell-off via hopes of growth, inflation and, more importantly, interest rate rises. Markets are also following the lead of Japan, where the Nikkei added 1.7% following news of a forecast-beating 2.2% rise in the country\u2019s GDP. Marks and Spencer has added 12.3p to 339.5p after Citigroup issued a buy note, but more defensive stocks such as utilities were out of favour, with National Grid down 18.5p at 937.2p and Severn Trent slipping 38p to \u00a321.39. Elsewhere there was some takeover news, with Irish food business Greencore climbing 12% to 327.3p as said it would pay $747.5m for US convenience food business Peacock Foods, a specialist in sandwiches and children\u2019s chilled meals. Peel Hunt said: This acquisition transforms the shape of the group, resolves the issues in the US and brings a significant new growth opportunity. The terms of the deal look sensible. At first sight, this looks like a deal that should be well received. We like what we see so far and have upgraded our recommendation from add to buy. Meanwhile William Hill has added 1.7p at 285.3p after slightly better than expected growth of 6% in third quarter revenues. It kept its full year guidance unchanged, with full year earnings forecast to be at the upper end of a \u00a3260m to \u00a3280m range, but identified \u00a330m of cost savings. The company had been struggling with its online business, and plans to use \u00a315m of the cost savings to drive faster online growth. William Hill was also the centre of failed merger attempts, and analysts believe further consolidation attempts are likely. Liberum said: The shares are trading around 10% below our target price of 323p but there is upside towards 400p (on the back of cost savings) if M&amp;A materialises. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said: Shares in William Hill are up this morning as it seems the bookmaker is turning things around at last and it looks like a very desirable merger target again \u2013 if the right suitor emerges. At 290p a share the stock is trading around 10% lower from its August highs, when takeover talks were pushing up the price. So far we\u2019ve had a couple of false starts, with the unsolicited bid from Rank and a proposed merger with Amaya both ending in failure. With the industry going through a phase of consolidation amid tightening regulation, higher taxes and greater competition online, William Hill will still have its eyes open for a strategic deal, but it can afford to wait a little longer for the right partner. On the figures, Numis analyst Richard Stuber said: William Hill\u2019s trading was reassuring in a context of recent disappointments. No division reported a decline in net revenue growth. Reassuringly, management has reiterated full year operating profit guidance at the top end of \u00a3260-280m range, 3% above consensus at the top end. Meanwhile the company has shaken its board up by appointing three new non-executive directors, in the wake of its strategic struggles.",

      "bodyText": "The US is expected to lead global growth higher over the next two years despite the growing threat posed by protectionist policies, Moody\u2019s Investors Service has warned. The rating agency predicted the US would be the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial countries in 2017 and 2018, with short-term growth boosted by Donald Trump\u2019s plans to cuts taxes and spend more on American infrastructure. US growth is expected to rise from 1.6% this year to 2.2% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018. \u201cWhile prolonged policy uncertainty could weigh on already weak investment growth, there could be an upside to growth from increased fiscal expenditure, especially infrastructure spending, and tax cuts,\u201d said Elena Duggar, associate managing director at Moody\u2019s. \u201cA protectionist stance [from Trump] on trade and immigration would be detrimental in the medium term.\u201d Globally, 2016 is expected to be the slowest year for growth since the financial crisis, at 2.6%, before picking up to 2.9% in 2017 and 2018. Duggar said that threats to the outlook for the world economy included mounting anti-globalisation sentiment and fragility in the EU, with elections due in France, Germany and the Netherlands, and the Italian referendum on constitutional reform later this year. \u201cWith the unanticipated outcomes of the Brexit vote in the UK and the US presidential election, it has become evident that nationalistic and anti-globalisation sentiments are gaining traction globally. Going forward, there is likely to be an increased tendency toward protectionist economic policies in advanced economies. \u201cThe risk of rising political discord and an increase in EU fragmentation has increased,\u201d she added. Britain\u2019s growth prospects will be hindered by lingering uncertainty about a future outside the EU, Moody\u2019s said, lowering its forecasts for 2017 and 2018. While the UK is expected to be the fastest growing of the G7 economies in 2016, growth is expected to slow sharply to 1% in 2017 and 2018. \u201cUncertainty around the future of the economy outside the common market will dampen business investment spending and potentially consumption, particularly, if businesses hold back on hiring,\u201d Duggar said. \u201cOn the other hand, monetary policy accommodation will support the economy, limiting the slowdown in growth.\u201d Moody\u2019s said the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote on 23 June was unlikely to be the major boost to UK exports predicted by some. A weak pound is, however, expected to push consumer price inflation higher, from 1% now to 2.2% in 2017 before falling again to 1.7% in 2018. This is lower than other economists, including those at the Bank of England, have predicted. Forecasters at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) believe UK inflation will reach almost 3% next year. Duggar said: \u201cThere is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s economic outlook, since it depends on the ultimate outcome of a multi-year trade negotiation process with the EU, and other economies. Our baseline growth scenario for the UK assumes that it would be able to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU. \u201cHowever, a failure to negotiate could substantially worsen sentiment, triggering a material correction in asset prices, a house price downturn, and more substantial declines in investment and consumption spending. The rise in protectionist discourse globally could also prove to be a hurdle for the UK, and challenge long-term prospects.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s advertising group, WPP, has called an end to the Brexit shock that has hammered the ad market since the EU referendum vote in June and upgraded its forecast for the industry. The world\u2019s largest marketing services company, which manages more than $100bn (\u00a379bn) a year in advertising spend through its Group M media arm, said it was surprised to be upping its forecasts for ad spending in 2016 and 2017, describing the short-term impact of the Brexit vote as negligible. The upgrade comes as more retailers unveil their Christmas adverts. Sainsbury\u2019s advert is a short animation with James Corden on vocal duties, while Waitrose tells the story of an arduous journey home for a young robin. Group M is upgrading its original forecast of 6.3% growth to 7.2% this year, and from 5.8% to 7.2% for next year, which would make the total UK market worth \u00a318.8bn. Adam Smith, futures director at Group M, said: \u201cWhile the effect of the future European Union exit on the UK is unknown, the short-term impact was negligible. To our surprise, we are revising UK advertising growth up.\u201d However, this growth is being almost totally fuelled by spending on digital advertising, with \u201cpure-play digital\u201d companies such as Google and Facebook hoovering up the lion\u2019s share. The report continues to highlight tough market conditions for traditional media owners such as TV companies and newspaper and magazine publishers. Group M has moved to downgrade its forecast for traditional media spending from -1.1% to -2.6% this year and from 0.5% growth to -1.4% in 2017. Even factoring in digital ad income, the national newspaper ad market is expected to contract by 12% this year and another 9% next year. \u201cPrint brands donate content to Facebook in hopes of generating return traffic [and revenue] but seem disappointed,\u201d said Group M. \u201cFacebook is a simpler, better-sold alternative to print\u2019s competing panoply.\u201d For TV broadcasters, growth has been cut from 7.4% at the beginning of this year to just 2.6% by year end. Group M has cut is 2017 TV ad growth forecast from 4% to just 1%. Many analysts believe that this is too rosy and that the \u00a34.5bn UK TV ad market could contract by as much as 4% next year. ITV, which will be banking on big debut ratings early next year for The Voice which it poached from the BBC for \u00a350m, has already announced it is cutting 120 jobs. Last week, the broadcaster, which has had recent success with drama Victoria and revived comedy Cold Feet, revealed it was facing a 7% TV ad decline in the final quarter, its worst drop in the period running up to Christmas since 2008. Adam Crozier, ITV\u2019s chief executive, looked to ease investor nerves, explaining that \u00a350m in savings planned for next year would allow it to handle a fall of up to 3.5% in its own TV ad revenues next year. Group M expects Google and Facebook, which already take about three-quarters of all new digital ad spending in the UK, are set to make life harder, mounting an attack on the broadcasters\u2019 big spending advertisers that are also identified as \u201crelatively light on digital\u201d spend. The media group has identified five categories of advertisers \u2013 including retail, food and cosmetics and personal care \u2013 that spend a combined \u00a31.5bn on TV advertising annually, a third of the total, as targets for the internet giants. \u201c[Google and Facebook] will target these categories more aggressively in the future,\u201d said Group M. \u201cThere is a limit to what they can take from rivals and from print. TV is a tempting target. The ambition of pure-play digital vendors to conquer TV territory and categories will be hard-won, but today\u2019s undisputed winner is pure-play digital.\u201d The UK\u2019s top five spending TV advertisers are Procter &amp; Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Sky, Unilever and BT which spend a combined \u00a3400m annually.",

It will launch on social media and air for the first time on TV during I\u2019m a Celebrity ...

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has stepped up its battle with John Lewis to be the UK\u2019s most popular Christmas ad with an animated West End musical-style story with James Corden on vocals. The supermarket will launch its three-minute ad, which took seven weeks to animate using hitech 3D-printing techniques never previously used in the UK, on Monday, making it the last of the major retailers to kick off its festive campaign. The upbeat film features the story of busy dad Dave who comes up with the plan of creating toy replicas of himself to stand in for him at work so that he can spend time with his family over Christmas. It will launch on social media and air for the first time on TV during I\u2019m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here on ITV. With increasing numbers of people watching programmes online or via catch-up, or recorded services where they can skip ads, companies are having to battle hard to grab attention during the busiest time of the year. As well as Sainsbury\u2019s, which beat John Lewis to be the most popular ad last year with 30m views of its Mog film on YouTube, Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and even Aldi have short-story films this year. The Sainsbury\u2019s ad, which retains the tagline \u201cChristmas is for Sharing\u201d used in previous years, will have a charitable link. Profits from a range of merchandise, including a gingerbread version of Dave and an animation kit, will go towards family accommodation at Great Ormond Street hospital for children. Sarah Kilmartin, who is in charge of broadcast communications at Sainsbury\u2019s, said the company did not have a specific fundraising target but raised \u00a31.4m for Save the Children last year from merchandise related to its Christmas ad and customer donations. She would not reveal how much Sainsbury\u2019s had spent on the ad, but last year the company spent almost \u00a322m on advertising over Christmas. Directed by Sam Fell, an alumni of Wallace and Gromit maker Aardman Animations who went on to make comedy zombie animation ParaNorman, the film does not feature any Sainsbury\u2019s products directly. However, unlike in the three previous years, when the supermarket ads were based on the Judith Kerr character Mog, a heartwarming tale of friendship on the battlefield, and a mash-up of Christmas home videos, Sainsbury\u2019s has found a way to link this year\u2019s ad to its stores. Animators created tiny versions of Sainsbury\u2019s prosecco, Christmas cards and homewares to fill the houses of the multi-racial mix of families who are in Dave\u2019s world.

With Brexit negotiations expected to begin once article 50 is triggered next year, businesses are calling on the government to ensure that any new border controls \u2013 for customs or security \u2013 do not slow travel times and put jobs at risk. The report into the Channel tunnel, conducted by the accountancy firm EY on behalf of the operators, says the 22-year-old link has fundamentally changed the way the UK does business and that 220,000 jobs now depend on the rapid transit of goods the tunnel enables. Steve Hanley-Cook, an executive at parcel delivery service DHL, said: \u201cHistorically the tunnel has provided transit time advantages such as efficient border checks and customs controls. It is, however, important, in light of upcoming changes to trade relations between the UK and continental Europe, that any agreement does not seek to dilute these advantages.\u201d About 30% of UK exports, worth \u00a343.6bn, and 22% of imports from Europe, worth \u00a347.8bn, flow through the tunnel each year. Supermarkets use the tunnel to receive multiple daily deliveries of fresh produce from the continent, instead of warehousing the goods in the UK. Carmakers and plants that use iron and other metals rely on the tunnel to send and receive manufacturing components. The West Midlands exports the most using the tunnel, followed by the east of England. Scotland uses it to sell \u00a3300m of fish, fruit, vegetables and flowers annually.",
