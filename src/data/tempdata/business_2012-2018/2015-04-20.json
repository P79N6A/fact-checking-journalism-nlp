      "bodyText": "The competition regulator is to scrutinise allegations that UK supermarkets have duped shoppers out of hundreds of millions of pounds through misleading pricing tactics. Which? has lodged the first ever super-complaint against the grocery sector after compiling a dossier of \u201cdodgy multi-buys, shrinking products and baffling sales offers\u201d and sending it to the Competition and Markets Authority. The consumer group claims supermarkets are pushing illusory savings and fooling shoppers into choosing products they might not have bought if they knew the full facts. Examples raised by Which? include Tesco flagging the \u201cspecial value\u201d of a sweetcorn sixpack when a smaller pack was proportionately cheaper, and Asda raising the individual price of a product when it was part of a multi-buy offering in order to make the deal more attractive. Richard Lloyd, the group\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cDespite Which? repeatedly exposing misleading and confusing pricing tactics, and calling for voluntary change by the retailers, these dodgy offers remain on numerous supermarket shelves. Shoppers think they\u2019re getting a bargain but in reality it\u2019s impossible for any consumer to know if they\u2019re genuinely getting a fair deal.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re saying enough is enough, and using one of the most powerful legal weapons in our armoury to act on behalf of consumers by launching a super-complaint to the regulator. We want an end to misleading pricing tactics and for all retailers to use fair pricing that people can trust.\u201d The cumulative impact of all these different pricing tactics is that it is impossible for people to know if they are getting a fair deal, the consumer group says, particularly when prices vary frequently, consumers are in a hurry or are buying numerous low value items. About 40% of groceries in Britain are currently sold on promotion, according to the retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel. With \u00a3115bn spent on groceries and toiletries in 2013, Which? said consumers could be collectively losing out to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds. The right to make a super-complaint to the CMA or an industry regulator is limited to a small number of consumer bodies such as Which? and Energywatch. Once Which? has submitted its dossier to the CMA, the regulator has 90 days to respond. As a first step the CMA could request a market study, in which it could demand further information from the supermarkets themselves, before escalating to a full-blown investigation. A decade ago Citizens Advice helped bring the payment protection insurance scandal to public attention by lodging a super-complaint with the now-defunct Office of Fair Trading. Which? has previously made super-complaints on care homes, credit card interest rates, Northern Ireland banking, private dentistry and the Scottish legal profession. Meanwhile, new research suggests that more than 1,400 suppliers to Britain\u2019s supermarkets are facing collapse as the cut-throat price war takes its toll on the industry. The number of food and beverage makers in significant financial distress has nearly doubled to 1,414 in the last year, according to insolvency practitioner Begbies Traynor. The findings will increase the pressure on the government and the groceries code adjudicator to take action to protect suppliers and prevent large companies from delaying payments or changing agreed terms. Examples Which? sent to the CMA Seasonal offers: higher prices only applied out of season, when consumers are less likely to buy the item. It found a Nestle Kit Kat Chunky Collection Giant Egg was advertised at \u00a37.49 for 10 days in January this year at Ocado, then sold on offer at \u00a35 for 51 days. Was/now pricing: the use of a higher \u201cwas\u201d price when the item has been available for longer at the lower price. Acacia honey and ginger hot cross buns at Waitrose were advertised at \u00a31.50 for just 12 days this year before going on offer at \u201c\u00a31.12 was \u00a31.50\u201d for 26 days. Multi-buys: prices are increased on multi-buy deals so that the saving is less than claimed. Asda increased the price of a Chicago Town Four Cheese Pizza two-pack from \u00a31.50 to \u00a32 last year and then offered a multi-buy deal at two for \u00a33. A single pack went back to \u00a31.50 when the \u201coffer\u201d ended. Larger pack, better value: the price of individual items in the bigger pack are actually higher. Tesco sold four cans of Green Giant sweetcorn for \u00a32 last year, but six cans were proportionately more expensive in its \u201cspecial value\u201d pack, priced at \u00a33.56.",

For now Greece\u2019s troubles are contained within Greek markets but once the positive sentiment from Chinese stimulus has worn off, other European markets may follow suit closer to the Eurogroup meeting on Friday. This cash call is the latest sign that Greece is running perilously low on funds, without any new bailout funds from its creditors. It must pay 1.7bn euros of public sector wages and pensions at the end of this month, and 200m euros to the IMF at the start of May. Economists had warned that reserves were very low. As Gabriel Sterne of the consultancy Oxford Economics put it to us: \u201cIt is more of a question of what barrel they can still scrape to find some money to stave off default.\u201d Unless Greece and its lenders reach some deal soon, Athens may have to keep scraping. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s early take: The Greek government issued a decree that forces local governments to transfer all cash balances to the central bank, as a cash crunch worsens and debt to the International Monetary Fund comes due. \u201cCentral government entities are obliged to deposit their cash reserves and transfer their term deposit funds to their accounts at the Bank of Greece,\u201d the presidential decree issued Monday said on the government gazette website. The \u201cregulation is submitted due to extremely urgent and unforeseen need Some early reaction: Heads-up: Greece\u2019s government has just passed a decree to force local government authorities to place cash reserves at the central bank, according to local reports. The move shows Greece is taking steps to shore up its finances, to meet looming repayments. New data from the ECB shows that it continued to expand its balance sheet though its new QE programme last week (although the rate slowed slightly). Wall Street has followed Europe\u2019s lead, rising at the start of trading in New York: In other news, the boss of Russia\u2019s Gazprom is due to visit Athens tomorrow and meet with prime minister Alexis Tsipras. Over the weekend, Russia denied reports that it would soon sign a gas pipeline deal with Greece which could potentially yield \u20ac5bn for the Greek government. So Alexei Miller\u2019s \u201cworking visit\u201d will be closely watched.... Concern over Greece\u2019s negotiations with its creditors continues to swirl through the eurozone today. A series of top politicians and officials have urged Athens to speed up the pace, with fears that the country could default on a debt repayment soon unless The IMF\u2019s top man in Europe, Poul Thomsen, struck an optimistic note this morning, saying that talks over the weekend had made some progress. There has been a little bit more impetus in the negotiations between the three institutions and the Greek government for several days.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good development and gives us reason to hope.\u201d But fears are growing that the crisis could escalate rapidly without serious progress. Cyprus\u2019s finance minister urged both sides to reach a deal quickly, to avoid a repeat of the Cypriot crisis two year ago. Harris Georgiades also warned that a Grexit would be \u201cunchartered water, for which no planning can be fully adequate\u201d. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, predicted that we could easily see a Graccidental default. El-Erian sees little chance of a breakthrough this week, writing: The realist would point out that there is a 90% chance that no decisive breakthrough is achieved, and that Greece and the euro zone experience an intensification of recurrent tensions and political stalemates, either immediately or down the road. Austria\u2019s Ewald Nowotny, though, had argued that a Grexit would be more manageable than two years ago. The euro has weakened this morning, dragged down by Greek fears. And Greek bond yields have soared again, some hitting their highest levels since the crisis began: Analysts are also digesting the impact of Finland\u2019s general election, and the prospect of the eurosceptic Finns party joining the government. Open Europe\u2019s Mats Persson reckons this could make a third Greek bailout politically trickier, but not impossible. Ultimately, however, it\u2019s unlikely that Finland will veto a third Greek bailout on its own accord (Finns MP may be given permission to abstain in any such vote, for example.) Helsinki will likely following Berlin\u2019s line on the issue. And back in Greece, the prosecution of the extremist Golden Dawn party was adjourned after just two hours today, with reports circulating that a witness had been attacked. Here are some photos from the scene: Interesting.... Bloomberg columnist David Powell suggests that Greece could struggle on until July 20 without a deal. He\u2019a arguing that the European Central Bank could still provide emergency funding, even if Greece failed to make scheduled repayments to the IMF in May and June: Is he right? Well, I\u2019d hate to second-guess Mario Draghi on this issue. But it seems very likely that Greek savers would be spooked if an IMF payment was missed; so an intensified bank run could bring the crisis to a head quickly. Royal Bank at Scotland\u2019s economist team reckons Greeks will be heading back to the polls soon: Reuters have now published the full quotes from Ewald Nowotny about how Greece\u2019s exit from the eurozone would be less serious than in 2013: \u201cIt (a Greek exit) does not have that impact or potential impact on the euro zone as it would have had ... some two years ago. I really don\u2019t see a contagion in the financial and economic sense.\u201d Nowotny added, though that he could not predict the \u201cpsychological effect\u201d of Grexit, and urged Athens to provide \u201cnumbers\u201d, concluding \u201cTime is running out.\u201d Austria\u2019s top central banker has just raised the stakes over Greece, by declaring that a Greek exit from the eurozone wouldn\u2019t be as serious as in the past. Interviewed by CNBC, Ewald Nowotny also warned that a deal this week is unlikely. ECB\u2019S NOWOTNY SAYS WHEN ASKED ABOUT GREEK EXIT FROM EURO, IT WOULD NOT HAVE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON EURO ZONE AS IT WOULD HAVE TWO YEARS AGO- TV ECB\u2019S NOWOTNY SAYS NUMBERS HAVE TO BE PROVIDED BY GREEK GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH NEW PROGRAMME - TV ECB\u2019S NOWOTNY SAYS FEARS DEAL WILL NOT BE READY FOR EURO ZONE FINANCE MINISTERS MEETING THIS WEEK - TV ECB\u2019S NOWOTNY SAYS EUROPEAN ECONOMY CLEARLY IMPROVING - TV Bloomberg\u2019s Hans Nichols says it\u2019s a worrying sign: The euro is suffering from Greek uncertainty today. The single currency has fallen 0.7% against the US dollar today to $1.073. It\u2019s down 0.5% against sterling too, at 71.9p -- meaning one pound is now worth \u20ac1.391. Ilya Spivak, Currency Strategist, at DailyFX, explains: \u201cThe Euro has come back under pressure to start the week amid ominous comments about the festering crisis in Greece. ECB policymaker Christian Noyer said the country may not find collateral for loans and warned that its exit from the Eurozone would be traumatic for the region as well as the world economy at large.\u201d (see earlier post for details) Greece\u2019s three-year bond is now yielding almost 28% this morning, as its price falls further below its face value: Here\u2019s our Athens correspondent on today\u2019s Golden Dawn trial: The IMF may indeed be hopeful (see opening post). But there\u2019s only a 10% chance of a significant breakthrough over Greece\u2019s debts, according to Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. El-Erian reckons that both sides could hammer out a temporary deal that buys more time, but there\u2019s as much risk of failure, possibly leading to a chaotic exit from the euro. He writes: There is a 45 percent chance that a last minute messy compromise allows the muddling-through to continue; a 10 percent chance that a meaningful policy breakthrough will be achieved, and a 45 percent chance that the outcome is a Graccident in which both the Greek government and its European partners lose control of the situation. Under this third scenario, a series of Greek payment defaults, bank runs and the imposition of capital controls would force Greece out of the single currency. An optimist would espouse the 45 percent probability that a muddle-through compromise materializes at the 11th hour (or, to be more accurate, at 5 minutes to midnight). The realist would point out that there is a 90 percent chance that no decisive breakthrough is achieved, and that Greece and the euro zone experience an intensification of recurrent tensions and political stalemates, either immediately or down the road. There\u2019s still an opportunity for \u201cvisionary policy making\u201d to end the crisis, but time is running out, El-Erian concludes. Over in Greece, the trial of scores of Golden Dawn party members began his morning, and was almost immediately adjourned until May 7. Sixty nine members of the extreme right-wing Golden Dawn party faces charges of running a criminal organisation, following the death of left-wing rapper Pavlos Fyssas in September 2013. More than 40 of the defendants appeared in court today, but the trial was then adjourned for more than a fortnight, than amid reports that prosecution witnesses had been attacked. Kathmerini newspaper reports: Journalists were told that witnesses of Fyssas\u2019s murder were attacked by Golden Dawn supporters as they arrived at Korydallos Prison. Details of the alleged incident were not immediately available but the police was notified. Fyssas, a well-known campaigner against fascism in Greece, died after being stabbed on September 18th 2013 in Athens. Outrage over the killing prompted a crackdown against the party, which entered parliament on an anti-immigration platform. There was tight security outside the specially built courtroom, where anti-racist groups and unions held a protest march. Cyprus\u2019s finance minister just urged the Greek government and its creditors to make progress \u201cwithout delay\u201d. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Harris Georgiades said Greece can avoid the banking crisis and capital controls that gripped Cyprus in 2013, if both sides act quickly. I would hope Greece does not go through a similar situation\u2026. it can definitely be avoided. Greece has made some progress, Georgiades said, but now it must \u201cspecify and agree with the institutions on the details.... I hope that this happens soon\u201d. Georgiades hopes that progress is made in time for Friday\u2019s eurogroup meeting, warning that: \u201cIf we do not receive feedback on good progress... that will be negative.\u201d Georgiades also declines to say whether Cyprus has taken contingency planning for a Grexit, as \u2018no planning\u2019 could possibly be comprehensive enough. Such an outcome would imply we are entering unchartered water, for which no planning can be fully adequate\u2026.. and that\u2019s why I\u2019m not even willing to speculate or discuss an outcome which the Greek government itself has ruled out. Turning back to Finland\u2019s general election quickly, and this chart shows how the next government will take control of a country in a significant economic hole: The demise of Nokia, the erosion of its lumber industry, and the economic problems of neighbouring Russia have all hurt Finland. At the same time, pressure to keep to eurozone deficit targets forced the previous government into deep spending and welfare cuts. The Greek bond selloff is intensifying, pushing yields higher into the danger zone. European investors are shrugging off the Greek crisis, pushing shares up in early trading. The FTSE 100 is up almost 1%, led by mining stocks. That follows the China\u2019s central bank\u2019s decision to ease monetary policy last night. The PBOC cut the amount of capital that commercial banks must hold, freeing up more money for lending, which could prevent the economy slowing [good news for the miners]. Curiously, Chinese stocks defied expectations and fell today; on fears of further measures to rein speculative trading. Stan Shamu of IG reckons European investors may become less concerned with Greece as the rest of the region recovers: With most of the region seeing signs of bottoming in data, I feel it\u2019s not long before investors focus on the fundamentals and pay less attention to the Greece risk. A depressing reminder of the social damage suffered since the financial crisis began: European commissioner Pierre Moscovici sounded like a man tapping his watch with increasing impatience this morning. He told France\u2019s iTele TV network that: \u201cWe really need - now, there is no time to lose - that the Greek government delivers the reforms we\u2019re asking for.\u201d Moscovici added that Plan A is for Greece to remain in the eurozone, and there is no Plan B. But there\u2019s also no time for prevarication.... Greek bonds are weakening this morning, as fears of a default linger over the bond market. This has pushed up the yield on its three, five and 10-year bonds: Yields rise when prices fall, and these figures suggest a high risk that investors won\u2019t get all their money back. Simon Nixon of the WSJ is always worth reading about Greece; today\u2019s column warns that eurozone officials are preparing for a \u2018messy\u2019 default. One option is that Greece fails to get a deal with its creditors (quite plausible), runs out of cash (ditto) and then defaults on a debt repayment payment. But that wouldn\u2019t immediately trigger Grexit, as Simon explains: How things play out after [a default] that will depend on who Greece decides to default on and the reaction of bank depositors. If Athens defaults on a government bond or loan, then the ECB will have to raise the price that banks pay to access emergency liquidity from the Bank of Greece, effectively depriving them of access to fresh supplies of euros. If Athens decides instead to default to its own citizens, perhaps by issuing IOUs to pay pensions and salaries, bank customers may start emptying euros from their accounts. Again, banks would quickly run out of collateral for emergency liquidity. In both cases, Athens would have to introduce capital controls and bank holidays to stop the financial system imploding. Some officials believe Greece could carry on for several weeks if not months in this state of limbo while still technically remaining part of the eurozone.... That limbo could see the banks shut, capital controls imposed, and perhaps a new election? Other governments, though, reckon the situation would deteriorate so quickly that Greece would be rapidly ejected from the eurozone.... Greek banks risk running out of the collateral they need to keep accessing emergency funding from the European Central Bank, the head of the Bank of France has warned. Christian Noyer told Le Figaro that the lifeline being provided by the ECB couldn\u2019t last forever: \u201cAt some point, Greek banks are likely to be unable to offer enough collateral to access refinancing even for emergency liquidity.\u201d Noyer added that a Grexit would be traumatic for the whole eurozone, but particularly for Greece itself. [by collateral, Noyer means the assets that Greek banks hand over as security in return for euros from the ECB, allowing them to keep running] There was drama in the north of the eurozone last night, as Finland eurosceptic Finns party surged to second place in the country\u2019s general election. The Finns secured 38 seats, while the opposition Centre party came first with 49. This pushed prime minister Alexander Stubb\u2019s centre-right National Coalition into third place, with 37 seats. The Centre Party, led by telecoms millionaire Juha Sipil\u00e4, must now put together a coalition. And if he invites the Finns into office too, that could complicate the chances of agreeing a third bailout for Greece. Timo Soini, leader of Finns, has already vowed to change\u2019s Finland\u2019s approach to Greece. saying: I believe Finland\u2019s policy towards Greece will change [if he joined the government]. It will change for the better, because it can\u2019t get any worse\u201d. Finland\u2019s economy has been struggling for several years, and now faces a bout of austerity; Sipil\u00e4 had pledged a wage freeze and spending cuts to make it competitive again. Here\u2019s your regular reminder of the debt repayments and wage bills that Greece faces: Note that Greece owes \u20ac780m to the IMF on May 12, the day after the Eurogroup meeting that is now the crunch deadline for a deal. Many investors are doubtful that Greece will reach a deal with its creditors in time to avoid a default. With hopes of a deal at this Friday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting now pretty much sunk, City experts are speculating about how much cash the country can find. My colleague Katie Allen has been speaking to the experts, and reports: \u201cAlthough time is running short, there are clear indications that the Eurogroup meeting in Riga on 24 April might not bring a breakthrough,\u201d said Reinhard Cluse, an economist at the bank UBS. \u201cIn the absence of a deal in the next few weeks, the government might not be able to avoid default, which \u2013 we fear \u2013 would likely raise the risk of \u2018Grexit\u2019 [a Greek exit].\u201d Greece faces a series of repayments and interest payments on its debts in the coming weeks as well as its usual pensions and public-sector salary obligations. Experts say money is running out. \u201cAs to how much funds they have left to pay back maturing debt, it is almost zero,\u201d said Gabriel Sterne at the consultancy Oxford Economics. \u201cIt is more of a question of what barrel they can still scrape to find some money to stave off default.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another strained weak for the eurozone, as negotiations over Greece\u2019s bailout drag on. Greek officials spent last weekend in talks with its creditors, in an attempt to reach agreement on economic reforms to unlock some aid. IMF chief Poul Thomsen, director of the IMF\u2019s European Department, has declared that the talks have now picked up pace, but still have a long way to go. Thomsen says (via Germany\u2019s Handelsblatt newspaper): \u201cThere has been a little bit more impetus in the negotiations between the three institutions and the Greek government for several days.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good development and gives us reason to hope.\u201d Thomsen cautioned, though, that the two sides are still \u201cfar from the target\u201d. Over the weekend, ECB chief Mario Draghi and US Treasury Secretary both warned that the situation now was now \u201curgent\u201d. As Draghi put it: \u201cWe all want Greece to succeed. The answer is in the hands of the Greek government.\u201d But despite rising pressure last week, Greece\u2019s government insists \u2013 in public at least \u2013 that it will not roll over. Deputy PM Yiannis Dragasakis said yesterday that Athen would not \u201cbudge from our red lines.\u201d That suggests no agreement is close on issues like pension reform, labour market liberalization, VAT hikes and privatizations. Dragasakis also floated the suggestion of \u201csnap elections or a referendum\u201d if a deal isn\u2019t reached. We\u2019re rattling towards Friday\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance chiefs, but the new \u2018finally final\u2019 deadline appears to be the next full Eurogroup meeting on May 11. If Greece and its creditors haven\u2019t hammered out a deal by then, the situation could turn quite messy. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day....",

Gulliver was speaking in Hong Kong, where the bank was holding an informal meeting with shareholders before its annual general meeting in London, when it is expected that the Swiss scandal, executive pay and the domicile of the bank will be questioned by investors.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In whatever direction the businessman Allen Sheppard had chosen to take his career, he would have been certain of one thing: that he was going to be in charge. Such was his natural authority that those around him at companies such as Ford, British Leyland and Grand Metropolitan had no problem in accepting the same thing. Once voted in a Sunday Times poll as \u201cBritain\u2019s toughest boss\u201d, Sheppard, who has died aged 82, was in fact no hard driving, misanthropic manager, motivated entirely by the bottom line. He could be surprisingly self-deprecating, had a sense of humour that was obvious in the twinkle in his eye, and would pull the leg of anyone of any rank in the social hierarchy, up to and including the Prince of Wales, with whom he worked through the Prince\u2019s business charities. Sheppard described his management style as a \u201cloose grip on the throat\u201d. Those who worked with him knew exactly where they stood, and what was expected of them. But on the other hand he was a boss who would stand up for his employees. When his director of communications at the property and leisure conglomerate Grand Metropolitan was fired by the then chairman just before the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, Sheppard demanded his immediate reinstatement, on the threat that his own resignation would be announced too. He meant it, and the reinstatement went ahead with no further discussion. Sheppard was the son of John, a train driver, and Lily (nee Palmer), a part-time bank clerk. His mother\u2019s hopes of becoming a teacher had been thwarted by a lack of money to pay for training, and she was determined that Allen\u2019s prospects should not suffer similarly. He went to Ilford county high school in Essex, and while there joined the Labour party (a result of his mother\u2019s influence), establishing a reputation as a dedicated young activist who might go far in politics. He gained an economics degree from the London School of Economics and in 1958, after completing his National Service and two years as a college lecturer, joined Ford as a financial analyst at the company\u2019s Dagenham plant. A decade later he switched to the car manufacturing Rootes Group, and then, in 1971, joined British Leyland as marketing director of its international division. By then he had begun to lose faith in socialism. Although he remained a passionate supporter of equality of opportunity, he was a firm believer in the words of one of his LSE lecturers that \u201cthe size of the cake is as important as how it should be divided\u201d. In 1975 he was invited to join the group with which his name will always be linked, Grand Metropolitan. His first job there was as chief executive of the Watney Mann &amp; Truman Brewers subsidiary. There he caught the eye of Maxwell Joseph, the extraordinary deal-maker who had built Grand Met into a multimillion-pound business. Sheppard was promoted to group managing director in 1982 and chief executive in 1986. One year later he added the chairmanship to the chief executive\u2019s role, holding both jobs through to 1993. He remained chairman until he retired in 1996. While at the group, he instituted and saw through a radical and successful reshaping of the entire enterprise in the belief that \u201cin business, one cannot stand still\u201d. In 1997 Grand Met merged with Guinness to form Diageo. Throughout the latter period of his working life, he put into practice his feeling that business should be working in the interests of the communities in which it operates, and that everyone deserves a chance to succeed. In the early 1990s he became involved in the Prince\u2019s Youth Business Trust and the International Business Leaders Forum. He was chair of Business in the Community from 1994 to 1997 and served on the council of the Prince\u2019s Business Trust from 1995 to 1998. He was also passionate about promoting London, serving on the board of a number of London-focused organisations, including London First, a non-profit body that aims to make London \u201cthe best city in the world in which to do business\u201d. He accumulated a number of non-executive directorships and picked up several honorary doctorates from universities. He also became increasingly interested in the Conservative party, accepting an invitation to join the party\u2019s board of management. His business success, political activities and charitable work brought him a knighthood in 1992 and, two years later, a peerage.

      "body": "<p>In whatever direction the businessman Allen Sheppard had chosen to take his career, he would have been certain of one thing: that he was going to be in charge. Such was his natural authority that those around him at companies such as Ford, British Leyland and Grand Metropolitan had no problem in accepting the same thing.</p> <p>Once voted in a Sunday Times poll as \u201cBritain\u2019s toughest boss\u201d, Sheppard, who has died aged 82, was in fact no hard driving, misanthropic manager, motivated entirely by the bottom line. He could be surprisingly self-deprecating, had a sense of humour that was obvious in the twinkle in his eye, and would pull the leg of anyone of any rank in the social hierarchy, up to and including the Prince of Wales, with whom he worked through the Prince\u2019s business charities.</p> <p>Sheppard described his management style as a \u201cloose grip on the throat\u201d. Those who worked with him knew exactly where they stood, and what was expected of them. But on the other hand he was a boss who would stand up for his employees. When his director of communications at the property and leisure conglomerate Grand Metropolitan was fired by the then chairman just before the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, Sheppard demanded his immediate reinstatement, on the threat that his own resignation would be announced too. He meant it, and the reinstatement went ahead with no further discussion.</p> <p>Sheppard was the son of John, a train driver, and Lily (nee Palmer), a part-time bank clerk. His mother\u2019s hopes of becoming a teacher had been thwarted by a lack of money to pay for training, and she was determined that Allen\u2019s prospects should not suffer similarly. He went to Ilford county high school in Essex, and while there joined the Labour party (a result of his mother\u2019s influence), establishing a reputation as a dedicated young activist who might go far in politics. He gained an economics degree from the London School of Economics and in 1958, after completing his National Service and two years as a college lecturer, joined Ford as a financial analyst at the company\u2019s Dagenham plant.</p> <p>A decade later he switched to the car manufacturing Rootes Group, and then, in 1971, joined British Leyland as marketing director of its international division. By then he had begun to lose faith in socialism. Although he remained a passionate supporter of equality of opportunity, he was a firm believer in the words of one of his LSE lecturers that \u201cthe size of the cake is as important as how it should be divided\u201d.</p> <p>In 1975 he was invited to join the group with which his name will always be linked, Grand Metropolitan. His first job there was as chief executive of the Watney Mann &amp; Truman Brewers subsidiary. There he caught the eye of Maxwell Joseph, the extraordinary deal-maker who had built Grand Met into a multimillion-pound business. Sheppard was promoted to group managing director in 1982 and chief executive in 1986. One year later he added the chairmanship to the chief executive\u2019s role, holding both jobs through to 1993. He remained chairman until he retired in 1996. While at the group, he instituted and saw through a radical and successful reshaping of the entire enterprise in the belief that \u201cin business, one cannot stand still\u201d. In 1997 Grand Met merged with Guinness to form Diageo.</p> <p>Throughout the latter period of his working life, he put into practice his feeling that business should be working in the interests of the communities in which it operates, and that everyone deserves a chance to succeed. In the early 1990s he became involved in the Prince\u2019s Youth Business Trust and the International Business Leaders Forum. He was chair of Business in the Community from 1994 to 1997 and served on the council of the Prince\u2019s Business Trust from 1995 to 1998. He was also passionate about promoting London, serving on the board of a number of London-focused organisations, including London First, a non-profit body that aims to make London \u201cthe best city in the world in which to do business\u201d.</p> <p>He accumulated a number of non-executive directorships and picked up several honorary doctorates from universities.

      "bodyText": "The Greek government has issued a decree forcing public sector bodies to transfer idle cash reserves to the central bank in a sign of how severe the country\u2019s cash crunch has become. The order came as the country\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, issued a stark warning to eurozone neighbours that they were playing with fire as Athens edges closer to a debt default. Fears of a Greek exit from the eurozone have increased as signs grow that the country is on the brink of bankruptcy. The state is scrambling to find funds to pay almost \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.4bn) in wages and pensions and almost \u20ac1bn to the International Monetary Fund in the coming weeks. The language in Monday\u2019s presidential decree provides an insight into just how tight finances have become for Greece\u2019s recently elected anti-austerity government, led by Alexis Tsipras\u2019s Syriza. \u201cCentral government entities are obliged to deposit their cash reserves and transfer their term deposit funds to their accounts at the Bank of Greece,\u201d the news service Bloomberg quoted the decree on the government gazette website as saying. The \u201cregulation is submitted due to extremely urgent and unforeseen needs\u201d, it said. Greece owes money to the IMF, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European commission following two bailouts totalling \u20ac240bn in 2010 and 2012. Athens is waiting for the final \u20ac7.2bn payment under the most recent bailout package, but the money has been held up after the country\u2019s leftwing government scrapped previous commitments to privatise state assets and cut welfare provision. Economists have predicted that without the rescue funds, Greece is unlikely to make the salary and pensions payments and settle its dues with the IMF. They say Greece is edging closer to a default on its debt obligations that could precipitate the country\u2019s exit from the eurozone. Varoufakis used one of his frequent media appearances to say that contagion would be inevitable if Greece were to leave the eurozone. \u201cAnyone who toys with the idea of cutting off bits of the eurozone hoping the rest will survive is playing with fire,\u201d he told the Spanish TV channel La Sexta. \u201cSome claim that the rest of Europe has been ringfenced from Greece and that the ECB has tools at its disposal to amputate Greece, if need be, cauterise the wound and allow the rest of eurozone to carry on. \u201cI very much doubt that that is the case. Not just because of Greece but for any part of the union,\u201d he said. Eurozone finance ministers meet for further talks on Greece on Friday, but no breakthrough is expected. Focus is already shifting to early May when IMF payments are due. With money running out, Greece has been trying to convince its international creditors to release the last chunk of rescue funds. Many of its fellow eurozone countries, however, and Germany in particular, say they first want clearer commitments to reforms from Tsipras and his government. There are growing worries on the financial markets that the slow progress in negotiations means Greece will not be able to meet May\u2019s debt deadlines. Yields on Greece\u2019s government bonds have been rising while those on German bonds fell again on Monday, meaning their price rose, as investors continued to chase safe-haven assets. After the gloomy tone at last week\u2019s IMF spring meetings in Washington on Greece and the eurozone\u2019s prospects, the fund\u2019s top man in Europe, Poul Thomsen, struck a more optimistic note on Monday. Talks over the weekend between Greece and the IMF, the ECB and the European commission had made some progress, he told Germany\u2019s Handelsblatt newspaper. \u201cThere has been a little bit more impetus in the negotiations between the three institutions and the Greek government for several days,\u201d Thomsen said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good development and gives us reason to hope.\u201d There were also encouraging comments from the ECB vice-president, Vitor Constancio, who played down the prospect of Greece leaving the eurozone. \u201cWe are convinced at the ECB that there will be no Greek exit,\u201d he told the European parliament. He added a note of caution, however, for anyone expecting ECB support for Greece and its banks to be unlimited. \u201cWe have been forthcoming, but I cannot promise \u2026 that we will fund Greece whatever the situation and the amount and the conditions,\u201d he said.",

Several senior executives of Australia\u2019s major banks, including the Commonwealth, the National Australia Bank, Macquarie Private Wealth, and the ANZ will make a rare appearance in Canberra before a Senate committee probing financial planning scandals. In addition to facing an interrogation on their controversial financial planning practices, the bosses are also expected to face questions on their interbank lending practices. Morris will appear on Tuesday before the banking executives give their evidence with a group of victims cleaned up by poor financial advice. On Monday night, en route to Canberra, Morris told Guardian Australia he would tell senators that a royal commission was necessary to ensure rogue financial planners faced the consequences of their actions. \u201cThe reason I blew the whistle was because I knew victims stood no chance against the banks,\u201d Morris said.

The then chairman of the committee, Labor senator Mark Bishop, said the conduct of Commonwealth Bank financial advisers was \u201cunethical, dishonest, well below professional standards and a grievous breach of their duties\u201d. Bishop said the planners \u201chad a callous disregard for their clients\u2019 interests\u201d. But the Abbott government has been cool on the notion of a royal commission into financial planning.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The tobacco industry attempted to reinterpret Islamic teaching and recruit Islamic scholars in a bid to undermine the prohibition on smoking in many Muslim countries, an investigation has shown. Evidence from archived industry documents from the 1970s to the late 1990s shows that tobacco companies were seriously concerned about Islamic teaching. In 1996, an internal document from British American Tobacco warned that, because of the spread of \u201cextremist views\u201d from fundamentalists in countries such as Afghanistan, the industry would have to \u201cprepare to fight a hurricane\u201d. BAT and other companies, which were losing sales in affluent countries where anti-smoking measures had been introduced, devised strategies to counter this perceived threat to sales in places such as Egypt, Indonesia and Bangladesh, which have large populations of young people who smoke. The industry was concerned that the World Health Organisation was encouraging the anti-smoking stance of Islamic leaders. A 1985 report from tobacco firm Philip Morris squarely blamed the WHO. \u201cThis ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO \u2026 The WHO has not only joined forces with Moslem fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause,\u201d it said. \u201cA Moslem who attacks smoking generally speaking would be a threat to existing government as a \u2018fundamentalist\u2019 who wishes to return to sharia law,\u201d says one of the archive documents. It adds: \u201cOur invisible defence must be the individualism which Islam allows its believers \u2026 smoking and other signs of modern living should encourage governments to a point at which it is possible quietly to suggest their benefits.\u201d It adds: \u201cWith Islam we might ask what other aspects of modern living are similarly open to extremist demands for prohibition under strict interpretation of sharia: motion pictures, television, and art depicting the human being? Use of electronic amplification by muezzin calling from a minaret? The education of women?\u201d the document says. The earliest fatwa against tobacco was in 1602, but many scholars believed smoking cigarettes or taking tobacco in water pipes or other forms was harmless until evidence of the dangers to health began to emerge in the mid 20th century. Jurists pronounced that tobacco use was makrooh (discouraged). In many Islamic countries, a harder line was taken, with smoking prohibited on the grounds that the Qur\u2019an does not permit self-harm or intoxication. The WHO negotiated the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, starting in 1999, in response to what it describes as the \u201cexplosive increase in tobacco use\u201d. The convention, which outlines strategies intended to reduce demand, was adopted in 2003. A report in 2000 from the Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (Cora) department at BAT after the first international negotiations said: \u201cIt appears that the WHO\u2019s efforts to link religion (specifically Islam) with issues surrounding the use of tobacco are bearing fruit \u2026 We will need to discuss separately how we might understand and manage this aspect in line with the Cora strategy.\u201d The tobacco industry attempted to re-interpret anti-smoking Islamic teachings. A 1996 BAT memo suggests identifying \u201ca scholar/scholars, preferably at the Al Azhar University in Cairo, who we could then brief and enlist as our authoritative advisers/allies and occasionally spokespersons on the issue. \u201cWe agreed that such scholars/authority would need to be paired up with an influential Moslem writer/journalist \u2026 such advice would present the most effective and influential opinion able to counter extremist views, which are generally peddled by Islamic fundamentalist preachers largely misinterpreting the Koran \u2026 This is an issue to be handled extremely gingerly and sensitively \u2026 We have to avoid all possibilities of a backlash.\u201d Tobacco industry lawyers were also involved in this attempt at revision. A presentation from 2000, prepared by the firm Shook, Hardy and Bacon, gave an overview of the background to Islam and smoking, with slides stating that there is no prohibition on smoking in the Qur\u2019an \u2013 and that \u201cmaking rules beyond what Allah has allowed is a sin in itself\u201d. Prof Mark Petticrew from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the research, said he was amazed by what researchers had found in the archives. \u201c\u2018You couldn\u2019t make it up\u2019 comes to mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing that jumps out at me from all this is the fact that we had tobacco industry lawyers actually developing theological arguments. That was pretty surprising.\u201d A document suggest Philip Morris wanted to try to recruit Islamic scholars at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. A representative of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers\u2019 Council \u201cagreed to make exploratory contact\u201d, it says. Petticrew and his team do not know whether they were successful. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find the papers,\u201d he said. The tobacco industry is still heavily promoting smoking in countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt, which are predominantly Muslim and have high proportions of smokers. Its marketing is generally adapted to the \u201cnot overly devout\u201d, says the study. The authors call for further research to find out how the industry had approached other faiths. \u201cThe launch of the Faith Against Tobacco national campaign by Tobacco Free Kids and faith leaders in the US, for example, brings together Christianity, Islam, Judaism and other faiths \u2018to support proven solutions to reduce smoking\u2019. Understanding efforts by the industry to undermine the efforts of other faith communities brings to light a broader strategy to marginalise tobacco control in diverse communities, and refocuses the problem on tobacco-related health harms,\u201d says the paper. BAT told the Guardian. \u201cThis study, which concerns material written nearly 20 years ago, does not represent the views, policies and position of British American Tobacco. We are a global business that holds itself to strict standards of business conduct and corporate governance, manufacturing and marketing our products in accordance with domestic and international laws and observing the cultural and religious beliefs in the 200 countries in which we operate.\u201d Philip Morris did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment.",

A presentation from 2000, prepared by the firm Shook, Hardy and Bacon, gave an overview of the background to Islam and smoking, with slides stating that there is no prohibition on smoking in the Qur\u2019an \u2013 and that \u201cmaking rules beyond what Allah has allowed is a sin in itself\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Mark Petticrew from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the research, said he was amazed by what researchers had found in the archives. \u201c\u2018You couldn\u2019t make it up\u2019 comes to mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing that jumps out at me from all this is the fact that we had tobacco industry lawyers actually developing theological arguments.

      "bodyText": "The tax review discussion paper echoed the longtime call from business leaders for a cut to the company tax rate. But while Australia\u2019s company tax rate and our dependence upon such revenue is higher than most other nations, any cut to the tax rate would need to be financed by either increased revenue or reduce expenditure. Ending dividend imputation \u2013 where Australian shareholders receive a credit for company tax when they pay tax on dividends \u2013 would be a smart way to finance it, but it seems to be a path Joe Hockey is unwilling to take. Pretty much every review of taxation over the past quarter of a century has called for a cut in the company tax rate. Cutting the company tax rate is seen as almost a fast track to growth, and certainly all across the OECD, nations for the past 30 years have been cutting their company tax rates: In the 1980s Australia\u2019s company tax rate was between 46% and 49%, and at the time the average across the OECD was a rate of 48%. By 2003 the average OECD rate was 30% \u2013 the same as the rate here in Australia. Since then however, 28 of the 34 OECD nations have cut their company tax rate, to the point that the average is now around 25%, while Australia\u2019s rate remains at 30%: And yet while other nations were cutting their rates, we didn\u2019t for the very good reason that not only we didn\u2019t need to, we actually had more investment than we needed. The investment boom that occurred during the early-mid 2000s was so large that it helped fuel growth in the economy to the point where it was almost overheating. Inflation was rising and the danger was that too much investment was coming into the country at the same time. Cutting the corporate tax rate at that point would not only have served to throw gasoline on an investment bonfire, it would have also been a case of giving away tax revenue for no good purpose. We didn\u2019t need to do anything to attract investment \u2013 the iron ore in the ground was doing that for us. But now the mining investment boom is no more and thus the pressure is on to cut the company tax rate to encourage investment. This argument was made by the deputy secretary of the Treasury, Rob Heferen, in a speech just prior to the release of the taxation discussion paper. Heferen argued that cutting the company tax rate could also help improve productivity because it would \u201cincrease the capital available for existing labour\u201d \u2013 more technology and equipment for each worker to use. The other reason most tax reviews suggest we need to cut company tax rate is because Australia is more dependent on that revenue than most nations. In OECD nations, only Norway is more dependent on company tax revenue: Some context is needed, however. Australia has always been more dependent upon company tax revenue than most in the OECD. In 1969 we were the fourth most dependent, a position we still held in 1989, and by 1999 we were third: And remember this was during a period where our company tax rate was either on or below the OECD average. One reason our dependency upon company tax revenue is so high is because our companies have been quite profitable and as a result we raise a lot of company tax: Since 1965, Australia has raised on average 1.6 times the level of company tax revenue compared to the average across the OECD (measured as a percentage of GDP). On that score, our current level of around 1.8 times is not a significant increase. The Henry tax review in 2010 also looked at company tax rates and noted that while our rate of 30% was higher than others, that was partly due to differences in the measurement of such taxes across the OECD and also because our companies were rather more profitable than most firms across the OECD due to our \u201cnatural resources\u201d. Kevin Davis from the Australian Centre for Financial Studies noted that unlike most countries, one of the differences between tax measurements is that Australia has a dividend imputation regime. Most other nations have a \u201cclassical company tax system\u201d where the company pays tax on its profits and then shareholders also pay income tax on dividends they receive on top of that. We had that system until 1987 when Paul Keating introduced dividend imputation. Under the current system the shareholder is provided a rebate on the tax already paid by the company. This means that, for example, if you are in the top tax bracket you do not pay 47% tax on your dividend, but rather 47% less the 30% company tax. The ATO points out that under a classic tax regime in the case of a $100 profit, the company would pay $30 in company tax and the remaining $70 would go to the shareholder as a dividend. The shareholder (assuming they are in the top tax bracket) would then pay 47% tax on that $70 ($33) \u2013 leaving just $37 in net income from the dividend. Under the dividend imputation regime, the company still pays $30 in tax and the shareholder still gets a $70 dividend. But now the shareholder gets an imputation credit of that $30. It means investing in Australian companies by Australians is actually much more attractive than were we operating under a classical system. It also means the government raises less tax. Under the classical tax system the government would have raised $63 in revenue, under the current scheme it is just $47. Davis estimates the dividend imputation regime means for Australian investors our company tax rate is equivalent to around 16% of a \u201cclassical company tax rate\u201d. Similarly, in a 2006 paper for Lateral Economics, economist Nicholas Gruen suggested removing dividend imputation would allow cutting the rate to 19% tax rate without any hit to the budget. And certainly cutting the company tax rate would need to be balanced by increasing revenue or reducing spending elsewhere. Even an optimistic view would be that only around 50% of lost revenue from cutting the tax rate would be made up by increased investment. But the problem with cutting the tax rate or removing dividend imputation is that mostly overseas companies and current investors would benefit. Overseas investors are unable to access the dividend imputation regime \u2013 so they get the full benefit of any rate cut. For Australians the dividend imputation scheme means they would see little change as they would still be taxed at their marginal income tax rate and they would still get a credit through the dividend imputation system. Heferen noted as well that a company tax rate cut provides \u201ca windfall gain for existing investments, which were funded on the assumption of a higher company tax rate\u201d. Foreign investors would get all the benefit of the rate cut. Importantly, Heferen also notes that this money could leave the country. \u201cIf investors repatriate this gain, the Australian economy does not benefit,\u201d he said. In its submission to the corporate tax avoidance inquiry, David Richardson of the Australia Institute noted that while many suggest we need to lower our interest rate to attract investment, the reality is most of our foreign investment already \u201ccomes from Asian countries with much lower company tax rates\u201d. He also noted that the difference between Australia\u2019s company tax rate and most major economies was \u201csmall \u2013 plus or minus five points\u201d and that this \u201chardly matters compared with tax havens that often have no tax at all\u201d. Richardson also argued that only looking at company tax rates ignores the impact of the top marginal tax rate, and imputation. Looking at both sees \u201cwhat happens to a dollar of taxable corporate income by the time it is received in the hands of investors on the top marginal tax rate in that country\u201d. On this score we have the 14th highest rate and are just 3.4 percentage points above the average: For the moment, the treasurer Joe Hockey seems unlikely to touch either dividend imputation or even lower the company tax rate. He told the Australian Financial Review last week that dividend imputation had helped to \u201cinfluence the culture of the nation\u201d in becoming \u201cone of the biggest share-owning nations in the world\u201d. That\u2019s a pretty week argument. It\u2019s a bit like saying we can\u2019t get rid of negative gearing despite it distorting the housing market because it has helped introduce a culture of people buying investment properties. Also, nearly 50% of share dividends value goes to those in the top tax bracket: If we are to cut the company tax rate, removing the dividend imputation would be a progressive way to fund it. But given the number of self-funded superannuants who rely on dividends, Hockey would need to persuade them that the lower tax rate would see little change to their income and any new investment due to the tax cut would see the value of their shares rise. That\u2019s a tough sell, but for a treasurer desperate to find revenue and also looking to reform the tax system and encourage business, it might be one he needs to make.",

But given the number of self-funded superannuants who rely on dividends, Hockey would need to persuade them that the lower tax rate would see little change to their income and any new investment due to the tax cut would see the value of their shares rise.</p> <p>That\u2019s a tough sell, but for a treasurer desperate to find revenue and also looking to reform the tax system and encourage business, it might be one he needs to make. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The Queensland MP Billy Gordon, in his first public political foray since being forced out of the governing Labor party, has called for a review of how a Swiss mining giant won backing for a bauxite mine against the wishes of Indigenous landowners. Gordon has called on the Palaszczuk government to investigate whether the former Newman government had \u201cnot trampled on\u201d the legal rights of the Wik and Wik Way people by favouring Glencore for the mine project. The former Liberal National party government said Glencore was the \u201cpreferred proponent\u201d last August, shortly before the Wik people signed a land use agreement for the proposed mine with a local company, Aurukun Bauxite Development (ABD). In his first statement as an independent addressing matters outside his own political controversies, Gordon called on the state government to suspend the approval process for the mine while it examined what regard the Newman government gave to traditional landowners\u2019 rights. \u201cI am very concerned that critical due process may not have been administered by the Newman government in its oversight of such a significant and symbolic project,\u201d Gordon said. Gordon has sought an \u201curgent briefing\u201d from the state development minister, Anthony Lynham, about the actions of the former government and the former LNP minister Jeff Seeney, and \u201cwhether due process has occurred and that the legal rights of the Wik and Wik Way people have not been trampled upon\u201d. He called for an \u201cindependent review to examine the legal and administrative processes that have been undertaken by the Newman government to ensure that there is transparency, accountability, integrity and respect for Indigenous rights in the decision that has favoured Glencore and excluded the Wik and Wik Way people as registered land owners.\u201d Gordon said he met Wik and Wik Way representatives last Friday at state parliament. They had \u201ctravelled to the state capital to share their concerns and frustration over the previous Newman government\u2019s actions and behaviour\u201d. Gordon said he \u201cfelt humbled in their presence given the very significant role that [they] played in critical native title considerations in our nation\u201d. In 1996 the Wik fought successfully in the high court to have native title rights recognised beside certain pastoral leases granted since the occupation of Australia by Britain in 1788. Gordon quit the Labor party last month after the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, threatened to have him expelled over his undisclosed criminal history and after she referred domestic violence allegations against him to police. Gordon has rejected calls for him to quit parliament saying he had a legal right to withhold a criminal history that had been expunged and denying the allegations made against him.",
