      "body": "<p>For the first time ever, the 10 highest-paid chief executives in the US received more than $100m in compensation last year, and two took home billion-dollar paychecks, according to a leading annual survey of executive pay.</p> <p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder, was America's highest-paid boss in 2012, according to GMI Ratings annual poll of executive compensation, released on Tuesday. Zuckerberg's total compensation topped $2.27bn \u2013 more than $6m a day. His base salary was $503,205 but the vast majority of his enormous pay package came from exercising 60m Facebook share options when the company went public last year.</p> <p>Richard Kinder, the CEO and chairman of energy firm Kinder Morgan, had a base salary of just $1 in 2012 and received no other bonuses. But he made $1.1bn selling restricted stock. The payout follows a nearly $60m profit from stock in 2011.</p> <p>Half of the top 10 are company founders. The rest are appointed executives. The no 3 slot really belongs to Gregory Maffei, who appears twice in the list as CEO of Liberty Media and Liberty Interactive. He reaped a combined $391m from the two posts.</p> <p>All told, the top 10 CEOs in this year's poll took home over $4.7bn between them, and for the first time ever, none earned less than $100m.</p> <p>\"I have never seen anything like that,\" said Greg Ruel, GMI's senior research consultant and author of the report. \"Usually we have a few CEOs at the $100m-plus level but never the entire top 10.\"</p> <p>Father Seamus Finn, a corporate governance expert at Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, said the numbers were \"ridiculous\".</p> <p>\"It's an amazing number. Who knows how compensation committees come up with them?\"</p> <p>Finn, who has campaigned against what he sees as excessive remuneration at companies including Goldman Sachs, said boards often argued that they would lose talent unless they paid top management huge sums.</p> <p>\"But I've seen no evidence of that,\" he said. \"These huge pay deals are seldom linked to shareholder returns.\"</p> <p>Nearly all the outsized gains came from stock options and other share-related compensation. The top 10 made $3.3bn in 2012 on stock option profits and the vesting of restricted stock. Cash bonuses totalled $16.2m.</p> <p>Overall, GMI's poll of pay and other forms of compensation for 2,259 US CEOs found an average rise of 8.47%, less than the double-digit growth they have enjoyed for the past two years. But the average hides a more complex picture. This year's top earners far outstripped those below them by making huge fortunes cashing in share options as the stock markets bounced back.</p> <p>The report further illustrates the widening gap between CEO pay and that of the average worker. According to the US census bureau, median household income, adjusted for inflation, was $51,017 in 2012, broadly unchanged from 2011.</p> <p>Wages for the average household have fallen about 9% from an inflation-adjusted peak of $56,080 in 1999. The census figures show a sharp recovery for those at the top of the wage scale as those at the bottom continue to see falls.</p> <p>From 2009 to 2012, average real income per family grew modestly by 6.0%, according to a report issued last month by Berkeley University pair Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. However, the gains were very uneven. The top 1% incomes grew by 31.4%, while the bottom 99% incomes grew only by 0.4% from 2009 to 2012. The top 1% captured 95% of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery.</p> <p>The disparity is noticeable even among the 1%, where riches accrue to the very wealthiest at an even faster rate than those below.</p> <p>The average pay package of an S&amp;P 500 chief executive last year was $13.7m, according to GMI. For those in charge of S&amp;P small cap companies, it was $3.5m. The average rise in compensation for CEOs of the Russell 3,000 \u2013 which represents about 98% of all public US companies \u2013 was 8.47%. For the Russell 1,000 \u2013 measuring the top 1,000 companies \u2013 it was 15.47%.</p> <p>Base salaries, bonuses and other forms of compensation were largely unchanged in 2012. The survey found that the outsized pay increases experienced by some CEOs came from the exercise of large blocks of stock options and the vesting of outsized restricted stock grants.</p> <p>\"While stock options are intended to align the interests of senior executives with shareholders, the unintended consequence of these grants is often windfall profits that come from small share-price increases,\" GMI said in its report.</p> <p>\"With option grants numbering in the hundreds of thousands or even millions, CEOs at large companies in particular are able to profit by the millions for any positive gain over the strike price of their options.

      "bodyText": "For the first time ever, the 10 highest-paid chief executives in the US received more than $100m in compensation last year, and two took home billion-dollar paychecks, according to a leading annual survey of executive pay. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder, was America's highest-paid boss in 2012, according to GMI Ratings annual poll of executive compensation, released on Tuesday. Zuckerberg's total compensation topped $2.27bn \u2013 more than $6m a day. His base salary was $503,205 but the vast majority of his enormous pay package came from exercising 60m Facebook share options when the company went public last year. Richard Kinder, the CEO and chairman of energy firm Kinder Morgan, had a base salary of just $1 in 2012 and received no other bonuses. But he made $1.1bn selling restricted stock. The payout follows a nearly $60m profit from stock in 2011. Half of the top 10 are company founders. The rest are appointed executives. The no 3 slot really belongs to Gregory Maffei, who appears twice in the list as CEO of Liberty Media and Liberty Interactive. He reaped a combined $391m from the two posts. All told, the top 10 CEOs in this year's poll took home over $4.7bn between them, and for the first time ever, none earned less than $100m. \"I have never seen anything like that,\" said Greg Ruel, GMI's senior research consultant and author of the report. \"Usually we have a few CEOs at the $100m-plus level but never the entire top 10.\" Father Seamus Finn, a corporate governance expert at Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, said the numbers were \"ridiculous\". \"It's an amazing number. Who knows how compensation committees come up with them?\" Finn, who has campaigned against what he sees as excessive remuneration at companies including Goldman Sachs, said boards often argued that they would lose talent unless they paid top management huge sums. \"But I've seen no evidence of that,\" he said. \"These huge pay deals are seldom linked to shareholder returns.\" Nearly all the outsized gains came from stock options and other share-related compensation. The top 10 made $3.3bn in 2012 on stock option profits and the vesting of restricted stock. Cash bonuses totalled $16.2m. Overall, GMI's poll of pay and other forms of compensation for 2,259 US CEOs found an average rise of 8.47%, less than the double-digit growth they have enjoyed for the past two years. But the average hides a more complex picture. This year's top earners far outstripped those below them by making huge fortunes cashing in share options as the stock markets bounced back. The report further illustrates the widening gap between CEO pay and that of the average worker. According to the US census bureau, median household income, adjusted for inflation, was $51,017 in 2012, broadly unchanged from 2011. Wages for the average household have fallen about 9% from an inflation-adjusted peak of $56,080 in 1999. The census figures show a sharp recovery for those at the top of the wage scale as those at the bottom continue to see falls. From 2009 to 2012, average real income per family grew modestly by 6.0%, according to a report issued last month by Berkeley University pair Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. However, the gains were very uneven. The top 1% incomes grew by 31.4%, while the bottom 99% incomes grew only by 0.4% from 2009 to 2012. The top 1% captured 95% of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery. The disparity is noticeable even among the 1%, where riches accrue to the very wealthiest at an even faster rate than those below. The average pay package of an S&amp;P 500 chief executive last year was $13.7m, according to GMI. For those in charge of S&amp;P small cap companies, it was $3.5m. The average rise in compensation for CEOs of the Russell 3,000 \u2013 which represents about 98% of all public US companies \u2013 was 8.47%. For the Russell 1,000 \u2013 measuring the top 1,000 companies \u2013 it was 15.47%. Base salaries, bonuses and other forms of compensation were largely unchanged in 2012. The survey found that the outsized pay increases experienced by some CEOs came from the exercise of large blocks of stock options and the vesting of outsized restricted stock grants. \"While stock options are intended to align the interests of senior executives with shareholders, the unintended consequence of these grants is often windfall profits that come from small share-price increases,\" GMI said in its report. \"With option grants numbering in the hundreds of thousands or even millions, CEOs at large companies in particular are able to profit by the millions for any positive gain over the strike price of their options. Furthermore, as Mark Zuckerberg showed when he sold $1bn worth of stock at Facebook's IPO, these paper profits can quickly be converted into cash through stock sales.\" Of the top 10 earners in 2012, all received the majority of their compensation for the year from share schemes. One executive, Gregory Maffei, appeared twice in the top 10. Maffei received total compensation worth $254.8m as CEO of Liberty Media Corporation and another $136.4m as head of sister company Liberty Interactive. Maffei profited more than $250m on the exercise of 3.1m options at Liberty Media Corporation in 2012. As head of Liberty Interactive, Maffei exercised an additional 12.3m options for a profit of more than $132m. Added together, his take from the two Liberty companies comes to more than $391m, third place overall. Ruel said it was evident throughout the list that stock option and restricted stock grants fueled out-sized gains. Zuckerberg's fortune came primarily from the difference between the strike price of his stock options - the price at which he could buy his shares, in his case about six US pennies - and the price of Facebook's stock at the IPO, roughly $38. Apple's Tim Cook made nearly $140m on the vesting of restricted stock in 2012. In 2011 Cook was granted one million restricted stock units as new compensation for assuming the role of Apple CEO. That particular grant of restricted stock will not start to vest until 2016.

      "bodyText": "A hedge fund known for its aggressive investment strategy has become the largest private shareholder in Royal Mail, re-igniting anger over Vince Cable's controversial privatisation of the postal service. The Children's Investment Fund owns a 5.8% stake in the 500-year-old postal service, making it the largest shareholder behind the government, which has a 38% stake. TCI is controlled by publicity-shy Chris Hohn, who pressed for the sale of ABN Amro, which ended in the Dutch bank's disastrous takeover by the Royal Bank of Scotland, and has been dubbed a \"locust\" in Germany for its investment style. TCI's stake in Royal Mail came to light under stock market rules obliging investors to report holdings greater than 5%, and was seized on by government critics who argue that the business secretary failed small investors by selling the shares off to \"big money\" in the City and failing to live up to his promise to sell them to long-term investors. TCI revealed that it owns 58.1m shares, on a day when the shares rose to 499p, slightly down on last week but still 50% higher than the 330p the shares were sold at. Hohn, the Surrey-born chief executive of TCI, is also among the UK's most generous philanthropists and first came to prominence in 2005 after he ousted the chief executive of Deutsche B\u00f6rse, Werner Seifert, ending his bid to take over the London Stock Exchange. Seifert retaliated by branding TCI partners and its US equivalents \"locusts\". The bulk of the controversial hedge fund's stake in Royal Mail is likely to have been bought on the stock market rather than directly from the government, but it may still raise hackles among trade unionists who recently voted for a nationwide 24-hour strike next month. It has also reignited criticism from Labour that Royal Mail was sold on the cheap. Ian Murray, the shadow minister for trade and investment, argued that small investors had been failed by the government's \"fire sale\". \"We have seen small investors losing out while the vast majority of shares sold have gone to big-money investors in the City,\" he said. \"Vince Cable claimed that the sale would prioritise long-term investors but serious questions will be asked on whether this is the case, not least given the huge volume of trades in Royal Mail shares which we have seen in the first days of trading, running into hundreds of millions.\" He added: \"This is on top of real concerns that taxpayers have been left short-changed to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds at a time when families across Britain are facing a cost of living crisis.\" Cable told a committee of MPs earlier this month the government was in \"a position to ensure that we do get the right kind of investor community\". He said: \"We are talking about pension funds and insurance companies that hold the savings of millions of people, and we have been very clear that that is the kind of relationship we want to have, that is long-termism.\" A spokesman at the business department referred to these comments and said the government was not disappointed with a hedge fund owner, adding: \"It is not a matter for us, it is a matter for the company.\" TCI and Royal Mail declined to comment. Hedge funds have been among the city institutions and retail investors scrambling for a slice of Royal Mail, in part because they believe modernisation of the postal service could happen faster than planned. David Buik, a market commentator at Panmure Gordon, described Hohn as an extremely shrewd businessman. \"My guess is that he thinks it is a probably a very good company. I suspect he thinks it is undervalued \u2013 I suspect he has bought his stake in it for that reason.\" Neither will it have escaped his attention that Royal Mail is a plum takeover target, Buik added. \"If things don't work out on an independent basis, it would look very cosy in the portfolio of UPS or Deutsche Post.\" TCI has grown into one of the world's largest hedge funds since its creation in 2003, and currently has $11bn in assets under management. In recent months it has been buying into companies with corporate governance concerns, such as Japan Tobacco and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. Since News Corp was split, TCI now owns a stake in Twentieth Century Fox.",

He said: \"We are talking about pension funds and insurance companies that hold the savings of millions of people, and we have been very clear that that is the kind of relationship we want to have, that is long-termism.\"</p> <p>A spokesman at the business department referred to these comments and said the government was not disappointed with a hedge fund owner, adding: \"It is not a matter for us, it is a matter for the company.\"</p> <p>TCI and Royal Mail declined to comment.</p> <p>Hedge funds have been among the city institutions and retail investors scrambling for a slice of Royal Mail, in part because they believe modernisation of the postal service could happen faster than planned.</p> <p>David Buik, a market commentator at Panmure Gordon, described Hohn as an extremely shrewd businessman. \"My guess is that he thinks it is a probably a very good company. I suspect he thinks it is undervalued \u2013 I suspect he has bought his stake in it for that reason.\" Neither will it have escaped his attention that Royal Mail is a plum takeover target, Buik added.</p> <p>\"If things don't work out on an independent basis, it would look very cosy in the portfolio of UPS or Deutsche Post.\"</p> <p>TCI has grown into one of the world's largest hedge funds since its creation in 2003, and currently has $11bn in assets under management.</p> <p>In recent months it has been buying into companies with corporate governance concerns, such as Japan Tobacco and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.

Coverage of Marks's appearance at parliament starts here, with a closing summary here. In another key development, the Group's current chairman is stepping down. In the financial markets, though, this could be remembered as the day we learned that the US economy was weakening even before the government shutdown. Coverage of the Non-Farm Payroll for September, which failed to his expectations for job creation, starts here.

Charts here Cheers, and goodnight. GW The prospect of many months of full-blown electronic money printing by the Federal Reserve had its usual effect on the stock markets. The FTSE 100 index closed at a five month high of 6695 points, up 41 points or 0.6%, while the German DAX jumped 0.9% to 8947, closer to breaking through the 9,000 mark for the first time. The City and Wall Street have got the message that the Fed is going to keep its foot on the accelerator until the labor markets looks considerably better. The creation of 148,000 new jobs across the US doesn't cut the (American) mustard. US bonds have surged in value, wiping 10 basis points off the interest rate on 10-year Treasury bills (to 2.51% from 2.61% last night). That shows bond traders anticipate a lot more bond-buying by the Fed. Here's Nick Fletcher's closing market report: FTSE jumps to five month high after US jobs, as Reckitt rises on pharma sale hopes This is also interesting, by the FT's Peter Spiegel: The mystery of EU economic study criticising Berlin It's an official report, called \u201cFiscal consolidation and spillovers in the Euro area periphery and core\u201d by a Commission economist. It explains how German made the eurozone crisis worse by implementing fiscal consolidation rather than stimulatory spending. Here's a flavour: The degree of consolidations in Germany and other core countries was in contrast to the financial space these countries had in the crisis\u2026. Yet in the drive to consolidate public finances, government investment has been reduced, with major infrastructure investment plans scrapped and backlogs in deferred maintenance building up. Instead, low interest rates could have been locked-in to finance an increase in public spending, by bringing forward public infrastructure projects which should, even when debt-financed, have a higher rate of return. This holds for Germany but also for other core euro area countries like the Netherlands, Finland and Austria, hit by double-dip recessions and which could benefit from a stimulus in productive spending. This won't shock critics of austerity, but quite unusual to see such criticism in an official report out of Brussels. Nice piece by banking expert Frances Coppola on the US hedge funds that are now in control of Co-op Bank: Here's the conclusion: Sutherland and his fellow Board members will be on a very short leash. They must return the Co-Op Bank to profitability within a very short time - otherwise the hedge funds are likely to turn nasty. They will not hesitate to asset-strip the Co-Op Bank if the management fails to meet the profitability targets that they expect. And as between them they DO have a controlling stake, they can unquestionably do this. Sutherland's statement was made with a gun to his head. The Co-Op Group may appear to be in control of its bank, but in reality it is a puppet. And the puppet masters are sharks. Forgot to mention this earlier, but the Bank of England's newish governor, Mark Carney, has asked management consultants from McKinsey to conduct a review of strategy at the BoE. As my colleague Heather Stewart reports: McKinsey will examine the Bank's working methods under the guidance of the Bank's new chief operating officer, Charlotte Hogg, herself a former employee of the high profile consultancy. Accountants Deloitte will also conduct a value for money review of the Bank's support division, Central Services, which includes such functions as human resources and IT. \"It is incumbent on the Bank, as servants of the British public, to ensure that we are as effective and efficient as we can be,\" said a Bank spokesman. Here's the full story: Mark Carney calls in McKinsey to review Bank of England strategy Carney's influence may be apparent in other areas (or areaz, perhaps) Activist hedge fund TCI's move to become Royal Mail's second largest shareholder show that the privatisation of the postal operator was bungled, the opposition Labour Party has claimed tonight. Ian Murray MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Minister for Trade and Investment, said that The Children's Investment Fund's decision to amass a 5.8% of Royal Mail shows that taxpayers were short-changed. Murray said: David Cameron\u2019s Royal Mail fire sale has seen the vast majority of shares going to big money investors in the City while the taxpayer is left short changed. The Tory-led Government claimed that the sale would prioritise long-term investors but serious questions will be asked on whether this is the case, not least given the huge volume of trades in Royal Mail shares which we have seen in the first days of trading running into hundreds of millions. Thanks to David Cameron, taxpayers have been left short changed to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds at a time when families across Britain are facing a cost of living crisis. Royal Mail shares just closed at 499p, valuing the firm at \u00a34.99bn -- compared to the \u00a33.3bn it was valued at flotation. This values TCI's stake at around \u00a3290m (we don't know what it paid for it). Andrew Tyrie MP, who led the inquisition of former Co-op chief executive Peter Marks this morning, has issued an official comment - and he's pretty scathing about what he heard. Tyrie said that Co-op's Bank's failings were depressingly similar to those typical commercial banks: Being owned by a mutual, the Co-op Bank differed from most of its competitors. But on today\u2019s evidence, its shortcomings did not. A lack of personal accountability at senior levels, ineffective corporate governance and insufficient experience and expertise among those taking the decisions; this has become a familiar story. The Banking Commission made recommendations to try and remedy all of these deficiencies. As I covered this morning, Marks didn't appear to know the Commission's key recommendation, that there should be proper individual accountability for mistakes. Here's our US business and finance editor Heidi Moore on the US jobs report: US unemployment: everything you want to know but are afraid to ask The shutdown is over so the jobs report is back. Here's a handy guide to deciphering what any of those numbers mean. Anger over Ireland's 2014 budget hit the streets of Dublin today. Pensioners gathered outside the parliament building to call for the government to resign over the fiscal cutbacks announced last week. Reuters has the story: Irish pensioners called for the government to resign over cuts to medical and phone subsidies in a protest at parliament on Tuesday, the first significant sign of opposition to this month's austerity budget. Ireland has seen relatively little protest during six years of budget cuts that have put it on the verge of exiting its EU-IMF bailout, but more than 1,000 pensioners who travelled from across the country said they could take no more. The government last week scrapped a free telephone allowance, hiked a tax on medical prescriptions and said it would slash the number of people entitled to free health care. \"The elderly are an easy target, but we've just had enough,\" said Frank Kevins, a 66-year-old retired chef who travelled 300 km (185 miles) from the west of Ireland with a poster that said \"Only tyrants penalise old people\". The crowd called on Prime Minister Enda Kenny to resign and booed when a speaker mentioned the junior coalition Labour Party, which has seen its poll ratings plummet after getting elected on a promise to protect the vulnerable. Kenny's government has hit all the major targets under its \u20ac85bn EU-IMF bailout, but years of austerity have weighed down consumer spending, raising fears the economy will not grow fast enough to cut its debt mountain. \"I already have to choose between paying a bill and buying less food ... It's impossible,\" said Bernard Keane, 64, who has to pay the new prescription levy, an increased property tax and a telephone bill from an already stretched 220 euro a week pension. Northern Ireland's construction industry is finally out of recession, according to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. Our correspondent Henry McDonald has the details. The institute has reported the first rise in building workloads in five years . During the downturn the industry lost 26,000 jobs or around 30 per cent of its workforce in the province. \"We are talking about small improvements from a low base and key challenges remain,\" said the institute's spokesman in Northern Ireland Jim Sammon. \"Finance is tight, private sector activity remains scarce, and public sector demand remains constrained. We urge the Northern Ireland Executive to encourage and nurture a recovery by increasing infrastructure spending,\" he said. But there was also a reality check from shopping giant Asda which has been comparing incomes among shoppers and consumers in Northern Ireland to their counterparts in the UK. Henry explains: Asda's latest income tracker found that families in Northern Ireland had the lowest spending power of all UK regions. After all the bills are paid Northern Ireland households had only \u00a360 of discretionary income left to spend. This compares to the UK average of \u00a3157. Business Research, an economic consultancy, draws up a monthly income tracker for the Asda supermarket chain, examining spending habits and discretionary incomes across the UK.It concluded that discretionary incomes in Northern Ireland were 3.5% lower in September than the same month in 2012. While America's economy struggles, the country's top 10 best paid executives took home at least $100m each, and two received upwards of one billion dollars each. The best remunerated boss was Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder, who cashed in when the social network floated. The figures come from GMI Ratings annual poll of executive compensation:. Zuckerberg's total compensation topped $2.27bn \u2013 more than $6m a day. His base salary was $503,205 but the vast majority of his enormous payday came from exercising 60m Facebook share options when the company went public last year. Here's the story: US CEOs break pay record as top 10 earners take home at least $100m each And here's a list of those lucky Top Ten CEOs Share on Wall Street are romping higher following the disappointing US jobs data,with the S&amp;P 500 hitting yet another record high. The Dow Jones index jumped 100 points at one state, and European markets are also hitting five-year highs. The rally comes as more investors calculate that the Federal Reserve will keep pumping money into the system for some time, following the news that the US labour market was already weakening before the Shutdown struck. I fear we're back into the world where Bad News is Good News, because it forces central banks to maintain ultraloose monetary policy: Joshua Raymond, chief marketing strategist at Cityindex.co.uk, comments: US payrolls came in sharply below market forecasts with only 148,000 jobs created, giving the Federal Reserve some added breathing space before they may be forced into tapering stimulus. Today\u2019s jobs data effectively locks in the idea that we are very unlikely to see the Fed taper stimulus this year as the weaker turn for US data locks in an accommodative monetary policy stance. One thing to keep an eye on will be revisions to Septembers job report as we don\u2019t yet know how much of an effect the partial government shutdown has had on the accuracy of the data compiled. The Royal Mail flotation has taken another twist today, with the news that a leading activist hedge fund has amassed a 5% stake. A regulatory filing from Royal Mail this afternoon showed that The Children's Investment Fund now owns more than 58 million of the Royal Mail's 1bn shares, giving it a 5.8% stake (thus triggering the announcement). This appears to make TCI the biggest private shareholder (the government was left with more than 30% of the stock after the float.) TCI, based in London, is well-known for taking stakes in companies and agitating for change, so Royal Mail's management could face a rough ride. It was founded a decade ago by manager and philanthropist Chris Hohn, who co-founded the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) charity with his wife to help under-privileged children in the developing world. Business secretary Vince Cable had promised that responsible, long-term investors would be favoured in the allocation process. It's not clear how many shares TCI received in the float, and how many it has mopped up since. Shares in Royal Mail have dropped today, down 1% at present to 492p. They floated at 330p. The Co-operative Group's chairman, Len Wardle, is to step down, as the turmoil surrounding the organisation continues to swirl. Co-op Group just announced that Wardle will make his decision official at the next half-yearly meeting of members on 2 November, and depart in May 2014. The news comes a day after US hedge funds forced it to surrender control of its Bank yesterday. In a statement, Wardle said he should be replaced by an independent chairman. On 2 November I intend to give the membership my notice that I will relinquish my Chairmanship in May 2014. In August this year, I informed the Board that it was my intention to step down at the end of my term of office whilst also making clear that I wanted to drive hard the reforms to modernise the Group. During the last year, we have appointed Euan Sutherland as Group CEO and started the changes that I believe will make The Co-operative Group stronger than ever. The Co-operative is at its best when it is reforming and I want this change to continue. I want to persuade our members that The Co-operative Group should now look to an independent chair to lead the business, working side-by-side with the members who represent the movement. I am immensely proud to have led the Group and to have chaired The Co-operative over the last six years. The Group's CEO, Euan Sutherland, commented: Firstly, I want to thank Len for his leadership and commitment to The Co-operative over the last six years. Under his guidance we have made significant progress on beginning the reform which we will announce as planned in May 2014. I look forward to working with colleagues and members to ensure that we return the business to growth over the coming years. As I covered extensively this morning, Sutherland's predecessor was very critical of the Co-op Group's structure while being quizzed by MPs today. Peter Marks said partly blamed the problems at Co-op Bank on the fact the organisation has a toe in too many areas. Wall Street has opened a little higher on the back of the US jobs data, with the Dow Jones up 28 points, or 0.17%, in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are also gaining a little. Back to the UK briefly -- the bosses of Britain's largest energy firms are being hauled before MPs to explain the recent rash of price hikes, after tariffs jumped by upwards of 8%. Big six energy firms to face MPs following price hikes Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe flags up one cheerful note -- the drop in the US jobless rate, to 7.2%, was caused by more people getting jobs rather than simply dropping out of the labour market altogether. Dom writes: September's fall appears to be driven by employment growth, one bright spark in an otherwise lacklustre report. The largest job gains were in construction, wholesale trade, and transportation and warehousing. Employers have now added an average of 185,000 positions each month over the last year as of September, but gains have slowed in recent months. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) has remained high and was little changed in September at 4.1 million. These individuals accounted for 36.9% of the unemployed. The unemployment rates for teenagers (21.4%), black people (12.9%) and Hispanics (9%) also remained high and unchanged. Stock markets in Europe have pushed higher on the back of the disappointing jobs data from America. The FTSE 100 is up 30 points at 6684, a gain of 0.46%, having hit the highest intraday level since the start of August. Germany's DAX is up another 0.8% and heading for yet another record high. The prospect of yet more Fed stimulus is getting traders drooling, even though the real message from today's Non-Farm Payroll is that the US labour market is weak. Barclays also reckons the Fed will keep stimulating for several more months... Stock markets will climb higher by Christmas as the Federal Reserve keeps pumping money into the US economy, predicts Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. Rundle reckons the Fed might not start tapering its bond buying programme until the middle of next year: Jobs generation remains weak, other facets of the US economy are also suffering from weakness \u2013 yesterday\u2019s weaker existing home sales report for example and more importantly, fiscal uncertainty in the US remains. Lawmakers will have to re-address the debt limit and funding for the Treasury early next year; this makes the Fed\u2019s job much harder in terms of an exit plan for QE. At the same time, if the trigger is not pulled by current head Ben Bernanke before he leaves at the end of 2013, it will be the duty of the incoming Fed President who could be Janet Yellen \u2013 an endorser of loose monetary policies [low interest rates and accommodative easing tools], otherwise known as a dove in the market. ...Most likely it will be mid-2014 or late before we see the first tapering shot fired. Risk assets are to remain well supported through to year-end; S&amp;P500 to hit 1810 by end of 2013, FTSE100 to hit 6850. This graph also shows how job creation in America remains subdued: The weak US jobs report shows that the Federal Reserve was quite right last month, when it decided not to start to 'taper' (or slow) its programme of buying $85bn of government bonds and mortgage debt. Economist Justin Wolfers flags up that US job creation is faltering - an average of just 143, 000 new hires were made each month between July and September, compared to 209,000 per month at the end of 2012. David Nicholls, alliance manager at UKForex, agrees that the US labour markets looks too weak for the Fed to start tapering its bond-purchase scheme: Today\u2019s non-farm payroll data (148K vs 182K expected) is another nail in the coffin for tapering anytime this year. The numbers just aren\u2019t supporting an immediate move by the Fed, and the dollar is softening further as a result. It\u2019s also difficult to see that October\u2019s data is going to be any more positive given the recent government shut down. We expect data to continue to support a delayed tapering decision this year \u2013 and that will weigh heavily on the US dollar. Our first take on the Non-Farm Payroll is here: The US unemployment rate remained at the lowest level since 2008 in September, according to figures released on Tuesday that were delayed by the federal government shutdown. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate remained \"little changed\" at 7.2%, with the economy adding 148,000 jobs. But the US economic recovery remains fragile, with employers adding jobs at a slower rate than the previous month. US jobless rate 'little changed' at 7.2% as recovery stays on sluggish pace The price of US Treasury bills is jumping on the news that the US jobs market was weaker than expected in September. This has driven down the interest rate (yield) on 10-year bonds to a three month low. The dollar also took an immediate dive, pushing the pound up almost half a cent to $1.6183. That backs up the idea that the Federal Reserve won't start tapering its QE programme for some months.... The early reaction from analysts and economists is that September's non-farm payroll report means the Fed will keep stimulating the US economy at its current rate until 2014. An increase of just 148,000 new jobs is quite a miss compared to the consensus of 180,000 (some bullish analysts expected to see a &gt;200,000 reading). Experts on Bloomberg TV are agreed that this is a bad jobs report, particularly in the private sector where just 126,000 new jobs were created in September. This is not what the Federal Reserve is looking to see before it starts to ease its $85bn/month quantitative easing programme, one suggests. The US labour force participation rate is unchanged, at 63.2%. Previous US unemployment data has been revised, too. The Bureau of Labour Statistics says 193,000 new jobs were created in August, up from 169,000 new jobs. But July's data has been downgraded, to 89,000 new jobs from 104,000. Breaking: 148,000 new jobs were created in America last month. That's less than expected. The jobless rate is down, though, from 7.3% to 7.2%. City forecasts for non-farm payroll vary considerably, as ever - the consensus is that 180,000 new jobs were created in America last month, leaving the jobless rate unchanged at 7.3%. Right, time for the next order of business - the delayed US jobs data. The Non-Farm payroll for September, showing how many new jobs were created in America last month, is due out any moment (8.30am New York, or 1.30pm BST) It's been delayed by more than two weeks by the US government shutdown, and economists are eager to learn how the labour market was performing before Capitol Hill plunged the country into uncertainty in that row over the US budget and the debt ceiling..... That really was quite a session between Peter Marks and the Treasury committee over Co-op's lurch into crisis (highlights start here). The key points, I think, are: \u2022 His warning that the Co-operative Group was, and is, spread too thinly, which helped to drive Co-op Bank into such difficulties. That is going to fuel fears over the mutual's future, now two US hedge funds have taken control of the Bank via its refinancing. \u2022 The admission that Co-op should never have merged its financial service arm with Britannia Building Society. If he had a crystal ball, he'd not have done it. (why don't board rooms include crystal balls as standard fittings?)... ...and the insistence that the ill-fated deal to buy hundreds of Lloyds branches was not a bad decision. \u2022 Marks' refusal to take full personal responsibility. He tried to pin the blame for the Co-op Bank/Britannia merger on the two chief executives. And while he conceded being the \"driving force\" behind the Lloyds bid, he said former Co-op Bank CEO Neville Richardson had played the main role. \u2022 The declaration that a hedge fund can't be ethical will worry any Co-op Bank customer who is worrying about its future. As Marks put it: Hedge funds exist to maximise profits...to be ethical, you can't do that. This raises the issue of whether Co-op Bank should continue to use the co-operative title, now it's under the control of two US hedge funds. As Marks said \"it's not a Co-op\" any more. And Marks's comments on why it's so hard for a mutual bank to compete also suggest the era is over. \u2022 We still don't know exactly how the Co-op was allowed to continue with the Lloyds branch bid until Spring 2013, despite concerns over its capital position. Marks blamed the PRA regulators for 'moving the goalposts' and forcing the Co-op to seek more capital. \u2022 MPs didn't look convinced. The Treasury committee seemed sceptical on occasions, and incredulous on others, as Marks tried to avoid taking blame. As Brooks Newmark put it: \"It says it on the tin. You were the leader\" . And Andrew Tyrie appeared most unimpressed at the sight of another executive explained how decisions were taken collectively. Where's the individual accountability?... After more than two hours of grilling, Andrew Tyrie releases Peter Marks from the Thatcher Room. It's not been an easy morning for you, or anyone else, Tyrie remarks. But a lot of people have lost money out there, not just bond holders, so it's important that the session took place. Any final words? Marks, who can't have enjoyed the session one little bit (the accusation of selective amnesia was probably the low point), says that he's \"spent his life working for the Co-op\". What has happened is a tragedy for the company, customers, and him personally. However, despite everything, Marks believes the Co-operative Group (whose history dates back to the Rochdale pioneers of the 19th century), still has \"a good future\". Andrew Tyrie is returning to the question of Peter Marks's own role in the Co-op's failures. Didn't you make \"very big mistakes\"? Marks tries to shimmy the question. Taking over Britannia was indeed a mistake, but Project Verde (the aborted bid for Lloyds' branches) wasn't. That deal would have given the Bank the market share it needed, and fixed many of the regulator's worries. He also insists that the Verde project had everyone's support , this wasn't Peter Marks going \"gung ho\". He also defends another scheme, Project Unity, which was designed to allow Co-op Group to sell its products across its various operations. John Thurso MP is asking if \"mutuals\" have a future - was the Co-op's Bank's mutual status responsible for its problems, or was it a straightforward case of bad management? Peter Marks doesn't believe it's mutual status was the cause, except it couldn't raise capital as easily as a PLC (which could tap the equity markets for funds). So is the model viable, Thurso asks? Marks: it's very hard for a mutual to be a \"real, serious competitor\" in the UK banking market, which he dubs a \"high volume, low margin business\", subject to costly regulation and high capital reserve requirements. Brooks Newmark becomes the latest MP to question Peter Marks, and to question his claim that he is not responsible for the blunders that caused Co-op's present problems. He dismisses Marks argument that he was only a non-executive director of Co-op Bank at the time of the Britannia merger, saying he cannot \"absolve responsibility\" for mistakes. Newmark accuses Marks of being in \"complete denial\": Newmark is also homing in on KPMG, who advised Co-op on both the Lloyds branch deal and the takeover of Britannia building society (details here). Did they botch the job and give 'bad advice'? Marks argues that the advice was \"right at the time\", and again cites Britain's economic problems (an excuse which the committee don't appear impressed with) Marks suggests the Co-op should get some credit for walking away from the deal to buy hundreds of branches of Lloyds. We're back on the issue of Co-op's structure, with Peter Marks repeating his earlier warning that the Group is spread over too many areas - from supermarkets to travel via funerals and legal services. If I failed at anything, it was not getting the Group board to heed my warnings, Marks says. Andrew Tyrie pounces. If we look for the documentary evidence of these warnings, will we find it? Probably not, Marks concedes. No evidence of \"your devastating critique\"? Marks suggests not, but is sure his former colleagues will remember.... Can a hedge fund be ethical, asks Pat McFaddon MP, pointing to the fact that two US hedge funds now have control of Co-op Bank. \"No,\" Peter Marks replies. \"Hedge funds exist to maximise profits...to be ethical, you can't do that\". In that case, McFaddon asks, should it really be called the Co-op Bank if it's not the Co-op? Marks says it's difficult for him to answer that, but concedes the point. Peter Marks blames the City regulators for 'moving the goalposts' on capital reserves, triggering the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall at the Bank. He also insists that the Co-operative Group took seriously the warnings from Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England's top regulator, about capital reserves and risk management. Asked about who took the decision to abandon the bid for Lloyds branches, Marks calls it a \"collective decision\" Of the Group or the Bank? Both, Marks replies. Jesse Norman MP asks Marks if he could face criminal charges for acting as a 'shadow executive chairman'. Why? Because Marks says he was a driving force behind the failed bid for Lloyds branches despite not being the Co-op Bank CEO. Marks says not, insisting the Co-op Group board unanimously voted to look at this deal, as did the board of the Bank. Andrew Tyrie, the highly respected chairman of the Treasury committee, is asking a lot of follow-up questions. Not a good sign.... Ruffley then reads out details of an interview given by Marks when he stepped down from the Group this year, about how he had risen from humble roots to the top. How does he feel today? Feeling very sad. Now it's David Ruffley MP's turn. He warns Peter Marks that his \"selective amnesia\" had better stop, and demands better answers about when the former Group boss became aware of Lloyds Banking Group's concerns about its capital weakness Were there really no alarm bells ringing a year ago? Marks insists that it only became clear at the start of this year that there was a capital shortfall (which led to the \u00a31.5bn capital raising exercise, in which Co-op Group will only hold 30% of its Bank). A reminder: the session is being streamed live here. Mark BarnierGarnier MP tells Peter Marks that Lloyds had become aware a year ago that the Co-op Bank was undercapitalised. When did he learn this? Marks says can't remember the details of discussions over capital shortfalls. Garnier is quite surprised. Surely you'd remember when you first learned that your big deal started to crash? Marks replies that the deal wasn't crashing at that stage. Marks also denies shirking responsibility for Co-op Bank's woes, saying he was absolutely prepared to take the blame for other deals that he was fully involved in. The Lloyds bank branch deal doesn't fall into this area, he claims. Andrew Tyrie questions whether 'tragedy' is the right term to use for Co-op' Banks woes -- surely a tragedy is something unavoidable. This mess was quite avoidable. Marks disputes this, and agrees with the suggestion that the Co-op Bank was an \"innocent victim\" of the financial crisis. Marks repeats that the Co-op Bank's slide into the hands of two US hedge funds is a \"tragedy\", but claims it could be a good thing for the wider Group. It will force the Co-operative Group to focus on key areas and not stretch its capital, he suggests, harking back to his earlier warning that the organisation is spread too thinly. Labour MP John Mann savages Peter Marks over the situation at Co-op Bank today, accusing Peter Marks and colleagues of being \"totally out of your depth when trying to grow the Co-op so rapidly.\" That's why two US hedge funds are taking control of the Co-op, right? Marks replies that those two funds are only taking majority control of Co-op Bank, not the wider Group. Marks says he helped to guide the Group through the \"worst recession in living memory\". Did you make disastrous errors, John Mann inquires: Marks say that it's harsh to use the word disastrous, but concedes there were certainly errors. Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie is digging down into the details of who was actually taking the decisions that led to Co-op Bank's slide into trouble. Marks isn't taking individual responsibility for the failed bid for Lloyd's branches, saying that Neville Richardson (the Co-op's Bank's former) boss took most of the key decisions. Tyrie says it looks like another example of \"everyone collectively moving forward together, and no-one actually running it\". He asks Marks if he's read the Banking Standards Commission's report into the sector, and Marks concedes that he hasn't read it thoroughly. What's the Commission's key recommendation? Marks doesn't know. It's that there should be individual responsibility for key decisions, Tyrie replies,. Marks agrees that he was the 'driving force' behind Co-op's bid for the Lloyds branches, calling it a \"great opportunity\" to deliver the scale that Bank needed. But wasn't it a catastrophic misjudgement, asks Jesse Norman MP ? No, Marks says, arguing that Co-op Bank's fundamental problem was a lack of capital. This deal would have brought much-needed capital in. Onto the details of Co-op's Bank's failed bid for the branches being spun off by Lloyds (known as Project Verde) Was Peter Marks aware of political interference with the Verde process? \"Not that I'm aware of,\" he replies. Peter Marks seems reluctant to take too much blame for the Co-op Bank's troubles, pointing out that he wasn't personally regulated by the Financial Services Authority to run a bank. He's also pinned responsibility for the Britannia merger on Neville Richardson, Britannia's chief executive at the time who became head of Co-op Bank, and former Co-operative Financial Services boss David Anderson: The Treasury committee are trying to get a handle on exactly who to blame for Co-op's woes. Marks argues that \"we all have to take some degree of responsibility, including me\". He has concedes that Co-op Bank's \"ethical reputation has been damaged\" by the PPI scandal, in which it is paying out over \u00a3200m in compensation. Co-op Bank was forced into trouble by its take-over of the Britannia Building Society in 2009, Marks agrees. With hindsight, he wouldn't do it again. Former Co-op chief Peter Marks went on to warn that the Co-operative Group is spread too thinly. Marks, who stepped down in May 2013, is being asked by Andrew Tyrie about structural problems at the Group. He says: I think there are areas of governance within the Co-operative that absolutely need to change. So why didn't you change then, Tyrie inquires. Marks replied that he wasn't on the board of the Group. He than warns that the group, which runs supermarkets, pharmaceutical branches, funeral services, insurance and banks, is simply involved in too many different operations. It was, and still is, stretching its capital over too many businesses, Marks added. Over in Westminster, MPs on the Treasury committee are starting to quiz Peter Marks, the former chief executive of the Co-operative Group. Marks is facing questions over the Co-op's ill-fated attempt to buy hundreds of bank branches from Lloyds. That bid was scuppered by the discovery of a capital shortfall in Co-op Bank, which eventually led yesterday to the Group losing majority control of its Bank after a battle with US hedge funds. My colleague Jill Treanor is there, and reports: The session is being streamed live here - although it has been a little flakey... This chart, from today's UK public finances, shows how tax receipts rose 7% year-on-year in September, after a weaker August: And this graph shows how cumulative borrowing since April is lower than a year ago: Just in: the UK borrowed less than expected in September, thanks to an increase in tax revenues. Britain's Public Sector Net Borrowing, excluding the cost of financial interventions, came in at \u00a311.072bn, beating forecasts of \u00a311.2bn and better than last year's \u00a312.067bn. The Office for National Statistics reported that central government accrued current receipts rose to \u00a344.8bn, up \u00a32.9 billion or 7.0% compared with September 2012. The ONS explains, though that the monthly data needs treating with caution: The higher receipts in September 2013 (compared with September 2012) came from taxes on production and taxes on income and wealth. However, the relatively large increases seen in taxes on income and wealth have been affected by monthly volatility. These are related to timing effects which offset the falls seen in August. The ONS also reported that Britain's 'underlying' Public Sector Net Borrowing since the start of April has now reached \u00a356.7bn, 9.4% lower than a year ago. By other measures, though, borrowing is actually up this year (due to various one-off factors like putting the Royal Mail pension fund onto the public books last year) I'll post some charts now.... Charlie Bean, one of the Bank of England's deputy governors, has urged Europe to crack on and implement banking reform. In a wide-ranging speech to the Society of Business Economists, Bean said it was important that Europe used the window created by Mario Draghi, who he credited with saving the euro from break-up. Bean said: The euro area is no longer in existential crisis, in part as a result of the willingness of the European Central Bank (ECB) to take redenomination risk off the table through its Outright Monetary Transactions programme. The countries of the euro-area periphery have also made progress in restoring competitiveness and rebalancing the composition of demand, though there is still quite a way to go. Member states are working towards the creation of a functional banking union, which has the potential to break the link between sovereigns and banks. And in preparation for becoming the euro-area banking supervisor, the ECB is planning a rigorous review of the quality of banks\u2019 assets, to be followed by a set of stress tests and, if necessary, recapitalisation. Provided these carry credibility with the market, this could do much to restore confidence in the euro-area banking system. Bean also said the UK recovery was 'gaining traction' (we get new GDP data on Friday), and also defended the BoE's forward guidance (which means interest rates shouldn't rise until the labour market improves). Over in Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker's long grip on power could finally be slipping. Although Juncker's party won the most support in Sunday's elections, it lost three seats - dropping to just 23 of the 60 seats in parliament. Opposition parties are beginning coalition talks, as Reuters reports this morning: Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker was facing the end of a 19-year run in power on Tuesday after the centre-right Democratic Party (DP) said it would begin coalition talks with would-be partners, the Socialists and the Greens. Juncker's Christian Social People's Party (CSV) has led governments in the tiny state between France, Germany and Belgium for all but five years since World War Two, but lost three seats in an election on Sunday to leave it with just 23 in the 60-seat parliament. That was the party's worst showing since 1999. The Democratic Party and the Socialists both won 13 seats and the Greens six. \"We will contact them to come together tomorrow to see if there is a possibility to work together in the coming five years,\" DP leader Xavier Bettel told RTL television. \"It's a realistic option.\" Juncker was a familiar face in the dark days of the eurozone crisis, as leader of the Eurogroup of finance ministers (he stepped down at the end of 2012). Now, his position as Luxembourg's PM could be at risk.... Heads-up. Greek MPs will vote today on whether to withdraw funding from parties whose members face serious criminal charges \u2013 the latest step in the clampdown against the extremist Golden Dawn group. Kathimerini explains: Greece's conservative-led government and leftist opposition SYRIZA have reached a common position, with the leftist party confirming last week that it will vote in favor of the bill, which has been drafted by Interior Minister Yiannis Michelakis after extensive consultation with the Parliament's opposition parties. Last week MPs voted by an overwhelming majority to lift the immunity of six Golden Dawn MPs, opening the way for a broadening of a criminal investigation into the ultra-right party, which is the real target of the bill being voted on on Tuesday. Economist Shaun Richards fears Ofgem's clampdown on energy tariffs is too late. Downbeat news from Lufthansa has sent the German airline's shares down almost 4% this morning. In an unscheduled update, Lufthansa warned that restructuring costs will wipe \u20ac200m off operating profits this year, with various 'project' costs costing another \u20ac100m. More here. CEO Christoph Franz has been implementing a radical shake-up of the company, cutting thousands of jobs and shifting more traffic to its budget offering, Germanwings. Analysts had expected the company to deliver operating profits of around \u00a3917m -- it now says it'll be between \u20ac600m and \u20ac700m. A pretty mixed start to European stock market trading, with the FTSE 100 creeping higher (up 0.1%) the German DAX flat, and the French CAC down 0.2%. The excuse is that traders are waiting for those US jobs numbers at 1.30pm BST: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets agrees, saying: US jobs will be the driver for a break one way of the other. Or much ado about nothing? Asian markets had also been mixed overnight, although Australia's A&amp;P/ASX 200 did gain another 0.4% to a new five-year high. After taking quite a mauling in recent weeks over its handling of the energy market, watchdog Ofgem is showing its teeth in two ways this morning. It has told Scottish Power to repay \u00a38.5m to customers for breaking mis-selling rules, after finding that the agents who knocked on doors and 'phoned households to suggest they change energy supplier had misled customers. Ofgem said the penalty would \"directly benefit vulnerable consumers and compensate consumers that were misled\" by Scottish Power (which ended doorstep visits in 2011). In a statement, senior partner Sarah Harrison declared: Today's announcement is a clear signal to energy suppliers of the consequences of breaching licence obligations and of the importance of taking action to put things right for consumers when they go wrong. Ofgem has also announced that new rules on energy prices come into effect today, as a time when customers are reeling from large hikes in tariffs. Details are here. The key points: \u2022 it will prevent firms from raising the price of 'fixed-term deals' (sounds fair - the clue is in the name, after all). \u2022 Firms also won't be allowed to simply roll a customer over onto a new fixed-term contract when their existing one ends. \u2022 \"Simpler\" tariffs will come in from December, with customers also getting \"clearer information\" in March 2014. A case of better late than never? There's also nothing here to prevent a company hitting consumers with the hefty price hikes seen in recent days. As Ofgem boss Andrew Wright explains, the idea is to help customers 'vote with their feet', to keep the industry playing fair: In an era of rising prices it is vital that competition works as effectively as possible. Our reforms seek to give consumers the tools they need to find the best energy deal for them and to ensure that suppliers have to treat them fairly. The oil price has dropped again overnight, with a barrel of US crude dropping to $98.79 - its lowest level since early July. US crude dropped through the $100 mark yesterday, as data showed an rise in oil inventory levels. Traders are also calculating that the economic damage cause by the US shutdown will mean less demand. Could be good news for motorists, if it feeds through to the pumps... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial market, the global economy, the eurozone and the business world. Investors and economists are waiting with eager anticipation for America's unemployment data, eighteen days late thanks to the disruption caused by the US government shutdown shutdown. After a Beckettian wait, we finally find out at 1.30pm BST how many jobs were created across the US last month -- a key measure of the health of the world's largest economy at the start of autumn. Forecasts for the Non-Farm Payroll vary widely (as ever). The consensus is that 180,000 new job were created last month -- there could be some lively action if this prediction is way off beam. Under normal circumstances, the jobs data would indicate if the Federal Reserve is close to turning down the tap on its $85bn/month stimulus package. But the disruption caused by America's government shutdown has thrown that up into the air. What else is afoot? Well, UK public finances are released at 9.30am - showing how much Britain borrowed to balance the books in September. While in Parliament from 10am, MPs will be questioning the former boss of The Co-operative Group, Peter Marks, a day after the company surrendered control of its Bank to its bondholders (front page news in today's paper) Eurozone-wise, we'll be watching Greece (where the Troika of lenders return next week), Portugal (whose finance minister ruled out a second bailout yesterday), and Italy (where opposition to the 2014 budget was growing). I'll be tracking the main events through the day - let me know what I've missed!",

It explains how German made the eurozone crisis worse by implementing fiscal consolidation rather than stimulatory spending.</p> <p>Here's a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The degree of consolidations in Germany and other core countries was in contrast to the financial space these countries had in the crisis\u2026.</p> <p>Yet in the drive to consolidate public finances, government investment has been reduced, with major infrastructure investment plans scrapped and backlogs in deferred maintenance building up. Instead, low interest rates could have been locked-in to finance an increase in public spending, by bringing forward public infrastructure projects which should, even when debt-financed, have a higher rate of return.</p> <p>This holds for Germany but also for other core euro area countries like the Netherlands, Finland and Austria, hit by double-dip recessions and which could benefit from a stimulus in productive spending.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>This won't shock critics of austerity, but quite unusual to see such criticism in an official report out of Brussels.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ecfin/statuses/392690537523732480\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Economic paper: Fiscal consolidations and spillovers in the Euro area periphery and core <a href=\"http://t.co/eMQofg4zXy\">http://t.co/eMQofg4zXy</a></p>&mdash; DG ECFIN (@ecfin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecfin/statuses/392690537523732480\">October 22, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5266aeade4b0c53fe22c1e5f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-22T17:05:11.126Z\">6.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://coppolacomment.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/the-lure-of-gold-deceit-of-silver.html\">Nice piece by banking expert Frances Coppola</a> on the US hedge funds that are now in control of Co-op Bank:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Frances_Coppola/statuses/392696481440100352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>&quot;Co-Op Group may appear to be in control of its bank, but in reality it is a puppet &amp; the puppet masters are sharks&quot; <a href=\"http://t.co/130a4HdxCB\">http://t.co/130a4HdxCB</a></p>&mdash; Frances Coppola (@Frances_Coppola) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Frances_Coppola/statuses/392696481440100352\">October 22, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Here's the conclusion:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sutherland and his fellow Board members will be on a very short leash.

      "bodyText": "The United States's 10 highest paid chief executives took home a combined $4.7bn in compensation in 2012, and none earned less than $100m \u2013 a first for the annual poll by GMI Ratings, a corporate governance research group. Two executives made over a billion dollars \u2013 another first. All told, US CEOs had a bumper year selling stock, making $3.3bn on stock option profits and the vesting of restricted stock. 1. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook \u2013 total compensation $2.27bn The social network king received a base salary of $503,205 in 2012 and $1.2m in perks, including use of the company aircraft and security. But it was the sale of Facebook that made him his fortune. Zuckerberg profited nearly $2.3bn on his share options when the company went public. 2. Richard Kinder, Kinder Morgan \u2013 $1.16bn The billionaire energy executive received just $1 in wages in 2012 \u2013 but more than $1.1bn in restricted stock profits. Kinder Morgan's share price has been falling this year on reports that the company has minimised pipeline repairs in order to maximise returns to shareholders \u2013 a characterization the company disputes. 3. Mel Karmazin, Sirius XM Radio - $255.3m The veteran radio executive stepped down from running Sirius last December, and received a $9.5m bonus. His was the largest bonus in the 10 top-paid CEOs. But, again, it was his share options that handed him most of his compensation \u2013 120m of them worth more than $244m. 4. Gregory Maffei, Liberty Media \u2013 $254.8m Strike one for Maffei, who appears twice in this list. The Liberty Media boss received a salary of $875,109, a $2.23m cash bonus and $252,323 in perks. He profited more than $250m on the exercise of 3.1m options at Liberty Media Corporation in 2012, a little over half the grant of the nearly 6m options he received in 2009. 5. Tim Cook, Apple \u2013 $143.8m Cook made nearly $140m in restricted stock profits in 2012 on grants that date back to 2008 and 2010, before he took over as CEO. In August 2011, when he took over from Steve Jobs, Cook was granted 1m restricted stock units that start paying out in 2016. 6.

Gregory Maffei, Liberty Interactive \u2013 $136.4m With his Interactive hat on, Maffei exercised an additional 12.3m options for a profit of more than $132m. Added together his take from the two Liberty companies comes to more than $391m, third place overall. 8.

Marks's appearance came as the Co-op Group's chairman, Len Wardle, announced that he is quitting to clear the way for a successor to be appointed from outside the mutual movement.</p> <p>The decision by Len Wardle to step aside from next May was said to not be related to Marks' appearance before MPs but is significant, signalling a shift from the traditional boardroom composition of the Co-op and the potential for cultural change. The board is made up of 20 members of the movement and Wardle, a former university fellow, has been chairman since 2007.</p> <p>Mark's appearance before MPs came 24 hours after the Co-op Group had to admit it was ceding control of its bank \u2013 for which Marks had once harboured huge ambitions - to hedge funds.

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group promised a radical overhaul of its boardroom on Tuesday just hours after the former boss of the grocery and funeral care business deflected responsibility for the crisis at its bank which has fallen under the control of hedge funds. Peter Marks was accused of \"selective amnesia\", being \"gung-ho\", \"out of his depth\", and in \"complete denial\" during a heated appearance before the Treasury select committee of MPs at the former boss of the UK's largest mutual, described the fate of the bank as a \"tragedy\". Marks's appearance came as the Co-op Group's chairman, Len Wardle, announced that he is quitting to clear the way for a successor to be appointed from outside the mutual movement. The decision by Len Wardle to step aside from next May was said to not be related to Marks' appearance before MPs but is significant, signalling a shift from the traditional boardroom composition of the Co-op and the potential for cultural change. The board is made up of 20 members of the movement and Wardle, a former university fellow, has been chairman since 2007. Mark's appearance before MPs came 24 hours after the Co-op Group had to admit it was ceding control of its bank \u2013 for which Marks had once harboured huge ambitions - to hedge funds. The Co-op -\u2013 which spans funeral homes, grocers and pharmacies - will be left with just 30% ownership after the deal with hedge funds to plug a \u00a31.5bn capital gap in the bank. Marks, who left in May after 45 years, was greeted with incredulity by MPs as he repeatedly refused to take personal responsibility for the bank's problems. He said Co-op was not \"Peter Marks plc\" or a \"dictatorship\" and described how his job was not like running a plc as he did not have a seat on the Co-op Group board and could not have changed the way the mutual, founded in 1844, was run. In a blow to his successors, he cast doubt upon their assertions that Co-op bank can maintain its ethical stance despite the involvement of hedge funds. \"It's not a co-op is it?,\" he said \"Hedge funds are there to maximise profit, that's what their sole purpose in life is. To be truly ethical you cannot do that,\" Marks told Labour MP Pat McFadden. Marks said the intervention of the US hedge funds \u2013 Silver Point and Aurelius \u2013 could be a \"good thing\" for the wider Co-op Group and that he warned the Co-op Group board that they \"were stretching their capital and still do\". \"How many businesses try to be major bank, major pharmacy, major food retailer, major funeral director?\" he said. MPs grew frustrated as his reluctance to take responsibility for the bank's merger with Britannia Building Society in 2008 \u2013now blamed for many of the losses \u2013 and the aborted attempt to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group which collapsed in April. \"A lack of personal accountability at senior levels, ineffective corporate governance and insufficient experience and expertise among those taking the decisions; this has become a familiar story,\" said Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the committee, which will take evidence next week from former bank boss Barry Tootell. Marks said the Britannia deal had been overseen by David Anderson, who ran the Co-op bank at the time and the Britannia boss Neville Richardson, who ran the enlarged entity before leaving in 2011. He stressed he was only a non-executive director on the bank's board. \"We do all have to take some responsibility but I was not approved by the Financial Services Authority to run a bank.\" Marks said work by KPMG had been relied upon to agree the Britannia deal. \"I can't take responsibility for something I wasn't in full control of, which was the bank.

But still Marks frustrated MPs by refusing to take personal responsibility and was accused of \"selective amensia\" when he failed to remember a warning about Co-op's capital by Lloyds in December 2012 \u2013 four months before the deal fell apart. At the time Marks blamed the economy for the failed deal \u2013 the capital hole was exposed two months later \u2013 and told MPs that the bank was a \"victim\" of the financial services crash. Asked whether there had been political interference to do the Verde deal \u2013 as has been asserted by failed bidders for the branches \u2013 Marks replied: \"Not that I'm aware of.\"",

Inside the M25 we see a quite robust economy. Outside of the M25 it's much more of a mixed picture and too early to say whether we have seen macro economic improvement.\"</p> <p>Premier Inn sales grew by 18.4% in London, as it increased the number of rooms available and as record numbers of foreigners flocked to the capital in the wake of a successful 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>Twelve new hotels were opened during the first half, taking the total to 660 in the UK, while Premier Inn's like-for-like sales rose by 3.3%.</p> <p>Harrison said there were still \"substantial growth opportunities\" for Costa in the UK.</p> <p>\"The coffee shop category continues to grow in the UK and Costa is the leader in that market,\" he said.</p> <p>Whitbread is also expanding the Costa brand overseas, and has almost 300 shops in China.</p> <p>It is targeting France for expansion, with the first Costa Coffee shop opening in Paris last week. A further five shops are planned in the French capital by the end of the full year.</p> <p>\"If that is a success we will open more in Paris, and if that is a success we will open more in France. We want to prove that one thing works before moving onto the next one,\" Harrison said.</p> <p>Whitbread opened 153 new Costa shops in the first half, 86 of which were in the UK, taking the total to 2,680 worldwide.</p> <p>Harrison said that as UK inflation continued to outpace wage growth, the impact was still being felt in its restaurants business, which includes the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre brands.

The owner of Costa Coffee and the Premier Inn hotel chain said pre-tax profit rose 12.6% to \u00a3216.1m while revenue rose 12.4% to \u00a31.14bn in the six months to 29 August. Andy Harrison, the chief executive, said the company's two \"growth engines\" performed well, with Costa profits rising 20% to \u00a343.5m and Whitbread's hotels and restaurants arm \u2013 which includes Premier Inn \u2013 seeing a near-8% rise in profits to \u00a3195.7m. He said: \"The London economy continues to grow as it has done for the last year or so. Inside the M25 we see a quite robust economy. Outside of the M25 it's much more of a mixed picture and too early to say whether we have seen macro economic improvement.\" Premier Inn sales grew by 18.4% in London, as it increased the number of rooms available and as record numbers of foreigners flocked to the capital in the wake of a successful 2012 Olympics. Twelve new hotels were opened during the first half, taking the total to 660 in the UK, while Premier Inn's like-for-like sales rose by 3.3%. Harrison said there were still \"substantial growth opportunities\" for Costa in the UK. \"The coffee shop category continues to grow in the UK and Costa is the leader in that market,\" he said. Whitbread is also expanding the Costa brand overseas, and has almost 300 shops in China. It is targeting France for expansion, with the first Costa Coffee shop opening in Paris last week. A further five shops are planned in the French capital by the end of the full year. \"If that is a success we will open more in Paris, and if that is a success we will open more in France. We want to prove that one thing works before moving onto the next one,\" Harrison said. Whitbread opened 153 new Costa shops in the first half, 86 of which were in the UK, taking the total to 2,680 worldwide. Harrison said that as UK inflation continued to outpace wage growth, the impact was still being felt in its restaurants business, which includes the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre brands. Total revenue was up 2.9% at \u00a3269.9m but like-for-like sales were flat. The group employs 40,000 people and Harrison said about 3,000 jobs would be created in the UK this year, and a total of 10,000 over the next three years. He said Whitbread was in line to meet all its targets, and the board recommended an interim dividend of 21.8p a share, up 11.8%. Following the publication of Whitbread's first half results, Deutsche Bank analysts said there was \"very little to get concerned about\".",

    "webTitle": "Public borrowing figures show George Osborne on track to meet target", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Chancellor George Osborne is on track to meet his budget goal for this year, economists said on Tuesday after the latest public finance figures suggested a quickening economic recovery was boosting government coffers. Public borrowing fell slightly more than expected in September as tax revenues picked up against a backdrop of upbeat business surveys and rising housing market activity, the data from the Office for National Statistics showed. The ONS said the government's preferred measure of public borrowing, which strips out some of the effects of its bank bailouts, showed a deficit of \u00a311.1bn last month. That was down from \u00a312.1bn a year earlier, \u00a313.2bn in August and slightly under the consensus forecast for \u00a311.2bn in a Reuters poll of economists. For the six months of the fiscal year so far borrowing has reached \u00a356.7bn, putting Osborne on track to meet or beat his target for the year for borrowing of no more than \u00a3120bn. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the chancellor was likely to \"markedly beat\" his target. \"At the halfway stage of fiscal 2013-14, the deficit is clearly below the targeted rate, and it seems likely that improved economic activity will increasingly feed through to help the public finances,\" he added. The Treasury welcomed the latest public finance figures, which put the deficit at this halfway point down almost 10% on the same stage a year ago. A spokesman said: \"Borrowing is down this month compared to last year and for the year-to-date. The economy is turning a corner, but there is a long way to go and the government is sticking to the economic plan that has already cut the deficit by a third and enabled the private sector to create over 1.4m new jobs.\" Economists said a 7% annual rise in tax revenues partly reflected the pickup in the property market, which some critics say has been dangerously over-inflated by the government's Help-to-Buy housing finance scheme. Chris Williamson, economist at data group Markit, said: \"Higher revenues from stamp duty, reflecting the recent property market upturn, buoyed revenues, as did higher VAT receipts as consumer spending continued to rise. \"Strong economic growth is likely to persist in coming months, boosting the government's tax-take further, especially from corporation tax, which should more than keep the deficit on target. A figure of \u00a3105bn for the year is currently looking more likely than the government's \u00a3120bn target, which was set at a time when the economy was showing signs of renewed weakness, in contrast to today's picture of robust expansion.\" But the Labour party said that the government was not meeting its longer-term targets. Chris Leslie MP, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Despite last month's welcome fall, the government's deficit plan continues to be way off track. Three years of flatlining growth and falling living standards mean George Osborne is set to break his promise to balance the books by 2015. He's forecast to borrow over \u00a3200bn more than planned simply to pay for the costs of his economic failure.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Scottish Power has been ordered to pay out \u00a38.5m by the energy regulator after customers were misled by the company's doorstep and telesales agents. The energy provider apologised \"unreservedly\" after Ofgem found adequate processes were not in place to train and monitor staff, which resulted in inaccurate information on annual charges, consumption calculations and tariffs. Ofgem senior partner Sarah Harrison said the fine sent \"a clear signal to energy suppliers\" and it was time for them to \"rebuild consumer trust\". Scottish Power has put aside \u00a31m to compensate customers who lost money because of the failings. The company said it would be writing to 336,000 customers potentially affected but that internal estimates suggest around 50,000 will be entitled to a payout. Scottish Power will pay out between \u00a35 and \u00a330 per service, which includes gas, electricity, or dual fuel provision. An additional \u00a37.5m will be paid to more than 140,000 vulnerable customers who will receive payments of around \u00a350 by December. Ofgem found that marketing obligations were breached between October 2009 and January 2012, but found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers. SSE was fined \u00a310.5m in April for \"prolonged and extensive\" sales practice failures. Neil Clitheroe, Scottish Power's energy retail and generation chief executive, said: \"We accept Ofgem's findings and we apologise unreservedly to those customers affected. \"This arose as a result of new regulations which were introduced in 2009. I am sorry to say that we didn't implement these properly at that time.\" Ofgem said the size of the penalty reflected the impact on customers and Scottish Power's willingness to review and correct its processes. \"Had this not been the case the company would have faced a higher penalty,\" it said. Scottish Power stopped doorstep selling in 2011, and introduced independent checks on the conduct of telephone agents in all new sales. The company is one of the UK's Big Six energy providers, three of which have announced a sharp rise in prices over recent weeks, inciting anger from consumer groups and politicians. Scottish Power has yet to announce a rise in tariffs, despite the decision to do so by SSE, British Gas and, most recently, npower. Scottish Power would not be drawn on whether it was poised to announce an increase. \"It is constantly under review but we don't speculate on prices,\" he said. Ofgem said separately that tougher rules taking effect on Tuesday would ban energy companies from increasing prices on fixed-term tariffs. Companies will also be banned from automatically rolling householders on to another fixed term offer when their current one ends. Andrew Wright, Ofgem's chief executive, said: \"Ofgem is resetting the energy market in consumers' favour to make it simpler, clear and fairer. In an era of rising prices it is vital that competition works as effectively as possible. \"Ofgem is going to make it easier for consumers to 'vote with their feet' and for new suppliers to enter the market and take on the Big Six.\" \u2022 Scottish Power has established a \u00a31m compensation fund.

His private equity fund Terra Firma plans to sell at least 30% of its stake in the company, which runs 147 power plants across the UK. But Hands, who is under pressure to show good returns after his disastrous debt-driven buyout of EMI, is only the latest to join the stock market rush. Here are four to watch:</p> <h2><strong>Just Retirement</strong></h2> <p>The biggest provider of so-called \"death bonds\" is set to return to the stock market after a four-year absence. Private-equity firm Permira plans to sell up to 30% of its stake in the \u00a31.4bn-valued company, which sells annuities for people with lower-than-average life expectancies.</p> <h2><strong>Zoopla</strong></h2> <p>The country's second largest property website is considering a stock listing, which could see it valued at \u00a31.3bn. The lucrative flotation of estate agents Countrywide and Foxtons have shown investors' keen interest in companies linked to the housing market.</p> <h2><strong>Lloyds Bank</strong></h2> <p>Buoyed by huge demand for Royal Mail shares, the government is now looking at selling the taxpayer's remaining 32.7% stake to ordinary investors. The government sold 6% of Lloyds shares to major investors last month at 75p a share. But a sale of the taxpayer's 81% stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland is unlikely before 2015, with a decision over creating a 'bad bank' for its problem loans still pending.</p> <h2><strong>Urenco</strong></h2> <p>The uranium-enrichment company Urenco is one of the next state-owned companies up for sale. The government is keen to offload the taxpayer's one third share of Urenco, but the deal must be approved by its other owners, the Dutch government and German utility companies RWE and E.ON. An IPO is one option being considered, but is not guaranteed.</p>",
