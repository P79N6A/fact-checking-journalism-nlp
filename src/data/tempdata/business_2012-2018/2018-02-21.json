      "bodyText": "India\u2019s customs department has revived allegations of a US$600m financial fraud against the Adani Group, challenging an order clearing the mining giant last year as \u201cerroneous, illegal and improper\u201d. Adani has been fighting allegations for the past four years that it used a shell company in Dubai to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars from the company\u2019s books into Adani family tax havens overseas. The Indian conglomerate is preparing to build one of the world\u2019s largest coal mines in Australia and has had to pass several Australian state and federal government probity tests to secure licences to mine. In August last year the Guardian published extensive details of the financial fraud allegations collected by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), India\u2019s customs intelligence agency. Shortly after the publication of the evidence, an Indian official appointed to review the case dismissed the accusations. India\u2019s customs department is now appealing against that judgment, arguing the order clearing Adani was biased towards the company and poorly reasoned, according to a submission obtained by the Indian Express. \u201c[It] suffers from several contradictions which indicate either total non-application of mind or recklessness in passing of the order,\u201d the customs department told the customs, excise and service tax appellate tribunal. According to three sets of Indian customs intelligence documents from 2014, Adani was accused of inflating the cost of electricity equipment for power projects in Maharashtra and Rajasthan states using fraudulent invoices. In some instances it was said to have paid a company controlled by an Adani family member 13 times the cost price for the equipment. The extra money allegedly paid by the company was channelled into offshore bank accounts linked to the Adani family, and out of the reach of Indian regulators or tax authorities, according to the DRI. Adani has consistently denied the accusations. The Indian official appointed to assess the case, KVS Singh, said he believed the transactions were all conducted at arm\u2019s length and in line with corporate best practice. The customs department strongly criticised Singh\u2019s order in its submission. \u201cThe manner in which the adjudicating authority has gone on to describe an otherwise dubious contract process in glowing terms as transparent, independent and good corporate governance practice \u2026 only points at eagerness and bias on the part of the adjudicating authority to justify overvaluation, ignoring facts to the contrary,\u201d it said. The starting date for hearings in the case is yet to be decided. Adani has also been named in an ongoing public-interest lawsuit filed in the Indian supreme court calling for an independent investigation into the fraud accusations and others levelled against Indian energy companies. Indian opposition groups have said if the allegations are true the fraud could have pushed up power prices for local consumers. Adani\u2019s Australian subsidiary is currently trying to raise funds to build the mine and overcome final regulatory hurdles. It recently abandoned a bid for a US$700m government loan to construct a rail line to service the mine after Queensland\u2019s Labor party indicated it would veto the bid. Adani has been contacted for comment. It told the Indian Express that Singh\u2019s original decision \u201cdemonstrates that we have complied with the applicable laws and the transactions are conducted within the framework of law\u201d. \u201cSince the matter is currently sub judice before the Honourable Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai, we cannot offer any detailed explanation at this point of time,\u201d it said.",

    "webTitle": "It would be useful to know what Corbyn really thinks of Lloyds | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s profits are back at pre-crisis level, there\u2019s a new, digital-heavy three-year plan and enough surplus cash to spend \u00a31bn buying back shares. Very good, but the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, has a more interesting boast. Lloyds, he said, is \u201ccompletely aligned\u201d with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s vision that banks should serve the \u201creal economy\u201d. You can see what Horta-Os\u00f3rio means, of course. Since the crisis, Lloyds has jettisoned almost all its overseas operations and presents itself these days as a patriotic servant of \u201cthe people, businesses and communities in the UK\u201d. It parades its flattering statistics at every opportunity: \u00a347bn lent to first-time buyers in the last four years, support for 440,000 startups and the No 1 spot among UK corporate taxpayers. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, lest we forget, has become extremely rich in the process: last year\u2019s \u00a36.4m pay packet is absurd and won\u2019t be cheered by politicians of any stripe. Meanwhile, the group\u2019s behaviour in investigating the fraud at HBOS Reading may have been seriously poor \u2013 the regulator\u2019s view is keenly awaited. But, those qualifications aside, what does the Labour leader make of Lloyds? Is it his kind of bank, or one that he\u2019d prefer to break up? It would be useful to know because Corbyn, in his speech to the EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 trade body, on Tuesday painted the financial landscape with such a broad brush that it was impossible to guess what policies are being contemplated. \u201cBanks should be helping the real economy, not suffocating it,\u201d he said. And later: \u201cWe need a fundamental rethink of whom finance should serve and how it should be regulated.\u201d What does that mean in practice? Was Corbyn merely bemoaning (fairly) some of the socially useless activities of investment banks? Or was he saying that ring-fencing and fatter capital ratios \u2013 the post-crisis reforms of which Lloyds is the poster child \u2013 are inadequate? Horta-Os\u00f3rio has laid down a good challenge. The UK\u2019s biggest bank claims it is putting Corbyn\u2019s view of banking into action. Does the Labour leader agree? A clear answer would be more revealing than a speech that made big claims about the sins of modern finance but didn\u2019t name the culprits. Does he view Lloyds as part of the problem or the solution? AA on the road to nowhere? The AA, after a 28% fall in its share price, is a company worth \u00a3500m towing a \u00a32.7bn caravan of debt. This lop-sided arrangement is the legacy of too many years under private equity ownership (CVC and Permira, take a bow) and the fund managers who foolishly agreed to provide an exit via flotation in 2014. The share price then was 250p v 84p today, offering a vivid illustration of why the AA should never have been allowed to list with this capital structure. Whistling cheerfully, the chief executive, Simon Breakwell, reckons the heavy debt load won\u2019t impede his plans to reinvigorate the group. The covenants are supposedly light, the average cost of debt is 4.5% and the risk of default is described as \u201cvery low\u201d because, even after a hefty profits warning, top-line trading profits are forecast to be \u00a3340m-ish this year. Well, maybe, but it still feels early to be predicting a return to profit growth next year. In attempting to get bigger in car insurance and to sell policies to non-members for the first time, the AA is pitching itself further into a highly competitive market. The other half of the plan is called \u201cconnected car\u201d and involves selling technology devices that detect faults with an engine. Maybe breakdown prevention, as opposed to assistance, really is the future. But since the gadgets have been fitted to only 5,000 cars so far it\u2019s impossible to tell whether this is the advertised gamechanger. Suffering shareholders do know, however, that the AA has been pressing the growth accelerator for years and getting little response. A total of 3.39 million members is a decent base, but the figure is 100,000 lower than three years ago. The dividend is being cut from 9p a share to 2p until further notice, demonstrating that bond holders are in the driving seat. The token payment seems to be a peace offering to income funds, including the one run by poor old Neil Woodford, who was there at the AA\u2019s float and whose shocking run goes on. No fancy technology is required to discern the problem in this case: don\u2019t buy shares in simple companies that have been overly complicated by financial engineers.",

Very good, but the chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, has a more interesting boast. Lloyds, he said, is \u201ccompletely aligned\u201d with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s vision that banks should serve the \u201creal economy\u201d.</p> <p>You can see what Horta-Os\u00f3rio means, of course. Since the crisis, Lloyds has jettisoned almost all its overseas operations and presents itself these days as a patriotic servant of \u201cthe people, businesses and communities in the UK\u201d. It parades its flattering statistics at every opportunity: \u00a347bn lent to first-time buyers in the last four years, support for 440,000 startups and the No 1 spot among UK corporate taxpayers.</p> <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio, lest we forget, has become extremely rich in the process: last year\u2019s \u00a36.4m pay packet is absurd and won\u2019t be cheered by politicians of any stripe.

And later: \u201cWe need a fundamental rethink of whom finance should serve and how it should be regulated.\u201d</p> <p>What does that mean in practice? Was Corbyn merely bemoaning (fairly) some of the socially useless activities of investment banks? Or was he saying that ring-fencing and fatter capital ratios \u2013 the post-crisis reforms of which Lloyds is the poster child \u2013 are inadequate?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio has laid down a good challenge.

The Treasury committee approved the appointment of Charles Randell, a former City lawyer whose firm reportedly billed the Treasury nearly \u00a333m for its advice during the financial crisis, after receiving an assurance there were \u201cno other aspects of his personal tax affairs that might cast his judgement into further question\u201d. Randell told the select committee on Tuesday that he had failed to see a \u201cwarning signal\u201d about Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP, an investment product that promised members tax reliefs but was subsequently challenged by HM Revenue &amp; Customs. Ingenious Film Partners 2 was a film production partnership that proved popular with many celebrities and sports stars including Steven Gerrard, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham. It used tax breaks designed to encourage films to be made in the UK. Those who put money into the scheme could claim tax relief against film production losses. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury committee, said: \u201cMr Randell\u2019s membership of Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP was picked up during the committee\u2019s preparation for Tuesday\u2019s appointment hearing, and further details have been elicited through my correspondence with the Treasury. \u201cThe committee raised this issue during the hearing. Mr Randell acknowledged that he had made an error of judgement by participating in the scheme. We received an assurance from him that there are no other aspects of his personal tax affairs that might cast his judgement into further question. \u201cAs the report states, the committee was satisfied that Mr Randell has the professional competence and personal independence to be chair of the FCA and the PSR [Payments Systems Regulator].\u201d Morgan had asked Randell on Tuesday if he could see that the Ingenious scheme would look, to the general public, like a \u201crather clever tax wheeze\u201d to let people pay less tax. \u201cYes, I can\u201d, Randell replied. Randell, who said he had repaid \u00a3114,000 plus interest to the taxman, is currently an external member of the prudential regulation committee of the Bank of England and a non-executive board member of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. He is due to take over the top job at the City watchdog in April. He worked at the law firm Slaughter and May from 1980 to 2013, becoming a partner in 1989. He rose to prominence in the City by advising the Treasury on the collapsed lenders Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley during the credit crunch, as well as on the government\u2019s investment into Royal Bank of Scotland and the merger of Lloyds and HBOS. During that time, Slaughter and May was estimated by the National Audit Office to have billed the Treasury \u00a332.9m for its services.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England governor says Brexit has made us poorer - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the Brexit referendum has hurt the UK economy, and made people poorer. Mark Carney told the Treasury committee that real incomes at the end of 2018 will be 5% lower than the Bank had forecast before the EU referendum in June 2016. That\u2019s due to economic uncertainty caused by Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU, and the weaker pound. Households incomes are already 3.5% below where the Bank expected them to be, according to the governor, and that gap will continue to grow this year - even though wages are expected to rise. Carney pointed out that consumption growth has slowed, from 3% in early 2016 to around 1%. Business investment has been lower as firms hit the pause button on major projects. It\u2019s uncertainty about what\u2019s the relationship going to be with our biggest trading partner...Why wouldn\u2019t you hold back if that\u2019s going to be materially affected? Governor Carney also explained that the Bank\u2019s latest forecasts are based on three interest rate rises over the next three years. Encouragingly, he also predicted that people should see wages \u201cfirming\u201d this year, and overtaking inflation. Carney also took issue with his own chief economist, Andy Haldane, over the merits of the weaker sterling. Haldane said the fall in the pound had boosted net trade, and proved that \u2018depreciations work\u2019. Haldane argued: A combination of the weaker pound, and a stronger global economy, has worked its magic. This prompted a slapdown from Carney who insisted that depreciations simply made people poorer. Carney declared: Depreciations don\u2019t work. The have an economic effect, but they\u2019re not a good economic strategy. They may be an outcome of various things... but it\u2019s how you make yourself poorer. Haldane told the committee that the Bank must avoid \u2018stamping\u2019 on the recovery by waiting too long to raise interest rates. By raising borrowing costs in a limited and gradual way, it can avoid a \u2018handbrake\u2019 turn in the future. Historically the thing that has really killed jobs has been central banks stepping on the brakes too late. Haldane also told MPs that he expects wage growth to pick up in the coming months. Some firms may agree pay rises of at least 3%, he suggested, which would close the gap with inflation. Earlier in the day... the latest unemployment data showed that the jobless rate had risen to 4.4%. The unemployment total rose by 46,000 -- three-quarters of this was women - but the employment total also increased as more people stopped being economically inactive. Basic pay rose to 2.5%, up from 2.4% a month earlier, but still below inflation. Unions urged the government to help by raising public sector wages. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The session ends with Nicky Morgan MP congratulating Andy Haldane on his recent school visits. I hope it will help with our pipeline of economists in the future, she signs off. Carney also swerved a question about whether the financial markets expects a Brexit transition deal to be agreed at an EU summit in March. It\u2019s in no-one\u2019s interests for talks to collapse, he suggests. The Bank\u2019s policymakers are now asked about the recent stock market turmoil, and whether shares are now in a bubble. Mark Carney points out that volatility had fallen to extremely low levels, so a rise in volatility is not a threat. Silvana Tenreyro says it\u2019s hard to say whether equities are in a bubble. The recent falls were a \u2018correction\u2019, she adds, and we may see more as interest rates move up. Carney declines to give any investment advice, but he points out that bubbles are often characterised by \u2018new paradigm thinking\u2019, and excessive leverage. Bank of England Mark Carney and chief economist Andy Haldane just disagreed, publicly, over the merits of a weaker currency. Haldane kicked things off by telling the Treasury committee that half of the growth in the UK economy in the last year came from net trade. A combination of the weaker pound, and a stronger global economy, has worked its magic. That has meant that net trade has been a significant contributor, and expect those effects to continue over the next two or three years. A weaker currency, following the Brexit vote, has led to more trade, and less consumption, says Haldane. Haldane declares: Depreciations work, and that\u2019s how they work. But MPC member Silvana Tenreyro, who holds Argentinian citizenship, rejected this idea, saying: Depreciations make people poor. Mark Carney agrees, in what looks like a slap-down of his chief economist: Depreciations don\u2019t work. The have an economic effect, but they\u2019re not a good economic strategy. They may be an outcome of various things... but it\u2019s how you make yourself poorer. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent is also no fan of a weaker currency. The pound has fallen because the foreign exchange market has a pessimistic view about Brexit. If they\u2019re wrong, then the pound could rally. Mark Carney emphasises that the Bank doesn\u2019t have full clarity on Brexit yet - but it should learn a lot more this year. Maybe there are some people in the country who know exactly what the adjustments are going to be, but I\u2019m not one of them. Q: Your forecasts assume a net contribution to GDP from trade every year over the forecast period. Are you assuming a smooth Brexit transition, and a comprehensive free trade deal? We are assuming a smooth transition, and an average of outcomes, says Mark Carney. Those outcomes cover a range of outcomes, from operating under WTO rules to a close partnership similar to Norway\u2019s. Here\u2019s a video clip of Mark Carney\u2019s testimony. Q: If net inward migration falls even more than the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts, you don\u2019t see a significant impact on the economy? You would see an impact on the overall speed limit of the economy, the potential growth of the economy, Mark Carney replies. There could be a bigger effect if some skilled labour doesn\u2019t come in, creating a \u2018bottleneck effect\u2019, he suggests. The Treasury committee are back from their vote, and John Mann MP is probing the Bank of England about migration. He\u2019s suggesting that the first wave of EU migrants into the UK were better educated than today\u2019s arrivals. If so, that could affect their propensity to spend, to buy a house, and to move out of the UK. Q: Does the Bank have any data on this, or on the propensity of migrants to send money back home? If people have bought houses back in their country of origin, aren\u2019t they more likely to move back? Mann also suggests that the research cited by the Bank, which shows migration only has a small impact on wages, is old. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says these issues are \u2018interesting\u2019, but not directly relevant to the Bank\u2019s responsibilities. Silvana Tenreyro agrees that it is \u201cfar from clear\u201d that migrants depress wages. Business Insider have a good write-up of Carney\u2019s comments about the Brexit vote hitting real incomes: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that real incomes are set to be 5% below pre-referendum forecasts by the end of this year. Appearing before the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday, Carney said that British incomes are currently 3.5% below where the central bank had forecast them to be prior to the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union. Economists\u2019 forecasts have been ridiculed for their inaccuracy in many pro-Brexit circles but Carney said the figures were \u201cto be expected\u201d given the effects of the Brexit vote on the economy. \u201cWe\u2019re in a transition period or a pre-transition period is perhaps a better way to put it,\u201d Carney told the Treasury Select Committee. More here: Asked about migration, Andy Haldane says the evidence shows that the impact on wages is \u201crelatively modest\u201d. The session is then interrupted because MPs have to go and vote. Q: Are you saying that things are looking rosier in the economy, asks Charlie Elphicke MP? Marginally, says MPC member Silvia Tenreyro, cautiously. Q: So Brexit is a great success? \u201cUmmmm\u201d, Tenreyro replies. Does Britain have a problem measuring productivity? You can more easily count the number of widgets than the contribution of YouTube to the economy, says deputy governor Ben Broadbent, explaining that it\u2019s harder to measure productivity in a services economy. But he thinks this is only a minor factor. The key message from the Bank of England is that they believe wages are \u2018firming\u2019 . The long-awaited pick-up in wages is starting to take root, says Andy Haldane. January to April is a \u2018crucial time\u2019 for wage negotiations, he adds, suggesting some companies will be offering pay rises \u2018starting with a three\u2019. If he\u2019s right, the long run of falling real wages could soon be over. Q: What does this mean for the Phillips Curve? It\u2019s alive and well, Mark Carney replies happily. [explainer: This is the idea that unemployment and inflation move inversely, so when the labour market tightens, firms raise pay] Deputy governor Ben Broadband agrees that Brexit uncertainty is making UK companies delay taking big, irreversible decisions. The depreciation of the pound has pushed up the cost of investment goods, as well as consumption goods, he explains. But if uncertainty is lifted, there could be a \u201cmarked rise\u201d in business investment...... Q: Why has the UK gone from being one of the fastest G7 economies to the slowest, asks Labour MP Rushanara Ali. Mark Carney agrees that Britain has moved \u201cfrom the top of the pack to the bottom\u201d. He says the UK managed to eat up spare capacity after the financial crisis, and recovered quicker than other major economies. But now, he says, the uncertainty following the EU referendum has hurt growth. Consumption was growing at 3% in the first half of 2016, the governor says. It is now growing a little over 1%. Business investment is three to four percentage points lower than would have been. The uncertainty around Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU is \u201chaving an effect on the demand side of the economy....and that is probably affecting the supply side too.\u201d The fall in real wages, due to rising inflation, is another factor, Carney adds. Real incomes today are 3.5 percentage points lower than the Bank expected in May 2016, and by the end of the year this gap will have widened to 5%, Carney predicts. Q: Doesn\u2019t fiscal policy have to do more to encourage productivity growth? Carney resists the temptation to comment on government tax and spending. Instead, he says the Brexit uncertainty is creating a \u2018short-term\u2019 drag on business investment. It\u2019s uncertainty about \u2018what\u2019s the relationship going to be with out biggest trading partner?\u2019. It means that for this year, why wouldn\u2019t you hold back if it\u2019s going to be materially affected? The UK recovery has been \u2018very jobs rich\u2019, says Mark Carney. But the downside is the weak productivity growth which [reminder: today\u2019s productivity figures were encouraging] The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, suggests that the \u2018speed limit\u2019 for the UK economy is current 1.5%. And then he tells the Treasury Committee that the BoE is committed to raising interest rates in a responsible manner. Otherwise, Haldane warns, the BoE would be forced into more dramatic moves down the line - which could hurt growth and drive up unemployment. Haldane says: Historically the thing that has really killed jobs has been central banks stepping on the brakes too late. As [former Federal Reserve chair] Janet Yellen says, recoveries don\u2019t die of old age, they die because banks step on them, because they react too late. We\u2019re absolutely clear that we don\u2019t want to be back there again, because it\u2019s bad news for jobs. And that means going in this limited and gradual way to head things off in advance to prevent having to step on the brakes and handbrake turn at a later stage. This is \u201cfundamentally\u201d at the root of our role as a central bank, Haldane adds seriously. Here\u2019s a handy chart, showing how the financial markets now expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates faster, compared to the end of October. Mark Carney adds that interest rates won\u2019t return to the pre-crisis average of 5%. Q: Can you narrow down when rates might rise? The BoE governor says that financial markets have begun to price interest rate expectations \u201cin line with the underlying data\u201d. As such, the Bank feels less pressure to directly pre-commit to when it might tighten monetary policy. Q: You say in this month\u2019s quarterly inflation report that the Bank is likely to raise interest rates earlier and faster than expected in November. So what were the expectations then, and what are they now? Mark Carney explains that November\u2019s forecasts were based on a \u2018conditioning path\u2019 of two interest rate rises over the forecast period. But in February, that path has moved to three rate rises -- because the Bank\u2019s new forecasts believe there will \u201cexcess demand\u201d in the UK by the third year of the forecast period. Chief economist Andy Haldane chips in, saying the Bank sees a pick-up in underlying price pressures - including wage growth. That puts pressure on inflation, and increases the move Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says moving from two rate hikes to three over the forecast period isn\u2019t a major change. Q: Any clues for the watching public about when these three rate rises might happen? Carney says the public should expect to see wages firming this year, and a return to real wage growth in 2018. But they should also expect inflation to remain over the Bank\u2019s 2% target - unless there are \u201csufficient and timely\u201d increases in interest rates. So people should be able to anticipate what the Bank will do over the next few years, he argues. The session begins with Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury committee, reminding Mark Carney that he recently told the BBC about his ability not to answer questions. I hope we won\u2019t have that this afternoon.... Carney creases up.... Over in parliament, the Treasury committee are about to interview the Bank of England about its latest quarterly inflation report. They\u2019ll be hearing from BoE governor Mark Carney, deputy governor Ben Broadbent, chief economist Andy Haldane and MPC member Silvana Tenreyro. It should be streamed live here. Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on today\u2019s UK unemployment figure: The number of people out of work in Britain rose at the fastest rate in almost five years, official figures showed on Wednesday, fuelled by an increase in unemployment among young people under the age of 24. After an almost two-year period of continuous declines in unemployment to the lowest levels since the mid 1970s, the number of people out of work rose by 46,000 to 1.47 million in the three months to December, according to the Office for National Statistics. The jobless rate rose to 4.4% against City forecasts for the level to remain unchanged at 4.3%. Despite the increase in unemployment, there was better news from a rise in the number of people in work. The size of the workforce continued to grow, rising by 88,000 to stand at 32.15 million in the three months to December. This was driven by an increase in the numbers of people born in the UK, while there was a drop in workers from eastern Europe. The ONS said there was an increase in the number of full-time employees, and decrease in part-time and self-employed work. John Hawksworth, a chief economist at PwC, said the reading on the labour market was positive because it showed more previously inactive people seeking work, some of them finding jobs and others still searching and so being classified as unemployed. And here\u2019s the full story: Alongside the unemployment figures, the Office for National Statistics also reported that UK productivity has risen. Output per worker per hour jumped by 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. That\u2019s an encouraging sign. But...Accenture\u2019s chief economist, Mark Purdy, says it\u2019s too early to declare Britain\u2019s productivity problems solved. He argues that businesses need to take better advantage of artificial intelligence, and boost UK growth. The real game changers for productivity will lie in adoption of advanced technologies, infrastructure investment and reskilling of the workforce for the industries of the future. In particular, the UK must capitalise on its strong base of expertise in artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous vehicles. The potential is huge\u2014our research shows AI could provide a \u00a3614bn boost to the UK economy by 2035. AI can not only drive greater efficiency, but enhance the productivity of the workforce and spur greater innovation in the economy. The technologies are there and the UK businesses can get a head start in this race.\u201d That\u2019s a good excuse to post this video, showing one of Boston Dynamics\u2019 dog robots in action: As this charts shows, the female unemployment rate in the UK has risen from 4.1% in the autumn to 4.4% by the end of 2017. Britain\u2019s employment minister, Alok Sharma, has welcomed the news that employment has risen - by 321,000 in the last 12 months. Sharma says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show that this Government is building a fairer economy that supports people from all backgrounds.\u201d But Labour\u2019s Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, pointed to 46,000 rise in unemployment during the quarter (including 35,000 women): \u201cThe rise in unemployment is further evidence of the Tories\u2019 economic failure, which has resulted in regional inequalities, wages failing to keep up with prices and millions of workers trapped in low paid, insecure work. \u201cEight million people in working households live in poverty and the number of children in poverty is set to soar to a record 5.2 million over the next five years.\u201d The pound is continuing to drop following the news that UK unemployment has risen. It\u2019s now trading at $1.392 against the US dollar, down 0.7 of a cent. It\u2019s also down 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1312. Predictions that today\u2019s jobs data would put more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates have been dashed. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, explains: Sterling is coming under a bit of pressure this morning after UK jobs data for the three months to December showed wages still growing at a moderate pace and unemployment ticking up to 4.4%. While a higher reading on wage growth may have triggered a more bullish response from the pound, the data turned out to be quite insignificant as it\u2019s unlikely to change the views at the Bank of England. The Resolution Foundation have sent over some charts, showing how UK real wages are still shrinking - even though basic pay growth rose to 2.5% in the last quarter. Matthew Percival, head of employment at the CBI, argues that business are doing their bit by creating more vacancies than ever before: \u201cRising unemployment is disappointing, but job vacancies reaching another record shows that businesses are creating opportunities. This underlines why skills, including retraining, need to be at the heart of our industrial strategy so that everyone can benefit from the opportunities created by economic growth. \u201cMeanwhile, slowing productivity growth and rising pay growth makes an interest rate increase more likely.\u201d Most of the 46,000 people who joined the unemployment total last month were women. The ONS reports that the number of unemployed women jumped by 35,000 in October-December, to 689,000. In contrast, the number of unemployed men rose by 11,000 during the quarter, to 782,000. Updated: Some of those 35,000 women will have lost their jobs during the quarter. But this total also includes people who have returned to the labour market in the last few months, and who haven\u2019t yet found a job (thanks to the ONS for flagging this up). Dr Carole Easton OBE, chief executive of the Young Women\u2019s Trust, fears that younger women are struggling to get work. She says firms need to stop discriminating against female applicants, close the gender pay gap, and provide affordable childcare to help women into the labour force. Dr Easton says: \u201cThe increase in unemployment we can see today has been driven by young women being out of work. \u201c21,000 more young women are now unemployed \u2013 a dramatic increase on the last quarter. Young women\u2019s unemployment is now at its highest level since summer 2016. We should see this as a warning sign. \u201cYoung women are telling us they want to work but hundreds of thousands are getting shut out of the jobs market, including by employer discrimination, low pay and unaffordable childcare. Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School, says today\u2019s report paints a \u2018mixed picture\u2019. The number of unemployed has risen by 46000 over the last three months of 2017, so that the unemployment rate now stands at 4.4%. The increased unemployment has been quite uneven across the UK, with marked increases in Wales, Scotland and the East but falls in some other regions. Meanwhile across the UK the number of workers in employment also increased, as a result of a fall in the numbers who are economically inactive. Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, reckons the UK jobs market is running out of steam. But the better news is that wages should finally overtake inflation soon. Brinkley explains: \u201cThe substantial and unexpected rise in unemployment is a clear warning that the UK labour market may be running out of steam, but there are reasons to believe that this is a one-off, as opposed to the beginning of a larger employment crisis. There has still been a significant rise in employment dominated by an increase in full time, permanent jobs, while some of the rise in unemployment may be attributed to more students entering the labour market. \u201cThe strengthening of wage growth is also a welcome sign as, when coupled with likely falls in inflation, it opens up the possibility of real wage growth in the coming months, which will be a great relief to those workers who have seen their pay packets squeezed for months on end.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, has dug into the jobs data -- and reports that it\u2019s not all bad news. \u201cThere was an unexpected rise in unemployment between the third and fourth quarters of 2017, but closer inspection suggests this is not a sign of labour market weakness as it was also accompanied by a healthy rise in total employment, focused on full-time jobs. Instead, it reflects more previously inactive people seeking work, some of them finding jobs and others still searching and so being classified as unemployed. The TUC have calculated that real wages have now been falling for 10 months in a row. That\u2019s because regular earnings have consistently lagged inflation since early 2017 (when the plunge in the pound after the Brexit vote drove up import costs). TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is urging the government to act by raising public sector wages. \u201cThe great pay squeeze continues. This is the tenth month in a row that real wages have fallen. \u201cBritain\u2019s cost of living crisis is pushing families to the brink. But the government is failing to act. \u201cMinisters must give public sector workers the pay rise they have earned and invest in jobs working people can live on. \u201cIn-work poverty is soaring on their watch.\u201d Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, agrees that household budgets are still being squeezed: \u201cThese statistics reiterate what we all knew, wages aren\u2019t rising in line with inflation meaning the pounds in our pockets will buy us less. It\u2019s great more people are in work, however, with prices rising faster than our pay packets, keeping a tight budget is a must. \u201cOur disposable income is still under pressure although employment rates are high they have fallen slightly, and wages just aren\u2019t keeping up. It\u2019s so important you make the most of your money and are savvy with your finances. You could save hundreds of pounds by simply switching your energy supplier or transferring old debt onto a credit card that doesn\u2019t charge you interest for a set amount of time.\u201d Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool says today\u2019s labour market statistics give the Bank of England \u2018a lot to think about\u2019. He believes it could deter some Monetary Policy Committee policymakers from raising interest rates in May. Professor Milas explains: Although basic pay, up to 2.5% (from 2.4% previously) seems to be heading towards the MPC\u2019s forecast of 2.75% by 2018Q3, the rise in unemployment rate from 4.3% to 4.4% is a surprise. Only a few days ago, the MPC\u2019s expectation was for an unemployment rate of 4.3% in 2017Q4, a further (albeit slight) drop to \u201caround 4.25%\u201d up until 2018Q3 and a further drop to 4.1% by 2021Q1. It was this forecast that fuelled expectations of higher, than previously thought, interest rates on the grounds that the economy would be able to afford an increase in the policy rate without a damaging impact on unemployment. Today\u2019s unemployment rate is potentially a turning point on the thinking of MPC members. It is more likely than not that they will want to see a reversal of this rise in unemployment in the next few months before contemplating another interest rate hike in May 2018. This is from Jamie McGeever of Reuters: Public sector walkouts have hit their lowest level in at least 21 years, today\u2019s report shows. Just 44,000 days work were lost to strikes in the public sector during 2017, the ONS says. That\u2019s the lowest figure since records began in 1996. In addition, there were 232,000 working days lost in the private sector last year. That includes industrial action on UK train services, and McDonald\u2019s first UK strike ever. Today\u2019s report shows that UK firm are struggling to find workers, even though unemployment has risen. The number of vacancies hit a record high in the last quarter, up 24,000 to 823,000. Economist Rupert Seggins points out that Britain\u2019s wage squeeze continues, despite average earnings growth picking up: This chart shows how Britain\u2019s jobless rate has ticked up, after a long period of falling unemployment: The pound has fallen by half a cent, on the back of the unemployment figures. City traders are concluding that the Bank of England is less likely to raise interest rates soon while unemployment is rising.... even though wages also picked up. Sterling has fallen to $1.394, from around $1.40. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Traders do not like the idea that the unemployment is ticking higher and wage growth has no real strength. UK wage growth has picked up, but earnings are still lagging behind inflation. Basic pay rose by 2.5% per year in the three months to December, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u2019s up from 2.4% in the previous month. Pay including bonuses also rose by 2.5% in the quarter - unchanged from last month. Britain\u2019s inflation rate is currently running at 3%, so workers are still being hit with a real wage squeeze - but at least the gap is narrowing. Breaking! Britain\u2019s jobless rate has risen for the first time in almost two years. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% in the three months to December, up from 4.3% (a four-decade low). The number of people out of work rose by 46,000 to 1.47 million. But... the number of people in work also rose, by 88,000 during the quarter, to 32.147 million. More to follow... Growth across the eurozone seems to be slowing this month, but remains pretty strong. The latest Eurozone \u2018purchasing managers index\u2019 from data firm Markit has fallen to 57.5 this month, down from 58.8 in January. Any reading over 50 shows that activity grew during the month. This is the slowest expansion since last November, but it\u2019s still robust. January\u2019s figures were the best in almost 12 years. Companies reported that new order growth slowed to a five-month low. More encouragingly, eurozone bosses said they are actually more optimistic about their future prospects. Chris Williamson of Markit says the picture still looks bright. \u201cThe service sector is enjoying its best growth spell for seven years and the manufacturing sector\u2019s performance remains one of the strongest seen over the 20-year survey history. Companies in France and Germany both reported that they have kept growing this month, although at a slower rate than in January. Ouch! Shares in AA have plunged by a quarter this morning to a fresh record low, after the company cut its profit forecasts and outlined a new strategy. CEO Simon Breakwell announced his new strategy, including extra investment in roadside rescue, a focus on younger drivers, more competitive pricing. It is also planning a new push for its Car Genie product - a piece of kit designed to spot technical problems early. Breakwell says: The strategic plan I am setting out today will unlock the full potential of the AA by delivering targeted and strategic investment in our people, our products, our systems and operations. We are building on the solid foundation that our investments since the IPO have created. It will take the AA from a company helping when you break down to one actually predicting when you might break down in the first place. This plan will deliver front line resource to improve the efficiency, predictability and resilience of our operations as well as investment in game-changing growth drivers - in Connected Car and Insurance. These investments, while reducing our short term profitability, are vital to our long term success. All this will cost money. So the AA has lowered its 2019 profit forecasts, and decided to only pay a dividend of 2p per share in future - down from 5p this financial year. The City has responded by wiping nearly a third off the company\u2019s share price. It\u2019s fallen from 116p to just 81p this morning. In a boost for long-suffering Lloyds shareholders, the bank has reported its biggest profit since the financial crisis and announced a \u00a31bn share buyback. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Lloyds Banking Group posted sharply higher profits for 2017 and announced plans to return \u00a31bn to shareholders after a \u201clandmark year\u201d that saw the high street lender return to private ownership after its taxpayer bailout in 2008. The bank reported a 24% increase in pre-tax profit to \u00a35.3bn last year, and said its strong capital position would allow the \u00a31bn share buyback, worth up to 1.4p per share. Lloyds shares are up 1.3% in early trading, to 68.82p. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover if Britain\u2019s economy is continuing to create jobs, and learn how much the UK government raked in from taxpayers last month. The latest unemployment figures (due at 9.30am) are expected to show that the UK jobless rate stuck at just 4.3% in the last quarter of 2017, the lowest in over 40 years. But the bigger question is whether wages picked up. Economists predict that basic pay rose by 2.4% per annum in the three months December, while pay including bonuses rose by 2.5%. That would match last month\u2019s figures, and mean that earnings are still falling behind inflation (3% in January). A strong earnings report would be very welcome, as households have suffered a long cost of living squeeze since inflation started shooting higher. But, it might also encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates in a couple of months time - bad news for indebted families who are already struggling. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The earnings figures will be the ones to watch as job creation in the UK has greatly outpaced wage increases. Average earnings has been slow to pick up, and should we see it tick up it could trigger another leg higher in the pound. The most recent Bank of England (BoE) update showed us they are little on the hawkish side, and they signalled interest rates could rise sooner that some traders thought. If Britons see a respectable jump in wages, then we are more likely to see a rise in consumer spending. Dealers are preparing themselves for the possibility of a rate hike in May and the average earnings could be the catalyst. We\u2019ll get an insight into the Bank\u2019s thinking, when BoE governor Mark Carney faces MPs this afternoon to discuss the latest quarterly inflation report. He\u2019ll be accompanied by Ben Broadbent, Andy Haldane and Silvana Tenreyro. We also get the latest UK public finances. They\u2019re expected to show that Britain raised around \u00a39.5bn in January - always a bumper month for tax receipts. Data firm Markit will give its early assessment of how the eurozone\u2019s economy is faring. Plus, banking group Lloyds, housebuilder Barratt and roadside assistance group AA are reporting results.

Some say it is coming from a secret installation built on a Native American burial ground. Ha ha. Yes, but seriously. No, there is actually a restricted American steel mill just across the river on Zug Island, that also happens to be a former Native American burial ground. You may scoff ... I plan to ... But a Canadian government report in 2011 found that Zug Island was the most likely cause, as did a University of Windsor report in 2014. Unfortunately, US Steel won\u2019t let anyone investigate the site, or even discuss what it is for. Sounds like a job for Mulder and Scully. Yes, and they already looked into something similar in 1998, when a man (played by Bryan Cranston, no less) is tortured by what Mulder calls \u201celectrical nerve gas\u201d, which he says \u201cmay be behind the so-called Taos hum\u201d. Another one? Yes, the Taos hum has bothered some residents of Taos, New Mexico for a long time. And similar hums have been reported around the world, everywhere from Auckland to Bristol. Cripes. Is US Steel trying to take over the world? It may well be, although it probably had nothing to do with all those other hums, which were most likely a combination of traffic and industrial noise. Boo! Boring. Or people with tinnitus might believe there is a hum. Or people might listen so attentively to background noise that it feels like a hum. So nuisance hums sometimes happen for a variety of industrial, physiological and psychological reasons? You have a talent for taking the fun out of things. Do say: \u201cWhy does a secret factory built on a Native American burial ground hum?\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t know the words.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is to hand more than \u00a33bn in dividends and surplus capital to shareholders and has awarded its chief executive a bumper \u00a36.4m payout just nine months after returning to full private ownership following its taxpayer bailout in 2008. The group, the largest bank in Britain with 27 million customers, posted a 24% jump in pretax profits to \u00a35.3bn. In a bonanza for shareholders, Lloyds hiked its dividend by 20% and announced a buyback programme worth an extra \u00a31bn. The chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s pay, including bonuses, increased 11% to \u00a36.4m in 2017 from \u00a35.8 in 2016. Unions said it contrasted with an average pay increase for staff of just 2% in 2017. In a scathing attack on Britain\u2019s banks on Tuesday the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, promised \u201ca fundamental rethink of whom finance should serve and how it should be regulated \u2026 We will take decisive action to make finance the servant of industry, not the masters of us all.\u201d But in a surprise response, Horta-Os\u00f3rio said: \u201cI have read what Jeremy Corbyn said. He is very focused on ensuring the banks are helping the real economy, and that is what Lloyds is also about.\u201d He promised a new three-year \u00a33bn investment in the bank and billions more in loans for startups and small businesses. In an upbeat assessment of the British economy, Horta-Os\u00f3rio said that while the UK faces political and economic uncertainty \u201cwe see an economy that is resilient, employment growth to continue \u2026 and where exports are growing consistently ahead of imports for the first time in six years. We expect GDP growth in 2018 to be around the same levels as 2017.\u201d But he warned mortgage customers of pricing pressure that could see loan interest rates march upwards as the Bank of England\u2019s term funding scheme ends this month. Under the TFS banks have borrowed \u00a3106bn from the Bank of England at rock-bottom interest rates, but that money must now be repaid. Analysts are pencilling in the next rise in the Bank of England base rate for May, but Horta-Os\u00f3rio predicted that rates would rise only gently over the next few years, reaching just 1.25% by 2020. Lloyds continues to be dogged by payouts for payment protection insurance mis-selling. It took a \u00a31.65bn charge for PPI last year, up from \u00a31bn in 2016. The lender had to pay \u00a3600m in the fourth quarter after weekly complaints rose from 9,000 to 11,000. Lloyds\u2019 bill for the PPI mis-selling scandal now stands at \u00a318.7bn. Undeterred by past mis-selling scandals, the bank sees pensions and insurance as its major growth area for future years. It has set itself the target of obtaining a million new pension customers by 2020. The branch network will continue to slim down \u2013 Lloyds announced 49 closures in November \u2013 but Horta-Os\u00f3rio declined to give a figure on further cuts despite being repeatedly pressed. He pledged the bank would maintain its share of all bank branches in the UK at about 21% of the total. The surge in profits and payouts saw Lloyds shares climb nearly 3% higher despite higher PPI provisions than expected. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank of England\u2019s decision in November to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade was welcome news for Lloyds. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to like in Lloyds\u2019 numbers, with profits rising, costs under control and prodigious amounts of cash being thrown off to shareholders. \u201cThe Bank of England can take its fair share of credit for Lloyds\u2019 profits, as rising interest rates have delivered a boost to the top line. For the banking industry the prospect of rising rates after a decade of loose monetary policy is a bit like finally coming across an oasis in the middle of the desert.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The storage depot at the centre of the KFC chicken crisis had not been registered or inspected before problems emerged this week, and could have been closed down for breaching safety rules, a local council has revealed. Hundreds of KFC outlets remain closed as the fast food chain tries to recover from a disastrous start to a new delivery contract. On Tuesday night KFC said delivery drivers had been working around the clock in an effort to ensure that all the affected stores could reopen by the end of the week. DHL, the firm that took over KFC deliveries last week, has been storing all KFC chicken at a single unregistered cold storage warehouse in Rugby, the local council confirmed on Wednesday. KFC said some poultry at the depot would have to be destroyed. A spokeswoman for Rugby borough council, which is responsible for food and environmental health standards in the area, said the council had not known the building was being used to store fresh chicken until reading about it in the media. She said the council could have closed the warehouse because it companies were legally required to register cold-storage facilities. \u201cCouncil inspectors visited the depot on Tuesday because they were not aware it was operating as a cold storage depot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could have served a remedial action notice to stop them operating until the conditional approval had been obtained, but we did not consider that this would have been in the public interest.\u201d In a statement, the council added: \u201cThere is no requirement for the DHL cold-storage facility to be licensed, but it does need to be registered. We have now received the relevant documentation and expect to be able to approve the registration in the next few days.\u201d A KFC spokeswoman said it was trying to minimise waste at the depot but \u201cnothing will leave for delivery or be served at our restaurants that doesn\u2019t meet our incredibly high standards. At this stage, we don\u2019t know [how much chicken will be destroyed], but we are doing everything we can to avoid wastage.\u201d Rugby council\u2019s statement said inspectors were satisfied with DHL\u2019s food safety processes, including temperature control, date coding, food handling and associated record-keeping. \u201cThey didn\u2019t observe any out-of-date chicken or other foods.\u201d The GMB union warned KFC last October that it would face supply problems when it decided to switch its deliveries from Bidvest Logistics to DHL. Mick Rix, the GMB\u2019s national officer, said he told KFC that it could face a repeat of supply problems that had hit Burger King when it dropped Bidvest Logistics in favour of DHL six years ago. At the height of the current crisis, more than 640 KFC outlets were closed because of the shortage of chicken. The latest update showed 272 stores across the UK and Ireland remained closed on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, KFC said: \u201cOur teams continue to work flat out all hours to clear the backlog caused by the breakdown in the DHL distribution system. \u201cWe still expect the disruption to some restaurants to continue over the remainder of the week which means some will not be open and others will operate with a reduced menu or shortened hours.\u201d The consumer backlash against KFC prompted police to urge people in Tower Hamlets, east London, and Whitefield, Greater Manchester, not to waste officers\u2019 time complaining about the closures. Bidvest distanced itself from the crisis, saying all the problems had occurred since DHL took over deliveries.",

      "body": "<p>The storage depot at the centre of the KFC chicken crisis had not been registered or inspected before problems emerged this week, and could have been closed down for breaching safety rules, a local council has revealed.</p> <p>Hundreds of KFC outlets remain closed as the fast food chain tries to recover from a disastrous start to a new delivery contract. On Tuesday night <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KFC_UKI/status/966231752271450114\">KFC said delivery drivers had been working around the clock</a> in an effort to ensure that all the affected stores could reopen by the end of the week. </p> <p>DHL, the firm that took over KFC deliveries last week, has been storing all KFC chicken at a single unregistered cold storage warehouse in Rugby, the local council confirmed on Wednesday.</p> <p>KFC said some poultry at the depot would have to be destroyed.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Rugby borough council, which is responsible for food and environmental health standards in the area, said the council had not known the building was being used to store fresh chicken until reading about it in the media.<br></p> <p>She said the council could have closed the warehouse because it companies were legally required to register cold-storage facilities. </p> <p>\u201cCouncil inspectors visited the depot on Tuesday because they were not aware it was operating as a cold storage depot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could have served a remedial action notice to stop them operating until the conditional approval had been obtained, but we did not consider that this would have been in the public interest.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, the council added: \u201cThere is no requirement for the DHL cold-storage facility to be licensed, but it does need to be registered. We have now received the relevant documentation and expect to be able to approve the registration in the next few days.\u201d</p> <p>A KFC spokeswoman said it was trying to minimise waste at the depot but \u201cnothing will leave for delivery or be served at our restaurants that doesn\u2019t meet our incredibly high standards. At this stage, we don\u2019t know [how much chicken will be destroyed], but we are doing everything we can to avoid wastage.\u201d</p> <p>Rugby council\u2019s statement said inspectors were satisfied with DHL\u2019s food safety processes, including temperature control, date coding, food handling and associated record-keeping. \u201cThey didn\u2019t observe any out-of-date chicken or other foods.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/20/kfc-was-warned-about-switching-uk-delivery-contractor-union-says\">GMB union warned KFC last October that it would face supply problems</a> when it decided to switch its deliveries from Bidvest Logistics to DHL.<br></p> <p>Mick Rix, the GMB\u2019s national officer, said he told KFC that it could face a repeat of supply problems that had hit Burger King when it dropped Bidvest Logistics in favour of DHL six years ago.</p> <p>At the height of the current crisis, more than 640 KFC outlets were closed because of the shortage of chicken. The <a href=\"https://www.kfc.co.uk/crossed-the-road\">latest update</a> showed 272 stores across the UK and Ireland remained closed on Wednesday afternoon. <br></p> <p>In a statement, KFC said:<em> </em>\u201cOur teams continue to work flat out all hours to clear the backlog caused by the breakdown in the DHL distribution system.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe still expect the disruption to some restaurants to continue over the remainder of the week which means some will not be open and others will operate with a reduced menu or shortened hours.\u201d</p> <p>The consumer backlash against KFC prompted police to urge people in Tower Hamlets, east London, and Whitefield, Greater Manchester, not to waste officers\u2019 time complaining about the closures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GMPWhitefield/status/966067402013364225\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For those who contacted the Police about KFC being out of chicken ...  please STOP.

Revealing a new strategy, the company said plans to invest \u00a345m to improve the business would weigh on profits for the year ending January 2019. It expects profits over the period to be in the range of \u00a3335m to \u00a3345m, below City expectations of \u00a3387m. Annual dividend payments to shareholders will be cut to 2p a share, down from 5p the previous year. The news sent the share price down 23% to 89p, compared with a price of 250p when the firm floated in 2014. The firm is hoping to capitalise on its \u201ccar genie\u201d device, launched in August with the potential to predict up to a third of breakdowns before they happen, according to the AA. Simon Breakwell, the AA\u2019s chief executive since September, said a strategic overhaul and new investment were crucial to the firm\u2019s future. \u201cIt will take the AA from a company helping when you break down to one actually predicting when you might break down in the first place. These investments, while reducing our short term profitability, are vital to our long term success.\u201d The AA said it was now marketing to younger customers, as well as its traditional 50-year plus core demographic, and working on plans to offer a simple and easy breakdown service through new digital products. Targets for 2021 include a return to membership growth, half of all members to be registered on the AA\u2019s app, and a 20% reduction in breakdowns reported through its call centres. The company is also hoping to persuade more of its 3.3m customers to take out AA insurance policies. Currently, just 9% have motor insurance policies with the firm and it is aiming for a total of 2m motor and home policies by 2023, up from 1.4m currently. The AA is in dispute with its former chairman, Bob Mackenzie, who is taking the company to an employment tribunal after being sacked last year following a \u201csustained and violent assault\u201d on a colleague at a five-star hotel, which was captured on hotel CCTV. Mackenzie\u2019s lawyers are understood to be claiming that he was wrongfully dismissed, having been under extreme pressure, and should be entitled to damages. He had been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in the stock market flotation.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prospect of an interest rate rise before the summer has receded after the number of people out of work in Britain rose at the fastest rate in almost five years. Fuelled by an increase in unemployment among young people under the age of 24, the number of jobless rose by 46,000 to stand at 1.47 million in the three months to December, according to the Office for National Statistics. The rise in unemployment, which comes after it fell to levels not seen since the mid-1970s, pushed the jobless rate to 4.4% against City forecasts for the level to remain unchanged at 4.3%. The worsening picture was emphasised by figures showing a slowdown in the creation of jobs, a fall in the number of hours worked and a dip in productivity growth. The Bank of England said this month that the UK economy was beginning to overheat after a sharp rise in inflation and a tightening labour market. In its quarterly inflation report it said an interest rise was only months away if the rising demand for workers, which is reflected in the huge growth in vacancies, continued to force up pay growth. Wednesday\u2019s ONS data showed that average weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.5%, beating City forecasts for the rate of pay growth to stay unchanged at 2.4%. However, this remains below the rate of inflation, meaning workers are yet to see real wage growth. Maike Currie, an investment director at fund manager Fidelity International, said: \u201cWith the Bank of England increasingly pinning the chances of further interest rate hikes on accelerating pay growth, the prospect of an early rate rise seems unlikely.\u201d Compared with inflation, take-home wages were worth 0.3% less in December than the year before. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe great pay squeeze continues. This is the 10th month in a row that real wages have fallen.\u201d Most of the increase in wages over the last year has gone to managerial and professional workers while those on lower incomes have relied on increases in the \u201cnational living wage\u201d to boost their living standards. On a more upbeat note, the ONS said there was an increase in the number of full-time employees and a decrease in part-time and self-employed work. John Hawksworth, the chief economist of accountancy group PwC, said it was encouraging that previously inactive people were seeking work in greater numbers, some of them finding jobs and others still searching and so being classified as unemployed. He said this showed that the rise in unemployment was a spin-off from people entering the jobs market. Some analysts said the contradictory signals from the employment figures made it more difficult to predict whether the Bank\u2019s interest rate setting committee would increase rates by 0.25% to 0.75% at its meeting in May. John Philpott, the director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said the economic picture was perplexing because pay had increased at a time when unemployment rose, which is unusual because pay rises tend to come when there are fewer people out of work. \u201cIt clearly adds to the conundrums facing economists, not least those at the Bank of England when they next consider if and when to raise interest rates,\u201d he said. The total number of hours worked fell by 0.3%, while growth in output per hour worked, which is a measure of labour productivity, dipped from 0.9% to 0.8%. \u201cIn other words, a labour market that struggled to boost pay when getting tighter, just saw pay strengthen when conditions got a bit weaker,\u201d said Philpott. \u201cThis pattern is difficult to explain, though may become clearer as more data become available. However, it clearly adds to the conundrums facing economists, not least those at the Bank of England when they next consider if and when to raise interest rates.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Choose your own best illustration of the underhand and devious techniques employed by Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s Global Restructuring Group to gouge small business customers via fees, made-up penalties and punitive interest rates. There are dozens in the regulatory report that \u2013 finally \u2013 has been put on public display. Here\u2019s a contender from the infamous \u201cJust Hit Budget\u201d memo: \u201cBe specific: avoid round number fees \u2013 \u00a35,300 sounds as if you have thought about it, \u00a35k sounds like you haven\u2019t.\u201d That perfectly captures GRG\u2019s spirit of cold calculation. That the customer should be screwed was a given. It was just a technical matter, with little subtlety required, of how to maintain the pretence that GRG was merely engaged in the everyday business of recovering a bad debt. A team leader is a junior job, so the relevant question is who was orchestrating affairs. Who was doing the real thinking \u2013 not about the merit of charging \u00a35,300, but about creating or tolerating a culture in which \u201cwidespread\u201d and \u201csystematic\u201d bad treatment of customers could flourish? The report for the Financial Conduct Authority from the specialist agency Promontory is commendably clear that accountability should go to the top. The failings \u201cwere not the one-off errors of staff\u201d. Rather, GRG and RBS failed \u201cto put in place the appropriate governance and oversight procedures\u201d. GRG management \u201cwas aware (or should have been aware) of these issues\u201d. There was \u201can intentional and co-ordinated strategy\u201d to focus on GRG\u2019s commercial objectives and to place \u201cinadequate weight\u201d on the interests of customers. The Promontory report doesn\u2019t point fingers at senior individuals, since that is the FCA\u2019s job. The regulator, which seems to have accepted the basic veracity of the report, must now complete its \u201cfocused\u201d investigation as speedily as possible. The top duo at RBS in the 2008-13 period under review were the chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who now chairs GlaxoSmithKline, and the chief executive Stephen Hester, who runs insurer RSA these days. Both may have been far away from the frontline at GRG but it is surely reasonable to expect them, even amid the chaos and confusion at post-crash RBS, to have asked how their restructuring unit was managing to spit out surprisingly large profits. Then there\u2019s Nathan Bostock, head of restructuring and risk at RBS and thus more directly tied to GRG. His case is the most pressing since he\u2019s still in the banking game. He is chief executive of Santander UK, a bank with ambitions to be bigger in lending to small businesses. The FCA is handicapped in two ways. First, commercial lending is not a regulated activity, even when the businesses are sometimes so small that they\u2019re more akin to retail customers. Second, 2008-13 was another regulatory era; under the old rules an individual had to be shown to be culpable, which required a high burden of proof. It is only since 2016 that specific responsibilities at big banks have been pinned on senior individuals, making sins of both commission and omission easier to identify. Those are the obstacles facing Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. His task is not easy, but he will know that the public will be outraged if yet another tale of bad banking dribbles into the sands of collective responsibility. Santander\u2019s board, however, can\u2019t wait until the FCA opines. Now that its business customers can read the Promontory report in full it must decide whether Bostock is still a credible boss. The question is best answered sharpish \u2013 like, within days. Treasury and Charles Randell\u2019s Ingenious investment In other FCA news, we learn that the incoming chairman Charles Randell used one of those film-related tax avoidance wheezes beloved by certain celebrities and footballers. It was \u201cerror of judgment\u201d, he concedes, and he had to repay the tax when HMRC clamped down on Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP. The curious part of the affair, however, is that Randell disclosed his Ingenious (the clue was in the name, surely) entanglement at his job interview at the Treasury but was not asked about the sums involved. The detail of the tax repayment \u2013 a cool \u00a3114,000 plus interest \u2013 only emerged in later correspondence prompted by the Treasury select committee. Maybe the Treasury\u2019s assessment panel thinks it was jolly sporting of Randell to cough up in the first place and thought that asking for actual figures would be vulgar. But \u00a3114,000 is serious money in the real world. Are all Treasury interviews so soft?",
