      "bodyText": "Ian Read, chief executive of Pfizer, has been obsessed with finding a tax \u201cinversion\u201d deal for at least two years. He tried AstraZeneca but lost the takeover scrap in embarrassing fashion. Then, it is said, he tried to chat up GlaxoSmithKline but got nowhere. Now he\u2019s landed on Allergan, the Botox firm that is the biggest Irish company you never realised was Irish. After such a long and difficult search for a dance partner, you might assume Read would want to proclaim from the rooftops that he has finally found a way to reduce Pfizer\u2019s tax bills and return overseas cash to shareholders without the US authorities taking a large bite. In fact, he buried the detail of the tax wheeze in the eighth paragraph of the \u201cmerger\u201d announcement. Shareholders had to wade through acres of guff about bringing together \u201ctwo biopharma powerhouses to change lives for the better\u201d before Pfizer got to the nub of it: \u201cPfizer anticipates that the combined company will have a pro forma adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 17%-18%.\u201d That\u2019s the logic of the deal \u2013 a previous 26% tax rate falls to 17%-18%. Coyness is understandable since Read, in effect, is sending a \u201ccatch us if you can\u201d message to the US lawmakers \u2013 and President Barack Obama \u2013 who regard tax inversions as \u201cunpatriotic\u201d. US legislators have tried to construct legal hurdles to deter inversions but Pfizer\u2019s tax-planners obviously believe that, by structuring this agreement as a bid by Allergan, they\u2019re in the clear. There is nothing, after all, to prevent foreign companies buying US companies, and it is apparently irrelevant that Allergan was itself created via an inversion deal in 2013. But, while Pfizer may be able to rush this deal to completion before US legislators can react, it is surely nonsense to think US politicians will then shrug their shoulders and carry on as if nothing has happened. Pfizer is a company that, like most US pharma giants, has prospered for decades on the back of the high prices Americans pay for their prescription medicines. Read simply ignores that long relationship as he warbles on about gaining \u201ca more competitive footing in our industry\u201d. The US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, already on the warpath on drug prices, won\u2019t be so breezy, one suspects. Pfizer will be a company worth $360bn (\u00a3238bn) after consuming Allergan and thus presents a more substantive target than a former hedge fund manager whacking up the price of an obscure toxoplasmosis drug. There is an easy populistic line for Clinton to adopt with Pfizer: you don\u2019t like our taxes, and we really don\u2019t like your prices. Perhaps the anticipation of battles ahead explains why Pfizer\u2019s shareholders seem less than enthused about Read\u2019s proposed injection of Botox. The share price, down since the deal was announced, hasn\u2019t even managed a cosmetic improvement. Playtech told to play fair Is there a difference between betting on horses, cards or roulette, and betting on financial markets? In regulatory eyes, yes, as Playtech, the London-listed Israeli firm is finding out. Playtech, big in online gambling software, has pulled its planned \u00a3460m takeover of Plus500, a firm that enables private punters to pretend they\u2019re City professionals by trading contracts for difference and other fancy financial instruments. \u201cCertain concerns\u201d raised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) could not be resolved by the end of the year, the deadline for completing the deal, said Playtech. Nobody is prepared to explain those concerns but it is not hard to guess why the FCA might wish to probe any owner of Plus500 closely. Earlier this year, Plus500 was told to check the identity of all its customers after being found to have breached UK rules to prevent money-laundering. Playtech, in theory, can try to find alternative financial betting companies to try to buy. Frankly, though, what\u2019s the point? The Central Bank of Ireland has already opposed its acquisition of Ava Trade, a Dublin-based platform for trading currencies. That leaves Playtech\u2019s financial business comprising just TradeFX, which is regulated out of Cyprus and thus does not provide a valuable passport to bigger markets. Best stick to sport and cards. An unsound investment When he accepted a \u00a33,000 donation from Loudwater Investment Partners in 2013, Wes Streeting, now the recently elected Labour MP for Ilford North, could not have known he could end up as a member of the Treasury select committee in 2015. But, now that he\u2019s on the committee, the donation looks awkward. Loudwater is 5% controlled by William Stevenson, son of Lord Stevenson, former chairman of HBOS who was himself a director of Loudwater until 2012. The Treasury committee, of course, is now re-examining HBOS, and matters arising, after last week\u2019s much-delayed report into the bank\u2019s failure. Streeting declared the donation properly and promptly, it should be said. And he can deal with any perceived conflict on interest in the standard way \u2013 draw attention to the donation before taking part in HBOS-related sessions \u2013 and that will be the end of the matter. All the same, do your research: even in 2013, a quick Google of Loudwater would have revealed the Stevenson link, which was probably best avoided even at the time.",

      "bodyText": "Glencore\u2019s deal to export Libyan oil is not worth the paper it is printed on, the commodities company has been told. The Switzerland-based firm agreed last week to buy up to half of Libya\u2019s oil exports from the western division of the National Oil Company in Tripoli, where an Islamist-backed government is based. But the internationally recognised government in Benghazi, in eastern Libya, said Glencore had signed a deal with the wrong people. Nagi Elmagrabi, chairman of the eastern division of the National Oil Company, told Bloomberg that he had written to Glencore asking for an explanation but not yet received a reply. He said that if Glencore had signed a deal with the parallel regime in Tripoli, the Benghazi government could physically prevent Glencore tankers from using Libyan ports. The deal in question envisages Glencore loading and finding buyers for crude oil from the Sarir and Messla fields, exported via Tobruk\u2019s Marsa el-Hariga port in the east. The eastern government says it does not recognise any agreement signed with Tripoli. Finding a way to resolve the impasse could prove particularly lucrative for Glencore, given that Libya\u2019s oil exports have huge potential to increase. Libya was pumping about 1.6m barrels of oil a day before the civil war that ended Colonel Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s rule in 2011. Production has since slumped to as low as 400,000 barrels a day, although it could be increased if the security situation in Libya improves. Glencore regularly invests in countries where security risks and political turmoil have deterred other investors, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Colombia. However, the company is in need of new sources of income, after the economic slowdown in China prompted a slump in global commodity prices, ravaging its share price. The company floated its shares at \u00a35.30 in 2011 but they have since plunged, closing on Monday at 90.42p. The firm announced proposals earlier this year to raise \u00a36.6bn in an effort to allay investors\u2019 fears about its \u00a320bn debt pile. The plan includes mine closures, asset sales and a \u00a31.6bn share-placing but has yet to arrest the decline in Glencore\u2019s stock. Glencore declined to comment on its dealings in Libya.",

    "webTitle": "British Airways chief: build toll roads to help foot 'outrageous' Heathrow bill", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Toll roads should be introduced around Heathrow to help pay for the costs of building a third runway, according to the boss of British Airways\u2019 owner, IAG. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, which operates around half the flights at Heathrow, said he would favour the idea as a way of funding the infrastructure, as he condemned the price tag of a third runway as \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201coverinflated\u201d. Speaking at the Airport Operators Association conference in London, Walsh said toll roads had worked in other countries, and it was fair that the user paid. Improved road and rail links to a bigger Heathrow are expected to add at least \u00a35bn to the \u00a317.6bn bill and the question of whether the airport or government pays has been left open by the Airports Commission. The M4 motorway will be widened, and the M25 will be tunnelled under the new third runway, should the government endorse the commission\u2019s recommendation. Walsh said: \u201cI think there are times the government should pay and there are times when there is another way. I don\u2019t mind tolled highways; I don\u2019t mind tolled motorways if they are efficient. It works in other countries. \u201cThe road network in Ireland is superior to the UK today. It used to be dreadful \u2026 But Ireland invested in major infrastructure projects, some of it funded by the EU, some of it funded by private equity and the cost of that is borne by the consumer. If you get a benefit I don\u2019t see why you shouldn\u2019t be prepared to pay.\u201d Heathrow has indicated that it expects the government to pay for improved road and rail links to the airport should its expansion plans go ahead. Walsh accused the commission of \u201cgetting its figures wrong\u201d in putting the costs of Heathrow expansion and the subsequent charges to be levied on airlines, at around \u00a329 per passenger, making it one of the most expensive airports in the world. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the [airline] industry can afford it. We believe it is outrageous. We can\u2019t see how it can be justified and certainly we would not be prepared to pay or support the development. There is no point having infrastructure if people won\u2019t use it because it\u2019s too expensive. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t pay if the figures in the Davies report are realistic \u2013 which I don\u2019t believe they are. The economic arguments only stack up if it\u2019s built efficiently and in a cost-effective way. \u201cIf that is the bill it has no prospect of success.\u201d He questioned why the new Terminal 6 was being priced far higher than Terminal 5, asking: \u201cHow many chandeliers can you have in a terminal?\u201d Gatwick has also questioned some of the methodology and figures in the Davies report, as the Sussex airport tries to persuade the government to back its own runway plans instead of the commission\u2019s recommendation to expand Heathrow. Despite his qualms with the costs, Walsh said that choosing Heathrow was the \u201cobvious\u201d answer, and reiterated his belief that \u201cwe don\u2019t have enough runways. We will at some stage face a major problem in the south-east.\u201d He also warned that a proposed ban on night flights as a condition for expansion would have a significant economic impact: \u201cMost are coming in from far away \u2026 the problem is when you look at the other end of the route. You can\u2019t just export our noise problems. We need to be serious about that.\u201d The government has promised to give a formal response in December to the commission\u2019s report, which in July gave a \u201cclear and unanimous\u201d backing for a third runway at Heathrow.",

The M4 motorway will be widened, and the M25 will be tunnelled under the new third runway, should the government endorse the commission\u2019s recommendation.<br></p> <p>Walsh said: \u201cI think there are times the government should pay and there are times when there is another way. I don\u2019t mind tolled highways; I don\u2019t mind tolled motorways if they are efficient. It works in other countries. </p> <p>\u201cThe road network in Ireland is superior to the UK today. It used to be dreadful \u2026 But Ireland invested in major infrastructure projects, some of it funded by the EU, some of it funded by private equity and the cost of that is borne by the consumer. If you get a benefit I don\u2019t see why you shouldn\u2019t be prepared to pay.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/01/heathrow-new-runway-airports-commission\">Heathrow's connectivity and size gives it trump card for new runway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Heathrow has indicated that it expects the government to pay for improved road and rail links to the airport should its expansion plans go ahead.</p> <p>Walsh accused the commission of \u201cgetting its figures wrong\u201d in putting the costs of Heathrow expansion and the subsequent charges to be levied on airlines, at around \u00a329 per passenger, making it one of the most expensive airports in the world. </p> <p>He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the [airline] industry can afford it. We believe it is outrageous. We can\u2019t see how it can be justified and certainly we would not be prepared to pay or support the development. There is no point having infrastructure if people won\u2019t use it because it\u2019s too expensive. </p> <p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t pay if the figures in the Davies report are realistic \u2013 which I don\u2019t believe they are. The economic arguments only stack up if it\u2019s built efficiently and in a cost-effective way.</p> <p>\u201cIf that is the bill it has no prospect of success.\u201d</p> <p>He questioned why the new Terminal 6 was being priced far higher than Terminal 5, asking: \u201cHow many chandeliers can you have in a terminal?\u201d</p> <p>Gatwick has also questioned some of the methodology and figures in the Davies report, as the Sussex airport tries to persuade the government to back its own runway plans instead of the commission\u2019s recommendation to expand Heathrow.</p> <p>Despite his qualms with the costs, Walsh said that choosing Heathrow was the \u201cobvious\u201d answer, and reiterated his belief that \u201cwe don\u2019t have enough runways. We will at some stage face a major problem in the south-east.\u201d </p> <p>He also warned that a proposed ban on night flights as a condition for expansion would have a significant economic impact: \u201cMost are coming in from far away \u2026 the problem is when you look at the other end of the route. You can\u2019t just export our noise problems. We need to be serious about that.\u201d </p> <p>The government has promised to give a formal response in December to the commission\u2019s report, which in July gave a \u201cclear and unanimous\u201d backing for a third runway at Heathrow. </p>",

      "bodyText": "US drugs giant Pfizer is merging with Irish-headquartered Allergan in a record-breaking $155bn (\u00a3100bn) deal. It is the largest so-called tax inversion move to date, and will bring huge tax savings to Pfizer as it shifts its headquarters from the US to tax-light Ireland. What is a tax inversion? It is a piece of financial engineering that multinational companies, particularly from the US, have turned to in order to reduce their tax bill. In a tax inversion, one company buys a rival based in a different country with a less onerous tax policy. It then \u201creincorporates\u201d by shifting the address of its headquarters to the country with the lighter tax burden. In many cases the operational HQ \u2013 the main business \u2013 might remain in the original country, but the firm simply holds some of its board meetings in the new jurisdiction. Why do US firms do it? The main reason is that the corporation tax regime in the US is the most demanding among developed economies. American firms are taxed on their domestic earnings at up to 39%, and also on income repatriated from foreign subsidiaries. For example, a US firm with a subsidiary based in Dublin pays the 12.5% headline rate of corporation tax in Ireland. The US taxman then levies a 26.5% rate on earnings from that subsidiary that flow back to America. That means the company\u2019s overall tax bill has effectively been topped up to the domestic rate of up to 39%. Most other countries impose a much lower rate than the US on repatriated earnings. If a company can shift its country of incorporation, the US taxman loses the right to take a slice of income from foreign subsidiaries. This system has led American firms to stash an estimated $2tn (\u00a31.32tn) overseas, rather than repatriate the money. It is also seen as a key motivation behind most tax inversions. Why are they unpopular? There is an argument that some US firms are buying smaller European rivals simply in order to reduce their tax bill, rather than because of any long-term strategic rationale for the takeover. President Obama has called such companies \u201ccorporate deserters\u201d who are being \u201cunpatriotic\u201d by seeking to reduce their contribution to US coffers. For the most part, though, US politicians have been happy enough for companies to buy foreign firms when the deal makes obvious sense, even if the end result is a lower tax bill. What many object to is an artificial takeover designed purely to avoid tax. This was the take of the US treasury secretary, Jack Lew, in an editorial written for the Washington Post: \u201cThere is nothing wrong with cross-border merger activity; our economy is stronger for our investment overseas and for foreign investment in the United States. But these activities should be based on economic efficiency, not tax savings.\u201d What is Pfizer doing? US pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer, the company behind Viagra and Xanax, has agreed a $155bn merger with Allergan, headquartered in notoriously tax-light Ireland. The company said this will slash its tax rate from 25% in 2014 to as low as 17% in the first year of the deal. Aren\u2019t there rules against tax inversions? There are but they won\u2019t stop Pfizer from going ahead. Obama\u2019s Treasury department last week introduced new measures designed to clamp down on tax inversions. These put tighter restrictions on inversions where the US company ends up with a combined stake of between 60% and 80% of the foreign takeover target. This was intended to stop firms buying much smaller foreign rivals simply to switch addresses to a country with a lower tax rate. But the terms of the Pfizer-Allergan means the US firm will own 56% of the new company. That puts it just below the threshold at which the tax inversion could be blocked. Is there a precedent? Pfizer tried a tax inversion last year by buying British pharmaceuticals rival AstraZeneca in a deal that would have cut its tax rate from 27% to 21%. The deal eventually collapsed amid uncertainty about White House plans to crack down on tax inversions. How old is this tactic? The first major inversion took place in 1982, when New Orleans construction firm McDermott upped sticks to Panama, switching its corporate headquarters to the Central American country and slashing the tax rate on its earnings. After a wave of similar deals, the US cracked down in 2004 with an anti-inversion law targeted at firms relocating to tax havens. However, it still permitted the company to change address, as long as its merger partner was a quarter of its size or larger. That ruled out moves to tiny tax havens where subsidiaries were unlikely to be big enough to satisfy this criterion. However, it also made a more attractive destination of Europe, where there are many firms large enough to bypass anti-inversion laws.",

The Swedish homeware company racked up revenues of nearly \u00a31.6bn in the year to the end of August, 11.3% more than the previous year. It also took a bigger slice of the UK market, up 0.5% to 7.7%, dealing a blow to John Lewis\u2019s hopes of knocking it off the top spot among home and furniture retailers. Ikea attributed some of the bounce to a range of new mattresses, sales of which were up by 30% over the year. It also enjoyed an 11% bump in the sale of Swedish food products, including its well-known meatballs and its recently introduced veggie balls. An effort to appeal to people on a tight budget saw the company invest \u00a327m in price cuts, a strategy it said had paid off. The biggest single price cut last year was on the Friheten corner sofa-bed, which became the year\u2019s best seller after it was reduced from \u00a3445 to \u00a3395. Sales through its website, which will be overhauled next year, were up by nearly 30%, compared to in-store sales that increased by 9%. Ikea\u2019s UK boss, Gillian Drakeford, said a fourth consecutive year of sales growth would allow Ikea to press on with expansion plans. She said: \u201cThis puts us in a great position to continue to grow Ikea\u2019s physical presence in the UK.\u201d The Swedish firm will open its first new major store for seven years in Reading next summer and has also launched a trial of smaller \u201cclick and collect\u201d stores, the first of which opened in Norwich this month. A second is due to open in Aberdeen next spring, while the company has also explored the possibility of moving into the BHS building on London\u2019s Oxford Street. Rising sales in the UK mirrored a broader increase in the group\u2019s worldwide revenues, which it said earlier this year were up 5% to \u20ac32bn (\u00a322.5bn). Ikea is pushing towards a revenue target of \u20ac50bn by 2020, with much of its growth fuelled by new stores in China and Russia. Ikea won praise earlier this year when it became the first large national retailer to commit to paying staff the Living Wage of \u00a39.15 an hour in London and \u00a37.85 across the UK from April.",

      "bodyText": "Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Allergan have announced a record-breaking $155bn (\u00a3100bn) deal that looks sure to prompt an international row over corporate tax avoidance. The deal, which would create the world\u2019s biggest drugmaker by sales, is the latest in a series of takeovers in which a US company effectively relocates its headquarters overseas to exploit another country\u2019s lower corporate tax regime \u2013 a process known as tax inversion. It was immediately condemned by Democrat presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Sanders called it \u201ca disaster\u201d. Viagra-maker Pfizer, one of the top names in corporate America, would be based in Ireland, where Allergan is headquartered, should the deal be approved. Effectively, Pfizer is pursuing a reverse takeover of Allergan, which makes Botox, with the smaller company buying New York-based Pfizer. After the sale, the combined company will be renamed Pfizer PLC and continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Pfizer\u2019s current tax rate is about 25% and would drop below 20% in Ireland, analysts estimate. Inversions will cost the US taxpayer $19.5bn over the next 10 years, according to Congress\u2019s joint committee on taxation. Pfizer is joining a growing number of big US companies now officially based overseas for tax purposes including Burger King (Canada) and Chiquita Brands (Ireland), which have used reverse takeovers to cut their tax bills. The long-rumoured deal is likely to come under intense political pressure. The US president, Barack Obama, has called inversions \u201cunpatriotic,\u201d while Clinton and Sanders have both previously criticised the proposed Pfizer deal, as well as high drug prices. \u201cThis merger would be a disaster for Americans who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\u201d Sanders posted on Twitter after the news broke. Clinton opposes tax inversions and would call on regulators to crack down. \u201cWe cannot delay in cracking down on inversions that erode our tax base,\u201d she said in a statement on Monday. Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the Republican field, and rival Marco Rubio have blamed the US tax code for inversions and pledged to cut US corporate tax rates to stop them. Ian Read, Pfizer\u2019s Scottish chief executive, told the Wall Street Journal last month that the US\u2019s high tax rates meant Pfizer was competing \u201cwith one hand tied behind our back\u201d. He said he had tried and failed to lobby for tax reform in Washington. Anders Dahlbeck, tax justice policy adviser of non-governmental organisation ActionAid, said: \u201cThis is just the latest example of a multinational company exploiting the global race to the bottom on corporate tax rates to avoid paying their fair share. \u201cThis is part of a global problem with huge impacts on the lives of people living in poverty. Poor countries are blighted by tax avoidance, with the International Monetary Fund estimating that they lose $200bn per year to tax avoidance. \u201cIf the scourge of global poverty is to be tackled, governments must listen to the public and take bold action to tackle tax avoidance and ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax wherever they operate.\u201d The announcement comes as the US Treasury tries to block such deals. Earlier this month, it announced new rules designed to make it harder for a US company to buy a foreign company and relocate the combined entity\u2019s address. The department has yet to comment on how the proposed rules would affect the Pfizer-Allergan deal. Jack Lew, the US Treasury secretary, recently told CNBC: \u201cUS companies are currently taking advantage of an environment that allows them to move their tax residence overseas to avoid paying taxes in the US, without making significant changes in the nature of their overall operations. \u201cWhile we intend to take additional action in the coming months, there is only so much the Treasury department can do to prevent these tax-avoidance transactions,\u201d said Lew. \u201cOnly legislation can decisively stop inversions.\u201d But corporate experts are doubtful that significant change is coming. \u201cThis is an issue people shout about and then forget about. We see it each time one of these inversions is announced,\u201d said Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University. \u201cThis could be a campaign issue, but really what are they going to do? Get legislation through Congress? They can\u2019t even pass a budget.\u201d The alternative, he said, was to push for tax reforms to ensure corporations stay in the US. \u201cBut tax breaks for corporations is not a platform I\u2019d run on,\u201d he said. Last year, the UK\u2019s AstraZeneca rejected a $119bn merger proposal from Pfizer. The bid attracted criticism from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic as well as AstraZeneca\u2019s board and unions, who were concerned about job cuts. Under the terms of the Allergan deal, the companies will exchange 11.3 Pfizer shares for every Allergan share. The deal also contains a cash component of between $6bn and $12bn. \u201cThe proposed combination of Pfizer and Allergan will create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world,\u201d said Read. \u201cThe combination of Allergan and Pfizer is a highly strategic, value-enhancing transaction that brings together two biopharma powerhouses to change lives for the better,\u201d said Brent Saunders, Allergan\u2019s chief executive. The companies said the deal represents a roughly 30% premium to Allergan\u2019s closing price on 28 October, the day the Wall Street Journal reported the companies were in talks.

      "bodyText": "Klaus Regling, who runs the eurozone\u2019s bailout mechanism (the ESM) has confirmed that Greece has done enough to qualify for a new loan: \u201cToday\u2019s decision to disburse \u20ac2 billion of ESM funds reflects the Greek government\u2019s commitment to the programme as it implemented an extensive list of essential reforms. These include key financial sector reforms which are important to support the ongoing bank recapitalisation process. If programme implementation remains strong, I am confident that the Greek people\u2019s reform efforts will allow them to make visible strides towards a sound recovery\u201d.  This disbursement is several weeks late, though, following a row over implementing tougher rules on home repossessions (or foreclosures). That has worried some analysts, who fear that Athens may struggle to stick to the deal. Still, \u20ac2bn shouldn\u2019t be sniffed at. It\u2019s official... Greece is getting its next aid tranche, worth \u20ac2bn. Time for a recap. Growth across French companies has weakened this month, after the Paris terror attacks. But firms remain optimistic about long-term prospects. Growth across the wider eurozone private sector has hit its fastest rate since 2011. Peripheral countries are now growing faster than France or Germany. But US factories have reported a slowdown. A fall in exports shows that America is being hurt by problems in emerging markets. Drugs giant Pfizer is shifting its tax base to Ireland in a controversial \u2018inversion\u2019. The company is taking over rival Allergan in a $160bn deal. The copper price has hit a new 6.5 year low. Traders blamed concerns over China\u2019s slowdown and the strong US dollar. But oil has recovered from its early losses. A statement from the Saudi cabinet, pledging to work with other producers, has spurred talk that OPEC might cut production. And eurozone finance ministers holding a Eurogroup meeting. On the agenda: 2016 budget plans, the Paris terror attacks and Greece\u2019s bailout. Ouch! Growth in America\u2019s manufacturing sector has unexpectedly fallen to a two-year low this month. Markit\u2019s US flash PMI index has dropped to 52.6 in November, a chunky fall compared to October\u2019s 54.1. It\u2019s the weakest reading since October 2013 (but still over the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction). US firms reported that output and new orders has slowed this month, meaning they took on new staff at a slower rate. Worryingly, export sales fell. Chief economist Chris Willliamson says the report shows US factories lost momentum last month:\uf0a7 Domestic demand appears to be holding up well, but the sluggish global economy and strong dollar continue to act as dampeners on firms\u2019 order book growth. Export orders showed a renewed decline, dropping for the first time in three months. But the sector is still growing, meaning the Federal Reserve could still raise interest rates next month. A few photos from inside today\u2019s eurogroup meeting have arrived: As regular readers know, eurogroup meetings this year have been dominated by the Greek crisis (and boy, there were a LOT of meetings). But as Finand\u2019s finance chief tweets, the agenda has changed: Greece, though, is hoping to get its \u20ac2bn aid payment signed off today - after agreeing various austerity measures last week. Ireland\u2019s finance minister Michael Noonan has arrived at the eurogroup meeting. He insists that Dublin didn\u2019t encourage Pfizer to shift its tax base to Ireland through its huge merger with Allergan. They are \u201cobviously doing it for tax advantages\u2026\u2026 but we are not pushing for inversion\u201d, Noonan says. \u201cIt\u2019s a decision by the two companies.\u201d Our priority is to ensure there are no job losses, and that jobs are created, he adds. Jeroen Dijsselbloem has added that Brussels doesn\u2019t have any immediate concerns about the cost of addressing the current security crisis in France. The priority today is to show our solidarity with the French, and also Belgium after its weekend security clampdown. It\u2019s too early to say whether France\u2019s decision to increase defence and security spending will interfere with its fiscal targets, Dijsselbloem tells reporters at today\u2019s Eurogroup session. Dijsselbloem points out that countries facing \u2018exceptional conditions\u2019 can get extra leeway. At the moment, France is \u2018broadly compliant\u2019 with the EU\u2019s targets, he adds. (France is supposed to bring its deficit below 3% of GDP by 2017, but president Hollande and prime minister Valls have already hinted that this target will be missed, as Paris bolsters its security) Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has also arrived at today\u2019s meeting. He confirms that Portugal has still not submitted a 2016 budget for inspection by eurocrats in Brussels: We hope that they will send one in very soon....either this government, or the next. Q: Portugal may soon have a new government, made up of socialists and communists. iIll that be a problem? Dijsselbloem says: I can\u2019t speculate....but either way. Portugal must send in a budget as soon as possible. If that\u2019s from a new government, that\u2019s also fine. Finance ministers are arriving in Brussels now for today\u2019s eurogroup meeting. There\u2019s a live feed here. Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb just spoke to reporters. He says he\u2019s not concerned that Portugal hasn\u2019t submitted a budget yet....we must wait for a \u201cresponsible government\u201d to be formed. [Portugal\u2019s centre-right government lost a confidence vote this month, but the president appears reluctant to appoint a socialist replacement]. Stubb (a conservative) adds that it\u2019s not his job to appoint the Portuguese government. But he hints that he\u2019d like his fellow right-wingers to retain power; citing the \u201cabsolutely fantastic\u201d co-operation he\u2019s enjoyed with Portugal\u2019s finance minister, Maria Lu\u00eds Albuquerque. Q: Could this meeting be a chance to say goodbye? I hope not, Stubb replies firmly. The French stock market is under-performing the rest of Europe today, after this morning\u2019s PMI report showed growth in France\u2019s service sector is slowing. The CAC index, which includes the 40 biggest listed companies in Paris, has lost 0.7%. Italy\u2019s market is higher, though, after Markit reported that the eurozone periphery was outperforming France and Germany this month (see earlier chart). Mining stocks are still dragging the London market down, with the strong dollar weighing on the commodity market. The oil price has just rebounded from this morning\u2019s lows, thanks to a new statement from Saudi Arabia. The rally was triggered by a news report from the Saudi cabinet, which said the Kingdom remains keen to work with fellow oil producers and exporter to ensure the stability of the oil market. Traders may be calculating that Saudi is prepared to cut production to push up the oil price - although the actual statement seems slightly vague:... The Pfizer-Allergan merger isn\u2019t all about tax, apparently (perish the thought!!)..... Pfizer chief executive Ian Read says: \u201cThe proposed combination of Pfizer and Allergan will create a leading global pharmaceutical company with the strength to research, discover and deliver more medicines and therapies to more people around the world.\u201d Here\u2019s Rob Davies\u2019s story on the deal: The biggest deal in pharmaceutical history has just been confirmed. Viagra-maker Pfizer will merge with Allergan, the firm behind Botox, in a deal that values Allergan at around $150bn (or \u00a3100bn). The combined company will keep its HQ in New York, but have its \u201cprinciple executive offices\u201d in Dublin. That\u2019s would allow Pfizer to shift its tax domicile from the US to Ireland, and benefit from the country\u2019s lower corporation tax rates. Such tax inversion deals are awfully unpopular in Washington, as politicians fume at the sight of US companies avoiding paying their fair share. As Ed Pilkington reported last night: The pending fusion of the companies would be the largest so-called \u201cinversion\u201d yet, whereby corporations on paper relocate their headquarters to more favorable tax environments by appearing to be bought by much smaller entities. It comes at precisely the moment the US treasury is attempting to block such deals. Treasury secretary Jack Lew said over the weekend: \u201cUS companies are currently taking advantage of an environment that allows them to move their tax residence overseas to avoid paying taxes in the US, without making significant changes in the nature of their overall operations.\u201d Today\u2019s PMI report may not deter the European Central Bank from launching new stimulus measures in December. Although activity is rising, companies also reported that the prices they pay for goods and services fell marginally this month. That suggests Timo del Carpio, European economist at RBC Capital Markets, says this shows inflationary pressures are \u201cstubbornly static\u201d: Activity looks to have accelerated in November, with the sectoral level breakdown also looking somewhat more balanced this time around. However, despite signs of overall activity remaining robust, inflationary pressures still appear stubbornly subdued at this stage of the recovery cycle. As such, the pressure on the ECB Governing Council to act looks to us to remain fully in place going into their final meeting of the year. Back in the City, traders are piling into Home Retail Group, the company behind Argos and Homebase. Shares in Home Retail Group have jumped over 6% today, making it the top riser on the FTSE 250 index. This follows reports that private equity firms are taking an interest, after the company posted a profit warning last month that send shares sliding. Eurozone finance ministers will be pleased to hear that European businesses are growing at the fastest rate since 2011, as they gather for today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. They\u2019re still expected to meet in Brussels this afternoon, despite the security clampdown in the Belgian capital. On the agenda: the draft 2016 budgets submitted by eurozone members. Austria, Lithuania, Italy and Spain have already been warned that their plans risk breaking EU rules. However, the cost of dealing with the refugee crisis should force Brussels to offer more leeway. Ministers will also discuss Greece. On Saturday, eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem declared that Athens has (finally) hit the first set of milestones under its new bailout, which should unlock aid payments. Statement by the President of Eurogroup on Greece Today\u2019s report also showed that Europe\u2019s factories are lagging behind service sector firms: That reflects the weakness in the global economy, which has left Europe more reliant on domestic demand. The slowdown in France this month means the gap with other eurozone neighbours has widened: Business expectations in the French service sector remain subdued. Markit reports: While some firms cited the securing of major contracts and launch of new services as factors likely to support activity growth over the next 12 months, others pointed to a drop in confidence following the Paris attacks. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says today\u2019s PMI report shows the eurozone economy is picking up pace: \u201cThe PMI shows a welcome acceleration of eurozone growth, putting the region on course for one of its best quarterly performances over the past four-and-a-half years. The data are signalling GDP growth of 0.4% in the closing quarter of the year, with 0.5% in sight if we get even just a modest uptick in December. That would be an improvement on the third quarter of 2015, when GDP rose by just 0.3% Williamson adds: \u201cThe improved performance in terms of economic growth and job creation seen in November are all the more impressive given last weekend\u2019s tragic events in Paris, which subdued economic activity in France \u2013 especially in the service sector. Growth across the eurozone private sector has hit its highest level since May 2011, despite France\u2019s weakness. Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck of the sector, the eurozone PMI, rose from 53.9 in October to 54.4 this month. The strongest growth was seen in the eurozone periphery, rather than its biggest two economies. Service sector growth outpaced factories, as Markit explains: The recovery continued to be led by the service sector, where business activity and new business rose at the fastest rates since May 2011 and employment showed the biggest monthly gain for five years. Manufacturing output growth meanwhile also gathered pace, reaching a three-month high amid the largest monthly improvement in order books since April of last year. Economists are cheered by the acceleration in Germany\u2019s private sector this month: German firms are ending the year on the front foot, with growth hitting a three-month high. Markit\u2019s Flash Germany Composite Output Index has come in at 54.9, up from 54.2 in October. That\u2019s the strongest reading since August. Germany\u2019s service sector outpaced its factories, as this chart shows: We have the first concrete sign that this month\u2019s terror attacks in Paris have caused some economic damage. Growth across France\u2019s private sector has hit its lowest level in three months, according to Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck of the sector. Its Flash France Composite Output Index, which measures activity at manufacturing and services firms, dropped to 51.3 from 52.6 in October. Any reading over 50 shows growth. The slowdown suggests French restaurants, hotels, and retailers have seen a dip in trade after the atrocities which rocked the capital 10 days ago. Encouragingly, French firms also reported a rise in new orders, suggesting the economy won\u2019t be badly hit. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, explains: \u201cFrench private sector output growth weakened slightly in November, with the Paris attacks reported to have hit activity among some service providers. However, the trend in new business firmed a little, with growth quickening to a five-month high, while backlogs of work rose again. While the longer-term economic impact following the attacks remains uncertain, PMI data suggest that GDP is on course to post another modest expansion in Q4 following the 0.3% growth reported in the third quarter. Shares in mining giants are being hit hard this morning, matching the rout in the metals market. Commodity giants such as Glencore, Anglo American and BHP Billiton are leading the selloff: That\u2019s pulled the FTSE 100 down by 52 points, or almost 0.9%, to 6281 points. Glencore\u2019s shares are now 30% below their level in September, when it tapped shareholders for new funds. Iran\u2019s oil minister has helped to weaken the oil price today, by declaring that his country will boost its own production levels once Western sanctions are eased. Bijan Zanganeh told reporters that: \u201cTo increase Iran\u2019s oil production in the global market after the lifting of sanctions, we don\u2019t need permission from OPEC or any other organisation.\u201d Zanganeh also predicted that OPEC will not change its output policy when it meets next month. Oil is also on the slide this morning. The price of a barrel of US crude has dropped almost 3% to below $40.70, a drop of $1.20. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, is down 1.8% at $43.84 Traders are blaming supply glut worries, especially if oil cartel OPEC decides to leave production unchanged. It holds its next meeting on December 4th, and may decide to leave production levels unchanged. Copper has hit a new six-year low this morning as the rout in the commodities sector deepens. The strengthening US dollar, and fears of weaker demand for China, are hitting metals and energy prices. London copper, the benchmark measure, slumped to just $4,444 this morning, a fall of over 2.5%. That\u2019s its lowest level since early 2009 - when the world economy was gripped by a post-Lehman Brothers recession. Other metals, such as Zinc and nickel, are also falling this morning. Analysts are citing China as a key factor. Overnight, the Peoples\u2019 Bank of China (PBOC) fixed the yuan at its lowest level against the US dollar since August. That suggests it is worried that the economy is weakening. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... The looming prospect of a US rate rise is moving the markets this morning. The dollar is strengthening, as investors anticipate a hike at next month\u2019s meeting. Alastair Winter, chief economist at City firm Daniel Stewart, reckons the first rate hike since 2006 is in the bag: The minutes from the last meeting at the end of October together with a barrage of speeches from across the whole spectrum of hawks and doves have made it almost certain that the FOMC will hike in December. He predicts a \u201cdovish hike\u201d - with one hike next month and an indefinite pause thereafter. But while the US faces higher borrowing costs, Europe is likely to need more stimulus soon. New surveys of how eurozone companies are performing this month are due today. Poor readings may strengthen the European Central Bank\u2019s determination to act. 8am GMT: French manufacturing and services PMI 8.30am GMT: German manufacturing and services PMI 9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing and services PMI Also coming up... Eurozone finance ministers are due to hold their latest eurogroup meeting today in Brussels. They\u2019ll be discussing the draft budgetary plans for 2016 of euro area member states, on the basis of the European Commission\u2019s opinions. Last week, the EC warned that Italy, Lithuania, Austria and Spain all risk breaking EU rules, so it could be a tense meeting. And we\u2019ll also be watching Volkswagen, following reports that the diesel emissions scandal is now hitting sales.",

Debenhams wants a reduction of between 1-2% in suppliers\u2019 prices in exchange for making payments 30 to 60 days earlier. It is the second time in three years that the retailer has proposed changes to suppliers\u2019 terms in the run-up to Christmas. The federation accused Debenhams of poor payment practice. \u201cBusinesses have a responsibility to pay their suppliers in a timely fashion,\u201d said Mike Cherry, FSB national policy director. \u201cLarge firms should not be permitted to award themselves an automatic discount for doing what they should - pay on time.\u201d \u201cSmaller suppliers faced with unreasonable terms should seek to check if customers are signatories to the prompt payment code and if so \u2013 to make a complaint. In future they should seek to report this to the government-proposed small business commissioner.\u201d Debenhams said it was making its proposal in response to requests from some of its suppliers for earlier payment terms. It said the change in arrangements was entirely optional. \u201cThe scheme is entirely optional as was made clear in our communication to our suppliers, and is intended to help their cashflow at peak periods,\u201d said Debenhams. \u200e\u201cThe offer has been welcomed and we continue to maintain strong relationships with our suppliers.\u201d The move comes two years after the department store chain demanded a 2.5% discount eight days before Christmas in a move that was dubbed the \u201cSanta tax\u201d. The retailer\u2019s finance director at the time, Simon Herrick, was criticised for the move and later left the business. Debenhams chief executive, Michael Sharp, recently announced he was stepping down from the group after five years at the helm after reports of shareholder unrest. \u201cWe are concerned and disappointed by this latest example of poor payment practices from Debenhams,\u201d said the federation\u2019s Mike Cherry. \u201cSadly it is not the first time we have seen the retail giant behave in this way and would have hoped that by now, it would have improved its behaviour. \u201cIt is simply unacceptable for any company to exploit its market position to enforce unfair and unreasonable payment terms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time to put a stop to big businesses using their size and power to force small firms to accept late payment, excessively long payment terms, or demand automatic discounts simply for paying on time.\u201d \u2022This article has been amended.

      "bodyText": "The first snapshot of French business mood since the Paris attacks points to a slowdown in economic activity, with companies in the service sector reporting a blow to trade and confidence. A wide-ranging poll of French companies signalled that private sector output grew in November, but at the slowest pace for three months. Some companies in the services sector, which includes hotels and restaurants, said the gun and suicide bomb attacks on the French capital had dented trade. That pressure combined with a slowdown in manufacturing and pushed the headline reading on the Markit Flash France PMI report down to 51.3 from 52.6 a month earlier. It was still above the 50-mark separating growth in output from contraction but signalled a slower pace of expansion. The \u201cflash\u201d measure is an estimate based on 85% of replies and will be updated in December. The survey compilers, who polled companies between 12 and 20 November, said the attacks on 13 November were cited by some services companies as they reported a drop in confidence. Those signals echo moves on stock markets, where shares in travel-related companies and in luxury retailers were knocked by fears that people would cut back holiday plans. But economists say that overall the attacks are unlikely to have a significant effect on France\u2019s economy. The PMI report\u2019s compilers said the French economy still looked like it would have continued to expand in the final three months of this year. \u201cFrench private sector output growth weakened slightly in November, with the Paris attacks reported to have hit activity among some service providers,\u201d said Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit. \u201cWhile the longer-term economic impact following the attacks remains uncertain, PMI data suggest that GDP is on course to post another modest expansion in the fourth quarter following the 0.3% growth reported in the third quarter.\u201d The survey showed both manufacturers and services sector companies reported weaker growth in activity in November. But new business picked up. Services companies reported the fastest rise in new business for five months. Manufacturers indicated the fastest growth in new orders since April 2014, with domestic demand making up for a drop in export orders. Business expectations in the French service sector showed little change in the latest month, remaining subdued relative to the survey\u2019s historical trend, the report said. \u201cWhile some firms cited the securing of major contracts and launch of new services as factors likely to support activity growth over the next 12 months, others pointed to a drop in confidence following the Paris attacks,\u201d it added. A PMI report covering the wider eurozone suggested economic growth there picked up in the latest month. Businesses in the single currency bloc reported the fastest growth in business activity and employment for four-and-a-half years. \u201cThe improved performance in terms of economic growth and job creation seen in November are all the more impressive given last weekend\u2019s tragic events in Paris, which subdued economic activity in France \u2013 especially in the service sector,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.",

      "bodyText": "In a few weeks\u2019 time world leaders will have the opportunity to usher in a new era of multilateral cooperation on climate change. This starts with the UN climate change conference in Paris, but it does not end there. Building momentum to tackle climate change is a common challenge for us all \u2013 individually and institutionally. The broader international community, including the WTO, has to play its part. Like most economic activity, trade is often linked to carbon emissions, but the world cannot stop trading \u2013 not least as trade is essential in achieving many other shared goals. Trade can help to improve the efficiency of production, it can improve food security and, above all, it has proven to be one of the best anti-poverty tools in history. Trade played a key role in helping us reach the millennium development goal to cut extreme poverty by half \u2013 and it is a cross-cutting element in many of the new sustainable development goals agreed at the UN in September, so this work will continue. The challenge is not to stop trading but to ensure that trade is an ally in the fight against climate change. We need to create a virtuous circle of trade and environmental policies which promote sustainable production and consumption while being pro-growth and development. It is just over 20 years since the signing of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 \u2013 and it is exactly 20 years since the WTO was created. The world has witnessed a profound transformation in the debate on trade and the environment since then \u2013 and a degree of convergence between the two. While international trade flows have increased dramatically over this period, the green economy has been built into business models and investment in renewable energy has been mainstreamed. Standards and technical regulations, which are so vital for the functioning of markets and trade, have followed suit with strengthened environmental requirements. So how can we ensure that trade policy plays its full part in future? First, we must improve the dissemination of and access to climate-friendly technologies, goods and services which support the transition towards a low carbon economy. In some countries, import tariffs on products such as solar water heaters are over 20%, and wind turbines over 15% \u2013 much higher than the average tariff of 9%. Making environmental goods and services cheaper and more accessible would help countries to leapfrog outmoded technologies and move quickly to apply climate-friendly alternatives. A group of WTO members, who account for the majority of global trade in environmental goods, are negotiating an environmental goods agreement to lower their trade barriers on a number of important environmental products. Success here would help to disseminate cutting-edge technologies, such as those identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), at much lower costs while also stimulating innovation and strengthening the green economy around the world. Although these tariff reductions are being taken forward by a group of WTO members, the benefits would apply to the whole WTO membership. Second, we can make trade more efficient overall. Trade is often linked to carbon emissions \u2013 particularly through international transportation. Although 80% of trade volume utilises sea transport which has the lowest level of emissions of any form of transport, there is scope to do more. The International Maritime Organisation and the International Civil Aviation Organisation are working to find a global solution to emissions in the maritime and aviation sectors \u2013 and we should support these efforts. By streamlining customs processes, we also can reduce some transport emissions and cut the energy required to keep perishable goods fresh while they wait to cross the border. The WTO\u2019s trade facilitation agreement will deliver this while also helping businesses to grow \u2013 green businesses included \u2013 and reducing trading costs by over 14% on average, and more for the poorest countries. Associated with every environmental good is a dense value chain of other goods and services suppliers. A wind turbine, for instance, consists of more than 8,000 component parts. Cutting the time that it takes to move these parts across borders would lower costs and help make climate friendly technologies more available. I hope that green businesses will use this opportunity. The international community is facing a historic test. We must ensure that the trade, development and environmental agendas complement each other. I am optimistic that we will rise to the challenge.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne could be forced to borrow billions of pounds more than forecast by 2020 if he sticks with spending cuts that will hit economic growth, according to a report by City University. With only days to go before the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement, the report says the Treasury has underestimated the impact of welfare and departmental spending cuts on the broader economy and especially cuts to public sector investment. Without a boost to public infrastructure, private sector businesses will limit their own investment plans, leading to lower productivity and depressed GDP growth over the next four years. By 2020, the government will be forced to report a \u00a340bn deficit instead of the planned \u00a310bn surplus, the report concludes, undermining Osborne\u2019s fiscal charter, which dictates that governments borrow only in times of distress. The study by two academics from City University comes only days before the chancellor is expected to tell parliament that he plans to achieve a budget surplus by 2020 from a mixture of cuts to departmental spending and welfare and from higher tax receipts, especially income tax and national insurance. But he is already off track in 2015-16 after a run of poor figures for the public finances. Last week, the Office for National Statistics reported that higher government spending and lower corporation tax receipts than expected in October had sent borrowing to its highest for that month since 2009. Richard Murphy, an academic at City University who has advised the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the \u00a350bn gap in borrowing was likely because the Treasury would repeat the same mistakes it made between 2010 and 2015, when the coalition government borrowed \u00a3160bn more than predicted. He said the government planned to ignore a study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that showed cuts to public expenditure during the recovery from a financial crash can result in lower growth, depressed tax receipts and the need for higher borrowing. The analysis of the multiplier effect from spending cuts shows that far from allowing private consumption and investment to accelerate, it remains modest at best, limiting growth and tax receipts. Murphy said: \u201cThe very low multiplier the Treasury uses assumes that cuts in government spending will stimulate growth. That\u2019s an assumption, and not a fact. \u201cIt is one the IMF now disagree with. And the result of basing policy on that multiplier is we have more cuts than we need, lower growth in the UK economy as a result, lower earnings for most households and so lower tax revenues \u2013 which actually makes balancing the government\u2019s books harder,\u201d he added. The Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes forecasts based on Treasury spending plans, assume that the multiplier for every \u00a31 of public spending cuts is less than 70p for the economy as a whole. But the IMF study showed it could be as much as \u00a31.70 as private businesses recoiled from making long-term investment decisions while the government retrenched. Murphy pointed a report by the credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, which argued that every extra increase in public investment spending of 1% of GDP in one year would lead to a multiplier effect of two-and-a-half times over three years. \u201cWe also project that such investment would add more than 300,000 jobs in the same year as the increase occurred,\u201d said S&amp;P. Murphy said: \u201cThe fact that Osborne looks certain to already miss his 2015-16 forecast by some way just makes it clear that neither the Treasury or OBR seem to have learned the error of their ways and continue to impose austerity on the UK for wholly inappropriate reasons as a consequence.\u201d",

Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/20/worst-uk-deficit-figures-six-years-george-osborne\">the Office for National Statistics reported</a> that higher government spending and lower corporation tax receipts than expected in October had sent borrowing to its highest for that month since 2009.</p> <p>Richard Murphy, an academic at City University who has advised the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the \u00a350bn gap in borrowing was likely because the Treasury would repeat the same mistakes it made between 2010 and 2015, when the coalition government borrowed \u00a3160bn more than predicted.</p> <p>He said the government planned to ignore <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/13/imf-george-osborne-austerity-76bn\">a study by the International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) that showed cuts to public expenditure during the recovery from a financial crash can result in lower growth, depressed tax receipts and the need for higher borrowing.</p> <p>The analysis of the multiplier effect from spending cuts shows that far from allowing private consumption and investment to accelerate, it remains modest at best, limiting growth and tax receipts.</p> <p>Murphy said: \u201cThe very low multiplier the Treasury uses assumes that cuts in government spending will stimulate growth. That\u2019s an assumption, and not a fact. </p> <p>\u201cIt is one the IMF now disagree with. And the result of basing policy on that multiplier is we have more cuts than we need, lower growth in the UK economy as a result, lower earnings for most households and so lower tax revenues \u2013 which actually makes balancing the government\u2019s books harder,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes forecasts based on Treasury spending plans, assume that the multiplier for every \u00a31 of public spending cuts is less than 70p for the economy as a whole. But the IMF study showed it could be as much as \u00a31.70 as private businesses recoiled from making long-term investment decisions while the government retrenched.</p> <p>Murphy pointed a report by the credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, which argued that every extra increase in public investment spending of 1% of GDP in one year would lead to a multiplier effect of two-and-a-half times over three years.</p> <p>\u201cWe also project that such investment would add more than 300,000 jobs in the same year as the increase occurred,\u201d said S&amp;P.</p> <p>Murphy said: \u201cThe fact that Osborne looks certain to already miss his 2015-16 forecast by some way just makes it clear that neither the Treasury or OBR seem to have learned the error of their ways and continue to impose austerity on the UK for wholly inappropriate reasons as a consequence.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The latest annual release of the state accounts on Friday shows Western Australia remains the strongest performing state. Robert F Kennedy famously said of gross national product that it \u201cmeasures everything ... except that which makes life worthwhile\u201d, the same might be said of gross state product (GSP). The breakdown of the figures shows strong economic growth does not always lead to things that are important in life \u2013 such as jobs. While Western Australia\u2019s economy in the 2014-15 financial year grew by 3.5%, it was not the fastest growing state or territory. Northern Territory grew by a stunning 10.5%. So strongly did it grow it needs its own graph because the 10.5% screws up the scale for all other states: The 10.5% growth is larger than any other state has achieved in the past 25 years \u2013 the best Western Australia has achieved in that period is 9.1% in 2011-12. But a bit of context is required \u2013 Northern Territory is the smallest economy in Australia. It accounts for just 1.4% of Australia\u2019s GDP. Western Australia by contrast is 10 times larger: It means a big investment in a mine in Northern Territory has a huge impact. In the past year, the territory saw a $2.03bn increase in non-dwelling construction \u2013 a 24% increase in current dollars. For comparison, a similar increase in WA would see just a 4.6% increase on investment in that state. But in the west it isn\u2019t the increase in mining construction that is powering the state, but exports. In the past year, exports of goods in WA contributed 4.26% to the growth of its economy, whereas the decline in private investment reduced the state\u2019s economic growth by 2.3%: In effect, in WA the growth of exports is overcoming the decline in investment. And it is producing a GSP growth still ahead of all the other states, if not as good as it was in the previous three years, nor in the years leading up to the GFC: The transition from the mining boom is certainly evident in the GSP figures, with New South Wales and Victoria having stronger growth than they have seen since 2010-11. On a per capita basis, Western Australia remains the strongest performer, and Tasmania is enjoying a period of growth it hasn\u2019t seen since 2007-08. On a per capita basis, as with the overall GSP growth figures, the worst performing state is Queensland. The figures certainly don\u2019t suggest members of the former Newman government, which was voted out earlier this year, have much to brag about. In per capita terms, Queensland\u2019s economy shrunk by 0.85% in 2014-15 \u2013 the only state to go backwards. Incidentally it is the only time in the past 25 years only one state has gone backwards \u2013 hardly a record worth setting. The figures highlight that Queensland, despite often being called a mining state, is a rather different economy to WA. Whereas in the west, the exports of goods were able to more than compensate for the decline in private investment, in Queensland they didn\u2019t come close. The fall in private investment reduced the growth of the state\u2019s economy by 4.8% but the exports of goods only added 0.8% to growth. Queensland has also been a nice example of how austerity has not helped fill the gap of falling private investment: Since 2012-13 at the same time that private sector investment was going backwards, state and local government capital spending has fallen. It adds up to Queensland having a very poor growth of state final demand \u2013 indeed in 2014-15 demand in Queensland fell by 3%. That was the second worst performance across Australia, only WA\u2019s fall of 3.5% was worse. And it is here where we see how strong economic growth that comes via exports can hide the picture of the weakness of the actual state\u2019s economy. In the past, talk of the economy doing well via strong exports suggested either agriculture or manufacturing wherein such strength also implied strong employment. When you hear of an Australian company exporting cars or various machinery you think of workers being employed to do so, but with the exporting of iron ore and other resources the main employment boom from building the mine and the various infrastructure supporting it has already occurred. It means WA\u2019s strong GSP growth has not translated to strong employment growth. The real employment driver is state final demand \u2013 which takes in household consumption, dwelling construction (both of which were strong in NSW), private investmentand public consumption and investment. It is not surprising the three states and territories with the strongest final demand growth are the three which have the strongest employment growth: The state accounts highlight Australia\u2019s changing economy. In the past, the link between economic growth and employment was quite close: strong economic growth invariably meant strong employment growth. But now there is somewhat of a disconnect between the two. If the economy is growing strongest off of mining exports, employment is likely to grow slower than otherwise would be expected. And it\u2019s why when we look at economic growth we need to focus not just on the overall number but what produces the overall growth. Because perhaps more so than in the past, GDP and GSP can be said to measure everything, except that which matters to people\u2019s lives.",

      "bodyText": "On a weekday morning in Blakelaw, two miles from the heart of Newcastle, the scene inside a community centre suggests a perfect example of what David Cameron used to call the \u201cbig society\u201d. Local women have gathered for a \u201ccoffee and conversation\u201d session, while people nearby are cutting flyers for a residents\u2019 association\u2019s Christmas fair. Meanwhile, an effervescent 36-year-old councillor called David Stockdale is discussing plans to bring a key amenity into community ownership. The prime minister would presumably balk at his terminology: Stockdale proudly talks about a \u201csocialist post office\u201d. Since March 2013, the Blakelaw neighbourhood centre has been run as a not-for-profit local partnership, raising money and rising to the challenges presented by austerity. When the library that extends off the foyer was threatened with closure, the partnership took over its funding. About six months after Newcastle city council cut all money for youth services, the partnership appointed a full-time youth worker. For all Stockdale\u2019s collectivist passions, if you believe wonders can result from the enforced retreat of the state, what happens here might hint at a positive case study \u2013 but scratch the surface and it is a lot more complicated. The coffee-and-conversation women say the weekly sessions are pretty much all the area\u2019s pensioners have left: cuts in council grants stopped the exercise classes and local history group. Doreen Jardine, chair of the residents\u2019 association, says that in the past she had enough money from the council to organise up to seven annual coach trips for local children. She\u2019s now down to two. And while Stockdale extols self-organisation, he also wonders how his area has reached this point. \u201cThis is one of the most deprived communities in Newcastle,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine what we could be doing if we didn\u2019t have to meet the costs of running our library? We run this thing on a shoestring, with the goodwill of a lot of people. And it\u2019s difficult.\u201d It is my fourth journalistic visit to Newcastle in three years. The last time I was here, in November 2014, I talked to people anxious about the city\u2019s fate, and pieced together the story of local austerity with the city\u2019s Labour leader, Nick Forbes. The council was in the midst of a \u00a3100m programme of cuts to be spread from 2013 to 2016. Its projections pointed to additional cuts in 2016-17 of \u00a330m then \u00a320m the next year \u2013 and Forbes suggested by that point the financial position would be impossible. \u201cBy 2017-18,\u201d he told me, \u201cour estimate is that we will have less than \u00a37m to spend on everything the city council does, above and beyond adult and children\u2019s social care. So it\u2019s completely untenable.\u201d Now, in the buildup to George Osborne\u2019s spending review, the position seems even tougher. The projected cuts for 2017-18 have gone up by \u00a320m, and thanks chiefly to Osborne\u2019s failure to pay down the deficit by his original deadline, another \u00a330m is set to follow in 2018-19. In April, the council will begin hacking back services at children\u2019s centres. But what Forbes is now most worried about is the social care it must provide by law. \u201cLooking into the next two or three years, I\u2019m struggling to see how we would do a balanced budget without closing down much of the social care provision in the city,\u201d he tells me. In that context, he says, \u201cwe are entering the realm of not just the politically impossible, but the legally impossible\u201d. The idea of having difficulties meeting the most basic statutory responsibilities, he says, \u201cis what keeps every council leader awake at night\u201d. Does he have any sense of the practical implications of future cuts? \u201cIt would mean taking significant numbers of social workers out of the system,\u201d he says. Last time I was in Newcastle, Forbes talked about an ongoing child sexual exploitation case that had at that point led to 50 arrests. The council, he said, had discharged its duties: \u201cWe had the teams in place to go in, and make sure children were safe and they were protected from further harm.\u201d Is that the kind of issue he worries about now? \u201cYes. Inevitably, with fewer social workers and less support, more problems are likely to take longer to identify. So far, we\u2019ve been rigorous in pursuing cases of abuse. That\u2019s one of the areas where, in future, we\u2019ll have fewer resources to do it, despite very obvious needs.\u201d When it comes to adult social care, Forbes confirms the council is considering axing hospital-based social workers who help patients when they return home (which will lead to longer hospital stays \u2013 and greater public spending). He also talks about reviewing most care packages for adults with learning disabilities and older people. All this, he explains, will be made even harder by the Care Act of 2014, which entails a huge round of new assessments and will burden the local authorities with subsidising the introduction of Osborne\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d so independent care providers stay afloat. So what is he going to do? The spending review, he says, will be the first big test for the new communities and local government secretary, Greg Clark. \u201cPrivately, he sympathises,\u201d says Forbes. \u201cPublicly, he backs the government\u2019s line.\u201d A few days after we meet, there are official briefings about a new proposal that will apparently be in the spending review: allowing local authorities to cover some of the costs of adult social care by raising council tax by up to 2%. I put in a call to Forbes, and find him less than impressed. Like many places, he explains, Newcastle has a low council tax base: it represents only about 11% of the council\u2019s overall budget, and even the full 2% rise would only raise around \u00a31.2 million a year. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to find cuts in adult social care next year of \u00a315m,\u201d he explains. The proposal, he says, amounts to a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. The fundamental problem is that there is not enough money in the system. In simple mathematical terms, I suggest, the situation looks impossible. Forbes bats away the prospect of municipal bankruptcy: \u201cI don\u2019t want to give the message that this is somewhere in terminal decline, because we\u2019re not,\u201d he says. So will he eventually have to tell the government he cannot set a budget? \u201cThere will be other councils that do that before we do. But this is where the whole of local government needs to come together to send a message to government \u2013 that councils cannot bear the kind of cuts that are being suggested.\u201d Elswick is a hard-scrabble area of west Newcastle \u2013 and two weeks ago, its pool and leisure centre closed. As part of the cuts programme, four other such facilities are being taken over by a private consortium, but it insisted Elswick was a non-starter: as far as local campaigners understand it, because the area\u2019s poverty means use of the centre \u2013 known simply as Elswick pool - has long been subsidised, it was not seen as viable. Diane Tait has spent much of the past three years campaigning to save the pool \u2013 and the local mother has plenty of stories that show what\u2019s been lost. \u201cWe spoke to somebody whose daughter had cerebral palsy, and she said the only time her daughter had ever spoken to her was when they were in the pool,\u201d she says. Council officials say they want a rescue plan involving some community initiative: Stockdale has recently talked about \u201cconstructive talks with local groups, who are interested in taking the leisure facility forward\u201d. Here, though the practicality of such big society-esque visions is uncertain at best. \u201cIf it\u2019s not financially viable for the leisure companies,\u201d wonders Tait, \u201chow\u2019s it supposed to be financially viable for a group of residents?\u201d We walk from her tower block to the pool. It is a forlorn sight: a huge glass construction surrounded by chipboard smattered with graffiti. Next door is a play area. There\u2019s a large crack in a big plastic slide that could easily cause injury, and a square of plywood has been nailed to the top to stop anyone using it \u2013 an indication that, as Forbes puts it, \u201cwe no longer have a parks maintenance budget\u201d. Courtney Latcham, 18, and her partner, Connor Whiteoak, a 17-year-old painter and decorator, are here with their one-year-old son, Cordy. \u201cSomeone must love teenage crime,\u201d says Latcham. \u201cCos there\u2019s nothing for kids round here to do any more.\u201d \u201cThey should be building more parks and pools, not less,\u201d offers Whiteoak. I ask them if they\u2019ve heard of George Osborne, and they reply in the negative. So who\u2019s to blame? \u201cThe government,\u201d says Whiteoak, a little distractedly, before he offers a sighing parting thought. \u201cI think they\u2019re past caring.\u201d",

Meanwhile, an effervescent 36-year-old councillor called David Stockdale is discussing plans to bring a key amenity into community ownership. The prime minister would presumably balk at his terminology: Stockdale proudly talks about a \u201csocialist post office\u201d.</p> <p>Since March 2013, the Blakelaw neighbourhood centre has been run as a not-for-profit local partnership, raising money and rising to the challenges presented by austerity. When the library that extends off the foyer was threatened with closure, the partnership took over its funding. About six months after Newcastle city council cut all money for youth services, the partnership appointed a full-time youth worker. </p> <p>For all Stockdale\u2019s collectivist passions, if you believe wonders can result from the enforced retreat of the state, what happens here might hint at a positive case study \u2013 but scratch the surface and it is a lot more complicated. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/nov/24/-sp-is-saving-newcastle-mission-impossible\">Is saving Newcastle a mission impossible? | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The coffee-and-conversation women say the weekly sessions are pretty much all the area\u2019s pensioners have left: cuts in council grants stopped the exercise classes and local history group. Doreen Jardine, chair of the residents\u2019 association, says that in the past she had enough money from the council to organise up to seven annual coach trips for local children. She\u2019s now down to two.</p> <p>And while Stockdale extols self-organisation, he also wonders how his area has reached this point. \u201cThis is one of the most deprived communities in Newcastle,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine what we could be doing if we didn\u2019t have to meet the costs of running our library? We run this thing on a shoestring, with the goodwill of a lot of people. And it\u2019s difficult.\u201d</p> <p>It is my fourth journalistic visit to Newcastle in three years. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/nov/24/-sp-is-saving-newcastle-mission-impossible\">last time I was here</a>, in November 2014, I talked to people anxious about the city\u2019s fate, and pieced together the story of local austerity with the city\u2019s Labour leader, Nick Forbes.</p> <p>The council was in the midst of a \u00a3100m programme of cuts to be spread from 2013 to 2016. Its projections pointed to additional cuts in 2016-17 of \u00a330m then \u00a320m the next year \u2013 and Forbes suggested by that point the financial position would be impossible. \u201cBy 2017-18,\u201d he told me, \u201cour estimate is that we will have less than \u00a37m to spend on everything the city council does, above and beyond adult and children\u2019s social care. So it\u2019s completely untenable.\u201d</p> <p>Now, in the buildup to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/nov/06/2015-comprehensive-spending-review-public-services\">George Osborne\u2019s spending review</a>, the position seems even tougher. The projected cuts for 2017-18 have gone up by \u00a320m, and thanks chiefly to Osborne\u2019s failure to pay down the deficit by his original deadline, another \u00a330m is set to follow in 2018-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a859160eaee7d40a0278056c0ab5b6d3e5f456fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a859160eaee7d40a0278056c0ab5b6d3e5f456fd/0_57_5760_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The park in Elswick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The park in Elswick, an area of Newcastle with high levels of deprivation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In April, the council will begin hacking back services at children\u2019s centres.

      "bodyText": "Small UK food suppliers and farmers are coming under increasing pressure from Britain\u2019s supermarket price war, with their profit margins cut by more than a third while those at bigger competitors have widened, according to research. Commercial lawyers EMW said small suppliers with an annual turnover below \u00a325m lacked the negotiating power of big rivals and as a result, their profit margins fell last year from 3.5% to 2.1%. By contrast, at the biggest food companies, whose turnover tops \u00a31bn, margins increased from 5.2% to 5.4%last year. Many farmers and other food suppliers are battling for survival. A study earlier this year found that the number of those strugging to stay afloat had leapt by more than 50%, with more than 1,600 growers and suppliers in \u201csignificant\u201d financial distress in the three months to the end of June, according to the insolvency specialists Begbies Traynor. Sebastian Calnan, a consultant at EMW, said: \u201cSmaller suppliers are one of the main casualties of the supermarket price war. These SMEs [small to medium enterprises] tend to have a smaller number of contracts, so find themselves in an impossible position when they come to the negotiating table. \u201cLarger suppliers often feel more confident about pushing back against the supermarkets because they have a stronger market position and greater demand for their products. SMEs are often too afraid of losing what may be their biggest contract, so there is often significant pressure from the supermarkets on smaller suppliers to accept contracts with unfavourable terms.\u201d Britain\u2019s big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 have slashed prices on thousands of products in a battle for customers with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl, whose combined market share passed 10% in the latest snapshot of grocery sales. Many supermarkets and large retailers are reliant on \u201ccommercial income\u201d \u2013 revenue received from suppliers to stock certain products \u2013 to boost profits. Often this means that a supplier pays rebates to the retailer based on the quantity of a product that has been sold. Calnan said: \u201cMany suppliers do not feel they are in a position to resist the supermarkets\u2019 demands for rebates. Currently, the relationship between supermarkets and their smaller suppliers is not as equitable as it should be. In many cases, there is the perverse situation where the more popular a product is with customers, the more money the supplier has to return to the supermarket.\u201d The latest figures from Britain\u2019s grocery industry watchdog, the Groceries Code Adjudicator, suggest there has been a fall in the number of suppliers reporting issues with supermarkets, but this does not appear to have improved the fortunes of the smaller end of the sector.",

SMEs are often too afraid of losing what may be their biggest contract, so there is often significant pressure from the supermarkets on smaller suppliers to accept contracts with unfavourable terms.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 have slashed prices on thousands of products in a battle for customers with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl,  whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/17/soaring-sales-at-aldi-and-lidl-drive-market-share-to-10-percent\">combined market share passed 10%</a> in the latest snapshot of grocery sales.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/17/aldi-and-lidl-continue-to-march-ahead-of-big-four-rivals\">Aldi and Lidl continue to march ahead of big four rivals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many supermarkets and large retailers are reliant on \u201ccommercial income\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/17/food-fight-secrets-supermarket-price-war\">revenue received from suppliers to stock certain products</a> \u2013 to boost profits. Often this means that a supplier pays rebates to the retailer based on the quantity of a product that has been sold.</p> <p>Calnan said: \u201cMany suppliers do not feel they are in a position to resist the supermarkets\u2019 demands for rebates. Currently, the relationship between supermarkets and their smaller suppliers is not as equitable as it should be. In many cases, there is the perverse situation where the more popular a product is with customers, the more money the supplier has to return to the supermarket.\u201d</p> <p>The latest figures from Britain\u2019s grocery industry watchdog, the Groceries Code Adjudicator, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/15/supermarket-pricing-uk-price-comparison-watchdog\">suggest there has been a fall</a> in the number of suppliers reporting issues with supermarkets, but this does not appear to have improved the fortunes of the smaller end of the sector.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Carolyn Fairbairn, the new head of the CBI, has backed Britain remaining in a reformed European Union and expressed confidence that Europe would not tear the employers\u2019 organisation apart. In an interview to mark her appointment as the first female director-general of the business lobby group, Fairbairn sought to smooth over differences between rival pro- and anti-EU camps that surfaced during its recent annual conference. She insisted CBI members would be asked for their views once the government had completed its negotiations with Britain\u2019s European partners and before the in/out referendum was held. Campaigners supporting Britain\u2019s exit from the EU have argued that a 2013 survey showed strong business support for membership was flawed, but Fairbairn said opponents were a vocal minority. \u201cOur members want to stay in a reformed European Union. They do see the benefits of a single market of 500 million people as significant.\u201d She said the CBI\u2019s wishlist of reforms \u2013 such as reducing regulation \u2013 was reflected in the negotiating stance adopted by David Cameron. \u201cBusiness wants to take the opportunity to secure reform, but at the point when the deal is done we will ask our members again. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will split the CBI. Some members hold different views but they are relatively few. We respect their views. They speak up. They are pretty vocal and that\u2019s fine.\u201d Fairbairn, who replaces John Cridland at the CBI, said she wanted to see the gap between London and the rest of the UK narrow during her five-year term. \u201cDevolution is the means not the end,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is creating a lot of energy. There is a real opportunity to stimulate growth outside London, which is 63% of the economy. \u201cLondon has been a fantastic driver of growth. It is a true megacity. But we have had three decades of London growing significantly faster than the regions and there is such opportunity there.\u201d Citing the way in which moving BBC staff from London to Salford had helped boost the Manchester economy, Fairbairn said: \u201cIt feels like a moment in time to unlock growth outside London.\u201d Relations between the government and the CBI have been noticeably cool in recent months, with the employers\u2019 organisation expressing unhappiness about issues such as the national living wage. Fairbairn adopted a conciliatory tone in her interview, noting that \u201cwhat the government is trying to do and what business wants are aligned\u201d. She supported the government\u2019s deficit-reduction plan and saw an opportunity for a \u201cproductive partnership\u201d. She wanted the CBI to focus on long-term problems. \u201cThe 2000s were times of high growth based on debt, and issues around skills, infrastructure and exports were not on the agenda. The recovery in the economy means there is now an opportunity to focus on supply-side issues again and the underlying foundations of the economy.\u201d One of the few areas where she was critical of the government is the apprenticeship levy, which she says businesses consider to be almost like a tax. She said there was a risk of the government creating low-skill apprenticeships simply to hit its target of creating 3m apprentices by 2020. \u201cOn infrastructure we rank 24th in the world even though we are the fifth-biggest economy,\u201d Fairbairn said. Expressing frustration at the delay over deciding whether a third runway would be built at Heathrow or Gatwick, she added: \u201cWe need to do much better at this.\u201d Fairbairn said the CBI appreciated that there was not going to be a lot of public money available, and that there was a need to tap alternative sources of long-term funding for infrastructure, such as pension funds. \u201cWe remain very supportive of the government\u2019s plan for fiscal consolidation. The job is not done. This is not a call for a massive increase in public spending.\u201d She said the chancellor George Osborne\u2019s autumn statement on Wednesday should protect spending on skills, infrastructure and innovation. Fairbairn lamented the UK\u2019s poor standing in the global league table for investment in research and development, and said it would be a mistake were funding for initiatives such as the catapult centres - designed to promote collaboration between scientists and business - to be cut back.",
