      "bodyText": "Tata Steel is set to pull out of all its UK operations, including Port Talbot, in a move that could put thousands of jobs at risk. The company announced late on Tuesday night that its board had rejected an \u201cunaffordable\u201d turnaround plan for Port Talbot and instead given the green light to a sale of its UK business. The move will affect about 15,000 workers and comprises the sites that used to make up British Steel and then Corus, which was bought by Tata Steel in 2007. Port Talbot is Britain\u2019s biggest steelworks and employs 4,000 people. However, it is losing \u00a31m a day, making the prospect of finding a buyer difficult. Union leaders travelled to Mumbai to discuss the company\u2019s UK business, hoping Tata would agree to a turnaround plan to keep steelmaking in Port Talbot and other UK plants. The MP for Aberavon, Stephen Kinnock, who was in Mumbai to lobby the Tata board, was briefed after the board meeting by Tata\u2019s chief financial officer. Kinnock told the South Wales Evening Post on Tuesday night: \u201cWe will not allow the closure of Port Talbot steelworks. One way or another we will continue to make steel in Port Talbot but it looks like Tata do not back the plan. We will work with Tata and the UK government to help find a buyer for the plant.\u201d The news will affect other Tata plants including Rotherham, Corby and Shotton. It is already in the process of selling its business in Scunthorpe to Greybull Capital, an investment firm. In a statement, Tata Steel confirmed its board had recommended exploring \u201call options for portfolio restructuring including the potential divestment of Tata Steel UK, in whole or in part\u201d. Tata blames cheap imports of Chinese steel, high energy costs and weak demand for threatening the future of its UK steelmaking. It said it had been in deep engagement with the government about \u201cseeking its support to achieve the best possible outcome for the UK business, within the restrictions of state aid rules and other statutory limits\u201d. Tata said these talks would continue. Union leaders said it was a \u201cvery dark day\u201d, while a spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour leader was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the reports from Mumbai. \u201cThe government must act now to protect the steel industry in Britain. Steel production must be maintained in Port Talbot,\u201d the spokesman said. Corbyn has previously called on the government to take a stake in the steel industry in order to protect jobs and prevent plants from closing. A crisis has engulfed much of the British steel industry in the past 12 months, with the Redcar steel plant, owned by Thai company SSI, closing late last year with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Port Talbot has already had to bear the brunt of 1,000 job losses announced in January. Earlier on Tuesday, Labour criticised Sajid Javid, the business secretary, for planning to fly to Australia on a trade visit while the fate of the Port Talbot plant hung in the balance. A spokeswoman for David Cameron conceded that no British minister was in Mumbai to monitor the progress of Tuesday\u2019s board meeting. \u201cWe are working very closely with the industry to look at ways we can help to deliver a long-term, sustainable future,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThere are already a number of steps that we have taken for the steel industry more broadly. We stand ready to work with Tata.\u201d Ahead of the news from Tata, the business minister, Anna Soubry, said the government was determined to ensure that Port Talbot continues to make steel. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday morning, Soubry said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should underestimate the determination of this prime minister, and this government, to make sure that we continue not just to roll steel at Port Talbot, actually to make it there, and at Scunthorpe as well. That is our determination.\u201d Soubry sought to blame Vince Cable, who was business secretary under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, for failing to do enough to protect the Port Talbot plant in the past. \u201cI think Vince could have done more: sorry, but that is my view,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was appointed, the prime minister specially said to me, \u2018We have some very real problems in our steel industry, and I want you to devote a large amount of your time to solving those problems as much as you can\u2019.\u201d Soubry suggested that the government was poised to take action if the plant looked set to be closed. \u201cWe are looking at all manner of options that may or may not be available to us as a government,\u201d she said. The Plaid Cymru leader, Leanne Wood, seized on the news to call for the Welsh assembly to be recalled to discuss the possible consequences of a sell-off. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, said: \u201cThis is a very dark day for the proud communities and a proud industry, which is now on the verge of extinction in this country. \u201cMy message to Sajid Javid and his government is that they cannot let another Redcar situation happen. Their dithering over intervention allowed the lights of that key industrial asset to be snuffed out.\u201d The shadow business secretary, Angela Eagle, said the government should consider part-nationalising the plants to \u201cshelter the assets until the storm has passed\u201d. \u201cI think the government should be pulling out all the stops to make certain we can preserve our steelmaking industry in this country\u201d, she told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight. \u201cWe have got to get the government to deliver on the assertions, from the prime minister down, that they want to preserve the steelworks in this country.\u201d Otherwise, she added, the prime minister\u2019s expressions of concern would be exposed as \u201ctea and sympathy, and hypocrisy\u201d. Eagle later said: \u201cSajid Javid and his team seem to have gone missing in action at this crucial time.\u201d Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community steelworkers union said: \u201cWe travelled to Mumbai to secure a future for steelmaking in south Wales and we are disappointed that the future remains uncertain, not just for Welsh steelworkers, but for thousands more workers in Tata\u2019s businesses elsewhere in the UK. \u201cHowever, our worst fear that Tata would announce plant closures today has not been realised. This is testament to the skills, experience and passion of UK steelworkers. \u201cThey are a world-class asset and now it seems other investors will have the opportunity to continue generations of world-class steel production. \u201cWe will of course wait to see the detail of Tata\u2019s divestment plans but, as we said before, it is vitally important that Tata is a responsible seller of its businesses and provides sufficient time to find new ownership. \u201cThere is also a crucial role for both the Welsh and UK governments to do all they can to ensure a future for Tata\u2019s remaining UK steel businesses, and to provide every assistance to secure a buyer that will continue steelmaking. \u201cWe don\u2019t want just want more warm words, we want a detailed plan of action to find buyers and build confidence in potential investors in UK steel. \u201cWe set out to Save our Steel in south Wales. We told Tata in no uncertain terms that there must not be an end to UK steelmaking. Our campaign has now broadened to saving Tata\u2019s remaining UK assets and securing a future for UK steelmaking, and Community as the steelworkers\u2019 union will not give up on that future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The train operator Great Western Railway has been banned from running adverts that suggest its service is publicly owned. A poster campaign introducing the company formerly known as First Great Western when it rebranded last September stated: \u201cThe railway belongs to the region it serves.\u201d Complainants to the Advertising Standards Authority pointed out that GWR belongs to its owner, FirstGroup, a multinational transport company listed on the London Stock Exchange, and not the people of south-west England. The ASA ruled that the advert was misleading and \u201cmight encourage consumers to use or enquire about using the service, for example, out of regional loyalty or because they believed profits directly belonged to the local region\u201d. It told GWR not to suggest in future that the railway franchise was publicly owned, if that was not the case. Cat Hobbs, director of the campaign group We Own It, said: \u201cPrivatisation is now so unpopular that train companies can get good PR by pretending to be publicly owned. The GWR advert is misleading \u2013 it\u2019s also a sign that it\u2019s time for real public ownership.\u201d The RMT union said it was good news that the ASA had reprimanded GWR for an \u201coutrageous stunt\u201d. The union\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cThe truth is that the private rail companies know that they are deeply unpopular for good reason ... RMT will continue to fight for real public ownership of the railways that sweeps away this whole rotten, profiteering system.\u201d A GWR spokesman said: \u201cWe are disappointed by the ASA\u2019s decision. This campaign was designed to highlight the significant social and economic benefits the railway and our train services bring to the region we serve. \u201cIt was never our intention to suggest GWR is a publicly owned company, instead we are proud of the work we do as a private company to benefit the region, and we are sorry if this wasn\u2019t clear.\u201d The ASA did not upheld a complaint about another GWR advert that described Isambard Kingdom Brunel as \u201cour illustrious founder\u201d, ruling that consumers were likely to understand founder in a broad sense, rather than the founder of the company itself. FirstGroup rebranded as GWR in 2015 after receiving another extension to run trains on the west of England mainline, a network it has run since privatisation with varying degrees of success. First Great Western was embroiled in controversy after declining to extend its franchise in 2013, avoiding paying large premiums to the government \u2013 but since continuing to run it anyway, on preferential terms.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The crisis in the British steel industry is the result of four big trends in the economy over the past 40 years. Issue number one has been the opening up of world markets in the process known as globalisation. In the decades immediately after the second world war, governments were able to protect their domestic steel industries through the use of high tariffs. Now they can\u2019t. Issue number two has been the rapid development of China as the world\u2019s dominant manufacturing force. China has developed a massive steel industry and, until recently, the rapid growth of industry and the building of new infrastructure meant homegrown demand pretty much tallied with supply. But now it doesn\u2019t because the Chinese economy has slowed and is becoming less biased towards manufacturing. China has excess capacity and is dumping its steel at below-market prices on the rest of the global economy. Issue number three has been the European Union, which has been slow to respond to the threat posed by China and which has tough rules that make it hard (if not impossible) for countries to ride to the rescue of their steel industries. The view from Brussels is that there is little sense in propping up steel plants that are losing money when the world is awash with unwanted steel. Some countries, Italy for example, have found ways of getting round state aid rules by saying that financial support is designed to meet tougher EU environmental standards. Issue number four has been UK government action, or rather the lack of it. Whitehall has not only saddled the UK steel industry with higher energy costs than those in Germany or France, it has been blocking proposals by some other EU countries to tackle Chinese dumping through higher tariffs. These four issues have come together in a perfect storm that threatens to blow away what remains of the UK steel industry. This creates a big headache for the government, which will come under pressure from critics to do for the steel workers of Port Talbot what it did for the bankers of the City of London. With a referendum on EU membership coming up on 23 June, ministers will be wary of saying that they would like to do more but are being prevented by Brussels from doing so. So what are the options? The government could start showing the steel sector the tender loving care so noticeable by its absence in the recent past. Every steel industry in the developed west has shrunk in the past 15 years: Britain\u2019s decline has been particularly marked. Cutting energy costs and business rates would help, but it is probably too late for that. If they wanted to step things up a notch, ministers could announce an action plan to help the steel industry while an anti-dumping action is taken against China at the World Trade Organisation, something that is likely to take at least a year. It would boost infrastructure spending and say, notwithstanding EU procurement rules, that it would bend over backwards to favour UK producers. In the current circumstances, with the referendum looking close, it might meet little opposition in Brussels. Then there are the \u201cbig bang\u201d options. The government could pay foreign owners to keep UK plants open, which in the case of Port Talbot would mean an open-ended taxpayer subsidy to Tata. Or it could decide to renationalise an industry that has been in private hands since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government sold it off in 1988. Make no mistake, though, whether in state or private hands, and whether Britain is inside the EU or not, the problems of the steel industry will not go away.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has muttered for so long about the possible dangers lurking in buy-to-let lending, the most excitable end of the housing market, that it had to do something. Against that backdrop, Tuesday\u2019s policy response can only be viewed as timid. Would-be landlords \u2013 or, at least, those who weren\u2019t planning to perform advanced gymnastics with their personal finances \u2013 will not tremble. All that will happen is that some banks will have to apply slightly stricter lending standards. In reality, those stricter standards are merely sensible ones that most lenders have adopted already. The Bank is only talking about testing a borrower\u2019s ability to pay an interest rate of 5.5% when all tax liabilities are properly taken into account. That is hardly onerous when fixed-rate deals in the buy-to-let market are generally pitched around the 3.5% mark. Even the Bank expects the boom in buy-to-let lending to slow barely at all. Lenders had been expecting to increase their buy-to-let lending by 20% over the next two years, the Bank discovered. After the effort to remove the riskiest slice of loans, the rate of increase may fall to about 17%. Big deal. The potential perils of rampant buy-to-let lending are easy to identify. In a downturn landlords may be inclined to cut and run, creating headaches elsewhere. Or, in the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee formal language, \u201cbuy-to-let investors could behave pro-cyclically, amplifying cycles in the housing market, as well as affecting the resilience of the banking system and its capacity to sustain lending to the wider real economy in a stress\u201d. That\u2019s still a potential threat, note. But, with buy-to-let lending already close to 2007 levels as a share of the overall mortgage market, the Bank had room to be bolder, for example by placing caps on loan-to-value ratios. Instead, it has reached for one of the smallest tools in its new kit-bag. It may be a case of too little, too late. Don\u2019t turn on Tata As Tata Steel\u2019s board pondered the future of the Port Talbot steel plant into the early hours, it was a bit rich for UK government figures to opine to the FT that the Indian company risked \u201cshredding\u201d its reputation if it opted for closure. Read last December\u2019s report by the business select committee into the UK government\u2019s handling of the crisis and it is hard to conclude that the reputation of any of its own ministers has been enhanced. The report complained that the government was slow to heed the industry\u2019s warnings. When relief was offered on energy costs and business rates, it came slowly. It was a similar story on changes to procurement guidelines to improve the chances of UK firms winning major orders. \u201cWe regret that this change in policy was not made many months, if not years, earlier,\u201d said the report. Then there is the troubled issue of Chinese dumping of steel, the single biggest reason for the crisis. The startling fact is that the US seems able to reach a decision on illegal dumping in two months whereas the European commission takes between nine and 15 months. The UK clearly can\u2019t be blamed directly for foot-dragging in Brussels but \u201csuccessive governments should have done much more to press for accelerated action at an EU level,\u201d concluded the select committee. There are no easy answers to this crisis. Powerful global forces, and the Chinese government\u2019s refusal to address over-capacity in its steel industry, are at work. Nor can the UK government underwrite the losses of a private company like Tata. But making cheap insults in the hope of bullying the company into backing a restructuring plan isn\u2019t a strategy either. Sticky sugar stance AG Barr, maker of Irn-Bru and other fizzy drinks, can\u2019t seem to make up its mind. On one hand, chief executive Roger White decried the chancellor\u2019s plan for a levy on sugary soft drinks as \u201cpunitive\u201d. On the other, he wanted to reassure shareholders that the supposed punishment won\u2019t hurt. \u201cWe anticipate that brand loyalty and consumer preference will drive continued demand,\u201d he said. White would be better advised to stick to his other lobbying line about the tax being arbitrary. On that score, it\u2019s easy to sympathise. If George Osborne\u2019s aim is to reduce childhood obesity, chocolate seems an equally legitimate target. But if Barr thinks the punters will be prepared to pay the extra tax, estimated at 8p per can, for the privilege of drinking full-sugar Irn-Bru, a cash-strapped chancellor may conclude that he could get away with a higher rate.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cPoliticians keep saying they hear our plight, somehow I don\u2019t see them up for the fight.\u201d These are lines of a poem written by a steelworker at Port Talbot as the board of Tata Steel met to discuss the plant\u2019s fate. The poem was sent to Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP, who is campaigning to save the Welsh site. The steelworks has been at the heart of the local community since 1901. It employs roughly 4,000 people and produces every Heinz food tin sold in the UK, every roof of a Nissan Juke car and every new 1p and 2p coin. However, as the UK\u2019s largest steelworks, Port Talbot is at the heart of the storm battering the steel industry. At its peak at the end of the 1960s and start of the 1970s, the plant employed about 20,000 people. However, like the rest of the UK steel industry, it has gradually shrunk. Production of crude steel in the UK fell to the lowest level since the 1930s in 2011. After a fragile recovery since then, the steel industry is now under renewed pressure from a powerful collection of factors. Demand for steel has never recovered since the financial crisis in 2008. As a result, steelworks across the world are estimated to have the capacity to produce 300 million tones more steel than is being used. Imports of Chinese steel into Europe have more than doubled in the last two years as companies have desperately tried to make up for a slowdown in domestic demand by selling steel abroad. The increase in Chinese exports, coupled with slow demand, has helped to send the price of steel down by half since 2011 in Europe. At the same time, energy costs have gone up for steel producers. The Port Talbot plant uses as much electricity as the nearby city of Swansea, which demonstrates why fluctuations in energy prices can have a major impact. The key steel plants in the UK also need to be modernised. Tata has invested \u00a3350m in its Welsh operations in the last five years, including \u00a3200m for a new blast furnace at Port Talbot. However, it is thought to require another \u00a3500m to build new stripping and rolling mills. The squeeze on steel has already led to the collapse of the plant at Redcar in Teeside, as well as thousands of job losses, including at other Tata plants. Tata is pressing ahead with the sale of its business in Scunthorpe to Greybull Capital, an investment firm. Until late last year, the focus of Tata had been on Scunthorpe and its long products division, which includes steel beams and columns. However, with the pressure on the industry showing no signs of easing, the focus has now switched to Tata\u2019s strip products business, which includes Port Talbot and makes a wide range of steel designs. Port Talbot is understood to be losing more than \u00a31m a day. One industry source said: \u201cIt is clear that strip products is now making a bigger loss than long products ever was.\u201d Tata Steel took control of Port Talbot in 2007 when it bought Corus, previously known as British Steel, for \u00a36.2bn. The company employs roughly 80,000 people across five continents. It could never have imagined that less than ten years after it bought Corus it would have faced such a crisis. The turnaround plan for Port Talbot and the strip products division involves cutting around \u00a3350m of costs and focusing on high-end products for key industries such as automotive, engineering and consumer goods. However, a key backer of the plan, Karl Koehler, chief executive of Tata Steel Europe, announced he was leaving the company last month. In order for the plan to work, Tata needs to pump more investment into its UK operations. The company says it has already invested \u00a31.5bn since buying Corus, but this has been outweighed by the \u00a32bn impairment charges on its UK operations as the losses have racked up. As a result, Tata is under pressure in India to pull out of the UK and focus on its domestic steel business, which is benefitting from the introduction of tariffs against Chinese steel \u2013 a move the Conservative government is reluctant to follow.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our news story about Janet Yellen\u2019s speech...and some more hawkish comments from other Federal Reserve policymakers: Goodnight! GW The odds of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates this summer have just fallen. That\u2019s according to the latest market data from Wall Street: Echoing the Bank of England this morning, Janet Yellen also warns that the economic outlook has deteriorated recently. Fed chair Janet Yellen is also warning that China\u2019s slowing economy is a potential threat to the global economy. She says: One concern pertains to the pace of global growth, which is importantly influenced by developments in China. There is a consensus that China\u2019s economy will slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and from exports toward domestic sources of growth. There is much uncertainty, however, about how smoothly this transition will proceed and about the policy framework in place to manage any financial disruptions that might accompany it. These uncertainties were heightened by market confusion earlier this year over China\u2019s exchange rate policy. Yellen also points to the recent fall in the commodity prices -and cautions against assuming it is unalloyed good news for Americans. Instead, the world economy could suffer if oil producing nations slash spending or sack workers. The Fed chief says: For the United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic activity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer. But the apparent negative reaction of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part reflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some countries and energy firms. In the case of countries reliant on oil exports, the result might be a sharp cutback in government spending; for energy-related firms, it could entail significant financial strains and increased layoffs. In the event oil prices were to fall again, either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global economy. The full speech is online here: America\u2019s top central banker, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, is speaking to the Economic Club of New York right now. And Yellen is dropping a hint that US interest rates are likely to only rise modestly in the months and years ahead. She argues that the Federal Open Market Committee [FOMC] which sets interest rates can\u2019t risk tightening monetary policy too fast, as it could be difficult to row back. On the other hand, going too slowly is less risky as the FOMC could simply accelerate the tightening. Or in Yellen\u2019s words: I consider it appropriate for the Committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy. This caution is especially warranted because, with the federal funds rate so low, the FOMC\u2019s ability to use conventional monetary policy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric. If economic conditions were to strengthen considerably more than currently expected, the FOMC could readily raise its target range for the federal funds rate to stabilize the economy. By contrast, if the expansion was to falter or if inflation was to remain stubbornly low, the FOMC would be able to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds rate back to near zero. And that has sent shares jumping on Wall Street, as investors hail the idea of more low borrowing costs and cheap money. After a choppy day\u2019s trading, the FTSE 100 finished the session almost exactly where it started. London\u2019s blue chip index has closed down half a point, at 6105.90. Retailers led the risers, with Marks &amp; Spencer and Associated British Foods both gaining 3%. But that was cancelled out by falling mining stocks; commodity trader Glencore lost almost 5%, followed by Anglo American (-4.3%), and Rio Tinto (-3.8%). They were hit by the impact of the stronger US dollar, which pushes down commodity prices. The markets had begun the day in decent enough spirits after Easter. But the mood darkened - rather like the weather - after the Bank of England\u2019s latest warnings on the EU referendum and global risks. Trustnet\u2019s Tony Cross fears more volatility ahead: The shadow of Brexit looms large over financial markets with investors, companies and the government unable to make cast iron decisions until the result is known. Much like the Scottish referendum this one looks set to go down to the wire, so expect market volatility to be heightened as we close in on the vote. Over in America, consumer confidence has jumped unexpectedly. The monthly Consumer Confidence Index jumped to 96.2 in March, beating forecasts of a small rise to 94. Those interviewed said they were more optimistic about short-term prospects, which suggests the recent stock market recovery may have fed through. Mark Carney has been trying his best to avoid being dragged into the EU referendum issue. When he testified to MPs three weeks ago, the BoE governor argued that Brexit was more than a financial issue, and wouldn\u2019t give any forecasts about growth or employment after the vote. But despite that, the Bank is clearly concerned about the EU referendum, in under three months. Today\u2019s report shows that policymakers anticipate serious ructions if the public vote to leave the EU, and are taking precautions. Here\u2019s the main points. The Bank of England has warned that Britain\u2019s financial system looks less secure than three months ago. China\u2019s slowing economy, the flow of capital out of emerging economies, and the recent fall in asset prices all show rising instability. The BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee singled out the Brexit referendum as the biggest threat to domestic stability. They warned that if Britain votes to leave the EU, the pound would tumble, banks would tighten lending, and the UK could struggle to finance its current account deficit. Campaigners to remain in the EU urged the public to take the warning seriously. But Brexit supporters argue that the UK economy would have brighter prospects outside Europe. The BoE has also taken action against buy-to-let landlords. It is forcing lenders to apply tougher affordability checks, to ensure borrowers aren\u2019t over-extending themselves. One leading estate agent reckons the move is overkill. Landlords already face higher stamp duty costs from April, and some may struggle to cope with this new clampdown. In other news.... City investors are waiting to hear from Janet Yellen. The head of the US Federal Reserve is giving a speech in New York, in a few hours time (from 4.30pm BST) Workers at Port Talbot\u2019s steel workers are poised to learn whether India\u2019s Tata will support a rescue plan. In the eurozone, new data has shown that bank lending has picked up. It still remains historically weak, though. After a bright start, European stock markets have now lost their early gains. And the oil price has continued to slide. Brent crude is down almost 3% at $39.18 a barrel, dragged down by pessimism that oil producers will ever agree production cuts. Campaigners to leave the EU are (understandably) less alarmed by the Financial Policy Committee\u2019s concerns. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, argues that Britain\u2019s economy would be more, not less, secure out of the EU. \u2018The biggest risk to the UK economy, a risk that even the Bank of England acknowledges, is Britain remaining in a declining political union where we are outvoted and our trade is held back. Even pro-EU campaigners have admitted that after we Vote Leave on June 23rd we will secure a deal where the economy will grow and jobs will be created. The safest thing for our economic security is to spend our money on our priorities.\u2019 Campaigners to stay in the European Union are seizing on the Bank of England\u2019s warning that Brexit is a threat to UK financial stability. And leading the way is Alistair Darling, Britain\u2019s former Chancellor of the Exchequer. He says the Financial Policy Committee\u2019s \u201cstark warning\u201d should be taken very seriously. In a statement released by the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, Darling says: The independent assessment that uncertainty around the UK\u2019s membership of the EU is \u2018the most significant near-term domestic risk to financial stability\u2019 will be a major worry for everyone whose job and income depends on the long-term health of Britain\u2019s economy. \u201cThis assessment makes it clear our economy would be more vulnerable and less resilient if we vote to leave the EU \u2013 leading to higher mortgage rates for families and higher interest rates for Britain\u2019s businesses. \u201cThis is not a report Leave campaigners can simply dismiss as \u2018biased\u2019 or \u2018scaremongering\u2019. It is a serious piece of work that should make everyone think twice about irresponsibly gambling with people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods. \u201cIt is clear from this report that Britain is stronger, safer and better off remaining a member of the EU.\u201d Darling was Britain\u2019s finance minister during the financial crisis, when he handled the bailouts of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, isn\u2019t impressed by the Bank of England\u2019s new clampdown on buy-to-let lending. Leaf, a former chairman of the RICS trade body, argues that recent measures announced by the UK government will cool the market. The BoE should have waited to see the effect, rather than deciding to force lenders to enforce tougher affordability checks, he argues: The changes the Chancellor has made to mortgage interest tax relief and higher stamp duty for landlords will have enough of an impact on buy-to-let without the need for further interference from the Bank of England. Landlords will already be put off investing further unless the numbers add up and this is a case of kicking them when they are down. Leaf also argues that rental costs could actually go up if BTL landlords quit the sector, as it would reduce availability. On the other hand, that could also allow more renters to move onto the housing ladder.... As we suspected, the Bank of England is keen to take the heat out of the buy-to-let mortgage market. The BoE will push small mortgage lenders to enforce higher standards, including tighter checks on landlords\u2019 income and the impact of new stamp duty rates on BTL mortgages. Under the plan, lenders must that that borrowers have enough funds to cover interest payments, even if borrowing costs went up to 5.5%. My colleague Sean Farrell is attending today\u2019s briefing, and explains: On buy-to-let lending, the committee said: \u201cThe FPC remains alert to potential threats to financial stability from rapid growth in buy-to-let mortgage lending.\u201d The committee, chaired by the governor, Mark Carney, said it expected measures announced by the Bank\u2019s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulatory Authority, to dampen the market. The buy-to-let property market has leapt back into life over the past three years after slumping during the financial crisis. Last year, gross lending for buy-to-let property jumped to about \u00a337bn, up from less than \u00a310bn in 2009 and approaching the peak of almost \u00a345bn in 2007. More here: Bank of England clamps down on buy-to-let lending Augustin Eden, analyst at City firm Accendo Markets, sums up the Bank of England\u2019s message: June\u2019s Brexit referendum could both push up borrowing costs AND weaken Sterling, according to the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee. Of course, the reason for a rise in borrowing costs won\u2019t be an interest rate hike by the central bank, it\u2019ll be increased risk. Update: That Brexit opinion poll is closer than you might think..... Bang on cue, a new opinion poll has shown that European Union referendum battle has got tighter. A poll for the Evening Standard newspaper gives the Remain campaign an eight point lead, at 49% vs 41% to Leave. Last month, Remain was ahead by 54% to 36%, an 18% point advantage. The survey also found that many people believe prime minister David Cameron should resign if the public vote to leave the EU. Here\u2019s the story: Half of public say Cameron must quit if he loses EU poll UK government insiders are briefing that the Bank of England\u2019s Brexit comments are an important contribution to the debate ahead of June\u2019s referendum. However, Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway reports that the Bank doesn\u2019t share this enthusiasm: So who\u2019s right? Well, governor Mark Carney did brief MPs about the EU referendum earlier this month, when he labelled Brexit the biggest single domestic risk to stability. He also suggested that some banks could leave the City in the event of a Brexit vote. However, I don\u2019t recall Carney warning specifically that Brexit would make it harder to borrow. And anyway, this is the first time that the Financial Policy Committee has been so explicit about its concerns. This morning\u2019s stock market rally is fizzling out, in the face of the Bank of England\u2019s gloomy prognosis. The FTSE 100 is just 3 points higher (having jumped nearly 50 points at the start of trading). Britain could suffer a credit crunch if the public vote to leave the European Union in the referendum on June 23, the Bank of England claims. The BoE\u2019e Financial Policy Committee warns that uncertainty over Brexit has already hit the pound, and driven up the cost of insuring against a sterling crisis. It now fears that \u201cany period of extended uncertainty following the vote could increase risks to financial stability.\u201d In today\u2019s statement, the FPC says: Looking ahead, heightened and prolonged uncertainty has the potential to increase the risk premia investors require on a wider range of UK assets, which could lead to a further depreciation of sterling and affect the cost and availability of financing for a broad range of UK borrowers. BoE policymakers also fear that Britain could struggle to support its current account deficit if investors shun UK assets. It says: The financing of that deficit is reliant on continuing material inflows of portfolio and foreign direct investment. Those flows have contributed to the financing of the public sector financial deficit and corporate investment, including in commercial real estate. Heightened uncertainty could test the capacity of core funding markets at a time when the liquidity of these markets has shown signs of fragility across advanced economies. And to complete the gloomy Brexit picture, the BoE also predicts that the eurozone would suffer too: The impact of a decision of the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union could spill over to the euro area, driving up risk premia and further diminishing the prospects for growth there. Newsflash: The Bank of England is warning that the outlook for financial stability in the United Kingdom has deteriorated over the last four months. In a new report, the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee cites the slowdown in the Chinese economy, weaker growth across the globe, and recent market turbulence. It also singles out the upcoming EU referendum as the \u201cmost significant near-term domestic risk\u201d to the UK. The FPC says: Some pre-existing risks have crystallised, drawing on the resilience of the system. Other risks stemming from the global environment have increased. Domestic risks have been supplemented by risks around the EU referendum. In a subdued report, the FPC flags up that emerging market economies have suffered capital outflows, following last December\u2019s hike in US interest rates. There have also been \u201cwidespread falls in the prices of risky assets.\u201d And it also cites concerns over China\u2019s economy, and the recent heavy falls in bank share prices. Here\u2019s the key section: In an environment of low inflation and continued weakness in investment and productivity growth, prospects for global nominal growth are subdued. This raises questions about resilience to future adverse shocks, particularly for emerging market economies where debt levels continue to rise and terms of trade have deteriorated. In this environment, the re-acceleration of credit growth in China is concerning. In some advanced economies, lower nominal interest rates associated with weak growth prospects are restraining profitability in banking systems that are still in post-crisis repair and pose challenges for some banking business models. Globally, bank equity prices have fallen significantly and a material proportion of banks are now trading below book value. More to follow.... Anticipation is building in the City, ahead of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s speech today (at around 4.30pm BST). Yellen is due to deliver a speech called \u201cEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\u201d at the Economic Club of New York luncheon. In traders\u2019 heads, that speech is subtitled \u201cHere\u2019s some hints about might the Fed raise interest rates again\u201d. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, says: The dollar has started to recover at least some of the ground it has lost in the last week. Investors now await Federal Reserve Chair Yellen\u2019s speech this afternoon for more news on the possibilities of future US interest hikes. Natural resource stocks aren\u2019t sharing in today\u2019s rally. Instead, mining stocks are leading the fallers in London, as a stronger US dollar hits commodity prices. Anglo American is leading the way, down 4%, amid concern that the recent recovery in the copper price is faltering. Brenda Kelly, chief analyst at London Capital Group, says: UK miners are enjoying their usual habitat \u2013 back in the red.... Weaker growth in developed markets and word that China is building inventories rather than utilising for construction coupled with the strong dollar would indicate that the 15% gain in copper since mid-January has been built on sand. More here: Equities higher ahead of Yellen Oversupply worries are dragging the oil steadily lower this morning. Brent crude is now down almost 2% at $39.53 per barrel, with analysts citing the regular concerns about weak demand and an oversupply glut. While Tata Steel\u2019s board decides the fate of Port Talbot\u2019s steelworkers, UK politicians have been bickering about whose fault it all is. Over to the Press Association: Business Minister Anna Soubry said the Government was prepared to consider \u201call options\u201d to ensure that steel production continued at the South Wales site. \u201cWe are looking at all manner of options that may or may not be available to us as a Government, all options,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme \u201cIt starts from a base of making sure that we continue to make steel in Port Talbot.\u201d She suggested that Liberal Democrat former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable had not done enough to address the problems in the British steel industry during his time in office between 2010 and 2015. \u201cI think Vince could have done more, yes. Sorry, but that is my view. We were in a coalition then,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was appointed the Prime Minister specifically said to me, \u2018we know we have some very real problems in our steel industry and I want you to devote a large amount of your time to solving those problems as much as you can\u2019.\u201d Her comments were dismissed as \u201cutterly rubbish\u201d by Lib Dem leader Tim Farron who said Sir Vince had protected the Redcar plant, which has subsequently closed, and the wider steel industry. \u201cThis Government has no plan and is failing them,\u201d he said. Hold onto your hats, folks. We have some encouraging financial data from Europe. Bank lending to eurozone businesses rose by 0.9% in February, up from 0.6% in January. That indicates that companies are becoming more confident and looking to borrow to fund new plans. And bank loans to eurozone households rose by 1.6%, which is the fastest growth since 2011. That could be another sign of economic demand picking up, after years of weak activity. As this tweet shows, lending to consumers and firms hit a trough in 2014 as the single currency bloc slumped into deflation. Anna Stupnytska, economist at Fidelity, reckons the European Central Bank\u2019s latest stimulus package should continue to push lending higher this year: Europe\u2019s stock markets are up across the board: Shares in oil exploration firm Rockhopper have slumped by 10% after a United Nations commission ruled that the Falklands Islands fall within Argentina\u2019s territorial waters. Rockhopper has been drilling around the Falklands for several years, and in January it announced it had discovered oil off the northern coast. But the Falklands\u2019 nascent oil industry could now be disrupted, after the UN said it agreed that Argentina\u2019s territory extended up to 350 miles from the coast. That would include the Falklands. Associated Press has more details: The Argentine foreign ministry said its waters had increased by 1.7 million square km (0.66 million square miles) and the decision will be key in its dispute with Britain over the islands. Argentina lost a brief, bloody 1982 war with Britain after Argentinian troops seized the South Atlantic archipelago that Latin Americans call the Malvinas. The UN commission on the limits of the continental shelf sided with Argentina, ratifying the country\u2019s 2009 report fixing the limit of its territory at 200 to 350 miles from its coast. The mood in the City right now: Over in Mumbai, British union leaders have made a last-ditch attempt to persuade steel giant Tata to keep supporting Wales Port Talbot plant. Community, the steel union, says the talks with Tata\u2019s board were \u2018open and constructive\u2019. They hope that Tata will back a \u00a3100m rescue plan for the site, which is reportedly losing \u00a31m per day. But workers fear that Tata will decide today to mothball the site, which is Britain\u2019s largest steelworks. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct suspects today\u2019s rally won\u2019t last long. Following a slump on Thursday, which was induced by a strengthening dollar, falling commodities and a downbeat update from Next, this looks like an opportunistic bet by investors eager to make a quick buck and buy on the dips. Given the index\u2019s recent tumultuous form it is hard to see this being sustained... European stock markets have opened higher this morning as traders return to their desks after the Easter break. The main indices have risen by at least 0.5% at the open, as traders ponder the strength of the recent rally since the turmoil of January and early February. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 47 points or 0.8% to 6154, in a fairly broad rally led by financial firms such as Barclays, Prudential and Standard Life. Investors have had a long weekend to chew over the state of the global economy, from the slowdown in China to the deflationary pressures in the eurozone. But it\u2019s still hard to say whether 2016 will be a good year for shares, given recent weak economic data and geopolitical tensions. Philip Borkin, a senior economist in Auckland at ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd, summed up the mood well in a note to clients: \u201cIt is certainly not a global economic backdrop where one could say that a lot of clarity is on offer at present.\u201d And CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson says there\u2019s little reason for investors to be particularly positive right now: Over the last couple of weeks European markets have struggled to move meaningfully in either direction, contained by a stabilisation in commodity prices, slightly less concern about the Chinese economy, and commitments to slightly looser policy from the Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and the Peoples Bank of China. And the oil market continues to be stalked by oversupply fears. That\u2019s pushed the price of Brent crude oil down by almost 1% this morning, back below $40 per barrel. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a nerve-wracking day for Britain\u2019s steel industry. Top executives at India\u2019s Tata are meeting in Mumbai to decide whether to continue supporting its operation in Port Talbot. The Welsh factory has already suffered deep job cuts, in the face of slumping steel prices. Tata must now decide whether to invest more in the plant to ensure its future, or not. At 11am BST the Bank of England will announce the details of the stress tests which Britain\u2019s largest banks will face later this year. The BoE may also signal that it is ready to clamp down on buy-to-let property owners, when it publishes its review of the sector. Investors will also be watching for a speech by Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, at 4.30pm BST. She may drop some hints about the prospects of US interest rate rises in the coming months. Chris Weston of IG explains: The interest rate markets see a further hike in June as a 36% probability, so in theory, Ms Yellen only really needs to acknowledge the improvement in inflation forces and we could see the US dollar rally. The latest measure of US consumer confidence, due at 3pm BST, could also show whether America could stomach higher interest rates. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

There is a consensus that China\u2019s economy will slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and from exports toward domestic sources of growth. There is much uncertainty, however, about how smoothly this transition will proceed and about the policy framework in place to manage any financial disruptions that might accompany it. These uncertainties were heightened by market confusion earlier this year over China\u2019s exchange rate policy.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Yellen also points to the recent fall in the commodity prices -and cautions against assuming it is unalloyed good news for Americans.</strong> </p> <p>Instead, the world economy could suffer if oil producing nations slash spending or sack workers.</p> <p>The Fed chief says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic activity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer. But the apparent negative reaction of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part reflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some countries and energy firms. In the case of countries reliant on oil exports, the result might be a sharp cutback in government spending; for energy-related firms, it could entail significant financial strains and increased layoffs. In the event oil prices were to fall again, either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global economy.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full speech is online here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/boes_/status/714849785824604160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yellen dovish, like two weeks ago: highlights concerns over global growth and inflation expectations <a href=\"https://t.co/7mrAQ6Z8Gv\">https://t.co/7mrAQ6Z8Gv</a></p>&mdash; Matthew B (@boes_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boes_/status/714849785824604160\">March 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56faac40e4b0db49e2ff367f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-29T16:29:42.173Z\">5.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yellen: Fed must be cautious about rate hikes</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>America\u2019s top central banker, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, is speaking to the Economic Club of New York right now.</strong></p> <p>And Yellen is dropping a hint that US interest rates are likely to only rise modestly in the months and years ahead.</p> <p>She argues that the Federal Open Market Committee [FOMC] which sets interest rates can\u2019t risk tightening monetary policy too fast, as it could be difficult to row back.</p> <p>On the other hand, going too slowly is less risky as the FOMC could simply accelerate the tightening.</p> <p>Or in Yellen\u2019s words:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I consider it appropriate for the Committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy. This caution is especially warranted because, with the federal funds rate so low, the FOMC\u2019s ability to use conventional monetary policy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric.</p> <p> If economic conditions were to strengthen considerably more than currently expected, the FOMC could readily raise its target range for the federal funds rate to stabilize the economy. By contrast, if the expansion was to falter or if inflation was to remain stubbornly low, the FOMC would be able to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds rate back to near zero.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And that has sent shares jumping on Wall Street, as investors hail the idea of more low borrowing costs and cheap money.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/714850019237564416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Markets Now: Dow, S&amp;P 500 take sharp jump higher after Yellen comments \u00bb <a href=\"https://t.co/rtSdqa2OJM\">https://t.co/rtSdqa2OJM</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/yAEeCrpUlD\">pic.twitter.com/yAEeCrpUlD</a></p>&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/714850019237564416\">March 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56faaad0e4b0db49e2ff3677\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-29T16:22:38.672Z\">5.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 ends the day flat</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>After a choppy day\u2019s trading, the FTSE 100 finished the session almost exactly where it started.</strong></p> <p>London\u2019s blue chip index has closed down half a point, at 6105.90.

      "bodyText": "The government has insisted that it is committed to the future of steelmaking in Britain as Tata Steel executives debated through the night about the future of Port Talbot, the country\u2019s biggest steelworks. The board of Tata Steel, the owner of the Welsh plant, met in Mumbai on Tuesday to decide whether to back an ambitious restructuring plan for Port Talbot that would involve laying off hundreds of staff but keeping the plant open. Instead of approving the plan, Tata could decide to mothball the plant, downsize it, or set a deadline for Port Talbot to improve its performance before taking a final decision. About 4,000 people are employed at Port Talbot, but thousands more jobs rely on the steelworks. However, the plant and the division it is part of are losing more than \u00a31m a day and Tata is under pressure in India to cut its losses on UK steel so that it can focus on the domestic market. Tata blames cheap imports of Chinese steel and high energy costs for threatening the future of its UK steelmaking. Port Talbot has already had to bear the brunt of 1,000 job losses announced in January. The business minister, Anna Soubry, said the government was determined to ensure that Port Talbot continues to make steel. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Soubry said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should underestimate the determination of this prime minister, and this government, to make sure that we continue not just to roll steel at Port Talbot, actually to make it there, and at Scunthorpe as well. That is our determination.\u201d Soubry sought to blame Vince Cable, who was business secretary under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, for failing to do enough to protect the Port Talbot plant in the past. \u201cI think Vince could have done more: sorry, but that is my view,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was appointed, the prime minister specially said to me, \u2018We have some very real problems in our steel industry, and I want you to devote a large amount of your time to solving those problems as much as you can\u2019.\u201d Soubry said it was important to allow the Indian conglomerate to make its own decision but suggested that the government was poised to take action if the plant looked set to be closed. \u201cWe are looking at all manner of options that may or may not be available to us as a government,\u201d she said. A crisis has engulfed much of the British steel industry in the past 12 months, with the Redcar steel plant, owned by Thai company SSI, closing late last year with the loss of 1,700 jobs. A spokeswoman for David Cameron conceded that no British minister was in Mumbai to monitor the progress of Tuesday\u2019s board meeting, as it emerged that the business secretary, Sajid Javid, was preparing to fly to Australia, with the future of the Port Talbot plant still hanging in the balance. \u201cWe are working very closely with the industry to look at ways we can help to deliver a long-term, sustainable future,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThere are already a number of steps that we have taken for the steel industry more broadly. We stand ready to work with Tata.\u201d She stressed that Javid, and the former Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb, who was promoted to work and pensions secretary after the resignation of Iain Duncan Smith earlier this month, had previously been liaising with the Indian company over the future of the steelworks. While in Australia, Javid is due to address the Australian British Chamber of Commerce and meet the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to discuss issues including cybersecurity. Officials from the Community trade union, which represents steelworkers, reported that they had \u201cconstructive\u201d talks with senior company representatives in Mumbai. \u201cThe delegation from Community led by Roy Rickhuss, general secretary, along with Stephen Kinnock, MP for Aberavon, and Frits van Wieringen, chairman of the Tata Steel European works council, met in Mumbai with senior representatives of Tata Steel in advance of the board meeting,\u201d a spokesman for the union said. \u201cThe meeting was open and constructive. The European delegates made the case for Tata to continue to support the UK business. Tata Steel representatives outlined the context of commitment to the UK business to date, financial performance and the challenging global conditions of the steel sector.\u201d More than 35,000 people have signed an open letter to Tata Steel\u2019s chairman, Cyrus Mistry, in support of UK steelworkers. Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThe steel industry is of vital strategic importance to the economy, but it is hanging by the thinnest of threads. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of challenging global conditions for the steel sector, it is crucial that the government is prepared to act, or we risk losing yet more high-skilled jobs and potentially an entire industry which is vital to our future prosperity. \u201cSteel bosses, workers and entire communities are now looking to the government to stand ready to do all it can to play its part in safeguarding the future of steelmaking in Britain.\u201d",

However, the plant and the division it is part of are losing more than \u00a31m a day and Tata is under pressure in India to cut its losses on UK steel so that it can focus on the domestic market. </p> <p>Tata blames cheap imports of Chinese steel and high energy costs for threatening the future of its UK steelmaking. Port Talbot has already had to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/17/tata-to-cut-1000-jobs-at-steel-plants-in-wales\">bear the brunt of 1,000 job losses</a> announced in January.</p> <p>The business minister, Anna Soubry, said the government was determined to ensure that Port Talbot continues to make steel. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Soubry said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should underestimate the determination of this prime minister, and this government, to make sure that we continue not just to roll steel at Port Talbot, actually to make it there, and at Scunthorpe as well. That is our determination.\u201d</p> <p>Soubry sought to blame Vince Cable, who was business secretary under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, for failing to do enough to protect the Port Talbot plant in the past.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think Vince could have done more: sorry, but that is my view,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was appointed, the prime minister specially said to me, \u2018We have some very real problems in our steel industry, and I want you to devote a large amount of your time to solving those problems as much as you can\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Soubry said it was important to allow the Indian conglomerate to make its own decision but suggested that the government was poised to take action if the plant looked set to be closed. \u201cWe are looking at all manner of options that may or may not be available to us as a government,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>A crisis has engulfed much of the British steel industry in the past 12 months, with the Redcar steel plant, owned by Thai company SSI, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/redcar-steel-plant-to-close-with-1700-job-losses\">closing late last year with the loss of 1,700 jobs</a>.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for David Cameron conceded that no British minister was in Mumbai to monitor the progress of Tuesday\u2019s board meeting, as it emerged that the business secretary, Sajid Javid, was preparing to fly to Australia, with the future of the Port Talbot plant still hanging in the balance.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working very closely with the industry to look at ways we can help to deliver a long-term, sustainable future,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThere are already a number of steps that we have taken for the steel industry more broadly. We stand ready to work with Tata.\u201d</p> <p>She stressed that Javid, and the former Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb, who was promoted to work and pensions secretary after the resignation of Iain Duncan Smith earlier this month, had previously been liaising with the Indian company over the future of the steelworks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/port-talbot-heart-of-the-storm-battering-britains-steel-industry\">Port Talbot \u2013 heart of the storm battering Britain's steel industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While in Australia, Javid is due to address the Australian British Chamber of Commerce and meet the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to discuss issues including cybersecurity.</p> <p>Officials from the Community trade union, which represents steelworkers, reported that they had \u201cconstructive\u201d talks with senior company representatives in Mumbai. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe delegation from Community led by Roy Rickhuss, general secretary, along with Stephen Kinnock, MP for Aberavon, and Frits van Wieringen, chairman of the Tata Steel European works council, met in Mumbai with senior representatives of Tata Steel in advance of the board meeting,\u201d a spokesman for the union said.</p> <p>\u201cThe meeting was open and constructive.

      "bodyText": "Global economic uncertainty including the slowdown in China and collapsing oil prices led to the delaying of an interest rate hike in both January and March, the Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, said on Tuesday. Urging caution, Yellen said she expects \u201conly gradual increases\u201d to be warranted in the future. \u201cImportantly, this forecast is not a plan set in stone that will be carried out regardless of economic developments,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cInstead, monetary policy will, as always, respond to the economy\u2019s twists and turns so as to promote, as best as we can in an uncertain economic environment, the employment and inflation goals assigned to us by the Congress.\u201d The US central bank left interest rates unchanged two weeks ago and signaled its concerns about the economy by forecasting two further rate hikes this year, down from four at its December meeting, when the Fed raised rates from near zero for the first time in almost a decade. In her speech, Yellen pointed out that growth this year is expected to be weaker than previously thought. Additionally, she noted that meeting the Fed\u2019s employment and inflation objectives \u201cwill likely require a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate than was anticipated in December\u201d. \u201cConsidering the risk to the outlook, I consider it appropriate for the committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy,\u201d said Yellen. Caution is \u201cespecially warranted\u201d, she said, since the Fed\u2019s ability to respond to economic disturbances is limited by the low interest rates. If the economy was to improve, the Fed could readily hike interest rates. Yet, \u201cif the expansion was to falter or if inflation was to remain stubbornly low, the [Fed] would be able to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds rate back to near zero\u201d. Yellen did not mention negative interest rates in her prepared remarks. Hours before Yellen delivered her speech, the San Francisco Federal Reserve president, John Williams, said the US economy remains on track for gradual path of interest rate hikes. He added that fears over the impact of a slowing global economy and bouts of financial volatility are overdone. \u201cOthers\u2019 economic fates do not spell our own,\u201d Williams said at the National University of Singapore on a trip to Asia. \u201cMy view is, essentially, let\u2019s just stay on track. Let\u2019s not get sidelined by the noise and distraction commentary can sometimes cause.\u201d With an uptick in oil prices and a stabilizing dollar, Williams expects the unemployment rate to fall to about 4.5% by late 2016 and for inflation to return to the Fed\u2019s 2% target over the next two years. The next Federal Reserve meeting will take place on 26 and 27 April. In the weeks leading up to the meeting, even as Yellen has maintained her cautious poker face, a number of other Fed officials have voiced bullish opinions that a second hike might come sooner rather than later. Last week, the Philadelphia Fed president, Patrick Harker, said he would support a rate increase soon. \u201cI think we need to get on with it,\u201d said Harker. \u201cThis economy is really quite resilient to a lot of the headwinds \u2013 including the strong dollar \u2013 so if that continues I would be supportive of another 25 basis point rise.\u201d Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart also suggested that a hike might be coming soon. \u201cThere is sufficient momentum evidenced by the economic data to justify a further step at one of the coming meetings, possibly as early as the meeting scheduled for end of April,\u201d Lockhart said last week. While Lockhart, Harker and Williams all participate in the deliberation, they are not voting members of the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee. The St Louis Fed president, James Bullard, who is a voting member, also recently suggested that a hike \u201cmay not be far off\u201d. However, lackluster consumer spending and inflation data on Monday curbed investor bets on when the next rate rise will be. Consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of US economic activity, edged up just 0.1% in February. Furthermore, January\u2019s growth in consumer spending was revised down to 0.1% from the 0.5% growth previously reported. Inflation once again fell short of the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The rate remained at 1.7% last month, unchanged from January. Reuters contributed to this report.",

    "webTitle": "Irn-Bru maker plays down financial impact of sugar tax", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "AG Barr, the Scottish soft drinks maker best known for Irn-Bru, has reiterated its annoyance at George Osborne\u2019s sugar tax but says it expects little financial impact because it will change its recipes to adapt to the measure. The company said it was speeding up cuts to sugar levels over the next year to be ready for the introduction of the levy on soft drinks in 2018. It said it had cut the average calorific content of its drinks by 8.8% in the past four years. Based on the government\u2019s proposals, AG Barr expects at least two-thirds of its drinks to be classed as lower or no sugar by April 2018. Loyalty to sugary versions of Irn-Bru, Tizer and the Rockstar energy drink will ensure demand survives the levy, the company said. Osborne stunned drinkmakers at the budget this month by announcing a tax on drinks with added sugar. The levy, whose cost has not been decided, has two tiers, a lower band for drinks with at least 5g of sugar per 100ml and a higher rate for those with more than 8g per 100ml. Irn-Bru, which rivals Coca-Cola for sales in Scotland, claims in advertisements to be \u201cmade from girders\u201d but the drink\u2019s supposedly secret recipe includes more than 10g of sugar per 100ml. The chancellor\u2019s announcement sent AG Barr\u2019s shares down sharply along with those of other soft drink makers. When Osborne announced the tax, AG Barr said it was disappointed that the chancellor had targeted soft drink makers and not other parts of the food and drink industry with a worse record for reducing the sugar content of their products. Announcing annual results on Tuesday, Roger White, AG Barr\u2019s chief executive, said energy drinks with sugar as a key ingredient would continue to have a following after the tax was introduced, and that for standard soft drinks there would be an alternative version with reduced or no sugar. \u201cOur job is to understand and have relationships with our customers, which we have had for over 100 years, making sure we offer them choices. If they want standard Irn-Bru they can have that just as they do at the moment,\u201d White said. \u201cI would continue to be disappointed that despite the considerable voluntary initiatives and the significant progress that our industry and the company have made, a punitive levy on a specific single category has been brought out where, in stark contrast to other food and drink categories, we have been reducing sugar content and have a strong [commitment] to do so.\u201d Osborne said the sugar tax was designed to combat child obesity and raise \u00a3520m a year to support school sports and other measures for children\u2019s wellbeing. The announcement was cheered by doctors, the chief executive of NHS England and Jamie Oliver, the TV chef who had campaigned for the levy. But the food and drinks lobby said the announcement was a piece of ill-advised political theatre that would cost jobs while failing to cut obesity. AG Barr\u2019s pre-tax profit for the year ended in January was flat at \u00a341.3m, on sales down \u00a32.3m to \u00a3258.6m. Excluding exceptional items, pre-tax profit rose 7% from \u00a338.6m as the company cut costs. The company\u2019s share price closed up about 0.5% at 523p. White said revenue growth would continue to be scarce amid fierce competition and with soft drinks failing to benefit from increased spending power for consumers. Bad weather over the summer affected sales of standard soft drinks and the previously strong growth of carbonated energy drinks has tailed off while sugar-free products have been more popular.",

The levy, whose cost has not been decided, has two tiers, a lower band for drinks with at least 5g of sugar per 100ml and a higher rate for those with more than 8g per 100ml.</p> <p>Irn-Bru, which rivals Coca-Cola for sales in Scotland, claims in advertisements to be \u201cmade from girders\u201d but the drink\u2019s supposedly secret recipe includes more than 10g of sugar per 100ml. The chancellor\u2019s announcement sent AG Barr\u2019s shares down sharply along with those of other soft drink makers.</p> <p>When Osborne announced the tax, AG Barr said it was disappointed that the chancellor had targeted soft drink makers and not other parts of the food and drink industry with a worse record for reducing the sugar content of their products.<br></p> <p>Announcing annual results on Tuesday, Roger White, AG Barr\u2019s chief executive, said energy drinks with sugar as a key ingredient would continue to have a following after the tax was introduced, and that for standard soft drinks there would be an alternative version with reduced or no sugar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c17d65d0ddf3c38e3b3dc2db1a1e3f35b15c327\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c17d65d0ddf3c38e3b3dc2db1a1e3f35b15c327/0_122_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pile of sugar cubes in front of trio of soft drinks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The food and drinks lobby says the sugar tax will cost jobs while failing to cut obesity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur job is to understand and have relationships with our customers, which we have had for over 100 years, making sure we offer them choices. If they want standard Irn-Bru they can have that just as they do at the moment,\u201d White said.</p> <p>\u201cI would continue to be disappointed that despite the considerable voluntary initiatives and the significant progress that our industry and the company have made, a punitive levy on a specific single category has been brought out where, in stark contrast to other food and drink categories, we have been reducing sugar content and have a strong [commitment] to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Osborne said the sugar tax was designed to combat child obesity and raise \u00a3520m a year to support school sports and other measures for children\u2019s wellbeing. The announcement was cheered by doctors, the chief executive of NHS England and Jamie Oliver, the TV chef who had campaigned for the levy. </p> <p>But the food and drinks lobby said the announcement was a piece of ill-advised political theatre that would cost jobs while failing to cut obesity.</p> <p>AG Barr\u2019s pre-tax profit for the year ended in January was flat at \u00a341.3m, on sales down \u00a32.3m to \u00a3258.6m. Excluding exceptional items, pre-tax profit rose 7% from \u00a338.6m as the company cut costs. The company\u2019s share price closed up about 0.5% at 523p.</p> <p>White said revenue growth would continue to be scarce amid fierce competition and with soft drinks failing to benefit from increased spending power for consumers. Bad weather over the summer affected sales of standard soft drinks and the previously strong growth of carbonated energy drinks has tailed off while sugar-free products have been more popular.</p>",

The sports retailer, controlled by Mike Ashley, announced it had acquired contracts for difference \u2013 a form of derivative \u2013 relating to 12.57% of Findel\u2019s shares. That takes its total interest in Findel to 29.79% - just below the 30% level at which it would have to launch a full takeover bid. In December, Sports Direct accused Findel of underdelivering for shareholders after its attempt to put a representative on the board of the online retailer was rebuffed. Nearly 81% of shareholders who voted came out against a resolution to appoint Ashley\u2019s representative Ben Gardener at an emergency shareholder meeting. At that point, Sports Direct owned a 17.5% stake in Findel. But the board won the backing of major investors Toscafund, Schroders and River &amp; Mercantile. It is not clear whether Sports Direct, which has a history of taking strategic stakes in related companies including Debenhams and JD Sports, will make a bid. The company is under pressure to make acquisitions to meet its growth targets and some analysts believe Findel would fit the bill. Shares in Sports Direct have halved in value since the beginning of December when it admitted that sales growth was stalling and the Guardian published in investigation into pay and working practices at its warehouse in Shirebrook. Since then the company has issued a profit warning and last week was forced to clarify that profits would come in at the bottom end of previous expectations after Ashley told journalists touring the Shirebrook warehouse the company was \u201cnot trading very well\u201d. Sports Direct\u2019s share price was up nearly 4% at about 362p on Tuesday afternoon. Shares in Findel soared in September when Sports Direct first revealed its stake on hopes that the sports retailer would launch a takeover bid. Last Thursday, when Sports Direct acquired its new interest in Findel, the shares rose 25%, but the stock slipped back about 8% on Tuesday to 205p. Initially, Ashley, who owns more than 50% of Sports Direct, was thought to be keen on Findel\u2019s Kitbag operation, which sells replica football shirts. But Kitbag was sold to the US-based sports merchandise business Fanatics for \u00a311.55m in February. Analysts believe Ashley is keen to get his hands on Findel\u2019s Express Gifts division, which has a well developed financial services operation that could provide potential synergies and new potential avenues of growth.",

      "bodyText": "The business minister, Anna Soubry, has insisted the government is committed to the future of steelmaking in Britain, as the fate of the Port Talbot plant hangs in the balance. The board of Tata Steel, the owner of the Welsh plant, is meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday to decide whether to back an ambitious restructuring plan that would involve laying off hundreds of staff but keeping Port Talbot open \u2013 or mothball it altogether. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Soubry said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should underestimate the determination of this prime minister, and this government, to make sure that we continue not just to roll steel at Port Talbot, actually to make it there, and at Scunthorpe as well. That is our determination.\u201d The Port Talbot site bore the brunt of 1,000 job losses announced in January, but unless Tata presses ahead with a turnaround plan, the future of the huge plant could be in doubt. Soubry sought to blame Vince Cable, who was business secretary under the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government, for failing to do enough to protect the Port Talbot plant in the past. \u201cI think Vince could have done more: sorry, but that is my view,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWhen I was appointed, the prime minister specially said to me, \u2018We have some very real problems in our steel industry, and I want you to devote a large amount of your time to solving those problems as much as you can\u2019.\u201d Tata, which employs more than 5,000 people across Wales, blames cheap imports of Chinese steel, and high energy costs, for threatening the future of its UK steelmaking. Soubry said it was important to allow the Indian conglomerate to make its own decision but suggested the government was poised to take action if the plant looks set to be closed, saying: \u201cWe are looking at all manner of options that may or may not be available to us as a government.\u201d A crisis has engulfed much of the British steel industry in the past 12 months, with the Redcar steel plant, owned by the Thai firm SSI, closing late last year with the loss of 1,700 jobs. The PM\u2019s spokeswoman said no British minister was in Mumbai to monitor the progress of Tuesday\u2019s board meeting but the business secretary, Sajid Javid, and the former Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb \u2013 who was promoted to work and pensions secretary after the resignation of Iain Duncan Smith \u2013 had previously been liaising with Tata over the future of the Port Talbot plant. \u201cWe are working very closely with the industry to look at ways we can help to deliver a long term sustainable future,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThere are already a number of steps that we have taken for the steel industry more broadly. We stand ready to work with Tata.\u201d Javid will fly to Australia on Wednesday, where he will meet the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and attend a cybersecurity roundtable. Officials from the Community trade union, which represents steelworkers, reported they had \u201cconstructive\u201d talks with senior company representatives in Mumbai. The board meeting is expected to end by 8pm Mumbai time (3.30pm BST). A spokesman for Community said: \u201cThe delegation from Community led by Roy Rickhuss, general secretary, along with Stephen Kinnock, MP for Aberavon, and Frits van Wieringen, chairman of the Tata Steel European works council, met in Mumbai with senior representatives of Tata Steel in advance of the board meeting. \u201cThe meeting was open and constructive. The European delegates made the case for Tata to continue to support the UK business. Tata Steel representatives outlined the context of commitment to the UK business to date, financial performance and the challenging global conditions of the steel sector.\u201d More than 35,000 people have signed an open letter to Tata Steel\u2019s chairman, Cyrus Mistry, in support of the UK steelworkers. Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThe steel industry is of vital strategic importance to the economy but it is hanging by the thinnest of threads. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of challenging global conditions for the steel sector, it is crucial that the government is prepared to act or we risk losing yet more high-skilled jobs and potentially an entire industry which is vital to our future prosperity. \u201cSteel bosses, workers and entire communities are now looking to the government to stand ready to do all it can to play its part in safeguarding the future of steel making in Britain.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is expected to signal a clampdown on buy-to-let lending when it reports on the mortgage market for landlords. The Bank has been watching the buy-to-let market for some time and is concerned about the amount of money pumped into the market and its vulnerability to even a small rise in borrowing costs. Threadneedle Street\u2019s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, will on Tuesday publish a report on underwriting standards for buy-to-let mortgage lenders alongside scenarios for testing the financial strength of Britain\u2019s banks. The Bank is concerned that lenders have relaxed standards for landlords, creating conditions for a property crash. Potential measures to rein in the market include limiting the percentage of buy-to-let mortgages for each lender, tightening the terms of such mortgages or forcing lenders to use more capital for the loans. The buy-to-let market has jumped back to life in recent years with interest rates at all-time lows, making borrowing cheap and offering little return for people with money in the bank. The chancellor\u2019s stamp duty surcharge on second-home purchases, designed to cool the market, has prompted a short-term frenzy of buying before the 1 April deadline, further pushing up house prices. George Osborne said last week he was ready to give the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee further scope to restrict buy-to-let lending. Osborne told the Treasury committee: \u201cThe Bank of England and the financial policy committee have identified potential systemic risks in the large increase in the buy-to-let market ... It is highly likely we will give the FPC powers over the buy-to-let market. It is possible we can do that later this year.\u201d",
