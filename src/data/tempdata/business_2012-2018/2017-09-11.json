Research into the intensely privately guarded family offices of the super-rich found that just 10 out of 262 suffered a decline in wealth in 2016. Three-quarters [74.2%] of the families \u2013 who had an average fortune of $1.45bn (\u00a31.1bn) \u2013 increased their wealth. A further 22% reported no change to their wealth, according to a report by family office researchers Campden Wealth and Swiss investment bank UBS published on Tuesday. The average return generated by family offices \u2013 which invest and manage rich people\u2019s fortunes \u2013 came in at 7%. This compares with average interest rates of just 0.35% offered by instant-access high street bank accounts, according to the Bank of England. Dominic Samuelson, the chief executive of Campden Wealth, said 2016 was \u201cabsolutely, no question, a marked performance\u201d for the fortunes of the wealthy. \u201cIrrespective of the economic challenges, great wealth is continuing to be generated across the globe,\u201d he said. Samuelson said family offices \u2013 which were pioneered by the Rockerfellers in the late 19th century to preserve their wealth for future generations \u2013 had rebounded from average returns of 0.3% in 2015 when financial markets were in turmoil. He said the strong growth in 2016 was mostly due to booming equity markets (which made up an average of 27% of family office\u2019s investments) and successful private-equity deals. \u201cThey [family offices] are long-term investors, they\u2019ve taken slightly riskier bets and chosen to select more illiquid strategies that have delivered better returns and yields.\u201d Samuelson was unable to state how much money the most successful family offices made due to confidentiality clauses, but he said some had made considerable larger than average returns. The family offices in the survey, which have an average of $921m assets under management, are expected to make significant gains this year as well, with year-to-date increases running at 7%. He said family offices were growing in popularity among the wealthy, and estimates that there are now more than 5,000 across the world. \u201cThere is now a better understanding and knowledge of what a family office is and the role it can play in helping with transition of wealth and how to grow wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cAs well as providing support pertaining to issues of tax, estate planning and lifestyle challenges.\u201d Family offices are also used to run homes and staff of the wealthy across the world and look after private jets, superyachts and other accoutrements. \u201cWhen you talk about the ultra-high net worth [defined as those with investable assets of at least $30m] it is a fairly opaque closed market. We believe there are in the region of 5,300 family offices, with north America and Europe having the most, followed by fast growth in Asia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have families with in excess of $5bn-$10bn in the study.\u201d Of those included in the study, 44% are run by a member of the family. The average pay of chief executives was $367,000, a 10% increase on the previous year. The boss also collected an average bonus of 45% of their base salary. Just 8% of family offices were run by women. The family offices in the survey gave an average of $5.7m to philanthrophic causes last year, with North Americans giving the most at $8.4m and those in Asia-Pacfic region giving $600,000 on average.",

      "bodyText": "A late PS: America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index has closed at a new all-time high tonight. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.1%, or 26 points, to 2,488.11 points, led by insurers, other financial firms, and tech stocks. The Dow Jones posted its biggest one-day jump since March. The rally was driven by relief that Hurricane Irma appears to have caused less damage than the worst-case scenarios. Marketwatch\u2019s Barbara Kollmeyer sums up the day: Wall Street optimism was underpinned by Hurricane Irma delivering a less forceful hit on Florida than expected and North Korea failing to conduct another nuclear missile test over the weekend, reviving investor appetite for assets perceived as risky, such as equities. But...Irma has still caused terrible damage to areas such as the Florida Keys, where homes have been destroyed and people are left without power and water. In Miami, roads have been turned into rivers, even though the eye of the storm missed the City. And we still don\u2019t know the final death toll. Associated Press reports that 41 people have been killed since Irma first struck the Caribbean. And finally, European stock markets have closed in a flurry of green electronic ink, as today\u2019s relief rally runs its course. Every major indices has risen today, thanks to two factors; the absence of fresh missile tests from North Korea, and signs that Hurricane Irma\u2019s total damage will come in below forecasts. In London, the FTSE 100 finished 0.5% higher at 7413, a one-week high, up 35 points. In New York the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 233 points, or just over 1%, at 22,033. That means world markets, as measured by MSCI, are at all time highs as London\u2019s financial sector winds down for the day. Insurance companies continued to recover today - with Lancashire Holdings jumping by 10% in the City, and larger firms also recovering. David Madden of CMC Markets credits the latest news from Florida: The timing of Hurricane Irma wasn\u2019t great seeing as it quickly followed the tropical storm Harvey. Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm, and even though it has caused a considerable amount of destruction, it hasn\u2019t been as bad the markets were expecting. This also added to the bullish sentiment today, since the cost of the clean-up will be less than expected. Insurers like Aviva, Prudential and Legal &amp; General are all higher today as the payouts relating to Irma are likely to be below initial estimates. The situation in Florida remains very serious, of course, with some officials warning of a potential \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d following the massive hurricane. But in the financial markets, orange juice and cotton future prices are recovering on hopes that the economic damage will be containable.. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says there was a \u201cbuying frenzy\u201d - although London\u2019s rally was held back because the pound has rallied 0.5% agains the euro. Beauchamp adds: Today\u2019s price action marks a step change from a week ago, when fears of conflict on the Korean peninsula drove equities lower. Now normal service has apparently resumed, with triple digit gains on the Dow and the Dax. The FTSE is making heavy going of it, however, as sterling continues to gain ground versus the US dollar. The pound shows little nervousness so far ahead of a big week for UK data, and even the prospect of voting on the government\u2019s EU withdrawal bill has not deterred the buyers. The debate around that bill is raging now: So that\u2019s a good moment to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The rally on the US stock market has legs; every sector on the S&amp;P 500 index is now up on the day, with insurance firms leading the charge. Orange juice futures contracts are dropping, as traders respond to signs that Irma\u2019s won\u2019t cause as much damage to Florida\u2019s citrus industry as feared. OJ futures are down 3% today, but that still means they are 9% more expensive than a week ago. Florida is the world\u2019s second-largest orange producer, so the hurricane damage to crops will have a knock-on impact on prices. Wall Street\u2019s rally is pushing world stock levels to fresh record highs. MSCI\u2019s All Country World Index is now up 0.75% today at 483.12 points, a fresh record level. The All Country World Index tracks around 2,400 stocks traded in 47 countries, so is a good gauge of equity levels around the world. After a minute\u2019s silence to mark 9/11, trading is underway on Wall Street. And shares are rallying, matching today\u2019s gains in Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones index has gained 163 points, or 0.75%, with nearly every share rising. Travel firms such as Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival are among the top risers, reflecting hopes that Hurricane Irma will not be quite as severe as feared. Financial stocks and tech companies are also leading the way higher. The US dollar is also in favour, gaining almost 0.5% against other currencies today. Newsflash: Google has launched an appeal against the \u20ac2.4bn fine imposed by the European Union in June for abusing its dominant position in the search engine market. More here. The uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit form the EU hasn\u2019t shaken London\u2019s status as a financial powerhouse, according to a new report: The British pound is creeping higher this morning, as traders prepare for an influx of data later this week - and an interest rate decision. Sterling has nudged $1.321 against the US dollar, close to a five-week high. Tomorrow, the UK inflation rate is expected to rise to 2.8%, from 2.6% in July. That might refocus minds at the Bank of England about the possibility of raising borrowing costs from their current record low. The BoE meets on Thursday; the City doesn\u2019t expect a hike, but policymakers could hint that rates will rise faster than economists expect. Shares are expected to rally in New York, when trading begins in 90 minutes time. Rising share prices seems like an odd reaction to the devastation caused by Irma in the Caribbean and in Florida. But Wall Street had been bracing for even more damage. Our Hurricane Irma liveblog explains that Florida dodged a bullet: Florida can thank Cuba, where it did hit as a Category 5 storm, said Maue and Jeff Masters, meteorology director for Weather Underground. Irma would probably have hit Florida as a Category 5 hurricane if it had missed Cuba, Masters said. The storm briefly trekked over Cuba\u2019s low populated coast Friday evening through Saturday afternoon. That weakened Irma enough that when upper level winds from the west eroded some of the storm\u2019s top and also blew in dry air, it had the combined of effect of making Irma more ragged, Masters said. It was at that point, he said, that Irma\u2019s southwest eyewall sort of came apart, no longer a perfect circle on satellite imagery. Slightly weakened from Cuba, the storm got caught up in competing weather systems a little longer, delaying its northward right turn into Florida. And that delay pushed the track further west, making it more of a threat to Florida\u2019s west coast than its east. Cantor Fitzgerald and its affiliate, BGC Partners, are holding their annual Charity Day, raising money for a wide range of good causes. The Charity Day was set up to remember the 658 Cantor Fitzgerald workers, and 61 employees of Eurobrokers employees, who died in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, 16 years ago today. Cantor\u2019s New York headquarters was based in the North tower of the World Trade Centre. Cantor and BGC distribute 100% of their global revenues on Charity Day to the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund and dozens of charities around the world. Over in Canary Wharf, a steady stream of celebrities - and the Mayor of London - have been raising money by trying their hand at trading.... The latest word from Florida is that 5.78 million homes are currently without power, or almost 60% of the state. But despite this disruption, there is relief that Irma has weakened since making landfall, and may not wreck as much havoc as some experts estimated. Daiwa Capital Markets strategist Chris Scicluna said (via Reuters): \u201cThe good news was that the eye of Hurricane Irma took a path west of Miami and has since weakened to a Category 1 storm so that damage in Florida \u2013 whilst still severe... appears not to be quite as catastrophic as had been feared last week. And thankfully there was no bad weekend news out of North Korea either.\u201d Here\u2019s the latest: North Korea\u2019s president can take the credit for today\u2019s market rally, says Joshua Mahony of City firm IG: On a day that is largely devoid of any major economic releases of note, it is Kim Jong-Un who provides the unlikely source of bullish sentiment evident throughout global markets this morning. With North Korea celebrating the anniversary of the nation\u2019s formation over the weekend, it has come as a surprise that we did not see a third consecutive weekend test from Kim Jong-Un. But this morning\u2019s optimism could be tempered by a meeting of the United Nations later today, when the UN will vote on whether to impose new sanctions on North Korea. Mahony explains: Given that North Korea has provided one of the main drivers of volatility in recent weeks, today\u2019s UN meeting over the potential implementation of further sanctions on the country will be crucial in gauging how likely we are to see further tests in the near future. With the US pushing for an oil embargo on North Korea, the Chinese and Russian decisions will be key, where their cooperation would be a kick in the teeth for Pyongyang leadership, sparking a likely military response. Newsflash: World stock markets have just hit a record high. Shares are continuing to climb in Asia and Europe, on relief that North Korea didn\u2019t conduct another missile test last weekend. Hopes that Hurricane Irma will be less devastating than feared are also pushing equities higher, with insurance companies among the top risers today (as mentioned earlier). Munich Re, one of the world\u2019s biggest reinsurance firms, are up over 4% this morning. The All Country World Share Index calculated by data firm MSCI has gained 0.35% to 481.25 points, helped by today\u2019s gains in Asia and Europe. In London, the FTSE 100 is now up 53 points at 7431, a one-week high. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at Interactive Investor, says the City is less worried about North Korea as economists try to assess the full impact of the hurricane season. \u201dEquity markets are staging a relief rally after a less painful weekend than feared. Despite the fact that North Korea is now warning of \u2018pain and suffering\u2019 if the UN council votes for new sanctions today, investors have largely decided that the risks are more rhetoric than reality. Although Irma is still causing some problems, the impact is far less than the worst-case scenario predictions, with insurance companies topping the performance tables today as the direct financial cost of Irma is likely to be far less than feared. \u201cNevertheless, the insurance costs of this year\u2019s hurricane season are just one small part of the overall impact of Harvey and Irma, with investors and analysts now trying to work out who could be the big winners and losers from this year\u2019s savage weather. Rebuilding and reconstruction are likely to be a central theme over coming weeks with the DIY and construction industries likely to be beneficiaries. Demand for new automobiles could be affected substantially by their growing susceptibility to damage from floodwater. Oil and oil product markets remain volatile as the knock-on effects of both Harvey and Irma may affect demand and supply for some time to come. Florida is also a key supplier of agricultural produce to the US and wider market, not least orange-juice. \u201cIt is likely that the overall impact of the hurricane season will negatively affect US Q3 GDP, but boost Q4 and Q1 as the rebuilding effort gets into full swing. On the flip side, near-term inflation is likely to rise, not least as a result of higher gasoline prices. The combination of these two contrasting impacts leaves the Federal Reserve with an interesting dilemma over the remaining months of the year.\u201d Over in Greece technical teams of auditors representing the debt-stricken country\u2019s creditors are flying in to prepare the ground for what officials are hoping will be a last and problem-free bailout review. Helena Smith reports from Athens What amounts to the beginning of a third bailout review begins on a very different note. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras wants the compliance audit to be wrapped up imminently, telling delegates attending the international Thessaloniki trade fair this weekend that his leftist-led administration wants it completed \u201cwith great speed.\u201d In his annual speech outlining the economic policies his government will adopt, Tsipras emphasised what he had repeatedly said during the French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s visit to Athens last week: that \u201cGreece is turning a page\u201d with growth and development after seven years of recession. Tsipras insisted that \u201cGrexit\u201d - ejection from the eurozone - had been replaced by \u201cGrinvest\u201d, as investor interest, the key to combatting unemployment, had surged. It is a far cry from the days when the young leftist firebrand vowed to stop the sell-off of Greece. China was the guest of honour at this year\u2019s Thessaloniki fair, with more than 160 Chinese firms represented. Tsipras opened his speech saying Chinese investors were \u201cwelcome\u201d in Greece. Foreign investment, he said, was vital to tackling joblessness, with youth unemployment still running at 40% in Greece. It could also help ameliorate the brain drain that had seen the best minds leave since the country\u2019s great economic crisis began. The government hopes that the latest review will be concluded by December so that Athens can successfully exit its current bailout program on time next August. In private, however, officials are voicing fears that creditor demands may get in the way. Troubled construction company Carillion has suffered fresh upheaval; Zafar Khan, its group finance director, has left the Company with immediate effect. Shares in Carillion are down almost 5%. Khan\u2019s departure comes two months after Carillion shocked the City with a big profits warning, partly due to problems with three public-private partnerships. Gold has lost its appeal this morning, as traders pile into riskier assets. Bullion has dropped by around 1%, or $20 per ounce, to $1,335. This morning\u2019s risk-on mood is also giving the US dollar a lift. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group writes: The US dollar rebounded at the open. The greenback gained against all of its G10 counterparts, except the Canadian dollar, as Hurricane Irma weakened after hitting Florida over the weekend. Greenpeace says today\u2019s offshore wind auction is a historic moment for green energy Emma Pinchbeck of Renewable UK, a trade body, has also hailed the low price of Britain\u2019s offshore wind farms: It\u2019s early, but the renewable energy industry may be tempted to crack open the champagne. A new UK government auction has just shown that the price of producing offshore wind power has dropped dramatically, bolstering the case for investing in green energy rather than nuclear. Wind developers bid aggressively for the latest government subsidies in the auction, with the winning bidders committing to building new windfarms for as low as \u00a357.50 per MWh. In comparison, Britain\u2019s new nuclear power station at Hinkley point will cost \u00a392.50 per MWh, and take two years longer to build. My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: As well as a major boost for renewables in the UK, which have suffered from government subsidy cuts in recent years, today\u2019s auction will fuel a debate over whether ministers should rethink their commitment to new nuclear power to meet the country\u2019s carbon targets. The Green party said the results should sound the death knell for Hinkley Point C,which is currently being built by EDF in Somerset. Here\u2019s the full story: Europe\u2019s equity markets are all comfortably higher this morning, as geopolitical worries ease. City investors are hoping that Hurricane Irma may not cause quite as much economic destruction as feared. Insurance company shares are rising in early trading. Bermuda-based Lancashire Holdings has jumped by 6.7%, while Beazley (which runs several syndicates at Lloyds of London) are up 5.7%. Before the storm hit Florida, insurance companies were bracing for bills of up to \u00a3150bn. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: Investors are feeling somewhat relieved today after the most dire predictions in terms of a disaster caused by Hurricane Irma have evaporated. The damage caused by Hurricane Irma is still colossal as streets have been changed into rivers and nearly 3 million people are without any power. However, thankfully, the overall impact of Irma is falling short of prediction. It is important to keep in mind that the full damage picture will still be colossal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are rising this morning, on relief that last weekend passed without another provocation from North Korea. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has popped back over the 7,400 mark for the first time in a week, up 35 points in early trading. Other European equity indices are rising too, following a solid session of gains in Asia. Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped by almost 1.5%, with Hong Kong and South Korea close behind: Fears that North Korea would mark its 69th anniversary with another nuclear test proved unfounded ; instead Pyongyang restricted itself to more traditional celebrations. Associated Press explains: North Koreans observed the country\u2019s 69th founding anniversary with celebrations that included laying flowers and bowing at statues and portraits of past leaders. But Pyongyang did not carry out another test of its developmental intercontinental ballistic missile, as South Korea\u2019s government had warned it might do. Attention now moves to the United Nations, where the United States has called for a vote later Monday on new sanctions. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors have regained their risk appetite. There is a positive start to the new trading week after North Korea avoided further provocation during its Founding Day celebrations (despite US calls for a ban on selling it oil/gas, a clear attempt to get China to help more).... Also coming up today Insurance companies will be starting to count the cost of Hurricane Irma, as the mega storm continues to blast its way through Florida. Irma is currently heading for Tampa Bay, leaving more than three million US homes without power behind it. Experts fear that a storm surge at high tide could bring even more damage. And we\u2019ll be watching disgraced PR firm Bell Pottinger, which could drop into administration this week following the scandal of its \u201ceconomic apartheid\u201d campaign in South Africa.",

Despite the fact that North Korea is now warning of \u2018pain and suffering\u2019 if the UN council votes for new sanctions today, investors have largely decided that the risks are more rhetoric than reality. Although Irma is still causing some problems, the impact is far less than the worst-case scenario predictions, with insurance companies topping the performance tables today as the direct financial cost of Irma is likely to be far less than feared.</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, the insurance costs of this year\u2019s hurricane season are just one small part of the overall impact of Harvey and Irma, with investors and analysts now trying to work out who could be the big winners and losers from this year\u2019s savage weather. Rebuilding and reconstruction are likely to be a central theme over coming weeks with the DIY and construction industries likely to be beneficiaries. Demand for new automobiles could be affected substantially by their growing susceptibility to damage from floodwater. Oil and oil product markets remain volatile as the knock-on effects of both Harvey and Irma may affect demand and supply for some time to come. Florida is also a key supplier of agricultural produce to the US and wider market, not least orange-juice.</p> <p>\u201cIt is likely that the overall impact of the hurricane season will negatively affect US Q3 GDP, but boost Q4 and Q1 as the rebuilding effort gets into full swing. On the flip side, near-term inflation is likely to rise, not least as a result of higher gasoline prices. The combination of these two contrasting impacts leaves the Federal Reserve with an interesting dilemma over the remaining months of the year.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-11T09:17:20.869Z\">at 10.17am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59b64bbbe4b0e3ccf89ec6ca\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-11T08:50:12.771Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bailout monitors return to Greece as PM charms China</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efc7c9552d859cfac87ad50ffd4639e5fc41433a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efc7c9552d859cfac87ad50ffd4639e5fc41433a/0_205_4252_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bunch of balloons are tied to a gate next to a homeless person sleeping on the sidewalk in central Athens yesterday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bunch of balloons are tied to a gate next to a homeless person sleeping on the sidewalk in central Athens yesterday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over in Greece technical teams of auditors representing the debt-stricken country\u2019s creditors are flying in to prepare the ground for what officials are hoping will be a last and problem-free bailout review.</p> <h2>Helena Smith reports from Athens</h2> <p>What amounts to the beginning of a third bailout review begins on a very different note.</p> <p>The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras wants the compliance audit to be wrapped up imminently, telling delegates attending the international Thessaloniki trade fair this weekend that his leftist-led administration wants it completed \u201cwith great speed.\u201d</p> <p>In his annual speech outlining the economic policies his government will adopt, Tsipras emphasised what he had repeatedly said during the French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s visit to Athens last week: that \u201cGreece is turning a page\u201d with growth and development after seven years of recession.</p> <p>Tsipras insisted that \u201cGrexit\u201d - ejection from the eurozone - had been replaced by \u201cGrinvest\u201d, as investor interest, the key to combatting unemployment, had surged.</p> <p>It is a far cry from the days when the young leftist firebrand vowed to stop the sell-off of Greece. </p> <p>China was the guest of honour at this year\u2019s Thessaloniki fair, with more than 160 Chinese firms represented. Tsipras opened his speech saying Chinese investors were \u201cwelcome\u201d in Greece. </p> <p>Foreign investment, he said, was vital to tackling joblessness, with youth unemployment still running at 40% in Greece. It could also help ameliorate the brain drain that had seen the best minds leave since the country\u2019s great economic crisis began.</p> <p>The government hopes that the latest review will be concluded by December so that Athens can successfully exit its current bailout program on time next August.

New York \u2013 London\u2019s closest rival and expected beneficiary of the fallout from the UK\u2019s leaving the EU \u2013 has fallen further behind amid uncertainty about Donald Trump\u2019s views on free trade. The Z/Yen global financial centres index (GFCI), which ranks 92 financial centres, found that New York\u2019s ratings score had fallen by 24 points \u2013 the largest fall among the top 15. London\u2019s total score fell by only two points this year. \u201cInterestingly, despite the ongoing Brexit negotiations, London only fell two points, the smallest decline in the top 10,\u201d the report said. Frankfurt rises to 11 in the table from 23 a year ago, while Dublin moves to 30 from 33. Both are among the EU centres battling for business that will leave London as a result of Brexit. The issues that financial firms will consider when deciding where to move may not just be based on business factors. Sir Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, on Monday pointed to the importance of education systems when moving financiers out of the UK. \u201cThe biggest issue [in relocating staff] is schools....The capacity of international secondary schools in Frankfurt is probably the biggest question on the minds of human resources directors in London\u201d. He indicated that financiers relocating may have to leave their children at schools in the UK. His remarks on Bloomberg TV come after a speech by John Cryan, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, who also mentioned the importance of schools if Frankfurt was to win business from the UK. Cryan had said Frankfurt was the only EU centre which had the infrastructure to handle activities that had taken place in London. But, Cryan said, it was up to Frankfurt to decide how much business to take, and also pointed to the issue of schools. He said Frankfurt needed \u201cmore attractive, urban residential areas, enough international schools and a dozen additional theatres and a few hundred restaurants.\u201d Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING in Frankfurt, said international schools needed to make preparations. \u201cThis would require finding land and investors. [The] big question is whether the state government of Hessen would be willing to actually give some money as well.\u201d Davies told Bloomberg that contingency plans for the UK leaving the EU would need to be rolled out on the basis of a hard Brexit \u2013 without a trade agreement or any implementation period. \u201cThe longer it goes and the closer it gets to March 2019, you will just have to implement that. \u201cThe clock is ticking, and in the City people are making contingency plans, and at the moment they can only make them on the basis of a hard Brexit... so the longer it goes, the more likelihood it is those \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 plans will be implemented,\u201d said Davies. He said the government was going to have to start \u201cwarming up\u201d people to the fact there will be a bill for the UK to leave the EU. A number of major firms have announced their Brexit plans. Bank of America has selected Dublin as the location for some of its activities while JP Morgan Chase has bought a new office in Dublin\u2019s docklands area that can house up to 1,000 staff. Morgan Stanley has picked Frankfurt and could relocate about 200 staff there while Citi is expanding in in the German city.",

    "webTitle": "UK green energy expensive? Not any more. From now on it's cheap", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The persistent myth that green energy is expensive has been shredded by the revelation that windfarms will be built around Britain\u2019s coast far more cheaply than new nuclear reactors. New power stations in the UK today are usually only built with the certainty provided by subsidies paid through energy bills, so the record low guaranteed price awarded to the developers of three new mega offshore windfarms today is, first and foremost, welcome news for consumers. It is also good for the economy post-Brexit, for the foreign-owned developers behind the multibillion-pound projects, and the increasingly UK-based supply chain that supports them, such as Siemens\u2019 \u00a3310m wind turbine factory in Hull. But there is no mistaking the fact that the low prices, labelled \u201castonishing\u201d, \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201castounding\u201d, are terrible news for nuclear proponents. Ministers last year awarded French state-owned EDF \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour of power generated by two new reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The price is nearly twice that of wholesale power and is goldplated by being inflation-linked and written in stone for 35 years. EDF said this week that future nuclear plants, such as the new one it wants to build at Sizewell in Suffolk, would be cheaper than Hinkley. But even the most vociferous nuclear supporters think that Sizewell C and a Japanese-backed bid to build new reactors at Wylfa in Wales would not come in below \u00a380 per MWh, compared with the \u00a357.50 per MWh over 15 years for new offshore windfarms. Ironically for the party that champions free market economics, the Conservatives\u2019 commitment to a fleet of new nuclear power plants is being challenged by competition. Windfarm developers have to compete against one another in a reverse auction, ensuring the government gets the cheapest price for the low carbon power it needs. The price this time crashed so much that only \u00a3176m-a-year of the \u00a3240m subsidy pot set aside by officials will be needed. The timescales and monolithic nature of nuclear projects means it would be hard, albeit not impossible, for the government to run a competitive process for them. Playing EDF off against consortiums such as Horizon, which is behind Wylfa, is not really an option. Of course, wind power is variable, unlike the steady power provided by nuclear, so there are costs to the energy system of integrating all those new turbines. But experts say those costs are relatively negligible, especially if coupled with flexible and smart technologies such as batteries, which the government is backing with hundreds of millions of pounds. So large-scale renewable power built in the next decade will be inarguably much cheaper than nuclear. But it\u2019s not just about cost \u2013 offshore windfarms can be built quicker, too. Their modular nature means they can be built in stages, and offshore wind generally has a good track record of being built on time in the UK. The projects that won subsidies this week should be operational by 2023. By comparison, Hinkley Point C is officially slated to be operational by 2025 but EDF admitted earlier this year that it could run 15 months over schedule. And the track record of plants being built with Hinkley\u2019s reactor design is infamous: Olkiluoto in Finland is a decade behind schedule; the other, at Flamanville in France, is six years late. The price awarded to offshore windfarms is also even lower than new gas power plants, but this week\u2019s auction is unlikely to spell the death of gas, which can be built much more cheaply and quickly than nuclear. Witness the German utility Uniper publicly mulling over the idea of taking apart its gas power stations in Germany and rebuilding them in the UK. But today could be, as the trade group RenewableUK puts it, a \u201cgamechanger\u201d for ministers in charge of setting energy policy. With a major government review of the cost of energy due out in October, there are calls for Theresa May to at the very least commit to further support for offshore wind and, more radically, to drop plans for new nuclear. It\u2019s become clear which way the wind is blowing.",

The London-listed company also had to shut down its Williamson mine, the source of the stones, as \u201ccertain key personnel\u201d were questioned by the Tanzanian authorities looking into how diamonds are being valued. Shares in the company, which said it had not been made \u201cformally aware\u201d of the reason for the investigation, fell nearly 25% when the market opened, before recovering to settle at about 6% lower, down 6.2p at 83.75p. The diamonds were confiscated at Dar es Salaam airport on 31 August as they were being readied for export to Antwerp, with Tanzanian officials claiming they had been undervalued. \u201cWhile Williamson Diamonds declared in its documentation that the value of the diamonds was $14.798m, a fresh valuation done by the government established that the actual value of the diamonds is $29.5m,\u201d the finance ministry said in a statement. \u201cAmong the legal action to be taken include the nationalisation of all the diamonds seized after it was established that there was cheating involved in declaring the actual value of the minerals.\u201d Tanzania has locked horns with several foreign mining companies since the 2015 election of John Magufuli, who as president has sought to extract higher value for the country\u2019s raw materials. His government last week cited \u201cirregularities\u201d in the process by which its stake in the Williamson mine was reduced from 50% to 25%, while Magufuli has also ordered an investigation into alleged under-declaration of diamond exports. Petra said it had not been made formally aware of the reason for the investigation, although it produced several documents relating to the valuation process and royalty payments to the Tanzanian government. The company said the 71,645-carat consignment had been given a provisional value of nearly $14.8m by Tanzania\u2019s diamonds and gemstones valuation agency before being prepared for export. Receipts for the royalty payments showed it paid nearly $888,000, as well as an \u201cinspection and clearing\u201d fee of nearly $150,000. It said the final sum to be paid to the government was dependent on what it received from the sale of the gems in Antwerp, rather than the provisional valuation. \u201cThe competitive open-tender process utilised by Petra is also used by several other diamond mining companies and has a proven track record of transparent price discovery,\u201d the company said. \u201cPetra is committed to engagement with the government in order to resolve this matter and ensure that the correct information is available to all parties. \u201cThe company will be in a position to address any other concerns raised by the findings of the parliamentary investigation once it has received a copy of the report.\u201d The company said mining operations \u201care conducted in a transparent manner and in full compliance with legislation in Tanzania and the Kimberley Process\u201d. \u201cThe government has complete oversight of the diamonds produced at the mine, which are physically controlled by a number of different government representatives in conjunction with Petra from the point of recovery until the point of sale.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thursday marks the 10-year anniversary of the run on Northern Rock. The dramatis personae of that dark chapter of British economic history are unlikely to stage a reunion, so it falls to others to run through where they are now. Adam Applegarth, the former chief executive whose strategy involved pumping out 125% loan-to-value mortgages, runs a small property business and turns out for Sunderland Cricket Club 2nd XI in his spare time, boasting a batting average of 28.4. It will come as no shock that his most common method of dismissal is being caught out, just as he was by the subprime mortgage crisis. More surprisingly, he has only been stumped once and it wasn\u2019t in September 2007. Fielding statistics do not record how often he has dropped the ball. Arch-Brexiter Matt Ridley, the former chairman, suffered the ignominy of becoming a Conservative hereditary peer via that most democratic of processes \u2013 being elected by other hereditary peers. The vocal proponent of fracking was rapped over the knuckles by the Lords\u2019 standards tsar because he forgot to mention during a debate on the energy bill his personal interest in Weir Group, which makes equipment for, er, fracking. The ex-chancellor Alistair Darling, whose job it was to bail the duo out, stood down as an MP in 2015 to spend more time with his Leonard Cohen albums. Whether his record collection includes any northern rock remains a mystery. Booze and Brexit: what could go wrong? The presence of strong liquor during an argument about Brexit is unlikely to make for convivial debate, so it must be hoped that the annual Wine and Spirit Trade Association conference is a more sober affair than its name suggests. Tuesday\u2019s booze-industry shindig features a Brexit discussion panel that includes the Wetherspoons chairman, Tim Martin, among the staunchest of Leavers, and the trade law specialist Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez, half of perhaps Britain\u2019s most Europhile couple with the former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg. The do also features an interview with Lord Price, the former Waitrose boss who was named trade minister by David Cameron before the referendum but has since resigned. The conference will be the first opportunity to find out if the thought of years trotting around the globe after Liam Fox had anything to do with Price\u2019s decision. With so many fiercely held positions on show, the organisers should make sure that only sparkling water is available on stage. Otherwise delegates may find that they have paid up to \u00a3300 for the pleasure of watching the discussion descend into a fist fight, ending with panellists slurring that they\u2019re each other\u2019s best friend. Beep goes on for retailers The old clich\u00e9 is that you can gauge the health of the economy by counting the number of cranes towering over the London skyline. As far as the retail climate goes, the equivalent is surely the ringing of tills or, these days, the beeping of contactless cards. The decibel level on the high street will be closely monitored this week as Primark, Morrisons, Next and John Lewis all give updates to the market. The demographic variety among retailers with numbers to report makes for a handy cross-section of British wallets, from bargain-hunting fashionistas, to grocery shoppers, to well-heeled wedding-list buyers. Retail spending hit a two-year high in August so all the signs are pointing in the right direction for these bellwethers of the high street. The boss with most on the line is Next\u2019s Lord Wolfson. After a succession of gloomy updates, he pointed to strong summer sales last month thanks to a heatwave, sending shares in the fashion chain up 10%. But that hot spell seems like a distant memory now and analysts warn that the bumper period might have been an anomaly. Next\u2019s shares have a habit of moving up and down like a pair of tracksuit bottoms when the elasticated waistband is wearing out. Here\u2019s hoping that recent rainfall hasn\u2019t dampened shoppers\u2019 spirits.",

Fielding statistics do not record how often he has dropped the ball.</p> <p>Arch-Brexiter Matt Ridley, the former chairman, suffered the ignominy of becoming a Conservative hereditary peer via that most democratic of processes \u2013 being elected by other hereditary peers. The vocal proponent of fracking was rapped over the knuckles by the Lords\u2019 standards tsar because he forgot to mention during a debate on the energy bill his personal interest in Weir Group, which makes equipment for, er, fracking.</p> <p>The ex-chancellor Alistair Darling, whose job it was to bail the duo out, stood down as an MP in 2015 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/11/alistair-darling-start-worrying\">spend more time with his Leonard Cohen albums</a>. Whether his record collection includes any northern rock remains a mystery.</p> <h2>Booze and Brexit: what could go wrong?</h2> <p>The presence of strong liquor during an argument about Brexit is unlikely to make for convivial debate, so it must be hoped that the annual Wine and Spirit Trade Association conference is a more sober affair than its name suggests.<br></p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s booze-industry shindig features a Brexit discussion panel that includes the Wetherspoons chairman, Tim Martin, among the staunchest of Leavers, and the trade law specialist Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez, half of perhaps Britain\u2019s most Europhile couple with the former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.</p> <p>The do also features an interview with Lord Price, the former Waitrose boss who was named trade minister by David Cameron before the referendum but has since resigned. The conference will be the first opportunity to find out if the thought of years trotting around the globe after Liam Fox had anything to do with Price\u2019s decision.</p> <p>With so many fiercely held positions on show, the organisers should make sure that only sparkling water is available on stage. Otherwise delegates may find that they have paid up to \u00a3300 for the pleasure of watching the discussion descend into a fist fight, ending with panellists slurring that they\u2019re each other\u2019s best friend.</p> <h2>Beep goes on for retailers</h2> <p>The old clich\u00e9 is that you can gauge the health of the economy by counting the number of cranes towering over the London skyline. As far as the retail climate goes, the equivalent is surely the ringing of tills or, these days, the beeping of contactless cards.<br></p> <p>The decibel level on the high street will be closely monitored this week as Primark, Morrisons, Next and John Lewis all give updates to the market. The demographic variety among retailers with numbers to report makes for a handy cross-section of British wallets, from bargain-hunting fashionistas, to grocery shoppers, to well-heeled wedding-list buyers.</p> <p>Retail spending hit a two-year high in August so all the signs are pointing in the right direction for these bellwethers of the high street.</p> <p>The boss with most on the line is Next\u2019s Lord Wolfson. After a succession of gloomy updates, he pointed to strong summer sales last month thanks to a heatwave, sending shares in the fashion chain up 10%. But that hot spell seems like a distant memory now and analysts warn that the bumper period might have been an anomaly.</p> <p>Next\u2019s shares have a habit of moving up and down like a pair of tracksuit bottoms when the elasticated waistband is wearing out. Here\u2019s hoping that recent rainfall hasn\u2019t dampened shoppers\u2019 spirits.</p>",

The consumer prices index, due on Tuesday, is expected to rise to 2.8% for August, up from 2.6% in July, and close to the four-year high of 2.9% reached in June. Transport costs are likely to be one of the main drivers of higher inflation, as petrol and diesel have become more expensive in recent weeks. \u201cFor road users, petrol prices are up after the respite given by lower prices over the summer,\u201d said James Brown of consultancy firm Simon-Kucher. \u201cDriving to work cost 5% more in August and early September than last year.\u201d Wages, though, are not keeping pace. City economists predict that Wednesday\u2019s labour market statistics will show that average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.2% per year in the three months to July. This would be an improvement on the 2.1% recorded a month ago, but still means that real wages are falling. Analysts at Investec predict the UK unemployment rate could drop to 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. But they caution that there are still no sign that wage growth is taking off. Business advisers BDO have warned that the rise in employment has not yet delivered higher productivity either. Peter Hemington, a partner at BDO, explained: \u201cUK employment law is sufficiently elastic to give employers the comfort that they can flex workforces quickly as market conditions change. \u201cHowever, although new employment in the UK has increasingly consisted of proper, full-time jobs, these seem often to be low skilled and low paid.\u201d Union leaders will renew their calls for the government to lift the 1% pay cap on public sector workers, when they gather for the Trades Union Congress in Brighton. The Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, said Theresa May\u2019s administration was \u201cout of step\u201d with the national mood. \u201cAfter seven long years of pay freezes and limits on their wages, ambulance workers, school meals staff, police and community support officers and other public service employees all deserve so much better,\u201d Prentis said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s largest recruitment firms is to tear up its 60-year-old structure and become a \u201csocial enterprise\u201d with a pay cap and profit-sharing plan, in a move the family who own the company hope will inspire others businesses to follow suit. Cordant, which sends 125,000 temporary staff every year to work for 5,000 clients such as Amazon and Tesco, will announce the radical overhaul this week. Its largest shareholder, Phillip Ullmann, whose father founded the Cordant Group in 1957, said he hoped to convince clients to follow suit by improving workers\u2019 conditions, predicting a Brexit-related shortage of workers that would give low-paid staff more bargaining power. The new ethos, cemented by a change to the company\u2019s articles of association, will include a fixed limit on its pay ratio, the gap between its highest- and lowest-paid employees. Top earners will not be able to take home more than 20 times the salary of its lowest-paid staff, some of whom earn the minimum wage, effectively meaning a salary cap of \u00a3400,000. There will also be a ceiling on dividends paid to its owners, several branches of the Ullmann family, who will not be able take more than \u00a33m out of the business between them in any single year. Profit, above what is paid to shareholders, will be shared with the company\u2019s 1,500 permanent staff, while company money will be channelled into projects that \u201caddress the needs of society\u201d, Cordant said. It has yet to finalise its plans but this will include offering staff and IT systems to the NHS at cost rather than for profit, which it says will save the health service \u201cmillions of pounds\u201d. Cordant also plans to plough cash into education initiatives to help teachers and improve workplace skills. As well as overhauling its own model, the company hopes in time to convince some of its clients to adopt similar measures, such as profit shares for the low-paid temporary staff they employ via Cordant. Ullmann, who lists his favourite film as Mission Impossible, said: \u201cWith Brexit there will be a shortage of minimum wage workers so there should be more power to the workers.\u201d \u201cBrexit will focus the mind,\u201d he added. He came up with the plan after a discussion with the accountancy firm Deloitte and sought approval from fellow family members, who between them control the company. Ullmann, whose profile on the Cordant website describes him as \u201cchief energiser\u201d, said: \u201cI was a traditional capitalist. I wanted to make more money and increase the size of the wealth. \u201cNow I\u2019ve found gold dust, that\u2019s how it feels to me. It will give more satisfaction than just doing more of the same.\u201d Ullmann said the company would share some its profits with its 1,500 permanent staff, a scheme reminiscent of John Lewis\u2019s annual staff bonus scheme, and would encourage businesses that use its temporary staff to do the same. But he admitted he could not force clients such as Tesco and Amazon, which use Cordant workers in their warehouses, to come up with similar plans. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tell clients to put up wages or we won\u2019t work for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I decided what they pay, wages would be high. It\u2019s a more subtle journey than that.\u201d He said workers would also benefit from plans to give them more choice in where they work, rate temporary employers and sign up for extra shifts when they want them. But Cordant\u2019s ambitions to cap its dividend and profits could be limited by its ability to produce them, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The Uxbridge-based company made a pre-tax loss of \u00a39m last year, although it posted a profit of \u00a33.9m in 2015, and it has not paid a dividend in either of the past two years. \u201cI recognise the ladder we\u2019re trying to climb but I\u2019m not daunted by the challenges in the way,\u201d said Ullmann. \u201cWe are all in. We\u2019re not going to reverse.\u201d Cordant also has some way to go to win the hearts and minds of its workers, according to posts on the jobs website Glassdoor, which carries reviews of hundreds of employers. Some 55 reviewers gave it an average of 2.4 out of 5, a relatively low score compared to other companies.",
