The bottom line for Japanese shareholders The UK may be coming to a halt for much of this week to celebrate the Queen's diamond jubilee, but at least there's important corporate news occurring in other financial centres. The Japanese annual meeting season is apparently about to kick off, and over there investors enjoy a lively approach to governance, with shareholders putting forward their own resolutions. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of proxy voting service Manifest, is an expert on such matters and has picked out a most curious example (which she insists is not a wind-up). \"It should be stipulated in the articles of incorporation that all toilets within the company's offices shall be Japanese-style toilets, thereby toughening the legs and loins,\" reads one proposal she sends over. \"The company can surely avoid failure if they straddle over a Japanese-style toilet every day and strengthen their lower body.\" Other Japan watchers, who insist that they know about such things, also report that upmarket toilets in the country possess functions allowing the pampering of top executives' bottoms.

And our hero is in need of a stiff vodka martini. We last heard about the agent's adventures when he was stationed in Canary Wharf, fighting a losing battle to try to explain HSBC's \u00a39bn pre-crash purchase of Household, a subprime mortgage lender. Despite that disaster movie, Bond is now back, this time accepting a tricky mission in his new role of chairman of mining group Xstrata. The backstory to this adventure involves Xstrata's planned merger with Glencore and how Bond's handler (Mick Davis, chief exec) is hoping to trouser his share of \u00a3240m of retention bonuses paid simply for turning up to the office. With shareholders revolting, Bond has been tasked with a dash around the City this week in a desperate race to save his own credibility. He may also try to persuade the odd Xstrata shareholder to back the proposals too, but they are furious as the company is holding a Walther PPK to their temples by linking voting on remuneration to the merger. The chairman's only real argument is that if the executive payday gets it, so does the deal. As a line of reasoning, it's as easy to justify as Sean Connery's all-in-one towelling bathing suit in Goldfinger. Call security? We are security For your average controversial corporation, security at annual general meetings is handled by a crack team of professionals. But when you're a security company yourself - and prone to the odd gaffe such as tagging the prosthetic leg of a prisoner who then hops off - calling in the professionals might not always be an option.

      "bodyText": "It may not be a favourite of those with wide waistlines, but Inditex, owner of the Zara fashion chain, now comes in extra large. This week the La Coru\u00f1a-based fashion retailer overtook telecoms company Telef\u00f3nica and a host of beleaguered banks to become Spain's biggest listed company. With a market capitalisation of \u20ac40.5bn (\u00a332.36bn) at close of play on Friday, Inditex is now worth \u20ac300m more than Santander, the international bank, and \u20ac190m more than Telef\u00f3nica. It's another landmark for the Spanish clothing company's founder, Amancio Ortega, the world's fifth richest man, who still retains a 59% stake in the company. Ortega, the son of a railway worker, left school at 14 to work as a delivery boy for a shirt maker. In 1963, aged 27, he used his savings of 5,000 pesetas to set up Confecciones Goa with his then wife Rosalia Mera, making dressing gowns and lingerie. He opened his first store, Zara, in La Coru\u00f1a in 1975 and developed it into a global powerhouse. The company saw sales rise 10% last year to \u20ac13.8bn and made net profits of \u20ac1.9bn, up 12% on the year before, despite the global downturn. Inditex listed on the Spanish stock market in 2001 at a value of \u20ac9.1bn, and it has more than quadrupled in value since then. Now 76, the publicity-shy Ortega stepped down as head of Inditex last July and is worth about $37.5bn (\u00a325bn), according to Forbes. His empire extends to more than 5,500 stores in 82 countries and eight retail brands including Massimo Dutti, Bershka and Pull &amp; Bear. It opened its first UK store, a Zara, on London's Regent Street in 1998 and now has 95 shops across Britain. Inditex's global reach, broad appeal to shoppers at the top and bottom of the market and highly efficient business model have made its shares a safe haven for Spanish investors. News that Inditex had topped Spain's Ibex index came even as the country reported disastrous monthly retail figures, with April sales down 9.8% on the year before. Although Inditex's Spanish home market, which accounts for 25% of sales, is in trouble, most analysts and investors believe the retailer can hold steady there. With its Zara chain controlling just 6% of the market, it has the opportunity to steal share from rivals as wealthy shoppers trade down to its cheaper prices. That belief will be tested on 13 June when the company delivers its next set of quarterly results. Paul Rossington, a retail analyst at HSBC, says: \"There would have to be a substantial decline in the Spanish market before it materially impacted on Inditex. The current climate is only helping big chains like Zara.\" Inditex's shares have fallen slightly in recent months amid concerns for its stores in the struggling economies of Italy and Greece. But confidence has held up because Inditex is expanding quickly in China and other fast-growing developing markets. It has also only just begun to sell online in developed markets such as Japan and the US where it has relatively few high street shops. This year, Inditex is expected to open about 500 new stores, about half outside Europe's troubled economies. Lorna Hall, senior retail analyst at trend forecaster WGSN, says Zara's aspirational fashions ensure it has a warm reception in new markets. \"Its collections are very influenced by catwalk looks and that has a global appeal,\" she says. Inditex does not advertise. Its success relies on providing must-have fashion at relatively cheap prices. Its unusual way of sourcing its merchandise is key to maintaining a steely focus on the latest trends. The company produces a third of its clothing in Spain, where it largely controls and owns factories, a third is produced in countries nearby such as Turkey and a third in the Far East. By sourcing closer to its shops and centralising distribution in Spain, Inditex is able to take decisions on which clothing to produce and distribute much more quickly than rival stores, many of which source 70% or more of their clothing in the far-off Far East. Inditex can get a new item to the shop floor in just two weeks so that its stores are more likely to be in tune with the latest trends. Buying more goods from Europe also protected the retailer from cost rises and capacity problems at Chinese manufacturers last year and is likely do so again as wages continue to rise outside Europe over the long term. Inditex also works closely with its store managers, who feed back information about what is selling to help fine-tune the latest ranges. They can dictate what goods are sent to them, to suit their shoppers, while deliveries arrive at least twice a week, keeping the look of the stores fresh and up-to-date. That attention to detail has served Inditex well as it has spread around the world \u2013 insulating it against costly fashion mistakes in new markets.",

    "webTitle": "With $30bn, BP can find new partners after its dance with the Great Bear", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The TNK-BP joint venture has been very profitable but turbulent.  Where should Bob Dudley cast his gaze now?", 
      "body": "<p>Lord Browne was rightly called the Sun King when he was at BP \u2013 because of the huge influence he exerted as a result of his early successes, as well as the fact that he liked to be in the limelight. Early last week he was back in the media glare after talking about the need for business to shed its prejudices against the gay community.</p> <p>Just days later, one of the defining moves that created the Sun King myth ended ignominiously when his successor-but-one, Bob Dudley, threw in the towel in Russia. BP said it had received a number of \"unsolicited\" approaches which might lead to an offer for its half of the TNK-BP joint venture. It said it was minded to sell.</p> <p>Russian state-owned groups such as Rosneft and Gazprom are seen as the likely potential buyers, even though the former insisted it had made no offer. Western oil majors such as ExxonMobil and even Total of France must surely be considering the opportunity \u2013 as well as the dangers such a stake would bring.</p> <p>But the Alfa Access Renova (AAR) consortium of Russian oligarchs who control the other half of TNK-BP made it clear they will also be exercising their right to make an offer. The sale of BP's stake will not be easy, given the political skills of those wily oligarchs whose consent will be needed.</p> <p>The TNK stake has given BP a million barrels of oil equivalent a day, a third of group production and 10% of profits. The success of this business means it is also of strategic importance to Russia, so it will not be given away without the say-so of the Kremlin.</p> <p>Over the nine years of its involvement in TNK, BP has had regular rucks with either the AAR shareholders or the state. Any western buyers are likely to be extremely wary. In fact the scale of the risk now, with Vladimir Putin reinstated as president, led many equity analysts to celebrate BP's decision to exit a very profitable but turbulent joint venture.</p> <p>Better to leave now with cash in your pocket, they say, than to lose it all in a punch-up with the state \u2013 perhaps over BP's ill-fated decision to try to form a joint venture with Rosneft, which has left it facing huge compensation claims in court.</p> <p>Dudley certainly needs to do something exciting if he is to put some life back into the share price, given that his time at the top has largely been taken up by the undoing of past wrongs. The two years since the Gulf of Mexico blowout have been spent improving safety, settling with Deepwater Horizon claimants \u2013 and failing to tie up new Arctic deals in Russia or growth ones in India. Any sale money from TNK could still end up going straight to the US department of justice if negligence charges arise, but BP does not expect this to happen.</p> <p>So how could $30bn be put to good use? A move into the many new emerging oil and gas opportunities in Africa could be a starting point. Rarely a month goes by without a new discovery in Mozambique, Tanzania or somewhere along the west African coast.</p> <p>BP could certainly consider pouncing on some of the new smaller exploration companies active in the area, such as Ophir Energy or even Tullow Oil. Or could it carve out a niche as a partner to a national champion such as Petrobras in Brazil, one of the great new deepwater players.</p> <p>Some will be thinking wistfully of what the man who did the mega-mergers with Amoco in the 1990s and initiated that brave, but ultimately doomed, dance with the Great Bear would have done in these circumstances. You have to believe Browne would have thought hard about whether now was finally the time for a dramatic BP break-up.</p> <h2>'Safe haven' or no, Britannia will go down if the eurozone does</h2> <p>George Osborne has made great play of his efforts to build a safe haven from the storm raging across the channel, and been rewarded with record low gilt yields and a surprisingly resilient pound.</p> <p>But if investors' worst fears are finally realised and the eurozone splinters apart, the UK could suddenly appear dangerously exposed.</p> <p>As HSBC's David Bloom put it in a research note last week: \"If the situation were to get mildly worse, the euro will continue to fall against sterling.

      "bodyText": "Lord Browne was rightly called the Sun King when he was at BP \u2013 because of the huge influence he exerted as a result of his early successes, as well as the fact that he liked to be in the limelight. Early last week he was back in the media glare after talking about the need for business to shed its prejudices against the gay community. Just days later, one of the defining moves that created the Sun King myth ended ignominiously when his successor-but-one, Bob Dudley, threw in the towel in Russia. BP said it had received a number of \"unsolicited\" approaches which might lead to an offer for its half of the TNK-BP joint venture. It said it was minded to sell. Russian state-owned groups such as Rosneft and Gazprom are seen as the likely potential buyers, even though the former insisted it had made no offer. Western oil majors such as ExxonMobil and even Total of France must surely be considering the opportunity \u2013 as well as the dangers such a stake would bring. But the Alfa Access Renova (AAR) consortium of Russian oligarchs who control the other half of TNK-BP made it clear they will also be exercising their right to make an offer. The sale of BP's stake will not be easy, given the political skills of those wily oligarchs whose consent will be needed. The TNK stake has given BP a million barrels of oil equivalent a day, a third of group production and 10% of profits. The success of this business means it is also of strategic importance to Russia, so it will not be given away without the say-so of the Kremlin. Over the nine years of its involvement in TNK, BP has had regular rucks with either the AAR shareholders or the state. Any western buyers are likely to be extremely wary. In fact the scale of the risk now, with Vladimir Putin reinstated as president, led many equity analysts to celebrate BP's decision to exit a very profitable but turbulent joint venture. Better to leave now with cash in your pocket, they say, than to lose it all in a punch-up with the state \u2013 perhaps over BP's ill-fated decision to try to form a joint venture with Rosneft, which has left it facing huge compensation claims in court. Dudley certainly needs to do something exciting if he is to put some life back into the share price, given that his time at the top has largely been taken up by the undoing of past wrongs. The two years since the Gulf of Mexico blowout have been spent improving safety, settling with Deepwater Horizon claimants \u2013 and failing to tie up new Arctic deals in Russia or growth ones in India. Any sale money from TNK could still end up going straight to the US department of justice if negligence charges arise, but BP does not expect this to happen. So how could $30bn be put to good use? A move into the many new emerging oil and gas opportunities in Africa could be a starting point. Rarely a month goes by without a new discovery in Mozambique, Tanzania or somewhere along the west African coast. BP could certainly consider pouncing on some of the new smaller exploration companies active in the area, such as Ophir Energy or even Tullow Oil. Or could it carve out a niche as a partner to a national champion such as Petrobras in Brazil, one of the great new deepwater players. Some will be thinking wistfully of what the man who did the mega-mergers with Amoco in the 1990s and initiated that brave, but ultimately doomed, dance with the Great Bear would have done in these circumstances. You have to believe Browne would have thought hard about whether now was finally the time for a dramatic BP break-up. 'Safe haven' or no, Britannia will go down if the eurozone does George Osborne has made great play of his efforts to build a safe haven from the storm raging across the channel, and been rewarded with record low gilt yields and a surprisingly resilient pound. But if investors' worst fears are finally realised and the eurozone splinters apart, the UK could suddenly appear dangerously exposed. As HSBC's David Bloom put it in a research note last week: \"If the situation were to get mildly worse, the euro will continue to fall against sterling. But if the situation gets a lot worse, do not expect sterling to offer any refuge from a eurozone fallout.\" A euro break-up would be likely to plunge the UK into a longer, deeper recession, instead of the current shallow dip; the coalition would face a choice between missing its deficit targets or cutting faster and harder; and the banking sector would be highly vulnerable to the knock-on effects of a continental credit crunch. There may also be worse to come for the housing market, where prices have been drifting downwards for 12 months, and many analysts fear that banks have billions of pounds' worth of overvalued properties clogging up their loan books. There are already rumours in financial markets that the Treasury could be forced to unveil a revamped special liquidity scheme \u2013 the rescue scheme for banks \u2013 if the woes of the European banking sector start to infect our own lenders. Remember what happened at the onset of the financial crisis in 2008: the pound lost about a quarter of its value against other currencies, as investors calculated \u2013 rightly \u2013 that the UK, with its monster banking sector, would be severely punished. That may have been a boon for exporters, but was hardly a vote of confidence in UK economic management. Sterling's slide on Friday, after a catastrophic manufacturing survey suggested there is no sign of recovery in the offing, may have been a taste of things to come. Sorrell and WPP should note: Publicis gets more for less Now if this were a world where companies listened to their shareholders, the board of WPP would currently be preparing a mea culpa. The 30% salary rise awarded to founder and chairman Sir Martin Sorrell, would be rethought in an effort to ensure that the 40% vote against the remuneration report last year does not spiral into a full-blown no vote in Dublin on 13 June. But Sorrell and the remuneration committee, led by banker Jeffrey Rosen, appear to be in no mood to listen, preferring instead to argue that the business is operating on the international stage and needs to pay its founder as such. There is no doubt that Sorrell is highly regarded, and shareholders say they don't balk at rewarding success, but WPP has achieved a lower total return over the past five years than its French rival Publicis, whose chief executive, according to Manifest, earns less than Sorrell. It's not too late for a climbdown, but don't hold your breath.",

The managing director of the IMF does not support the British government's deficit reduction programme. Which statement is correct?\" Recently, at a press conference in the Treasury, Christine Lagarde threw her weight behind George Osborne's strategy, saying: \"When I think back to May 2010, when the UK deficit was at 11%\u2026 I shiver.\" This was remarkable public backing for our chancellor, though less remarkable when one recalls that it was Osborne who was Lagarde's crucial supporter for the IMF job. And her show of solidarity sits uneasily with other comments made recently, not only by her staff but also herself. Thus the IMF annual report on the UK stated: \"Policies to bolster demand should help close the output gap faster.\" It warned against \"weak demand that leads to persistently slow growth and high unemployment\". True, the IMF said fiscal easing should be used \"if downside risks materialise and the recovery fails to take off\", but that is precisely what has happened since it issued a similar warning over a year ago. Indeed, Lagarde herself stated bluntly: \"Growth is too slow and unemployment, including youth unemployment, is too high. Policies to bolster demand before low growth becomes entrenched are needed.\" Within a week, leading international investors in the bond market of which Osborne is so frightened were reported in the Financial Times as having indicated \"they would back heavier spending to encourage growth by governments with very low borrowing costs, warning that austerity alone will not restore their budgets to health\". We also learn that the prime minister and deputy prime minister have told the Treasury to produce a growth strategy. However, unfortunately for David Cameron, Nick Clegg and the rest of us, Osborne has staked his rapidly diminishing reputation on Plan A, in which the markets are losing faith. Now, let us return to the \"output gap\" that the IMF believes should be closed faster. If we eschew technical terms, what we are talking about is the gap between present output and the potential output of the economy that could be achieved without aggravating inflation. Younger readers may like to know that the traditional obstacles to the pursuit of expansionary policies are essentially twofold: fear of inflation \u2013 especially of what is known in the trade as \"accelerating inflation\"; and concern about the trend of the balance of payments for overseas trade \u2013 ie, Britain's ability to pay its way in the world. It seems to suit Osborne to believe the output gap is small, that we have far too much \"structural unemployment\" and that measures to stimulate demand would not only upset the bond markets, but also be inflationary. This is almost certainly baloney, and in recent weeks three high-powered economists have made a major contribution to the debate on the anti-Osborne side. The first was Professor David Miles, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, in a talk to the Society of Business Economists. He emphasised that nearly all the upward pressure on UK prices in recent years has come from commodity prices and VAT increases, \"not domestically generated pressures, which amount to 1% per annum in recent years\". Miles is sceptical of the measures of \"capacity utilisation\" that come from business surveys that suggest there is limited scope for expansion of supply, given the demand. So am I. For years I covered these business surveys and the responses about \"capacity\" were always suspiciously pessimistic. This point is also made by former City economist Bill Martin and Professor Robert Rowthorn in a fascinating new study entitled \"Is the British Economy Supply Constrained?\" They reproduce a very telling observation from US economist George Perry of the Brookings Institute. In 1973 he observed that the apparent cyclicality of economic potential arises from a bias in how businesses respond to surveys: \"Respondents 'find' capacity when output rises sharply, and 'lose' it when output slackens,\" he said. Martin and Rowthorn take issue with the Office for Budget Responsibility's view that most of the deficit is structural, not cyclical, and would not disappear as output recovered. This is important, because the OBR analysis is part of the rationalisation of Osborne's deficit strategy. This view is connected with the poor performance of productivity in recent years. But Martin and Rowthorn argue, convincingly, that \"output is well below potential because workers, while cheaper to employ, are not working to potential. More output could be produced, but not sold. There is an effective demand failure, high unemployment and, within companies, under-utilisation of the\u2026 workforce \u2013 a form of labour hoarding.\" The irony, as the authors say, is that the longer demand is depressed, the more likely it is that real structural damage will be caused to the economy. The government seems to be warming to the need for more investment, but private sector investment only takes place when business sees the prospect of rising demand.",
