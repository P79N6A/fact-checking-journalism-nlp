      "bodyText": "Retailers have warned of challenging times ahead as the weak pound ramps up their import costs and consumer confidence is buffeted by a climate of economic uncertainty as the UK embarks on Brexit negotiations. The industry\u2019s main trade group, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), took only limited solace from its monthly figures showing strong food sales giving a boost to retailers\u2019 takings last month by making up for a drop in demand for clothing during September\u2019s heatwave. Underscoring the volatile pattern of recent months, the latest snapshot of high street and online spending showed like-for-like sales were up 0.4% on the year in September, a turnaround from August\u2019s 0.9% drop. Sales growth was capped by warm weather \u2013 including the hottest September day since 1911 \u2013 which dented appetite for several products, including autumn clothes, flu medicines and duvets. The small recovery in sales follows news that consumer confidence continued to recover last month, but the BRC said it was too soon to say June\u2019s vote to leave the EU was not affecting household spending. \u201cWhile this month\u2019s sales figures may add to the impression that Brexit impacts have been brushed off, it is still too early to judge as we have not yet navigated the roughest waters,\u201d said Rachel Lund, head of retail insight and analytics at BRC. She said reports of businesses\u2019 reluctance to invest could slowly feed through to consumers and hurt their spending power. \u201cWe are also likely to see some upward pressure on prices as we move into 2017 as retailers increasingly feel the impact of exchange rate movements, although the level of competition in the industry may mean increases are more muted than implied by the scale of the devaluation,\u201d Lund said. The sharp drop in the pound since the vote to leave the EU has raised the prices retailers pay for imports. Sterling fell after the vote and has come under further pressure over the past week on signals from Theresa May\u2019s government that it will go for a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit deal that sacrifices single market access in favour of stricter immigration controls. On Monday the pound dropped another 0.4% against the US dollar, to $1.2380, but it was flat against the euro at \u20ac1.11. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, claimed that the \u201cmajor part of the fall\u201d in the pound to a 31-year-low had been down to a \u201cflash crash\u201d. He told parliament on Monday: \u201cThere will be lots of speculative comments in the next two-and-a-half-years that will drive the pound down and up and down and up and there is little we can do about that.\u201d The small silver lining for retailers from the pound\u2019s drop has been an influx of bargain-hungry foreign tourists keen to pick up luxury items. The BRC said the jewellery and watches category enjoyed another record performance last month. But on the whole, the weak pound was added to pressures on retailers and the BRC fears their costs will be further inflated if the government fails to negotiate a Brexit deal that allows easy access to European markets. The BRC has joined other business groups in warning the government over the potential economic costs of a hard Brexit deal. The BRC said prices of consumer staples such as food and clothes will shoot up if the UK has to fall back on World Trade Organisation rules. While leaving the EU and potentially the single market could offer up the potential for new trade deals in Europe and beyond, there was also a significant risk from ending existing arrangements, it warned. The group fears that under WTO rules, the new tariff rates on imports from the EU would be highest for food and clothing. \u201cThe average duty on meat imports could be as high as 27%, while clothing and footwear would attract tariffs of 11-16% versus the current zero-rating for all EU imports,\u201d the trade group said as it launched its A Fair Brexit for Consumers campaign on Monday. But the Economists for Brexit pressure group said analysis failed to recognise that leaving the single market and \u201cembracing\u201d unilateral free trade would allow the UK to cut tariffs altogether, which would in turn reduce the cost of consumer goods. \u201cOur forecasts show that this will reduce consumer prices by an average of 8%,\u201d said the group\u2019s co-chair Patrick Minford. In the near-term, consumer spending remains the main driver of economic growth in the UK, helped for now by low unemployment, record low interest rates and relatively low inflation. Separate figures from Barclaycard will bolster hopes that the trend can continue. They showed spending was buoyant last month as people splashed out on pub meals in the hot weather and as consumer confidence picked up \u2013 albeit based on a survey before the Conservative party conference fanned fears over a hard Brexit. Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of credit and debit card transactions, showed spending rose 4.2% on the year in September, making it the joint-strongest month for growth this year after the same increase in August. Consumer confidence was the highest since Barclaycard began tracking it in 2014, with 48% of the 2,000 people polled between 23 and 28 September saying they felt upbeat about the UK economy, a rise from 34% who felt that way before the EU referendum vote in June.",

      "bodyText": "The UK has recorded its biggest-ever month for tourist visits after the referendum-related slump in the pound lured 3.8 million people to British shores in July. In the highest month ever for inbound tourism, overseas visitors spent \u00a32.5bn \u2013 4% more than last year, according to new figures from the tourism agency VisitBritain. The sudden currency depreciation triggered by the result of the June referendum vote has left sterling hovering at its lowest level against the dollar for more than 30 years. This has turned the UK into a relatively cheaper destination for millions of foreign travellers wanting to shop for luxury goods or visit attractions such as the Lake District or Buckingham Palace. Announcing the figures at the the launch of the agency\u2019s 2015-16 annual review, VisitBritain said the July boost was continuing a long-term pattern of growth which in 2015 saw a record 36.1m inbound visits to Britain and triggered total spending of \u00a322.1bn. July was also a record month for inbound visits from EU countries \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest source of visitors \u2013 with 2.3m visits, 3% up on last year as European tourists took advantage of the pound\u2019s decline against the euro in the wake of the referendum. The pound is trading at its lowest against the euro for nearly seven years. \u201cTourism is a shining star in an uncertain world,\u201d said Christopher Rodrigues, VisitBritain\u2019s chair. \u201cAs our fourth-biggest service export, and one of our fastest growing sectors, tourism\u2019s importance as a key economic driver and job creator is clear. While the talk is of trade deals with new markets, tourism is already leading the way, competing strongly in our most valuable source markets such as the US and in markets that are crucial for our future, including China.\u201d Last year visitors from the USA \u2013 Britain\u2019s most lucrative foreign market \u2013 spent \u00a33bn in Britain for the first time, while visits from China, the world\u2019s largest outbound market, increased by 46%, with spending up 18%. This meant China leapfrogged into Britain\u2019s top 10 most valuable markets, while bookings from China to the UK are up by nearly a quarter between October and December this year. VisitBritain is also launching a new marketing push in the US, as well as France and Germany, Britain\u2019s three largest and most valuable inbound visitors markets, through a partnership with online travel firm Expedia. Domestic visitors attracted by affordable staycations also spent more in England last year than ever before, splashing out \u00a319.6bn on overnight trips, up 8% on 2014. This was \u00a397.2m more than the previous year, which tourism chiefs said was down to the success of initiatives such as a major VisitEngland marketing campaign. Inbound tourism is worth more than \u00a326bn to the UK economy. In August prime minister Theresa May launched a Tourism Action Plan to try to ensure that Britain remains a top destination for visitors. UK hotel chains have reported a leap in tourist spending since the vote, while the home lettings website Airbnb said its UK-listed properties welcomed 1.6 million guests between June and August. The sharp drop in the pound has inevitably made tax-free spending attractive for overseas visitors. In August the tax-free shopping company Global Blue said visitors from Asia and the USA had been taking advantage of how much further their own currencies will go in the UK, reporting a 7% year-on-year increase in UK international tax-free shopping in July. Gordon Clark, Global Blue\u2019s UK and Ireland managing director, said the pound\u2019s fall had proved perfect timing for tourists visiting the UK this summer. \u201cThe cash injection we have seen off the back of this has been hugely beneficial for our tourism economy,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Uber\u2019s main British business paid only \u00a3411,000 in tax last year while the commission fees from thousands of drivers in the UK disappeared into a controversial tax structure in the Netherlands. The latest accounts for Uber London Ltd show the UK company\u2019s turnover doubled to \u00a323.3m last year, but all of this income was earned by providing unspecified \u201csupport\u201d to other companies within the taxi-app group, and not from driver commissions. After deducting expenses, this small subsidiary, which employs 105 staff, made a profit of \u00a31.8m and paid tax of \u00a3411,000. Meanwhile, accounts for the company\u2019s international sales hub in the Netherlands reveal that commissions from drivers in London and scores of other cities around the world were booming in 2015, pushing revenues up to $520m (\u00a3420m). This was more than seven times the figure for 2014. Passengers pay their fares directly to drivers, who automatically hand over a commission fee to Uber that ultimately appears in the group\u2019s Dutch accounts. Uber International BV is one of a handful of companies in the Netherlands that together form the core of the group\u2019s complex tax planning arrangements, helping minimise its tax bills around the world. Details about Uber\u2019s aggressive tax planning come as the group separately fights claims that it is aggressively exploiting UK employment laws. The US corporation is being sued by a group of UK drivers who say they should be classified as employees of Uber, which would allow them to receive a range of benefits. A court judgment in the case is expected to be release this month. Alex Cobham, research director at campaign group Tax Justice Network, said: \u201cUber\u2019s UK accounts confirm the extent to which major multinationals are impervious to policymakers\u2019 rhetoric, and willing to take full advantage of both the weaknesses of international tax rules and of the absence of transparency.\u201d Anneliese Dodds, Labour MEP and tax campaigner, said: \u201cCompared to the way you pay for ordinary taxis, this kind of structure [used by Uber] is ridiculous \u2026 There is quite a lot of evidence it depresses wages and taxes.\u201d In a statement, Uber said: \u201cThe vast majority of the revenue generated by our technology goes straight into the pockets of drivers who use our app and so stays in the local economy. We look forward to expanding to more cities and creating more economic opportunities in the months to come. \u201cWhile we recorded a profit here last year, globally we make a loss as we are a young company that is still expanding and investing heavily. Uber is also creating thousands of economic opportunities in every city we operate in.\u201d Uber is the latest US tech company to resist pressure from British politicians to abandon its controversial tax structure and bring its UK business onshore. In her speech to Conservative party conference this month, Theresa May said she was determined to tackle tax avoidance. \u201cIf you\u2019re \u2026 an international company that treats tax laws as an optional extra,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m putting you on warning. This can\u2019t go on any more. A change has got to come.\u201d Similar threats have been made by previous leaders. In 2013, David Cameron said: \u201cWhen some businesses aren\u2019t seen to pay their taxes that\u2019s corrosive to the public trust. Some forms of avoidance have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these are ethical issues and it is time to call for more responsibility. This is an issue whose time has come \u2026 [Multinational companies should] wake up and smell the coffee.\u201d A year later, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said: \u201cSome technology companies go to extraordinary lengths to pay little or no tax here \u2026 If you abuse our tax system, you abuse the trust of the British people. And my message to those companies is clear: we will put a stop to it.\u201d In the run-up to the 2015 general election, Osborne announced the introduction of a punitive tax on those multinationals artificially shifting revenues from Britain to overseas operations in order to lower their tax bills. However, reaction from big international businesses to this measure \u2013 known as the diverted profits tax \u2013 has been mixed. Amazon and Facebook have unwound their controversial arrangements for shifting UK sales overseas. But others, including Google, eBay and Uber, appear to have left their arrangements largely unchanged.",

    "webTitle": "In poker terms, Amaya is offering William Hill a marginal hand", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When William Hill threw out a cheeky three-way merger proposal from the Rank Group and 888 Holdings a couple of months ago, its chairman, Gareth Davis, explained robustly that the bookmaker would not be doing a deal based on \u201crisk, debt and hope\u201d. Quite right, too. Life has become tougher for William Hill over the past year, and it has lost its chief executive on the way, but there was no reason to panic. But now comes a deal the board wants to look at \u2013 a potential \u201cmerger of equals\u201d with Amaya, the Canadian company whose PokerStars website dominates the world of online poker. But, using Davis\u2019s own yardsticks, the appeal looks wobbly at best. On risk, Amaya brings at least two big ones. The more obvious is a $870m (\u00a3704m) penalty in the US state of Kentucky. Amaya is probably correct in thinking it will not end up paying anything like that sum, but one can never be sure given US authorities\u2019 past (baffling) attempts to combat online poker. The other risk is that William Hill ends up with too much exposure to unregulated markets, meaning those where gambling is either banned or the rules are so unclear that your local operation can legislated out of existence. At the moment, William Hill\u2019s exposure to unregulated territories is an admirably low 5%. After a merger with Amaya, the ratio would rise to about a quarter of the business. Big difference. On debt, Amaya would bring a bundle. The combined group\u2019s borrowings would be about 3.5 times the top-line profits. Historically, William Hill has aimed for under two times. If high levels of debt are not your bag, Amaya is a strange choice of partner. The hope element is that cross-selling will do wonders for both companies \u2013 that Amaya\u2019s poker players will want to bet on sport with William Hill, and vice versa. That seems plausible, but the degree is untested. Add it up and we can agree that Amaya looks a better gamble than the complex Rank/888 proposal, where the debt ratios would have been even higher. The Canadian company is a fearsome generator of cash and it is digital and international \u2013 qualities prized by William Hill. All the same, there\u2019s a whiff of desperation in the idea that an overdose of online poker, a game that\u2019s barely growing these days, is the thing to fire up William Hill. Note the limp reaction in the share price, up just 3%. In poker terms, Amaya is offering a marginal hand. William Hill\u2019s investors may fairly feel the self-help cards are stronger. Clock ticking on RBS inquiry The bad smell around Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s global restructuring group (GRG) refuses to go away. Lawrence Tomlinson, an adviser to then-business secretary Sir Vince Cable, was the first to allege that the unit routinely ripped off small business customers, forced healthy companies into insolvency and then bought their assets for a song. That was back in 2013. RBS has admitted it \u201cdid not always meet our own high standards\u201d when dealing with small business customers but it has always vehemently denied (and did so again on Monday) the ugly charge of crashing viable businesses for its own gain. The bank has also commissioned two inquiries, both of which cleared the bank on the central allegations. And yet material keeps coming. Witness Buzzfeed and BBC Newsnight\u2019s coverage of documents in which an RBS official wrote about a \u201cdash for cash\u201d. In the end, it is only the Financial Conduct Authority, armed with powers of investigation, that can make sense of the tale. Its inquiry was launched in January 2014 after Tomlinson\u2019s report and was initially promised by the end of 2015. That deadline came and went. This month\u2019s update from the regulator said its review has been \u201ccomplex and lengthy\u201d and that it was therefore \u201cimportant that we do not rush the final stages of this process\u201d. Well, yes, it\u2019s better to be accurate than to be quick. But the FCA is still pushing the limits of acceptability on timing. Andrew Bailey, the organisation\u2019s new boss, has hinted that he is aiming for publication by the end of this year. Better to make that a firm commitment and work some overtime. Delay has not helped small firms that may or may not be due compensation \u2013 and it\u2019s not doing much for RBS either. Mitie lessons to learn from \u2018prickly peer\u2019 Mitie Group wants you to know that Ruby McGregor-Smith is leaving of her own volition.

Life has become tougher for William Hill over the past year, and it has lost its chief executive on the way, but there was no reason to panic.</p> <p>But now comes a deal the board wants to look at \u2013 a potential \u201cmerger of equals\u201d with Amaya, the Canadian company whose PokerStars website dominates the world of online poker. But, using Davis\u2019s own yardsticks, the appeal looks wobbly at best.</p> <p>On risk, Amaya brings at least two big ones. The more obvious is a $870m (\u00a3704m) penalty in the US state of Kentucky. Amaya is probably correct in thinking it will not end up paying anything like that sum, but one can never be sure given US authorities\u2019 past (baffling) attempts to combat online poker.</p> <p>The other risk is that William Hill ends up with too much exposure to unregulated markets, meaning those where gambling is either banned or the rules are so unclear that your local operation can legislated out of existence. At the moment, William Hill\u2019s exposure to unregulated territories is an admirably low 5%. After a merger with Amaya, the ratio would rise to about a quarter of the business. Big difference.</p> <p>On debt, Amaya would bring a bundle. The combined group\u2019s borrowings would be about 3.5 times the top-line profits.

      "bodyText": "Greece is on track to receive \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.5bn) from its eurozone creditors by the end of October, after an agreement on Monday on the latest instalment of its multibillion-euro bailout. A technical hitch will delay some money, but Greece and its creditors insisted this was not a problem. Eurozone finance ministers agreed to release \u20ac1.1bn on Monday, after Athens was found to have complied with 15 reforms required for releasing the money. Ministers also gave the green light to releasing a further \u20ac1.7bn, although these funds will be held up for two weeks because of a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d. \u201cThe money will come, don\u2019t worry,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup, describing the delay as an unavoidable data-collection issue, not a political decision. The \u20ac1.1bn is to be used for paying interest on debts, while the \u20ac1.7bn is earmarked for clearing debt arrears. The agreement to release the money was welcomed by the Greek government, which secured an unprecedented third bailout, worth \u20ac86bn in August 2015, after nearly being forced out of the single currency. So far Greece has received \u20ac29bn in payments under the current bailout. As he left the meeting in Luxembourg, the Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said it had been \u201ca very good Eurogroup for Greece\u201d, with unanimous agreement that Greece had completed the reforms. The delay in approving the \u20ac1.7bn was \u201ca secondary issue\u201d, he said, as Greece did not have any imminent debt repayments. Both sides said the delay was unavoidable, because Greek officials have not finished collecting debt arrears data for September, a necessary step for unlocking the money. The eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, is expected to approve the release of the \u20ac1.7bn at a board meeting at the end of October. More than a year since it teetered on the brink of financial meltdown, Athens and its creditors are in regular talks over its compliance with the bailout terms. The reforms, known as milestones in eurozone jargon, include very precise changes to pensions, energy markets and the running of Greece\u2019s central bank and tax-collection agency. Six of the reforms concern privatisation of Greek assets, a vital condition of the July 2015 bailout deal. Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner on economic and financial affairs, praised the government led by Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for its \u201ctremendous work\u201d in carrying out \u201cdifficult reforms for the Greek economy and society\u201d. \u201cGreece has made a lot of efforts,\u201d said the French finance minister Michel Sapin. \u201cI think we must recognise those efforts.\u201d But the question of easing Greece\u2019s \u20ac311bn debt burden, worth 177% of GDP, hung over the meeting \u2013 but remained unresolved. \u201cI am not going to reopen the debt discussions in the Eurogroup every month,\u201d said Dijsselbloem, who chairs the meetings. Some ministers \u201care eager to do so. But I am not\u201d, he said. Disagreement over the long-term impact of Greece\u2019s debt burden has meant the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has refused to say whether it will get involved in the current rescue programme. Eurozone countries, led by Germany and the Netherlands, are keen to keep the Washington-based fund involved, but the IMF is yet to sign up. \u201cThe intention is for the IMF to be involved,\u201d Dijsselbloem said. \u201cThat involvement would also be financial and that is the starting point of our discussion.\u201d A spokesman for the Washington-based fund told Reuters on Sunday that it had not yet decided whether to participate, but remained \u201cfully engaged with the aim of reaching agreement on a programme that the fund can support\u201d. The fund has delayed getting involved in Greece\u2019s third rescue, because it believes the fiscal targets set for Greece by the eurozone will never be achieved without debt relief. The EU maintains the Greek economy is recovering and has promised short-term measures to ease the burden of repayments. Dijsselbloem struck an optimistic note, saying that growth and confidence were returning to the Greek economy. Economists at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have forecast the Greek economy will grow during the second half of 2016, expanding to 1.9% GDP growth in 2017. But the effects of the devastating six-year recession have been slow to dissipate. Unemployment remains the highest in Europe: 1.12 million people, 23% of the workforce, cannot find a job. Although young people are far more likely to be out of work, unemployment is rising for the over-55s, as older people are pushed out of the labour market in favour of younger, cheaper employees. Greece is also grappling with the migrant and refugee crisis, with more than 60,000 people stranded in Greece, after a succession of Balkan and central European countries closed their borders last year. The OECD estimates the migrant crisis cost Greece 0.4% of GDP in 2015 and suggests this could rise this year.",

He responded to a growing international fear of slowing productivity by advocating a suite of policies including free trade, increased competition and a tax system that doesn\u2019t penalise \u201clegitimate risk\u201d. Parkinson, the secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and former Treasury secretary, made the comments in a speech to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia event in Canberra on Monday. Australia\u2019s chief bureaucrat said the future of the country will be determined \u201cby the resourcefulness of its people, not the resources lying under it\u201d. Parkinson noted that in advanced countries, including Australia, growth in incomes has \u201cslowed markedly, with impacts on living standards and fiscal positions\u201d. By looking at multi-factor productivity, we can measure the rate of innovation in products and the processes for making them, he said. Parkinson warned that between the 1990s and 2000s average annual growth in multi-factor productivity fell by around a percentage point across several advanced economies and was barely positive in Australia over the past decade. Even when mining and utilities sectors are excluded, multi-factor productivity growth had \u201cfallen significantly over the past decade\u201d with 10 of 14 Australian market-sector industries recorded lower productivity growth over the past decade than the previous one. Parkinson examined a number of theories, including that productivity growth is slowing globally because the revolution in communications and information technology has not improved innovation as much as was once thought. The trend might be reversed when current technologies reached their productive potential, he suggested. \u201cIndeed, the prime minister has noted that in many cases we overestimate the short-term impact of an innovation and underestimate its long-term impact.\u201d But he concluded we \u201cjust do not know whether technological advance is speeding up or slowing down\u201d. Another explanation could be that ideas are not being taken up as quickly, he said, citing evidence that companies had fallen further behind those at the frontier of innovation. Parkinson said the government could boost innovation by using intellectual property law to encourage rather than restrict new ideas, increasing access to data, and not penalising risk through the tax system. He said sometimes businesses failed after taking a \u201clegitimate risk\u201d and the government should avoid imposing costs like when \u201cbankruptcy penalises those able to start again or when the tax system fails to give due recognition for tax losses\u201d. Governments also needed to stop anti-competitive behaviour because it \u201cfavours incumbents over more potentially innovative\u201d and to stop protecting loss-making industries which \u201cstop resources flowing to more innovative ones\u201d. \u201cEven where we allow government services to be uncontested and directed more by employee interests, rather than consumer interests, we most likely harm innovation.\u201d Parkinson said business should do their part by improving management practices. One analysis found if Australian manufacturing firms lifted to the average level in the US it would raise the level of productivity in Australian manufacturing by about 8%, he said. \u201cOpen trade, investment, modern communication and data technologies vastly open up the scope for innovative growth across our economy.\u201d \u201cThose industries and businesses that are international in their outlook, have hooked into global supply chains, embraced change and adapted to the challenges will remain competitive.\u201d Parkinson said businesses could not only survive but thrive by tapping into global markets but industries that didn\u2019t face trade competition, such as the aged-care sector, would also need to improve their multi-factor productivity. He concluded by saying that \u2013 in Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s words \u2013 \u201cdoing things better and smarter\u201d was the \u201cmain game\u201d in improving living standards.",

      "bodyText": "Bob the Builder needs a makeover \u2013 and for once, you really can blame health and safety rules. The cartoon character\u2019s traditional yellow hard hat \u2013 a symbol of building sites across the country \u2013 is being quietly dropped. According to news reports, BuildUK \u2013 an industry body that represents some of the biggest contractors and trade associations in the UK \u2013 have created a new colour-coded scheme for hats, and yellow doesn\u2019t make the cut. From 2017, the Highways Agency, for instance, will insist that all staff working on motorways and A-roads wear hats coloured in correlation to their job position. Supervisors will be in black, slingers and signallers will wear orange, and site managers and \u201ccompetent operatives\u201d \u2013 like Bob \u2013 should be wearing a white hat (much like his safety-conscious counterpart, the Village People\u2019s David Hodo). Visitors, meanwhile, will wear blue. Happy days for photo-opp friendly Tory politicians such as George Osborne, who love a high-vis jacket and a builder\u2019s hat. Alison Rodgers from the Construction Industry Training Board, says few builders \u2013 apart from Bob \u2013 would mourn yellow hats because white ones were more ubiquitous in real life. The health and safety strategy manager says the new scheme was helpful for the co-ordination and communication needed to reduce dangers on a building site; for instance, she says, you can see at a glance those in blue hats \u201cmight not know about the hazards and risks\u201d. And the visual clues would be particularly helpful in workplaces that were a multicultural society, or where workers might have literacy issues. Hard hats have been compulsory on British building sites since 1990; rumours persist that Franz Kafka developed the first hard hat while working at an insurance company in 1912. Several hard-hat companies, however, have more prosaic claims to creating the safety wear. According to Building magazine, US manufacturer Bullard created hard hats for miners at the end of the 19th century, with their \u201chard-boiled hat\u201d made of canvas and glue, shaped on a mould and steamed. The first time construction workers were able to use them was during the creation of San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge in the 1930s. Meanwhile, the British manufacturer Centurion says it has, in fact, been making hard hats \u2013 adopting the design of the army pith helmets \u2013 since the 19th century. Fashion historian Amber Butchart, meanwhile, thinks the bowler hat is the first incarnation of the hard hat \u2013 commissioned by royal milliner Locke and Co, and created by Thomas and William Bowler in 1850 for Norfolk farmers. The idea was that they were designed to protect gamekeeper\u2019s heads from branches as they rode around country estates. Elsewhere, online, the \u201chard hat challenge\u201d has gone viral: this is less a trend to do with hierarchical colour coding and more about builders filming themselves using a shovel to launch a hat into their air and on to their head. Or more often, on to their face. Bob would not approve.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound has continued to fall against the US dollar as worries persist over the UK\u2019s economic prospects outside the EU. Sterling suffered sharp losses last week as ministers at the Conservative party conference signalled they would opt for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d settlement that sacrifices access to the single market and prioritises stricter immigration controls. Sterling was under pressure again at the beginning of this week but some calm had returned to markets. The pound fell 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.2395 on Monday. It was flat against the euro at \u20ac1.11. However, the pound\u2019s weakness boosted the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 share index \u2013 which features companies that make a significant proportion of their profits in dollars \u2013 as it closed at 7,097.5, near its record closing high of 7,104 last year. Investor nerves were strained on Friday when the pound slumped more than 8% in a \u201cflash crash\u201d in overnight trading in Asia. It dropped from $1.26 to $1.1491 in just eight minutes \u2013 a huge plunge in a market where a single cent is a big change \u2013 and recovered only some of those losses during London trading hours. Sterling still ended the week about 4% lower against the euro and US dollar. One market watcher said the currency was stabilising after the events of Friday morning. \u201cThe dust has started to settle after the flash crash overnight on Thursday saw the pound briefly trade below \u20ac1.10 and $1.20,\u201d said Chris Saint, senior analyst at City firm Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s currency service. With a quiet week ahead on the economic indicator front, he expected the pound to continue to take its cues from politics. \u201cThere is little on the domestic calendar this week to draw attentions away from ongoing worries over how politicians will handle Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, although Friday\u2019s construction output data will garner some interest,\u201d said Saint. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, claimed that the \u201cmajor part of the fall\u201d in the pound to a 31-year-low had been down to a \u201cflash crash\u201d. He told parliament on Monday: \u201cThere will be lots of speculative comments in the next two-and-a-half-years that will drive the pound down and up and down and up and there is little we can do about that.\u201d The pound\u2019s sharp fall has raised pressure on those UK firms that rely on imports, such as retailers and those manufacturers who need raw materials like plastics and metals. A weaker currency makes imports more expensive. On the other hand, it makes UK exports more competitive and some companies have reported a pick-up in overseas sales since the British vote to leave the EU in June knocked sterling. For consumers, the weak pound makes overseas holidays more expensive. There are also worries that sterling\u2019s fall will be felt at the tills as retailers pass on their higher costs. The British Retail Consortium warned on Monday that a failure to get a good trade deal would push prices up further still as shops adjust to higher trade tariffs. Currency experts expect the pound to remain under pressure against the dollar on continued fears about the UK economic outlook. Another key factor keeping the pound low against the dollar is the prospect of US interest rates being raised while the Bank of England has hinted that with economic growth weak interest rates in the UK have further to fall from their already record low of 0.25%. The dollar and US stocks were also boosted on Monday by a market view that Hillary Clinton had won the latest US presidential debate against Donald Trump. Jasper Lawler, analyst at online trading company CMC Markets, said the \u201cfascinating presidential debate left markets\u2019 favourite Hillary Clinton with a firm lead in the polls. Donald Trump was more measured in the debate but the damage had already been done after his \u2018lewd comments\u2019 video was leaked two days earlier.\u201d",

The company, which employs 63,000 people, said the search for a successor to Lady McGregor-Smith had begun late last year at her request. It has chosen Phil Bentley, who used to run British Gas and Cable &amp; Wireless Communications. McGregor-Smith, who became the first Asian woman to run a FTSE 250 company when she took the top job in 2007, tweeted: \u201cDecade at the top is the right time to step down, thanks to all my team, especially Suzanne [Baxter, the group finance director].\u201d The company did not disclose the departure terms for McGregor-Smith \u2013 who received \u00a32.6m last year \u2013 nor the terms on which Bentley had been recruited. He joins next month and takes over as chief executive on 12 December. Mitie\u2019s shares fell to a seven-year low last month after it blamed cuts to government spending, a slowdown in the economy and the vote to leave the EU for a downturn in business. The shares hit a low of 180p but have since recovered some of the loss ground to trade at 194p. McGregor-Smith said last month that the trading environment was the most uncertain she had experienced in more than 20 years in the outsourcing business. Roger Matthews, Mitie\u2019s chairman, praised her for doubling the revenue and profits at the company in her decade at the helm. Bentley, who ran Cable &amp; Wireless Communications until its takeover by the US cable group Liberty this year, said: \u201cRuby has done a brilliant job building Mitie into the admired industry leader it is today. Although it is a challenging time for the sector, we have a strong platform from which I am certain we can now prosper.\u201d In an interview with Reuters on Monday, McGregor-Smith said: \u201cAll we did three weeks ago was say our profits will be slightly lower. We didn\u2019t come out with anything too dramatic ... Of course [Bentley] will change things, as all CEOs do, but there are no planned changes at all at present. \u201c[The group has] always known, and I\u2019ve always known, that a decade was going to be the time when I said it is time for someone else to do the role.\u201d Mitie generates more than half its revenue from the private sector, and blamed the Brexit vote for making banks and other City firms delay office maintenance that would normally be commissioned in addition to cleaning contracts. The company also has cleaning contracts with a wide range of businesses including the Ambassador Theatre Group, and maintenance contracts with London and Quadrant housing trust, and provides services to care homes. McGregor-Smith, a Conservative peer, said: \u201cI would like to say a big thank you to everyone at Mitie who has helped make this such an extraordinary place to work, in particular my management team.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Right, time for a break after this morning\u2019s double-dose of live blog action. We\u2019ll be back later if anything sensational occurs..... The pound has dipped back below the $1.24 mark again. This comes after the government told reporters that MPs won\u2019t be asked to vote on the Brexit issue. Reuters has the details: The British government said on Monday that holding a second vote in parliament on the country\u2019s exit from the European Union would not be acceptable, but that lawmakers would have a role to play in scrutinising the Brexit process. \u201cParliament is of course going to debate and scrutinise that process as it goes on. That is absolutely necessary and the right thing to do,\u201d a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May told reporters. \u201cBut, having a second vote, or a vote to second-guess the will of the British people is not an acceptable way forward.\u201d The Observer reported yesterday that a cross-party alliance of MPs is pushing for a vote on the terms on which Britain leaves the EU. They argue there is no mandate for a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019, in which the UK leaves the single market. Although the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has risen today, there are still some chunky losses among UK firms. Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, picks out the big losers: \u201cIt\u2019s not a pleasant day to be a UK domestic stock. The FTSE 100 and 250 top fallers lists are littered with the likes of Travis Perkins, down 2.5%, and Pets At Home, down 3.6%, as concerns about the impact of Brexit and sterling weakness continue to bite. Banks too are having a tough morning as concerns over European, and particularly German, banks continue to rattle stock markets. RBS is the hardest faller of the FTSE 100 banks, down 1.8%. The lower sterling creeps, the more intimating those as yet unquantified, but dollar denominated, US Department of Justice fines become \u2013 reports out this morning suggesting the bank actively sought to bankrupt small businesses could mean there are yet more fines to come. Continuing the by now familiar pattern, international earners are topping the FTSE 100, which is up 0.2% overall. Strong performances from precious metal miners Fresnillo, up 1.5%, and Randgold, up 1.2%, reflect a strengthening in their underlying commodities \u2013 hinting at nervousness in the market.\u201d Jobs site Indeed.com has reported a jump in Britons searching for vacancies overseas. In the 100 days since the Eu referendum, the number of British workers looking for jobs in Ireland has risen by 20%. Australia, Canada and Germany are also popular areas: Mariano Mamertino, Indeed\u2019s EMEA Economist, says there was a surge of interest in working abroad immediately after the Brexit vote: \u201cIreland in particular has been a big winner. Not only are high numbers of Britons searching for Irish jobs, but so too are jobseekers from elsewhere in the EU. The UK has long been a magnet for international talent, but Brexit uncertainty is leading many of them to consider Ireland instead. \u201cThe UK economy has proved resilient in the first few months since the poll, with consumer confidence remaining high and the number of people in work barely changing. But a deterioration in the hiring appetite of employers - coupled with increasing talk of a Hard Brexit - and returning uncertainty over what that might mean, is now prompting many Britons who had been thinking of working overseas to job hunt in earnest.\u201d Hello again. The financial markets are in a subdued today, as US election fears add to Brexit uncertainty. The pound has now struggled back over the $1.24 mark, as investors continue to fret about Britain leaving the single market. FXTM VP of Market Research Jameel Ahmad says Round 2 of the Clinton vs Trump Presidential Debate is also worrying the City. The financial markets appear to have commenced trading for the new week under a mixed cloud, as both the constant headlines over the EU referendum outcome and the end of week slide in the price of oil weigh on investor sentiment. It is also possible that the reason for a mixed start to weekly trading could be due to investors being pre-occupied with Round 2 of the Clinton vs Trump Presidential Debate taking place overnight, where the Mexican Peso has once again strengthened significantly as the expectations of Donald Trump eventually winning the US election continue to decline. The overall market reaction to Round 2 of the Presidential Debate is far less volatile to what we experienced at the end of Round 1, although this could be because the race to who could possibly win the US election was far closer at that time. Donald Trump appears to have now managed to alienate himself from his own political party, with the feeling in the air being that the comments released from a 2005 recording has gone some distance towards self-destructing his own presidential campaign. Here\u2019s a video clip of last night\u2019s debate: The Nobel Prize for Economics has been scooped by two US-based academics for their work on contract theory. Oliver Hart (born in London) and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m (born in Helsinki) are recognised for examining how real-life contracts work, and the pitfalls they can create: The Swedish Academy for Science say: Through their initial contributions, Hart and Holmstr\u00f6m launched contract theory as a fertile field of basic research. Over the last few decades, they have also explored many of its applications. Their analysis of optimal contractual arrangements lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions. The Nobel Prize for economics is being awarded now -- follow my other liveblog for all the action: The eurozone has overcome the shock of the Brexit vote, according to new research. Germany\u2019s Sentix institute\u2019s index of investor confidence has jumped to 8.5 this month, up from 5.6 in September. That\u2019s a stronger reading than expected, taking the index back to its levels before June\u2019s referendum. Davide Serra, hedge fund manager at Algebris Investments, is still fuming about the government\u2019s proposal to make UK firms list their foreign workers: There\u2019s no respite for the pound this morning after Friday\u2019s flash crash, says Kathleen Brooks, research director of City Index. She fears that the talk of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 has spooked the market, and made the pound \u2018toxic\u2019. That\u2019s why speculators are betting against sterling, by taking up a record number of short positions (see earlier post). And does Theresa May\u2019s government care about the pound? Brooks thinks not.... The UK government don\u2019t seem to mind a weak pound. We have had no official word from the government about the pound\u2019s flash crash on Friday. For a country mired in debt a weak currency and the inflation that it will undoubtedly bring, can be a good thing. However, from a currency perspective this is a perfect storm. At the start of this week it does not look like we will regain the $1.25 handle in GBP/USD any time soon, instead we could drift down towards $1.20 over the next few weeks before the market tries to \u201cbuy the low\u201d in the pound. So bargain hunters may have to wait before making their move. While the pound slides, Mexico\u2019s peso is enjoying a strong start to the week. The Peso has jumped by 1.6% against the US dollar, which is significant as Mexico\u2019s currency has become a \u2018proxy\u2019 way of trading the US presidential election. Traders believe that Donald Trump\u2019s chances of becoming the next US president have diminished, after this happened: Shares in German lender Deutsche Bank have fallen by 3% in early trading. Investors are disappointed that the bank hasn\u2019t finalised a fine with the DoJ for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper reported yesterday that CEO John Cryan wasn\u2019t able to reach an agreement with the Justice Department during a meeting in Washington. This bodes badly for the pound.... The FTSE 100 index has opened 20 points higher, at 7064 , around 50 points shy of its record close in April 2015. The weaker pound is pushing up the share prices of companies who earn revenue in dollars (or other foreign currencies). Mining companies such as Randgold, and silver-producer Fresnillo, are leading the risers, along with engineering group Rolls-Royce and defence firm BAE Systems. Ouch. Trade-weighted sterling has just hit its lowest level since January 2009. This measures the pound against a basket of currencies. In another blow, half of Britain\u2019s business leaders expect to cut investment and hiring over the coming year, as Brexit uncertainty chews away at confidence. Here\u2019s the story: Sterling is likely to keep falling over the next year as the Brexit saga continues, says Dominic Bunning, senior FX strategist at HSBC. He predicts the pound will drop to $1.20 by the end of 2016, and $1.10 by the end of 2017. Bunning told Bloomberg TV this morning that investors are concerned with \u2018structural issues\u2019, such as Britain\u2019s gaping current account deficit, rather than interest rates or growth prospects. In theory, a weaker currency should address those structural issues and help the economy rebalance. But Bunning fears that the weak pound may not be transmitted to the real economy. As he puts it: It\u2019s hard to see Britain\u2019s goods exports picking up if we\u2019re in dispute with our biggest trading partner. Sterling is coming under fresh pressure this morning after UK business chiefs warned against crashing out of the single markets. The pound has dropped by over half a cent to $1.237, back towards the levels hit on Friday in the aftermath of the infamous \u2018flash crash\u2019. Sterling has also lost new ground against the euro, to \u20ac1.1075. The selloff comes as the head of the CBI warns that quitting the EU could destroy Britain\u2019s hopes of remaining an open economy. Carolyn Fairbairn told The Times that: \u201cWhat we have heard over the last few days, if you add up the messages in total, are signs that the door is being closed, to an extent, on the open economy, that has helped fuel investment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear from conversations we are having that the world is watching. International investors are watching. Companies here are watching. And they are reading a lot into the signals of this government about how committed they are to creating a strong economy.\u201d Fairbairn also blasted the government\u2019s proposal to force UK firms to compile a little list of their foreign workers. That plan was ditched over the weekend, following heavy criticism. More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today..... Greece\u2019s bailout is in focus today, as Eurozone finance ministers gather in Luxembourg for a Eurogroup meeting. They\u2019ll assess Athens\u2019 progress against its austerity targets, and consider whether to hand over \u20ac2.8bn in funding. This aid tranche has been on hold for a while, as the Greek government struggles to \u2018tick the boxes\u2019 set by its creditors. The meeting could be overshadowed by reports that the International Monetary Fund is considering stepping back from the Greek bailout, and merely taking on an \u201cadvisory\u201d role. Meanwhile, the City won\u2019t be able to take its mind off Brexit, and concerns that the UK is going to leave the single market. On the upside, at least we\u2019ve not suffered another flash crash today... The US presidential election race may also move the markets, after last night\u2019s sometimes brutal clash between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. If you missed it, here\u2019s what happened.... A cornered Donald Trump prowled the presidential debate stage on Sunday, threatening to jail an opponent he called \u201cthe devil\u201d in a last-ditch bid to staunch his hemorrhaging campaign hopes. Swaying malevolently behind Hillary Clinton as she parried attacks on everything from her husband\u2019s sex life to Wall Street and her foreign policy judgment, the intense Republican dominated the night but made little effort to seduce new voters. Instead, he began the night by assembling a group of women in a press conference to revisit alleged sexual assaults by Bill Clinton, before confronting his opponent hardest on her private email server. \u201cOK Donald, I know you are into big diversion tonight,\u201d shot back Clinton. \u201cAnything to get away from your campaign and how Republicans are deserting you.\u201d...

And at 9.30am, the latest Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence is released.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, as Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom enjoy a busy day of congratulations and celebrations. Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s prize winners: Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Harvard\u2019s Dani Rodrik tweets: Hart and Holmstrom\u2019s work may sound a little dry -- all that talk about CEO pay, insurance contracts and privatisations. But their contract theory work is key to understanding some contentious issues. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, explains: Take the question of how executives should be rewarded. Pay packages tend to be a mix of basic salary, bonuses and share options, with the aim of getting the best of those running companies. The best sort of contract, according to the work pioneered by Holmstr\u00f6m is one that provides the right balance of risk and incentives. It encourages top staff to innovate without being reckless. A package weighted towards bonuses might be fine for a younger executive with ambitions to be promoted. It might be less good for a chief executive approaching retirement, who might be given the green light to take risky decisions safe in the knowledge that someone else will have to clear up the mess if they go wrong. Holmstr\u00f6m clearly thinks companies have not been paying enough attention to his work. After hearing he was a joint winner of this year\u2019s prize, he said he thought bonuses were \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d and the contracts too complicated.... Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full piece: Although Hart and Holmstrom clearly merit today\u2019s award, their success means that the Nobel prize for economics has only ever been won by one women \u2013 Elinor Ostrom, in 2009. Associated Press have published more quotes from Bengt Holmstrom today: Speaking to reporters in Stockholm by telephone, Holmstrom said he felt very lucky and grateful. \u201cI certainly did not expect it, at least at this time, so I was very surprised and very happy, of course,\u201d he said. In the 1970s Holmstrom showed how a principal, for example a company\u2019s shareholders, should design an optimal contract for an agent, like the CEO. His \u201cinformativeness principle\u201d showed how the contract should link the agent\u2019s pay to information relevant to his or her performance, carefully weighing risks against incentives, the academy said. Holmstrom said his incentive to study contract theory came before he was an academic, when he was working for a company in the 1970s that tried to use computers to figure how to make strategic plans. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that the issue wasn\u2019t really about the difficulty of coming up with the best plans,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bigger issue was also to create incentives for people to give the right information that is needed for these plans and incentivize them in general.\u201d As well as the glory (and sudden interest in their research work) Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom will share 8 million kronor, or about $930,000. Paul Krugman, the US economist honoured in 2008, has warmly welcomed Hart and Holmstrom to the Nobel prize winner\u2019s club: Economist Justin Wolfers, professor at the University of Michigan, has also hailed the news: While the Economist\u2019s Stan Pignal is struck that Oliver Hart moved from the UK to the US in the 1980s Here\u2019s an excellent explainer about Hart and Holmstrom\u2019s work: Contract Theory The Academy also explain how Holmstrom pioneered the early research into executive pay: A central result, published separately and independently by Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m and Steven Shavell in 1979, is that an optimal contract should link payment to all outcomes that can potentially provide information about actions that have been taken. This informativeness principle does not merely say that payments should depend on outcomes that can be affected by agents. For example, suppose the agent is a manager whose actions influence her own firm\u2019s share price, but not share prices of other firms. Does that mean that the manager\u2019s pay should depend only on her firm\u2019s share price? The answer is no. Since share prices reflect other factors in the economy \u2013 outside the manager\u2019s control \u2013 simply linking compensation to the firm\u2019s share price will reward the manager for good luck and punish her for bad luck. It is better to link the manager\u2019s pay to her firm\u2019s share price relative to those of other, similar firms (such as those in the same industry). A related result is that the harder it is to observe the manager\u2019s effort \u2013 perhaps due to many distorting factors blurring the relationship between her effort and the company\u2019s performance \u2013 the less the manager\u2019s pay should be based on performance. In industries with high risk, payment should thus be relatively more biased towards a fixed salary, while in more stable environments it should be more biased towards a performance measure. Oliver Hart\u2019s research work has included a damning assessment of America\u2019s private prisons. He shows that the pressure to cut costs is too great, leading to unacceptable drops in quality. At the core is the issue of \u2018incomplete contracts\u2019 -- the fact that contracts aren\u2019t detailed enough to cover every nitty-gritty point. The Royal Swedish Academy say: Another application of Hart\u2019s theory of incomplete contracts concerns the division between the private and public sectors. Should providers of public services, such as schools, hospitals, and prisons, be privately-owned or not? According to the theory, this depends on the nature of non-contractible investments. Suppose a manager who runs a welfare-service facility can make two types of investment: some improve quality, while others reduce cost at the expense of quality. Additionally, suppose that such investments are difficult to specify in a contract. If the government owns the facility and employs a manager to run it, the manager will have little incentive to provide either type of investment, since the government cannot credibly promise to reward these efforts. If a private contractor provides the service, incentives for investing in both quality and cost reduction are stronger. A 1997 article by Hart, together with Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny, showed that incentives for cost reduction are typically too strong. The desirability of privatisation therefore depends on the trade-off between cost reduction and quality. In their article, Hart and his co-authors were particularly concerned about private prisons. Federal authorities in the United States are in fact ending the use of private prisons, partly because \u2013 according to a recently released U.S. Department of Justice report \u2013 conditions in privately-run prisons are worse than those in publicly-run prisons. The event in Stockholm has now wrapped up, so let\u2019s recap with the official announcement: The Prize in Economic Sciences 2016 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2016 to Oliver Hart Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA \u201cfor their contributions to contract theory\u201d The long and the short of contracts Modern economies are held together by innumerable contracts. The new theoretical tools created by Hart and Holmstr\u00f6m are valuable to the understanding of real-life contracts and institutions, as well as potential pitfalls in contract design. Society\u2019s many contractual relationships include those between shareholders and top executive management, an insurance company and car owners, or a public authority and its suppliers. As such relationships typically entail conflicts of interest, contracts must be properly designed to ensure that the parties take mutually beneficial decisions. This year\u2019s laureates have developed contract theory, a comprehensive framework for analysing many diverse issues in contractual design, like performance-based pay for top executives, deductibles and co-pays in insurance, and the privatisation of public-sector activities. In the late 1970s, Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m demonstrated how a principal (e.g., a company\u2019s shareholders) should design an optimal contract for an agent (the company\u2019s CEO), whose action is partly unobserved by the principal. Holmstr\u00f6m\u2019s informativeness principle stated precisely how this contract should link the agent\u2019s pay to performance-relevant information. Using the basic principal-agent model, he showed how the optimal contract carefully weighs risks against incentives. In later work, Holmstr\u00f6m generalised these results to more realistic settings, namely: when employees are not only rewarded with pay, but also with potential promotion; when agents expend effort on many tasks, while principals observe only some dimensions of performance; and when individual members of a team can free-ride on the efforts of others. In the mid-1980s, Oliver Hart made fundamental contri-butions to a new branch of contract theory that deals with the important case of incomplete contracts. Because it is impossible for a contract to specify every eventuality, this branch of the theory spells out optimal allocations of control rights: which party to the contract should be entitled to make decisions in which circumstances? Hart\u2019s findings on incomplete contracts have shed new light on the ownership and control of businesses and have had a vast impact on several fields of economics, as well as political science and law. His research provides us with new theoretical tools for studying questions such as which kinds of companies should merge, the proper mix of debt and equity financing, and when institutions such as schools or prisons ought to be privately or publicly owned. Through their initial contributions, Hart and Holmstr\u00f6m launched contract theory as a fertile field of basic research. Over the last few decades, they have also explored many of its applications. Their analysis of optimal contractual arrangements lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions. Contracts really, really matter, says one of our new Nobel laureates: Here are some practical examples of the issues which Hart and Holmstr\u00f6m\u2019s work can help answer: Oliver Hart has revealed that he was lying in bed, wondering if his chance had gone, when the phone burst deliciously into life.... Here\u2019s the official tweet: Q: Did you ever expect to win this prize? Bengt Holmstrom says that other people have talked about it, but he certainly did not expect it. An excited Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m is on the phone now. He confirms that he feels very happy about having his life\u2019s work recognised today. Asked what he makes of large bonuses awarded under modern-day contracts (a key part of his research), Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m said \u201cMy personal view is they are too complicated today\u201d. Taking questions from reporters, Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m also said he felt \u201cvery lucky and very grateful\u201d to the prize committee, to his family and to his colleagues. He\u2019s now taking questions in Swedish too.... In summary, Hart and Holmstrom have given us the tools to accurately examine contracts and see if people, governments and businesses are getting good deals: Oliver Hart\u2019s work has examined the issue of privatising public services -- and how governments can achieve high quality and low costs. Government ownership of key services can create \u2018weak incentives, but is private ownership better? According to Hart\u2019s work, it depends on: the extent to which cost reductions hurt quality the important of \u201cnon-contractible\u201d innovation competition between providers. It\u2019s an area of economics called \u201cincomplete contracts\u201d -- addressing the fact that agreements often don\u2019 specify actions and payments for all possible contingencies Bengt Holmstrom\u2019s work includes the thorny issue of executive pay. The Swedish Academy are explaining that it examines the issue of overpaying a CEO just for being \u2018lucky\u2019 (ie, if the oil price doubles). And tying bonuses to profits can also backfire, if it encourages short-term thinking. [given CEO pay has spiralled ahead of workers\u2019 pay in recent years, perhaps we should all pay closer attention to Holmstrom\u2019s work...] Britain can celebrate today\u2019s award, as Oliver Hart was born in London. He\u2019s spent his academic career in America, though, and is the Andrew E. Furer Professor of Economics at Harvard University. Harvard say that: Hart works mainly on contract theory, the theory of the firm, corporate finance, and law and economics. His research centers on the roles that ownership structure and contractual arrangements play in the governance and boundaries of corporations. Here\u2019s his Harvard biography. Bengt Holmstrom was born in Finland, but has also been based in the US. He\u2019s currently the Paul A. Samuelson Professor of Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who call him a: ..microeconomic theorist, best known for his research on the theory of contracting and incentives especially as applied to the theory of the firm, to corporate governance and to liquidity problems in financial crises. Here\u2019s his MIT biography Hart and Holmstrom\u2019s work is basically about balancing the needs, and demands, of the people or organisations who agree a contract. It\u2019s all about \u201crisks versus incentives\u201d - the \u2018principle agent problem\u2019. (Ie, if you have fire insurance, why do you care if it burns down). The Acadamy are explaining that Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m\u2019s work focuses on contracts such as insurance claims, salaries, property rights, etc. This may not sound terribly exciting, but this work is crucial for understanding the modern economy. Goran Hansson, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, is announcing the winner now... This year\u2019s prize is going to.... Oliver Hart of Harvard, and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m of MIT for their contributions to contract theory. The Academy says: \u201c(Their work) lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions.\u201d You can watch today\u2019s announcement at the top of this blog (or there\u2019s a web feed here) The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences has even been criticised by one former winner. Friedrich von Hayek, the Austrian/British economist whose work found favour with many right-wing politicians, argued that the award could give economists too much authority: (that\u2019s via The Economist\u2019s Soumaya Keynes, whose relative John Maynard Keynes never scooped this award (as he died before it was created). People are gathering at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, ready for the official announcement: Guessing Nobel Prize winners is devilishly tough, but the shortlist of possible winners includes: Olivier Blanchard, former top economist at the International Monetary Fund, for his work on improving economic models Edward Lazear, of Stanford University, for his work on using employee incentives to improve productivity. Marc Melitz, professor of political economy at Harvard, for his work on free trade. There are more details here: Good morning. Let\u2019s get one thing out of the way first\u2026 Yes, it\u2019s the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, not one of the \u2018proper\u2019 Nobel prizes which were dished out last week. But it\u2019s still the biggest prize in Economics, awarded to illustrious names such as John Hicks, Jan Tinbergen, John Nash, and Joseph Stiglitz. It\u2019s also a controversial award. Economics can sometimes feel like maths for argumentative people, but critics argue that its proponents aren\u2019t \u2018proper scientists\u2019, as they\u2019re trying to understand social behaviour not physical laws. Anthropologist Joris Luyendijk argued last year that putting economics on a pedestal leads to trouble\u2026 The problem is not so much that there is a Nobel prize in economics, but that there are no equivalent prizes in psychology, sociology, anthropology. Economics, this seems to say, is not a social science but an exact one, like physics or chemistry \u2013 a distinction that not only encourages hubris among economists but also changes the way we think about the economy. A Nobel prize in economics implies that the human world operates much like the physical world: that it can be described and understood in neutral terms, and that it lends itself to modelling, like chemical reactions or the movement of the stars. It creates the impression that economists are not in the business of constructing inherently imperfect theories, but of discovering timeless truths. It\u2019s a fair point\u2026. \u2026but if we\u2019ve learned one thing since the 2008 financial crisis broke, it\u2019s that the world needs a better grasp of the economic mechanisms that underpin society. And some Sveriges Riksbank Prize winners have made very significant contributions; from Nash\u2019s work on game theory to Jean Tirole\u2019s research into market power, and how to regulate big businesses. And last year\u2019s winner, Angus Deaton, was rightly recognised for his work charting global developments in health, wellbeing and inequality. The announcement is due around 11.45am in Sweden, or 10.45am in the UK....",

For example, suppose the agent is a manager whose actions influence her own firm\u2019s share price, but not share prices of other firms. Does that mean that the manager\u2019s pay should depend only on her firm\u2019s share price?</p> <p>The answer is no. Since share prices reflect other factors in the economy \u2013 outside the manager\u2019s control \u2013 simply linking compensation to the firm\u2019s share price will reward the manager for good luck and punish her for bad luck. It is better to link the manager\u2019s pay to her firm\u2019s share price relative to those of other, similar firms (such as those in the same industry).</p> <p>A related result is that the harder it is to observe the manager\u2019s effort \u2013 perhaps due to many distorting factors blurring the relationship between her effort and the company\u2019s performance \u2013 the less the manager\u2019s pay should be based on performance. In industries with high risk, payment should thus be relatively more biased towards a fixed salary, while in more stable environments it should be more biased towards a performance measure.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6fcbe4b03b4fd4fa5e8b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:47:42.021Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How Nobel prize winner shows failings of private prisons</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oliver Hart</strong>\u2019s research work has included a damning assessment of America\u2019s private prisons.</p> <p>He shows that the pressure to cut costs is too great, leading to unacceptable drops in quality. At the core is the issue of \u2018incomplete contracts\u2019 -- the fact that contracts aren\u2019t detailed enough to cover every nitty-gritty point.</p> <p>The Royal Swedish Academy say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Another application of Hart\u2019s theory of incomplete contracts concerns the division between the private and public sectors. Should providers of public services, such as schools, hospitals, and prisons, be privately-owned or not? According to the theory, this depends on the nature of non-contractible investments. Suppose a manager who runs a welfare-service facility can make two types of investment: some improve quality, while others reduce cost at the expense of quality. Additionally, suppose that such investments are difficult to specify in a contract. If the government owns the facility and employs a manager to run it, the manager will have little incentive to provide either type of investment, since the government cannot credibly promise to reward these efforts. If a private contractor provides the service, incentives for investing in both quality and cost reduction are stronger. A 1997 article by Hart, together with Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny, showed that incentives for cost reduction are typically too strong. The desirability of privatisation therefore depends on the trade-off between cost reduction and quality. In their article, Hart and his co-authors were particularly concerned about private prisons. Federal authorities in the United States are in fact ending the use of private prisons, partly because \u2013 according to a recently released U.S. Department of Justice report \u2013 conditions in privately-run prisons are worse than those in publicly-run prisons.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57fb6e66e4b03258bcac636b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-10T10:34:07.404Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The Official Announcement</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The event in Stockholm has now wrapped up, so let\u2019s recap with the official announcement:</p> <h2>The Prize in Economic Sciences 2016</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/redirect/links_out/prizeawarder.php?from=/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2016/press.html&amp;object=kva&amp;to=http://www.kva.se/en/\">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2016 to<br></p> <p><strong>Oliver Hart</strong><br>Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA</p> <p>and</p> <p><strong>Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m</strong><br>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA</p> <p><em>\u201cfor their contributions to contract theory\u201d</em></p> <h2>The long and the short of contracts</h2> <p>Modern economies are held together by innumerable contracts. The new theoretical tools created by <strong>Hart</strong> and <strong>Holmstr\u00f6m</strong> are valuable to the understanding of real-life contracts and institutions, as well as potential pitfalls in contract design.</p> <p>Society\u2019s many contractual relationships include those between shareholders and top executive management, an insurance company and car owners, or a public authority and its suppliers. As such relationships typically entail conflicts of interest, contracts must be properly designed to ensure that the parties take mutually beneficial decisions. This year\u2019s laureates have developed <em>contract theory</em>, a comprehensive framework for analysing many diverse issues in contractual design, like performance-based pay for top executives, deductibles and co-pays in insurance, and the privatisation of public-sector activities.</p> <p>In the late 1970s, Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m demonstrated how a <em>principal</em> (e.g., a company\u2019s shareholders) should design an optimal contract for an <em>agent</em> (the company\u2019s CEO), whose action is partly unobserved by the principal. Holmstr\u00f6m\u2019s <em>informativeness principle</em> stated precisely how this contract should link the agent\u2019s pay to performance-relevant information. Using the basic principal-agent model, he showed how the optimal contract carefully weighs risks against incentives. In later work, Holmstr\u00f6m generalised these results to more realistic settings, namely: when employees are not only rewarded with pay, but also with potential promotion; when agents expend effort on many tasks, while principals observe only some dimensions of performance; and when individual members of a team can free-ride on the efforts of others.</p> <p>In the mid-1980s, Oliver Hart made fundamental contri-butions to a new branch of contract theory that deals with the important case of <em>incomplete contracts</em>. Because it is impossible for a contract to specify every eventuality, this branch of the theory spells out optimal allocations of control rights: which party to the contract should be entitled to make decisions in which circumstances? Hart\u2019s findings on incomplete contracts have shed new light on the ownership and control of businesses and have had a vast impact on several fields of economics, as well as political science and law.

      "bodyText": "It sounds the driest of subjects, but the Nobel prize-winning work of Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m on the theory of contracts is key to understanding some of the most contentious political issues of the age. Take the question of how executives should be rewarded. Pay packages tend to be a mix of basic salary, bonuses and share options, with the aim of getting the best of those running companies. The best sort of contract, according to the work pioneered by Holmstr\u00f6m is one that provides the right balance of risk and incentives. It encourages top staff to innovate without being reckless. A package weighted towards bonuses might be fine for a younger executive with ambitions to be promoted. It might be less good for a chief executive approaching retirement, who might be given the green light to take risky decisions safe in the knowledge that someone else will have to clear up the mess if they go wrong. Holmstr\u00f6m clearly thinks companies have not been paying enough attention to his work. After hearing he was a joint winner of this year\u2019s prize, he said he thought bonuses were \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d and the contracts too complicated. Hart has specialised in what are known as incomplete contracts \u2013 where, for example, there is an agreement to deliver a service but it is impossible to specify precisely how this should be done. This matters because there are two, often conflicting, forces at work when a government decides whether it should run its own services or privatise them: improvements to quality and cost reduction. Hart\u2019s work shows that if the government\u2019s main priority is to improve quality it should retain control, since private providers usually have too strong an incentive to cut costs. This can result in an unacceptable drop in quality. One example cited by Hart was the US prison system, where a paper written almost two decades ago expressed concern about those in private hands. The US government now accepts that conditions in privately run prisons are significantly worse than those that are publicly owned and has decided to end their use.",

Retailers are already facing rising costs that may have to be passed on to consumers because of the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote, which has raised the price of imports. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) says prices will be increased further if the UK fails to negotiate access to Europe\u2019s single market and has to fall back on World Trade Organisation rules. The BRC says under such rules, the new tariff on imports from the EU would be highest for food and clothing. \u201cFor example, the average duty on meat imports could be as high as 27%, while clothing and footwear would attract tariffs of 11-16% versus the current zero-rating for all EU imports,\u201d the trade group said as it launched its \u201cA Fair Brexit for Consumers\u201d campaign on Monday. Falling back on to WTO rules would also increase the cost of sourcing from beyond the EU, according to the BRC. The import cost of women\u2019s clothing from Bangladesh would be 12% higher, while Chilean wine would be 14% dearer for importers. The group has written to secretary of state for international trade, Liam Fox, calling for the government strike a deal with other EU countries that does not squeeze household budgets and to focus on lowering import costs and avoiding any increase in tariffs. \u201cWe will be supporting the government through this complex and difficult process, helping them analyse how increased cost pressures on retailers could mean higher shop prices and identifying any opportunities for new trade deals that could benefit individuals and families,\u201d said BRC chairman Richard Baker. \u201cThe retail industry is the UK\u2019s biggest importer, and has huge experience of importing from every corner of the world. We will be engaged in a constructive dialogue with government that will bring our experience to bear on the Brexit talks to the benefit of everyone in the UK.\u201d The BRC is the latest business group to call on the government to strike a favourable trade deal after worries grew over the last week that ministers would sacrifice access to the single market in return for stricter controls on immigration \u2013 a settlement that has become known as \u201chard Brexit\u201d. Those concerns have pushed the pound to new 31-year lows against the dollar. The CBI director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, has said Theresa May\u2019s lurch to a hard Brexit stance risks destroying Britain\u2019s hopes of remaining an open economy.",

      "bodyText": "Uncertainty about the size of the penalty that Deutsche Bank faces from the US authorities for a mis-selling scandal a decade ago has knocked almost 4% off the share price of Germany\u2019s biggest bank. The shares fell on Monday after a frenzy of speculation that John Cryan, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, would secure a deal with the US Department of Justice while at last week\u2019s meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. But a report in Germany\u2019s largest newspaper, Bild am Sonntag, that Cryan had failed to secure a settlement with the DoJ over the sale of residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) between 2005 and 2007 hit sentiment as the German stock market opened for trading. The shares were off almost 4% at the open and were down 2.8% at \u20ac11.76 in mid-morning trading. They had crumbled to 30-year lows last month and slipped below \u20ac10 amid fears that hedge funds were reducing their business activities with the bank, which is Germany\u2019s biggest with assets half the size of the domestic economy. While Deutsche Bank has been under pressure on the stock market since the start of the year, the admission that the DoJ had suggested a $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) penalty for the RMBS scandal has caused the latest nosedive in its shares. Deutsche Bank has described it as an \u201copening position\u201d and insisted it will not pay that sum. Cryan, a Briton who has been running the bank since last year, has also been forced to insist that he has not asked for German government\u2019s help. News agency Agence France-Presse had suggested the bank might be able to settle with the DoJ for $5.4bn. Cryan has tried in the recent weeks to reassure the 100,000 staff, including about 9,000 in the UK. \u201cOur bank has become subject to speculation. Ongoing rumours are causing significant swings in our stock price. It is our task now to prevent distorted perception from further interrupting our daily business,\u201d he has said.",

    "webTitle": "Global demand for energy will peak in 2030, says World Energy Council", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global demand for energy per capita will peak in 2030 thanks to new technology and stricter government policies, the World Energy Council has predicted. In a report on a range of scenarios for global energy use, the group of academics, energy companies and public sector bodies outlined a \u201cfundamentally new world for the energy industry\u201d calling it the \u201cgrand transition\u201d. The report, launched before the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, forecast demand per person for energy \u2013 including transport fuels, heating and electricity \u2013 would begin to fall after 2030. Ged Davis, executive chair of scenarios at the World Energy Council, said: \u201cHistorically people have talked about peak oil but now disruptive trends are leading energy experts to consider the implications of peak demand.\u201d But while overall per capita energy demand would begin to fall, demand for electricity would double by 2060, the council said, requiring greater infrastructure investment in smart systems that promote energy efficiency. The \u201cphenomenal\u201d growth of solar and wind energy is predicted to continue, while coal and oil will fade from the energy mix. Solar and wind accounted for 4% of power generation in 2014 but could supply up to 39% by 2060, while hydroelectric power and nuclear are also expected to grow. But fossil fuels will remain the number one source of energy, having fallen just 5% since 1970 from 86% of energy supply to 81% in 2014. The council drew up three scenarios to assess different areas of energy use. The range of outcomes could see fossil fuels provide anything from 50% to 70% of energy by 2060, said the council, which is the UN-accredited global energy body. Under two of the scenarios, oil production will peak in 2030 at between 94m barrels per day (bpd) and 103 mb/d, although the third scenario would see it peak and plateau at 104 m/bpd for a decade from 2040. The council said moving from petrol cars to cheaper technologies such as electric vehicles would prove \u201cone of the hardest obstacles to overcome\u201d in efforts to decarbonise global energy use. Oil powered 92% of vehicles in 2014, but that is expected to fall to between 78% and 60% as electric vehicles become more popular. But the council warned that keeping global warming below 2Cwould require an \u201cexceptional and enduring effort, far beyond already pledged commitments and with very high carbon prices\u201d. Its predictions for carbon emissions vary wildly depending on the strength of efforts to tackle the problem, from a reduction of 61% by 2060 to a slight increase of 5%. Overall, the report\u2019s theme of a grand transition envisages lower population growth, radical new technologies, greater environmental challenges and a shift in economic and geopolitical power. The report was produced in partnership with consultancy Accenture Strategy and the Paul Scherrer Institute, a research centre in Switzerland. Last year\u2019s report warned of a threat to global energy networks caused by extreme weather events associated with global warming.",

      "bodyText": "Facebook\u2019s UK business generated an \u00a311.3m tax credit last year, despite the world\u2019s largest social network making a global profit of $6.19bn (\u00a34.97bn), according to the latest company accounts. The credit at Facebook UK Ltd can be offset against future tax bills and is likely to raise further questions about whether the $370bn US company is paying its fair share towards Britain\u2019s public finances. Last week, the prime minister, Theresa May, told the Conservative party conference: \u201cIf you\u2019re ... an international company that treats tax laws as an optional extra \u2026 I\u2019m putting you on warning. This can\u2019t go on any more.\u201d Until April, all Facebook\u2019s UK advertising sales were routed through its operations in Dublin, reducing the UK tax bill. Activities at Facebook UK, meanwhile, were confined to selling \u201csales support, marketing services and engineering support\u201d to other companies within the Facebook group. But in that month, Facebook\u2019s UK sales activity was transferred from Dublin to London, following the then chancellor George Osborne\u2019s introduction of a punitive rate of tax for multinationals deemed to be artificially shifting British sales overseas. Ahead of the change, turnover at Facebook UK Ltd doubled in 2015 to \u00a3210m, but this did not include a penny of the hundreds of millions of pounds in sales income that the wider group is estimated to have received from British advertisers. Losses for Facebook UK increased from \u00a328.5m to \u00a352.5m in 2015. As a result, the accounts showed that Facebook UK ended the year with a tax credit of \u00a311.3m, compared with a tax bill of \u00a34,327 in 2014. The company reported a \u00a34.2m tax charge for 2015, as well as \u00a315.5m of deferred tax credits, linked to staff share awards. Last year, Facebook UK paid employees \u00a371m in share awards. The accounts show that Facebook UK expanded dramatically last year, doubling staff and turnover, in advance of the group abandoning its controversial tax structure for British advertising sales. The number of people working for the business grew from 362 to 682 in 2015, including the addition of 200 staff within its software engineering team. Since then, a spokesman for the company said headcount has grown further, with more than 1,000 people employed by Facebook in the UK. Staff have been taken on in part to help Facebook UK sell advertising directly to major clients, who had previously dealt with Facebook Ireland. In a memo to UK staff in March, Facebook said: \u201cOn Monday, we will start notifying large UK customers that from the start of April, they will receive invoices from Facebook UK and not Facebook Ireland. \u201cIn light of changes to tax law in the UK, we felt this change would provide transparency to Facebook\u2019s operations in the UK. \u201cThe new structure is easier to understand and clearly recognises the value our UK organisation adds to our sales, through our highly skilled and growing UK sales team.\u201d As Facebook UK has taken greater control of sales to British customers, it has hired new staff, many of whom are expected to move into its new offices at One Rathbone Square in central London, when construction is finished next year. These changes mean that Facebook UK\u2019s next set of accounts are likely to show a more dramatic jump in revenues. There is also expected to be an impact on how much UK tax is paid, although a number of factors, including the \u00a311.3m tax credit, could mean that it is some time before Facebook\u2019s UK tax bill rises substantially. In a statement, Facebook said: \u201cWe are proud that in 2015 we have continued to grow our business in the UK and created over 300 new high-skilled jobs ... We pay all the taxes that we are required to under UK law.\u201d In January, Facebook warned US investors in its annual report that the UK operation could face higher tax bills in the future. \u201cMany countries in Europe ... have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations \u2026 or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. For example, in 2015, the United Kingdom enacted the diverted profits tax \u2026 which could increase our tax obligations,\u201d it said. The reaction among large technology companies to Osborne\u2019s diverted profits tax (pdf) has been mixed. Google and eBay believe that they have found a way to continue sending UK sales overseas without falling foul, but Amazon and Facebook have chosen to unwind such arrangements. When he first unveiled his efforts to tackle multinational tax avoidance in 2014, Osborne said: \u201cSome technology companies go to extraordinary lengths to pay little or no tax here ... If you abuse our tax system, you abuse the trust of the British people. And my message to those companies is clear: we will put a stop to it.\u201d",
