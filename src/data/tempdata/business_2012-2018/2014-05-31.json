The number of billionaires living in Britain has risen to more than 100 for the first time according to the latest Sunday Times rich list. Bankers, meanwhile, have refused to change their bonus-chasing ways, according to Christine Lagarde last week. Strong words from the head of the International Monetary Fund. At the same London conference, Bank of England governor Mark Carney talked about a \"heads-I-win-tails-you-lose\" culture in banking. In the housing market the cost of a modest home is rising further and further out of the reach of many people, particularly in the London bubble, where prices are increasing by the day and wealthy cash buyers are pricing others out.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "How to get the infrastructure spending show on the road", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Neither David Cameron nor George Osborne needs much encouragement to appear in a safety suit and a hard hat. In a rare double act in April the prime minister and chancellor visited a building site on the M1 to promise that more than 200 rail, road, broadband and water projects would be heading for completion this year. It was part of a bigger national infrastructure plan, a wish list of almost 650 schemes, from HS2 to better drainage on the M3. The momentum will continue in this week's Queen's speech, which is expected to contain an infrastructure bill attempting to fast-track contentious projects, including fracking. Cameron has compared this to the pioneering railways, sewers and bridges of the Victorian age. Yet spending on roads, tracks, runways and wires has shrunk in recent years. Public spending on infrastructure was worth \u00a322bn or 1.4% of GDP in 2012-13, compared with \u00a352bn or 3.4% in Labour's last year in power. And the private sector has not filled the gap. Private infrastructure orders were worth \u00a39.5bn in 2012, a 6% fall on the previous year. This leaves total infrastructure spending \"massively below the broad requirement\", according to Oxford University economist Dieter Helm, who estimates that the UK should be spending \u00a350bn a year: \"We are now a long way behind on essential infrastructure investment.\" Despite the improving economy, he says, private investors won't step in. \"Is the private sector going to generate that number on spec? No. Do you need to radically step up a gear on how the government engages? Yes.\" Some bits of infrastructure are always less attractive to private investors. Roads offer little prospect of a return: the M6 toll road is avoided by nine out of 10 lorries on the route. So the government has stepped in. Spending on the Highways Agency, the body responsible for motorways and major roads, is set to more than double, to \u00a33.7bn by 2021. But Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, says the government will have to look again at toll schemes. \"Roads should be a good opportunity for the private sector. Get the model right and the government would find a lot of pension funds and sovereign wealth funds coming in.\" Pension funds leapt at the UK's only high-speed rail line in Kent. In 2010, two Canadian pension funds, Borealis Infrastructure and Ontario Teachers' Pensions Plan, spent \u00a32.1bn on the 30-year concession to run the line. Is this a good deal for the taxpayer? \"Absolutely,\" says Nicola Shaw, chief executive of HS1. She says it has already improved the value of the business, by expanding the retail space at St Pancras, and working with developers at other stations. The attraction for the pension funds is reliable, inflation-linked returns: \"HS1 has also been a very good investment for my shareholders.\" Others are troubled by how easily the government has let go of vital infrastructure. Infrastructure consultant Martin Blaiklock argues that planning is hobbled by the way utilities are owned by distant shareholders and governments. Foreign pension funds or sovereign wealth funds own 91% of Heathrow, 100% of Gatwick, 70% of UK ports and 60% of water companies. Of the UK's big six energy firms, four have no UK directors. \"Government is often unable to direct what is built and by whom,\" says Blaiklock. So why have British pension funds not stepped in? Some say the fragmented structure of the UK industry leaves it lacking vital experience. Others disagree. \"The problem is the availability of the right kind of infrastructure investment,\" says Alan Rubenstein of the Pension Protection Fund, which manages \u00a316bn in assets. \"What you really want is a long-term cashflow-focused approach, not only long-term and linked to inflation.\" The PPF is looking for \"vehicles with long-term cashflows with a real yield of 3-5%, with less risk and less gearing\". With pension funds sitting on an estimated \u00a32 trillion in assets, it's hardly surprising the government would like a slice of that. Rubenstein can see a day when pension funds might contribute \u00a375bn. For now, ambitions are more modest. The Pensions Infrastructure Platform is an attempt to unlock \u00a32bn of UK pension funds for infrastructure. Launched in 2012, it announced its first investment last month. But three others, the London Pension Authority, BAE and BT, decided not to join. \"Their criteria changed,\" says Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds. \"It would be unrealistic to go from zero to \u00a32bn in one hit.\" One senior asset manager forecasts that demand for such funds will only grow. \"As the market matures and develops, people's appreciation of risk improves,\" says Arthur Rakowskiof Macquarie's asset management division. Ultimately, whether the investor is a sovereign wealth fund or a UK pension fund, the government will always be a major player. In a review for the Labour party, Sir John Armitt, a former chief executive of Network Rail, concluded that long-term funding can only come from the taxpayer. Behind London's \u00a315bn Crossrail project, the \u00a342bn HS2 line and more modest plans up and down the country stands the muscle of the government's budget and borrowing power. \"The recognition \u2013 anathema to both parties for a long time \u2013 that the government's credibility should be leveraged, has now come forward,\" says Helm. \"The government is back big time.\"",

      "body": "<p>Neither David Cameron nor George Osborne needs much encouragement to appear in a safety suit and a hard hat. In a rare double act in April the prime minister and chancellor visited a building site on the M1 to promise that more than 200 rail, road, broadband and water projects would be heading for completion this year. It was part of a bigger national infrastructure plan, a wish list of almost 650 schemes, from HS2 to better drainage on the M3.</p> <p>The momentum will continue in this week's Queen's speech, which is expected to contain an infrastructure bill attempting to fast-track contentious projects, including fracking.</p> <p>Cameron has compared this to the pioneering railways, sewers and bridges of the Victorian age. Yet spending on roads, tracks, runways and wires has shrunk in recent years. Public spending on infrastructure was worth \u00a322bn or 1.4% of GDP in 2012-13, compared with \u00a352bn or 3.4% in Labour's last year in power. And the private sector has not filled the gap. Private infrastructure orders were worth \u00a39.5bn in 2012, a 6% fall on the previous year.</p> <p>This leaves total infrastructure spending \"massively below the broad requirement\", according to Oxford University economist Dieter Helm, who estimates that the UK should be spending \u00a350bn a year: \"We are now a long way behind on essential infrastructure investment.\"</p> <p>Despite the improving economy, he says, private investors won't step in. \"Is the private sector going to generate that number on spec? No. Do you need to radically step up a gear on how the government engages? Yes.\"</p> <p>Some bits of infrastructure are always less attractive to private investors. Roads offer little prospect of a return: the M6 toll road <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/overpriced-and-underused-m6-toll-road-is-going-nowhere-fast-8606755.html\" title=\"\">is avoided by nine out of 10 lorries on the route</a>. So the government has stepped in. Spending on the Highways Agency, the body responsible for motorways and major roads, is set to more than double, to \u00a33.7bn by 2021.</p> <p>But Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, says the government will have to look again at toll schemes. \"Roads should be a good opportunity for the private sector. Get the model right and the government would find a lot of pension funds and sovereign wealth funds coming in.\"</p> <p>Pension funds leapt at the UK's only high-speed rail line in Kent. In 2010, two Canadian pension funds, Borealis Infrastructure and Ontario Teachers' Pensions Plan, spent \u00a32.1bn on the 30-year concession to run the line.</p> <p>Is this a good deal for the taxpayer? \"Absolutely,\" says Nicola Shaw, chief executive of HS1. She says it has already improved the value of the business, by expanding the retail space at St Pancras, and working with developers at other stations. The attraction for the pension funds is reliable, inflation-linked returns: \"HS1 has also been a very good investment for my shareholders.\"</p> <p>Others are troubled by how easily the government has let go of vital infrastructure. Infrastructure consultant Martin Blaiklock argues that planning is hobbled by the way utilities are owned by distant shareholders and governments. Foreign pension funds or sovereign wealth funds own 91% of Heathrow, 100% of Gatwick, 70% of UK ports and 60% of water companies. Of the UK's big six energy firms, four have no UK directors. \"Government is often unable to direct what is built and by whom,\" says Blaiklock.</p> <p>So why have British pension funds not stepped in? Some say the fragmented structure of the UK industry leaves it lacking vital experience. Others disagree. \"The problem is the availability of the right kind of infrastructure investment,\" says Alan Rubenstein of the Pension Protection Fund, which manages \u00a316bn in assets. \"What you really want is a long-term cashflow-focused approach, not only long-term and linked to inflation.\" The PPF is looking for \"vehicles with long-term cashflows with a real yield of 3-5%, with less risk and less gearing\".</p> <p>With pension funds sitting on an estimated \u00a32 trillion in assets, it's hardly surprising the government would like a slice of that.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The meeting will be held on the day before the 70th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy, but make no mistake: Thursday is D-day for the European Central Bank. That's D as in Draghi, because after all of the ECB governor's silver-tongued manipulation of the market \u2013 all the nudges, winks and hints \u2013 the financial markets now require Mario Draghi to do more than just talk. Expectations are high, probably unrealistically so. After the bloody nose received by mainstream parties in last week's elections to the European parliament, former US treasury secretary Larry Summers had some harsh things to say on US news network CNN about the mess that policymakers had made of things: \"The European common market, European monetary union, was an elitist project that was driven by elites, that led to consequences that were entirely unpredicted by elites, that have been catastrophic for millions of people.\" Draghi can do little to rekindle love for the idea of ever-closer union in Europe \u2013 a project damaged, perhaps beyond repair, by recession, unemployment and austerity. Nor is he in a position to eradicate the structural problems of the euro \u2013 its one-size-fits-all interest rates, its inbuilt deflationary tendencies \u2013 that have been obvious since its creation. These are beyond his remit. The \"elite\" lambasted by Summers has to decide whether to press ahead with closer fiscal integration \u2013 a centralised budget that might make the single currency work better \u2013 in the face of clear voter hostility to greater unity. Instead, the ECB meeting will have a less ambitious, but still crucial, agenda. As Investec economist Philip Shaw puts it, Europe's central bank has four key objectives this week: \"To ease policy to meet its inflation target; to prevent inflation expectations from being dislodged to the downside and increasing the risks of deflation; to stem upward pressure on the euro; and to secure and preferably speed up the recovery, possibly by encouraging credit flow.\" This is not just a question of preventing the eurozone from becoming the new Japan \u2013 where activity is relentlessly weak and both consumers and businesses are deterred from spending by the knowledge that deflation will lead to prices being lower in the future than they are today. The ECB also has to take into account that some parts of the eurozone have suffered from Great Depression-style falls in output since 2008 and that many economies are operating way below pre-recession levels. What's more, the big discrepancies in economic performance across the eurozone \u2013 especially between Germany and France \u2013 will put increasing strains on the central bank. Estimates by the Centre for Economic and Business Research suggest Greek economic output will be more than 23% lower at the end of 2014 than it was in 2008. Italy, Spain and Portugal will have seen declines of 7%, 6% and 6% respectively while even Ireland, the poster child for austerity, will still be operating 4% below its pre-recession level. The eurozone emerged from double-dip recession a year ago, but its recovery has been modest. Exports have been hampered by the slowdown in the global economy and by the strength of the euro. Investment has been constrained by the unwillingness or inability of banks to lend. Unemployment, which averages 12% across the eurozone, has discouraged consumer spending. Latest data suggests that consumer and business confidence is picking up, but even so, growth this year currently looks like coming in at around 1% \u2013 not fast enough to prevent disinflationary pressure from growing. The cost of living across the 18-nation single-currency area rose at an annual rate of 0.7% in April, well below the ECB's target of \"below but close to 2%\". The bank will publish its own forecasts for inflation on Tuesday, but markets anticipate that it will pencil in a figure of only around 1.3% for 2016. That leaves Draghi with plenty of scope for action and he said at last month's ECB meeting that he and his fellow policymakers would feel \"comfortable\" with acting next time. All that is at issue is what form of the attempted policy stimulus will take. There are three possibilities: \u25a0 Cut interest rates First on the list will be lowering rates. Borrowing costs in the eurozone are already close to zero but Draghi will go further. The ECB's refinancing rate \u2013 the rate at which commercial banks can borrow from Frankfurt \u2013 is currently 0.25% and a cut to 0.15% is widely predicted. Of rather greater interest will be what Draghi does to the deposit rate \u2013 the interest banks get when they lodge money with the ECB. The strong speculation is that at this week's meeting it will become the first major central bank in the world to announce a negative rate, probably -0.1%. What that means is that will cost banks money to deposit money at the ECB. The hope is that they will lend the money out instead. \u25a0 Boost lending The second item on the agenda will be whether more targeted steps need to be taken to boost lending, especially in some of the weaker countries on the eurozone's periphery. Draghi has noted that it is much harder for good businesses to get access to credit in Spain than it is in Germany, with figures showing that 25% of viable Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises are constrained by a lack of finance, compared with just 1% in Germany. Here, the ECB is likely to come up with its own version of the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme, which gave banks access to cheaper credit but only on condition that it was lent rather than hoarded. In the past, the ECB has used long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to provide help to eurozone banks: a more targeted LTRO looks likely this week. \u25a0 Start printing money The really big question is whether the ECB is prepared to go the whole hog and announce its own quantitative easing programme, something already tried by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan. Most analysts believe the threat of deflation would need to get more serious before the ECB took this step, although Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics thinks that, to end an economic and financial struggle that is now longer-lasting than the second world war, QE will ultimately be required. \"We still think a bolder programme of asset purchases will be necessary to get the recovery going and avoid prolonged deflation,\" she says. Country by country: how invididual economies are faring Germany Europe's biggest economy began 2014 strongly, fuelling hopes it could drag the eurozone with it. Growth hit a three-year high \u2013 but the recovery appears to be slowing. Business confidence dipped last month after exports fell by the largest amount in 11 months. France The new \"sick man of Europe\" is exhibiting some alarming symptoms as it falls further behind its neighbours. The economy stagnated in the first quarter of 2014, and unemployment hit another record high in April. No surprise that only 3% of the population wants President Hollande to run again in 2017. Italy Almost 10% was wiped off the size of Italy's economy after a 27-month recession that only ended last autumn. Charismatic prime minister Matteo Renzi now promises reforms to make Italy more competitive. But, worryingly, the economy went into reverse again between January and March. Spain The Spanish economy is finally heading in the right direction, after its banking sector was propped up by a \u20ac41bn bailout programme. But its jobless rate remains a stain on the eurozone recovery, with more than one in four adults still out of work. Portugal Lisbon emerged from its bailout programme last month, but faces many more years of cutbacks if Portugal is to hit its deficit targets. The national debt is now a concerning 129% of national output; no wonder economists were alarmed that GDP shrank by 0.7% in the last quarter. Greece The six-year depression is expected to end this year, and Greece made a remarkably successful return to the bond markets in April. But political uncertainty is mounting: with the coalition's majority down to just two, could Athens be forced into an early election? Ireland After three traumatic years, Ireland successfully left its bailout programme last December. But years of cuts lie ahead \u2013 former Taoiseach John Bruton predicts another 10 years of austerity budgets unless growth accelerates. Workers are suffering a wage squeeze, with average earnings falling in May. Cyprus The island is struggling to return to normal after the trauma of last year's bailout, which sent it into a deep recession. There are still strict restrictions on transferring money overseas, and Cypriot ministers have warned the economy would suffer badly if tougher sanctions were imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis. Slovenia Tough austerity and privatisations have helped maintain investors' confidence and shored up its banking sector. But they cost prime minister Alenka Bratusek the leadership of her party. A snap general election is coming in July, raising fears that Slovenia's reform programme could stumble. Austria Austria epitomises the classic northern core of the eurozone, with the lowest jobless rate of any member of the single currency. But its economy may be hitting a sticky patch \u2013 manufacturers report that new orders are stagnating. Finland Conditions have deteriorated since 2012 \u2013 the country has tumbled into recession and economists fear it may not pull out until 2015. With household debt rising and firms regularly issuing profit warnings, Finland is no longer a model to the rest of Europe. Netherlands A housing market crash has left many households deep in negative equity. That's hitting consumer spending, with retail sales slumping by 2.2% in March. Like Finland, the Dutch economy has deteriorated just as the southern periphery has improved. Graeme Wearden",

Once there, you might find might yourself searching for a new T-shirt from inside the changing room if you find the one you took to try on doesn't suit. These are among the 21 technology projects the government has funded to the tune of \u00a32m in the hope they can help high street retailers. The schemes, selected from 181 applicants by the UK's innovation agency, the Technology Strategy Board, under its Reinventing the High Street scheme, aim to help independent retailers and town centres that are struggling to cope with a dramatic shift towards online shopping. Each of the 21 selected will get a chance to do feasibility studies for six months before a handful of the best are selected to share a further \u00a36m of cash for larger-scale trials. Projects include an attempt to build a virtual version of Leeds's Kirkgate Market, where shoppers can buy online and then pick up their purchases later at the ornate building where Marks &amp; Spencer was founded. Another service allows shoppers to view special offers in shop windows via a virtual reality tool. Also among the winners is the Bristol Pound, which is getting a \u00a3100,000 grant to take the digital version of its successful local currency to other towns and cities, starting with Totnes in Devon. David Willetts, the minister for science, admits that high streets face a number of problems, including a lack of car parking and high business rates. But he says: \"For most of the challenges facing the country, innovative technology is part of the answer and I don't see why it should not be part of the answer for the high street. Using mobile phones or other ways of personalising digital technology to help high streets recover is worth a go.\" Richard Miller, head of urban living at the Technology Strategy Board, says technologies that have been proved to help British high streets could also be exported abroad. \"It is not just about the UK: the problems of the high street are pretty much global,\" he says. Reinventing the High Street is the latest effort to revive town centres that are struggling to cope with shoppers' love affair with the internet. Over the past four years, online spending has grown by around 75%, while sales from bricks-and-mortar shops have been flat, according to Verdict Retail. As an increasing amount of shopping is ordered from the comfort of the sofa, local shops are also battling to cope with belt-tightening by consumers hit by rising inflation and low pay rises, while landlords have been unwilling to cut rents and business rates continue to rise. The purpose of the high street is being changed: more services are appearing such as cafes, betting shops and nail bars, while some local authorities are seeking to convert redundant stores into housing, doctors' surgeries or creches. But reports by the TV retail guru Mary Portas and later by former Iceland boss Bill Grimsey both recommended greater use of technology to attract shoppers. Portas said technology that can create links between independent stores and the internet was an important part of creating thriving high streets, but had to be part of an overall package of measures developed by local communities. \"It doesn't matter what digital set-up you have if people can't park or open new businesses because of high business rates. None of this works in isolation.\" High Streets Minister Brandon Lewis said: \"The Government is completely committed to standing up for high streets. We've done this by cutting business rates for local shops, making sensible changes to planning rules and tackling unfair parking practices which drive shoppers out of town.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2014 to add a statement from High Streets Minister Brandon Lewis.",

      "bodyText": "This columnist didn't get where he is today by becoming involved in debates about immigration. My Irish surname speaks for itself. But I have spent most of my career keeping a watchful eye on Europe and, in common with many fellow Europeans, I do not like the way that the European dream is turning into a nightmare. The principal aim of the founding fathers of the European community was to ensure that there should never be another war between Germany and the rest, the most notable member of the rest being France. But a closely associated aim was to ensure general prosperity that, among other things, would not give rise to either the hyperinflation experienced in Germany after the first world war or the mass unemployment which created the conditions that gave rise to Hitler \u2013 who was democratically elected, but after that used undemocratic methods to remain in power. The aim of the two prominent founding fathers, Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman, was to bring Europe closer together politically by economic means. The nightmare would be if the economic means adopted in recent decades served to pull Europe apart. One of the prominent successors, decades later, to Monnet and Schuman was Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing who, as president of France in the second half of the 1970s, was a leading participant in the formation of the European monetary system and the exchange rate mechanism, the precursor to full monetary union and the euro. It was noteworthy that in a recent interview with the Financial Times, Giscard observed: \"It is said people are voting against Europe \u2013 that's not true. They are voting against what Europe is doing wrong.\" For Giscard, it is bad management, not the basic architecture, of the eurozone that is the problem. But if he studied the timely new book by Philippe Legrain, European Spring \u2013 Why Our Economies and Politics are in a Mess, he might be more inclined to accept that the fundamental structure of the eurozone is also to blame. Legrain, a former economic adviser to the president of the European commission, gives a vivid insider's account of just how badly the European political and economic elite responded to the financial crisis. As in the UK, the wrong diagnosis was made when laying so much of the blame on putatively excessive public spending \u2013 an analysis that may have applied to Greece, but not the others \u2013 as opposed to the credit crunch. Fiscal austerity was the wrong response, rendering the crisis much worse. The crisis was aggravated in the eurozone by the loss of such instruments as independence in the determination of monetary and exchange rate policy. But as Legrain forcefully points out, the UK's freedom from such constraints did not prevent policymakers after 2010 from extending the crisis, with those three years of \"flatlining\". Giscard does accept that the eurozone needs \"harmonised economic and fiscal policies\". Alas, all the evidence is that, on their record so far, eurozone policymakers dominated by a pre-Keynesian consensus in Germany would probably be experts in disharmony. It will presumably please David Cameron that Giscard distinguishes between the \"big project\" \u2013 the current and potential new members of the European Union in a predominantly free trade zone, and the \"inner core\" favouring further economic and political integration. There are several ironies here. The French enthusiasm for the eurozone was motivated partly by its wish for a European Germany rather than a German Europe. French policymakers thought they would be less subject to the restrictive economic policies of the Bundesbank if there were to be a European Central Bank. The demotic phrase was that the French wanted their fingers in the Bundesbank till. But it did not work out that way. The strategy of successive British governments has been to try to undermine continental plans for \"deepening\" Europe \u2013 ie, for ever-closer union \u2013 by broadening or widening Europe. The British were among the strongest advocates of the extension of the EU membership to members of the former Soviet bloc, so it is rather unsporting of us to object to the obvious consequences for flows of workers. We now find that the supposedly unstoppable political will of the European elite for ever-closer union may be up against the irresistible force of those tiresome citizens called voters. But I am reminded of a conference I attended in Hamburg in November 2008, where both Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of Germany, and Giscard were panellists. Schmidt was, of course, the other driving force behind the formation of the European monetary system. It was at that conference that Sir Stephen Wall, whose history of our negotiations with the European community I referred to recently in this column, made the remarkable \u2013 at least to me \u2013 revelation that towards the end of his life Monnet was having doubts about the goal of ever-closer union.

      "body": "<p>This columnist didn't get where he is today by becoming involved in debates about immigration. My Irish surname speaks for itself. But I have spent most of my career keeping a watchful eye on Europe and, in common with many fellow Europeans, I do not like the way that the European dream is turning into a nightmare.</p> <p>The principal aim of the founding fathers of the European community was to ensure that there should never be another war between Germany and the rest, the most notable member of the rest being France.</p> <p>But a closely associated aim was to ensure general prosperity that, among other things, would not give rise to either the hyperinflation experienced in Germany after the first world war or the mass unemployment which created the conditions that gave rise to Hitler \u2013 who was democratically elected, but after that used undemocratic methods to remain in power.</p> <p>The aim of the two prominent founding fathers, Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman, was to bring Europe closer together politically by economic means. The nightmare would be if the economic means adopted in recent decades served to pull Europe apart.</p> <p>One of the prominent successors, decades later, to Monnet and Schuman was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/valery-giscard-destaing\" title=\"\">Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing</a> who, as president of France in the second half of the 1970s, was a leading participant in the formation of the European monetary system and the exchange rate mechanism, the precursor to full monetary union and the euro.</p> <p>It was noteworthy that in a recent interview with the <em>Financial Times</em>, Giscard observed: \"It is said people are voting against Europe \u2013 that's not true. They are voting against what Europe is doing wrong.\"</p> <p>For Giscard, it is bad management, not the basic architecture, of the eurozone that is the problem. But if he studied the timely new book by Philippe Legrain, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/European-Spring-Economics-Politics-Right/dp/1782924809/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401446240&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=European+Spring+%E2%80%93+Why+Our+Economies+and+Politics+are+in+a+Mess\" title=\"\"><em>European Spring \u2013 Why Our Economies and Politics are in a Mess</em></a><em>,</em> he might be more inclined to accept that the fundamental structure of the eurozone is also to blame.</p> <p>Legrain, a former economic adviser to the president of the European commission, gives a vivid insider's account of just how badly the European political and economic elite responded to the financial crisis. As in the UK, the wrong diagnosis was made when laying so much of the blame on putatively excessive public spending \u2013 an analysis that may have applied to Greece, but not the others \u2013 as opposed to the credit crunch.</p> <p>Fiscal austerity was the wrong response, rendering the crisis much worse. The crisis was aggravated in the eurozone by the loss of such instruments as independence in the determination of monetary and exchange rate policy. But as Legrain forcefully points out, the UK's freedom from such constraints did not prevent policymakers after 2010 from extending the crisis, with those three years of \"flatlining\".</p> <p>Giscard does accept that the eurozone needs \"harmonised economic and fiscal policies\". Alas, all the evidence is that, on their record so far, eurozone policymakers dominated by a pre-Keynesian consensus in Germany would probably be experts in disharmony.</p> <p>It will presumably please David Cameron that Giscard distinguishes between the \"big project\" \u2013 the current and potential new members of the European Union in a predominantly free trade zone, and the \"inner core\" favouring further economic and political integration.</p> <p>There are several ironies here. The French enthusiasm for the eurozone was motivated partly by its wish for a European Germany rather than a German Europe. French policymakers thought they would be less subject to the restrictive economic policies of the Bundesbank if there were to be a European Central Bank. The demotic phrase was that the French wanted their fingers in the Bundesbank till. But it did not work out that way.</p> <p>The strategy of successive British governments has been to try to undermine continental plans for \"deepening\" Europe \u2013 ie, for ever-closer union \u2013 by broadening or widening Europe. The British were among the strongest advocates of the extension of the EU membership to members of the former Soviet bloc, so it is rather unsporting of us to object to the obvious consequences for flows of workers. We now find that the supposedly unstoppable political will of the European elite for ever-closer union may be up against the irresistible force of those tiresome citizens called voters.</p> <p>But I am reminded of a conference I attended in Hamburg in November 2008, where both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/22/helmut-schmidt-europe-crisis-interview\" title=\"\">Helmut Schmidt</a>, former chancellor of Germany, and Giscard were panellists. Schmidt was, of course, the other driving force behind the formation of the European monetary system.</p> <p>It was at that conference that Sir&#xa0;Stephen Wall, whose history of our negotiations with the European community I referred to recently in this column, made the remarkable \u2013 at least to me \u2013 revelation that towards the end of his life Monnet was having doubts about the goal of ever-closer union.</p> <p>I suspect that President de Gaulle's vision of a Europe of nation states will prevail in the end, but it is important that they co-operate as much as possible within the European Union. There always seemed to be a fundamental flaw in the idea of a United States of Europe. After all, the United States of America was formed by people who had left Europe.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Retail guru Mary Portas has criticised the government for being slow to provide funding and guidance for suffering UK high streets in an essay which takes on her critics by highlighting the successes of towns which have followed her guidance. Two years after the coalition responded to Portas's 2011 review of the high street in which she made a string of recommendations, she writes: \"Progress from central government has been far slower than I'd hoped.\" She also blamed \"bumpy starts\" at the 27 Portas Pilot towns on \"vague supporting processes\" and \"insufficient guidance from government\". The pilot towns have faced criticism over their use of \u00a31.9m in government funding, while some towns have been very slow to spend money at all. Portas says teams are now getting better support but also questions the government's commitment to the \"town centre first\" planning policy, which is supposed to help protect local high streets, pointing out that at the end of last year 31 of the 43 retail developments permitted since new planning laws came into force were out of town. \"Town centre first is a policy convincingly bandied around, but the approval of out-of-town development still happens at a depressing rate, so I question whether local and central government really mean it,\" Portas writes. In the essay, entitled Why Our High Streets Still Matter, which she has posted on her website, Portas is generally upbeat, arguing: \"High streets will thrive if we re-imagine them.\" She says that those who criticise the Portas Pilot towns fail to recognise their progress and that they were just one part of her plan. \"There are now 400 town teams that got no money from the government but are following my recommendations and having great success,\" she says. She points out the success of several towns, including Rotherham, which has been able to draw in more shoppers and reduce the number of empty shops with a mix of training for shopowners, the launch of a local market, pop-up shops and a creative hub for local artists and crafts people. She also highlights the popularity of her suggestion for a national market day \u2013 which has led to the Love Your Local Market campaign and National Markets Fortnight. At this year's event in May, 915 markets signed up. \"Every initiative has come off the back of two years of pushing the government for change,\" says Portas. But she admits: \"Of course we have got a way to go. Have I got it all right? No.\"",
