      "bodyText": "It was at Jackson Hole in 2014 that Mario Draghi prepared the ground for the European Central Bank\u2019s massive bond-buying programme to help rescue the economies of the eurozone, embattled from years of sovereign debt crises. The annual event, held at the Wyoming fishing retreat by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City since 1978, takes place from 24 to 26 August. And it could provide the backdrop for the ECB president to signal the eventual withdrawal from loose monetary policy by the central bank. Pressure is mounting on the world\u2019s central bankers to give more clues about how they intend to exit huge stimulus packages unfurled to dig the global economy out of a hole after the financial crisis. After a decade of low-interest rates and bond buying, a process known as quantitative easing, the Jackson Hole summit could be a platform to convince markets they can safely wean the world off cheap money. \u201cIt\u2019s an important event because we\u2019re at a critical crossroads for many central banks, especially, I would say, for the ECB. The global economy, many economies, still need expansionary policy \u2013 but I don\u2019t think we need this extreme form of monetary policy,\u201d said Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at Swedish bank SEB. The ECB is spending \u20ac2.3tn (\u00a32.1tn) on its QE policy, while the Bank of England injected \u00a3435bn into buying gilts. The Federal Reserve, which is further ahead thanks to a faster recovery in the US, started raising interest rates in December and has bought more than $4.5tn of assets (\u00a33.5tn). Still, normalisation may not be the easiest path for central bankers, with fragile economies, inflation not taking off as expected and the potential for roiling the financial markets with sudden changes. \u201cThe rollback of QE is an experiment that has never been tried before and it is not clear how markets will react,\u201d said economists at fund manager Intermediate Capital Group. \u201cTheir ownership of the market is significant. As markets anticipate Fed balance-sheet reduction and reduced ECB buying in 2018, the risk of market disruptions will increase.\u201d The Fed chair, Janet Yellen, is the first leading figure to speak at the event on Friday, followed by Draghi later that day. The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor for monetary policy, Ben Broadbent, is expected to attend the symposium but is not scheduled to speak publicly. The meeting risks being overshadowed by political events, after posturing from Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un rattled markets this month and the US president became embroiled in a bitter row over his failure to denounce far-right extremismafter the death of a counter-demonstrator at a rally attended by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. Yellen said in June that the Federal Reserve would begin to reduce the size of its balance sheet \u201crelatively soon\u201d, leading to speculation the central bank could start to reduce reinvestments of maturing securities it holds this year. \u201cYellen could say the Fed is going from \u2018relatively soon\u2019 to \u2018soon\u2019. If she wants to implement this in October, she could announce it in September,\u201d said Kathy Bostjancic, head of US macro investor services at Oxford Economics. Draghi may not want to use Jackson Hole to signal the end of the ECB\u2019s bond buying, according to David Meier, an economist at Julius Baer. The governor may instead look to \u201cdownplay as much as possible the effects of monetary policy normalisation in order to keep financial markets calm\u201d, he said. Instead, Draghi could repeat a message he gave in June at the ECB forum in Sintra, near Lisbon, when he expressed confidence in the eurozone economic recovery and reminded investors the ECB\u2019s exit from QE would be contingent on calm conditions on the financial markets, according to Mark Wall, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. While Draghi is not expected to set expectations for the timing of a decision on QE, he could \u201cstill make a throwaway comment\u201d on currency exchange rates that would pique the markets\u2019 interest, Wall said. Although the Jackson Hole is billed as a get-together for central bankers and academics to discuss topics not necessarily of immediate concern, looking instead at emerging issues and trends, the meeting has become a key item watched by global investors and others for signs of their thinking. The Financial Times last week found six central banks \u2013 the Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of Japan, Bank of England and the Swiss and Swedish central banks \u2013 now hold more than $15tn of assets, more than four times the pre-crisis level, following their policy interventions.",

      "bodyText": "Throughout modern history there has been a recurrent fear that jobs will be destroyed by technology. Everybody knows the story of the Luddites, bands of workers who smashed up machinery in the textile industry in the second decade of the 19th century. The Luddites were wrong. There has been wave after wave of technological advance since the first Industrial Revolution, and yet more people are working than ever before. Jobs have certainly been destroyed. Banks, for example, no longer employ clerks to log every transaction in ledgers with quill pens. At this time of year, 150 years ago, the fields would have been full of people with scythes and pitchforks bringing in the harvest. That work is now done by motorised harvesters. The reason new technology has not been the cause of mass unemployment is that new kit will only be used when it makes the productive process more profitable. Higher productivity frees up the resources to buy other goods and services. The rural workers that Thomas Hardy described in Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles found work in factories and offices. What\u2019s more, it was better paid work, and so the upshot was an increase in living standards. Similarly, the age of robots will lead to more jobs. Kallum Pickering, analyst with Berenberg, says there is a big hole in the argument that artificial intelligence (AI) will lead to vast numbers of workers joining the dole queue. \u201cProducers will only automate if doing so is profitable. For profit to occur, producers need a market to sell to in the first place. Keeping this in mind helps to highlight the critical flaw of the argument: if robots replaced all workers, thereby creating mass unemployment, to whom would the producers sell? Because demand is infinite whereas supply is scarce, the displaced workers always have the opportunity to find fresh employment to produce something that satisfies demand elsewhere.\u201d That, though, is not the end of the story. Robots will create more jobs, but what if these jobs are less good and less well paid than the jobs that automation kills off? Perhaps the weak wage growth of recent years is telling us something, namely that technology is hollowing out the middle class and creating a bifurcated economy in which a small number of very rich people employ armies of poor people to cater for their every whim. This is certainly a much more likely threat than mass job destruction. What\u2019s more, it fits with the history of the recent past, the theory of automation, and recent trends in the labour market. Christian Siegel from the University of Kent\u2019s school of economics has found that labour markets in the advanced countries of the west started to polarise as far back as the 1950s as they became more dominated by the service sector. Growth was strong during this period, but the job creation tended to be either at the top end of the pay scale or at the bottom end, while employment opportunities in traditional middle-class sectors of the economy declined. The arrival of IT in the 1980s merely accentuated a process already underway. Robots are likely to result in a further hollowing out of middle-class jobs, and the reason is something known as Moravec\u2019s paradox. This was a discovery by AI experts in the 1980s that robots find the difficult things easy and the easy things difficult. Hans Moravec, one of the researchers, said: \u201cIt is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.\u201d Put another way, if you wanted to beat Magnus Carlsen, the world chess champion, you would choose a computer. If you wanted to clean the chess pieces after the game, you would choose a human being. Dhaval Joshi, economist at BCA research, believes Moravec\u2019s paradox will have a big impact on the labour market. He considers two scenarios for a stylised economy with three jobs: a high-income innovator, a middle-income manufacturer and a low-income animal tender. In scenario one, the innovator comes up with a machine that dispenses with the need for the animal tender. The machine is more productive than the animal tender and so the innovator uses his extra income to buy manufactured goods. That provides the opportunity for the animal tender to retrain as a more highly paid manufacturer. In scenario two, the innovator invents a machine that makes the middle-income manufacturer obsolete. Again, the innovator has more disposable income and uses it to purchase animal tending services. The middle-income manufacturer now has to make a living as a more lowly paid animal tender. In the modern economy, the jobs that are prized tend to be the ones that involve skills such as logic. Those that are less well-rewarded tend to involve mobility and perception. Robots find logic easy but mobility and perception difficult. \u201cIt follows,\u201d says Joshi, \u201cthat the jobs that AI can easily replicate and replace are those that require recently evolved skills like logic and algebra. They tend to be middle-income jobs. Conversely, the jobs that AI cannot easily replicate are those that rely on the deeply evolved skills like mobility and perception. They tend to be lower-income jobs. Hence, the current wave of technological progress is following scenario 2. AI is hollowing out middle-income jobs and creating lots of lower-income jobs.\u201d Recent developments in the labour market suggest this process is already well under way. In both Britain and the US, economists have been trying to explain why it has been possible for jobs to be created without wage inflation picking up. Britain has an unemployment rate of 4.4% but average earnings are rising by just 2.1%. Something similar has happened in the US. The relationship between unemployment and pay \u2013 the Phillips curve \u2013 appears to have broken down. But things become a bit easier to understand if the former analysts and machine operators are now being employed as dog walkers and waiting staff. Employment in total might be going up, but with higher-paid jobs being replaced by lower-paid jobs. Is there any hard evidence for this? Well, Joshi says it is worth looking at the employment data for the US, which tends to be more granular than in Europe. For many years in America, the fastest-growing employment subsector has been food services and drinking places: bar tenders and waiters, in other words. AI is still in its infancy, so the assumption has to be that this process has a lot further to run. Wage inflation is going to remain weak by historic standards, leading to debt-fuelled consumption with all its attendant risks. Interest rates will remain low. Inequality, without a sustained attempt at the redistribution of income, wealth and opportunity, will increase. And so will social tension and political discontent.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne was a worried man. It was May 2016 and the EU referendum was only a month away. The polls were tight, much too tight for comfort as far as the then chancellor was concerned. This had not been for the lack of effort on Osborne\u2019s part. He had published a Treasury paper looking at the long-term implications of Brexit and had orchestrated heavyweight overseas support for the remain side from the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. But with voters seemingly impervious to the barrage of warnings, it was time to put the frighteners on them. The earlier Treasury paper had predicted what the economy might look like in 2030; the one published in May 2016 was about the immediate impact of leaving the EU. It predicted a year-long recession, an increase in unemployment of 500,000, turmoil in the financial markets and falling house prices \u2013 all of which turned out to be well wide of the mark. To put it mildly, this was not the Treasury\u2019s finest hour. In one respect, though, the Treasury was right. The vote to leave the EU resulted in a sharp fall in the value of sterling, which pushed up the cost of imports and reduced consumers\u2019 spending power. The impact of the pound\u2019s depreciation was clearly evident in the batch of official statistics released last week \u2013 most notably in the rise in the annual inflation rate since the referendum and the sluggishness of retail spending. Clearly, the economy has not collapsed since the Brexit vote in the way that Osborne said it would. But nor is it in the best of health. Unemployment is falling rather than rising, but the UK\u2019s productivity performance is woeful. The fall in the value of the pound should help to rebalance the economy by making exports cheaper and imports dearer, but the squeeze on consumers has come through much more quickly than the boost to the trade figures. The retail sales figures would look even more sickly were it not for the spending by overseas tourists, who are finding the UK a cheap place to shop. Following a spurt of (largely) debt-financed spending in the second half of 2016, Britain has fallen back into a low-growth period of around 0.2-0.3% a quarter. Some modest acceleration can be expected in 2018, because by then inflation will have fallen back and real incomes will start rising again. But it will be the wrong sort of growth \u2013 the traditional UK model based on rising consumption rather than rising investment and exports. Quite simply, the UK lacks the productive capacity to take advantage of the boost to competitiveness provided by a falling currency, so when consumption is weak, growth overall is weak too. The reasons for that are familiar enough. An overvalued currency attracted hot money into the City, but disadvantaged manufacturers. Britain\u2019s management has been poor. There has been too little attention paid to skills and training. The further education system is not really fit for purpose. Britain has nothing like Germany\u2019s KfW government-run development bank, which prefers to nurture businesses with patient long-term finance rather than gouging them with high interest rates. Solving these deep structural problems will take time and effort, which UK governments have tended to lack. It has been far easier, sadly, to get a sugar rush by stimulating the housing market. A hollowed-out manufacturing sector and a chronic trade deficit are the inevitable results. Understandably, there is currently a great deal of debate about the sort of trading arrangements Britain will have with the EU and with the rest of the world after Brexit. But in some ways this is putting the cart before the horse. For Britain to have a successful post-Brexit trade strategy it first needs to have a productivity strategy and an industrial strategy. The lessons of Learndirect do not flatter the private sector As it pondered the future of apprenticeship quango Learndirect in 2011, the coalition wanted two things: to raise cash and cut down the number of \u201cNeets\u201d (those not in education, employment or training). It thought it had found the answer: sell the quango. The result has not been a good advert for privatisation. The proceeds were minor, raising \u00a336m from the private equity arm of Lloyds Bank, which at the time was 40% owned by the government. But at first, the company appeared to do well. The number of trainees reached nearly 73,000, and over the years Learndirect\u2019s owners reaped millions in dividends from mostly taxpayer-provided work training young people. There was enough money for the company to spend \u00a3504,000 sponsoring a Formula One team. However, education watchdog Ofsted last week issued a withering report branding its training \u201cinadequate\u201d and pointing out that 70% of Learndirect\u2019s apprentices did not meet the minimum standards. Standards were so low that the Department for Education said it would withdraw all funding from the company. Learndirect knew that Ofsted\u2019s report was going to be damning and was so fearful about the impact that it fought a court battle to prevent its publication. One of Learndirect\u2019s concerns was that the report could have such a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact that it might have to call in administrators. It lost the battle and the report was published; the DfE pulled its contracts. But Learndirect has not gone under and has reassured trainees, staff and investors that it is financially stable. Is this because Learndirect\u2019s parent has set up an ostensibly mirror company \u2013 Learndirect Apprenticeships \u2013 which it tells us is a \u201cseparate legal entity\u201d and therefore not removed from the government\u2019s approved list? Andy Palmer, Learndirect\u2019s chief executive, and Ken Hills, its chairman, did not respond to questions. Neither did Learndirect Apprenticeships\u2019 two directors listed at Companies House \u2013 Andy Palmer and Ken Hills. Ryanair might regret denying passengers a third G&amp;T Michael O\u2019Leary is rarely cast in the role of killjoy. But if he gets his way, passing the hours and minutes in departure lounges will be a considerably drier experience for holidaymakers. Ryanair, the budget carrier of which he is boss, has demanded a two-drink limit at airport bars, on the grounds that airlines have to deal with the consequences of drunk passengers \u2013 such as emergency landings at airports even more far-flung than the average Ryanair destination. O\u2019Leary is now a very powerful executive in European aviation and his words should not be shrugged off by airports. But there could be consequences. If airports cut back on booze sales, they will make less money, and could plug that gap with higher landing charges. This means: higher fares. So there might be fewer drunk passengers for O\u2019Leary to deal with, but also fewer passengers in general.",

    "webTitle": "There are now more than 1,000 tax relief schemes. Give us a break", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Twenty years have passed since former chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown launched his scheme to promote the British film industry, and in doing so innocently spawned numerous lucrative tax relief opportunities for advisers and their investors. The scheme, which allowed investors to claim back 40% of a film company\u2019s losses against their own tax bills, ended up meaning that many investors were able to claim around \u00a340,000 tax relief for every \u00a320,000 they put into a production. Brown clamped down on this \u201cdouble dipping\u201d \u2013 effectively claiming tax relief twice on the same production \u2013 in 2004, after it became clear it was being abused. There are still tax reliefs for the British film industry and they make up just a few of the estimated 1,140 schemes offered by HMRC on everything from plant and machinery to pension saving. Their complexity, and the fact that they favour companies and individuals with the greatest wealth, means that understanding and exploiting the benefits of tax relief is a vast industry. Every government, including David Cameron\u2019s coalition with the Liberal Democrats, has promised to cut back on the number of reliefs and tackle the avoidance and evasion it inevitably promotes, and each has failed. In fact Cameron\u2019s government increased the number of reliefs by almost 100, according to the Office for Tax Simplification, an agency that then-chancellor George Osborne founded in 2010. In 2015, a report by MPs on the public accounts committee (PAC) found that \u201cHMRC does not effectively monitor changes in the cost of tax reliefs, so is slow in identifying instances where a relief is being exploited for a purpose parliament did not intend\u201d. It concluded \u2013 despite vehement denials from the Treasury \u2013 that \u201cHMRC and HM Treasury often show a worrying lack of curiosity about the cost of tax reliefs\u201d. For instance, the costs of research and development tax relief increased from around \u00a3100m in 2001 to more than \u00a31bn in 2011-12, \u201cwhile the actual amount of business expenditure on R&amp;D has stayed more or less the same\u201d, the PAC said. Today the cost of R&amp;D tax relief is \u00a32bn and still corporate expenditure hasn\u2019t budged. It is a safe bet that Philip Hammond\u2019s budget later this year will include tax breaks to support his modest plans to boost investment and encourage long-term planning. In Britain, there is an assumption that tax incentives are a spur to action \u2013 for households or companies alike \u2013 and without them little would change. The argument goes that few people would save for a pension without money off their tax and the British film industry would be left high and dry without the tax breaks that encourage investment. Companies would drop plans to buy the equipment they need without tax relief. Likewise, private landlords would let their flats go unmaintained if the cost were not tax-deductible. In short, the HMRC must forego tax to get everyone from the small-time entrepreneur to the boss of a major corporation out of bed in the morning and off to work. Among corporations, it has become commonplace to lobby local and central governments for cash with the threat of leaving for foreign climes if the money is not forthcoming. Around \u00a3100bn is spent on tax relief, which means that if it were cancelled and everyone just paid the tax that was due on their income and profits, the government would have \u00a3880bn to spend and not the \u00a3780bn it expects to dispense this year. The Treasury argues that in some instances corporate tax relief is only a fraction of the total help on offer. One example is R&amp;D tax credits, which account for \u00a32bn of the \u00a310bn spent supporting research and development. It also points out that tax relief is cheap to administer, and that a complex tax system is a necessary response to a complex economy. But the reason the coalition added 100 tax reliefs to its already massive roster was because they were quick and easy to put in place, not because they were effective. Far better would be to spend some of the money on scrutinising the claims of corporations for help. It would be more transparent \u2013 and their needs might turn out to be like those of a young adult seeking funds from the bank of mum and dad when they are more than capable of looking after themselves. More pernicious is the use of tax relief to support households. Why does the 45p-rate taxpayer get 45p from the government towards their pension saving, when the 20p-rate taxpayer gets just 20p? When upwards of \u00a330bn is lost to the exchequer by encouraging pension saving, it is reasonable to ask why the same amount of government support cannot be given to all. For a government that wants to support families that are \u201cjust about managing\u201d, tax breaks are an irrelevance. Most don\u2019t pay tax, and many don\u2019t even understand how tax is calculated. They need investment in the things that bring well-paid jobs. And nothing the government has done with its growing list of tax reliefs has achieved that.",

Among corporations, it has become commonplace to lobby local and central governments for cash with the threat of leaving for foreign climes if the money is not forthcoming.</p> <p>Around \u00a3100bn is spent on tax relief, which means that if it were cancelled and everyone just paid the tax that was due on their income and profits, the government would have \u00a3880bn to spend and not the \u00a3780bn it expects to dispense this year.</p> <p>The Treasury argues that in some instances corporate tax relief is only a fraction of the total help on offer. One example is R&amp;D tax credits, which account for \u00a32bn of the \u00a310bn spent supporting research and development. It also points out that tax relief is cheap to administer, and that a complex tax system is a necessary response to a complex economy.</p> <p>But the reason the coalition added 100 tax reliefs to its already massive roster was because they were quick and easy to put in place, not because they were effective.</p> <p>Far better would be to spend some of the money on scrutinising the claims of corporations for help. It would be more transparent \u2013 and their needs might turn out to be like those of a young adult seeking funds from the bank of mum and dad when they are more than capable of looking after&#xa0;themselves.</p> <p>More pernicious is the use of tax relief to support households. Why does the 45p-rate taxpayer get 45p from the government towards their pension saving, when the 20p-rate taxpayer gets just 20p? When upwards of \u00a330bn is lost to the exchequer by encouraging pension saving, it is reasonable to ask why the same amount of government support cannot be given to all.</p> <p>For a government that wants to support families that are \u201cjust about managing\u201d, tax breaks are an irrelevance. Most don\u2019t pay tax, and many don\u2019t even understand how tax is calculated. They need investment in the things that bring well-paid jobs. And nothing the government has done with its growing list of tax reliefs has achieved that.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has been a turbulent few years for BHP Billiton, the world\u2019s largest mining and petroleum company. First came the Samarco tragedy in Brazil, when the collapse of a dam at its iron ore mine unleashed a flood and killed 19 people. The company is still facing the prospect of criminal charges and a potential $47bn settlement over the worst environmental disaster in Brazilian history. More recently, BHP came under attack from activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors, which has built up a 5% stake as it bids to force executives to rethink the firm\u2019s strategy. Elliott wants BHP\u2019s bosses to bow to its demands, which include the sale of its US shale oil business. The division was snapped up when oil prices were above $100, but is considerably less attractive now that Brent crude is hovering closer to $50. BHP may be reluctant to seek a buyer at a time when the price is likely to be low, but it is caught between an oil-bearing rock and a hard place. Incoming chairman Ken MacKenzie, due to start in September, was Elliott\u2019s favoured candidate. He will have been hearing Elliott\u2019s views on the matter, as well as those of BHP\u2019s many powerful investors. That makes Monday\u2019s full-year results presentation among the most important in BHP\u2019s recent history. Is Elliott\u2019s 5% stake a large enough lever to move the biggest mining firm in the world? Hold your horses, Jacob Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative politician famed for never having changed a nappy and definitely not wanting to be prime minister, this week tweeted the good news that unemployment had fallen to a 42-year low. This, he suggested, gave the lie to the \u201cBrexit disaster forecast by HM Treasury\u201d. Several pundits and members of the public reminded Rees-Mogg that, as it hasn\u2019t happened yet, the Brexit disaster may be looming rather than immediately upon us. Expect similar arguments to be rehearsed this week when a revised estimate of the UK\u2019s second-quarter GDP figures is released. This will include data not taken into account when calculating the lacklustre 0.3% GDP rise reported last month. Any downward revision will be seized upon by Brexit naysayers as evidence of icebergs ahead. A stable number or upward revision will strengthen the resolve of those seeking evidence that Britain can prosper on its own. Either way, growth figures released while Britain is still in Europe will tell us very little about life outside. Of course, that won\u2019t prevent the numbers being deployed in Brexit arguments from Twitter to the Dog and Duck. Speaking volumes about the jobless It isn\u2019t very often that the typically dry lexicon of the Office for National Statistics overlaps with the definitions included in the Urban Dictionary, the online repository for unsavoury slang, youthspeak and neologisms. This coming Thursday is an exception, because the ONS is due to issue the latest figures on Neets, the acronym for people who are Not in Education, Employment or Training. It\u2019s a term that, according to Google, came into common parlance in around 1999 and has surged in popularity since. It has even spawned a Spanish equivalent, \u201cni-nis\u201d, meaning those who enjoy \u201cni estudia, ni trabajo\u201d, meaning \u201cneither study nor work\u201d. The Urban Dictionary, somewhat unfairly, offers synonyms for Neets including \u201cbums\u201d and \u201clayabouts with no future\u201d. The ONS is likely to be more circumspect than that, given that the number of Neets is certainly no laughing matter. Any swelling in their numbers will be seen as a worrying counterpoint to the UK\u2019s low jobless count. That\u2019s because people who are not working or studying tend to become less employable with time, suggesting that while unemployment is currently low, we may be storing up a joblessness crisis for the future unless something is done to nip the problem in the bud.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "India\u2019s main opposition party has called for a fresh, supreme court-monitored probe into allegations mining giant the Adani Group fraudulently siphoned nearly $235m into overseas tax havens. This week the Guardian published Indian customs intelligence documents alleging Adani Group inflated invoices on an electricity project in India to shift huge sums of money into offshore bank accounts. The Indian conglomerate is hoping to secure a $700m (A$900m) Australian government loan to develop one the world\u2019s largest coal mines in Queensland. The documents, compiled in 2014 by India\u2019s directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI), accuse Adani Group of ordering hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of equipment for an electricity project in Maharashtra state using a front company in Dubai. Read the pdf here. The Dubai company allegedly sold the exact same equipment back to Adani Group-controlled businesses in India at massively inflated prices, in some instances said to be eight times the sale price. According to the allegations in the file, the effect of these transactions was that Adani Group spent an average 400% more for the materials. That money was allegedly paid to a company Indian authorities allege was owned through a series of shell companies leading to a Mauritius trust controlled by Vinod Adani. If true, one effect of the alleged scheme would have been to move vast sums of money from Adani Group\u2019s domestic accounts into offshore bank accounts where it could no longer be taxed or accounted for. Because tariffs for using electricity transmission networks are determined partly by what they cost to build, if the DRI\u2019s accusations are correct, the overvaluation of capital goods would have been likely to have led to higher power prices for Indian consumers. Adani Group and Vinod Adani fully deny the accusations, which they say are awaiting adjudication before an Indian financial crime authority. India\u2019s opposition Congress party on Friday called for an immediate probe into the allegations by the central bureau of investigation, a federal crime-fighting agency, monitored by a judge from the country\u2019s supreme court. It said if the DRI\u2019s allegations were correct, the over-invoicing would have lead to \u201cgrossly inflated prices for the public\u201d. A petition based on reporting by the Guardian and others would be filed with the national power regulator, asking it to investigate every other private electricity company for alleged over-pricing of equipment, the statement added. Congress said it had initiated the investigation into alleged over-invoicing during its last term in government in 2013. It said the Adani Group case had been \u201clanguishing in protracted legal proceedings since the Bharatiya Janata party came to power in the centre and the state\u201d. It accused Narendra Modi\u2019s government of deciding to \u201cgo slow\u201d on the investigation. \u201cAt worst, [it has] sought to wilfully delay the outcome of these investigations as it involves parties perceived in the public eye to be uncomfortably close to its leadership,\u201d the statement said. In a separate case last year, six Adani subsidiaries were listed among 40 other companies being investigated for allegedly running a similar price-inflation scheme. The companies are accused of inflating the price of coal imports from Indonesia to hide profits in overseas tax havens. The DRI and other agencies declined to comment on either investigation. The proposed Queensland mine, which would be Australia\u2019s largest, has been the source of years of controversy, lawsuits and protests over its possible environmental impact. Expanding the coal port to accommodate the mine will require dredging an estimated 1.1m cubic metres of spoil near the Great Barrier Reef marine park. Coal from the mine will also produce annual emissions equivalent to those of Malaysia or Austria according to one study. Adani Group has said in a statement to the Guardian on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and Vinod Adani that it \u201cstrongly denies the allegations of overvaluation\u201d. \u201cIt is a standard procedure for the group to follow international competitive bidding route for major capital expenditures to ensure transparency and competitiveness in the process. All our transactions are always conducted within the framework of extant regulatory guidelines and provisions,\u201d it has said. \u201cThe fact that our projects have incurred the lowest cost across central, state and private utility players has gone to establish the robustness of the processes followed by our group. \u201cIt may be noted that Mr Vinod Adani who is the elder brother of Mr Gautam Adani has been a non-resident Indian for about 30 years and has his own established business interests outside India. \u201cAdani Group is aware of the investigations being conducted by the DRI, and has fully cooperated, and shall continue to cooperate with the investigating agencies.\u201d",
