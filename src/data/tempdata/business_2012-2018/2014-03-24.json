      "bodyText": "The big six energy companies have begun a pre-emptive fightback before a likely competition inquiry into their dominance of the gas and electricity market. Energy UK, the industry trade body, claimed that competition is more intense than it has been for a decade. An independent report commissioned by Energy UK said there are 18 suppliers selling gas and electricity to households \u2013 the highest number since 2005. \"Competition in the energy market is increasing and the pace of change is on the up,\" an Energy UK spokesman said. \"Around a quarter of a million shop around for a new energy deal every month and they now have many more suppliers to choose from.\" However, the report, by consultants Cornwall Energy, indicates that the big six \u2013 Centrica's British Gas, EDF Energy, RWE Npower, SSE, E.ON and Scottish Power \u2013 still supply 94.6% of all household electricity and control 94.9% of the household gas market. \"The other suppliers have a small but notably growing share of the market,\" the report said. Energy UK's claims are made days before Ofgem, the energy market regulator, is expected to recommend a formal inquiry into the big six's stranglehold on energy markets. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, asked the regulator last month to investigate energy companies' prices and profits and \"think radically\" about a possible break-up of the big six. Ofgem's preliminary report, to be published on Thursday, is expected to call on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to conduct a deeper investigation. The consumer group Which? and the Federation of Small Businesses have urged Ofgem, the CMA and the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the \"broken\" energy market. They said nine out of 10 consumers wanted a thorough investigation of the big six. \"It is clear that the energy market is broken and urgently needs fixing,\" Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, and Mike Cherry, national policy chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said. \"For too long the lack of competition in the energy market has not been addressed. It is time for radical changes that deliver an effective, competitive market that works for everyone, before the scale of this crisis worsens.\" The average dual gas and electricity bill is at a record \u00a31,353 a year, up from \u00a3819 in 2009. The rising cost of energy has dominated political debate since Ed Miliband pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins next year's election. Adam Scorer, the director of customer watchdog Consumer Futures, said: \"Small suppliers are taking market share away from the six dominant suppliers, and that's a good thing. But let's not pretend that the problems of the energy market will disappear because big six dominance has reduced from total to just enormous. \"We have called for a Competition Commission referral since around 2007 because the vertically integrated structure of the market prevents [large] scale new entry and does not require vigorous competition to guarantee rewards for the big six. \"If dominant suppliers don't need to compete vigorously with each other and don't need to look over their shoulders at a big new threat to their business, then you will not have effective competition. That's been the case for around a decade. It remains the case now. We need the forensic scrutiny of an independent competition expert to determine whether the market could function more effectively and what remedies would achieve it. The credibility of the energy sector depends on such an independent review taking place.\" Figures released by the Department of Energy and Climate Change show little customer movement between suppliers. SSE, E.ON and RWE npower hold exactly the same market share in gas now as they did over five years ago at 15%, 13% and 12% respectively. British Gas, by far the largest of the big six suppliers, held 44% of the gas market in December 2007 and still held 40% by December 2012, while EDF saw its share rise from 7% to 9%.",

      "bodyText": "Days after George Osborne's bonfire of the pensions regulations, Labour is still on the back foot. Osborne said we should all have the freedom to fritter away our pension funds. Buy a Lamborghini with your retirement pot, I don't care, said the Lib Dem pensions minister, Steve Webb. In an internet age defined more by financial freedom than basic rights such as privacy (let's hear it for GCHQ), Miliband et al find it hard to justify their natural reticence. David Cameron's hint that the inheritance tax threshold could rise from \u00a3325,000 to \u00a31m only twists the knife. The pressure to offer financial freedom comes from a large minority of workers who have missed out on the final salary pension bonanza, but nonetheless have several hundred thousand pounds coming to them on retirement. Low interest rates and long life expectancies have pushed annuity rates down as low as a quarter of the rates available 20 years ago. This is a reasonable complaint. Yet the government has a legitimate interest in their decision. These pension savers fall into two camps. They either compile a fund from their own monthly contributions and tax relief or their fund is the result of their own money, employer contributions and tax relief. In both cases the taxpayer makes a considerable donation to their cause. If pension tax relief costs the exchequer about \u00a342bn, and 40p and 45p taxpayers take \u00a330bn of that, then it is another case of the poor subsidising the better off. People earning about \u00a345,000 may not feel very well off, but they are getting 40p from the government for every \u00a31 they save and that means a considerable proportion of their pension pot is a taxpayer gift. The same argument applies to the demand for a higher inheritance tax threshold. The people who want it live in expensive homes they believe are the result of hard work, when high prices spring from a lack of supply and are being paid for by the next generation. So current taxpayers, most of whom won't have a pension pot when they retire, should be mindful of how private savers spend their money. Australians appear to have blown much of their savings straight away on holidays and home extensions. More miserably, UK savers may be forced to pay off their still-outstanding mortgages. Whichever path they take, there may be little left for a rainy day or more importantly, dementia care, if financial freedom is top of the agenda. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 March 2014. It originally said that inheritance tax could rise from \u00a3325,000 to \u00a31m. The potential rise refers to the threshold at which tax on inheritance starts to be paid, not the tax itself. This has been corrected.",

David Cameron's hint that the inheritance tax threshold could rise from \u00a3325,000 to \u00a31m only twists the knife.</p> <p>The pressure to offer financial freedom comes from a large minority of workers who have missed out on the final salary pension bonanza, but nonetheless have several hundred thousand pounds coming to them on retirement. Low interest rates and long life expectancies have pushed annuity rates down as low as a quarter of the rates available 20 years ago. This is a reasonable complaint.</p> <p>Yet the government has a legitimate interest in their decision. These pension savers fall into two camps. They either compile a fund from their own monthly contributions and tax relief or their fund is the result of their own money, employer contributions and tax relief.</p> <p>In both cases the taxpayer makes a considerable donation to their cause. If pension tax relief costs the exchequer about \u00a342bn, and 40p and 45p taxpayers take \u00a330bn of that, then it is another case of the poor subsidising the better off. People earning about \u00a345,000 may not feel very well off, but they are getting 40p from the government for every \u00a31 they save and that means a considerable proportion of their pension pot is a taxpayer gift.</p> <p>The same argument applies to the demand for a higher inheritance tax threshold. The people who want it live in expensive homes they believe are the result of hard work, when high prices spring from a lack of supply and are being paid for by the next generation.</p> <p>So current taxpayers, most of whom won't have a pension pot when they retire, should be mindful of how private savers spend their money. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/20/budget-annuities-pensions-george-osborne\" title=\"\">Australians</a> appear to have blown much of their savings straight away on holidays and home extensions. More miserably, UK savers may be forced to pay off their still-outstanding mortgages. Whichever path they take, there may be little left for a rainy day or more importantly, dementia care, if financial freedom is top of the agenda.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 March 2014. It originally said that inheritance tax could rise from \u00a3325,000 to \u00a31m. The potential rise refers to the threshold at which tax on inheritance starts to be paid, not the tax itself. This has been corrected.</p>",

This question was debated only semi-seriously when the Co-op Group was diluted to 30% ownership in last year's capital-raising. The pragmatic fudge held that, since the Co-op Group was still the biggest shareholder and since the bank had pledged via a new constitution to behave ethically, the name over the door did not require adjustment. But here we go again. The Co-op Bank, it turns out, requires another \u00a3400m from shareholders to reach a \"responsible and appropriate\" capital position and it is far from clear that the Co-op Group can afford to chip in its \u00a3120m. The Group merely says it will consider its position in due course. Such vagueness, unfortunately, was inevitable at this stage. The Co-op Group has more pressing troubles, like resolving its bitter internal debate over governance and determining how big a writedown is required on its supermarket assets. What if the Group cannot spare \u00a3120m? What if it is diluted down to, say, 20% ownership? On the plus side, it would probably still be the biggest shareholder in the bank. On the other hand, that status could not be guaranteed indefinitely since 20% is not a rock-solid blocking stake. As for the ethical constitution, it's hard to understand why, strictly speaking, it is relevant: surely the term \"co-operative\" is meant to describe a model of ownership, rather than an intended standard of behaviour. According to the Companies Act, \"the Secretary of State can direct a company to change its name if in his opinion its name gives so misleading an indication of its activities as to be likely to cause harm to the public.\" There's plenty of room for subjectivity there. In practice, one suspects, the government would be disinclined to add to the bank's woes since Co-op branding, despite it all, is still seen as an asset. It may be one reason why the retail deposit base has been remarkably stable at \u00a327.8bn. Yet the need for another \u00a3400m is a reminder of how far the Co-op Bank fell short of its high-minded \"ethical\" principles even before it bothered to write them down. The \"conduct and legal documentation\" issues include everything from PPI to interest rate swaps. Pound for pound, the Co-op Bank was as deep in the bad stuff as most of its competitors.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of JP Morgan Chase\u2019s China investment banking arm is leaving, according to an internal memo disclosed on Monday. His departure comes amid a US investigation of the bank\u2019s hiring practices in Asia. Fang Fang, 48, a Chinese citizen who has been with JP Morgan for more than a decade, is a key figure in an ongoing investigation into the bank\u2019s hiring of the sons and daughters of prominent Chinese officials. He had strong ties to the Chinese government and served a five-year term with the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, from 2008 to 2013. The US Justice Department is investigating JP Morgan under the foreign corrupt practices act (FCPA), which bars American companies from giving money or other valuable items to foreign officials in order to win business. The bank did not disclose the reason for his decision to leave. \u201cFang Fang has informed us of his desire to retire,\u201d Therese Esperdy, co-head of Asia-Pacific corporate and investment banking, said in the memo. Fang is expected to leave immediately. Fang\u2019s deputy, Frank Gong, will be promoted to chairman from vice-chairman, according to the memo, which was obtained by Reuters on Monday. Brian Gu and Jing Zhao will become co-heads of investment banking for China. US authorities are examining a programme, originally called \u201csons and daughters\u201d, that was supposed to give the bank key advantages as it built its business in China. The scheme allegedly favoured applicants from prominent Chinese families over other potential hires, which if proved would likely be a violation of the FCPA. JP Morgan's hiring of the son of China Everbright Group chairman Tang Shuangning was among the problematic hires now being investigated by the US authorities, according to the Wall Street Journal. China Everbright is a state-owned financial services group. According to the Journal, JP Morgan has provided US prosecutors with emails from Fang discussing the hire. Last November the bank withdrew from underwriting the initial public offering of China Everbright Bank on the Hong Kong stock exchange. It has also pulled out the IPO of a Chinese chemical company and did not seek a role in the sale of a Chinese state-owned train maker, as a result of the sons and daughters investigation. JP Morgan is not the only bank under investigation over its Asia hiring practices. Other firms under scrutiny include Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and UBS.",

NBNK, which wanted to launch a new bank, lost out to the Co-Operative Bank whose bid imploded last year when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/mar/24/co-op-bank-to-raise-400m-more-capital-live#block-532fe195e4b04c696d9489fb\">its financial crisis</a> began to emerge.</p> <p>Levene told the committee that he was called in by King who told him NBNK's bid would fail because of political pressure for the Co-op to buy the branches. Levene said he had suspected bias in favour of the Co-op and its mutual status and that King's words confirmed his concerns.</p> <p>But in his letter to committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, King said he did not request either of two meetings with Levene and that it was Levene who brought up the subject of political interference.</p> <p>King also supplied accounts of both meetings written by a private secretary who was there. </p> <p>Here's an excerpt from King's letter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although it seemed to me that the government wished to ensure that, if it were possible, a plausible bid from the Co-operative Bank was able to be considered alongside other bids, that was a far cry from any improper behaviour in the bidding process. Had I received evidence of improper behaviour I would have raised that with the regulator, the government and, if necessary, Parliament through the Treasury committee. Given that, I am particularly concerned that the exchange between Andrea Leadsom MP and Lord Levene at the evidence session on 21 January (Q1710) should not be allowed to stand uncorrected.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's the exchange in question:</p> <p><b>Andrea Leadsom:</b> Just a quick question. Lord Levene, is it your opinion that, if he considers a political intervention has been made, it is for the Governor of the Bank of England to stand by and allow that to take place where he is clearly accountable for the integrity of the British financial system? It seems to me utterly astonishing that he would have accepted and advised you to go and talk to the politicians. In his job as Governor of the Bank of England, with the systemic responsibility that he has just received that the best decision needs to be taken with all of the available information as opposed to a political decision, did it strike you as odd at the time? Did you say anything to him about, \u201cSurely it is your job to ensure that it is free and fair\u201d? We live in a free market economy, not in one where politicians decide who is going to own what, other than in extremis, which this was not. Did that strike you as odd? Does it strike you as odd now?</p> <p><b>Lord Levene of Portsoken:</b> Ms Leadsom, you know the then Governor as well as I do. I do not think it would have been very wise for me to go and tell the Governor of the Bank of England how to do his job.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-24T11:09:36.001Z\">at 11.09am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-533002c3e4b06d6b8ecbf3ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-24T10:07:32.609Z\">10.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dixons and Carphone Warehouse have been given an extension to let them continue their merger talks.</p> <p>The companies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/24/dixons-carphone-warehouse-merger-talks\">announced in February</a> that they were in talks about combining to create a \u00a33.5bn electronics retailer.

The agency said: Fitch Ratings has revised the outlooks on four Russian state-related banks, 10 foreign-owned banks and the largest privately-owned bank, Alfa Bank, to negative from stable and affirmed their Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and debt ratings. The ratings of National Clearing Centre, Rosagroleasing, certain subsidiaries of the state-related and foreign banks, and Alfa's parent entity have also been affirmed and their outlooks revised to negative. The rating actions follows the revision of the outlook on Russia's sovereign IDRs to negative from stable. The revision of the outlooks on the long-term IDRs of Vnesheconombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprombank and Rosagroleasing reflects the increased likelihood of deterioration in the government's ability to provide support. Sberbank's and National Clearing Centre's Outlooks have also been revised to negative reflecting both a potential weakening of support and the potential for their viability ratings, which are at the same level as the sovereign, to be downgraded due to risks of a worsening operating environment, as these banks are ultimately exposed to the broader Russian economy. The full Fitch statement is here: Fitch Revises 15 Russian Banks' Outlooks to Negative on Sovereign Change Could there be another wrinkle in the proposed Dixons Retail and Carphone Warehouse merger? As we reported earlier, the two sides have asked for - and been granted - more time to get a deal done. But now comes this: A quick look at the markets, and continuing concerns about the Ukraine, as well as a slowdown in China following a weaker that expected manufacturing survey, have combined to get the week off to a bad start. The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.67%, Germany's Dax is down 1.42%, France's Cac has fallen 1.29%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.36% lower. Russia's Micex, meanwhile, is down 0.72%. News that Russia has put 13 Canadians on a sanctions list in retaliation for earlier moves by Western politicians has only added to the tensions. More on Lord King's letter to the Treasury committee, which you can read here. In it, the former Bank of England governor rejects Lord Levene's claim to the committee that King called Levene into the Bank in 2012 and told him political interference would stop Levene's NBNK investment vehicle from buying more than 600 Lloyds branches. My colleague Jill Treanor's story about King's letter has just been published. The committee's inquiry into \"project verde\" \u2013 Lloyds' attempt to sell the branches \u2013 has exposed plenty of conflicting evidence from City bigwigs. On that note, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. US manufacturing was weaker than expected in March but remained reasonably strong, according to the flash Markit purchasing managers' index. The index came in at 55.5, down from 57.1 in February and below the expected 56.5 but still the second-highest since January 2013. A number above 50 indicates that activity expanded. Markit's chief economist Chris Williamson stressed the positives in the numbers: The manufacturing PMI adds to evidence that the sector has shrugged off the weather-related weakness seen earlier the year, with strong demand encouraging firms to expand and hire new staff at a robust pace. The buoyant growth in March rounds off the best quarter for three years, indicating that the sector should provide a robust contribution to GDP in the first quarter. Growth was not as strong as February, but that\u2019s in many respects only to be expected after last month\u2019s numbers had been boosted by the rebound from January\u2019s severe weather. The fact that the output and new orders indices remained so strong in March is very encouraging news that the sector has come through the weather-related soft patch and continues to play an increasingly important role in the economic upturn. Financial news site Zerohedge isn't so impressed: In the US, activist investor Carl Icahn has succeeded in gettting three more nominees on to the board of Herbalife, the US nutrition company. Icahn is in a war with rival activist Bill Ackman, who has lost a fortune on shorting Herbalife shares. Last January, Icahn called Ackman a \"cry baby\" and a \"major loser\" as their battle over Herbalife intensified. Icahn will now have five nominees on Herbalife's 13-strong board. Here's more from Reuters: Nutrition and weight-loss company Herbalife Ltd said it would allow three more representatives of billionaire investor Carl Icahn to join its board, sending the company's shares up as much as 9 percent before the bell on Monday. As part of an amended agreement with Icahn, Herbalife said Hunter Gary, Jesse Lynn and James Nelson would be put up for election, giving Icahn five seats on the 13-member board. Herbalife, whose business practices are being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, earlier postponed its annual shareholders' meeting to April 29 from April 24 in order to continue talks with Icahn about an increase in board representation. Icahn, Herbalife's biggest shareholder with a 16.8 percent stake, has been supporting the company in its fight against fellow billionaire investor William Ackman. Ackman, who heads Pershing Square Capital Management, has called Herbalife's distribution model a \"pyramid scheme\" and has run up huge losses since taking out a short position of about $1.16 billion on Herbalife's shares. The cost of insuring against Russia defaulting on its debt has soared so that the bonds now have \"junk\" status, Bloomberg reports. Bloomberg points out that while rating agencies think about whether to downgrade Russian bonds the market has already done so. Here are some excerpts from the story: While Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings consider whether Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s military incursion into Ukraine warrants a sovereign downgrade, investors have already cut the nation\u2019s bonds to junk. The cost to insure the government\u2019s debt against non-payment climbed to a 10-month high of 278 basis points in March, topping that of countries rated three steps lower by S&amp;P. Based on the price of credit-default swaps, Costa Rica and Guatemala are among the countries deemed a safer investment, even as the two nations gross-domestic product amounts to about 5 percent that of Russia, the world\u2019s biggest energy exporter... \u201cIt is a warning shot to Russia it could get lots worse if they invade Ukraine,\u201d Marco Ruijer, who helps oversee about $8 billion in emerging-market bonds at ING Investment Management in The Hague, said by e-mail on March 21. \u201cRussia could lose its investment-grade status. Some investors could then be forced sellers,\u201d he said. And here's a tweet with a graph: The Treasury select committee has released a letter sent to its chairman by the former Bank of England governor Lord King. It contradicts evidence to the committee from Lord Levene at a session in January. King wants to set the record straight about meetings he had in 2012 with Levene, who was chairman of NBNK Investments, which tried to buy more than 600 Lloyds bank branches that were up for sale. NBNK, which wanted to launch a new bank, lost out to the Co-Operative Bank whose bid imploded last year when its financial crisis began to emerge. Levene told the committee that he was called in by King who told him NBNK's bid would fail because of political pressure for the Co-op to buy the branches. Levene said he had suspected bias in favour of the Co-op and its mutual status and that King's words confirmed his concerns. But in his letter to committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, King said he did not request either of two meetings with Levene and that it was Levene who brought up the subject of political interference. King also supplied accounts of both meetings written by a private secretary who was there. Here's an excerpt from King's letter: Although it seemed to me that the government wished to ensure that, if it were possible, a plausible bid from the Co-operative Bank was able to be considered alongside other bids, that was a far cry from any improper behaviour in the bidding process. Had I received evidence of improper behaviour I would have raised that with the regulator, the government and, if necessary, Parliament through the Treasury committee. Given that, I am particularly concerned that the exchange between Andrea Leadsom MP and Lord Levene at the evidence session on 21 January (Q1710) should not be allowed to stand uncorrected. And here's the exchange in question: Andrea Leadsom: Just a quick question. Lord Levene, is it your opinion that, if he considers a political intervention has been made, it is for the Governor of the Bank of England to stand by and allow that to take place where he is clearly accountable for the integrity of the British financial system? It seems to me utterly astonishing that he would have accepted and advised you to go and talk to the politicians. In his job as Governor of the Bank of England, with the systemic responsibility that he has just received that the best decision needs to be taken with all of the available information as opposed to a political decision, did it strike you as odd at the time? Did you say anything to him about, \u201cSurely it is your job to ensure that it is free and fair\u201d? We live in a free market economy, not in one where politicians decide who is going to own what, other than in extremis, which this was not. Did that strike you as odd? Does it strike you as odd now? Lord Levene of Portsoken: Ms Leadsom, you know the then Governor as well as I do. I do not think it would have been very wise for me to go and tell the Governor of the Bank of England how to do his job. Dixons and Carphone Warehouse have been given an extension to let them continue their merger talks. The companies announced in February that they were in talks about combining to create a \u00a33.5bn electronics retailer. The Takeover Panel gave them until 5pm today to announce a firm intention to do a deal but the companies now have until 19 May. This is from Carphone Warehouse's stock exchange announcement: Since the announcement of 24 February 2014 was made when discussions were at a very preliminary stage, both parties have agreed that they require more time to evaluate a potential merger of the two businesses. Accordingly, an extension has been granted by the Takeover Panel. The Indian stock market has hit a high, beating last week's previous record, driven partly by foreign investors. This is from Reuters' story: The Nifty rose as much as 1.3 percent to a lifetime high of 6,580.90, while the benchmark Sensex touched a record high of 22,046.58, surpassing their previous milestones hit on March 18. Banks led the gains on optimism about a recovery in the domestic economy tipped to be growing at its lowest pace in a decade, and bets the Reserve Bank of India would keep interest rates on hold for now at its policy review on April 1... Foreign investors have been particularly heavy buyers during the rally, with net purchases of $1.6 billion of shares so far this month, regulatory data showed. \"While the euphoria and the run-up in the equity markets driven by foreign inflows are positive, caution is warranted,\" Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Bank in Singapore wrote in a note on Monday. \"Inflation risks, high borrowing rates, a weak industrial sector and subdued consumption spending are amongst the main economic challenges facing the next government,\" Rao added. Eurozone businesses expanded at a steady pace in March and activity stayed close to February's two-and-a-half year high, a survey showed. Manufacturing and services expanded and France returned to growth, according to the purchasing managers' index (PMI) from Markit. Markit's PMI, which is based on surveys of thousands of companies across the continent, edged down to 53.2 from February's 32-month high of 53.3, roughly in line with forecasts. But firms had to cut prices to keep the momentum going. Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, said. Perhaps the best news this month is the sign of the region's upturn spreading to France. While the PMI is consistent with a mere stabilisation of the French private sector economy in the first quarter, the improvement in the PMI to a two-and-a-half year high in March adds to hope that a fully fledged recovery will be evident in France by the second quarter. \u201cThe rest of the region also enjoyed its best quarter for three years, providing further evidence that the periphery is staging a robust-looking recovery. Policymakers will be encouraged by the survey in terms of the signs of sustained recovery. However, concerns will persist regarding the deflationary forces, especially in the periphery. With prices charged by manufacturers and service providers both falling again in March, there remains an argument for further stimulus, especially if the rate of growth of activity cools again in April. The game appears to be up for Albemarle &amp; Bond, the pawnbroker that bet its future on ever-rising gold prices. The company's shares have been suspended after its banks refused to support the board's revival plan. There is now \"no realistic prospect of any value being attributable to the company's ordinary shares\", Albemarle &amp; Bond said in a stock exchange announcement. It's all a far cry from 2011 when the company's then bosses declared \"the age of the pawnbroker\" as it bought and sold more and more gold, whose price was rising fast. The music stopped last year when the gold price plunged. In short, fears about the world economy and the eurozone receded and investors started selling gold and buying shares. By November last year, Albemarle &amp; Bond had resorted to melting down and selling gold in its shops to stay within its borrowing limits. The Co-operative Bank has announced that it will suffer a loss of \u00a31.2bn to \u00a31.3bn for 2013 and has revealed that it needs an extra \u00a3400m to strengthen its capital buffer. It wants to raise the money from shareholders, who include the Co-operative Group with 30% \u2013 a bill of \u00a3120m. This time the problems aren't from rising bad debts but from \"conduct\" issues such as misselling of payment protection insurance and interest rate swaps. This raises lots of questions and problems, the chief one being that the Co-op Group may not want to take part in the planned rights issue. My colleague Jill Treanor's story explains more. There is more gloomy news from China's manufacturing sector. The factories that power the world's second biggest economy slowed in March, according to preliminary figures from the flash Markit/ HSBC purchasing managers' index. The index fell to 48.1 from a final reading of 48.5 in February and was the worst result since July's 47.7. However, though some of Asian shares' earlier gains were eroded, they stayed up, partly on hopes of Chinese government intervention to stimulate manufacturing. The MSCI index of Asian shares excluding Japan rose 0.9%. Asian shares were also reacting to solid performance from US stocks last week. This comment is from the story we are running: It (the flash PMI) was another bad sign the Chinese economy is softening. It was pretty much expected, so a lot of investors are looking for the Chinese government to roll out some meaningful stimulus on infrastructure or urbanisation themes,\" said Jackson Wong of Tanrich Securities in Hong Kong.",

      "bodyText": "The former Bank of England governor, Lord King, has attempted to distance himself from any suggestions that politicians were involved in promoting the Co-operative Bank's ill-fated bid for 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. Until a year ago, the mutually-owned Co-op was the frontrunner to buy the so-called Verde branches, ahead of a rival offer by bid vehicle NBNK, run by the former Lloyd's of London chairman, Lord Levene. Levene has claimed before the Treasury select committee that he had been told by King \u2013 at meetings in May and July 2012 \u2013 that the NBNK bid would not be accepted because politicians wanted the mutually owned Co-op to succeed. The Co-op pulled out of the bid last year and within two months had revealed a \u00a31.5bn black hole in its accounts. King, who retired as Bank of England governor in June 2013, produced notes taken during the meetings with Levene to demonstrate that he had not suggested politicians were wedded to the Co-op bid. The former governor, though, admitted he was concerned about repeated delays to the sale of the branches, which was demanded by the EU in return for the \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout. In a letter to the chairman of the Treasury select committee, Andrew Tyrie, King said: \"The record [of the May meeting] shows that I said I would raise my concerns about the slow progress of the transaction with the chancellor. \"At the time I was frustrated by the delays to the process because the Verde transaction promised to inject more competition into the banking sector, regardless of who the successful bidder was, and to enable Lloyds Banking Group to move quickly to implement its new strategy.\" After Co-op was chosen as the preferred bidder for the branches, Levene went to see King again. According to the record released by King, Levene had said he was frustrated at Co-op being selected because it reflected government pressure on Lloyds to accept the offer from a mutual. \"Levene said that NBNK's shareholders were questioning why \u00a330m had been spent on what was a wild goose chase. And they would want to know what if anything could be done about it,\" the minute of the meeting said. King had asked Levene if he was considering legal proceedings and was told he knew he needed more than hearsay to prove misconduct during the bidding process. The former governor said that while it \"seemed to me that the government wished to ensure that, if it were possible, a plausible bid from the Co-operative Bank was able to be considered alongside other bids, that was a far cry from any improper conduct in the bidding process\". King said: \"Had I received evidence of improper behaviour I would have raised that with the regulator, the government and, if necessary, parliament through the Treasury committee.\"",

The UK's second-largest pawnbroker asked for its shares to be suspended from London's Aim stockmarket for small-cap firms on Monday, as it warned its share price could remain at rockbottom levels. Albemarle &amp; Bond, which also provides short-term loans, has experienced a sweeping reversal of fortunes since it boasted of \"the age of the pawnbroker\" in 2011 and launched pop-up shops specialising in gold dealing.

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group is facing a demand to pump more cash into its troubled banking arm which has admitted it needs to find an extra \u00a3400m to pay compensation for mis-selling to customers. The 170-year-old debt-laden mutual was confronted with a new request for cash after the bank admitted its losses for 2013 could amount to \u00a31.3bn and that it needed more capital \u2013 on top of \u00a31.5bn poured in last year \u2013 to cover the cost of a string of conduct issues ranging from mis-sold payment protection insurance to mistakes in the paperwork. Mortgage customers who were offered leniency on home loans will also get some redress because they faced charges on missed payments. The scale of the problem disclosed by the bank's new boss, Niall Booker, was larger than had been expected and comes after the rescue of the bank last year, which left the Co-op Group with just a 30% stake. Bondholders, led by US hedge funds, own the remaining 70%. Booker insisted he was confident he could find the cash but admitted he had cut 1,000 jobs, 14% of the workforce, in an effort to shed costs and return a slimmed down bank to profitability in five years' time. Sources believe more jobs are on the line and a stock market flotation of the bank has been delayed to 2015. Booker said the fundraising would take the form of a rights issue \u2013 where existing shareholders are asked if they want to buy new shares first \u2013 which would suggest the Co-op Group would need to put in more than \u00a3100m if it wanted to maintain its shareholding. The last remaining group director on the bank board quit last night to avoid any conflict of interest. The bank played down the significance of the group's stake potentially falling to 20% even though Vince Cable's business department can strip the bank of the right to use the Co-operative name if its use is \"misleading to the public\". Since its rescue last year, the bank has enshrined its commitment to an ethical stance in its constitution in an attempt to prevent such an eventuality. Unusually, the group said it had not yet decided whether to back the emergency cash call after promising to put in \u00a3462m during last year's crisis, which began with the bank pulling out of buying 630 Lloyds branches and which was exacerbated by allegations that its former chairman Paul Flowers had been buying illegal drugs. The group has yet to hand over \u00a3263m of the promised sum and is itself on track to report losses of at least \u00a32bn while it struggles with \u00a31.4bn of debts. \"As a shareholder in the bank, we will consider our position in relation to the proposed additional capital raising and make a further statement as and when appropriate,\" the group said. If the Co-op Group does not want to put in more cash, the bank can offer shares to outside investors, although this would reduce the size of the stake owned by the UK's largest mutual. \"We are in dialogue with them [the group],\" Booker said. The bank had been due to publish its full-year results on Wednesday \u2013 alongside the Co-op Group \u2013 but has now delayed publication until on or before 8 April after giving a preliminary estimate of a \u00a31.3bn loss. Last week the Co-op Group delayed its results until 17 April, following the turmoil caused by the departure of its boss, Euan Sutherland, who branded the organisation ungovernable after his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal was leaked \u2013 including a \u00a31.5m-a-year \"retention payment\". Booker was part of the team appointed by Sutherland last May to run the bank and, when asked if he and his team at the bank were on similar retention packages, he deferred questions to the release of the annual report next month. Booker, who is on track to shut 50 of its 324 branches, said that the deposit base \u2013 money from its savers \u2013 had been very stable despite problems, with \u00a327.9bn of deposits held at the bank compared with \u00a328.1bn in 2012, a fall of less than 1%. While stressing he was not a financial adviser, Booker said customers should retain their money in the Co-operative Bank. Last year's fundraising had made the bank stronger, the bank's values and ethics policies had been written into its constitution for the first time and the customers were still dealing with the same staff, he said. Its crucial measure of financial strength, the core tier one ratio, would have plunged to 7.2%, just above the 7% regulatory minimum, without the latest request for funds. \"We can't live on a sliver of a core tier one ratio,\" said Booker of the need to raise more capital.",
