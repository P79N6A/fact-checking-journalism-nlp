    "webTitle": "EU steel action plan expected to include punitive tariff proposal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An EU action plan to help Europe\u2019s struggling steel industry to be announced on Wednesday is expected to include a proposal to levy punitive tariffs on subsidised Chinese imports, a move the UK government will oppose. Axel Eggert, director general of the European Steel Association (Eurofer), said the situation for Europe\u2019s steel industry was now critical. The UK is one of the hardest-hit countries, he added, with the strong pound and relatively high energy prices raising the cost of British steel. The industry in Europe blames the crisis on state-owned steel companies in China \u2013 and to a lesser extent Russia and Belarus \u2013 that benefit from loans and subsidies that allow them to produce below cost. As a result, EU producers have not benefited from Europe\u2019s rising demand for steel as the car industry and construction sectors rebound out of recession. \u201cYou have an increase in EU steel demand and a drop in prices. This is not normal,\u201d Eggert said. \u201cThis is a very clear sign of massive trade distortions.\u201d The European commission agrees. It estimates that China produces 325m tonnes of excess steel a year, more than double Europe\u2019s annual production. \u201cThe European steel industry is facing a number of serious challenges, fuelled by global overcapacity, a dramatic increase of exports and an unprecedented wave of unfair trading practices,\u201d states the draft action plan seen by the Guardian. The commission says it has passed \u201ca record level of trade defence measures\u201d, pointing to 37 cases in which extra tariffs have been charged on dumped goods. But it says more needs to be done. Last month, ministers from Europe\u2019s biggest steel-producing countries, including the UK, Germany and France, called on the commission to \u201cuse every means available\u201d to help the industry against the \u201cimpending risk of collapse\u201d. Behind this show of unity, the EU countries are divided on how powerful Europe\u2019s trade defences should be. The main point of contention is the lesser-duty rule, an arcane formula for calculating extra tariffs levied on goods produced below market prices. Although not compulsory under World Trade Organisation guidelines, the EU has chosen to abide by the lesser-duty rule, which restricts punitive tariffs on dumped goods. For example, whereas the EU sets a tariff of up to 16% on dumped Chinese cold-rolled steel \u2013 a high-value product used to make car parts, household appliances and furniture \u2013 the US fixed duties at 266%. The commission wants to scrap the lesser-duty rule for countries dumping goods on world markets. Germany and France are in favour, but the UK has been a staunch advocate of this free-trade principle. Eggert contends that Britain\u2019s position sets it apart from other countries. \u201cThe UK often is closer to the US than the EU, but not in trade defence,\u201d he said. He added that the US took a stronger line on enforcing fair trade, compared with Europe. Steelworks have been handing out redundancy notices across Europe, as artificially cheap metal from China depresses prices across the world. Steelworkers at Port Talbot in Wales are to find out this week whether they are among the 750 to lose their jobs, after Tata Steel announced in January that it was cutting more than 1,000 jobs in the UK, which will bring the country\u2019s steel job losses to more than 4,100 since last September. The job cuts at Port Talbot have been mirrored across Europe, with more than 90,000 steel jobs having gone since 2009, a 22% reduction in the industry\u2019s European workforce, according to Eurofer. China\u2019s excess production is also a headache for the country\u2019s ruling Communist party, as the steel glut weighs on domestic prices at a time when the Chinese economy is slowing and demand for steel is falling. In January the government vowed to cut excess steel capacity by 100m-150m tonnes a year, but has not set a deadline. More recently it said it expects to lay off 500,000 workers from the sector. The debate comes as the EU considers the politically sensitive issue of whether to grant market-economy status to China, a change that would make it harder for the EU to levy punitive tariffs. This year, the Chinese ambassador to the EU, Yang Yanyi, told MEPs that China was already a market economy and deserved the status under the terms of its WTO accession in 2000. The commission is scheduled to make a recommendation by the end of the year, but EU member states have the final say. Opponents counter that the EU has no obligation to upgrade China\u2019s trading status at a time when the country continues to dump steel on world markets. \u201cDon\u2019t give market economy status to China until the country fulfils the criteria of a market economy,\u201d said Eggert.",

As a result, EU producers have not benefited from Europe\u2019s rising demand for steel as the car industry and construction sectors rebound out of recession.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cYou have an increase in EU steel demand and a drop in prices. This is not normal,\u201d Eggert said. \u201cThis is a very clear sign of massive trade distortions.\u201d<br></p> <p>The European commission agrees. It estimates that China produces 325m tonnes of excess steel a year, more than double Europe\u2019s annual production. </p> <p>\u201cThe European steel industry is facing a number of serious challenges, fuelled by global overcapacity, a dramatic increase of exports and an unprecedented wave of unfair trading practices,\u201d states the draft action plan seen by the Guardian.<br></p> <p>The commission says it has passed \u201ca record level of trade defence measures\u201d, pointing to 37 cases in which extra tariffs have been charged on dumped goods. But it says more needs to be done.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Last month, ministers from Europe\u2019s biggest steel-producing countries, including the UK, Germany and France,<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/507051/letter-eu-actions-steel-sector-5-feb-2016.pdf\"> called on the commission to \u201cuse every means available\u201d</a> to help the industry against the \u201cimpending risk of collapse\u201d.</p> <p>Behind this show of unity, the EU countries are divided on how powerful Europe\u2019s trade defences should be. The main point of contention is the lesser-duty rule, an arcane formula for calculating extra tariffs levied on goods produced below market prices. </p> <p>Although not compulsory under World Trade Organisation guidelines, the EU has chosen to abide by the lesser-duty rule, which restricts punitive tariffs on dumped goods. For example, whereas the EU sets a tariff of up to 16% on dumped Chinese cold-rolled steel \u2013 a high-value product used to make car parts, household appliances and furniture \u2013 the US fixed duties at 266%.</p> <p>The commission wants to scrap the lesser-duty rule for countries dumping goods on world markets. Germany and France are in favour, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/david-cameron-accused-failing-uk-steel-industry-blocking-eu-lesser-duty-proposal\">the UK has been a staunch advocate of this free-trade principle</a>.<br></p> <p>Eggert contends that Britain\u2019s position sets it apart from other countries.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK often is closer to the US than the EU, but not in trade defence,\u201d he said. He added that the US took a stronger line on enforcing fair trade, compared with Europe. </p> <p>Steelworks have been handing out redundancy notices across Europe, as artificially cheap metal from China depresses prices across the world. Steelworkers at Port Talbot in Wales are to find out this week <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/23/lifes-on-hold-port-talbot-steelworkers-darkening-future-tata\">whether they are among the 750 to lose their jobs</a>, after Tata Steel announced in January that it was cutting more than 1,000 jobs in the UK, which will bring the country\u2019s steel job losses to more than 4,100 since last September.</p> <p>The job cuts at Port Talbot have been mirrored across Europe, with more than 90,000 steel jobs having gone since 2009, a 22% reduction in the industry\u2019s European workforce, according to Eurofer.</p> <p>China\u2019s excess production is also a headache for the country\u2019s ruling Communist party, as the steel glut weighs on domestic prices at a time when the Chinese economy is slowing and demand for steel is falling. In January the government vowed to cut excess steel capacity by 100m-150m tonnes a year, but has not set a deadline. More recently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/29/china-to-cut-jobs-in-coal-and-steel-sectors\">it said it expects to lay off 500,000 workers from the sector</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The debate comes as the EU considers the politically sensitive issue of whether to grant market-economy status to China, a change that would make it harder for the EU to levy punitive tariffs.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This year, the Chinese ambassador to the EU, Yang Yanyi, told MEPs that China was already a market economy and deserved the status under the terms of its WTO accession in 2000. The commission is scheduled to make a recommendation by the end of the year, but EU member states have the final say.</p> <p>Opponents counter that the EU has no obligation to upgrade China\u2019s trading status at a time when the country continues to dump steel on world markets. \u201cDon\u2019t give market economy status to China until the country fulfils the criteria of a market economy,\u201d said Eggert.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

      "bodyText": "In December, David Cameron joined 195 other leaders to promise ambitious action on climate change. Achieving the Paris goals requires leaving most of the world\u2019s fossil fuel reserves in the ground. A first step must be to stop subsidising fossil fuel production. Wednesday\u2019s budget is an acid test of the government\u2019s Paris commitment. In last year\u2019s budget, the chancellor gave \u00a31.3bn in new tax breaks and direct funding to the oil industry. The UK Treasury receives a smaller share of oil revenues than most other comparable countries. Meanwhile, the government has exempted a whole new fossil-fuel industry \u2013 fracking \u2013 from half of its tax, despite huge local opposition wherever it is proposed. The government has slashed support for wind and solar energy, costing thousands of jobs. Yet its free-market rationale does not apply when it comes to the oil and gas industry, which has received continued government support even in times of super-normal profits. The chancellor has to change course. He should scrap subsidies that keep the British economy hooked on fossil fuels, and instead set out a strategy to help communities currently dependent on fossil fuel jobs to diversify and to rebuild around world-leading clean technology. Craig Bennett CEO, Friends of the Earth, England, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland Marc Stears Chief executive, New Economics Foundation Elizabeth Bast Acting executive director, Oil Change International Peter Wooders Programme leader, Global Subsidies Initiative, International Institute for Sustainable Development Mika Minio-Paluello Coordinator, Platform \u2022 In your article on the alarming rise in global temperatures, you quote Professor Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, who said that \u201cwe are in a kind of climate emergency now\u201d (February global temperature \u2018shockingly\u2019 high, say scientists, 15 March). He is, of course, correct, and so we urgently need to implement an effective response. The obvious way to do this would be to cut global greenhouse emissions now, but electorates are still utterly unwilling to accept the radical lifestyle changes we need to achieve this. No western government would dare double petrol prices or remove our ability to repeatedly fly abroad for holidays. No developing-country leaders are going to tell their people they can never have a western lifestyle. The only politically feasible solutions are technological ones, such as carbon scrubbing and geoengineering. Therefore, David Cameron and other world leaders need to start making a massive investment in those areas now, possibly funded by an international financial transactions tax. Otherwise, we do face disaster. Richard Mountford Tonbridge, Kent \u2022 The chief executive of the Road Haulage Association (Budget 2016: Osborne to cut an extra \u00a34bn, 14 March) is guilty of some very selective arithmetic. If an RPI increase in fuel duty represents an increase of \u00a3450 per truck per year, then the 40p drop in fuel prices we have enjoyed over the last few years represents a decrease of \u00a324,000 per truck. I wonder how many hauliers have reduced their prices to reflect this. The low fuel prices are a heaven-sent opportunity for the chancellor to raise some serious revenue. If the RPI 0.75p rise would bring in \u00a3345.5m, then a 20p rise could raise over \u00a39bn with motorists and hauliers still better off than when prices reached their peak. That would save a great deal of pain elsewhere in the economy. Keith Potter Gunnislake, Cornwall \u2022 The proposed CMA reforms in the gas and electricity distribution sector are a grave disappointment (Report, 11 March); its intention to \u201cenable competition to grow further\u201d may be misguided. We don\u2019t need another layer of expensive administration the costs of which will inevitably be passed on to consumers. And it will take too long to implement. Since nationalisation, this industry has lost its moral compass and become more concerned with maximising shareholder profit than providing a minimal cost reliable service. The intention of encouraging consumers to migrate to cheaper deals is admirable, but it is optimistic to believe that this will lead to lower overall costs rather than merely redistributing the same total billing charges over the same customers. Would it not have been simpler, easier and quicker to make each major supplier improve the lot of their own existing customers that have been on a standard variable tariff (SVT) for say more than two years by moving them on to that company\u2019s best fixed one-year tariff? The suppliers could be mandated to make this move within six months and to maintain such customers on a similarly priced fixed tariff for at least four further years. The current practice of migrating customers at the termination of a fixed price period on to a SVT unless the customer makes an effort to stay on a better tariff should be banned. The default should be to move them to another reasonably priced term tariff. Iain Oldcorn Ascot, Berkshire \u2022 It has been said that the Hinkley Point imbroglio has led to a missed opportunity to install the equivalent capacity over the period up to 2024, probably at lower cost as with power actually becoming steadily available over the construction period (Hinkley Point is a costly mistake, but only France can pull the plug, 14 March). As it happens, the current cost per megawatt of providing wind and solar power is about the same as that for building Hinkley Point. But as the sale price for Hinkley Point output is inflation-proofed by the government up to 2092, wind and solar power are certain to continue coming down from today\u2019s prices. It is of course true that wind and solar cannot be relied on for continuous electricity in all weather conditions. But nuclear power has consistently failed to function at the levels of baseload for which it has been designed. And that also requires back-up reserve plants, thus improving the relative performance of the alternative fuels. Wind and solar power consume fuel that is cost-free, and therefore uses 100% of its potential, whereas nuclear and fossil power wastes about a third of its fuel. They also lose a large proportion of the remaining two thirds in transmission costs from generating plants over long distance to connect with the grid. Wind and solar power coming from smaller generating plants can and should be connected to local networks and will therefore be able to reduce losses in transmission. This will also reduce the length, cost and viability of any new pylon lines. Thus, had we committed ourselves to a 10-year programme of non-nuclear electricity, we would have achieved a steady increase in output and eliminated the risk of the lights going out with the stubborn persistence in choosing Hinkley Point. Harvey Cole Winchester, Hampshire \u2022 In his article on Hinkley Point, your journalist writes \u201cbusiness solutions are often described as zero-sum, or win-win\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Tom Hayes, the convicted former City trader, and his wife mortgaged their seven-bedroom country house for \u00a3350,000 to pay legal fees but told the bank the money was for garden improvements, a prosecutor has told the Old Bailey. Michael Parroy QC, representing the Serious Fraud Office, also told the court on Tuesday that Hayes and his lawyer wife, Sarah Tighe, went through \u201cvarious manoeuvres\u201d to transfer the \u00a31.7m Old Rectory in Surrey into her name and failed to inform the SFO as required. Hayes, 36, was convicted of rigging Libor, the benchmark inter-bank rate, last August and is serving 11 years in jail \u2013 reduced from 14 years. He used his contacts at banks and brokers to get the daily rate set in his favour, making him a star trader at UBS and Citi in Tokyo before his activities were discovered. The SFO is now seeking \u00a32.45m in bonuses from Hayes, which it says he was paid because of his Libor rigging. The case is likely to hinge on how much of those bonuses the court deems were because of illegal activity. On the second day of the five-day confiscation of funds hearing, Parroy said Hayes and Tighe applied for a \u00a3325,000 interest-only mortgage on the Old Rectory in April 2013, more than a year after he was arrested in December 2011. On the mortgage application they said the money was for garden refurbishments, but it was clear the real reason was Hayes\u2019s mounting legal fees, Parroy said. On the application, Tighe said Hayes\u2019s share of the house would be transferred into her name. After taking maternity leave she had found a job with the US law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling in London, enabling her to get the mortgage, Parroy said. The mortgage was later increased to \u00a3350,000. When Hayes\u2019s share of the house was transferred to Tighe it was valued at \u00a3250,000, undervaluing his stake by \u00a3600,000, Parroy said. Parroy said emails between Hayes and his former barrister Lydia Jonson showed she warned him not to make changes to the ownership of the Old Rectory without telling the SFO because it would look like he was trying to rid himself of an asset. Parroy said: \u201cAs far as one can see [there is] no information at this stage at all that this process is going on.\u201d Parroy painted a picture of pressure mounting on Hayes and Tighe, who paid \u00a31.2m in cash for the Old Rectory in summer 2011. They had earlier bought a flat in east London for \u00a3940,000 after Hayes lost his job at Citi in September 2010 and returned to the UK from Japan. As with the Old Rectory, they used cash from Hayes\u2019s savings to buy the flat. They added a three-floor extension to the Old Rectory and added a two-car garage, new entrance gates and other features during 2012 before Hayes was indicted in the US in December that year. By early 2013 Hayes\u2019s legal bills in Britain and the US were rising fast and them couple tried to sell the Old Rectory before opting to take out a mortgage, Parroy said. Hayes, who has mild autism, shook his head and made regular comments from the dock during Parroy\u2019s argument. At one point Tighe turned and told him: \u201cStop it.\u201d At his trial last year, Hayes claimed his bosses were aware of his actions and that he had been accused of actions that were widespread in the banking industry.",

      "body": "<p>Tom Hayes, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/03/former-city-trader-tom-hayes-convicted-of-libor-rigging\">convicted former City trader</a>, and his wife mortgaged their seven-bedroom country house for \u00a3350,000 to pay legal fees but told the bank the money was for garden improvements, a prosecutor has told the Old Bailey.</p> <p>Michael Parroy QC, representing the Serious Fraud Office, also told the court on Tuesday that Hayes and his lawyer wife, Sarah Tighe, went through \u201cvarious manoeuvres\u201d to transfer the \u00a31.7m Old Rectory in Surrey into her name and failed to inform the SFO as required.<br></p> <p>Hayes, 36, was convicted of rigging Libor, the benchmark inter-bank rate, last August and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/21/libor-trader-tom-hayes-loses-appeal-but-has-jail-sentence-cut-to-11-years\">is serving 11 years in jail</a> \u2013 reduced from 14 years. He used his contacts at banks and brokers to get the daily rate set in his favour, making him a star trader at UBS and Citi in Tokyo before his activities were discovered.</p> <p>The SFO is now seeking \u00a32.45m in bonuses from Hayes, which it says he was paid because of his Libor rigging. The case is likely to hinge on how much of those bonuses the court deems were because of illegal activity.</p> <p>On the second day of the five-day confiscation of funds hearing, Parroy said Hayes and Tighe applied for a \u00a3325,000 interest-only mortgage on the Old Rectory in April 2013, more than a year after he was arrested in December 2011.</p> <p>On the mortgage application they said the money was for garden refurbishments, but it was clear the real reason was Hayes\u2019s mounting legal fees, Parroy said.</p> <p>On the application, Tighe said Hayes\u2019s share of the house would be transferred into her name. After taking maternity leave she had found a job with the US law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling in London, enabling her to get the mortgage, Parroy said. The mortgage was later increased to \u00a3350,000.</p> <p>When Hayes\u2019s share of the house was transferred to Tighe it was valued at \u00a3250,000, undervaluing his stake by \u00a3600,000, Parroy said.</p> <p>Parroy said emails between Hayes and his former barrister Lydia Jonson showed she warned him not to make changes to the ownership of the Old Rectory without telling the SFO because it would look like he was trying to rid himself of an asset. Parroy said: \u201cAs far as one can see [there is] no information at this stage at all that this process is going on.\u201d</p> <p>Parroy painted a picture of pressure mounting on Hayes and Tighe, who paid \u00a31.2m in cash for the Old Rectory in summer 2011. They had earlier bought a flat in east London for \u00a3940,000 after Hayes lost his job at Citi in September 2010 and returned to the UK from Japan. </p> <p>As with the Old Rectory, they used cash from Hayes\u2019s savings to buy the flat. They added a three-floor extension to the Old Rectory and added a two-car garage, new entrance gates and other features during 2012 before Hayes was indicted in the US in December that year.</p> <p>By early 2013 Hayes\u2019s legal bills in Britain and the US were rising fast and them couple tried to sell the Old Rectory before opting to take out a mortgage, Parroy said.</p> <p>Hayes, who has mild autism, shook his head and made regular comments from the dock during Parroy\u2019s argument. At one point Tighe turned and told him: \u201cStop it.\u201d </p> <p>At his trial last year, Hayes claimed his bosses were aware of his actions and that he had been accused of actions that were widespread in the banking industry.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A continuing fall in the oil price as well as gloomy comments from the Bank of Japan about the economic outlook combined to help sent markets lower. With worries about growth after weak Chinese data over the weekend, mining shares were among the day\u2019s biggest fallers. And in the UK a poll giving a lead to the campaign to leave the European Union also helped unsettle investors. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 34.60 points or 0.56% to 6139.97 Germany\u2019s Dax also dipped 0.56%, to 9933.85 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.75% lower at 4472.63 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 1.14% to 18,765.37 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.69% at 8988.3 In Greece, the Athens market bucked the falling trend, adding 2.31% to 579.30 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually unchanged ahead of the US interest rate decision on Wednesday evening, down just 0.61 points. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow with the UK budget and the US rate news. Earlier, the Serious Fraud Office has ended a long-running investigation into rigging of the \u00a33.5tn-a-day foreign exchange markets without any charges being issued against banks or individuals. Jill Treanor\u2019s story is here: And in the currency markets: Back with oil, and an interesting chart on US production: On the fall in equities today, Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: Markets around the globe lost ground on Tuesday as investors again became consumed by global growth fears. The FTSE was dragged lower by miners as Japan got a week of central bank announcements off to the worst possible start. The Bank of Japan opted to keep monetary stimulus unchanged, instead it said it wanted to study risks to growth for the world\u2019s third-largest economy, refusing to feed to investors insatiable appetitie for monetary stimulus. US retail sales then reignited concerns about economy\u2019s growth prospects, while investors were spooked by a report that China\u2019s central bank is considering a tax on currency transactions to try to curb speculation in the foreign exchange markets. It all contrived to dent investors\u2019 appetite. Crude oil prices are slipping lower for the second day, on fears of a continuing supply glut amid falling demand, as the recent rally runs out of steam The latest economic data from China, the US and elsewhere, as well as a gloomy outlook from the Bank of Japan earlier today, have combined to reinforce the view that the global economy is slowing down. At the same time there is no sign that oil producers have the ability to cut or even freeze production, especially with Iran keep to boost its output now sanctions have been lifted. Even the prospect of a meeting with Opec and Russia to discuss the oversupply situation has done little to support the price. Analyst Phil Flynn at Price Futures Group told Reuters: The rally is now retreating on fears that Opec will continue to flood the market with oil in a world where demand may falter. And investors are also wary ahead of US data due on Wednesday which could show crude inventories at record highs for the fifth week. So Brent crude is down 2.5% at $38.54 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has dropped 2.9% to $36.10. Nordic bank SEB is expecting a summer hike from the Fed. Economist Mattias Bru\u00e9r said: In all likelihood, the Fed will hold rates steady at the March meeting. The current low probability of a hike \u2013 four percent according to future market pricing \u2013 is relevant since the Fed wants to avoid big policy surprises at the current juncture. While the recent easing in financial conditions should have eased the committee\u2019s domestic growth concerns, policymakers probably want to see real GDP growth picking up before hiking rates. The Fed is most likely to be still looking for policy normalisation. While a number of officials may well vote for only two hikes in 2016, the median of the dot plots [the Fed\u2019s indicators of possible rate rises] will likely suggest three hikes in 2016 and four hikes in 2017. Our view is that the Fed likes to see better growth before hiking rates; real GDP growth slowed to just one per cent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter but seems to have picked up to above two per cent in the first quarter. Recession risks have certainly abated in recent weeks as US data has surprised to the high side and financial conditions have improved substantially, thus reversing the tightening seen in January and February. Moreover, the industrial sector is probably at an inflection point too; the most recent ISM manufacturing survey increased substantially and is expected to move back above the 50 level. However, with respect to the policy meeting currently underway, officials may still want to take more time to assess the spill-over effects from financial conditions tightening earlier this year. The global growth outlook is a cause for concern too and as such we do not expect tomorrow\u2019s statement to reintroduce the balance of risk assessment that was taken out of the January statement. By contrast, if the statement says that the balance of risks are \u2018nearly balanced\u2019, it would be a strong indication that the Committee is paving the way for an interest rate hike within the next few meetings. While we suspect that the Fed is currently eying the June 2014-2015 policy meeting, this is just a week ahead of the Brexit referendum. Two big events coming up on Wednesday, the UK budget and the outcome of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting. It is unlikely the Fed will raise rates this time round, with the latest US data in the form of a fall in retail sales. But that does not mean rate hikes will not happen later in the year. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: According to the Federal Funds futures market there is no likelihood of another rate hike to follow on from December\u2019s move. However, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to deliver a hawkish statement and talk up the probability of a rate rise at its June meeting. This may or may not lead to a rally in the US dollar. Given how the yen and euro reacted to recent monetary policy adjustments from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and European Central Bank, nothing can be certain. At the end of January the BOJ took interest rates into negative territory. This was completely unexpected. Yet despite making a move designed to undermine the attraction of the Japanese yen, the BOJ was caught off-guard when the currency rallied sharply following their decision. Last week the ECB took its deposit rate deeper into negative territory... Despite this, together with a trolley-load of stimulus measures, the euro (like the yen) defied expectations and rallied strongly. Investors inferred that the ECB had reached the limits when it came to easing monetary policy. So now we have the Fed. Back in December the FOMC projected an additional 100 basis-points of hikes for 2016. The dollar rallied as investors repositioned themselves for the widening divergence in monetary policy between the Fed and the rest of the developed world central banks. But the greenback fell sharply in early February as market turbulence, the ongoing sell-off in oil and concerns over high yield bonds led to a big risk-off move. Investors became convinced that the FOMC would have to dial back on its plan for tighter monetary policy, or even reverse its December hike. We\u2019ve had a big rally in risk assets since Janet Yellen delivered her testimony in Washington on 11 February. She managed to convince everyone that the US economy was steaming along at a decent clip, but there were sufficient global concerns for the central bank to be restrained when it came to tightening monetary policy. The FOMC will want to keep the upside momentum going, so expect something similar from its statement and summary of economic projections tomorrow. However, it may prove harder to keep things going this time round. The bounce-back in oil and equities looks to be losing momentum. The dollar is the key to where we go next. Conventional wisdom says that the dollar should strengthen as the Fed looks to tighten as other central banks continue with loose monetary policies. But this seems an obvious trade and one which is probably priced in to a large extent. If the dollar were to weaken now then it would take a lot of pressure off oil, other dollar-denominated commodities and emerging markets with dollar-denominated debt. It would also help the sales and earnings of US multinationals. Of course, the markets will do whatever they do. But no one is ready yet for an all-out currency war and January\u2019s G20 meeting could have provided a venue for discussing a coordinated approach to future FX moves. After all, the BOJ Governor appears to have changed his mind on negative interest rates after meeting up with G20 colleagues. Who knows what else was discussed? The slump in Valeant Pharmaceuticals is continuing, as investors react to the news that failing to file its annual report could trigger a default. Brazil\u2019s stock market is being pummelled today by the latest twists in the country\u2019s corruption scandal. Former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was dramatically arrested two weeks ago, has reportedly accepted a position as a government minister. Pleasingly for Lula, that will give him some immunity against prosecution. Last week, prosecutors accused him of money laundering and tax misrepresentation, but a judge has not yet accepted the charges. Lula\u2019s shock detainment in early March sent Brazilian assets soaring, as investors anticipated political change and a more market-friendly government potentially taking control. Live is never that simple in emerging markets, of course. The clouds of worry swirling over US drugs firm Valeant Pharmaceuticals have darkened today. Shares in Valeant have plunged by a third in early trading, after the company slashed its revenue forecast by 16% before the market opened. It has also warned that it could default on its debts if it doesn\u2019t file its annual report soon (it is already delayed). Valeant has already promised to restate some historical financial results, following claims that it has over-inflated its sales figures. Chief executive officer Mike Pearson has just held a \u2018challenging\u2019 conference call, in which he admitted that the company is \u201cnot operating on all cylinders.\u201d This drove shares down to a new three and a half-year low. Pearson\u2019s strategy for Valeant was to focus on drug distribution, rather than the costly business of research and development. But a series of critics have blasted the company for hiking prices. accusing it of \u2018gouging\u2019 profits out of vulnerable patients Its links with mail-order pharma firm Philidor are also under scrutiny, amid allegations that some Valeant staff worked for Philidor using false names. Fortune Magazine has a good timeline of how things unravelled at Valeant in recent months. Jitters over the oil price and persistent growth worries are hitting stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Shares are falling on Wall Street at the start of trading, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down by 98 points or 0.6%. New York traders are disappointed by today\u2019s news that retail sales fell in January and February. The weakening oil price is another concern, with Iran determined to boost its production levels despite oversupply fears. European markets are also in the red. In London the FTSE 100 is down 43 points, or 0.7%. Mining companies continue to be worst hit, after copper producer Antofagasta posted a 34% plunge in profits and scrapped its dividend this morning. And there are heavier losses across Europe, with the French CAC and Italian FTSE MIB both down over 1%. Investors are in gloomier mood after the Bank of Japan downgraded its view of the economy overnight (as covered in the opening post). Some investors are also warning that the recent recovery in share prices simply went too far. Russ Koesterich, BlackRock\u2019s global chief investment strategist, predicts trouble ahead. The equity rebound of the past month is a classic \u201crelief rally,\u201d where investors are relieved conditions are not as bad as they previously feared. This one has been partly predicated on hopes that China is stabilizing, which helps explain the sharp rise in commodity prices given that China is the biggest commodities consumer. Unfortunately, signs of real improvement in China are scant. While the U.S. appears to be stabilizing, the Chinese economy remains challenged. The latest evidence came in the form of a 25% plunge in Chinese exports. This was the largest single-month drop since 2009. The government is likely to try to stem the decline with some palliative measures, but a large stimulus package remains unlikely. Furthermore, the drop in Chinese exports calls into question not just the state of the Chinese economy, but the global trade picture as well. Against this backdrop of continued uncertainty in the global economy, the recent rally is beginning to look a bit excessive. This is particularly evident in the sharp drop in volatility. The VIX Index, a key measure of equity market volatility, has fallen to about half of its February peak. Meanwhile, the VVIX, which measures the volatility of volatility (or, more precisely, how frequently volatility spikes occur), is back to its lowest level since last August. Given the still uneven pace of global growth and tighter financial market conditions, this may too be low. This, in turn, suggests the potential for a rise in volatility \u2014 which would imply another bout of stocks selling off. March may have come in like a lamb, but the lion may be lurking. Back to the main story of the morning, reports that China is considering imposing a financial transaction tax on foreign exchange trading. As explained earlier, the move could potentially deter speculators from targeting the yuan. But Ben Jones, partner and tax expert at law firm Eversheds, has warned that such a levy could backfire on Beijing. It could pose serious problems to Chinese firms, at a time when they\u2019re coping with a slowing economy and market turbulence. Jones writes: \u201cTobin taxes have had a chequered past, with powerful examples of unintended market disruption and genuine concerns about how a Tobin tax can be effectively operated in a global economy. Sweden\u2019s experiment with a Tobin tax in the 1980s ended disastrously, with significant trading activity moving from Sweden to other markets. More recently, the attempts by the EU to introduce an EU-wide Tobin tax have floundered, a key problem being the design of an effective system that discourages migration from the market while avoiding extra-territorial taxation.\u201d Currency trading in China represents a different, more focused target than other Tobin taxes and it may be that such a tax will have the desired effect of dampening yuan speculation. However, history has shown that the knock-on effects of such a tax can be significant and unexpected, and the legal and administrative framework of such taxes are often complex and burdensome. Ultimately, both outcomes are likely to create a more challenging business environment.\u201d Also.... Bloomberg economist Tom Orlik questions whether a levy would deter all speculative attacks. He\u2019s tweeted this chart, showing that the gap between buying and selling the yuan is already wider than for other currencies. A Tobin tax would make that gap wider still. As chairman of relegation-threatened football team Newcastle United, Mike Ashley is no stranger to difficult away fixtures. But the Sports Direct owner now faces another clash - he\u2019s going to be summoned before MPs on the Business committee to answer concerns over how workers are treated. The committee want to quiz Ashley about the Guardian\u2019s recent revelations that staff at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse are searched after each shift - eating into their own time. They will also quiz him about the use of zero-hours contracts, and claims of \u2018gulag\u2019 working conditions. Ashley has proved a tricky man to pin down, but the committee\u2019s patience has now run out - they want to see him on June 7th. Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman has a good story - one of Britain\u2019s largest private equity firms is plotting a \u00a31bn takeover for the Land Registry. The Land Registry holds the official details of who owns Britain\u2019s property and real estate. Chancellor George Osborne is pushing to privatise it, to help tackle the UK\u2019s budget deficit. And Advent International is waiting in the wings, it seems. However, a sale could provoke union anger, as Kleinman explains: The move could attract renewed opposition from trade unions which have warned previously that a sale of the Land Registry could undermine homebuyers\u2019 confidence in its data. Advent, whose investment portfolio includes stakes in companies such as DFS, the furniture retailer, and the FTSE-100 payments group Worldpay, is among a substantial number of private equity groups casting their eye over the Land Registry. Consumer spending across the US dipped last month, suggesting that the country\u2019s economy is a little fragile. Retail spending dropped by 0.1% in February, the Commerce Department says. And January\u2019s data has been revised down to show a 0.4% fall, not the 0.2% rise that was initially recorded. It could mean that the financial turmoil that hit world markets at the start of 2016 may have hit the real economy. And that would mean even less chance of a US interest rate rise being announced tomorrow, or possibly for several months. Back in the markets, oil is seeping deeper below the $40 per barrel mark. Brent crude has shed 2% so far today, to around $38.65 per barrel - its lowest since March 4th, on renewed oversupply fears. Traders are calculating that the recent rally went too far, as predictions that oil producers would agree cutbacks haven\u2019t come true. Instead, Iran is insisting it will raise its output to 4 million barrels per day. Iran\u2019s intransigence could push the oil price lower, as FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga explains: This commodity is heavily bearish and the pain over the unrelenting oversupply in the oil markets has periodically diminished investor attraction while fears over a potential decline in demand continue to sabotage any solid recovery in price. Sainsbury\u2019s executives could be tucking into some Taste The Difference champagne, after announcing their first rise in profits in two years. The results strengthen CEO Mike Coupe\u2019s hand, as he ponders whether to launch a higher takeover bid for Home Retail, owner of the Argos chain. But it\u2019s a gloomy picture at French Connection. Shares have fallen 4%, after it posted another full-year loss following weak demand for its spring and summer clothes last year. That means no dividend for the long-suffering FCUK shareholders. Online supermarket Ocado beat expectations, with a 15.3% jump in sales. But analysts are disappointed that the company still hasn\u2019t landed major partnerships abroad, leaving it struggling to turn a decent profit in the UK. Amazon\u2019s arrival in the UK web grocery market, through a tie-up with Morrison\u2019s, is a looming threat too. Steve Clayton, Head of Equity Research, Hargreaves Lansdown, doesn\u2019t sound very impressed with Ocado: The market wants to see deals. Big deals, with upfront licence fees and lovely, lovely royalties ever after. But so far, Ocado has not been able to get anyone to sign on the dotted. CEO Tim Steiner thinks they will, but, we feel compelled to point out, to go ahead and start a venture such as Ocado in the first place, one has to be a bit of an optimist. Ocado is a technological triumph, hamstrung by the difficulties of persuading customers to pay the full cost of delivering the goods. In theory, shorn of the costs of a store estate, highly efficient customer fulfillment centres (CFCs), churning out hundreds and thousands of orders each and every day, largely without human intervention, ought to make good margins. But the cost of getting the goods to the doorstep always seems to outweigh the starting advantage. Europe\u2019s long-running jobs crisis has eased a little. Employment across the eurozone rose by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2015, new Eurostat figures show, and was 0.1% higher across the wider European Union. That means there are now 151.9 million people employed in the eurozone, but 10.3% of adults are out of work./ Eurostat reports that employment rose in most countries in the last three months of 2015, but not in the UK. They say: Among Member States for which data are available, Malta (+1.7%) and Croatia (+0.8%) recorded the highest increases in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the previous quarter, followed by Spain, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal and Sweden (all +0.7%). Estonia (-2.4%), the United Kingdom (-1.0%) and Lithuania (-0.3%) recorded decreases. A new opinion poll showing that Britain is more likely to vote to leave the European Union has hit the pound. Sterling has shed around 1% this morning, from $1.43 to $1.416 against the US dollar, after the Daily Telegraph reported a narrow lead for the Brexit campaign. Their latest opinion poll showed Leave on 49% of the vote, with Remain holding 47%. But once people\u2019s likelyhood to vote is included, Leave\u2019s lead swells to 52% vs 45%. Here\u2019s the story. The pound first tumbled three weeks ago, when London Mayor Boris Johnson backed the Leave campaigh, but then recovered most of its losses (until today). Women\u2019s leggings, coffee pods, microwave rice and computer game downloads have all been added to the \u2018basket of goods\u2019 used to measure UK inflation, while CD Roms and nightclub fees are out. This is the Office for National Statistics\u2019s annual attempt to better reflect the nation\u2019s spending habits. This year\u2019s changes show the popularity of Nespresso-style drinks machines, and rising demand for rice packs which can be quickly blasted in the microwave. Readers who enjoy a cheeky shot of Bailey\u2019s will be better represented, as cream liquors are now in the basket. And women\u2019s leggings, which the ONS magisterially calls \u201ca type of casual clothing not currently covered but widely purchased\u201d also get in. The ONS has also reacted to the latest changes in technology by adding computer game downloads, and ditching rewritable media (as people increasingly use personal video recorders and download services instead). But the days of shivering in the cold to get into a nightclub are waning, apparently. The ONS has decided to stop counting entry fees, due to \u201ccollection difficulties and reduced expenditure as the number of nightclubs is declining.\u201d Here\u2019s the full list of what\u2019s in, and what\u2019s out. European stock markets are fallen by around 0.6% in early trading, after Japan\u2019s central bank struck a gloomier tone after today\u2019s monetary policy meeting. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 41 points or 0.7% to 6133. Mining shares are doing the damage, with Antofagasta plunging by 9% after it slashed its dividend. It also reported that profits had tumbled by 34% last year, due to the commodity rout. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, reports that investors are more worried about the mining sector and oil prices. The up-trend that had become established off those mid-February lows is looking set to fail and this is knocking confidence in the natural resources sector in general, although the miners are finding themselves under added pressure this morning as Antofagasta becomes the latest in the sector to axe dividend payments. There\u2019s drama in Bangladesh this morning too, where the central bank governor has resigned following one of the biggest cyber thefts ever. Atiur Rahman fell on his sword today, six weeks after online thieves made off with $101m from the central bank. Back in February, they backed into its computer systems of BangladeshBank and transferred the money from its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to casinos in the Philippines. $20m has been recovered, but investigators are still struggling to locate the missing $81m Rahman told Reuters\u2019 bureau in Dhaka that: \u201cI resigned and the prime minister accepted it,\u201d Yesterday, Bangladesh\u2019s finance ministry said it was furious that it hadn\u2019t been immediately informed about the breach and blasted the central bank for being \u201cvery incompetent\u201d. Amazingly, the thieves could have escaped with $1bn, but they blundered by mis-spelling \u2018foundation\u2019 on a web form - triggering a security alert. Rahman, who left school because of financial hardship, is known for fighting poverty in Bangladesh and has won several awards for his work. Experienced City analyst George Magnus believes China would lose any hopes of challenging the supremacy of the US dollar if it imposed a levy on financial transactions. Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University, believes Beijing could be preparing to weaken the yuan again. American macroeconomist James Tobin first pitched the idea of a transaction tax in the 1970s. He suggested a small levy on every financial transaction to \u2018throw sand in the wheels\u2019 of reckless speculation. It\u2019s a popular idea in among critics of the current financial system, who believe it could raise funds to pay for the financial crisis and avoid a repeat. However, a Tobin tax on currency trading would undermine China\u2019s attempts to get the yuan fully accepted in the financial system. Bloomberg\u2019s Michael McDonough explains: China is reportedly planning a new transaction tax on currency trades, in a new attempt to tighten control of its financial system. According to Bloomberg, a levy could be imposed on foreign exchange transactions. It would be pitched as a way of curbing reckless currency speculation. However, it could also effectively act as a capital control, as it would make it more expensive to shift yuan deposits into other currencies. Bloomberg explains that the new tax would be imposed carefully: The initial rate of the so-called Tobin tax may be kept at zero to allow authorities time to refine the rules, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The tax is not designed to disrupt hedging and other foreign-exchange transactions undertaken by companies, they said. Imposing a levy on foreign-exchange trading would be the most extreme step yet by policy makers to prevent speculative bets against the Chinese currency, after state-run banks repeatedly intervened to support the yuan and the government intensified a crackdown on capital outflows. A Tobin tax would complicate plans by China to create an international reserve currency and could undermine the leadership\u2019s pledge to increase the role of market forces in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Here\u2019s the full story: China Drafts Rules for Tobin Tax on Currency Transactions I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Central bankers are in the limelight again today. Overnight, the Bank of Japan has left monetary policy unchanged while it watches the impact of its recent move into negative interest rates. Any hopes (or fears) of fresh fireworks were dashed when the BoJ simply maintained its commitment to raise the monetary base by 80 trillion yen per year, and continued to charge commercial banks 0.1% for reserves left in its vaults. The BoJ also sounded gloomier about economic prospects, which might weigh on markets this morning. Chris Weston of IG explain why: The focus of the session was the Bank of Japan, who ultimately delivered\u2026. very little. It certainly seems that the BoJ have little desire to lower the deposit rate deeper into negative territory. This \u2018no change\u2019 sets the tone for the US Federal Reserve, which begins its own two-day meeting. Inflation, or the lack of it, is dogging policymakers around the globe. And Britain\u2019s statistics office is going to make the whole thing more interesting by shaking up the contents of the basket used to measure price changes. Usually it ditches a few dusty old relics that no-one buys any more, and chucks in a few trendy new items (last year it was \u201ccraft\u201d beers). And on the corporate front, supermarket group J Sainsbury has just announced its first quarterly sales growth in two years (more on that later). The City are also getting results from online supermarket Ocado, engineering firm Balfour Beatty and retailer French Connection. We\u2019ll be covering all the main events through the day....",

Economist Mattias Bru\u00e9r said:</p> <blockquote> <p>In all likelihood, the Fed will hold rates steady at the March meeting. The current low probability of a hike \u2013 four percent according to future market pricing \u2013 is relevant since the Fed wants to avoid big policy surprises at the current juncture. While the recent easing in financial conditions should have eased the committee\u2019s domestic growth concerns, policymakers probably want to see real GDP growth picking up before hiking rates.</p> <p>The Fed is most likely to be still looking for policy normalisation. While a number of officials may well vote for only two hikes in 2016, the median of the dot plots [the Fed\u2019s indicators of possible rate rises] will likely suggest three hikes in 2016 and four hikes in 2017. Our view is that the Fed likes to see better growth before hiking rates; real GDP growth slowed to just one per cent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter but seems to have picked up to above two per cent in the first quarter. Recession risks have certainly abated in recent weeks as US data has surprised to the high side and financial conditions have improved substantially, thus reversing the tightening seen in January and February. Moreover, the industrial sector is probably at an inflection point too; the most recent ISM manufacturing survey increased substantially and is expected to move back above the 50 level. However, with respect to the policy meeting currently underway, officials may still want to take more time to assess the spill-over effects from financial conditions tightening earlier this year.</p> <p>The global growth outlook is a cause for concern too and as such we do not expect tomorrow\u2019s statement to reintroduce the balance of risk assessment that was taken out of the January statement. By contrast, if the statement says that the balance of risks are \u2018nearly balanced\u2019, it would be a strong indication that the Committee is paving the way for an interest rate hike within the next few meetings. While we suspect that the Fed is currently eying the June 2014-2015 policy meeting, this is just a week ahead of the Brexit referendum.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e82e79e4b00ee214c7b2df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-15T15:55:08.737Z\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Two big events coming up on Wednesday, the UK budget and the outcome of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting.</p> <p>It is unlikely the Fed will raise rates this time round, with the latest US data in the form of <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/mar/15/china-tobin-tax-stock-markets-central-bank-business-live?page=with:block-56e803ece4b00eb3a28f7970#block-56e803ece4b00eb3a28f7970\">a fall in retail sales</a></strong>. But that does not mean rate hikes will not happen later in the year. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>According to the Federal Funds futures market there is no likelihood of another rate hike to follow on from December\u2019s move. However, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to deliver a hawkish statement and talk up the probability of a rate rise at its June meeting. This may or may not lead to a rally in the US dollar. Given how the yen and euro reacted to recent monetary policy adjustments from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and European Central Bank, nothing can be certain. At the end of January the BOJ took interest rates into negative territory. This was completely unexpected. Yet despite making a move designed to undermine the attraction of the Japanese yen, the BOJ was caught off-guard when the currency rallied sharply following their decision. </p> <p> Last week the ECB took its deposit rate deeper into negative territory... Despite this, together with a trolley-load of stimulus measures, the euro (like the yen) defied expectations and rallied strongly. Investors inferred that the ECB had reached the limits when it came to easing monetary policy. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17b66286b0b54eb61c28d063c2e509fda4c6dc82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17b66286b0b54eb61c28d063c2e509fda4c6dc82/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Federal Reserve in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Federal Reserve in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>So now we have the Fed. Back in December the FOMC projected an additional 100 basis-points of hikes for 2016. The dollar rallied as investors repositioned themselves for the widening divergence in monetary policy between the Fed and the rest of the developed world central banks. But the greenback fell sharply in early February as market turbulence, the ongoing sell-off in oil and concerns over high yield bonds led to a big risk-off move. Investors became convinced that the FOMC would have to dial back on its plan for tighter monetary policy, or even reverse its December hike.</p> <p>We\u2019ve had a big rally in risk assets since Janet Yellen delivered her testimony in Washington on 11 February. She managed to convince everyone that the US economy was steaming along at a decent clip, but there were sufficient global concerns for the central bank to be restrained when it came to tightening monetary policy. The FOMC will want to keep the upside momentum going, so expect something similar from its statement and summary of economic projections tomorrow.</p> <p>However, it may prove harder to keep things going this time round. The bounce-back in oil and equities looks to be losing momentum. The dollar is the key to where we go next. Conventional wisdom says that the dollar should strengthen as the Fed looks to tighten as other central banks continue with loose monetary policies. But this seems an obvious trade and one which is probably priced in to a large extent. If the dollar were to weaken now then it would take a lot of pressure off oil, other dollar-denominated commodities and emerging markets with dollar-denominated debt. It would also help the sales and earnings of US multinationals. Of course, the markets will do whatever they do. But no one is ready yet for an all-out currency war and January\u2019s G20 meeting could have provided a venue for discussing a coordinated approach to future FX moves. After all, the BOJ Governor appears to have changed his mind on negative interest rates after meeting up with G20 colleagues.

This one has been partly predicated on hopes that China is stabilizing, which helps explain the sharp rise in commodity prices given that China is the biggest commodities consumer.</p> <p> Unfortunately, signs of real improvement in China are scant. While the U.S. appears to be stabilizing, the Chinese economy remains challenged. The latest evidence came in the form of a 25% plunge in Chinese exports. This was the largest single-month drop since 2009. The government is likely to try to stem the decline with some palliative measures, but a large stimulus package remains unlikely. Furthermore, the drop in Chinese exports calls into question not just the state of the Chinese economy, but the global trade picture as well.</p> <p> Against this backdrop of continued uncertainty in the global economy, the recent rally is beginning to look a bit excessive. This is particularly evident in the sharp drop in volatility. The VIX Index, a key measure of equity market volatility, has fallen to about half of its February peak. Meanwhile, the VVIX, which measures the volatility of volatility (or, more precisely, how frequently volatility spikes occur), is back to its lowest level since last August.</p> <p>Given the still uneven pace of global growth and tighter financial market conditions, this may too be low. This, in turn, suggests the potential for a rise in volatility \u2014 which would imply another bout of stocks selling off. March may have come in like a lamb, but the lion may be lurking.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e812e7e4b0536d44c79cb7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-15T13:59:31.374Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tax expert: Tobin tax could backfire</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back to the main story of the morning, reports that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/mar/15/china-tobin-tax-stock-markets-central-bank-business-live?page=with:block-56e7bef7e4b0baf0058c8622#block-56e7bef7e4b0baf0058c8622\">China is considering imposing a financial transaction tax on foreign exchange trading</a>.</strong></p> <p>As explained earlier, the move could potentially deter speculators from targeting the yuan.</p> <p>But<strong> Ben Jones</strong>, partner and tax expert at <a href=\"http://www.eversheds.com/global/en/index.page\">law firm <strong>Eversheds</strong>,</a> has warned that such a levy could backfire on Beijing. It could pose serious problems to Chinese firms, at a time when they\u2019re coping with a slowing economy and market turbulence.</p> <p><strong>Jones</strong> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cTobin taxes have had a chequered past, with powerful examples of unintended market disruption and genuine concerns about how a Tobin tax can be effectively operated in a global economy. Sweden\u2019s experiment with a Tobin tax in the 1980s ended disastrously, with significant trading activity moving from Sweden to other markets. More recently, the attempts by the EU to introduce an EU-wide Tobin tax have floundered, a key problem being the design of an effective system that discourages migration from the market while avoiding extra-territorial taxation.\u201d</p> <p>Currency trading in China represents a different, more focused target than other Tobin taxes and it may be that such a tax will have the desired effect of dampening yuan speculation. However, history has shown that the knock-on effects of such a tax can be significant and unexpected, and the legal and administrative framework of such taxes are often complex and burdensome. Ultimately, both outcomes are likely to create a more challenging business environment.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Also.... <strong>Bloomberg economist Tom Orlik</strong> questions whether a levy would deter all speculative attacks. </p> <p>He\u2019s tweeted this chart, showing that the gap between buying and selling the yuan is already wider than for other currencies.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is cutting 448 investment banking jobs in the UK, moving two-thirds of them to India. The bank, 73% of which is owned by the taxpayer, said it would cut back- and middle-office roles in its investment bank, including a small number of technology jobs. Under its chief executive, Ross McEwan, RBS has been shrinking the division to focus on its personal and small business operations in the UK and Ireland. About 300 jobs will go offshore, to an existing RBS operation based in Gurgaon, near Delhi, and Chennai in southern India. London and Newcastle-under-Lyme will bear the brunt of the cuts, along with Manchester. The layoffs will happen by the end of next year. The move comes just days after RBS announced it would lay off 550 investment advisers, replacing them with an automated system that will offer advice based on customers responses to a series of questions.

In some London boroughs the number of affordable homes has shrivelled to just a handful. Richmond upon Thames, with a population of 194,000, built just five affordable homes in 2014-15 and the City of London managed zero, while Bromley lost affordable homes after the number of affordable properties was cut when a council estate was refurbished. In total, 6,856 properties defined as affordable were built in the capital in 2014-15, down from 6,914 the year before. Affordable housing includes shared-ownership properties and homes sold at below conventional market prices. As a percentage of all housing built in London, affordable housing has fallen to 25%, down from 39% four years ago. Si\u00e2n Berry, Green party candidate for mayor of London, said the statistics published by the GLA \u2013 the authority that includes the mayoralty and the London assembly \u2013 revealed the extent of the failure to tackle the housing crisis.

House prices and rents have loomed large in the London mayoral battle, with property costs cited by many voters as their top concern. The Labour mayoral candidate, Sadiq Khan, has called the mayoral election on 5 May \u201ca referendum on housing,\u201d and promises to accelerate the building of genuinely affordable homes.

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct's Mike Ashley to be ordered to appear before MPs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, is to be formally summonsed to appear before MPs to explain his company\u2019s treatment of its workers. Ashley will be issued with a demand to appear before the business select committee on 7 June after refusing to agree to a number of dates suggested by MPs. A spokesman for the committee said it was reserving the right to take the matter further, \u201cincluding seeking the support of the House of Commons in respect of any complaint of contempt\u201d should the tycoon refuse to attend. A spokesman for Sports Direct said: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed that the committee has apparently chosen to turn down Mike Ashley\u2019s invitation to visit [the company\u2019s head office in] Shirebrook to see things with their own eyes.\u201d He added that the company would respond to the committee \u201cin due course\u201d. The formal demand is the latest development in a spat between Ashley and MPs. Last week, Ashley accused the committee of being \u201cdeliberately antagonistic\u201d and abusing parliamentary procedure by trying to force him to give evidence. In a letter to Iain Wright, the chairman of the business, innovation and skills committee, the Newcastle United boss said he was disgusted by the MPs\u2019 approach. That came after the committee warned him publicly last week that he risked being in contempt of parliament if he failed to appear. Wright wrote to Ashley saying the committee wanted to ask him about his company\u2019s treatment of staff, enforcement of the minimum wage and his internal review of Sports Direct\u2019s practices. The request came after a Guardian report last December into the treatment of workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Debyshire headquarters that found they were subject to surveillance and lengthy searches that meant they effectively earned less than the minimum wage. Ashley offered to meet MPs privately at Shirebrook but Wright declined, citing the \u201cselect committee\u2019s commitment to transparency\u201d. The standoff is the second time Ashley has resisted attempts to make him appear before MPs. He declined an invitation to attend the Scottish affairs select committee last year, explaining he was busy on the dates suggested. Instead, the company sent its chairman, Keith Hellawell, who struggled to answer detailed questions. Ashley\u2019s unwillingness to go to parliament could test MPs\u2019 powers to call in reluctant witnesses. It is highly unusual for business leaders to refuse a request to appear before a select committee. Rupert Murdoch was summonsed by the culture, media and sport committee in 2011 when he refused to give evidence on phone hacking. Murdoch and his son James eventually appeared at the committee after the deputy sergeant-at-arms was sent to deliver formal summonses in person. Also in 2011, the boss of Kraft, Irene Rosenfeld, refused to attend parliament to answer questions about the US food company\u2019s acquisition of Cadbury\u2019s, sending members of her team instead. Committees can seek the support of the House of Commons in providing a summons, putting Ashley at risk of contempt of the house if he refuses, but it is unclear what the potential sanctions could be. A government green paper on parliamentary privilege in 2012 found that, in theory, parliament could summon a person to reprimand, issue a fine or order their imprisonment. But another report that year concluded committees did not have the power to compel witnesses to attend. That report, written by barristers Richard Gordon QC and Amy Street for the Constitution Society, said parliament\u2019s formal powers had not been used for hundreds of years and might not apply in the present day. Any attempt to exercise them could be tested in the courts. Separately, Sports Direct has argued in court this week that a criminal charge against its chief executive, Dave Forsey, linked to the collapse of the group\u2019s USC fashion chain should be thrown out. The presiding judge said on Tuesday that he would rule on whether there was a case to answer next month. Forsey is accused of failing to give authorities, including the business secretary, sufficient notice of plans to lay off staff at a USC warehouse in Scotland. About 200 people were given just 15 minutes notice by USC\u2019s administrator last January that they were losing their jobs.",

      "bodyText": "For many on the Canadian side of the border, it\u2019s starting to feel like the downstairs neighbors are throwing a big party and things have gotten out of hand. The event is starting to get violent; longstanding house rules are suddenly being challenged; and there\u2019s a growing fear that the neighbors are going to come barging in if things don\u2019t go their way. Tonight Canada will learn how likely it really is that Donald Trump \u2013 a man who has railed against trade deals that have been a huge boon to its economy \u2013 will be the Republican nominee for president. While Canada currently enjoys a tightknit economic, political and social bond with its most important ally and trading partner, the recent honeymoon enjoyed by leaders of the two countries could come to a swift end when a new president takes office in January. Last Thursday, standing beside Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Barack Obama referred to America\u2019s northern neighbor as \u201csteadfast allies and the closest of friends\u201d. The budding relationship between the two world leaders was cemented that evening at a state dinner, the first for a Canadian prime minister in 19 years. Surrounded by Canadian royalty \u2013 including Mike Meyers, Ryan Reynolds and Lorne Michaels \u2013 Trudeau and Obama spent the evening discussing their shared vision for border security, trade and the environment. That very same evening Republican presidential candidates, standing on a debate stage in Florida, argued against action on climate change, promoted the need for greater border security and railed against trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the bedrock of US-Canada trade relations. To say that the two economies rely on each other would be an understatement. According to the US Census Bureau, Canada was responsible for 15.3% of foreign trade in January, second only to China (with 16.5%). The US is Canada\u2019s most significant trading partner by a far more significant margin, with 10 times more imports and 20 times more exports in 2014 than its next greatest trading partner, China, according to Statistics Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s by far and away our biggest trading partner,\u201d confirmed Corinne Pohlmann, the senior vice-president of national affairs for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB). Of CFIB\u2019s 109,000 privately owned member companies, a vast majority of which are small businesses, 50% import from and 25% export to the United States. \u201cFrom a small- to medium-sized business perspective, it\u2019s often the first place they dip into the trading pool, given that it speaks the same language, has a similar culture, and it\u2019s a truck drive away rather than a ship or an airplane. It\u2019s absolutely integral.\u201d Being so closely tied to the American economy, explains Pohlmann, comes with both positive and negative attributes. While Canadians often share in America\u2019s growth, reliance on its more volatile neighbour can lead to uncertainty, especially under new leadership. \u201cOne thing business really needs is predictability and certainty going forward: what are the rules of the game?\u201d said Janice MacKinnon, the former minister of finance for the province of Saskatchewan and current professor of public policy at the University of Saskatchewan. \u201cCertainly under Trump there\u2019s much more danger that there\u2019s some dramatic change in the rules of the game than under Clinton, who has been around and has experience and understands that changing the rules has dramatic consequences.\u201d Despite her apprehension towards a Trump presidency, MacKinnon doesn\u2019t think a Republican victory is necessarily bad for Canada\u2019s economy. The Republicans are eager to move forward on the Keystone XL pipeline, which would provide a significant economic boost to the struggling province of Alberta (though Trump is demanding a greater share of the profits). What she does fear however is the protectionist sentiment propagating both parties this election cycle. \u201cIt\u2019s common in the United States, when they get into difficulty and people are struggling and they can\u2019t explain why they\u2019ve lost their jobs and why these manufacturing jobs are leaving, it\u2019s a very common reaction to turn to protectionism,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very protectionist race, and we should be nervous about it.\u201d The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) could prove a casualty of this protectionist mindset. Approval of the agreement, which was championed by President Obama and includes both Canada and the United States, is one of the more significant economic decisions that could fall to the next president. \u201cTPP reflects the fact that the three North American partners and the North American production platform are prepared to move together to explore and carve out new opportunities elsewhere around the world,\u201d said Ed Fast, a Canadian MP and the country\u2019s minister of trade during the TPP negotiations. \u201cWe all saw that as a worthwhile endeavor, and certainly we as Canadians should hope that our American friends do eventually ratify that agreement.\u201d While frontrunners on both sides of the presidential race have campaigned on a promise to abolish TPP and other trade agreements, Fast doesn\u2019t think all would necessarily follow through. \u201cSeven years ago, when Barack Obama was running to be president, he made some claims about Nafta which raised eyebrows on our side of the border, but after all the smoke and the noise from the elections had dissipated, President Obama reaffirmed his support ... and the importance of our three countries having highly integrated economies,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s Obama who is strongly promoting the TPP as a way forward to take our North American partners and allow us to extend that strength into the Asia Pacific region.\u201d When asked more directly about the potential challenges that may arrive in Canada should Trump become the next president of the United States, Fast remained characteristically diplomatic. \u201cAs an individual member of parliament I\u2019m committed to working with whoever the American people elect,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that would be the attitude of our current prime minister and his current government.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Barclays has handed its chief executive, Jes Staley, \u00a31.8m in shares just weeks after his announcement that the dividend to shareholders is to be cut by more than half. The payout to the American, who took the helm in December, was disclosed in a stock exchange filing that showed he and his management team have been handed almost \u00a39m in share bonuses. Stanley\u2019s \u00a31.8m payout includes shares promised to buy him out of bonus schemes from a previous employer, the US bank JP Morgan, which he left in 2013 when he joined a hedge fund. This month, he attacked the bonus culture in banking. \u201cIt is fair to question whether bankers lost their moral compass during the 90s and first decade of this century, because of the single-minded pursuit of personal wealth,\u201d he said, as he announced he was more than halving the dividend in 2016 and 2017. Barclays\u2019 new deputy chairman, Sir Gerry Grimstone, said last week that bonuses should be withheld for a decade. The bank has already published its annual report, which showed it cut its bonus pool by 10% to \u00a31.6bn and paid 323 staff more than \u00a31m. The highest paid director, whose identity is not revealed, received \u00a39.5m. The latest information shows that Ashok Vaswani, head of the retail bank, was handed shares worth \u00a31.7m, Tushar Morzaria, finance director, shares worth \u00a31.1m and Robert le Blanc, head of risk, shares worth \u00a31.3m. All the nine executives at the top of the bank sold enough shares to cover their tax payments but did not sell off any more than required to meet their obligations. Three years ago, Barclays faced fierce criticism when the bonus awards coincided with budget day and it gave \u00a317.6m worth of shares to Rich Ricci, then head of its investment banking division. His retirement was announced a month later. Ricci was at Cheltenham festival watching his horses when Tuesday\u2019s disclosure was made. Last week, bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland handed \u00a317.4m in shares to its top management team \u2013 led by CEO Ross McEwan \u2013 while Lloyds Banking Group issued \u00a320m in shares to its senior executives. The Barclays disclosure covers not just share awards for future bonuses through long-term incentive plans. It also includes details on other payments in shares, including annual bonuses for 2015 and role-based pay awards, which are handed out to stop their pay from falling as a result of the EU\u2019s cap on bonuses. The bank\u2019s payments are down on previous years although comparisons are difficult, as the share price has fallen and some of the higher paid investment bankers are no longer part of the management team. A year ago, when the bank was run by Antony Jenkins, the share handout for the 11-strong executive team was valued at more than \u00a316m.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a busy week for the US labor secretary, Thomas Perez. On Tuesday, hours before the first of his three testimonies to the US Congress, the Labor Department finally submitted the long-awaited overtime rule to the White House for final approval. Overtime pay is the unicorn of US workers\u2019 benefits, with just 11% of salaried workers and 18% of all workers being eligible for overtime in 2013. This is mostly due to the fact that most US workers earn more than the salary threshold that determines which US workers are eligible for overtime pay. Currently, only hourly paid workers and those earning $23,660 a year or less in salary are guaranteed overtime pay \u2013 one and a half times their regular pay \u2013 for any hours beyond a standard 40-hour workweek. The Obama administration is hoping to expand the pool of eligible workers by raising the salary threshold, which was last updated in 2004. That update raised the threshold to $455 a week, but overall did little to increase overtime pay in the US. The terms of the final rule submitted to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget for review will not be disclosed until it is released to the public. When the proposed rule was announced in 2015, it called for a threshold of $970 a week \u2013 or $50,440 a year \u2013 that would expand the pool of eligible workers by more than five million people. The new overtime rule has been a long time coming. Two years ago, in March 2014, Barack Obama first instructed the US Labor Department to devise the new rules that would allow workers other than deli managers, cooks and other low-wage workers to earn overtime pay. According to him, the salary threshold exception was originally established for \u201chigh-paid, white-collar employees\u201d but has since been applied to many other categories of workers as well. \u201cIf your salary is even a dollar above the current threshold, you may not be guaranteed overtime. It doesn\u2019t matter if what you do is mostly physical work like stocking shelves; it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re working 50 or 60 or 70 hours a week \u2013 your employer doesn\u2019t have to pay you a single extra dime,\u201d Obama said at the time. In addition to receiving a salary, overtime-exempt workers must pass a \u201cduties test\u201d that proves they are a supervisor. Supervisors are typically in charge of two or more full-time employees during a fraction of their work week. Even as the US unemployment rate dropped below 5%, the Labor Department has maintained that wages continue to be the unfinished business of this recovery. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why the president believes the minimum wage needs to be increased. It\u2019s one of the reasons why the Department of Labor is reforming our overtime rule,\u201d Chris Lu, the deputy labor secretary, told the Guardian last year. \u201cThe overtime rule would absolutely help wages and provide benefit of potentially higher wages to upwards of five million people in this country.\u201d The final overtime rule is bound to come up this week as Perez faces off with the House and Senate appropriations committees on budget on Tuesday and Thursday and testifies before the House education and workforce committee about the department\u2019s \u201cpolicies and priorities\u201d on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "Online grocer Ocado has insisted it is growing in confidence, as it revealed a double-digit increase in sales but yet again failed to provide news on a much-awaited overseas partnership. Its shares rose 3% after it reported that group sales had increased 15.3% to \u00a3312.4m in the 12 weeks to 21 February and that the average number of orders a week had risen to 214,000. However, the average size of shoppers\u2019 order slipped by 2.9%, Ocado added. Tim Steiner, its chief executive, said the company had recently shipped 250,000 orders in a single week for the first time. \u201cWe are pleased with the steady progress in our business, maintaining double-digit sales growth in a retail environment that remains challenging,\u201d he added. Ocado\u2019s pace of growth far outstrips that of traditional grocers, most of which have seen sales fall as shoppers switch to buying online or in small local stores. The big supermarket chains have also been forced to cut prices in the face of rising competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. City analysts are concerned that Ocado has yet to find a partner which wants to use its technology outside the UK \u2013 a key part of the business\u2019s strategy. A deal with supermarket Morrisons in October 2013 transformed the view of Ocado, sending its share price soaring. Ocado had promised it would sign an international partner by the end of last year. Duncan Tatton-Brown, its finance director, said the company was still on track to sign \u201cmultiple partners in the medium term. This is not a race. It isn\u2019t that if we don\u2019t sign in the first couple of months of this year we have failed. This is a long term game and we are building our capabilities and talking to partners around the world.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have more not less confidence and Morrisons is an example of that.\u201d Ocado is in talks with Morrisons about expanding their agreement to deliver online groceries from the former\u2019s new distribution centre in Erith, south-east London. Morrisons also wants to expand into parts of the UK not covered by Ocado\u2019s network by picking goods from its own stores. Tatton-Brown said those talks did not indicate a problem with the Ocado model. \u201cWe never envisaged that in the short term we would be able to deliver a centrally picked order to customers north of Aberdeen. We always envisaged a different solution to that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think our model is suited to the extremities of the UK.\u201d Tatton-Brown also sought to put a positive spin on Morrisons\u2019 recent deal to provide food to online retailer Amazon. He said: \u201cWe are encouraged that more and more players want to be in that space. This is about moving UK consumers to shift more of their spend online.\u201d Ray Gaul of analysis firm Kantar Retail, said that deal was \u201ccasting doubt on the long-term growth prospects and profitability of the Morrisons partnership\u201d. In December, Ocado\u2019s share price slid back after Amazon said it would rapidly expand its grocery delivery service in the UK and that the British business faced competition in signing up international partners. The Morrisons deal with Amazon has only compounded those worries. \u201cInvestors are losing patience with [Ocado chairman] Lord Rose and Tim Steiner\u2019s promises to diversify into international markets and sign retailers up to the Ocado smartplatform business-to-business software solution,\u201d Gaul said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has revealed its first quarterly sales growth in more than two years, raising hopes that the supermarket will make a new bid for Argos owner Home Retail Group this week. Sales at established stores, including online, rose 0.1% in the nine weeks to 12 March. Total sales were lifted by a 14% rise in online grocery sales, 10% rise in sales of clothing and 11% lift in sales of entertainment products, such as CDs and DVDs, buoyed by the release of Adele\u2019s latest album and the Bond film Spectre. Ideas that cater to new food trends, such as ready made \u201ccourgetti\u201d \u2013 spaghetti made from courgettes \u2013 and \u201cboodles\u201d \u2013 noodles made from butternut squash \u2013 also helped attract new shoppers. Food price deflation slowed at Sainsbury\u2019s to between 1% and 1.5% from 1.5% and 2% over the previous six months as the retailer annualised price cuts made last year. The company said underlying sales at its large supermarkets were flat to slightly down, with the vast majority of growth coming from online. The performance was a step up from the 0.4% fall in sales Sainsbury\u2019s delivered in the 15 weeks to 9 January, and above analysts\u2019 forecasts. The City had expected Sainsbury\u2019s to reveal further sales declines but its upturn came after Morrisons revealed its first quarterly sales growth in four years last week. Mike Coupe, chief executive, said Sainsbury\u2019s had delivered a strong performance over the quarter as it increased both the number of till-based transactions and the average number of items shoppers put in their baskets. He said better service and availability as well as a move away from promotions to regularly available lower prices had helped drive sales. \u201cWe have traded well this year and are making excellent progress implementing our strategy. The market will remain competitive but we are confident that we will continue to outperform our major peers,\u201d Coupe added. With a reference to a comment from Asda\u2019s boss, Andy Clarke, who saw sales fall further after suggesting performance had bottomed out, Coupe said he was not going to suggest Sainsbury\u2019s had passed a nadir. \u201cIt\u2019s very premature to call the turn,\u201d he added. Coupe said he expected prices to continue to fall for at least six months, adding that Sainsbury\u2019s was ready to go \u201ctoe-to-toe\u201d with competitors and had the financial firepower to do so. \u201cThere are still some headwinds in the industry, not least the continuation of the deflationary cycle \u2026 but we have some level of confidence given the rounded nature of our performance,\u201d Coupe said. Coupe would not comment on whether Sainsbury\u2019s planned to raise its offer for Home Retail Group, but the stronger-than-expected sales will be a boost to the supermarket\u2019s bid hopes. He said the strong performance at Sainsbury\u2019s showed that his strategy outlined in November 2014 was working, and the chain was outperforming the likes of Asda, Morrisons and Tesco. \u201cArgos represents an opportunity to accelerate that [strategy] but it is by no means a must do deal. There\u2019s a price and we won\u2019t go beyond that. We\u2019ll maintain a level of financial discipline \u2026 There is no reason why Sainsbury\u2019s won\u2019t be a successful company in future without the Argos transaction taking place,\u201d he said. The Sainsbury\u2019s cash and shares deal, agreed with Home Retail last month, is competing against an all-cash offer from the South African retail group Steinhoff International, the owner of Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK. Both companies have an18 March deadline to agree a formal offer, and Sainsbury\u2019s is widely expected to raise its bid to \u00a31.5bn or 185p a share from about 170p currently. Any rise in the Sainsbury\u2019s share price automatically boosts the value of a potential bid, so Coupe is likely to have been disappointed that the grocer\u2019s shares slipped nearly 1% in Tuesday morning trading to 278p, despite its better-than-expected sales performance. Steinhoff has proposed a 175p a share offer and is examining Home Retail\u2019s books with a view to making a formal bid.",

Total sales were lifted by a 14% rise in online grocery sales, 10% rise in sales of clothing and 11% lift in sales of entertainment products, such as CDs and DVDs, buoyed by the release of Adele\u2019s latest album and the Bond film Spectre. </p> <p>Ideas that cater to new food trends, such as ready made \u201ccourgetti\u201d \u2013 spaghetti made from courgettes \u2013 and \u201cboodles\u201d \u2013 noodles made from butternut squash \u2013 also helped attract new shoppers.</p> <p>Food price deflation slowed at Sainsbury\u2019s to between 1% and 1.5% from 1.5% and 2% over the previous six months as the retailer annualised price cuts made last year. The company said underlying sales at its large supermarkets were flat to slightly down, with the vast majority of growth coming from online. </p> <p> The performance was a step up from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/13/sainsburys-christmas-sales-better-than-expected\">0.4% fall in sales Sainsbury\u2019s delivered in the 15 weeks to 9 January</a>, and above analysts\u2019 forecasts. The City had expected Sainsbury\u2019s to reveal further sales declines but its upturn came after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/morrisons-returns-to-profit-as-sales-start-to-rise\">Morrisons revealed its first quarterly sales growth in four years last week</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Mike Coupe, chief executive, said Sainsbury\u2019s had delivered a strong performance over the quarter as it increased both the number of till-based transactions and the average number of items shoppers put in their baskets. </p> <p>He said better service and availability as well as a move away from promotions to regularly available lower prices had helped drive sales. \u201cWe have traded well this year and are making excellent progress implementing our strategy. The market will remain competitive but we are confident that we will continue to outperform our major peers,\u201d Coupe added.</p> <p>With a reference to a comment from Asda\u2019s boss, Andy Clarke,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/asda-quarterly-loss-christmas\"> who saw sales fall further after suggesting performance had bottomed out</a>, Coupe said he was not going to suggest Sainsbury\u2019s had passed a nadir. \u201cIt\u2019s very premature to call the turn,\u201d he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ccbeeb017bb6b7135434b4b686d10d44683d36c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ccbeeb017bb6b7135434b4b686d10d44683d36c/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sainsbury\u2019s chief Mike Coupe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sainsbury\u2019s chief Mike Coupe, who says he remains confident the grocer will continue outperform its peers this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Flack/Sainsbury's/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coupe said he expected prices to continue to fall for at least six months, adding that Sainsbury\u2019s was ready to go \u201ctoe-to-toe\u201d with competitors and had the financial firepower to do so.</p> <p>\u201cThere are still some headwinds in the industry, not least the continuation of the deflationary cycle \u2026 but we have some level of confidence given the rounded nature of our performance,\u201d Coupe said.<br></p> <p>Coupe would not comment on whether Sainsbury\u2019s planned to raise its offer for Home Retail Group, but the stronger-than-expected sales will be a boost to the supermarket\u2019s bid hopes.</p> <p>He said the strong performance at Sainsbury\u2019s showed that his strategy outlined in November 2014 was working, and the chain was outperforming the likes of Asda, Morrisons and Tesco.</p> <p>\u201cArgos represents an opportunity to accelerate that [strategy] but it is by no means a must do deal. There\u2019s a price and we won\u2019t go beyond that. We\u2019ll maintain a level of financial discipline \u2026 There is no reason why Sainsbury\u2019s won\u2019t be a successful company in future without the Argos transaction taking place,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>The Sainsbury\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/02/sainsburys-agrees-terms-13bn-deal-buy-home-retail-group\">cash and shares deal, agreed with Home Retail last month</a>, is competing against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/19/home-retail-group-receives-takeover-offer-111m-pounds-higher-than-sainsburys\">an all-cash offer from the South African retail group Steinhoff International, the owner of Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK</a>.</p> <p>Both companies have an18 March deadline to agree a formal offer, and Sainsbury\u2019s is widely expected to raise its bid to \u00a31.5bn or 185p a share from about 170p currently.</p> <p>Any rise in the Sainsbury\u2019s share price automatically boosts the value of a potential bid, so Coupe is likely to have been disappointed that the grocer\u2019s shares slipped nearly 1% in Tuesday morning trading to 278p, despite its better-than-expected sales performance.<br></p> <p>Steinhoff has proposed a 175p a share offer and is examining Home Retail\u2019s books with a view to making a formal bid.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Balfour Beatty has seen its underlying full year losses increase but it says its turnaround plan is showing signs of progress. The construction group fell \u00a3123m into the red in 2015, worse than the \u00a380m loss seen in the previous year, due to problematic contracts in Britain, the middle east and Asia. But it hoped to be rid of the bulk of its troublesome UK contracts by the end of this year, and its decision to scrap its dividend, cancel a share buyback and reorganise its pension fund payments have all helped to strengthen its balance sheet. Now it expects to reinstate its dividend \u201cat an appropriate level\u201d at August\u2019s half year results. Chief executive Leo Quinn, who joined last March, said: Coming into 2015 the business performance had deteriorated as a decade of forced growth culminated in an overly complex business, poor contract discipline and unaffordable overhead costs. Decisive action was taken to arrest the decline...Half way through...the group is on course to deliver on [its] specific targets. The company said its order book and revenues were stabilising, with a strong pipeline of opportunities. But its shares have dipped 1.9p to 257.3p. Numis analysts said: UK losses were always going to be the key feature of results, but we believe the tangible management progress on costs and cash performance set the scene for movement back to profit in 2016. We contend that the majority of legacy issues will be eliminated this year, and outline here our 2018 estimates [pretax profits of \u00a3185m and earnings per share of 23.5p] which are driven by management initiatives to give Balfour the strongest recovery profile in the sector. Meantime the ongoing value of, and investment in, the PPP [public\u2013private partnership] portfolio continues to provide strong underpinning at the current share price. We therefore expect a progressive re-rating from special situation to recovery stock for the company - in an industry which is only at the start of the upturn in terms of government investment and industry recovery. Liberum said the 2015 results were \u201cmessy\u201d but added Improving market conditions and self-help should provide a powerful cocktail, implying a recovered 2018 PE of 13.5 times. Our 320p target price is based on a sum of the parts. We value the PPP business at \u00a31.5bn, consisting of the around \u00a31.2bn portfolio and the much overlooked PPP pipeline, where Balfour intends to spend \u00a3250m over the next five years. Given that these investments are already reflected in our cash flows and net debt estimates, and that historical, albeit high, valuations have been 2 times book, we believe that it is actually very prudent to value the pipeline at \u00a3250m. We also believe there is positive value in the Construction business in spite of it being loss making in 2015, and we see a 2.5% margin as achievable in the business medium term.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Balfour Beatty</strong> has seen its underlying full year losses increase but it says its turnaround plan is showing signs of progress.</p> <p>The construction group fell \u00a3123m into the red in 2015, worse than the \u00a380m loss seen in the previous year, due to problematic contracts in Britain, the middle east and Asia. But it hoped to be rid of the bulk of its troublesome UK contracts by the end of this year, and its decision to scrap its dividend, cancel a share buyback and reorganise its pension fund payments have all helped to strengthen its balance sheet. Now it expects to reinstate its dividend \u201cat an appropriate level\u201d at August\u2019s half year results. Chief executive Leo Quinn, who joined last March, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Coming into 2015 the business performance had deteriorated as a decade of forced growth culminated in an overly complex business, poor contract discipline and unaffordable overhead costs.</p> <p>Decisive action was taken to arrest the decline...Half way through...the group is on course to deliver on [its] specific targets.</p> </blockquote> <p>The company said its order book and revenues were stabilising, with a strong pipeline of opportunities. But its shares have dipped 1.9p to 257.3p. </p> <p>Numis analysts said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UK losses were always going to be the key feature of results, but we believe the tangible management progress on costs and cash performance set the scene for movement back to profit in 2016. We contend that the majority of legacy issues will be eliminated this year, and outline here our 2018 estimates [pretax profits of \u00a3185m and earnings per share of 23.5p] which are driven by management initiatives to give Balfour the strongest recovery profile in the sector.</p> <p>Meantime the ongoing value of, and investment in, the PPP [public\u2013private partnership] portfolio continues to provide strong underpinning at the current share price. We therefore expect a progressive re-rating from special situation to recovery stock for the company - in an industry which is only at the start of the upturn in terms of government investment and industry recovery.</p> </blockquote> <p>Liberum said the 2015 results were \u201cmessy\u201d but added</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Improving market conditions and self-help should provide a powerful cocktail, implying a recovered 2018 PE of 13.5 times. Our 320p target price is based on a sum of the parts. We value the PPP business at \u00a31.5bn, consisting of the around \u00a31.2bn portfolio and the much overlooked PPP pipeline, where Balfour intends to spend \u00a3250m over the next five years. Given that these investments are already reflected in our cash flows and net debt estimates, and that historical, albeit high, valuations have been 2 times book, we believe that it is actually very prudent to value the pipeline at \u00a3250m. We also believe there is positive value in the Construction business in spite of it being loss making in 2015, and we see a 2.5% margin as achievable in the business medium term.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "The decline of Britain\u2019s nightclub scene has forced the government\u2019s independent data gatherers to exclude admission prices to late night dance venues from the official inflation figures. The Office for National Statistics said the closure of scores of nightclubs in recent years and the shift to free or low cost entry for many of those that remain meant the prices were harder to gather and no longer a useful guide to inflation in the hospitality sector. Among the other items excluded from the 704 items in the basket of goods used to calculate inflation were CD-Roms and rewritable DVDs, \u201creflecting the change in the computer market away from physical media and towards downloadable files\u201d. Additions to the basket included computer software, such as for word processing, antivirus or web design, and downloaded computer games, Nespresso-style coffee pods and cream liqueur (such as Baileys). Women\u2019s leggings have also been added, in part because women\u2019s clothing is an under-covered area of the basket, the ONS said. In food, microwave rice has also been added, reflecting the longer-term trend towards prepared foods. The basket has expanded since the 1940s, when it included only 65 foods, compared to more than 150 today. Some food staples \u2013 like bread, milk and tea \u2013 have stayed while others have found themselves unloved by subsequent generations. Canned corned beef was in the first basket and was only removed in 2005. Cooked, sliced turkey is the fashion victim in 2016 and will be replaced by a combined turkey and chicken category. Partly this reflects the ONS mission to shift the balance away from measuring food items, which it thinks are over-representated, and partly it is a measure of turkey\u2019s relative slide in popularity outside the Christmas season. The consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation recently edged up to 0.3% after alcohol and tobacco rose by 1.3% compared with January 2015, when there were heavy discounts on beer. The ONS said the annual inflation rate was also higher than in December after fuel and food prices dropped less than they did a year ago. But despite the rise in CPI, the Bank of England predicts inflation will remain far below the government\u2019s 2% target for some time yet. What\u2019s in and what\u2019s out In: Pouches of microwave rice Joins a range of prepared foods, emphasising Britons love of ready meals. Multipacks of meat The ONS has spotted a boom in cooking cuts of meat and presenting them buffet-style. Cooked sliced turkey/chicken Turkey has been joined by chicken, which is becoming more popular. Lemons Ignored until now, lemons join oranges and other citrus fruit. Large chocolate bars A boom in larger chocolate bars sold in supermarkets has forced the ONS to include them. Coffee pods Made popular by George Clooney in his adverts for Nespresso, coffee pods are all the rage. Cream liqueur For some time Britons have demanded sweeter alcoholic drinks leading the ONS to include Baileys and its rival cream liqueurs. Women\u2019s leggings Obviously an oversight by the ONS, as it admits when it says: \u201cA type of clothing not currently covered but widely purchased.\u201d Boys\u2019 T-shirts The ONS said: \u201cReplaces boys\u2019 branded sports tops to enable representation of both casual and sportswear clothing.\u201d Paint, gloss/emulsion Not so much a new item as a merger that reduces the weighting put on DIY sales. Computer software Software downloads replace CD-Roms in recognition of a shift to online sales and storage. Computer game downloads Such is the boom in sales, game downloads get their own category in an area the ONS admits is under-covered. Restaurant main course The last few years have seen a boom in restaurant visits, but the ONS said it is over-covered in the basket and has merged meat or fish main courses and vegetarian main meals. Nail varnish The rise and rise of the nail bar accounts for a boom in nail varnish sales and its inclusion for the first time in the inflation basket. Out Organic dessert apples The popularity of organic fruit allows the ONS to merge organic apples with other dessert apples. Organic carrots Likewise, organic carrots are removed \u201cdue to organic produce becoming mainstream with less distinction from non-organic products\u201d. Boys\u2019 branded sports tops Replaced by a boys\u2019 T-shirt \u201cto enable representation of both casual and sportswear clothing,\u201d said the ONS. Power points Power sockets sold in DIY stores were removed from an over-represented category to make way for other items. Prescription lenses Removed from an over-covered area of the basket and lenses are still represented by spectacle frames with single vision lens. Rewritable DVDs A declining technology which is being superseded by streaming services and YouView-style personal video recorders (PVRs). CD-Roms Excluded in recognition of the shift to people increasingly downloading software. Nightclub entry A collapse in the number of nightclubs charging entry is the main reason for their exclusion. Pub hot or cold snacks Chips (and salad) with everything means pub customers rarely buy a hot or cold snack on its own. Restaurant main course, meat/fish Too much emphasis in the inflation figures on restaurant prices has triggered a rethink and merger of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes for the purpose of calculating average prices. Restaurant main course, vegetarian Now part of merged main meal category, see above.",

Retail losses increased to \u00a315.6m from \u00a311.3m and the group\u2019s underlying operating loss widened to \u00a34.7m from \u00a3800,000. French Connection said its problems came in the first half of the year, when it lost \u00a37.9m after shoppers gave the thumbs down to its spring 2015 collection. The company hired new design chiefs and its winter range was more popular, helping produce a second-half profit. Despite the more upbeat outlook, the value of the company\u2019s shares, which have almost doubled since the end of September, fell 10% to 39.8p. French Connection\u2019s fortunes have waned since it caught the public\u2019s attention in the 1990s with its FCUK logo, which reappeared this year. It has battled to keep up with rivals such as Zara on the high street and Asos online and has been through a series of false dawns with signs of improved sales proving short-lived. Stephen Marks, French Connection\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said: \u201cOverall the performance for the year has been disappointing due to the very poor first half but the improvement we have seen during the second half and into the new financial year shows that we are definitely moving in the right direction.\u201d French Connection announced two appointments designed to strengthen its board.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Just after midday on 25 November last year, Paul Johnson arrived at Millbank Studios, a pale stone building, used by news broadcasters, diagonally opposite the Palace of Westminster. Johnson, who is 49 and gangly, was riding a Brompton folding bicycle, his left suit trouser leg tucked into a red sock. (He claims to own socks of no other colour.) Johnson is the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent economic research organisation that occupies a unique position in British political life. Though other outfits attempt similar work, the IFS stands apart: when it comes to economic policy, its assessments have, for many, become the closest approximation to revealed truth. \u201cIt is quite extraordinary in a way that it is regarded as the ultimate authority,\u201d says Robert Peston, the former economics editor of the BBC and now the political editor of ITV news. \u201cBasically, when the IFS has pronounced, there\u2019s no other argument. It is the word of God.\u201d Johnson had been summoned to the broadcast studios on the occasion of the autumn statement, one of two announcements the Treasury is mandated to make to parliament annually. (The budget, which is typically delivered in the spring, outlines the government\u2019s revenues and expenditure for the coming financial year; the autumn statement combines an update on progress since the last budget with economic growth forecasts.) Both events are major pieces of political theatre \u2013 and the IFS now plays a crucial role in their reception. If the chancellor is the impresario of the day\u2019s performance, then the IFS has become Westminster\u2019s most prominent \u2013 and feared \u2013 theatre critic. For both the autumn statement and budget, the chancellor stands up in the House of Commons to deliver his speech at 12.30pm. Immediately after the speech, Johnson and his deputy commence a tour of the TV studios, offering immediate takes on the chancellor\u2019s offering. Meanwhile, back at IFS headquarters in Fitzrovia, some of the brightest economic minds in Britain begin combing over documents that have just been released by the Treasury. The 24 hours that follow are the busiest days of the year for the IFS. The institute\u2019s staff must move quickly to calculate how much each new policy will cost, or benefit, certain sections of society, using a huge computerised model of the British tax and benefits system. More broadly, the IFS economists \u2013 many of whom are still in their 20s \u2013 assess whether the chancellor\u2019s political rhetoric matches the harder reality of the numbers. This work, which continues late into the night, fuelled by takeaway pizza, involves a search for where the Treasury has buried this year\u2019s bodies \u2013 and an attempt to reconcile the complexities of academic economics with the media\u2019s demand for straightforward answers. \u201cRanges are for cattle,\u201d US president Lyndon Johnson supposedly once quipped to an economic adviser. \u201cGive me one number.\u201d A select team drawn from among the IFS\u2019s 40 full-time research staffers must race to build their findings into a presentation that is delivered at 1pm the following day \u2013 under the watchful eyes of all of Britain\u2019s political, economic and media establishment. What the IFS says about the chancellor\u2019s budget determines the public narrative about what the government has actually done. At a time when the British media, public, and political establishment are all fiercely polarised, the institute\u2019s findings are taken as gospel. No one can doubt its enormous authority. But how did one small economic research institute come to occupy such a commanding position in British public life? * * * Outside Millbank Studios last November Johnson, whose manner is cheerful and slightly awkward, met his deputy, a 41-year old LSE graduate named Carl Emmerson. Together they climbed the stone flagged stairs of the studios. At 12.30, when George Osborne stood to address the House of Commons, Johnson was ensconced in a booth in the BBC zone. In front of him lay a plate of sandwiches and a sheaf of freshly released documents from the Treasury. With headphones clamped over his ears, and his body hunched in concentration, Johnson watched the chancellor deliver his speech. Osborne began by promising \u201cfar reaching changes to what the state does and how it does it\u201d. The main thrust came 10 minutes later, when he abandoned a proposed cut to tax credits that had caused him considerable political vexation over the preceding months \u2013 partly thanks to the IFS\u2019s initial criticism of Osborne\u2019s plan. In a summer budget on 8 July 2015, after the general election, Osborne had announced a cut to tax credits as part of a series of measures to shave \u00a312bn from the welfare bill. The following day, at its post-budget presentation, the IFS claimed that the policy would cost 13 million families an average of \u00a3260 per year. A further three million would be more than \u00a31,000 worse off annually. Johnson himself said the measure would hurt the poor \u201cmuch more\u201d than the rich. The Financial Times, the Guardian, the BBC and the Independent all ran the story, prominently referencing the IFS. In October, the Sun launched a campaign under the headline \u201cTax credits cut bonkers\u201d, using a single father of two named George Osborne \u2013 annual income \u00a36,760 \u2013 to illustrate its theory. In November, the other Osborne did a U-turn. When the chancellor\u2019s speech was done, Johnson\u2019s real work began. He sat for makeup and then toured the Millbank studios, first to a BBC set-up transmitting to BBC 2, the BBC News Channel and BBC Parliament. There Johnson sought to explain that Osborne\u2019s change in policy was more cosmetic than the chancellor had suggested \u2013 that the overall cuts would in the long run be just as sharp as they were going to be when first outlined in July 2015. The key point was that, following reforms to the welfare system, new benefits claimants would receive less than at present. Johnson was playing his translator role, putting the numbers into \u2013 relatively speaking \u2013 plain English. \u201cOn that tax credit point, it is terribly important to be clear that he has changed nothing in the long run,\u201d he said. Later, Johnson and Emmerson headed to College Green, the rectangle of distressed grass where Westminster broadcasters stage their exterior shots. It was now past three o\u2019clock and Johnson\u2019s left trouser was still tucked into his sock. As he moved from live broadcast to live broadcast, he was constantly greeted by fellow members of the political and media establishment. On the Millbank Studio stairs he bantered with Robert Peston; on a lobby sofa outside a Sky News studio, Johnson discussed his choice of tie with Nigel Lawson, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s longest-serving chancellor. But it was in the Sky studio itself that the IFS\u2019s position as the ultimate explainer and umpire of British politics came into sharp focus. The Sky anchor Dermot Murnaghan sat in a studio, framed by bars of illuminated red and blue. \u201cAh my God, the man that knows,\u201d Murgnahan roared, off-air, when Johnson arrived. \u201cI feel I\u2019m here in a Penn and Teller show,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to explain what happens.\u201d * * * This week, following Osborne\u2019s budget speech on Wednesday afternoon, Johnson and his researchers will work far into the night preparing their response. The IFS occupies the top two floors of a 1960s office block on Ridgmount Street in Fitzrovia. The office is blandly corporate \u2013 staffers use PCs rather than Apple computers, and there is not a beanbag in sight. Venetian blinds hem the windows and bookshelves hold copies of Fiscal Studies, the institute\u2019s house journal. Most IFS staff \u2013 who invariably refer to their employer as \u201cIFS\u201d with the definite article elided \u2013 join straight out of undergraduate or masters programmes. Altogether 40 of the overall headcount of 60 are full-time \u201cresearch economists\u201d, while others are mostly senior academics with part-time affiliations. Their wardrobe is a contrast to the corporate look of the office \u2013 the younger staffers dress like members of a university debating team: Superdry T-shirts, Adidas trainers, zip-off trekking trousers. They are expected to scrub up for TV appearances, and a room in the basement, equipped with an ISDN line for static-free radio interviews, holds racked suit jackets alongside damp cycling clothes. On budget days the institute obtains no special information before the chancellor\u2019s speech, nor does it gain access to embargoed media briefings. Last November, by the time Johnson returned from Millbank in the middle of the afternoon, the work back at IFS headquarters was well under way. The IFS\u2019s autumn statement analysis was done by three teams, whose work corresponds to the areas they study in their day-to-day research. The most potentially explosive work took place downstairs. There, four young men clustered at desks strewn with papers, Fox\u2019s biscuits, a copy of Accountancy magazine and a packet of Tyrkisk Peber, a liquorice candy popular in Scandinavia. Andrew Hood, James Browne, Stuart Adam and Rob Joyce work on \u201cdirect tax and welfare\u201d, performing the distributional analysis that has become the IFS trademark, calculating how much policy change will cost certain groups. Upstairs, two further teams were at work. The first, led by Gemma Tetlow, 34, focused on big-picture spending, while David Phillips, 30, led the final team, focusing on local government and devolution. Johnson patrolled among the teams like a gallery owner, carefully polishing his treasures before unveiling them to the public. Johnson and Emmerson also placed calls to Treasury director Stuart Glassborow to seek clarification or check points of fact. One former Treasury official told me that there was always \u201can open line with a junior nerd at the IFS\u201d on budget day, pointing out it is in the interest of neither side to get detail wrong. At 6.30pm, the pizzas arrived, fresh from Olivelli, an establishment near the British Museum, and the staff gathered to eat in the common room on the third floor. Afterwards, as evening drew into night and deadlines approached, the atmosphere was calm. The scene resembled the performance of other complex tasks by an experienced team: shades of the aircraft cockpit or the operating theatre. (Exceptions are not unknown, however: Johnson told me a staffer once became so panic stricken on budget night they had to go home early.) Before each team went to bed, the researchers sent on their draft slides for the following day\u2019s presentation, on blue and green IFS-branded templates, to Johnson and Emmerson. The director and his deputy provided overnight feedback. Gemma Tetlow, the last economist standing, left the office at 1.15am. The next morning, \u201cIFS day\u201d, as one former lobby correspondent terms it, started early. Johnson rose at six for the Today Programme, while staff were assembled in Ridgmount Street by about 8.30am. Those individuals selected to present \u2013 chosen by a process of relative democracy and a ruthless assessment of their social skills \u2013 wore suits. They rehearsed in front of Emmerson in the basement. The first slide of Tetlow\u2019s presentation bore George Osborne\u2019s face superimposed on Bob the Builder\u2019s body. The caption read: \u201cGeorge the Builder: he can fix it (just not today \u2013 he\u2019s enjoying the Sun)\u201d. That morning, the Sun had triumphantly announced \u201cTax credit cuts scrapped by George Osborne in U-turn after Sun campaign.\u201d In rehearsal Tetlow ran to twice her planned 20-minute length. \u201cSerious butchering,\u201d in her words, ensued. At a few minutes before 1pm, the team decamped from Ridgmount Street and crossed Gower Street to the University of London campus. In the lobby outside the Beveridge Hall, much of the UK\u2019s political and media establishment, identifiable by 270 plastic lapel badges, had gathered. Johnson spoke first. \u201cThe first thing to say is that this is not the end of austerity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis spending review is still one of the tightest in postwar history.\u201d Tetlow followed, but this day belonged to Andrew Hood, who ran through his findings on how Osborne\u2019s policies would affect welfare recipients. After the slides had slid, the press surrounded Hood, desperate to hear more from this young man who seemed to know more about the benefits system than anyone outside government. It was clearly exciting for Hood; he was relishing this moment after hours immersed in TAXBEN, the IFS\u2019s computerised economic model. As Johnson had done, Hood sought to explain just how the apparent U-turn by Osborne meant rather less than it seemed, especially over the long term. As with Johnson, though, not everyone got the message. \u201cCan I try something in journalese on you?\u201d asked a reporter. \u201cTry,\u201d Hood replied. The reporter slipped into copy mode, and presented Hood with a news line about how many people would be affected by benefits changes in the next five years. Hood mulled. \u201cLet me think about this. Can I replace \u2018Over five to 10 years\u2019 with \u2018In the long run?\u2019\u201d \u201cUmm, newsdesk says no,\u201d the reporter answered, to collective laughter from his peers. Hood continued to walk his recalcitrant audience through points of detail that they struggled to understand. At one stage he broke from spending several minutes outlining exactly why a certain, apparently simple conclusion was in fact wrong, to examine the rolling TV coverage. \u201cSky News have just reported exactly the line I\u2019ve just told Sam he\u2019s not allowed to print,\u201d Hood lamented. \u201cToo late now,\u201d said another reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s news. Too late.\u201d * * * The origins of the IFS go back to a bachelor weekend in 1967 at the Bell, a ritzy red-brick pub in the Buckinghamshire village of Aston Clinton. Four city men attended: tax consultant John Chown, investment manager Bob Buist, stockbroker Nils Taube and banker Will Hopper. Chown, who is now 86, recalls the Aston Clinton meeting as an opportunity \u201cto have the four of us together for a weekend with no distractions apart from the fact that we were getting well fed and watered\u201d. The four men were bound together by a collective disgruntlement at the introduction of corporation tax by James Callaghan, then chancellor, in 1965. At the Bell, each man wrote an article on an aspect of tax, which they offered collectively to William Rees-Mogg, then editor of the Times. They expected the pieces to seep into print gradually, but Rees-Mogg ran them together on 10 April 1967, under the headline \u201cA charter for the tax reform.\u201d A reproduction of this piece now hangs in the basement of the IFS office. Encouraged by the response to their article, in July the following year Chown, Buist, Taube and Hopper decided over supper at Stella Alpina, an Italian restaurant in Mayfair, to found an institute. The minutes Hopper made afterwards stated that the principal objective was \u201cto study the economic impact of existing taxes and proposed changes in the fiscal system\u201d. The intention was for an independent \u201cresearch society\u201d, rather than a \u201cpropaganda society\u201d. Hopper proposed the name, including the use of \u201cfor\u201d rather than \u201cof\u201d, a move that has persistently confused outsiders down the decades. In 1969 the IFS was formally incorporated as a limited company and the following year, Dick Taverne, the Labour MP for Lincoln and former financial secretary to the Treasury, became the part-time director for the new body. In 1970s Britain though, the IFS struggled to make headway. As an organisation with no established track record it could not attract top-flight staff, and its work attracted little attention. In an attempt to raise its profile, in 1975 the IFS created the Meade committee, a wholesale examination of the British tax system led by James Meade, a renowned former Cambridge economist. Meade was assisted by two young economists: John Kay, who would go on to become director of the IFS, and Mervyn King, who would later become governor of the Bank of England. The report it produced ran to 533 pages, took three years to prepare, and during this period Meade won the Nobel prize for economics for his earlier work on international trade and capital movement. On its publication in 1978, The Structure and Reform of Direct Taxation commanded five full pages of coverage in the Financial Times, and helped to solidify the IFS\u2019s reputation. Yet funding was hand-to-mouth, relying mainly on corporate donations, with periodic infusions from grant-giving bodies such as the Gatsby Foundation. Evan Davis, now the presenter of Newsnight, arrived at the IFS in the summer of 1983 as an intern during his Oxford PPE degree, and returned full time the next year. He recalls on one occasion raiding a skip in order to acquire partitions for the office, which had relocated to Castle Lane in Victoria. (Though the partitions were not, as far as he remembers, actually used.) In 1979, John Kay took over as director of the IFS. In his first few years in charge, it remained a scrappy outsider throwing stones at Whitehall. Relationships with government in general \u2013 and the civil service in particular, who perceived a trespass on their traditional expertise \u2013 were thorny. If some of the 1980s battles were part of the growing process of a new institution, Kay agrees that his personality may have also played a role in the IFS-government spats. \u201cI am impatient to get things done,\u201d he told me. After Kay and two colleagues, Andrew Dilnot and Nicholas Morris, published a book that was critical of the Inland Revenue, Laurence Airey, the chairman of the board of the Revenue, summoned Kay into an enormous ballroom in Somerset House, which then held the Revenue\u2019s headquarters, and screamed at him for 15 minutes. When Kay interjected to ask for the specifics of Airey\u2019s grievance Airey shouted back: \u201cI\u2019m too angry to give details.\u201d Kay, who is now a columnist for the Financial Times, recalls stepping down in 1986, emotionally exhausted by repeated tussles with the civil service machine. But under his tenure, the IFS\u2019s public profile undoubtedly grew. In 1982 the IFS published its first \u201cgreen budget\u201d, which came out well before the budget, and aimed to lay out the issues at stake in the contemporary debate. The \u201cgreen budget\u201d continues to this day. The following year, the IFS presented its first \u201crapid response\u201d to the budget, although at the first attempt the institute was not ready to go public with its \u201crapid\u201d take until three weeks after the chancellor\u2019s speech. Andrew Dilnot recalls limited media attention in the 1983 general election campaign. Four years later, the situation was very different. In the 1987 election campaign Dilnot found himself spending \u201cmost nights\u201d at the BBC studios. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the IFS\u2019s public profile continued to grow, but the wrangles with government did not entirely vanish. When Gordon Brown was chancellor, he came to see the IFS, then under the leadership of Robert Chote, as a major antagonist. During that time, it fell to Damian McBride to present Brown with the \u201csnaps\u201d \u2013 immediate coverage of breaking news \u2013 of the IFS post-budget press conferences. Before McBride could speak, Brown would grab the paper from his hands and yell a single word: \u201cChote!\u201d (Inevitably, \u201cChote!\u201d became a catchphrase among Treasury staff.) McBride believes the IFS was incentivised to pick holes in the budget because negative announcements drew more publicity. \u201cIt [the IFS] caused us more problems than the Tory party,\u201d he told me. McBride was happy to fight back, however, once describing Paul Johnson to a journalist as a \u201cfailed Treasury economist\u201d. Alistair Darling, who succeeded Brown as Labour chancellor on Tony Blair\u2019s departure in 2007, was less choleric, but he still acknowledged the potential problems posed by the IFS. \u201cOf course it\u2019s irritating and inconvenient when the IFS offers a critical view the day after a budget,\u201d he said. \u201cBut frankly you have to take these things in the round.\u201d * * * The IFS owes its prominence, in large part, to the media. It has been so successful at attracting press attention, in fact, that other thinktanks regularly contact Paul Johnson asking how they too might pick up such lavish coverage. But the secret of its success \u2013 aside from a well-drilled PR operation \u2013 is simple. First, many journalists are not confident with numbers; they want a reliable source they can turn to. (When I asked former IFS staffers for examples of the worst questions journalists had asked them, the wince-making responses included \u201cHow do you work out a percentage?\u201d) The explosive calculation, last July, that Osborne\u2019s proposed tax credit cut could cost some families upwards of \u00a31,000 per year was made simply by taking the government\u2019s projected saving and dividing it by the number of people who would be affected. That was primary school arithmetic \u2013 but it became potent only when it was stamped with the IFS imprimatur. Second, the perception that the IFS is an impartial umpire means that harried broadcasters do not have to find someone to represent the \u201cother side\u201d. The official IFS position is that it has no ideological agenda \u2013 that its work is beholden only to data. (\u201cYou can referee data,\u201d Andrew Dilnot likes to say.) The IFS has built its reputation on this rigid focus on microeconomics: they will assess the costs of new policies, or the impact of tax changes, but they studiously avoid \u201cbig picture\u201d questions such as the causes of the 2008 financial crisis, or the wisdom of government borrowing. (Bonnie Brimstone, who heads communications for the IFS, routinely turns down press requests that fall outside this regular furrow.) This narrow focus is the source of some criticism \u2013 particularly given the influence of the IFS on public debate about economics. Robert Peston argues that the IFS\u2019s emphasis on microeconomic matters has steered British media coverage in a similar direction. \u201cEverybody \u2013 BBC, ITV, newspapers \u2013 obsesses about what the IFS says about who the winners and losers are,\u201d Peston told me. \u201cNobody really gets into the whole issue of whether austerity, for example, is good or bad for growth. Did George Osborne\u2019s cuts at the start of the 2010 parliament make Britain richer or poorer?\u201d The Oxford macroeconomist Simon Wren-Lewis makes a similar point, arguing that the financial crisis, and the ensuing need for governments to undertake fiscal stimulus \u2013 borrowing and spending to spur economic growth \u2013 meant that one had to look beyond narrow microeconomic questions. After 2008, Wren-Lewis said, \u201cyou needed some macro knowledge to talk about the budget \u2013 about what fiscal changes would be effective at boosting demand \u2013 which the IFS does not have\u201d. Some left-leaning economists look with particular scepticism on the claim that the IFS has no ideology, arguing that the institute holds an excessive faith in the power of market forces. The tax expert Richard Murphy, a professor of political economy at City University who advised in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign for the Labour leadership, said the IFS was \u201cembedded in all the normal, standard pro-market assumptions that dominate conventional economic thinking in the UK and elsewhere\u201d. Howard Reed, who worked at the IFS for nearly a decade and now runs an economics consultancy that has produced work for the Trades Union Congress and the thinktank Demos, took issue with the organisation\u2019s view of itself as an impartial arbiter. \u201cSuppose you\u2019re a football referee,\u201d Reed said, \u201cand you don\u2019t realise the pitch is sloped \u2013 you can try your best to be neutral, but one team might win five-nil just because of the way the pitch is set up.\u201d Allies of the current government have a different complaint with the IFS \u2013 that its distributional analyses, which show the impact of policy changes on various groups, only give a snapshot at the instant the changes are implemented, rather than their effects over time. This has led some on the right to argue that the IFS has not captured the way in which recent changes to welfare and tax credit policy may change behavioural incentives over the long term. \u201cIn a sense, those dynamic questions are probably more important,\u201d said Rupert Harrison, a former IFS staffer who served as George Osborne\u2019s chief of staff until 2015. None of these criticisms are news to Johnson. \u201cFor nearly everything we do,\u201d he said, \u201cyes, we\u2019ve got an economic framework around it \u2013 but actually we\u2019re describing data. It\u2019s the data that is doing the talking.\u201d * * * In 1974, two American political scientists, Hugh Heclo and Aaron Wildavsky, published an influential book about the workings of the British state called The Private Government of Public Money, which argued that an extraordinarily small clique of officials, who know one another well, dominate Britain\u2019s decisions about taxation and spending. More than 40 years later, while the IFS vaunts its independence, multiple ties bind Ridgmount Street, Whitehall and Westminster. For instance, Paul Johnson served in the Treasury between his first stint at the IFS and returning as director. Prior to the IFS, Johnson was tutorial partner at Keble College Oxford to Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor. Balls\u2019s pre-government journalistic career at the FT moved in parallel to Robert Chote\u2019s, who was then at the Independent. Chote preceded Johnson as director of the IFS. During his tenure at the IFS, Chote\u2019s wife Sharon White was building a career at the Treasury that would culminate in her role as second permanent secretary at the department. In 1997 Gus O\u2019Donnell, who would go on to become head of the civil service, was in Washington as the UK executive director on the boards of the IMF and World Bank; he held a wedding party at his house for Chote and White. Later, when Chote wrote to Gus O\u2019Donnell to bemoan the Treasury briefing against the IFS, he ended his letter with the words \u201cWe have all known each other for a long time \u2026\u201d In the three decades since Laurence Airey screamed at John Kay in Somerset House, the scrappy outsider has become an accepted part of the establishment \u2013 and a pathway for individual elevation to its ranks. Today the IFS recruits between one and four researchers each year. They receive 400 applications. Nothing is a greater testimony to the growing power of the IFS than the decision made by George Osborne in 2010 to create a counterpart inside the government. On his accession as chancellor, he established an independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), in order to take the business of economic forecasting out of the Treasury in the name of greater independence. Though the IFS does not itself engage in forecasting, and nor does the OBR do distributional analysis, by dint of its position as a quasi-external oversight body, the OBR did venture onto traditional IFS turf. Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator, suggests that the motivation behind Osborne\u2019s decision to create the OBR was to dent the public profile of the IFS, which many conservatives felt skewed leftwards, owing to the perceived tendency of British academic economists to favour big government and big spending. Last year sunny economic forecasts by the OBR provided Osborne with an extra \u00a327bn that permitted his U-turn on tax credits. In the days after the statement, some commentators suggested that the optimistic economic forecast was an example of possible OBR capitulation to political will. However, Robert Chote, the former IFS director who is now chairman of the OBR, is adamant about his organisation\u2019s independence, and last month a Treasury select committee report indicated that while Treasury civil servants did try to lean on the OBR in the run up to the publication of the office\u2019s earlier forecasts in December 2014, the OBR resisted. Perhaps the best way to understand the relative positions \u2013 and prospects \u2013 of the IFS and the OBR is to see them as part of a decades-long struggle to tame an over-mighty Treasury. Britain is rare among European countries to have no separation between the finance ministry, responsible for short-term matters, and an economics ministry, which traditionally manages longer-term issues. As Robert Laslett, former chief economist for pensions at the Department for Work and Pensions remarks, attempted governance mechanisms that do not have an absolute separation from mother Treasury tend to run into trouble. They are, in his words, \u201cpiglets too close to the sow\u201d. The IFS today occupies a quasi-constitutional role in British life, but without the scrutiny on management and funding that applies to formal government bodies. Its separation from government may be one of the best explanations for its success. For the IFS itself though, life goes on. On Monday, four months after the autumn statement and two days prior to the budget, Johnson and his team were gearing up to do it all over again. With rumbles afoot in the stock market, and following the Bank of England\u2019s decrease to its earnings and peak growth forecasts, he suspected the OBR would downgrade its economic forecasts. \u201cTo the extent that things are changing in the economy it looks like they\u2019re changing in the wrong direction,\u201d he said. However, Johnson emphasised that ultimately he and his team would not know how things would go down until Wednesday, when George Osborne stands up in parliament. \u201cI don\u2019t have any more idea than anyone else I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we\u2019re sort of as ready as we ever are.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "body": "<p>Just after midday on 25 November last year, Paul Johnson arrived at Millbank Studios, a pale stone building, used by news broadcasters, diagonally opposite the Palace of Westminster. Johnson, who is 49 and gangly, was riding a Brompton folding bicycle, his left suit trouser leg tucked into a red sock. (He claims to own socks of no other colour.)</p> <p>Johnson is the director of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>, an independent economic research organisation that occupies a unique position in British political life. Though other outfits attempt similar work, the IFS stands apart: when it comes to economic policy, its assessments have, for many, become the closest approximation to revealed truth.</p> <p>\u201cIt is quite extraordinary in a way that it is regarded as the ultimate authority,\u201d says Robert Peston, the former economics editor of the BBC and now the political editor of ITV news. \u201cBasically, when the IFS has pronounced, there\u2019s no other argument. It is the word of God.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson had been summoned to the broadcast studios on the occasion of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/autumn-statement-2015\">autumn statement</a>, one of two announcements the Treasury is mandated to make to parliament annually. (The budget, which is typically delivered in the spring, outlines the government\u2019s revenues and expenditure for the coming financial year; the autumn statement combines an update on progress since the last budget with economic growth forecasts.) Both events are major pieces of political theatre \u2013 and the IFS now plays a crucial role in their reception. If the chancellor is the impresario of the day\u2019s performance, then the IFS has become Westminster\u2019s most prominent \u2013 and feared \u2013 theatre critic.</p> <p>For both the autumn statement and budget, the chancellor stands up in the House of Commons to deliver his speech at 12.30pm. Immediately after the speech, Johnson and his deputy commence a tour of the TV studios, offering immediate takes on the chancellor\u2019s offering. Meanwhile, back at IFS headquarters in Fitzrovia, some of the brightest economic minds in Britain begin combing over documents that have just been released by the Treasury.</p> <p>The 24 hours that follow are the busiest days of the year for the IFS. The institute\u2019s staff must move quickly to calculate how much each new policy will cost, or benefit, certain sections of society, using a huge computerised model of the British tax and benefits system. More broadly, the IFS economists \u2013 many of whom are still in their 20s \u2013 assess whether the chancellor\u2019s political rhetoric matches the harder reality of the numbers.</p> <p>This work, which continues late into the night, fuelled by takeaway pizza,<strong> </strong>involves a search for where the Treasury has buried this year\u2019s bodies \u2013 and an attempt to reconcile the complexities of academic economics with the media\u2019s demand for straightforward answers. \u201cRanges are for cattle,\u201d US president Lyndon Johnson supposedly once quipped to an economic adviser. \u201cGive me one number.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Basically, when the IFS has pronounced, there\u2019s no other argument. It is the word of God</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Peston</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A select team drawn from among the IFS\u2019s 40 full-time research staffers must race to build their findings into a presentation that is delivered at 1pm the following day \u2013 under the watchful eyes of all of Britain\u2019s political, economic and media establishment.</p> <p>What the IFS says about the chancellor\u2019s budget determines the public narrative about what the government has actually done. At a time when the British media, public, and political establishment are all fiercely polarised, the institute\u2019s findings are taken as gospel. No one can doubt its enormous authority. But how did one small economic research institute come to occupy such a commanding position in British public life?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Outside Millbank Studios</strong> last November Johnson, whose manner is cheerful and slightly awkward, met his deputy, a 41-year old LSE graduate named Carl Emmerson. Together they climbed the stone flagged stairs of the studios. At 12.30, when George Osborne stood to address the House of Commons, Johnson was ensconced in a booth in the BBC zone. In front of him lay a plate of sandwiches and a sheaf of freshly released documents from the Treasury. With headphones clamped over his ears, and his body hunched in concentration, Johnson watched the chancellor deliver his speech.</p> <p>Osborne began by promising \u201cfar reaching changes to what the state does and how it does it\u201d. The main thrust came 10 minutes later, when he abandoned a proposed cut to tax credits that had caused him considerable political vexation over the preceding months \u2013 partly thanks to the IFS\u2019s initial criticism of Osborne\u2019s plan.</p> <p>In a summer budget on 8 July 2015, after the general election, Osborne had announced a cut to tax credits as part of a series of measures to shave \u00a312bn from the welfare bill. The following day, at its post-budget presentation, the IFS claimed that the policy would cost 13 million families an average of \u00a3260 per year. A further three million would be more than \u00a31,000 worse off annually. Johnson himself said the measure would hurt the poor \u201cmuch more\u201d than the rich.</p> <p>The Financial Times, the Guardian, the BBC and the Independent all ran the story, prominently referencing the IFS. In October, the Sun launched a campaign under the headline \u201cTax credits cut bonkers\u201d, using a single father of two named George Osborne \u2013 annual income \u00a36,760 \u2013 to illustrate its theory. In November, the other Osborne did a U-turn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/ifs-picks-the-budget-to-pieces-again\">IFS picks the budget to pieces \u2026 again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the chancellor\u2019s speech was done, Johnson\u2019s real work began. He sat for makeup and then toured the Millbank studios, first to a BBC set-up transmitting to BBC 2, the BBC News Channel and BBC Parliament. There Johnson sought to explain that Osborne\u2019s change in policy was more cosmetic than the chancellor had suggested \u2013 that the overall cuts would in the long run be just as sharp as they were going to be when first outlined in July 2015. The key point was that, following reforms to the welfare system, new benefits claimants would receive less than at present. Johnson was playing his translator role, putting the numbers into \u2013 relatively speaking \u2013 plain English. \u201cOn that tax credit point, it is terribly important to be clear that he has changed nothing in the long run,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Later, Johnson and Emmerson headed to College Green, the rectangle of distressed grass where Westminster broadcasters stage their exterior shots. It was now past three o\u2019clock and Johnson\u2019s left trouser was still tucked into his sock. As he moved from live broadcast to live broadcast, he was constantly greeted by fellow members of the political and media establishment. On the Millbank Studio stairs he bantered with Robert Peston; on a lobby sofa outside a Sky News studio, Johnson discussed his choice of tie with Nigel Lawson, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s longest-serving chancellor. But it was in the Sky studio itself that the IFS\u2019s position as the ultimate explainer and umpire of British politics came into sharp focus.</p> <p>The Sky anchor Dermot Murnaghan<strong> </strong>sat in a studio, framed by bars of illuminated red and blue. \u201cAh my God, the man that knows,\u201d Murgnahan roared, off-air, when Johnson arrived. \u201cI feel I\u2019m here in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jun/18/penn-and-teller-secrets-of-tv-magic\">Penn and Teller</a> show,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to explain what happens.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"05793d4f8c5451f165e6733b6fca1bf45a187aea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05793d4f8c5451f165e6733b6fca1bf45a187aea/201_453_5559_3336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"IFS director Paul Johnson (right) and Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor of the exchequer, wait to appear on Sky TV.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">IFS director Paul Johnson (right) and Nigel Lawson, a former chancellor of the exchequer, wait to appear on Sky TV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>This week, following Osborne\u2019s budget speech</strong> on Wednesday afternoon, Johnson and his researchers will work far into the night preparing their response.</p> <p>The IFS occupies the top two floors of a 1960s office block on Ridgmount Street in Fitzrovia. The office is blandly corporate \u2013 staffers use PCs rather than Apple computers, and there is not a beanbag in sight. Venetian blinds hem the windows and bookshelves hold copies of Fiscal Studies, the institute\u2019s house journal.</p> <p>Most IFS staff \u2013 who invariably refer to their employer as \u201cIFS\u201d with the definite article elided \u2013 join straight out of undergraduate or masters programmes. Altogether 40 of the overall headcount of 60 are full-time \u201cresearch economists\u201d, while others are mostly senior academics with part-time affiliations. Their wardrobe is a contrast to the corporate look of the office \u2013 the younger staffers dress like members of a university debating team: Superdry T-shirts, Adidas trainers, zip-off trekking trousers. They are expected to scrub up for TV appearances, and a room in the basement, equipped with an ISDN line for static-free radio interviews, holds racked suit jackets alongside damp cycling clothes.</p> <p>On budget days the institute obtains no special information before the chancellor\u2019s speech, nor does it gain access to embargoed media briefings. Last November, by the time Johnson returned from Millbank in the middle of the afternoon, the work back at IFS headquarters was well under way.</p> <p>The IFS\u2019s autumn statement analysis was done by three teams, whose work corresponds to the areas they study in their day-to-day research. The most potentially explosive work took place downstairs. There, four young men clustered at desks strewn with papers, Fox\u2019s biscuits, a copy of Accountancy magazine and a packet of Tyrkisk Peber, a liquorice candy popular in Scandinavia. Andrew Hood, James Browne, Stuart Adam and Rob Joyce work on \u201cdirect tax and welfare\u201d, performing the distributional analysis that has become the IFS trademark, calculating how much policy change will cost certain groups.</p> <p>Upstairs, two further teams were at work. The first, led by Gemma Tetlow, 34, focused on big-picture spending, while David Phillips, 30, led the final team, focusing on local government and devolution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/26/autumn-statement-ifs-warns-on-tax-rises-spending-cuts-george-osborne\">Spending review will still leave poor families worse off, say experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson patrolled among the teams like a gallery owner, carefully polishing his treasures before unveiling them to the public. Johnson and Emmerson also placed calls to Treasury director Stuart Glassborow to seek clarification or check points of fact. One former Treasury official told me that there was always \u201can open line with a junior nerd at the IFS\u201d on budget day, pointing out it is in the interest of neither side to get detail wrong.</p> <p>At 6.30pm, the pizzas arrived, fresh from Olivelli, an establishment near the British Museum, and the staff gathered to eat in the common room on the third floor. Afterwards, as evening drew into night and deadlines approached, the atmosphere was calm. The scene resembled the performance of other complex tasks by an experienced team: shades of the aircraft cockpit or the operating theatre. (Exceptions are not unknown, however: Johnson told me a staffer once became so panic stricken on budget night they had to go home early.)</p> <p>Before each team went to bed, the researchers sent on their draft slides for the following day\u2019s presentation, on blue and green IFS-branded templates, to Johnson and Emmerson. The director and his deputy provided overnight feedback. Gemma Tetlow, the last economist standing, left the office at 1.15am.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08af8693f3a97277ffdd5f4cb9d9a77636fc3a09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08af8693f3a97277ffdd5f4cb9d9a77636fc3a09/0_146_5560_3336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Johnson and his IFS colleagues eat pizza before analysing George Osborne\u2019s 2015 autumn statement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Johnson and his IFS colleagues eat pizza before analysing George Osborne\u2019s 2015 autumn statement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next morning, \u201cIFS day\u201d, as one former lobby correspondent terms it, started early. Johnson rose at six for the Today Programme, while staff were assembled in Ridgmount Street by about 8.30am. Those individuals selected to present \u2013 chosen by a process of relative democracy and a ruthless assessment of their social skills \u2013 wore suits. They rehearsed in front of Emmerson in the basement. The first slide of Tetlow\u2019s presentation bore George Osborne\u2019s face superimposed on Bob the Builder\u2019s body. The caption read: \u201cGeorge the Builder: he can fix it (just not today \u2013 he\u2019s enjoying the Sun)\u201d. That morning, the Sun had triumphantly announced \u201cTax credit cuts scrapped by George Osborne in U-turn after Sun campaign.\u201d In rehearsal Tetlow ran to twice her planned 20-minute length. \u201cSerious butchering,\u201d in her words, ensued.</p> <p>At a few minutes before 1pm, the team decamped from Ridgmount Street and crossed Gower Street to the University of London campus. In the lobby outside the Beveridge Hall, much of the UK\u2019s political and media establishment, identifiable by 270 plastic lapel badges, had gathered.</p> <p>Johnson spoke first. \u201cThe first thing to say is that this is not the end of austerity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis spending review is still one of the tightest in postwar history.\u201d Tetlow followed, but this day belonged to Andrew Hood, who ran through his findings on how Osborne\u2019s policies would affect welfare recipients. After the slides had slid, the press surrounded Hood, desperate to hear more from this young man who seemed to know more about the benefits system than anyone outside government. It was clearly exciting for Hood; he was relishing this moment after hours immersed in TAXBEN, the IFS\u2019s computerised economic model.</p> <p>As Johnson had done, Hood sought to explain just how the apparent U-turn by Osborne meant rather less than it seemed, especially over the long term. As with Johnson, though, not everyone got the message.</p> <p>\u201cCan I try something in journalese on you?\u201d asked a reporter.</p> <p>\u201cTry,\u201d Hood replied.</p> <p>The reporter slipped into copy mode, and presented Hood with a news line about how many people would be affected by benefits changes in the next five years.</p> <p>Hood mulled. \u201cLet me think about this. Can I replace \u2018Over five to 10 years\u2019 with \u2018In the long run?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUmm, newsdesk says no,\u201d the reporter answered, to collective laughter from his peers.</p> <p>Hood continued to walk his recalcitrant audience through points of detail that they struggled to understand.</p> <p>At one stage he broke from spending several minutes outlining exactly why a certain, apparently simple conclusion was in fact wrong, to examine the rolling TV coverage.</p> <p>\u201cSky News have just reported exactly the line I\u2019ve just told Sam he\u2019s not allowed to print,\u201d Hood lamented.</p> <p>\u201cToo late now,\u201d said another reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s news. Too late.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The origins of the IFS</strong> go back to a bachelor weekend in 1967 at the Bell, a ritzy red-brick pub in the Buckinghamshire village of Aston Clinton. Four city men attended: tax consultant John Chown, investment manager Bob Buist, stockbroker Nils Taube and banker Will Hopper. Chown, who is now 86, recalls the Aston Clinton meeting as an opportunity \u201cto have the four of us together for a weekend with no distractions apart from the fact that we were getting well fed and watered\u201d.</p> <p>The four men were bound together by a collective disgruntlement at the introduction of corporation tax by James Callaghan, then chancellor, in 1965. At the Bell, each man wrote an article on an aspect of tax, which they offered collectively to William Rees-Mogg, then editor of the Times. They expected the pieces to seep into print gradually, but Rees-Mogg ran them together on 10 April 1967, under the headline \u201cA charter for the tax reform.\u201d A reproduction of this piece now hangs in the basement of the IFS office.</p> <p>Encouraged by the response to their article, in July the following year Chown, Buist, Taube and Hopper decided over supper at Stella Alpina, an Italian restaurant in Mayfair, to found an institute. The minutes Hopper made afterwards stated that the principal objective was \u201cto study the economic impact of existing taxes and proposed changes in the fiscal system\u201d. The intention was for an independent \u201cresearch society\u201d, rather than a \u201cpropaganda society\u201d. Hopper proposed the name, including the use of \u201cfor\u201d rather than \u201cof\u201d, a move that has persistently confused outsiders down the decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c5e4d61068d21ff096fca3811ad2933c7abb656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c5e4d61068d21ff096fca3811ad2933c7abb656/0_337_5760_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson on his way to an interview about the autumn statement outside parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson on his way to an interview about the autumn statement outside parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1969 the IFS was formally incorporated as a limited company and the following year, Dick Taverne, the Labour MP for Lincoln and former financial secretary to the Treasury, became the part-time director for the new body. In 1970s Britain though, the IFS struggled to make headway. As an organisation with no established track record it could not attract top-flight staff, and its work attracted little attention. In an attempt to raise its profile, in 1975 the IFS created the Meade committee, a wholesale examination of the British tax system led by James Meade, a renowned former Cambridge economist. Meade was assisted by two young economists: John Kay, who would go on to become director of the IFS, and Mervyn King, who would later become governor of the Bank of England.</p> <p>The report it produced ran to 533 pages, took three years to prepare, and during this period Meade won the Nobel prize for economics for his earlier work on international trade and capital movement. On its publication in 1978, <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/docs/meade.pdf\">The Structure and Reform of Direct Taxation</a> commanded five full pages of coverage in the Financial Times, and helped to solidify the IFS\u2019s reputation. Yet funding was hand-to-mouth, relying mainly on corporate donations, with periodic infusions from grant-giving bodies such as the Gatsby Foundation. Evan Davis, now the presenter of Newsnight, arrived at the IFS in the summer of 1983 as an intern during his Oxford PPE degree, and returned full time the next year. He recalls on one occasion raiding a skip in order to acquire partitions for the office, which had relocated to Castle Lane in Victoria. (Though the partitions were not, as far as he remembers, actually used.)</p> <p>In 1979, John Kay took over as director of the IFS. In his first few years in charge, it remained a scrappy outsider throwing stones at Whitehall. Relationships with government in general \u2013 and the civil service in particular, who perceived a trespass on their traditional expertise \u2013 were thorny. If some of the 1980s battles were part of the growing process of a new institution, Kay agrees that his personality may have also played a role in the IFS-government spats. \u201cI am impatient to get things done,\u201d he told me. After Kay and two colleagues, Andrew Dilnot and Nicholas Morris, published a book that was critical of the Inland Revenue, Laurence Airey, the chairman of the board of the Revenue, summoned Kay into an enormous ballroom in Somerset House, which then held the Revenue\u2019s headquarters, and screamed at him for 15 minutes. When Kay interjected to ask for the specifics of Airey\u2019s grievance Airey shouted back: \u201cI\u2019m too angry to give details.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/08/ifs-warns-market-turmoil-could-leave-black-hole-in-osbornes-plans\">IFS warns market turmoil could leave black hole in George Osborne's plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kay, who is now a columnist for the Financial Times, recalls stepping down in 1986, emotionally exhausted by repeated tussles with the civil service machine. But under his tenure, the IFS\u2019s public profile undoubtedly grew. In 1982 the IFS published its first \u201cgreen budget\u201d, which came out well before the budget, and aimed to lay out the issues at stake in the contemporary debate. The \u201cgreen budget\u201d continues to this day. The following year, the IFS presented its first \u201crapid response\u201d to the budget, although at the first attempt the institute was not ready to go public with its \u201crapid\u201d take until three weeks after the chancellor\u2019s speech. Andrew Dilnot recalls limited media attention in the 1983 general election campaign. Four years later, the situation was very different. In the 1987 election campaign Dilnot found himself spending \u201cmost nights\u201d at the BBC studios.</p> <p>During the 1990s and early 2000s, the IFS\u2019s public profile continued to grow, but the wrangles with government did not entirely vanish. When Gordon Brown was chancellor, he came to see the IFS, then under the leadership of Robert Chote, as a major antagonist. During that time, it fell to Damian McBride to present Brown with the \u201csnaps\u201d \u2013 immediate coverage of breaking news \u2013 of the IFS post-budget press conferences. Before McBride could speak, Brown would grab the paper from his hands and yell a single word: \u201cChote!\u201d (Inevitably, \u201cChote!\u201d became a catchphrase among Treasury staff.)</p> <p>McBride believes the IFS was incentivised to pick holes in the budget because negative announcements drew more publicity. \u201cIt [the IFS] caused us more problems than the Tory party,\u201d he told me. McBride was happy to fight back, however, once describing Paul Johnson to a journalist as a \u201cfailed Treasury economist\u201d.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, who succeeded Brown as Labour chancellor on Tony Blair\u2019s departure in 2007, was less choleric, but he still acknowledged the potential problems posed by the IFS. \u201cOf course it\u2019s irritating and inconvenient when the IFS offers a critical view the day after a budget,\u201d he said. \u201cBut frankly you have to take these things in the round.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The IFS owes its prominence,</strong> in large part, to the media. It has been so successful at attracting press attention, in fact, that other thinktanks regularly contact Paul Johnson asking how they too might pick up such lavish coverage. But the secret of its success \u2013 aside from a well-drilled PR operation \u2013 is simple. First, many journalists are not confident with numbers; they want a reliable source they can turn to. (When I asked former IFS staffers for examples of the worst questions journalists had asked them, the wince-making responses included \u201cHow do you work out a percentage?\u201d) The explosive calculation, last July, that Osborne\u2019s proposed tax credit cut could cost some families upwards of \u00a31,000 per year was made simply by taking the government\u2019s projected saving and dividing it by the number of people who would be affected. That was primary school arithmetic \u2013 but it became potent only when it was stamped with the IFS imprimatur.</p> <p>Second, the perception that the IFS is an impartial umpire means that harried broadcasters do not have to find someone to represent the \u201cother side\u201d. The official IFS position is that it has no ideological agenda \u2013 that its work is beholden only to data. (\u201cYou can referee data,\u201d Andrew Dilnot likes to say.) The IFS has built its reputation on this rigid focus on microeconomics: they will assess the costs of new policies, or the impact of tax changes, but they studiously avoid \u201cbig picture\u201d questions such as the causes of the 2008 financial crisis, or the wisdom of government borrowing. (Bonnie Brimstone, who heads communications for the IFS, routinely turns down press requests that fall outside this regular furrow.)</p> <p>This narrow focus is the source of some criticism \u2013 particularly given the influence of the IFS on public debate about economics. Robert Peston argues that the IFS\u2019s emphasis on microeconomic matters has steered British media coverage in a similar direction. \u201cEverybody \u2013 BBC, ITV, newspapers \u2013 obsesses about what the IFS says about who the winners and losers are,\u201d Peston told me. \u201cNobody really gets into the whole issue of whether austerity, for example, is good or bad for growth. Did George Osborne\u2019s cuts at the start of the 2010 parliament make Britain richer or poorer?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"786dfa52928aaa37e47cbb051af2bb23f8a3bf5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/786dfa52928aaa37e47cbb051af2bb23f8a3bf5b/574_125_4439_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Johnson (right) and Robert Peston (the BBC\u2019s economics editor at the time) prepare to discuss George Osborne\u2019s 2015 autumn statement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Johnson (right) and Robert Peston (the BBC\u2019s economics editor at the time) prepare to discuss George Osborne\u2019s 2015 autumn statement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Oxford macroeconomist Simon Wren-Lewis makes a similar point, arguing that the financial crisis, and the ensuing need for governments to undertake fiscal stimulus \u2013 borrowing and spending to spur economic growth \u2013 meant that one had to look beyond narrow microeconomic questions. After 2008, Wren-Lewis said, \u201cyou needed some macro knowledge to talk about the budget \u2013 about what fiscal changes would be effective at boosting demand \u2013 which the IFS does not have\u201d.</p> <p>Some left-leaning economists look with particular scepticism on the claim that the IFS has no ideology, arguing that the institute holds an excessive faith in the power of market forces. The tax expert Richard Murphy, a professor of political economy at City University who advised in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign for the Labour leadership, said the IFS was \u201cembedded in all the normal, standard pro-market assumptions that dominate conventional economic thinking in the UK and elsewhere\u201d. Howard Reed, who worked at the IFS for nearly a decade and now runs an economics consultancy that has produced work for the Trades Union Congress and the thinktank Demos, took issue with the organisation\u2019s view of itself as an impartial arbiter. \u201cSuppose you\u2019re a football referee,\u201d Reed said, \u201cand you don\u2019t realise the pitch is sloped \u2013 you can try your best to be neutral, but one team might win five-nil just because of the way the pitch is set up.\u201d</p> <p>Allies of the current government have a different complaint with the IFS \u2013 that its distributional analyses, which show the impact of policy changes on various groups, only give a snapshot at the instant the changes are implemented, rather than their effects over time. This has led some on the right to argue that the IFS has not captured the way in which recent changes to welfare and tax credit policy may change behavioural incentives over the long term. \u201cIn a sense, those dynamic questions are probably more important,\u201d said Rupert Harrison, a former IFS staffer who served as George Osborne\u2019s chief of staff until 2015.</p> <p>None of these criticisms are news to Johnson. \u201cFor nearly everything we do,\u201d he said, \u201cyes, we\u2019ve got an economic framework around it \u2013 but actually we\u2019re describing data. It\u2019s the data that is doing the talking.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>In 1974, two American political scientists, </strong>Hugh Heclo and Aaron Wildavsky, published an influential book about the workings of the British state called The Private Government of Public Money, which argued that an extraordinarily small clique of officials, who know one another well, dominate Britain\u2019s decisions about taxation and spending. More than 40 years later, while the IFS vaunts its independence, multiple ties bind Ridgmount Street, Whitehall and Westminster.</p> <p>For instance, Paul Johnson served in the Treasury between his first stint at the IFS and returning as director. Prior to the IFS, Johnson was tutorial partner at Keble College Oxford to Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor. Balls\u2019s pre-government journalistic career at the FT moved in parallel to Robert Chote\u2019s, who was then at the Independent. Chote preceded Johnson as director of the IFS. During his tenure at the IFS, Chote\u2019s wife Sharon White was building a career at the Treasury that would culminate in her role as second permanent secretary at the department. In 1997 Gus O\u2019Donnell, who would go on to become head of the civil service, was in Washington as the UK executive director on the boards of the IMF and World Bank; he held a wedding party at his house for Chote and White. Later, when Chote wrote to Gus O\u2019Donnell to bemoan the Treasury briefing against the IFS, he ended his letter with the words \u201cWe have all known each other for a long time \u2026\u201d</p> <p>In the three decades since Laurence Airey screamed at John Kay in Somerset House, the scrappy outsider has become an accepted part of the establishment \u2013 and a pathway for individual elevation to its ranks. Today the IFS recruits between one and four researchers each year. They receive 400 applications.</p> <p>Nothing is a greater testimony to the growing power of the IFS than the decision made by George Osborne in 2010 to create a counterpart inside the government. On his accession as chancellor, he established an independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), in order to take the business of economic forecasting out of the Treasury in the name of greater independence. Though the IFS does not itself engage in forecasting, and nor does the OBR do distributional analysis, by dint of its position as a quasi-external oversight body, the OBR did venture onto traditional IFS turf.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"79722735155cd77a10d481642335b2c8ae0eef1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79722735155cd77a10d481642335b2c8ae0eef1b/0_344_5760_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Johnson in his office at the IFS in central London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Johnson in his office at the IFS in central London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator, suggests that the motivation behind Osborne\u2019s decision to create the OBR was to dent the public profile of the IFS, which many conservatives felt skewed leftwards, owing to the perceived tendency of British academic economists to favour big government and big spending.</p> <p>Last year sunny economic forecasts by the OBR provided Osborne with an extra \u00a327bn that permitted his U-turn on tax credits. In the days after the statement, some commentators suggested that the optimistic economic forecast was an example of possible OBR capitulation to political will. However, Robert Chote, the former IFS director who is now chairman of the OBR, is adamant about his organisation\u2019s independence, and last month a Treasury select committee report indicated that while Treasury civil servants did try to lean on the OBR in the run up to the publication of the office\u2019s earlier forecasts in December 2014, the OBR resisted.</p> <p>Perhaps the best way to understand the relative positions \u2013 and prospects \u2013 of the IFS and the OBR is to see them as part of a decades-long struggle to tame an over-mighty Treasury. Britain is rare among European countries to have no separation between the finance ministry, responsible for short-term matters, and an economics ministry, which traditionally manages longer-term issues. As Robert Laslett, former chief economist for pensions at the Department for Work and Pensions remarks, attempted governance mechanisms that do not have an absolute separation from mother Treasury tend to run into trouble. They are, in his words, \u201cpiglets too close to the sow\u201d.</p> <p>The IFS today occupies a quasi-constitutional role in British life, but without the scrutiny on management and funding that applies to formal government bodies. Its separation from government may be one of the best explanations for its success.</p> <p>For the IFS itself though, life goes on. On Monday, four months after the autumn statement and two days prior to the budget, Johnson and his team were gearing up to do it all over again. With rumbles afoot in the stock market, and following the Bank of England\u2019s decrease to its earnings and peak growth forecasts, he suspected the OBR would downgrade its economic forecasts. \u201cTo the extent that things are changing in the economy it looks like they\u2019re changing in the wrong direction,\u201d he said. However, Johnson emphasised that ultimately he and his team would not know how things would go down until Wednesday, when George Osborne stands up in parliament. \u201cI don\u2019t have any more idea than anyone else I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he added. \u201cSo we\u2019re sort of as ready as we ever are.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost 300 institutional investors in Volkswagen have filed a multi-billion dollar suit against the carmaker for what they claim were breaches of its stock market duty in the emissions cheating scandal. The lawsuit, for damages of \u20ac3.3bn ($3.6bn), was filed at a regional court in Braunschweig in VW\u2019s home state of Lower Saxony on Monday and is being brought by 278 investors from all over the world, including German insurers and US pension fund Calpers. In 2015 VW was caught using \u201cdefault device\u201d software to systematically cheat on US regulators\u2019 emissions tests. Martin Winterkorn, the global chief executive of VW, resigned in September 2015 in the near-immediate aftermath of the scandal, which wiped billions of euros off VW\u2019s market value and left the company facing fines of as much as $20bn and a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice. Law firm TISAB said the German lawsuit claims VW neglected to keep the markets properly informed between June 2008 and 18 September, 2015. A spokesman for VW said the carmaker could not comment because it had not been sent the suit. Volkswagen earlier this month published an account of the events leading to the violation of US emissions law being publicly announced by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The law firm has also filed a motion for a so-called model claims, a German legal procedure which \u2013 for lack of US style class-action lawsuits \u2013 uses court rulings won by individual investors as templates to set damages for others that are equally affected. Andreas Tilp, on eof the lead lawyers, said in a statement: \u201cDue to the fact that \u2013 according to our information and experience \u2013 Volkswagen AG persistently denies any settlement negotiations and also refuses to waive the statute of limitation defence until now, it was necessary to file this first multi-billion euro lawsuit.\u201d In October Tilp filed a lawsuit on behalf of retail investors.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There was never the slightest doubt that the CBI would back Britain remaining a part of the European Union. For all the talk while David Cameron was conducting his negotiations that the employers\u2019 organisation was in favour of remaining in a reformed union, it would not really have mattered had the prime minister come back from Brussels with a blank sheet of paper: he was always going to have the CBI onside. That\u2019s hardly surprising, given that the CBI membership includes some of the UK\u2019s biggest exporters, who have concerns about whether they would enjoy the same sort of access to the world\u2019s biggest market in the event of Brexit. CBI members do not speak with one voice, but 80% of those polled by Comres were in the remain camp and just 5% in the leave camp. Among small- and medium-sized companies, the majority was smaller but \u2013 at 71% \u2013 still sizeable. Four questions arise from the poll. The first, given the controversy about previous CBI membership surveys on Europe, is whether it was fair. Comres is a reputable company and sampled almost 800 companies using established methodology. There is no reason to doubt Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI\u2019s director general, when she says the survey is \u201crock solid\u201d. The second question is whether businesses have a right to air their views about such a sensitive issue. Clearly, it is legitimate for companies to speak up if they feel that they will be affected by the outcome of the referendum. But it is worth noting that the CBI poll reflects the views of the people running member companies and not those of the 7 million people who work for them. Question number three is whether the CBI members are right. There would certainly be short-term costs from Brexit in the form of weaker consumer confidence, deferred investment decisions and financial instability. Would the long term benefits outweigh the short-term costs as the outers say it would? That depends on a number of unknowns: the shape of any deal with the UK\u2019s former EU partners; the length of time it takes to negotiate that new arrangement; the ability of the UK to plug into markets in other parts of the world; and, crucially, whether the opportunity is taken to solve the UK\u2019s long-standing economic problems. Finally, there\u2019s the question of whether voters take any notice of what the CBI or any other lobby group says. It is hard to say, but the evidence of general elections is that what business says does matter. It might not matter as much as it did before the era of corporate scandals, rows over \u201cfat cat pay\u201d and the financial crisis, but it is a reasonable assumption that some of the undecideds will still be swayed. Is Sir Martin Sorrell worth it? When questioned about the size of his pay packet in the past, Sir Martin Sorrell runs the L\u2019Oreal defence: because I\u2019m worth it. The man who has built up WPP from scratch into the biggest marketing and advertising company in the world says he only does well if his shareholders are doing well. Sorrell\u2019s basic salary is \u00a31.1m, but once annual bonuses are added to his long-term bonus scheme he pocketed close to \u00a370m in 2015. What\u2019s wrong with that? Let\u2019s start with the obvious: there\u2019s something unhealthy and not a little repugnant about a chief executive earning 2,800 times as much as the average UK salary, and Sorrell ought to be able to appreciate that. What\u2019s more, high performance-related salaries are justified by the need to recruit and retain top people. Neither applies in Sorrell\u2019s case, since he started the company himself and at 71 is at the stage when he should be thinking hard about a succession strategy. The fact that there is nobody lined up to take his place at WPP should be a concern to the company\u2019s shareholders. The test of whether Sorrell needs \u00a370m to do a job he is good at and clearly enjoys will come next year when, as a result of a rebellion by shareholders in 2012, the long-term bonus scheme is phased out. At that point, he might walk away from WPP insisting that he is not getting what he is worth. Don\u2019t bank on it, though.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest business lobby group has emphatically endorsed staying inside the EU, adding weight to a series of polls showing that employers view a referendum vote to leave as a threat to the UK\u2019s prosperity. Giving its backing to a pro-EU vote, the CBI said 80% of its membership wanted to remainand only 5% would support Brexit. It said the survey backed up a string of votes across the organisation\u2019s regional and national committees in favour of continued membership. Firms backing the EU said that their business would suffer without full access to the single market and the UK would lose out in the battle for foreign investment against countries inside the trading bloc. The poll comes a fortnight after the British Chambers of Commerce, triggered a political storm after the suspension of its director general for making comments sympathetic to the Brexit campaign. Despite its own membership surveys showing a majority in favour of remaining inside the EU, the BCC has adopted a neutral stance. It accepted John Longworth\u2019s resignation after he said he planned to expand on his anti-EU views. Accusations that No 10 leaned on the BCC to get rid of Longworth were denied by both parties. The CBI\u2019s director general Carolyn Fairbairn, said she had not talked to ministers or No 10 about her organisation\u2019s public view on the referendum vote. The CBI, which has a membership that employs almost 7 million people, said its stance was based on a poll of 773 businesses supplemented by majority votes from 24 regional councils and national committees. \u201cThe message from our members is resounding \u2013 most want the UK to stay in the EU because it is better for their business, jobs and prosperity,\u201d she said. \u201cA vote to leave would mean that the existing relationship falls away and a long period of uncertainty would hit foreign direct investment. We know the foreign companies and funds interested in big investment projects would think twice if the UK was outside the EU,\u201d she added, saying the CBI would not be backing any of the pro-EU political campaigns. Recent polls by other business organisations have shown that executives are broadly in favour of staying in the EU following David Cameron\u2019s efforts to win safeguards from European leaders in Brussels last month. A snap poll organised by the Institute of Directors showed that six in 10 executives supported the plan, while a similar finding was reported by the EEF manufacturers\u2019 organisation. The main difference was that 31% of the IoD members questioned said they wanted Britain to leave the union, with only 9% saying they had yet to make up their mind, compared with 15% of CBI members. Fairbairn said CBI members were concerned about losing access to a tariff-free market of 500 million people and being cut off from more than 30 global trade deals covering 50 countries. She said: \u201cThese significant advantages outweigh the frustrations\u201d. But the terms of Cameron\u2019s dealwere only \u201ca milestone on the road to reform\u201d and further moves were needed to enhance the single market and reduce regulation. The survey found that multinational businesses were the most in favour of staying inside the EU, but in an effort to ward off criticism that the organisation represents the interest of big business, it highlighted a 71% vote against Brexit by small and medium-sized business members. It said: \u201cA minority of members want to leave the EU. We will continue to respect and reflect their views and campaign for EU reform to get a better deal for all businesses. \u201cHowever, most CBI members are unconvinced that alternatives to full membership would offer the same opportunities. We have yet to see those who seek to leave the EU present a compelling vision of what this would mean for jobs and growth.\u201d Paul Drechsler, CBI president, said business leaders would focus on \u201cthe business and economic issues at stake\u201d and steer clear of political concerns. \u201cWe will seek to inform the public debate focussing on the implications for jobs, prices and prosperity,\u201d he said.",

It said the survey backed up a string of votes across the organisation\u2019s regional and national committees in favour of continued membership.</p> <p>Firms backing the EU said that their business would suffer without full access to the single market and the UK would lose out in the battle for foreign investment against countries inside the trading bloc.</p> <p>The poll comes a fortnight after the British Chambers of Commerce, triggered a political storm after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/04/british-chambers-of-commerce-boss-suspended-in-brexit-row-reports-say\">suspension of its director general</a> for making comments sympathetic to the Brexit campaign.</p> <p>Despite its own membership surveys showing a majority in favour of remaining inside the EU, the BCC has adopted a neutral stance. It accepted John Longworth\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/06/john-longworth-resigns-as-commerce-boss-over-brexit\"> resignation</a> after he said he planned to expand on his anti-EU views.</p> <p>Accusations that No 10 leaned on the BCC to get rid of Longworth were denied by both parties. The CBI\u2019s director general Carolyn Fairbairn, said she had not talked to ministers or No 10 about her organisation\u2019s public view on the referendum vote. The CBI, which has a membership that employs almost 7 million people, said its stance was based on a poll of 773 businesses supplemented by majority votes from 24 regional councils and national committees.</p> <p>\u201cThe message from our members is resounding \u2013 most want the UK to stay in the EU because it is better for their business, jobs and prosperity,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cA vote to leave would mean that the existing relationship falls away and a long period of uncertainty would hit foreign direct investment. We know the foreign companies and funds interested in big investment projects would think twice if the UK was outside the EU,\u201d she added, saying the CBI would not be backing any of the pro-EU political campaigns.</p> <p>Recent polls by other business organisations have shown that executives are broadly in favour of staying in the EU following David Cameron\u2019s efforts to win safeguards from European leaders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/19/camerons-eu-deal-what-he-wanted-and-what-he-got\">in Brussels last month</a>.</p> <p>A snap poll organised by the<a href=\"http://www.iod.com/\"> Institute of Directors</a> showed that six in 10 executives supported the plan, while a similar finding was reported by the <a href=\"https://www.eef.org.uk/\">EEF manufacturers\u2019 organisation</a>.<br></p> <p>The main difference was that 31% of the IoD members questioned said they wanted Britain to leave the union, with only 9% saying they had yet to make up their mind, compared with 15% of CBI members. </p> <p>Fairbairn said CBI members were concerned about losing access to a tariff-free market of 500 million people and being cut off from more than 30 global trade deals covering 50 countries.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThese significant advantages outweigh the frustrations\u201d. But the terms of Cameron\u2019s dealwere only \u201ca milestone on the road to reform\u201d and further moves were needed to enhance the single market and reduce regulation.</p> <p>The survey found that multinational businesses were the most in favour of staying inside the EU, but in an effort to ward off criticism that the organisation represents the interest of big business, it highlighted a 71% vote against Brexit by small and medium-sized business members.</p> <p>It said: \u201cA minority of members want to leave the EU. We will continue to respect and reflect their views and campaign for EU reform to get a better deal for all businesses.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, most CBI members are unconvinced that alternatives to full membership would offer the same opportunities. We have yet to see those who seek to leave the EU present a compelling vision of what this would mean for jobs and growth.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Drechsler, CBI president, said business leaders would focus on \u201cthe business and economic issues at stake\u201d and steer clear of political concerns. \u201cWe will seek to inform the public debate focussing on the implications for jobs, prices and prosperity,\u201d he said.</p>",
