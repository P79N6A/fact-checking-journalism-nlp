      "bodyText": "One of the three candidates in the race to head the World Bank has pulled out, calling the selection process a \"political exercise\". The departure of Colombian economist Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo means that America is almost certain to cement its grip on the poverty-fighting institution tomorrow, as Jim Yong Kim, the White House's chosen candidate, is confirmed as its latest president. Ocampo urged developing nations to back Kim's only remaining rival, Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who has the backing of the World Bank's African members. Kim, a Korean-born health campaigner hand-picked by President Obama, looks certain to be chosen if, as is traditional, Europe throws its weight behind America's choice for the job. But charities have reacted angrily to what they see as a stitch-up by rich western countries. Elizabeth Stuart, of Oxfam, said: \"This election has still not been open or transparent. The world deserves better than a sham selection process with a forgone conclusion.\" Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said: \"It is patently wrong that nationality should trump other criteria when deciding who leads the World Bank. The organisation exists to fight poverty, yet until now those with hands-on experience of doing so have barely had a chance at the top job. \"This is a golden opportunity to appoint a president whose experience means they will drive change and put the interests of the world's poor first.\" Canada, Mexico and Japan have already said that they will support Kim, who has been on a whistle-stop tour of world capitals \u2013 accompanied by US Treasury officials \u2013 in a bid to win support for his candidacy. If European governments also back him, his position will be assured. Ever since the bank and its sister institution the International Monetary Fund were set up in the aftermath of the second world war following the Bretton Woods conference on international monetary policy, the Europeans have chosen the boss of the IMF and the Americans the World Bank president, under a so-called \"gentlemen's agreement\". Developing countries have won a greater voting share at both organisations in recent years to reflect the changing balance of power in the global economy. But they can still be outgunned by the old world. Anti-poverty campaigners have found it hard to object to Kim, who has a proven record in health policy in poor countries. But they are exasperated at a process that allows the US to put its man in the post despite World Bank rhetoric about an open and transparent recruitment process. Kim, who set up a non-governmental organisation called Partners in Health, which works to tackle HIV-Aids and other fatal diseases in poor countries, is a more radical candidate than many of the initial suggestions for the job including mooted for the job, which included the former treasury secretary Lawrence Summers, who once signed a memo at the World Bank saying that Africa was \"vastly underpolluted\", although the memo was said to be sarcastic. White House-watchers suggest that Obama may have been forced to seek out a less conservative name than Summers after Jeffrey Sachs, the anti-poverty campaigner, launched a public campaign for the nomination. There have also been rumours that some countries threatening to protest have been bought off with the offer of major international posts. \"The BRICs [Brazil, Russia, India and China] will get some consolation prizes,\" said one Bank-watcher. Professor Brook Baker, of Northeastern University, who has worked with Kim on health projects, said: \"One of the things Jim will probably look closely at is how to bring a different ideological perspective. He's not an uncritical proponent of the development model that's dominated for the past 30 years... I think he's going to say some things that will get him into trouble.\" Kim is currently president of Dartmouth College, where his tenure has been controversial, with some students and alumni claiming that he has failed to get to grips with the Ivy League university's troubled finances.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco boss Philip Clarke promised to roll up his sleeves and go back to the shop floor when he took charge of the UK chain last month, and on Friday he could be found patrolling the aisles of one of its newest London stores. Flanked by a camera crew, Clarke was pointing out what was new in store, from spotlit mounds of fresh produce to an inviting salad bar: \"These are some of the ways we are improving the shopping trip for customers,\" he told the Observer. The central London store is a daily stamping ground for thousands of office workers and Clark said the layout had been developed using Clubcard data to tailor its range to local shopping lists. The selection of upmarket ready meals and \u00a3150 magnums of Bollinger in the chiller cabinets hints at the high-fliers working in the nearby offices of Ernst &amp; Young, which boast a glamorous view of the Thames. On Wednesday, Clarke will face the City for the first time since Tesco's shock profit warning in January. He will be reporting annual profits of nearly \u00a33.9bn for the year to 25 February, a feat by any company's \u2013 let alone a UK retailer's \u2013 standards. But the figures are likely to be overlooked by investors poring over the numbers relating to the rejuvenation of the UK business, where years of penny-pinching and staff cuts have left stores threadbare, miserable places to shop. That something was wrong had been obvious to customers \u2013 if not the City \u2013 for some time. Of the more than 700 shoppers who logged on to the website of TV retail expert Mary Portas to review their experience of shopping at Tesco, many were disappointed, leaving comments such as \"staff are completely disinterested\" and \"store rarely has enough carrier bags \u2026 often have to leave food at the till\". The scores given by the army of secret shoppers ranked Tesco 99th out of 101 store groups based on customer service. For the last decade the UK business, which generates two-thirds of group profits, has been the cash cow that funded diversification into new countries and markets such as banking. The wheels came off at Christmas when, following the withdrawal of double Clubcard points, shoppers were lured to rivals' aggressive promotions. Tesco will have to spend nearly \u00a3400m a year for the next two years to get its house in order, according to analysts at JP Morgan. After paring back the number of the staff working in each store by some 25%, plans to hire more than 22,000 new employees will cost another \u00a3250m, they calculate. Some retail experts say Tesco's stores are \"too industrial\" and \"lack warmth\". That criticism cannot be levelled at the new London outlet, where the austere red, white and blue aesthetic has been replaced by a cosy green paint job, wooden fittings and hearty pictures of mouthwatering crusty bread and tractors tilling fields. With fresh food a major battleground for the big grocers, initiatives include dedicated \"fruit and veg teams\" clad in special green uniforms to maintain standards and help customers. After years of opening as many stores as planning permission allowed, Clarke is expected to put the brakes on UK expansion. With many households struggling to make ends meet, shoppers are bypassing Tesco's sprawling Extra stores where clothing, DVDs and gadgets tempt them to overspend. Even if he wanted to, Clarke couldn't halt openings overnight, as long planning horizons mean many of this year's stores are already being built. Instead analysts at Nomura predict he will open 15% less space than planned. The January profit warning has unnerved investors, who are unsure where the once rock-solid business is headed. They sat back while Clarke's predecessor, Sir Terry Leahy, used Tesco's Hertfordshire headquarters as a springboard for international expansion and new ventures like financial services, but now worry it has overstretched itself. Last weekend Richard Black, a fund manager at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, Tesco's third-largest shareholder, said it needed \"to think long and hard about what it wants to be\". Other well-known investors have been less vocal. In the wake of the profit alert, US billionaire Warren Buffett upped his stake to more than 5%. Share dealings by Buffett are among the most closely watched in the markets. He argues the financial crisis is creating opportunities in European equities \u2013 Tesco shares have lost 17% over the last three months. While last year's price cut campaign, the Big Price Drop, has become widely known as the Big Price Flop, the most recent sales data from research firm Nielsen suggests Tesco's performance has already begun to improve, with sales up 3.8% in the four weeks to 31 March (albeit far behind Asda, which saw growth of more than 9%). \"In trying to be everything to everyone, Tesco increasingly became nothing to a whole lot of people,\" says Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. \"The [business] is not broken but needs more than a lick of paint to fix.\"",

On one leg of the visit he called for greater co-operation between the British and Indonesian armed forces and defence industries. Defence employs 110,000 people directly in the UK, which is the world's third-largest buyer of defence equipment behind the US and China.

Under the review, the \u00a337bn UK defence budget will be reduced by 8% by 2014, and BAE workers have felt the impact. BAE is cutting 2,000 jobs from its aerospace operations, including 900 at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/sep/27/bae-systems-brough-hawk-warton-david-davis-alan-johnson\" title=\"\">Brough</a> in Yorkshire, while a further 1,500 are under threat at its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/22/bae-jobs-portsmouth-shipbuilding-threat\" title=\"\">Portsmouth shipbuilding</a> operations. <a href=\"http://www.agustawestland.com/\" title=\"\">AgustaWestland</a>, the Italian-owned helicopter maker, is cutting 375 jobs in Britain.</p> <p>In a hall next door to Boardman's office, Typhoons are assembled in a low-key atmosphere of diligent scrutiny that appears to be the signature ambience of advanced manufacturing. The RAF is the main client for the aircraft, although one of the nearly completed models is destined for Saudi Arabia. Explaining the relatively serene environment, a BAE employee says there is no need for riveting if you are putting together a carbon fibre fuselage, which just slots together. Precision is also a prerequisite. The design allows for only 1mm of deviation across the whole aircraft and the alignment of parts is scrutinised by lasers.</p> <p>For BAE, AgustaWestland and other defence manufacturers it is the likes of Saudi Arabia, concerned by the ambitions of Iran and flush with petrodollars to counter them, that will grow in importance as UK spending shrinks. \"There are lots of aircraft here ready for the RAF but if we did just that we would be running out of work in the next couple of years. So we have to be successful elsewhere,\" says Boardman. BAE is hoping to secure a Typhoon order from Oman, as well as a deal to build a maintenance facility in Saudi Arabia \u2013 a major Typhoon customer.</p> <p>But the Typhoon still needs government backing, says Boardman, who explains how all defence manufacturers require the support of their home state. \"You have to have your government promoting you. The best example would be Margaret Thatcher in Saudi Arabia. She made it clear that there had to be a strategic relationship with the kingdom on Saudi Arabia, and from that you get export sales,\" he said, referring to a process that included the controversial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/07/bae15\" title=\"\">al-Yamamah</a> arms deal. It brought BAE more than \u00a340bn of revenue, as well as a Serious Fraud Office investigation that ended abruptly under government orders in 2006.</p> <p>For any defence firm, the domestic market is vital, says Boardman. \"Those nations who are interested in what you have got need to see your government continually investing in that aircraft or ship and its maintenance.\"</p> <p>Boardman is more optimistic than many of his peers, who feel the government is removing support for one of the UK's biggest manufacturing sectors despite calling for a \"march of the makers\" to boost industry.</p> <p>The official defence industry view is gloomy. Robin Southwell, president of ADS, the trade body for the aerospace, defence, security and space industries in the UK, says defence is a \"pretty worried\" sector. \"We are an industry that is flatlining at best,\" he says. The exhortation to export, underlined by George Osborne's call in last month's budget for industry to double exports to \u00a31 trillion by 2020, also concerns him. \"The trouble is, everybody is exporting,\" says Southwell. With manufacturing in economic and political vogue, Southwell argues that defence should be a showcase for industry: \"We are a proven engine room for growth in this nation, we provide a window into Britain's engineering excellence.\"</p> <p>But government support is insufficient, ADS says. The phrase \"off the shelf\" has alarmed British defence firms in recent months. In its white paper on defence procurement published in February, the Ministry of Defence says it will meet the country's defence and security needs through \"open competition in the domestic and global market, buying off the shelf where appropriate\". What this means is that only in exceptional circumstances will British firms receive preferential treatment.</p> <p>Southwell, who is also chief executive of the UK operations at EADS, the European defence and aerospace group, argues that UK defence manufacturers need British government contracts to develop products. Foreign states want to see that UK manufacturers, and their products, are trusted by their domestic government before they buy them. Southwell draws comparisons with the car industry, a powerful exporter in the UK whose domestic market was underpinned by a scrappage scheme during the depths of the recession.</p> <p>\"The car industry is a good example of a joined-up strategy where they have a domestic supply side sorted. Defence does not have a supply-side strategy other than a limited area where there is a direct sovereign capability needed.\" Eight out of 10 cars made in the UK are exported, but for defence manufacturers the domestic market is all-important.</p> <p>\"The difference within our industry is that generally you only have one buyer in the UK. Someone will buy a Toyota Yaris anywhere in the world irrespective of whether someone buys it in the UK. A buyer of a Yaris in Sheffield will have no influence on a buyer in Singapore.\" For defence, it is the opposite, says Southwell. \"If the UK army is not using a piece of [British-made] defence equipment, then the chances of a foreign buyer taking it diminish rapidly.\"</p> <p>Alberto de Benedictis, chief executive of the UK operations of Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland's owner, says the UK defence industry is at a crossroads. \"Its future will very much depend on how the MoD manages its acquisition plans and policy in the coming years. If an off-the-shelf procurement policy became a policy to acquire offshore it would obviously be detrimental to the future of the British defence industry.\"</p> <p>A further glimpse of the future is provided a few miles up the road from Warton, at another BAE site in Samlesbury.

In the past week alone, the bank has endured column-yards of criticism about the \u00a317m pay deal for Bob Diamond \u2013 and perhaps more importantly the move by the high street bank to cough up \u00a35.7m for the chief executive's tax bill.</p> <p>This \"tax equalisation\" \u2013 written into Diamond's contract to make him \"harmless\" for any tax incurred on his move from the US to the UK to become top dog in January 2011 \u2013 is made even more delicious by the bank's long association with tax tales. In February, just days after harping on about the importance of \"citizenship\", Diamond was forced to concede that the bank was at the centre of a tax avoidance clampdown that the Treasury claimed would bring in \u00a3500m.</p> <p>Even the cleverest accountant, it seems, could not get around the fact that the American-born Diamond would be on the hook for two tax bills as a result of being promoted to chief executive after an 18-month period based on Wall Street to oversee the integration of the Lehman Brothers operations the bank acquired during the financial crisis.</p> <p>Barclays \u2013 and its chairman Marcus Agius, who will need every ounce of his famous charm to win over disgruntled City investors \u2013 should now be embarking upon much soul-searching. The tax equalisation could and should have been communicated more effectively. An acknowledgement of this at the annual meeting in a fortnight's time might help appease&#xa0;investors.</p> <p>But the chairman of Barclays' remuneration committee, Alison Carnwath, a respected boardroom grandee, should also be asking whether it would really have been so unacceptable for the well-remunerated chief executive to pay his own tax, if he wanted the job that much.</p> <p>Diamond, who is not short of the odd million or 10, should have considered the impact of the flak that would fly once the size of the tax liability \u2013 which the bank admits is not a one-off \u2013 became apparent.</p> <p>But the shareholders that are apparently now so furious about this \u00a35.7m bill will also need to do some soul-searching of their own. The bank's liability was clearly spelt out in the contract handed to Diamond in January 2011, when he moved back to the UK \u2013 his home for the best part of 20 years until late 2008 \u2013 to become chief executive.</p> <p>From the start, it talked about the agreement to make him \"harmless\" of any tax unfairness he might incur in returning to his adoptive home (he is also a British citizen). It was available for shareholders to read at the time of last year's annual report, let alone before this year's was published. The City employs an army of corporate governance experts to look out for wheezes of this kind, so you would think they might have made a lot of noise about it.</p> <p>Indeed, as ISS, one such corporate governance firm, spells out in its report card on Barclays, the \"significant\" tax liability \"was in accordance with arrangements disclosed to shareholders last year\". One of the most influential advisory agencies, ISS is urging clients to support the remuneration report at the annual meeting, which remains likely to be a tricky affair for the bank.</p> <p>Last year, after some uncomfortable questions from private investors about executive pay, one in 10 of the shareholders who voted failed to endorse the remuneration report. HSBC endured a protest vote of more than twice that size last year.</p> <p>The next two weeks will be crucial. Agius will be relieved if, after supping tea with all those shareholders, he can contain the rebellion to the scale of the one at HSBC. But whatever the scale of the unrest, this looks to be one of those occasions where bad publicity is deserved all round.</p> <h2>Tesco tweeter no more<br></h2> <p>Just before Philip Clarke succeeded Sir Terry Leahy at the top of Tesco last March, he took to Twitter. It was a move the taciturn Leahy would never have made, but seemed specifically designed to show the new boss was a man for the modern era.</p> <p>The regular tweets from @clarkepatesco ranged from something of a global travelogue, detailing his movements around the Tesco empire from Cheshunt to China and \"Whoops. Omaha, Denver, Santa Fe\" (all on one day) to mysterious management insights such as: \"It's all about business building and accelerators\".</p> <p>He provided glimpses of the family man: \"On the way home to meet my favourite cook \u2013 Linda!\" to cutting criticisms of Tesco fare: \"Unfortunately Finest Secret Berry Cheesecake is neither fine nor cheesecake\". There were twitpics of Anfield, and even apologies to his obviously devastated followers when he went an entire 24&#xa0;hours tweet-free.</p> <p>And then, suddenly, @clarkepatesco was history. Over and out on New Year's Eve, 2011. And just when it was getting really interesting. Oh, the insights we have missed \u2026</p> <p>On its first profit warning for two decades in January, he might have tweeted: \"@tescotel Thanks Terry. Legacy intact!! :(\"</p> <p>On the news that top Tesco executive Bob Robbins had sold shares just before the profit warning, pocketing an extra \u00a347,000: \"@bobrobbtesco wtf? Every little helps?\"</p> <p>On the ousting of UK stores boss and long-standing colleague Richard Brasher, which he said was because \"you can't have two captains\": \"@richbrashathome Yours was Costa Concordia, mine's the Titanic.\"</p> <p>On the huge queues now standard in superstores: \"Our new '21 in front' policy is working well &lt;View video&gt;.\"</p> <p>On the continuing loss of market share: \"Shop at Tesco. Pls retweet.\"</p> <p>On the decision to look for a new advertising agency: \"Need new slogan. How about 'Try something new&#xa0;today?'\"</p> <h2>Makers' mark<br></h2> <p>An invitation to the Institute of Directors' annual convention arrives, and with it a stark reminder of how times have changed. When Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp, the IoD was the classic insider pressure group, pushing deregulation, low taxes and liberalisation. But while manufacturers' group the EEF mustered Vince Cable, Ed Miliband and George Osborne to its shindig last month, the headline speakers for the IoD are the maverick Scots leader Alex Salmond and former BP boss Lord Browne, who will also be joined, we're told, by \"a senior cabinet minister,\" as yet unnamed.</p> <p>Manufacturing used to be the Cinderella sector, avoided by ministers dazzled by the world-beating wealth of Britain's bankers. But these days, it's the denizens of boardrooms up and down the land who find themselves neglected by the political classes, who know there are few votes to be won in being seen to snuggle up to fat cats. How times change.</p>",

From the start, it talked about the agreement to make him \"harmless\" of any tax unfairness he might incur in returning to his adoptive home (he is also a British citizen). It was available for shareholders to read at the time of last year's annual report, let alone before this year's was published. The City employs an army of corporate governance experts to look out for wheezes of this kind, so you would think they might have made a lot of noise about it. Indeed, as ISS, one such corporate governance firm, spells out in its report card on Barclays, the \"significant\" tax liability \"was in accordance with arrangements disclosed to shareholders last year\". One of the most influential advisory agencies, ISS is urging clients to support the remuneration report at the annual meeting, which remains likely to be a tricky affair for the bank. Last year, after some uncomfortable questions from private investors about executive pay, one in 10 of the shareholders who voted failed to endorse the remuneration report. HSBC endured a protest vote of more than twice that size last year. The next two weeks will be crucial. Agius will be relieved if, after supping tea with all those shareholders, he can contain the rebellion to the scale of the one at HSBC. But whatever the scale of the unrest, this looks to be one of those occasions where bad publicity is deserved all round. Tesco tweeter no more Just before Philip Clarke succeeded Sir Terry Leahy at the top of Tesco last March, he took to Twitter. It was a move the taciturn Leahy would never have made, but seemed specifically designed to show the new boss was a man for the modern era. The regular tweets from @clarkepatesco ranged from something of a global travelogue, detailing his movements around the Tesco empire from Cheshunt to China and \"Whoops. Omaha, Denver, Santa Fe\" (all on one day) to mysterious management insights such as: \"It's all about business building and accelerators\". He provided glimpses of the family man: \"On the way home to meet my favourite cook \u2013 Linda!\" to cutting criticisms of Tesco fare: \"Unfortunately Finest Secret Berry Cheesecake is neither fine nor cheesecake\". There were twitpics of Anfield, and even apologies to his obviously devastated followers when he went an entire 24 hours tweet-free. And then, suddenly, @clarkepatesco was history. Over and out on New Year's Eve, 2011. And just when it was getting really interesting. Oh, the insights we have missed \u2026 On its first profit warning for two decades in January, he might have tweeted: \"@tescotel Thanks Terry. Legacy intact!! :(\" On the news that top Tesco executive Bob Robbins had sold shares just before the profit warning, pocketing an extra \u00a347,000: \"@bobrobbtesco wtf? Every little helps?\" On the ousting of UK stores boss and long-standing colleague Richard Brasher, which he said was because \"you can't have two captains\": \"@richbrashathome Yours was Costa Concordia, mine's the Titanic.\" On the huge queues now standard in superstores: \"Our new '21 in front' policy is working well  .\" On the continuing loss of market share: \"Shop at Tesco. Pls retweet.\" On the decision to look for a new advertising agency: \"Need new slogan. How about 'Try something new today?'\" Makers' mark An invitation to the Institute of Directors' annual convention arrives, and with it a stark reminder of how times have changed. When Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp, the IoD was the classic insider pressure group, pushing deregulation, low taxes and liberalisation. But while manufacturers' group the EEF mustered Vince Cable, Ed Miliband and George Osborne to its shindig last month, the headline speakers for the IoD are the maverick Scots leader Alex Salmond and former BP boss Lord Browne, who will also be joined, we're told, by \"a senior cabinet minister,\" as yet unnamed. Manufacturing used to be the Cinderella sector, avoided by ministers dazzled by the world-beating wealth of Britain's bankers. But these days, it's the denizens of boardrooms up and down the land who find themselves neglected by the political classes, who know there are few votes to be won in being seen to snuggle up to fat cats. How times change.",
