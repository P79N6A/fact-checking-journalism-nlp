      "bodyText": "Salt levels in pesto sauces on sale in supermarkets remain higher than suggested limits and have increased in some cases, despite a government health campaign to reduce them, a survey has found. Two products made by Sacla, the UK\u2019s bestselling pesto brand, have 30% more salt than seawater and two and a half times as much salt per 100g as peanuts, according to research by Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash). Sacla\u2019s No 1 Classic Basil Pesto has 18% more salt than when it was last surveyed in 2009, while its No 5 Organic Basil Pesto has 32% more than previously. Both contain more than 1.5g of salt per serving, more than a McDonald\u2019s hamburger, and 3.3g of salt per 100g. For pesto and other thick sauces, the average salt target is 1.38g per 100g, but nearly 40% of products exceed this. Cash is calling on Public Health England (PHE) to be tougher on the food industry because it is concerned that with fewer than three months of 2017 remaining, some manufacturers are failing to meet the Department of Health\u2019s salt reduction targets for a wide range of foods. The health group collected and analysed nutritional data for 75 pesto sauces on sale in major supermarkets in June and July. Among the other brands, Napolina Green Pesto with Basil, Gino D\u2019Acampo Pesto alla Genovese Basil Pesto and Truly Italian Genovese Basil Pesto contained between 2g and 2.5g of salt per 100g. Tesco Reduced Fat Red Pesto, Aldi\u2019s Specially Selected Italian Pesto Genovese and Specially Selected Pesto Rosso, Jamie Oliver Green Pesto and Sainsbury\u2019s Taste The Difference Pesto Alla Genovese fared better, with less than 1g of salt per 100g. Pesto is a convenient addition to pasta and popular with children, making it a bigger contributor to their maximum recommended daily salt intake, which is much lower for children than adults. In the long term, consuming more than is recommended could increase a child\u2019s risk of developing high blood pressure, strokes and heart attacks later in life. According to the NHS, the maximum daily recommended amount of salt children should eat is 2g for one to three-year-olds, 3g for four to six-year-olds and 5g for seven to 10-year-olds. Adults should eat no more than 6g of salt per day. Graham MacGregor, the Cash chairman and a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, said: \u201cThe UK was leading the world in salt reduction, but so far, PHE is doing little to ensure that the 2017 salt targets are met, and has not confirmed that they are setting new targets to be achieved by 2020.\u201d Pesto is also high in saturated fat, further increasing the risk of heart disease. People are being encouraged to make their own using a simple and easy recipe, which can be stored in the fridge for up to seven days. A Sacla spokesperaon said: \u201cWe work hard to make authentic Italian products which are good quality, safe to eat and should be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.\u201d PHE\u2019s chief nutritionist, Dr Alison Tedstone, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear with the food industry on the importance of reducing salt and meeting the 2017 salt targets. \u201cAlthough consumption has reduced by 11%, industry cannot be complacent and PHE will report on their progress next year.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "IMF warns that using consumer debt to fuel growth risks crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has issued a warning to governments that rely on debt-fuelled consumer spending to boost economic growth, telling them they run the risk of another major financial collapse. In a report before the IMF\u2019s annual meeting in Washington next week, it said analysis of consumer spending and levels of household debt showed that economies benefited in the first two to three years when households raised their levels of borrowing, but then risks began to mount. Once growth becomes dependent on household debt, it can be a matter of two to three years before a financial crash, the IMF said in its annual report on the global financial system. The study follows a series of warnings about rising levels of household debt in the UK from financial regulators and debt charities. In a blogpost accompanying the report, one of the authors, Nico Valckx, warned: \u201cDebt greases the wheels of the economy. It allows individuals to make big investments today \u2013 like buying a house or going to college \u2013 by pledging some of their future earnings. That\u2019s all fine in theory. But as the global financial crisis showed, rapid growth in household debt \u2013 especially mortgages \u2013 can be dangerous.\u201d He added: \u201cHigher debt is associated with significantly higher unemployment up to four years ahead. And a one percentage point increase in debt raises the odds of a future banking crisis by about one percentage point. That\u2019s a significant increase, when you consider that the probability of a crisis is 3.5%, even without any increase in debt.\u201d Earlier this year the IMF cut its forecast for the UK\u2019s GDP growth in 2017 by 0.3 percentage points to 1.7% and it is expected to reduce its prediction further next week when its global outlook is published. The uncertainty created by the Brexit vote and negotiations to leave are likely to be blamed, along with a reliance on consumer spending, which has slowed this year. The Bank of England, which regulates the banking sector, said last month that the UK\u2019s banks could incur \u00a330bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance if interest rates and unemployment rose sharply. The debt charity Stepchange has warned that 6.5 million people have used credit to pay for basic items such as food after a change in their circumstances. And MPs have called for an independent commission to examine the effects of rising household debt levels in the UK. Household debt levels fell in relation to the UK\u2019s national income (GDP) immediately following the 2008 crash from a peak of almost 170% to below 140%. But in the last two years the figure has begun to creep upwards, fuelling concerns that the UK\u2019s GDP growth is already dependent on consumer borrowing. Valckx said countries with high levels of debt were able to reduce the risks by introducing strict limits on levels of borrowing and tight regulations on the banking sector. \u201cCountries can mitigate the risks by taking measures that moderate the growth of household debt, such as raising the down payment required to purchase a house or the fraction of a household income that can be devoted to debt repayments,\u201d he said. Most of the risk relates to the mortgage market, which is 10 times the size of the consumer debt market in the US and the UK. In the UK, the level of mortgage debt relative to GDP has remained stable since 2008. However, the number of borrowers has become smaller as large numbers of older homeowners pay off their mortgages and high property prices limit the number of first-time buyers entering the market.",

The Indian government accuses Mallya, 61, of fleeing to the UK to avoid arrest in relation to \u00a31bn of unpaid debts.

If it is my lawful duty to be here, I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d Mallya was first arrested in April following the Indian\u2019s government request for his extradition to stand trail over an alleged debt of 94bn rupees (\u00a31bn) owed to state-owned banks after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines in 2012. The businessman, who is living in a \u00a311.5m Hertfordshire mansion once owned by the father of F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, is due back in court on 20 November and an extradition hearing is due to start on 4 December. Mallya was once known as the \u201cBranson of Bangalore\u201d for his business and sport empire which included beer, spirits and an airline. But he has fallen from a billionaire playboy, known for his beer company Kingfisher\u2019s take on the Pirelli calendar and for hosting celebrity parties on his 311ft superyacht Indian Empress during the Monte Carlo Grand Prix, to facing extradition from the UK. Mallya has been spotted being driven by a chauffeur around London in a silver Maybach bearing the initials VJM on its number plate. His private Airbus A319 jet had the initials painted in gold on the engines and wingtips until it was put up for auction. More than 4,000 Kingfisher Airlines employees went without pay for seven months before they revolted and grounded the carrier in October 2012.",

      "bodyText": "The 2 Sisters Food Group has admitted it has found \u201cother areas of concern\u201d, centred on food hygiene standards, at its scandal-hit West Bromwich chicken processing plant, which was shut down at the weekend. The country\u2019s largest supplier of supermarket chicken suspended production at one of its main processing plants on Sunday in the wake of a Guardian and ITV News investigation that revealed poor hygiene standards and food safety records being altered. In a conference call with investors on Tuesday, company executives said that the closure would cost the company up to \u00a3500,000 a week, but that it will be using the incident as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d and would be retraining staff across its business. The investment banks on the call included some of the largest in the world, such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Barclays. Martyn Fletcher, chief operating officer at 2 Sisters, said: \u201cWe do not believe that we have got any major compliance issues in our organisation. It\u2019s isolated to this particular video footage and we have, in investigating the site, found some other areas of concern at that site. \u201cWe will be using the incident as a wake-up call and will be rolling out those learnings and retraining [staff] right across the estate.\u201d The food group said the problems related to food hygiene rather than regulatory breaches at the factory. On Thursday last week the Guardian and ITV released undercover footage showing an instance of 2 Sisters workers altering the source and slaughter date of poultry being processed in the firm\u2019s Site D plant in West Bromwich. Experts said altering \u201ckill dates\u201d could artificially stretch the commercial life of the meat and dupe consumers into buying chicken past its use-by date. It is illegal to place incorrect use-by dates on food, which are set for safety reasons and differ from \u201cbest before\u201d dates. The company told investors there was \u201cno evidence of any such breach in that regard\u201d. Other sections of the footage, which was filmed in August, showed chicken being picked off the floor and thrown back on to the production line, and older poultry being mixed with fresher birds. On Friday Marks &amp; Spencer, Aldi and Lidl all announced they had suspended deliveries from the 2 Sisters plant, while Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco followed suit over the weekend. M&amp;S said the footage showed \u201cunacceptable\u201d standards and also pulled chicken sourced from the plant from its shelves. The Food Standards Agency \u2013 which had conducted nine audits at the site, five of which were unannounced, in the months of July and August \u2013 also announced its own investigation. It has not found any breaches and has urged \u201canyone with information for this investigation\u201d to make contact. On its call to investors, 2 Sisters said that the undercover footage showing removal of the kill dates from the boxes was allowed as \u201cwe are not changing any dates, we are applying the correct dates\u201d. Quality assurance staff at 2 Sisters, who were shown evidence of the kill date switch prior to publication, described to the Guardian and ITV how the episode was \u201ctotally wrong\u201d and that they would prevent the meat from hitting the production line if they had witnessed it. Their views were mirrored by four government meat inspectors, who were also shown the evidence. One investor on the conference call asked 2 Sisters: \u201cBack in 2014 [when there were separate allegations that a worker had picked chicken off the floor and returned it to the production line] you did not close the site. But today you are closing the site. So my question is: how bad is this versus just \u2018meat off the floor\u2019?\u201d The company did not answer that question specifically, but finance chief Richard Pike reiterated: \u201cThere have been no breaches of food safety regulations.\u201d The 2 Sisters Food Group is the UK\u2019s second largest food company by turnover and claims to process about 6m chickens every week. It is owned by Ranjit Singh Boparan and his wife, Baljinder Kaur Boparan, and the chicken operations \u2013 which include 12 sites in the UK \u2013 are part of a sprawling \u00a33bn food empire that separately includes the turkey producer Bernard Matthews, the restaurant chains Harry Ramsden, FishWorks and Giraffe, plus food brands such as Fox\u2019s Biscuits and Goodfella\u2019s pizza. Neither Ranjit nor Bajinder Boparan were on the investor call.",

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail looks set to deliver a long and bitter dispute | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Vince Cable, business secretary in the coalition government, was right about Royal Mail being a risky investment at privatisation in 2013. The biggest risk \u2013 industrial action \u2013 is now arriving and looks serious. Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) have voted overwhelmingly to strike over the company\u2019s proposal to cut pension benefits. The City had anticipated the outcome and the shares closed on Tuesday at 384p, down 17% this year and not far above the float price of 330p. The heady post-flotation days of 600p feel like another age. The alarming part of this dispute is that Royal Mail\u2019s room for manoeuvre looks to be limited. While the state guaranteed the pre-privatisation pension liabilities, the cost of the post-privatisation defined-benefit scheme has been deemed unaffordable after next March. That assessment looks correct, sadly. Royal Mail estimates its annual contributions would more than double from the current \u00a3400m to as much as \u00a31bn. At a business generating \u00a3420m of free cash flow, something has to give. The dispute, then, is about what replaces the current arrangements. Royal Mail has made three offers with the aim of keeping contributions at about \u00a3400m. All have been rejected. The last proposal involves offering the 88,000 members of the defined-benefit scheme either a \u201ccash balance scheme\u201d that pays a guaranteed lump sum on retirement or the opportunity to join a conventional contribution scheme. Yet it is also hard to see how CWU\u2019s alternative idea (which also covers defined-contribution members) can be spun into a form Royal Mail\u2019s management could accept. First, the annual cash cost would be about \u00a3500m, according to analysts at Jefferies. Second, the structure looks too risky from the point of the view of the sponsor: it too closely resembles a defined-benefit scheme with a heavy exposure to shares and thus volatility. A negotiating gap of \u00a3100m a year \u2013 plus a disagreement over structure \u2013 is enormous, as are the stakes on both sides. The proposed cuts in retirement income for workers would be substantial in many cases \u2013 up to a third, says the CWU. Yet Royal Mail management, with pressures on revenue from all sides, can\u2019t stray far from its definition of a \u201cmanageable\u201d pension cost. Royal Mail has not had a strike since 2009 and the postal climate is different these days. Amazon delivers one in 10 parcels in the UK and the gig economy, where they don\u2019t do pensions like Royal Mail\u2019s, creeps closer. In the meantime, letters volumes continue to fall. An optimist might say a settlement is bound to emerge precisely because the stakes are so high. Well, yes, in time \u2013 but a thumping 89% majority in Tuesday\u2019s CWU ballot on a big turnout, and talk of renationalisation in the air, makes the plot difficult to predict. The first skirmish will be over the timing of any strike, with the company desperate to avoid Christmas. It says the CWU, under an agreement from 2013, is obliged to go to external mediation, which could take until \u201cclose to Christmas to be completed, and may be longer.\u201d This dispute could become very long and bitter. Royal Mail has fallen out of the FTSE 100 index. Prospects for a quick return are poor. Fidelity should spell out how it will pay for performance Now that the giant BlackRock is driving its passively-managed juggernaut across the investment landscape, active fund managers are obliged to contemplate their role in life. Some, like Aberdeen and Standard Life, are combining in search of cost savings and smarter technology to combat the appeal of cheap tracker funds. Here\u2019s a different solution from Fidelity, the \u00a3233bn investment house: it will charge investors less when its funds underperform their benchmarks, and charge more when they do. It\u2019s not an original idea since it is borrowed from the land of hedge funds. But, for a mainstream manager with a big retail following, it\u2019s fresh. Fidelity calls the sliding scale a \u201cfulcrum fee\u201d and one can understand the logic \u2013 it feels clean to pay active fund managers by results. There\u2019s just one problem: Fidelity didn\u2019t bother to say what the base and success fees under this new model will be. The details for all 400 funds are still being worked out, it says. In that case, don\u2019t talk about \u201ca significant announcement\u201d. The punters want to know what they\u2019ll be paying. Until you tell them, it\u2019s impossible to judge if this is a revolutionary moment for the industry, or just window dressing. Ryanair row gives tax probe new wings Michael O\u2019Leary will be satisfied. Despite the chaos of cancelled flights, Ryanair carried 11.8 million passengers in September, up 10% on a year ago. So far, so good. But here is one way in which the cancelled flights may cause complications: more people want to know about your business model. As the Guardian reported today (Tuesday 3 October), Ryanair pilots are being investigated by HM Revenue &amp; Customs over their complex employment structures. HMRC\u2019s inquiries, it should be said, started a couple of years ago. But the taxman\u2019s desire to know everything about the contracts will only be deepened after the events of the past few weeks.",

But, for a mainstream manager with a big retail following, it\u2019s fresh. Fidelity calls the sliding scale a \u201cfulcrum fee\u201d and one can understand the logic \u2013 it feels clean to pay active fund managers by results.</p> <p>There\u2019s just one problem: Fidelity didn\u2019t bother to say what the base and success fees under this new model will be. The details for all 400 funds are still being worked out, it says.<br></p> <p>In that case, don\u2019t talk about \u201ca significant announcement\u201d.

      "bodyText": "With Wall Street hitting new highs and Spanish shares recovering from their falls following the weekend\u2019s violence at the Catalan independence vote, European markets managed to gain some ground, albeit a limited amount. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 29.27 points or 0.39% at 7468.11, helped by a weaker pound in the wake of disappointing construction figures France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.32% at 5367.41 Germany\u2019s Dax was closed for the Unity day holiday Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.02% at 10,257.5 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB slipped 0.12% to 22,784.82 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.8% to 752.44 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 69 points or 0.31%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Some breaking UK news, and the Royal Mail is facing a strike threat, its first since it was privatised. Workers voted emphatically in favour of industrial action over pensions, pay and jobs. The Press Association reports: Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) backed walkouts by 89% on a turnout of 73% of the 110,000 balloted. It passed the threshold in the Government\u2019s controversial Trade Union Act, under which ballots need a 50% turnout for industrial action to go ahead. The CWU believes it is a \u201cwatershed\u201d moment for unions as well as the Royal Mail, which it has accused of following a \u201crelentless\u201d programme of cost-cutting to maximise short-term profits and shareholder returns. The union accused the company of \u201cunilaterally\u201d closing its defined benefit, or final salary, pension scheme, with new entrants going into an \u201cinferior\u201d scheme which will leave them in \u201cpensioner poverty\u201d. The union is also in dispute over pay and issues such as delivery office closures... The CWU Postal Executive will meet later this week to determine the next steps in this campaign and any potential strike dates. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, is also contemplating a weaker pound: The Dow has punched to new all-time highs today, as the optimism sparked by last week\u2019s Trump tax plans continue to drive outperformance in US markets. On a day devoid of any major economic data points from the eurozone and US, the focus has been on the UK in the wake of this morning\u2019s construction PMI which plummeted into contraction territory. With London house prices shrinking, and business confidence suffering, it comes as no surprise that completed construction jobs are failing to be replaced with new orders as investment dries up. Tomorrow\u2019s services PMI should give us a good idea of how the fourth quarter could shape up, and if the manufacturing and construction readings are anything to go by, we are likely to see further deterioration in both economic data, and in turn, the pound. As Wall Street hits new highs, the UK market is edging higher, mainly due to weakness in the pound. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says sterling weakness could continue: Despite having little to push it higher beyond its own momentum, a 50 point rise saw the Dow cross 22600 for the first time in its history. The FTSE, on the other hand, was at a rather less impressive on month high, climbing past 7450 \u2013 a repeated ceiling for the index in the past couple of months \u2013 thanks to a sterling-inspired 0.4% increase. Talking of the pound, its miserable, manufacturing and construction PMI-dampened start to October continued this Tuesday. Cable fell 0.2%, taking sterling below $1.327 for the first time in almost 3 weeks. Against the euro the currency\u2019s losses were even greater, the pound dropping 0.4% to a 2 week, sub \u20ac1.127 nadir after the European Parliament claimed that \u2018sufficient progress has not yet been made\u2019 on the EU divorce bill, preventing progress to the next round of negotiations. Whether or not the pound can find a tourniquet for its losses may be dependent on Wednesday\u2019s services PMI. Analysts are expecting the figure to nudge higher, from 53.2 in August to 53.3 in September; however, as we have seen twice already this week, those estimates have a tendency to be off the mark. If the services sector \u2013 the main fuel for the UK\u2019s growth \u2013 shows the same signs of slowdown as the manufacturing and construction PMIs, then the pound may be in line for another pummelling. Some disappointing data from the US. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s current business conditions index for New York fell to 49.7 in September, down from 56.6 in August. A reading below 50 signals contraction. And if you think you\u2019ve heard the words \u201crecord US stock market highs\u201d many times before in the past few months, well, you have: DING DING! The US stock market has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading in New York. Today\u2019s report also highlights how Canada has gone on a household debt spree since the financial crisis, while American families have managed to cut their borrowing burden. Canada\u2019s economy has posted sparkling growth earlier this year, while house prices have also soared. If the IMF are right, there could be a reckoning at some stage.... The IMF also warns that the least wealthy are being dragged deeper into debt, and will suffer the most if there is an economic crisis. Today\u2019s report says: Lower-income groups tend to be more vulnerable. Household surveys confirm that, within countries, the share of lower-income households in total debt has grown. These households typically have higher debt-to-income, higher debt-service-to-income, and higher debt-to-assets ratios, which makes them more vulnerable to adverse shocks than higher-income households. This chart shows how a build-up of household debt can create a vicious circle: As you can see....once banks cut back on lending, asset prices fall, households default on their debt, hitting bank capital reserves, leading them to cut back on their lending etc etc. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has warned that the rise in consumer debt risks destabilising the global economy. In a new report, the IMF flags up that increased borrowing can stimulate short-term growth, but it also creates financial instability. The Fund says: On average, an increase in household debt boosts growth in the short term but may give rise to macroeconomic and financial stability risks in the medium term. Real GDP initially reacts positively to increases in household debt, as do consumption, employment, and house and bank equity prices. However, after one or two years, the dynamic relationship between debt, GDP, consumption, employment, housing, and bank equity prices turns negative. Higher household debt is associated with a greater probability of a banking crisis, especially when debt is already high, and with greater risk of declines in bank equity prices. The warning comes in the analytical chapters of the Fund\u2019s Global Financial Stability Report, which have just been published. In an accompanying blog post, senior IMF Nico Valckx spells out that increasing the ratio of household debt actually leads to lower growth, over say five years. The effect is particularly stark for advanced economies, as this chart shows: Valckz says that debt \u201cgreases the wheels of the economy\u201d, letting people make an important big purchase and finance it over time. But too much grease ends up bunging the wheels of growth, he explains: At first, households take on more debt to buy things like new homes and cars. That gives the economy a short-term boost as automakers and home builders hire more workers. But later, highly indebted households may need to cut back on spending to repay their loans. That\u2019s a drag on growth. And as the 2008 crisis demonstrated, a sudden economic shock \u2013 such as a decline in home prices \u2013 can trigger a spiral of credit defaults that shakes the foundations of the financial system. More here: UK readers will be well aware that the cost of living in Britain has risen sharply in the last year, following the slump in the pound after the EU referendum. Now, a new report has highlighted that inflation in the UK is outpacing other advanced nations, including Germany, the US and France. My colleague Richard Partington explains: The UK has the highest inflation rate among the world\u2019s top economies, in the latest sign the Brexit vote is contributing to a squeeze on living standards. The increased cost of importing food and fuel is pushing prices to rise at a faster rate than anywhere in the G7 group of leading global economies, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The UK is only behind Turkey, Mexico and the eastern European states of Latvia and Estonia in the club of 35 developed nations. The annual growth in prices in the UK jumped to 2.9% in August from 2.6% in July, equalling a four-year high in the consumer price index (CPI) reached in May earlier this year. That outstrips the average 2.2% growth in prices across the OECD for the same month. Britain\u2019s construction woes haven\u2019t dampened the mood in the financial markets. World stock markets remain at record highs today, following last night\u2019s rally on Wall Street. In London, the FTSE 100 has hit a one-month high, up 9 points at 7448. Big exporters are benefitting from the drop in the pound this morning. Hundreds of workers in Norwich face an uncertain future after drinks company Britvic announced plans to shut its factory in the city. The group is planning to move production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot drinks from the Norwich factory to sites in east London, Leeds and Rugby by 2019. The 242 people who work there will be offered \u201credeployment opportunities at other sites\u201d, says Britvic, or support to find a new job elsewhere. The site is co-owned with consumer goods giant Unilever, which makes Coleman\u2019s Mustard there. Unilever says it is now reviewing its own options; that could mean that production of the fiery condiment ends after two hundred years. Local MPs and business leaders are rallying around, according to the local Eastern Daily Press. Labour\u2019s Clive Lewis tweets: Chloe Smith, MP for Norwich North, says: \u201cThis is very sad news and many constituents will be very anxious about this possible closure. At this stage, I am urging the company to make every support available to those workers.\u201d David Montague, chief executive of London housing association L&amp;Q, is urging the government to help British construction and provide some Brexit certainty. He fears that building firms will struggle badly if they lose access to workers from overseas. \u201cToday\u2019s figures are worrying for the construction sector and at a time when more housebuilding is needed than ever before. \u201cWe need assurance that an appropriate immigration policy will keep the doors open to skilled overseas talent and that there will suitable investment in training at home. Without this, the figures we are seeing today - will undoubtedly worsen. \u201cL&amp;Q and many others in the sector have skilled workforces, strong partnerships, access to land and the financial strength to deliver very ambitious plans. What we need now is political and economic certainty.\u201d Britain\u2019s builders aren\u2019t the only people worrying about Brexit. The Bank of England has flagged up another concern this morning; that UK businesses could struggle to borrow after Britain leaves the EU. That\u2019s because European banks who currently operate branches in Britain may have to upgrade to fully fledged subsidiaries after Brexit. If they don\u2019t, they might not be allowed to operate. That would cut the amount of lending offer, the BoE fears. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: Companies from European Economic Area countries \u2013 EU member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway \u2013 provide about 10% of lending to UK businesses and would need to reapply for authorisation to operate in Britain after it leaves the EU. In its latest update on potential risks to financial stability, the Bank of England said: \u201cThe risk of disruption to wholesale UK banking services appeared to be slightly higher than previously thought, given that a number of EEA firms branching into the UK were not sufficiently focused on addressing this issue. More here: Richard Threlfall, head of infrastructure, building and construction at KPMG has a very gloomy take on today\u2019s construction PMI: \u201cThis reading is significantly worse than expected and shows that economic uncertainty continues to have a serious impact on the construction industry. Construction is an economic bellwether, so the concern will spread well beyond the sector. \u201cThere is a clear downturn in commercial construction, which is likely to continue. This is because new orders are dropping off, hitting pipelines. Infrastructure output also appears to be in decline and contractors will be concerned about a lack of new projects. \u201cThe one relative bright spot in the data was housebuilding, but even this lost momentum and there are fears that demand will drop off if interest rates rise.\u201d The pound has dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar in over two weeks, down 0.2% at $1.325. Sterling has also shed 0.3% against the euro, to \u20ac1.128. The fall in UK construction activity last month has come as a nasty shock to the City. Traders are concerned that the British economy may be weakening, in the face of Brexit worries and tensions at the heart of the UK government. Earlier today, a senior German MEP actually urged Theresa May to sack foreign secretary Boris Johnson following his comments about Brexit. Manuel Ortiz-Olave, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, says this political tension is not good for sterling. \u201cToday UK construction sector survey data fell into negative territory for the first time in more than a year. The data comes at a terrible time considering how poorly the latest rounds of macro data have performed, and also now that a potential political crisis is brewing in the Tory party. A combination of last Friday\u2019s downward revisions of GDP data, the increase in trade deficit and consumer debt, coupled with yesterday\u2019s poor manufacturing survey data are now followed by construction pessimism across the board. Today\u2019s PMI report also shows that British builders are suffering from the weak pound. Input cost inflation hit a seven-month high in September, meaning construction firms were forced to pay more for raw materials. Jason Robinson of trade credit insurer Euler Hermes fears that British building companies could suffer a \u201cdomino effect\u201d of failures in the months ahead. \u201cAccess to skilled labour is among the chief concerns within the construction industry. Without clarity on Brexit negotiations and in particularly EU workers\u2019 rights, uncertainty will weigh on contractors\u2019 pipelines because of the lack of concrete details over the future economic landscape. \u201cWhile the performance of housebuilders has been positive in 2017, an increase in failures across construction appears unavoidable as contracts become more difficult to get over the line and tendering becomes keener. High profile profit warnings continue as legacy contracts take their toll on margins.\u201d \u201cPayment delays from large contractors could have a significant impact down the supply chain, and firms will need to be vigilant to avoid being caught in a \u2018domino effect\u2019 of failures.\u201d Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says the government could help the building sector. \u201cIn infrastructure, contractors are hoping for further positive news in November\u2019s Budget following this week\u2019s announcement of more funding for the north of England\u2019s rail network. Despite uncertainty, the UK is still on the whole viewed by overseas funders as a good place in which to invest their capital. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, agrees that Brexit is hurting builders: \u201cThis contraction in the construction sector wasn\u2019t welcomed by the market, and certainly won\u2019t be welcomed by the Brexit negotiating team and those at the Conservative Party conference. Brexit uncertainty has returned to the fore and is back to weighing down on sterling, as a weak pound increases the cost of imported materials. The fall in commercial construction activity last month suggests companies are stopping investing in new shops, offices and factories. That\u2019s a worrying sign for economic growth, says Chris Williamson of Markit. The tumble in the UK construction PMI last month shows that anxiety over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is hitting the economy. So argues Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. Brock said: \u201cA dismal picture of construction emerged this month as the sector showed signs of worsening business conditions across the board. With the biggest contraction in overall activity since July 2016, and a drop in new orders, optimism was in short supply. \u201cRespondents pointed to obstructive economic conditions and the Brexit blight of uncertainty, freezing clients into indecision over new projects. Even housing, the stalwart of the construction sector stuttered with a dwindling performance, but civil engineering was the biggest victim falling to its weakest level for four and a half years. UK housebuilding growth slowed to a six-month low, while civil engineering and construction both shrank in September. Tim Moore of Markit, who produced today\u2019s report, explains why activity hit a 14-month low of 48.1 last month: Commercial development has been the worst performing category in recent months. Construction firms attributed falling volumes of commercial work to subdued business investment and reduced risk appetite among clients, linked to heightened economic and political uncertainty. \u201cCivil engineering work decreased at its fastest pace since April 2013, which prompted concerns from survey respondents about a near-term lack of new infrastructure projects. \u201cHouse building slipped down a gear in September, which highlighted that fragile confidence has spread across all three key market segments. Some firms suggested that the loss of momentum for residential construction reflected worries about the outlook for ultra-low mortgage rates and less upbeat demand expectations.\u201d Breaking! Britain\u2019s construction sector is contracting, fuelling fears that the UK economy is slowing. The Markit construction PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, fell to just 48.1 in September. That\u2019s down from 51.1 in August. Crucially, it is below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. In other words, activity across the building sector is shrinking, for the first time in 13 months (just after the Brexit vote). This is much worse than anyone in the City expected (economists predicted a reading of around 50.0) Builders interviewed by Markit say they suffered a drop in workloads due to \u201cfragile confidence and subdued risk appetite\u201d among clients, especially in the commercial building sector. Brexit uncertainty appears to be a big factor. Markit says: Survey respondents widely commented on a headwind from political and economic uncertainty, alongside extended lead times for budget approvals among clients More to follow.... Greggs is hoping that a new \u2018all day breakfast\u2019 wrap, and a Thai chicken soup offering, will lure customers into its shops this autumn. The bakers chain reports that its breakfast sales have \u201cgrown strongly\u201d in the last three months, helping total takings to rise by 8.6%. Gregs is also cracking on with its expansion programme; planning to open up to 150 stores this year, and close 50. It\u2019s already opened 98 since the start of January. Shares have risen by 1% so far today. Shares are nudging higher in Europe, with the Stoxx 600 index up 0.1%. Spanish shares are also up slightly, following yesterday\u2019s selloff after the Catalan referendum. In London, the FTSE 100 is flat. Ferguson is leading the risers, though, up 3.6% after announcing a \u00a3500m share buyback alongside a sharp rise in profits. Ferguson (previously called Wolseley) has been benefitting from a tighter focus on the US housing market. World stock markets have hit a new peak, following yesterday\u2019s rally on Wall Street. The MSCI All-Country World Share Index has nudged 488.33 points, indicating that equities have never been more expensive. This rally was led by America, where the New York stock market hit fresh record highs last night. The Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices all began October with new gains. Investors were cheered by the news that US factory growth hit a 13-year high last month, indicating that the US economy is expanding at a solid pace. Investors are also clinging to optimism that Donald Trump might push some growth-friendly measures though, as Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, explained (via CNBC): The economy is doing well despite the storms. A lot of folks don\u2019t think there will be tax reform but the market thinks there will be. If that happens, it will be a big boost to the economy.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ll be taking the health of the UK building sector this morning, when Markit releases its latest Construction PMI report, for September. Britain\u2019s builders aren\u2019t having a great time right now, with Brexit uncertainty deterring some clients from committing to new projects. In August, the construction PMI fell to a one-year low of 51.1 (50 = stagnation). And there are fears that growth hasn\u2019t picked up yet. The City consensus is that September\u2019s construction PMI dipped, to 51.0. Anything lower than that would indicate that builders are struggling. That would be a concern, after Monday\u2019s manufacturing PMI showed a factory slowdown. Royal Bank of Canada expect a weak construction report.... Our expectation is for a dip to 50.3 from 51.1 which would come on the back of an undershoot of expectations in the manufacturing PMI yesterday. However, what really matters is tomorrow\u2019s services PMI as that will give us more of a sense of where the risks lie with our 0.2% q/q growth forecast for Q3. We\u2019ll also be tracking the latest development around Monarch Airlines, following its collapse yesterday. Uber could also be in the news; its chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has flown to London for talks with the transport authority over the loss of its licence in the capital. Plus, we have results from baking firm Greggs (which has posted a 5% rise in like-for-like sales this summer), and heating supply firm Ferguson (whose profits are up 25% over the last year). Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI report for September. 9.30am BST: Bank of England releases the record of last month\u2019s Financial Policy Committee meeting 10am BST: Eurozone producer prices figures for August. 2pm BST: IMF releases the Analytical Chapters of the October 2017 Global Financial Stability Report",

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says sterling weakness could continue:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite having little to push it higher beyond its own momentum, a 50 point rise saw the Dow cross 22600 for the first time in its history. The FTSE, on the other hand, was at a rather less impressive on month high, climbing past 7450 \u2013 a repeated ceiling for the index in the past couple of months \u2013 thanks to a sterling-inspired 0.4% increase.</p> <p>Talking of the pound, its miserable, manufacturing and construction PMI-dampened start to October continued this Tuesday. Cable fell 0.2%, taking sterling below $1.327 for the first time in almost 3 weeks. Against the euro the currency\u2019s losses were even greater, the pound dropping 0.4% to a 2 week, sub \u20ac1.127 nadir after the European Parliament claimed that \u2018sufficient progress has not yet been made\u2019 on the EU divorce bill, preventing progress to the next round of negotiations.</p> <p>Whether or not the pound can find a tourniquet for its losses may be dependent on Wednesday\u2019s services PMI. Analysts are expecting the figure to nudge higher, from 53.2 in August to 53.3 in September; however, as we have seen twice already this week, those estimates have a tendency to be off the mark. If the services sector \u2013 the main fuel for the UK\u2019s growth \u2013 shows the same signs of slowdown as the manufacturing and construction PMIs, then the pound may be in line for another pummelling.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59d39cd3e4b0563a9b0f8e97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-03T14:22:50.882Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some disappointing data from the US.</p> <p>The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s current business conditions index for New York fell to 49.7 in September, down from 56.6 in August.

Real GDP initially reacts positively to increases in household debt, as do consumption, employment, and house and bank equity prices.</p> <p>However, after one or two years, the dynamic relationship between debt, GDP, consumption, employment, housing, and bank equity prices turns negative. Higher household debt is associated with a greater probability of a banking crisis, especially when debt is already high, and with greater risk of declines in bank equity prices.</p> </blockquote> <p>The warning comes in the analytical chapters of the Fund\u2019s Global Financial Stability Report, which have just been published.</p> <p>In an accompanying blog post, senior IMF Nico Valckx spells out that increasing the ratio of household debt actually leads to <strong>lower</strong> growth, over say five years.

But too much grease ends up bunging the wheels of growth, he explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> At first, households take on more debt to buy things like new homes and cars. That gives the economy a short-term boost as automakers and home builders hire more workers. But later, highly indebted households may need to cut back on spending to repay their loans. That\u2019s a drag on growth.</p> <p> And as the 2008 crisis demonstrated, a sudden economic shock \u2013 such as a decline in home prices \u2013 can trigger a spiral of credit defaults that shakes the foundations of the financial system.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/915202490123132929\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IMF warns that using consumer debt to fuel growth risks crisis <a href=\"https://t.co/mAd3HcfMuu\">https://t.co/mAd3HcfMuu</a></p>&mdash; The Guardian (@guardian) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/915202490123132929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-10-03T13:50:53.467Z\">at 2.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59d38abee4b0563a9b0f8e39\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-03T13:08:14.108Z\">2.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>UK readers will be well aware that the cost of living in Britain has risen sharply in the last year, following the slump in the pound after the EU referendum.</strong></p> <p>Now, a new report has highlighted that inflation in the UK is outpacing other advanced nations, including Germany, the US and France.</p> <p>My colleague Richard Partington explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK has the highest inflation rate among the world\u2019s top economies, in the latest sign the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> vote is contributing to a squeeze on living standards.</p> <p>The increased cost of importing food and fuel is pushing prices to rise at a faster rate than anywhere in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7\">G7</a> group of leading global economies, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Postal workers are on the verge of a strike in a dispute over pensions, pay and conditions. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) announced on Tuesday that a majority of its 111,000 members in Royal Mail had voted for industrial action, the first since the company was privatised four years ago. The union said 73.7% of its members had turned out to vote, with 89% of them backing a walkout. Its executive will meet this week to determine any potential strike dates, which are likely to come before the end of the year. Some reports suggested that they could be timed to coincide with the so-called \u201cBlack Friday\u201d sales on November 24 and 25, when many people do their Christmas shopping online. The vote was a major test for the union after the introduction of the government\u2019s controversial Trade Union Act, which requires strike ballots to have a 50% turnout. It comes amid a flurry of union activity this autumn as public sector and health workers discuss the possibilities of industrial action. Dave Ward, the CWU general secretary, said: \u201cThis is an important moment and we can go forward into any action knowing we have secured the numbers required. We have seen an unprecedented response from our members, and we are taking a lot of confidence from this result. \u201cOur members are under attack. They are being asked to work faster, harder and cheaper while losing benefits. This has nothing to do with driving growth and innovation. It is all about a lack of forward thinking and asset stripping.\u201d Royal Mail said it was very disappointed by the ballot result, which did not necessarily mean a strike would take place. \u201cThere are no grounds for industrial action. We want to reach agreement. Royal Mail is committed to further talks as a matter of urgency, to reach agreement with the CWU,\u201d the company said. Royal Mail said contractual dispute resolution procedures agreed to by the company and the CWU meant the dispute would be escalated to independent external mediation, \u201cwhich we expect will take close to Christmas to be completed, and maybe longer\u201d. It added: \u201cWe believe these dispute resolution procedures must be followed. The union cannot take industrial action until they have been completed.\u201d The CWU announced last month that it would be balloting members who worked for Royal Mail group and claimed there were plans to worsen terms and conditions of existing employees and introduce a two-tier workforce. However, it is the pensions row that is at the heart of the dispute, after Royal Mail announced it wanted to end the defined-benefit scheme. In April, the company announced that the pension plan, which has 90,000 members and assets of \u00a37.4bn, was in surplus, but said the scheme would soon become unaffordable. The company, which was privatised in October 2013, pays \u00a3400m a year into the fund but it says this could rise to more than \u00a31bn in 2018. The scheme, which was closed to new members in 2008, guarantees a pension based on a postal worker\u2019s average salary. Royal Mail is thought to have plans to replace it with a less generous defined-contribution scheme. In a move that may be copied by other unions, the vote followed a campaign by the CWU called the \u201cfour pillars\u201d, which calls for a decent wage in retirement, a shorter working week, a redesign of the company\u2019s methods and an extension of current agreements. The union has held a series of \u201cgate meetings\u201d outside sorting offices to gain support among members before the ballot. Royal Mail argues it is operating in the most competitive delivery market in the world, with 16 major competitors including Amazon, which handles one in 10 parcel deliveries. Letter volumes have declined 40% in the past 10 years as people increasingly prefer email. Royal Mail says it has spent \u00a31.5bn on upgrading its IT systems to cope with the new world of technology. After 12 months in the job, postal workers earn \u00a322,764 a year. Royal Mail says under its proposed scheme, someone aged 50, earning \u00a325,000 a year and retiring at 65 would retire on an annual pension of \u00a312,300 and a tax-free lump sum of \u00a381,800. It says this compares favourably with most other retirement deals.",

      "bodyText": "Colman\u2019s Mustard could be on the brink of severing its historical links with Norwich after Unilever said it was reviewing the future of its factory in the city. Colman\u2019s has been based in Norfolk since Jeremiah Colman started his mustard and flour business on the outskirts of Norwich in 1814. The brand also sponsored the city\u2019s football team for a period. But the future of the plant is in doubt after Britvic, the soft-drinks maker behind Robinsons, which co-owns the site, said it would be pulling out in 2019. About 350 jobs are at risk as a result of the changes. Unilever confirmed it had begun a review of the Norwich plant, where pots of \u201cColman\u2019s of Norwich\u201d have been produced since 1858, and one of the options on the table was to close it down. \u201cBritvic and Unilever\u2019s operations have been uniquely intertwined at the site for many years, relying on a shared infrastructure. Although no decisions have been made, we need to recognise that Britvic\u2019s proposed withdrawal would have serious implications for Unilever in Norwich,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe review will look in detail at the impact of Britvic\u2019s proposed withdrawal from the site and will consider options for the most effective sourcing of the current Norwich product range. One of those options will include the potential closure of our Norwich factory.\u201d The company, which has 113 employees in Norwich, said it recognised Colman\u2019s Norwich heritage and would work to retain that link whatever the outcome of the review. Staff working at the Unilever and Britvic sites share facilities such as canteens and toilets. There is also a shared steam room that supplies both factories. Britvic makes its Robinsons and Fruit Shoot products in Norwich, but plans to transfer production to its other sites in east London, Leeds and Rugby. The move is part of a three-year efficiency drive that involves investing \u00a3240m in its UK manufacturing base. Britvic said it would embark on a consultation process with the 242 affected staff before the site\u2019s proposed closure at the end of 2019. Rhys McCarthy, a Unite national officer, said: \u201cThis is very painful news for our members and their families at Britvic, and we will be giving the maximum support to our members at what is a very difficult time in the days and weeks ahead. \u201cThe sad news that Britvic is closing its operations in Norwich also has an impact on Unilever workers who share the same site.\u201d McCarthy expressed his concern that Unilever will be eager to please shareholders after it rebuffed Kraft Heinz\u2019s \u00a3115bn takeover bid in February. \u201cColman\u2019s Mustard is Norwich and Norwich is Colman\u2019s Mustard. The whole of Norfolk needs to come together to fight for the future of Colman\u2019s Mustard, which is so identified with the city of Norwich,\u201d he said. Paul Polman, Unilever\u2019s chief executive, is reviewing the company\u2019s Anglo-Dutch corporate structure, and has put its margarines and spreads business up for sale. The company has also launched a \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.4bn) share buyback and set a public target of achieving 20% profit margins by 2020.",

The UK is only behind Turkey, Mexico and the eastern European states of Latvia and Estonia in the club of 35 developed nations. The annual growth in prices in the UK jumped to 2.9% in August from 2.6% in July, equalling a four-year high in the consumer price index (CPI) reached in May earlier this year. That outstrips the average 2.2% growth in prices across the OECD for the same month. The UK ranked top for inflation among the G7, whose other members are the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. The rise in prices was also above the averages for the euro area, the wider European Union and the G20 nations. Turkey had the highest inflation rate at 10.7%, followed by Mexico at 6.7%. Israel was the only country to record falling prices, at -0.1%. Major central banks around the world target an inflation rate of 2% to encourage their economies to expand at a sustainable pace. The Paris-based organisation found energy price inflation accelerated to 5.9% in the year to August, compared with 3.7% in July. Food price inflation also rose, albeit at a slower pace, to 1.8% in August, compared with 1.7% in July. Excluding food and energy, inflation was stable across the OECD nations at 1.8% for the fourth consecutive month. The figures illustrate the UK\u2019s reliance on imports, which have become costlier since the Brexit vote sparked sterling\u2019s devaluation. The pound remains about 10% below its level immediately before the referendum. Prices in non-food stores and online rose at the strongest annual growth rate since 1992 in August, although shoppers continued to spend against the forecasts of City economists. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee estimates CPI will peak above 3% this month, before falling over the coming months. Threadneedle Street is considering whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade from as early as next month. Raising the cost of borrowing may help to cut the rate of growth in prices, as it should curb the amount of money available in the economy to buy goods. However, a rate rise also risks undermining economic growth by removing cheap money available to consumers and businesses. The Bank has been warned against raising interest rates amid weak signals for economic growth. The OECD estimates France, Italy and Germany will grow faster than the UK amid uncertainty from Brexit, which is hitting consumer confidence and sapping business investment. The group of wealthy nations forecasts the UK\u2019s GDP growth will drop from 1.6% this year to 1% next year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair pilots are being investigated by HM Revenue &amp; Customs over complex employment structures imposed on them by the no-frills airline. Several experienced pilots told the Guardian that they have faced tax investigations relating to the way in which they are employed by Ryanair. Europe\u2019s busiest airline is already grappling with a PR disaster caused by errors in how pilots are rostered for work \u2013 leading to the cancellation of tens of thousands of flights through to March next year, which has disrupted the travel plans of 700,000 passengers. Ryanair has also clashed with its pilots over their working conditions, with many complaining about the same contract arrangements that have piqued HMRC\u2019s interest. The tax authority\u2019s focus on individual pilots emerged two years after it launched an investigation into Ryanair\u2019s use of agencies such as Brookfield Aviation to provide about half of its 4,200 pilots. Those who apply to join Ryanair are told to set up an Irish limited company and are made directors of it, under the guidance of accountants recommended by the airline. That company then supplies pilots to one of several agencies, including Brookfield Aviation and McGinley Aviation, who in turn supply them to Ryanair. The system limits Ryanair\u2019s obligations to the pilots, such as sick pay \u2013 among the factors that allows the Dublin-based carrier to keep its costs low. But the use of Irish limited companies to employ pilots based in the UK has led to pilots with limited experience of the tax obligations of a limited company falling foul of its fraud investigators. One UK-based pilot said he has been under investigation since February 2015, and is being questioned by HMRC about an employment structure he had no choice but to use. \u201cWhen I started employment, I had to set up a limited company in Ireland with two other pilots who I knew from training and were employed by Ryanair at the same time. We had to go to Ireland, meet their accountant and set up a company.\u201d He said his lack of experience of acting as a company director meant he left tax affairs to the accountant recommended by Ryanair, but has still been hit with a two-year investigation. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting there waiting for the brown envelope to hit the doormat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m no tax expert and I thought I was doing everything correctly. Now I\u2019ve had to send my logbook off, which is priceless to me.\u201d A former colleague, who used to train pilots for Ryanair, said: \u201cThe public should be aware that some of the pilots flying the planes are stressed because of the way they operate. \u201cYou have HMRC hounding people who have been pulled into this system that is run by Ryanair.\u201d A third pilot, who is under investigation for non-payment of taxes over five years, said HMRC told him tax on his earnings should have been paid in the UK, even though he was employed by an Irish limited company. He said he had been given \u201cno control over the governance of the way [tax] was being paid\u201d. According to one letter sent to him by HMRC and seen by the Guardian, the tax authority conceded that he had not \u201cengineered\u201d the complex structure and was simply trying to gain employment. \u201cYou speak to some of the people affected by this and they\u2019re broken men,\u201d he added. Another pilot showed the Guardian a document in which the agency he worked for told him sign a disclaimer to say he was not an employee of the company but of his own Irish limited company. He said this structure ultimately led HMRC to look into his tax affairs, causing him undue anxiety. \u201cIt was one of my main reasons for leaving. I was sick of always being worried if I was paying tax correctly,\u201d he said. And he warned that pilots from other countries are also facing investigations by their domestic authorities. \u201cI flew with one guy who had to sell his house and car because he\u2019d been landed with a tax bill of \u20ac40,000,\u201d he said. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t been fiddling it on purpose but he\u2019d just got it wrong.\u201d A fifth pilot said British pilots were now worried about their homes being raided, pointing to action taken by Germany tax authorities last year over pilots employed by Brookfield Aviation. \u201cImagine doing this job when you are constantly worrying about whether what you are doing tax-wise is legal, simply because you are not given any other option by your own employer,\u201d he said. All of the pilots interviewed also warned that the use of self-employed contracts, which do not entitle them to sick pay, meant some were turning up to work even if they were ill. HMRC said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on identifiable individuals or organisations.\u201d Ryanair said: \u201cWe do not comment on rumour or speculation.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Lending to UK firms at risk after Brexit, Bank of England warns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned that lending to businesses could dry up after Brexit because not enough preparations are being made by companies in the EU to keep operating in the UK after March 2019. Companies from European Economic Area countries \u2013 EU member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway \u2013 provide about 10% of lending to UK businesses and would need to reapply for authorisation to operate in Britain after it leaves the EU. In its latest update on potential risks to financial stability, the Bank of England said: \u201cThe risk of disruption to wholesale UK banking services appeared to be slightly higher than previously thought, given that a number of EEA firms branching into the UK were not sufficiently focused on addressing this issue. \u201cFirms would need to start seeking authorisations in [the first quarter of] 2018. Their plans were also reliant on a greater degree of cooperation between the UK and EU.\u201d The Bank said its financial services regulatory body, the Prudential Regulation Authority, was working with companies to \u201cimprove the state of their contingency planning\u201d. A year ago, the Financial Conduct Authority released data showing just over 8,000 companies, including banks, which were authorised in other EU countries, rely on a \u201cpassport\u201d to operate in the UK. In the banking sector, for instance, about 70 companies operate this way, and Sam Woods, the Bank of England deputy governor responsible for regulation, has previously warned of the burden that would be placed on the regulator if it had to authorise EU businesses that could no longer rely on passports to operate in the UK. In an interview with Reuters last week, Woods said he expected 130 financial companies from across Europe to apply for licences to continue operating in the UK after Brexit. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, set up after the 2008 crisis, said there were \u201csignificant risks\u201d from disruption to the way trades are conducted through clearing houses after Brexit. The latest record of the FPC\u2019s quarterly meeting published text redacted from an update in March, when it had been discussing reforms to Libor, the London interbank offered rate. At the time, the committee was concerned about the financial stability risk posed by the market\u2019s reliance on Libor, which is used to price $350tn (\u00a3264tn) of financial products around the world. It was proving difficult to get accurate prices because not enough activity was taking place to set the rate, since changes were made to the way it is calculated after Libor was found to have been rigged. The notes were released after Andrew Bailey, the FCA chief executive, spelled out in July how Libor would be phased out over the next four years.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s construction industry has contracted for the first time since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, as rising political uncertainty leads to a sustained drop in new work. September data revealed a difficult month for building companies, as new projects failed to materialise to replenish jobs planned before the referendum. The drop in workload was attributed to fragile confidence and subdued appetite for risk, especially in the commercial building sector. The headline reading on the Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI report (pdf) fell to 48.1 last month from 51.1 in August. That places the industry below the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction and misses a forecast of 51 by economists in a Reuters poll. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which helps to compile the survey of 170 companies in the construction industry, said: \u201cRespondents pointed to obstructive economic conditions and the Brexit blight of uncertainty, freezing clients into indecision over new projects.\u201d The lower volumes of work reflect a marked decline for both commercial and civil engineering activity last month. Civil engineering activity experienced the steepest fall in almost four and a half years, with some companies reporting a lack of new work to replace completed contracts. Housebuilding was the only area to register any expansion last month, although the momentum was the slowest in six months amid worries over the immediate future for the housing market. The figures will disappoint government ministers who have been pushing to end a chronic housing shortage. Theresa May, looking to woo younger voters at her party\u2019s conference in Manchester this week, announced a \u00a310bn expansion of the Tories\u2019 flagship help-to-buy scheme to provide loans to first-time buyers. Construction companies will be looking to Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn budget next month for further support to offset the uncertainty created by Brexit. The survey showed business optimism fell to its second-lowest level since April 2013. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the readings suggest the government\u2019s shift to a more accommodating stance in Brexit talks had \u201cdone little to convince builders that clients will sanction delayed projects soon\u201d. Although the construction industry accounts for only about 6.1% of total output, the weak readings suggest the sector could drag on GDP growth. The figures also follow a softer manufacturing survey for September \u2013 with both combining to suggest the British economy is faltering. Builders saw a spike in costs linked to the weak pound, given a substantial amount of building components and materials are imported, with input costs rising at the fastest pace for seven months in September. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cMuted economy activity and appreciable economic and political uncertainties threaten to be a highly challenging combination for the construction sector over the coming months.\u201d The weak reading may discourage the Bank of England from hiking interest rates as early as next month, which would be the first rise in the cost of borrowing in more than a decade. Mark Carney suggested the Bank could raise the rate in the \u201ccoming months\u201d should the economy perform as hoped. The pound dropped 0.2% against the dollar to $1.3249 after the release of the data, suggesting markets doubt Threadneedle Street will make the move any time soon. Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at IG, said the reading \u201cundoubtedly takes the shine off expectations for a UK rate hike later this year\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The collapse of Monarch was timed to avoid more disruption and could not have been averted because of Britain\u2019s insolvency laws, the airline\u2019s chief executive has said. Monarch was placed into administration at 4am on Monday, triggering Britain\u2019s biggest peacetime repatriation of stranded air travellers, which is expected to take about two weeks to complete. Andrew Swaffield, the Monarch CEO, said executives had \u201cleft no stone unturned\u201d in their effort to save the airline, but concluded on Saturday night that there was no prospect of recovery. However, Monarch waited more than 24 hours to go into administration to allow the Civil Aviation Authority to prepare its emergency flight operation. The CAA brought 11,843 Monarch customers back to the UK on 61 flights on Monday, with a further 11,647 passengers expected to travel home on Tuesday on specially chartered planes. Swaffield said: \u201cWe made the decision finally late on Saturday night that we no longer had a prospect of continuing. What we tried to do is operate a normal schedule all day Sunday so we could be ready for the CAA\u2019s rescue flights on Monday without a massive backlog. Had we stopped on Sunday there would have been no planes to rescue them.\u201d Speaking to the BBC, he told of his \u201csorrow\u201d for both the disruption and the fate of Monarch\u2019s employees, but said the UK\u2019s insolvency laws did not allow the airline to continue flying. Observers have questioned why the government did not step in to prop up the failing airline, after Germany and Italy respectively assisted Air Berlin and Alitalia, which continue to fly. Swaffield said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have that legal framework, we couldn\u2019t continue operating. We spoke to a variety of sources, tried to leave no stone unturned, including trying to raise capital, selling parts of the company, and finally concluded that we had no prospect.\u201d Monarch had projected losses of more than \u00a3100m. Swaffield said the airline was trying to find jobs for more than 1,800 people already made redundant, with hundreds more head office staff to follow. The government is hoping to reduce the estimated \u00a360m cost to taxpayers of bringing 110,000 Monarch customers back to the UK from overseas by splitting some of the bill with tour operators and credit card companies. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said the government would be speaking to third-party tour operators and credit card companies with the hope of recouping some of the cost on behalf of taxpayers. The main priority, however, was to bring everybody back to the UK, he said. The CAA said it was \u201cworking round the clock\u201d with the government to ensure all Monarch customers were back in Britain by Sunday 15 October. \u201cWe recognise that this will be a concerning time for many customers and we really appreciate their support,\u201d said Andrew Haines, the chief executive of the CAA. \u201cI want to thank all those involved in organising this mammoth operation, which has got off to a good start, and to reaffirm our commitment to those passengers still abroad that we will get them back to the UK in the days ahead.\u201d He said the CAA helpline had taken more than 13,000 calls and the website monarch.caa.co.uk had been updated with the latest information. \u201cGiven the unprecedented scale of this task some disruption is inevitable. We thank everyone involved for their patience,\u201d Haines said. The CAA has chartered 34 planes to fly the passengers back from more than 30 airports across Europe. Monarch customers overseas have been told that the vast majority of flights will be at the same time or later than their original booking. All future Monarch flights and holidays have been cancelled, with customers in the UK told not to go the airport.",

      "bodyText": "QBE Insurance, one of the world\u2019s biggest insurance companies, has warned 2017 will likely be the \u201ccostliest year in the history of the global insurance industry\u201d after a series of catastrophic hurricanes in recent months. The Sydney-based insurer told shareholders to brace for a multimillion-dollar hit to its pre-tax profits and has increased its 2017 large individual risk and catastrophe claims allowance to cope with the surge in claims. John Neal, QBE\u2019s chief executive, told the Australian Stock Exchange on Tuesday that Australia\u2019s Cyclone Debbie from March and April, and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which hit the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean and Florida, as well the recent earthquakes in Mexico, had all affected QBE\u2019s businesses. He said the global group had been forced to increase its 2017 allowance for large individual risk and catastrophe claims to $1.75bn, leading to a pre-tax hit to profits worth $600m. \u201cThe catastrophic events over the past month have caused a tragic loss of life and substantial and widespread property and infrastructure damage,\u201d Neal said on Tuesday. \u201cOur thoughts are with those affected by these devastating events including our customers, businesses partners and employees. \u201cGiven catastrophe losses to date, 2017 will likely prove to be the costliest year in the history of the global insurance industry.\u201d Neal\u2019s note to shareholders follows a landmark statement from Australia\u2019s financial regulator earlier this year warning that climate change posed a material risk to Australia\u2019s entire financial system and urging companies to start adapting. Geoff Summerhayes, from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, a former CEO of Suncorp Life, delivered the warning at the Insurance Council of Australia\u2019s annual forum in Sydney in February. Summerhayes said much of the early policy thinking about climate change had focused on the risks to insurance firms and their exposure to losses from increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters but other groups, such as banks, asset managers and superannuation funds, needed to start adapting too. In June the Senate passed a motion for an inquiry into the threats and long-term risks posed by climate change to national and international security, and Australia\u2019s readiness to mitigate and respond to climate-related crises in the region. Neal said on Tuesday that this year\u2019s natural disasters had pushed the target for QBE group\u2019s 2017 combined underwriting ratio on its insurance business (which drives the group\u2019s underwriting profit) to 100%-102%. That means QBE is sitting somewhere between breakeven and a 2% loss on its top line at the underwriting level. However, a spokesman said QBE was still on track to generate investment returns of roughly 3% this year and those investment returns would offset the group\u2019s underwriting performance, so QBE would still record a pre-tax profit this year. Neal said it was too early to speculate how much reinsurance and primary insurance pricing would rise as a consequence of this year\u2019s natural disasters. QBE would stand to benefit from the price rises because much of its reinsurance programs had already been purchased for 2018. QBE\u2019s share price fell 3.73% by lunchtime on Tuesday. Australia\u2019s 2016 defence white paper said climate change would contribute to state fragility, which it identified as one of the six key drivers that will \u201cshape the development of Australia\u2019s security environment to 2035\u201d. Late last year, an analysis by a coalition of the world\u2019s biggest insurers found that the insurance \u201cprotection gap\u201d \u2013 the difference between the costs of natural disasters and the amount insured \u2013 had quadrupled to $100bn a year since the 1980s.",
