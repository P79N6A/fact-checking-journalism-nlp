      "bodyText": "Angry Birds was the biggest selling app in the Apple online store when in November 2011 it was pushed off its perch by a 12-year-old schoolboy's creation. Harry Moran's Pizzabot, a reworking of Space Invaders, also drove down a release from the Call of Duty series when it debuted on the chart, leading to the Irish boy being dubbed the youngest successful app developer in the world. More remarkable was that the game was produced as a homework assignment from his local computer club. Harry is one of thousands of children aged between five and 17 across 27 countries who have learned computer skills though a network of volunteer-led CoderDojos, after-school clubs that teach coding, website development and game creation among other skills. The 220 clubs that have sprung up worldwide over the last two and a half years started when James Whelton, now 21, saw demand for his after-school meetings teaching HTML and CSS expand beyond the corridors of Presentation Brothers College in Cork. By that stage, the young Irishman had been earning money building websites for local businesses for six years and was the first person in the world to hack a new iPod, in turn building up his reputation among online peers. It was a distant cry from his more solitary early years. \"I say to people that some kids have friends when they were growing up, I had keyboards,\" he said. \"I saw that computing was a very real thing just through the feeling and pure ecstasy of solving a problem, or getting people to visit a website and seeing that it was a sustainable thing. \"People heard that I could hack because I had my track record as an academic underachiever and people thought that if that idiot Whelton can programme, then anyone can. I think my friends were interested and we organised a get-together. It was now cool in a lot of people's eyes.\" Whelton's online reputation resulted in an invitation to speak at the Dublin Web Summit in 2011, on the same day that he was due to sit his mock final maths exam, where he met Bill Liao, an Australian entrepreneur who wanted to take the classes further. In the summer of 2011, the CoderDojos \u2013 named after martial arts training areas or \"dojos\" \u2013 began to spread, around Ireland and then abroad. In the UK there are 37, with 10 in Japan, four in India and one each in Panama, Bolivia, South Africa and Brazil. IT professionals give up their time to help children learn to code, at the same time encouraging the children to eventually become tutors themselves. The classes are held in universities and company offices empty at weekends \u2013 among other venues \u2013 in what is called \"an open-source, volunteer-led, global movement\" where children under the age of 12 have to be accompanied by an adult. Rules are thin on the ground, apart from: \"Be Cool \u2013 bullying, lying, wasting people's time and so on is uncool.\" \"The idea of a computer club is not new, you are just essentially throwing people in a room and trying to teach them. But what you are teaching them \u2013 helping others, being open and transparent \u2013 was what defined us,\" Whelton said. \"There were a lot of philosophies we liked around the dojo \u2013 when you go to one you get help, work in teams, practise what you have done, show off what you have done. The more senior you get, the more you mentor young people. \"We applied a lot of these logics and principles to a coding club. We thought that if we influenced how we taught kids programming we could get to make more apps that were open source. We could get them to make apps for social causes and for good.\" The appetite for the computing dojos grew quickly. The Dublin class was frequently booked up in less than a minute, while word soon spread to Japan and the US, where dojos were also set up. Their success comes from working with a generation of children who have had access to computing since they were a young age, while at the same time not having to adhere to traditional classroom teaching structures, said Whelton. Some of the measurements of the clubs' successes are how previously insular or isolated children come out of their shells in the classes, he said. \"Screw creating the next Mark Zuckerberg. I want to see kids who become passionate about programming and go into medicine and politics, go into whatever field and use their skills to solve problems there and completely revolutionise it. I think that is infinitely more powerful to our society,\" Whelton said. The CoderDojo movement is reflective of discontent within the IT industry that governments are not doing enough to teach children proper computing skills, limiting lessons to how to use word processing and spreadsheets. \"I felt that if we could identify ourselves as an entity outside government, we could operate independently. We are more powerful outside government,\" said Whelton. \"It is pretty mind-blowing to me. It is a lot of stress and I think that because you want to do well for these people, you push yourself more and more. When you are working in non-profit your metric is impact, how much we do. If I have to get myself pumped up to talk to people, that is when I have to pull up the feelings of parents and the impact of what it has done [for] their child.\" Whelton, who spent his early days on the project hopping between friends' couches, was named by Forbes magazine as one of 30 people under the age of 30 to watch. A foundation was recently set up to manage the CoderDojo movement. His next goal is to make himself redundant from his position as figurehead of the movement. \"I'm not the wick nor wax but the spark,\" he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The president of the international co-operative movement has launched a stinging attack on the former boss of the Co-operative Group, Euan Sutherland, for creating a culture clash at the 170-year-old mutual and failing to heed the views of its 8 million members. Dame Pauline Green said Sutherland, who quit amid a row over his \u00a36.6m pay deal, had bungled consultation with Co-op members about the group's future and was wrong to switch focus of the group's senior executives from the heart of the organisation in Manchester to London. She also warned that the poor handling of proposals from former Labour minister Lord Myners to reform the Co-op boardroom has exacerbated the situation, leading to \"suspicion\" and \"mistrust\" between members and management. In addition Green, president of the International Co-operative Alliance, which is akin to an international trade union for co-operatives, took issue with Sutherland's description of the Co-op Group as \"ungovernable\". In an article for the Guardian, Green also accuses Sutherland of losing touch with the co-operative movement. \"The current problems at the Co-operative Group come down to a culture clash between the management and members who own the Co-operative Group,\" she says. Despite her criticism of the management \u2013 who do not have seats on the board, which is made up of members of the co-operative movement \u2013 she urges the board to give \"serious consideration\" to proposals to reform the structure devised by Myners. She said she advocated changes five years ago. Myners has proposed the Co-op set up a new board, similar to a typical plc boardroom with a place for the chief executive. Myners also wants a separate national membership council to represent members. Sutherland arrived last May and was confronted by the near collapse of the bank \u2013 now propped up by \u00a31.5bn of fresh capital. Last month he embarked on a public survey, encouraging staff, members and shoppers to \"have your say\" on the group's future. Green described that initiative as ill-judged. She said it had \"crystallised fears amongst the members about the downgrading of their ownership rights by asking leading questions that appeared to be a direct attack on (Co-op) principles like an economic return to members, or member control\". She said Sutherland's decision to move the \"entire new executive management team\" to London was a bad move which had resulted in \"undermining confidence and morale in Manchester, and isolating the executive group from everyday contact with the remaining vestiges of co-operative knowledge and experience\". A spokeswoman for Co-op said that while a London office had been established, it was wrong to say any senior executives had been relocated. \"Did management spend more time in London over the last year than before? Yes. But no one was relocated and Manchester remains the head office,\" she explained. She added that Sutherland had always made clear he understood and was committed to the founding principles of the Co-op organisation, adding: \"The 'Have Your Say' initiative which ends on Monday was all about ensuring all 8m members of the organisation had their views heard rather than just the 600 active members who tended to be on area and regional committees.\" With the farms and pharmacy chain up for sale, the group had been expected to report losses of at least \u00a32bn on Wednesday, largely caused by problems inside its troubled banking arm, which is now just 30% owned by the Co-op. However, the results have now been delayed until 17 April as a result of the upheaval caused by Sutherland's resignation. Green said he should be replaced by someone able to repair the damage to relations with members and a \"commitment to the co-operative values and principles\". Green also defended the co-operative model, saying that the \"investor-led business model\" was still being used to run banks despite the near meltdown of the financial system in 2008. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 March",

      "bodyText": "Pension saving is on the increase in Britain. The rise has nothing to do with George Osborne's budget last week but is the result of employees being automatically enrolled in company schemes if they are over 22 and earn more than \u00a39,440 a year. Previously, employees had to opt-in to workplace schemes, so fewer did. Millions more will save for their retirement as a result of this relatively small change. The former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell is a strong believer in behavioural economics. He says, for example, that the Treasury could vastly increase its tax take with a small change to the self-assessment forms sent out by Revenue and Customs. At present, an individual fills in the form and on completion signs the form. Lord O'Donnell says the warning that false declarations can lead to prosecution should be put in big block capitals at the top of page 1. That would immediately alert people to the risks involved in trying to cheat the taxman and lead to billions of pounds of extra revenue. This is an example of \"nudge\" economics. A shove in a certain direction can often have dramatic results. Humans are complex and don't always behave in the way economic textbooks say they should. Sometimes they override the rules of supply and demand. Sometimes they have to be persuaded by outside agencies to act in a certain way. In France, there are around 15,000 growers of grapes for 66 champagne houses. The industry is geographically concentrated and the grapes vary little in quality. With this sort of homogenous product, you would expect each of the 66 houses to pay the same market price for its grapes. Not so, according to a paper by Amandine Ody-Brasier of the Yale management school and Freek Vermeulen, of the London business school. The grape sellers have a certain idea of what a champagne house should look like, and are prepared to punish those that don't match up to expectations with higher prices for their raw materials. What the growers like are houses run by a descendent of the founder, those located in one of the traditional champagne villages with a long history of producing bubbly. What they don't like are newcomers to the industry, those houses owned by a corporate group, those that supply supermarket brands, those that operate winemaking subsidiaries abroad, or those that try to buy their own vineyards. Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon can expect to pay more for its grapes than Pol Roger because it is owned by the luxury brand conglomerate LMVH. One grower quoted in the paper sums up the distaste for the arriviste houses. \"Some of these firms, they come and go. Who knows for how long they're here, where they'll be in 5 or 10 years? They would leave tomorrow if they stopped making money. They don't care about champagne.\" The paper shows that the price differences paid by champagne houses are quite substantial, with a gap of several euros at an average price of \u20ac9 (\u00a37.5) per kilogram. Now, it could be argued that champagne is a special case. Global demand is rising and it can only be supplied from one area of France. Growers make tidy profit margins and can therefore afford to behave with Gallic disdain toward those for whom they do not care. But economics theory suggests that the growers will be seeking to maximise their profits rather than offering discounted prices to Krug simply because the house was founded in 1843. This is not the case, and it is the result of market forces being tempered by social norms rather than by a cartel. As the paper notes, \"the prices different organisations are charged for their purchases depend substantially on whether they meet local expectations for who they are and what they do. Our qualitative evidence confirms that this differential pricing by growers occurs not through collusion but through a spontaneous bottom-up process.\" For some reason, a Formula 1 grand prix ends up with the winner being drenched in champagne and it is the motor racing industry that provides the second example of how economics works. This time, though, the lesson (provided courtesy of John Llewellyn of Llewellyn Consulting) is about how regulation can prompt innovation. Three years ago, the F1 authorities announced big changes to the rules governing engine size and fuel capacity. By this year, 2.4 litre normally aspirated V8 engines had to be replaced by 1.6 litre turbo-charged engines \u2013 a one-third cut in capacity. Simultaneously, fuel consumption \u2013 hitherto unlimited but averaging 160kg per race \u2013 had to be reduced to 100kg. Lots of smart technologists and engineers work for the F1 industry and the new regulations forced them to find ways of making cars more fuel efficient without loss of power. They recognised that in an internal combustion engine only around one third of the fuel used actually propels the car, and went about recovering some of the lost energy. As a result, this year's F1 cars have two new energy-recovery systems: kinetic energy released when Sebastian Vettel slams on the brakes is converted into electrical energy; and energy formerly lost through the exhaust is turned into electrical energy. As Llewellyn notes, the boffins have done an amazing job. The old V8 engines produced more than 750 brake horsepower, but the one-third smaller V6 engines produce 600 bhp (only 20% less). In addition, the energy recovery systems are designed to provide an additional 160bhp for 33 seconds every lap. So the new engines will produce as much power as the old engines, using 40% less fuel. This is not just a matter that should interest petrol heads. Llewellyn says applying this technology to everyday motor vehicles could cut global oil consumption by 2% or more a year. \"But this F1 experience has a deeper significance: it shows what clever people can do when motivated.\" Sometimes the motivation is money. Sometimes it is just plain curiosity. But quite often, clever people have to be pointed in the right direction. \"This typically requires that government be involved: to identify the problem; specify it; corral key people; offer the prize; provide funding. Witness the second world war, which on that basis produced radar, radio navigation, the jet engine, rocketry and nuclear energy,\" Llewellyn says. Could the same approach help in the fight against global warming? Yes, of course, but only under certain conditions. Governments have to be fully committed \u2013 as they are under war conditions and sometimes (the space race) in peace time too. They need to learn the lessons of auto enrolment, the champagne industry and F1. And be prepared to shove as well as nudge.",

      "bodyText": "Co-operative Group's crucial vote on whether to adopt the proposals for radical reform put forward by Lord Myners is to take place in early summer. The move will put on the spot the 100 or so members of the co-operative movement who will determine the future of the troubled chain of supermarkets and funeral homes. Myners, who was chairman of Guardian Media Group until he was elevated to the Lords to become City minister during the banking crisis, has calculated that, as a result of its intricate structure and the block voting system on which it operates, the fate of the loss-making group will in fact lie with just 50 of them. Speaking on a webcast last week, the Labour peer said his reforms were facing strong opposition. He said that one director on the board claimed to control as many as 28% of the votes, which may be influential, because proposals need more than a simple majority to pass. The remark made it clear that battle lines have already been drawn, because no one director can actually control that many votes without the tacit support of others. The board is made up of five members from the independent Co-ops \u2013 of which Midcounties is the biggest \u2013 and 15 representatives from seven regional boards, who include a nurse, a university lecturer and, until the hasty exit last year of Paul Flowers, a Methodist minister. Myners joined the board as an independent director following his appointment in December, with a remit to overhaul the governance of the troubled organisation. But the board on its own cannot block or endorse Myners' proposals, which include creating a board more akin to that of a plc, with a chairman, a chief executive and non-executive directors, as well as a new national membership council to represent the seven million members. That endorsement can come only from the members of the regional boards and independent societies. They meet twice a year and this year will be asked to attend a special general meeting to vote on the Myners proposals. The seven regional boards control 78% of the votes, and the 19 independent societies 22%. The seven boards are each made up of up to 16 individuals, each of whom has a different level of influence according to how much business is done in those regions. The north region is the biggest, with around a fifth of that 78% share of the votes; Wales is the least influential, with just a 10% share. The remaining regions have roughly the same level of voting power. Within the independent societies, five of the chief executives have seats on the board: they include group chair Ursula Lidbetter (who runs the Lincolnshire Co-op, the sixth-biggest independent), Ben Reid (chief executive of the biggest, Midcounties), and Martyn Cheatle of the next-largest, the Midlands Co-op. At annual meetings, voting power is determined by size \u2013 so Midcounties and Midlands have the largest proportion of the 22% voting power available. In the immediate aftermath of Euan Sutherland's resignation as chief executive, the board agreed in principle to adopt the Myners reforms and recommend to the regional boards that they also endorse them. But that may just signal the start of horse-trading ahead of the summer vote, by which time the regional boards \u2013 whose members are themselves selected from more than 40 area committees \u2013 will need to be convinced to back the Myners reforms.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's husbands (if you excuse the generalisation) are wearily accustomed to cynicism from their wives, after insisting a faltering do-it-yourself project will look great in the end. As most amateurs eventually admit, the incredulous reaction is usually shrewd, which is why botching your own plumbing is proving less and less popular compared with hiring a pro. Similarly, the City invoked disbelieving looks when execs from B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher kept promising that, despite tricky markets, its \"self-help\" plan to revive the retailer would eventually look like a professional job. But, unlike its customers, the execs are now proudly showcasing their handiwork: the shares, which for years wobbled like a cheap barbecue, surged last year; meanwhile, as Kingfisher unveils results this week, there's talk of returning money to shareholders. Still, surging profits at its Screwfix business put a gloss on falls at B&amp;Q. So there remains a slight worry that, like an embattled husband, somebody has papered over the odd crack. King Digital heads for Crushing market debut Wall Street is partying like it's 1999 \u2013 which you may recall was the peak of the dotcom bubble. Five flotations launched on Friday alone, raising $572m (\u00a3347m) and taking the number of US initial public offerings to 53 for 2014 \u2013 Investors.com reports \u2013 up from 30 at the same point last year. Another nine floats are expected this week, and there's a big one of interest here. King Digital Entertainment, the London computer games firm behind the hit Candy Crush Saga, is to make history as the most valuable UK internet company to join the stock markets, at $7.6bn. That will help crystallise another fortune for former Derby County director, Melvyn Morris, who owns 12.2%, not to mention private equity group Apax, whose initial $63m investment is worth about $3.6bn. No wonder, then, that concerns about King's reliance on Candy Crush, which accounts for 78% of its bookings, seem to have been drowned out by a $567.6m profit and the buoyant mood. Nothing can possibly go wrong. The joke could be on you too, George Given that the chancellor seems to consider politics far more deeply than economics, has the Treasury select committee got the invitations to the hearings on last week's budget right? On Tuesday we'll hear from Michael Saunders, head of European economics at Citi, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 although one wonders if Nate Silver, the fashionable psephologist, might be more fitting. The stand-out memories of last week's set piece remain a radical shake-up of savings and pensions (in what looked like an attempt to prevent defections to Ukip), plus an excellent joke about the Magna Carta's 800th anniversary at Ed Miliband's expense. Still, 2015 is also the 200th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo which \u2013 as others have noted before \u2013 provides Miliband with a fictional riposte. In the novel Vanity Fair, the battle proved the end for one rather irresponsible bounder, cheating him of his expected inheritance. His name? George Osborne.",

      "body": "<p>Britain's husbands (if you excuse the generalisation) are wearily accustomed to cynicism from their wives, after insisting a faltering do-it-yourself project will look great in the end.</p> <p>As most amateurs eventually admit, the incredulous reaction is usually shrewd, which is why botching your own plumbing is proving less and less popular compared with hiring a pro.</p> <p>Similarly, the City invoked disbelieving looks when execs from B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher kept promising that, despite tricky markets, its \"self-help\" plan to revive the retailer would eventually look like a professional job.</p> <p>But, unlike its customers, the execs are now proudly showcasing their handiwork: the shares, which for years wobbled like a cheap barbecue, surged last year; meanwhile, as Kingfisher unveils results this week, there's talk of returning money to shareholders.</p> <p>Still, surging profits at its Screwfix business put a gloss on falls at B&amp;Q. So there remains a slight worry that, like an embattled husband, somebody has papered over the odd crack.</p> <h2>King Digital heads for Crushing market debut</h2> <p>Wall Street is partying like it's 1999 \u2013 which you may recall was the peak of the dotcom bubble. Five flotations launched on Friday alone, raising $572m (\u00a3347m) and taking the number of US initial public offerings to 53 for 2014 \u2013 Investors.com reports \u2013 up from 30 at the same point last year.</p> <p>Another nine floats are expected this week, and there's a big one of interest here. King Digital Entertainment, the London computer games firm behind the hit Candy Crush Saga, is to make history as the most valuable UK internet company to join the stock markets, at $7.6bn. That will help crystallise another fortune for former Derby County director, Melvyn Morris, who owns 12.2%, not to mention private equity group Apax, whose initial $63m investment is worth about $3.6bn.</p> <p>No wonder, then, that concerns about King's reliance on Candy Crush, which accounts for 78% of its bookings, seem to have been drowned out by a $567.6m profit and the buoyant mood. Nothing can possibly go wrong.</p> <h2>The joke could be on you too, George<br></h2> <p>Given that the chancellor seems to consider politics far more deeply than economics, has the Treasury select committee got the invitations to the hearings on last week's budget right?</p> <p>On Tuesday we'll hear from Michael Saunders, head of European economics at Citi, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 although one wonders if Nate Silver, the fashionable psephologist, might be more fitting.</p> <p>The stand-out memories of last week's set piece remain a radical shake-up of savings and pensions (in what looked like an attempt to prevent defections to Ukip), plus an excellent joke about the Magna Carta's 800th anniversary at Ed Miliband's expense.</p> <p>Still, 2015 is also the 200th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo which \u2013 as others have noted before \u2013 provides Miliband with a fictional riposte. In the novel <em>Vanity Fair</em>, the battle proved the end for one rather irresponsible bounder, cheating him of his expected inheritance. His name? George Osborne.</p>",

There seems to be a debate about whether it was a case of \"inflation, inflation, inflation \u2026\", or whether inflation was followed by a reaction. The parallels with the economic debate are interesting. We are familiar with business cycles \u2013 nothing to do with pedal cycles, but the tendency of economies to experience bursts of expansion followed by contractions. After the second world war, governments around the world assumed responsibility for trying to control such cycles, or at least to diminish the damage caused by what is now known as \"irrational exuberance\" (during the upturn) and a collapse of confidence (associated with a downturn). It is now widely accepted that policymakers in the advanced industrial countries \"lost the plot\" during the years that preceded the onset in 2007-08 of the worst economic depression since the 1930s. The coalition would have it that it was excessive public spending by New Labour that produced what they like to call \"the mess they inherited\". So far they have been getting away with blue murder in propagating this interpretation of events. By their logic, excessive public spending by the Labour party was responsible for the sharp increase in budget deficits throughout the western world. Sadly they have managed to fool quite a lot of the people quite a lot of the time; but I still hope that their shameless bluff will eventually be called. It was the temporary collapse of the financial system that caused the budgetary crisis \u2013 successive British governments, for instance, had relied too heavily on revenues from the City; and since the crisis the consequences for the City of London have affected both budgetary revenue and the so-called \"invisible\" earnings previously relied upon to offset the chronic deficit on our overseas trade. The big strategic mistake made by George Osborne when he arrived at the Treasury was to focus on the budgetary deficit and not the deficit in our overseas trade. He should have realised that a number of Thatcherite chickens were coming home to roost. The cumulative effect of the neglect of manufacturing is now being seen in our trading performance. And this is aggravated by the way we can no longer rely on the degree of export earnings we enjoyed during the boom years of North Sea oil and gas. Alas, I fear that those of us who warned about the short-sighted view taken of the North Sea bonanza were ignored, and a far-sighted infrastructure programme, by means of a North Sea fund, was never adopted. The chancellor now evidently regards it as a discovery comparable to advances in astrophysics that \"we don't invest enough\" or \"export enough\". A stronger real economy would have gone a long way to ease the budgetary position. The corollary of Osborne's mistaken decision to focus on the deficit \u2013 all those ludicrous comparisons of our situation with that of Greece \u2013 and to declare a second age of austerity was the impact this had on confidence and \"animal spirits\". As if the blow from the financial crisis were not enough, he managed to depress confidence even further. Indeed, policy decisions such as the premature increase in VAT ensured that the burgeoning recovery he inherited was stopped in its tracks. The government now worries that the economy may be some 12% smaller than it should be, and that output has been lost forever. They laugh at Ed Balls, but he was right about three years of \"flatlining\". To my mind there can be little doubt that the last thing the economy needed in 2010 was a contractionary fiscal policy to make things even worse. In common with the economist Bill Martin, I seem to be more confident about the degree of spare capacity in the UK economy than most. But if the pessimists are right, the contraction in business investment amid policies of \"austerity\" must surely have played a part. We are promised yet more years of austerity by a chancellor whose \"plan\" to eliminate the deficit has so far patently failed. No wonder the budget was replete with diversionary announcements \u2013 the principal one, of course, being the decision to free new pensioners from the constraints of low yields on annuities. I love the reaction of my old economist friend Dr Gerard Lyons, who said: \"Everyone is worried that pensioners will be short-term in their thinking [when they come to collect their pension pot]. Welcome to the British economy!\" Now, every schoolchild knows that Osborne wants to succeed David Cameron. One predecessor of Osborne's who did move next door into No 10 was Harold Macmillan. Osborne's supporters think this budget will be remembered for \"the pensions revolution\". Macmillan's one budget (in April 1956) was remembered for the introduction of premium bonds \u2013 and his subsequent premiership saw the signing of the test ban treaty. But when a fellow Conservative once asked Macmillan what he would really like to be remembered for, \"Supermac\" replied: \"The Clean Air Act.\" Personally I should like to forget George Osborne's chancellorship.",

No wonder the budget was replete with diversionary announcements \u2013 the principal one, of course, being the decision to free new pensioners from the constraints of low yields on annuities.</p> <p>I love the reaction of my old economist friend Dr Gerard Lyons, who said: \"Everyone is worried that pensioners will be short-term in their thinking [when they come to collect their pension pot]. Welcome to the British economy!\"</p> <p>Now, every schoolchild knows that Osborne wants to succeed David Cameron. One predecessor of Osborne's who did move next door into No 10 was Harold Macmillan. Osborne's supporters think this budget will be remembered for \"the pensions revolution\". Macmillan's one budget (in April 1956) was remembered for the introduction of premium bonds \u2013 and his subsequent premiership saw the signing of the test ban treaty. But when a fellow Conservative once asked Macmillan what he would really like to be remembered for, \"Supermac\" replied: \"The Clean Air Act.\"</p> <p>Personally I should like to forget George Osborne's chancellorship.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Another week, another five days of upheaval at the Co-operative Group: its management shaken up and its annual results delayed for three weeks \u2013 when \u00a32bn of losses are expected. Britain's biggest mutual has been branded \"ungovernable\" (by its former boss Euan Sutherland when he quit) and accused of organisational chaos that has cost it billions (by its independent director Paul Myners). The scandal has cast a long shadow over the mutual model \u2013 even the Co-op's bank is no longer 100% mutually owned and faces speculation it will delay its own results due this week \u2013 but the Co-op Group is just one of more than 6,000 cooperatives operating in Britain and many of them are thriving. From pubs and football clubs to engineering firms with export order books many public companies would beg for, the co-op model is the basis for successful businesses up and down Britain. The origins of Britain's cooperative movement go back as far the 18th century when workers or consumers banded together to found businesses in mutual self-interest. Then, in 1844, the Rochdale pioneers, the founders of what became the Co-op Group, set down the principles that have guided the development of the sector. Cooperatives are owned by their members, whether employees, customers, a group of companies or a mixture. The members are supposed to have a say in the company's running and a share in its performance, and are meant to work for the greater good. The Co-op Group, spanning supermarkets, funeral parlours, pharmacies and banking, has been the talisman for the movement: a business with a \u00a314bn annual turnover that was seemingly able to take on Tesco and Barclays while espousing ethical principles and low-risk activities \u2013 until it nearly went bust. Myners has argued that the Co-op Group itself has been in decline for many years, with its profile maintained only by disastrous deals such as the takeovers of Somerfield supermarkets and Britannia building society. But while the UK economy was in or near recession between 2008 and 2012, the number of cooperatives in the wider movement rose 28% to 6,169 and turnover jumped 23% to \u00a36.2bn, according to trade body Co-operatives UK. Ed Mayo, chief executive of Co-operatives UK, says: \"In a tough economy it makes commercial sense to have those close to you onside. Being a cooperative is a different way of doing business, which gives ownership not to external investors but to those most directly involved. \"The key for success is then to use that difference to create a competitive advantage. Cooperatives tend to operate with a more committed workforce and a more engaged and loyal customer base \u2013 meaning that sharing ownership can be a way to get ahead.\" The most visible cooperative businesses are the groceries like those first established by the Rochdale pioneers. As well as the Co-operative Group supermarkets, there are hundreds of small retail operations and several large independent retail cooperatives, including Midcounties, the biggest, and Southern. Both have performed strongly while the Co-op Group has floundered \u2013 Southern increased revenue by 26% between 2010 and 2013 to \u00a3327m with profits up 28%. Last year it spent \u00a3450,000 on community projects. By contrast, Myners has accused the Group of neglecting basic retailing and giving up all the market share it gained with the 2009 takeover of Somerfield. Founded 140 years ago, Southern operates 187 convenience stores in the south of England as well as funeral homes and a crematorium. Gemma Lacey, its head of sustainability, says remaining a regional business has kept it closer to its members. Unlike the Co-op Group, which claims 8 million members but only lets regional representatives into its annual meeting, any of Southern's 145,000 members can go to its AGM and more than 300 turned up last year. \"A clear difference for us is our independence and our regional and local focus. All our growth plans are focused on our regional perspective and that plays out in our community programme,\" Lacey says. Co-op Group members were furious when it announced the planned sale of its farms, which it started to buy in the late 1890s to safeguard the supply of produce. But the group's farms are dwarfed by those worked by members of producer cooperatives. These range in size from giant dairy operations Milk Link and First Milk, agrifood business Fane Valley and farming supplies co-operative Mole Valley, down to crop growers that have banded together. Snaith Salad Growers, based in Carlton, Yorkshire, has 14 members and produces about 15m lettuces a year. Simon Deighton, Snaith's general manager, says being a cooperative gives the farms \"strength in unity\" to secure cheaper goods, big contracts from Asda and Sainsbury's and grants from the European Union for equipment and technical help. \"The members of our cooperative wouldn't be very likely to get a contract with a major supermarket individually but combined we can offer more cover and security of supply,\" he says. Britain's most famous conversion to mutual status is the John Lewis Partnership, whose owner signed his department stores over to his employees in 1929. John Lewis is held up as an example of the long-term planning and staff commitment that the Co-op Group has lacked \u2013 this month its record sales surpassed the latest UK sales figures for Marks &amp; Spencer. There have also been far more recent successful transitions to employee ownership. In 1994 David Erdal, chairman of Glenrothes-based paper producer Tullis Russell, transferred the business to its workers because he thought it would function more effectively if they all had a stake. Employees own 7% of the shares directly but the bulk \u2013 65% \u2013 are in an employee trust, with 28% in a charitable trust that gives more than \u00a3200,000 a year to local causes. Every year, a portion of profit is paid out in the form of shares to the employees, who each have an equal stake. The shares have a price determined by a formula based on financial performance but can only be traded in when the company's 476 workers, including 85 in South Korea, retire. Chris Parr, Tullis Russell's managing director, said: \"It is a powerful motivator for all the workforce. You work alongside each other and you both own the same number of shares. I can say to someone: 'If we redouble our efforts and productivity over the next 10 years, when we retire the share price will have gone up', and there's a huge benefit to that.\" The day after the chancellor announced yet another plan to boost manufacturing and exports in last week's budget, the CBI reported a sharp drop in export orders, but Tullis Russell already sells almost three-quarters of its goods abroad. In the same year that Tullis Russell went mutual, Dick Philbrick founded Clansman Dynamics, an East Kilbride engineer that exports 95% of its \"manipulators\" \u2013 or manually operated robots \u2013 and other machinery used in foundries. In 2003, Philbrick sold a machine to the Mondragon cooperative \u2013 the huge manufacturing, retail and banking mutual in the Basque region of Spain \u2013 and was impressed by the motivation of its employees. In 2009, after buying out his fellow shareholders and taking advice from Tullis Russell's Erdal, Philbrick sold the business to his employees for \u00a3200,000. \"There has been a quite extraordinary change over the last four and a half years,\" he says. Staff meetings have become detailed inquisitions and discussions over pizza and Coke about the company's strategy. \"A fitter will say: 'Hey, why aren't we selling in Japan? Isn't it time we fixed that?' Sometimes it's not exactly comfortable. Managers don't like coming back to the next meeting without being able to report progress.\" Since going mutual in the middle of the recession, Clansman has doubled its profits and hired 10 more staff, bringing the total to 40. There are other success stories, such as Dulas, based in Machynlleth, Wales. Its solar panels are mostly sold in the UK but a third of sales are solar medical fridges exported to emerging markets. All three businesses stress their ability to plan for the long term without City investors breathing down their necks. Philbrick says: \"I'm not impressed by rapid growth followed by rapid decline. Engineering companies need long-term decisions to get established. [At a plc,] if there is a drop in profits one quarter, it's treated as a mini-crisis.\" Cooperatives span heavy industry to the creative sector. Two years ago Nick Sharpe founded Nifty Thinking in Leicester as a cooperative bringing freelance designers, copywriters, photographers and others working in branding under one roof. \"It means that as a freelancer, instead of working at home in your pants you can come together and work on bigger and better projects. There's always someone to bounce ideas off, we've got low overheads and we can produce fast turnarounds.\" The movement will need such successes if it is to emerge from under the cloud of the Co-operative Group's troubles. Mayo says: \"I think it has created a question mark over the reputation of the cooperative model, which is not entirely fair. There are more than 6,000 cooperatives in very different markets, but in the public mind they don't necessarily see the differences between them. \"Public trust in the cooperative model is far higher than for business at large, but if one cooperative gets into trouble it can have an impact on all the others.\"",

    "webTitle": "Maidstone Mum backs discounters as supermarket big four are outflanked", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Supermarket chiefs want her custom and politicians want her vote: meet \"Maidstone Mum\", the swing shopper who is changing the status quo. \"I used to do a Tesco online shop all the time \u2013 now I come to Lidl once a week,\" says Caroline Preece as she wheels a trolleyload of shopping across the car park with her daughter Annabel. \"I like Lidl because they do the brands as well \u2013 and it's a lot cheaper. My brother-in-law lives in Germany and Lidl is his equivalent of Tesco.\" Preece is a Maidstone Mum, the women identified by Lidl UK boss Ronny Gottschlich as key to the retailer's growing success in the UK. But the legions of middle-class women who now shop regularly at the so-called discounters also present a rich seam for political strategists who see them as a possible successor to Mondeo Man or Worcester Woman with the power to tip marginal constituencies in their favour. Alongside rival Aldi, the German chain shot to fame during the recession as bargain-hunting Britons shunned mainstream retailers and started shopping around to save money. But even with the economy kicking into gear, their sales are still motoring ahead as more families do a bigger part of their weekly grocery shop with them. Aldi's sales are currently rising by more than 30% a year and Lidl's by nearly 16%, according to the latest industry data. \"The Maidstone Mum is someone who previously would have thought, 'I can't be seen in a Lidl store',\" says Gottschlich in a recent interview. \"They would have put the Lidl bag into a Marks &amp; Spencer or Waitrose bag. Those Maidstone Mums are no longer afraid of being seen in a Lidl store.\" Together Aldi and Lidl now have higher sales than the Co-op, the country's fifth largest supermarket, and their success is starting to shake the dominance of the traditional \"big four\", Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Food price inflation and anaemic pay rises means food sales are rising at their slowest pace in nearly a decade anyway and the tough environment has magnified the impact of the discounters. Today Tesco's market share \u2013 although still ahead of the competition \u2013 is at its lowest level in a decade while Morrisons recently warned shareholders that profits could halve this year as it ploughs hundreds of millions of pounds into price cuts to halt a shopper exodus. Morrisons boss Dalton Philips has been frank about the sea change in shopper behaviour triggered by the recession and this month said discounters were part of a structural shift in the market as the era of big box supermarkets comes to an end. \"Not since the late 1950s have we seen this change in the market. That was the advent of the supermarket,\" he said. The most recent bloodletting came from Sainsbury's where nine years of growth have come to a halt. Its boss, Justin King, is dismissive of the threat posed by the discounters and blames other factors such as cost-conscious customers buying cheaper own-label goods \u2013 or just buying less. But City experts think the writing is on the wall for the supermarket old guard. On Friday Goldman Sachs published a report suggesting Sainsbury's is only really worth half its near \u00a36bn stock market value and would struggle if the current skirmishes over the price of staples such as milk, bread and eggs escalate into a full blown price war. Analysts point to the march of Aldi and Lidl into more affluent areas. With the smell of baking croissants wafting across Lidl's Maidstone store and a bountiful display of blackberry and redcurrant bushes for gardeners to pore over, shoppers at Aldi and Lidl no longer accept the \"no frills\" stores that once had the hallmarks of a Soviet supermarket. \"They're upping their game,\" says Margaret Izatt, a convert to both Aldi and Lidl. \"There is still a bit of snobbery around \u2013 not only about Lidl but Morrisons as well. I shop there a lot but some of my friends are a bit sniffy about the kind of people who go there. I say, I don't bring them home with me, I bring my groceries home.\" \"I prefer organic and free range food but when it comes to staples you can't do better,\" says Andrea Ray. \"You bring your own bag and feel the benefit in your pocket. Everyone is a bit more sensible now. You can spend hundreds of extra pounds by not being savvy. \" With around 157,000 inhabitants, the Kent town is firmly in the squeezed middle, with the median salary in Maidstone and the Weald \u00a321,985 \u2013 slightly higher than the national figure \u2013 according to the Office for National Statistics. Both local seats are held by Tory MPs \u2013 indeed, Ann Widdecombe was a local MP for 13 years. Census data shows Kent's population jumping 10% \u2013 or 134,000 \u2013 between 2001 and 2011, the biggest increase in the south east. It was even higher in Maidstone itself, at 11.7%, with the increase attributed in part to migration, according to Kent county council. One in four Lidl shoppers are drawn from the AB demographic, says Gottschlich, who points to its upmarket own brand range Deluxe, which includes a whole lobster for \u00a36, as a key draw. \"The recession shone a spotlight on us as a supermarket that offers high-quality products at low prices,\" said Gottschlich. \"It is this low-pricing strategy that continues to draw new middle-class customers \u2013 the Maidstone mums \u2013 into our stores for the first time.\" The same holds true of Aldi. \"Our growth is due to more and more shoppers choosing Aldi for their main weekly shop,\" said Matthew Barnes and Roman Heini, Aldi's joint group managing directors. \"People want to, rather than need to, shop at Aldi.\" Worcester Woman\" was synonymous with suburban prosperity, but Labour MP Caroline Flint says the prolonged consumer downturn has been a struggle for these middle-class, middle England voters. \"Things are tougher than they were for Worcester Woman,\" wrote Flint in an article for New Labour thinktank Progress. \"Her husband probably has not had a pay rise for years \u2026 she has gone back to work or increased her hours to keep pace with the rising cost of living. And even though she still buys most things at the supermarket, she probably tops this up with a trip to the local Aldi. 'Worcester Woman' has become Aldi Mum.\" While voter caricatures such as Mondeo Man capture the zeitgeist, others such as William Hague's \"Pebbledash People\" miss the mark, says Flint. Nonetheless, she says: \"They remind us that parties win elections when they pay attention to voters and their priorities.\" Just as Maidstone or Aldi mums are shaping up as the key battleground for Britain's retailers, they are also likely to be one in the next election.",

      "body": "<p>Supermarket chiefs want her custom and politicians want her vote: meet \"Maidstone Mum\", the swing shopper who is changing the status quo.</p> <p>\"I used to do a Tesco online shop all the time \u2013 now I come to Lidl once a week,\" says Caroline Preece as she wheels a trolleyload of shopping across the car park with her daughter Annabel. \"I like Lidl because they do the brands as well \u2013 and it's a lot cheaper. My brother-in-law lives in Germany and Lidl is his equivalent of Tesco.\"</p> <p>Preece is a Maidstone Mum, the women <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/18/lidl-aldi-growth-rival-uk-supermarkets\" title=\"\">identified by Lidl UK boss Ronny Gottschlich</a> as key to the retailer's growing success in the UK. But the legions of middle-class women who now shop regularly at the so-called discounters also present a rich seam for political strategists who see them as a possible successor to Mondeo Man or Worcester Woman with the power to tip marginal constituencies in their favour.</p> <p>Alongside rival Aldi, the German chain shot to fame during the recession as bargain-hunting Britons shunned mainstream retailers and started shopping around to save money. But even with the economy kicking into gear, their sales are still motoring ahead as more families do a bigger part of their weekly grocery shop with them. Aldi's sales are currently rising by more than 30% a year and Lidl's by nearly 16%, according to the latest industry data.</p> <p>\"The Maidstone Mum is someone who previously would have thought, '<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10486418/Lidl-plans-to-more-than-double-number-of-stores-in-UK.html\" title=\"\">I can't be seen in a Lidl store</a>',\" says Gottschlich in a recent interview. \"They would have put the Lidl bag into a Marks &amp; Spencer or Waitrose bag. Those Maidstone Mums are no longer afraid of being seen in a Lidl store.\"</p> <p>Together Aldi and Lidl now have higher sales than the Co-op, the country's fifth largest supermarket, and their success is starting to shake the dominance of the traditional \"big four\", Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons.</p> <p>Food price inflation and anaemic pay rises means food sales are rising at their slowest pace in nearly a decade anyway and the tough environment has magnified the impact of the discounters. Today Tesco's market share \u2013 although still ahead of the competition \u2013<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/11/tesco-market-share-shrinks-lowest-level-decade-aldi-supermarket\" title=\"\"> is at its lowest level in a decade</a> while Morrisons recently warned shareholders that profits could halve this year as it ploughs hundreds of millions of pounds into price cuts to halt a shopper exodus.</p> <p>Morrisons boss Dalton Philips has been frank about the sea change in shopper behaviour triggered by the recession and this month said discounters were part of a structural shift in the market as the era of big box supermarkets comes to an end. \"Not since the late 1950s have we seen this change in the market. That was the advent of the supermarket,\" he said.</p> <p>The most recent bloodletting came from Sainsbury's where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/18/sainsburys-sales-fall-first-time-nine-years\" title=\"\">nine years of growth have come to a halt.</a> Its boss, Justin King, is dismissive of the threat posed by the discounters and blames other factors such as cost-conscious customers buying cheaper own-label goods \u2013 or just buying less. But City experts think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/19/britain-shoppers-hungry-change-big-grocery\" title=\"\">the writing is on the wall for the supermarket old guard. </a>On Friday Goldman Sachs published a report suggesting Sainsbury's is only really worth half its near \u00a36bn stock market value and would struggle if the current skirmishes over the price of staples such as milk, bread and eggs escalate into a full blown price war.</p> <p>Analysts point to the march of Aldi and Lidl into more affluent areas.</p> <p>With the smell of baking croissants wafting across Lidl's Maidstone store and a bountiful display of blackberry and redcurrant bushes for gardeners to pore over, shoppers at Aldi and Lidl no longer accept the \"no frills\" stores that once had the hallmarks of a Soviet supermarket.</p> <p>\"They're upping their game,\" says Margaret Izatt, a convert to both Aldi and Lidl. \"There is still a bit of snobbery around \u2013 not only about Lidl but Morrisons as well. I shop there a lot but some of my friends are a bit sniffy about the kind of people who go there. I say, I don't bring them home with me, I bring my groceries home.\"</p> <p>\"I prefer organic and free range food but when it comes to staples you can't do better,\" says Andrea Ray. \"You bring your own bag and feel the benefit in your pocket. Everyone is a bit more sensible now. You can spend hundreds of extra pounds by not being savvy. \"</p> <p>With around 157,000 inhabitants, the Kent town is firmly in the squeezed middle, with the median salary in Maidstone and the Weald \u00a321,985 \u2013 slightly higher than the national figure \u2013 according to the Office for National Statistics. Both local seats are held by Tory MPs \u2013 indeed, Ann Widdecombe was a local MP for 13 years. Census data shows Kent's population jumping 10% \u2013 or 134,000 \u2013 between 2001 and 2011, the biggest increase in the south east. It was even higher in Maidstone itself, at 11.7%, with the increase attributed in part to migration, according to Kent county council.</p> <p>One in four Lidl shoppers are drawn from the AB demographic, says Gottschlich, who points to its upmarket own brand range Deluxe, which includes a whole lobster for \u00a36, as a key draw. \"The recession shone a spotlight on us as a supermarket that offers high-quality products at low prices,\" said Gottschlich. \"It is this low-pricing strategy that continues to draw new middle-class customers \u2013 the Maidstone mums \u2013 into our stores for the first time.\"</p> <p>The same holds true of Aldi. \"Our growth is due to more and more shoppers choosing Aldi for their main weekly shop,\" said Matthew Barnes and Roman Heini, Aldi's joint group managing directors. \"People want to, rather than need to, shop at Aldi.\"</p> <p>Worcester Woman\" was synonymous with suburban prosperity, but Labour MP Caroline Flint says the prolonged consumer downturn has been a struggle for these middle-class, middle England voters.</p> <p>\"Things are tougher than they were for Worcester Woman,\" wrote Flint in an <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2013/07/02/how-worcester-woman-became-aldi-mum/\" title=\"\">article for New Labour thinktank Progress.</a> \"Her husband probably has not had a pay rise for years \u2026 she has gone back to work or increased her hours to keep pace with the rising cost of living. And even though she still buys most things at the supermarket, she probably tops this up with a trip to the local Aldi. 'Worcester Woman' has become Aldi Mum.\"</p> <p>While voter caricatures such as Mondeo Man capture the zeitgeist, others such as William Hague's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jan/31/uk.conservatives1\" title=\"\">Pebbledash People</a>\" miss the mark, says Flint. Nonetheless, she says: \"They remind us that parties win elections when they pay attention to voters and their priorities.\"</p> <p>Just as Maidstone or Aldi mums are shaping up as the key battleground for Britain's retailers, they are also likely to be one in the next election.</p>",
