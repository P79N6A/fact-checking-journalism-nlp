      "bodyText": "This past week came the news that Australia\u2019s unemployment rate reached 5.3% \u2013 the lowest point since 2012. Now of course unemployment rates can disguise a lot of problems but in August an equal record level of participation in the workforce was also recorded. So it is not a case that the unemployment rate is low because people are giving up looking for work and thus producing a distorted low number. Yes, full-time employment is not growing as strong as is part-time, but it is still growing solidly. Yes, the underemployment rate of 8.3% remains very high \u2013 and the gap between it and the unemployment rate is larger than it has ever been. But despite this there is little argument that the labour force is doing well \u2013 certainly doing better than at any point in the LNP term of office. And this news came after figures released two weeks ago that show the economy grew faster in the past year than it has since 2012. Now of course wages growth is weak and real household incomes are flat, but any government would gladly have the current GDP and unemployment numbers at its disposal six or seven months out from an election. Last year I suggested that ALP supporters should hold their horses a bit when it came to picking out their election celebration party music playlists. While the government was behind in the polls, the labour force was growing strongly \u2013 stronger in many ways than it had ever done before. In 2017 the percentage of the adult population increased by 1% \u2013 the first time that had happened in a 12-month period since 2005. I was also a bit wary of those from the left predicting a win for the ALP because despite the run of poll victories, the reality is the ALP was not that far in front. While the redistribution of seats did give the ALP an edge, the reality is winning an election from opposition is bloody hard. In the past 50 years, which encompasses all of the post-Menzies period, government at the federal level has changed just six times. And each time the opposition won easily. Whitlam in 1972, Fraser in 1975, Hawke in 1983, Howard in 1996, Rudd in 2007, Abbott in 2013 \u2013 were all elections that saw the commentators on election night saying \u201cthe swing is on and its big\u201d and had the government representatives present on the TV left to mumble about postal votes and keeping the furniture. And yet even up to last month, while the ALP was ahead in the polls, it was nothing like what we saw in 2007 or 2013. The incumbent does tend to win the close elections, especially if the prime minister is not particularly disliked. Malcolm Turnbull was certainly not hated in a way that had you thinking baseball bats were being readied around the nation. Sure, he was hardly a vote winner in Queensland or Western Australia but there was little vitriol. The view of the voters towards him was best described in a tweet by the Australian\u2019s Jon Kudelka who noted early last year: \u201cThe thing with Malcolm is even though you know he is going to be disappointing, he still manages to disappoint, which is quite something.\u201d But it\u2019s all history now. The good economic news, which the government should be able to trumpet from the rooftops, is just a bit of noise that can scarce be heard above the circus that is our federal government. And it is at the heart of why Scott Morrison is unable to come up with a decent reason why he is currently the prime minister, because the economy is pretty much running as the government hoped \u2013 growth and profits are up, wages are low, the budget is likely to be back in surplus faster than expected, possibly the current financial year. So given things are going as planned, why did they need to change leaders? Morrison could answer that a bunch of hard-right conservatives, who never trusted Turnbull because he believed in things like marriage equality and climate change, tore him down purely out of spite. But such a line possibly wouldn\u2019t play well, especially given Morrison seems very much in agreement with their views. He might say he has no blood on his hands but his actions on climate change and his absurd push for increased laws on religious freedom, despite his not being able to name to one problem with the current law, suggest he is very happy to do what the conservative forces want. Over the next half a year we will have this bizarre performance from the government telling us how great things are, and how great they have been and yet with every word they serve to highlight the lunacy of their dumping Turnbull. All the advantage governments get from incumbency during good economic times is now diminished by their own actions. Last year, when I was warning ALP supporters that the election was not in the bag I also suggested \u201cwe should not, however, underestimate the ability of this government to shoot itself in the foot\u201d. And so it has. The old line is that oppositions don\u2019t win election, governments lose them. I don\u2019t think that is particularly true \u2013 there has been many a poor government that could have been turfed had the opposition not been so poor. But it appears the current LNP is doing its best to prove the adage correct. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The Tesco founder, Jack Cohen, was an enterprising market trader who brought modern supermarket retailing to postwar Britain. Nearly a century later, Cohen, nicknamed \u201cSlasher Jack\u201d because he liked to \u201cpile it high and sell it cheap\u201d, is making a high street comeback. On Wednesday, Tesco will unveil Jack\u2019s, a discount chain named after its no-nonsense founder who famously gave top lieutenants tie-pins engraved \u201cYCDBSOYA\u201d \u2013 an abbreviation of \u201cyou can\u2019t do business sitting on your arse\u201d. The closely watched venture is one of the most significant moves by a mainstream UK supermarket chain in recent years, and points to Tesco moving on from the 2014 accounting crisis that brought it to its knees. The unlikely venue for the big reveal is the sleepy market town of Chatteris in Cambridgeshire. The \u00a322m store has been an empty shell since 2014, a victim of the sudden halting of the machine that had underpinned its growth in the 20 years leading up to the accounting scandal. As it finally opens, Chatteris will act as a window to Tesco\u2019s future under its chief executive, Dave Lewis. Bolstered by this year\u2019s \u00a33.7bn takeover of the cash-and-carry chain Booker, Lewis is trying to rebuild profit margins at what was once one of Britain\u2019s most profitable companies. The project has been shielded in secrecy, with visitors to a mock store at Tesco head office in Welwyn Garden City asked to sign confidentiality agreements before entering. As staff worked late filling the shelves of the Chatteris store last week, it was clear the spartan layout had been designed to appeal to shoppers used to the no-frills experience of an Aldi or Lidl. Whereas Aldi has a regular \u201cSuper 6\u201d deal, the signs in Jack\u2019s advertise a \u201cfresh five\u201d offer. Another hoarding promises \u2018\u2018every drop of milk is British\u201d \u2013 again, a nod to the German chains, which have heavily marketed their British sourcing credentials. \u201cThe reason why discounters succeed is not just because they are cheap,\u201d says Bryan Roberts, an analyst at TCC Global. \u201cThe food is high quality and it\u2019s simple to shop. You don\u2019t have to choose between 15 types of ketchup; you choose between two.\u201d Tesco is dipping its toe in the fast-growing discount market at a time of huge upheaval in the UK\u2019s \u00a3117bn grocery market. The competition watchdog is agonising over the proposed \u00a312bn merger between Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda, which would create a retailer more powerful than Tesco. A tie-up between the UK\u2019s second- and third-largest supermarket chains would previously have been unthinkable but for the rise of Aldi and Lidl, whose sales are growing at 10% a year. Their low prices have forced down those of the major chains and eaten away at profits. The scale of shopper defections means that \u00a37bn less is being spent annually with the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 than a decade ago. To retaliate, Tesco has replaced its cheapest own-label products with the generic \u201cfarm\u201d brands and ersatz ranges such as Bay Fishmongers, Ms Molly\u2019s and Butcher\u2019s Choice, which could also be sold in Jack\u2019s. But some senior industry executives wonder why, given the extra buying power created by the takeover of Booker, which boosts group sales to \u00a360bn, Tesco needs a discount brand. \u201cAre they effectively raising the white flag?\u201d asks one former supermarket boss. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Tesco compete with Aldi and Lidl? Will Tesco now be a more expensive alternative, albeit with a bigger range? \u201cSupermarkets have always been discounters since they were brought here from the US after the war. The self-service model was all about lower costs and cheaper prices. Why can\u2019t Tesco be a discounter rather than launching Jack\u2019s? It just gives Aldi and Lidl affirmation and legitimacy.\u201d Time has not stood still in Chatteris and in the intervening years an Aldi store, one of nearly 800 in the UK, has opened and built a clientele. Tellingly, it emerged when Tesco decided to mothball the store that locals had expressed a preference for an Asda or a Morrisons in the first place. In the 90s and 00s, the big supermarket chains engaged in a \u201cspace race\u201d, competing to open the most supermarkets. Under Terry Leahy that race was won emphatically by Tesco as it shape-shifted into tiny convenience stores and the huge department-store-style Extras. Leahy\u2019s legacy is an unparalleled 2,659 UK stores, but these days some of them \u2013 particularly within the 172-strong Metro chain of small supermarkets \u2013 are feeling their age on ailing high streets where the discounters are their new neighbours. The Shore Capital analyst Clive Black says the Jack\u2019s format could give 100 Tesco stores a fresh lease of life. Jack\u2019s could also be deployed in eastern Europe, where Tesco operates, but is also under attack from discounters, he suggests. \u201cThis is about a group of problem UK stores: whether it turns out to be something more material, time will tell,\u201d he says. It\u2019s not the first time that a mainstream supermarket has tried to be a discounter as well. Sainsbury\u2019s co-opened stores with the Danish chain Netto in 2014 only to shut them two years later after struggling to make a profit. Asda briefly experimented with the Asda Essentials chain of small outlets. Analysts say Jack\u2019s will only succeed if it is run at an arm\u2019s length from the mothership. \u201cBeing a discounter is about turning efficiency into scale and the lowest possible prices and highest possible quality for shoppers,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cYou can\u2019t play at being a discounter. If you try and do it alongside the main brand and there\u2019s overlap, shoppers will notice.\u201d",

To retaliate, Tesco has replaced its cheapest own-label products with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/21/tesco-revamps-own-label-range-fight-discounters-aldi-lidl\" title=\"\">generic \u201cfarm\u201d brands</a> and ersatz ranges such as Bay Fishmongers, Ms Molly\u2019s and Butcher\u2019s Choice, which could also be sold in Jack\u2019s.</p> <p>But some senior industry executives wonder why, given the extra buying power created by the takeover of Booker, which boosts group sales to \u00a360bn, Tesco needs a discount brand.</p> <p>\u201cAre they effectively raising the white flag?\u201d asks one former supermarket boss. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Tesco compete with Aldi and Lidl? Will Tesco now be a more expensive alternative, albeit with a bigger range?</p> <p>\u201cSupermarkets have always been discounters since they were brought here from the US after the war. The self-service model was all about lower costs and cheaper prices. Why can\u2019t Tesco be a discounter rather than launching Jack\u2019s? It just gives Aldi and Lidl affirmation and legitimacy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2018-09-13T17:14:27/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Supermarkets' market share\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2018-09-13T17:14:27/embed.html\">Supermarkets' market share</a> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Time has not stood still in Chatteris and in the intervening years an Aldi store, one of nearly 800 in the UK, has opened and built a clientele. Tellingly, it emerged when Tesco decided to mothball the store that locals had expressed a preference for an Asda or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons\" title=\"\">Morrisons</a> in the first place.</p> <p>In the 90s and 00s, the big supermarket chains engaged in a \u201cspace race\u201d, competing to open the most supermarkets. Under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/25/tesco-sir-terry-leahy-retires\" title=\"\">Terry Leahy</a> that race was won emphatically by Tesco as it shape-shifted into tiny convenience stores and the huge department-store-style Extras. Leahy\u2019s legacy is an unparalleled 2,659 UK stores, but these days some of them \u2013 particularly within the 172-strong Metro chain of small supermarkets \u2013 are feeling their age on ailing high streets where the discounters are their new neighbours.</p> <p>The Shore Capital analyst Clive Black says the Jack\u2019s format could give 100 Tesco stores a fresh lease of life. Jack\u2019s could also be deployed in eastern Europe, where Tesco operates, but is also under attack from discounters, he suggests. \u201cThis is about a group of problem UK stores: whether it turns out to be something more material, time will tell,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the first time that a mainstream supermarket has tried to be a discounter as well. Sainsbury\u2019s co-opened stores with the Danish chain Netto in 2014 only to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/04/netto-uk-stores-to-close-as-sainsburys-calls-time-on-joint-venture\" title=\"\">shut them </a>two years later after struggling to make a profit. Asda briefly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/mar/31/supermarkets.asda\" title=\"\">experimented with the Asda Essentials chain</a> of small outlets.</p> <p>Analysts say Jack\u2019s will only succeed if it is run at an arm\u2019s length from the mothership. \u201cBeing a discounter is about turning efficiency into scale and the lowest possible prices and highest possible quality for shoppers,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cYou can\u2019t play at being a discounter. If you try and do it alongside the main brand and there\u2019s overlap, shoppers will notice.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s biggest national infrastructure projects in decades is coming off the rails, according to a welter of criticism from politicians, consumer groups and media outlets. The target of the carping is not the HS2 railway project or Heathrow runway expansion, but the government\u2019s requirement for energy suppliers to offer all homes and businesses a smart meter by the end of 2020. The meters automate readings, encourage saving by showing consumption in pounds and pence, and should put an end to billing problems. Industry and government both argue that they are vital for helping the UK\u2019s electricity grid cope with an increasing but variable amount of wind and solar power. They could also reduce the need for costly upgrades to power grids, aid integration of electric cars into the energy system and open up a host of innovative tariffs where energy costs vary based on time of use. In short, they are seen as a essential foundation for much of the UK\u2019s energy future. But this summer saw calls for their rollout to be halted because of problems occurring after customers switch. A downbeat report by the British Infrastructure Group \u2013 a parliamentary body run by the former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps \u2013 topped the news bulletins. Separately, statistics released in August showed that the rollout has lost momentum at exactly the time it should be speeding up. About 1.25 million smart meters were fitted in the second quarter of 2018, up just 1% on the previous quarter. Installations have only just passed the 13 million mark \u2013 a long way from the 53 million there would be if every household and business had one. Embarrassingly, about 940,000 have lost their smart functionality after people switched supplier \u2013 meaning consumers once again have to manually submit readings. The figures prompted the consumer group Citizens Advice, which recently called for the 2020 deadline to be delayed to 2023, to declare that energy suppliers would have to work at an \u201cincreasingly unrealistic pace\u201d to complete the rollout. However, advocates argue that, far from coming off the rails, the project is actually, finally, coming of age. This was meant to be the year that most of the programme\u2019s problems were fixed by energy suppliers switching from fitting first-generation meters, known as Smets1, to second-generation Smets2 units. Technical problems with the newer ones have meant the government has had to repeatedly push back the cut-off date for installing Smets1 meters. However, those problems appear to have finally been solved. The Observer can reveal there are now more than 30,000 Smets2 meters installed in homes and businesses across the country \u2013 a rapid acceleration from a total of just 1,000 in June. About 1,000 are now being fitted each day. British Gas, the UK\u2019s biggest energy supplier, has fitted more than 5,000. Smaller suppliers, which have been waiting for Smets2 units, say they are starting to install them at pace. Robert Cheesewright, director of policy and communications at Smart Energy GB, the body set up to promote smart meters, said the arrival of Smets2 meters in homes was \u201can important milestone\u201d. The programme should get a further boost from November, when the first-generation meters\u2019 problem of losing smart functionality after switching suppliers starts to be fixed. That will involve an over-the-air patch to \u201cenrol\u201d them into a central body handling the meter data, which is run by the outsourcing firm Capita. Angus Flett, chief executive of that body \u2013 the Data Communications Company \u2013 said it had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d. Still, there is little doubt among industry watchers that the rollout remains behind schedule. Alan Whitehead, the shadow energy minister, said: \u201cThe car hasn\u2019t actually crashed yet, but all the signs of a big accident are around us.\u201d Whitehead said he believed that the 2020 target would be missed but did not want to see the technology ditched. \u201cWe really shouldn\u2019t contemplate a future where we simply abandon smart meters and continue with old analogue meters.\u201d James Heappey, Conservative MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary Clean Energy Group, said installation of the older meters should continue in the short term, despite their problems, to stop the rollout from faltering. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t argue in favour of a hiatus, because then the momentum is lost,\u201d he said. A spokesperson at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cMore than 400,000 smart meters are being installed every month, helping people to take control of their energy use and save money on their bills. \u201cEveryone who wants a smart meter will get one by the end of 2020.\u201d",
