      "bodyText": "BHS is battling to raise \u00a3100m to pay staff wages and continue trading, with 10,000 jobs at risk at the struggling department store chain. The retailer is still trying to obtain emergency funding almost four weeks after creditors approved a survival plan that involved landlords accepting deep cuts to the rent on stores. BHS denied speculation on Friday night that it was on the brink of falling into administration. A spokesman said it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d at the company and it was \u201con track\u201d with talks over funding. Meanwhile, another 1,000 jobs are also understood to be risk at Austin Reed, the 116-year-old tailoring brand, which could call in administrators as early as next week. The retailer, founded in 1900 by Austin Leonard Reed and famous for its suits and shirts, is understood to have filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators on Wednesday and has lined up insolvency experts AlixPartners to advise. The notice gives Austin Reed, which also owns the Viyella and CC (previously Country Casuals) fashion brands, 10 working days to resolve its financial problems before tipping into administration. It is understood to be looking for a potential buyer. BHS was due to announce a \u00a360m loan this week from Gordon Brothers, the private equity firm. However, talks over the loan are thought to be complex. Sir Philip Green, who used to own BHS, needs to release security he holds over BHS assets in order for the loan to go through, while the Pension Protection Fund is also in talks with the chain over its \u00a3571m pension deficit. The 88-year-old retailer, which has 164 stores, had won a stay of execution after landlords, suppliers and other creditors backed a deal that involved landlords accepting cuts to their rent of up to 75% on 87 BHS shops. However, the company warned it still needed to raise \u00a3100m to pay staff wages and rent and to fund a vital turnaround plan. Green sold BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015 to a little-known collection of financiers, lawyers and accountants, led by Dominic Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt twice. When the deal with landlords was approved, chief executive Darren Topp said he wanted the British public to give BHS a \u201csecond chance\u201d. He said: \u201cWe want to make it an iconic British brand again. We would like the British public to give us a second chance. Come and see our stores and you will be surprised.\u201d But Topp is understood to have called an emergency board meeting this month after some of the proceeds from the sale of BHS\u2019s property went to the consortium of owners \u2013 known as Retail Acquisitions \u2013 instead of the struggling retailer itself. BHS sold its Oxford Street store for \u00a355m and its Sunderland brand for \u00a32.2m, with the proceeds becoming part of its \u00a3100m financial package. However, \u00a3600,000 of the Oxford Street deal and \u00a3440,000 from the Sunderland deal went to Retail Acquisitions. The consortium said the payments were in accordance with the management services agreement between BHS and Retail Acquisitions. Austin Reed, whose customers included Winston Churchill and Elizabeth Taylor in its heyday, has struggled in recent years and, in 2015, used a company voluntary agreement to shutter 31 unprofitable stores. It also moved out of its vast London flagship at 113 Regent Street in 2011, exchanging it for smaller premises over the road, but it is now trying to sell that store as well. Alteri Investors, an American hedge fund, took control of the company last week. Alteri recently bought the business from Darius Capital, a group controlled by property tycoon Guy Naggar, who was previously involved in the now collapsed investment company Dawnay Day.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David and Samantha Cameron enjoy a curry. They tucked into chicken korai and saag paneer at Manchester\u2019s Saffron Lounge during the Conservative party conference in October \u2013 it wasn\u2019t quite as spicy as the chilli-hot specials they ordered at the Paprika Indian restaurant in Birmingham the previous year. The prime minister even pledged to protect the struggling \u00a34.2bn curry industry, which employs 100,000 people, at the British Curry awards in 2013. He said he would \u201cget the skilled Asian chefs you need\u201d to the UK, while the home secretary, Theresa May, has admitted that curry chefs are a shortage occupation. This shortage has been caused by increasingly tough immigration rules, so that restaurants are unable to hire the skilled chefs they need. This makes it difficult for these businesses to grow, while restaurants are unable to provide adequate customer service levels or fulfil orders. If the problem was acute when Cameron made that pledge, it is now a full-blown crisis. Around 600 curry restaurants have closed in the past 18 months, while there are fears that a further 4,000 \u2013 about a third of the industry \u2013 could shut. The shortage of chefs means they demand increasingly high wages. Dr Wali Uddin, who owns the Britannia Spice in Edinburgh, says a chef\u2019s pay packet has doubled in the last two years, and is now up to \u00a3700-800 a week. \u201cUsually I had seven chefs, but now just three,\u201d says Uddin. \u201cThere are not enough chefs, so we can\u2019t grow.\u201d Alun Sperring, owner of the Chilli Pickle in Brighton, says chefs are now demanding free accommodation, which is \u201ctotally unfeasible\u201d. He adds that bringing over a highly trained chef from Asia for a short stint adds \u201cauthenticity\u201d to the cuisine and inspires the other staff. Imam Uddin, president of the Guild of Bangladeshi Restaurateurs in Staffordshire, said Indian restaurants were closing down at a rate of one or two a week in the West Midlands. \u201cThere are lots of restaurants up for sale, but nobody\u2019s buying. It\u2019s pretty bad. They can\u2019t deliver the service they intend to, which ultimately leads to under-trading and, eventually, closure.\u201d Restaurateurs, led by the British Curry Awards founder Enam Ali, are now pushing the government to ease immigration restrictions. A 75-page document, seen by the Guardian, that Ali and his supporters have submitted to Cameron, May, the employment minister Priti Patel and business secretary Sajid Javid, is now urging them to introduce a one-year visa for chefs from sub-continental Asia. If this plan isn\u2019t adopted, warns Ali, it could hurt the Conservatives in elections. Until 2005 there was a sector-based visa scheme that let curry restaurants fly in skilled staff, but this was closed amid allegations that it was abused by immigrants who wanted to settle in the UK permanently. Current immigration rules stipulate that a chef from outside the UK must be paid \u00a329,570, after deductions for accommodation and meals, which is too expensive for most curry restaurants. Moreover, the jobs cannot be in a restaurant with a takeaway service, which most curry houses rely upon. Ali\u2019s submission states: \u201cWe propose a tightly controlled, temporary work visa scheme where expert chefs from outside the EU are allowed to enter the UK on very strict employment terms. These terms would limit their employment to a maximum of one-year with no right of return, no chance of residency or out-of-work benefits. \u201cEmployment would be restricted to the sponsoring restaurant only and would require the employer to provide private health insurance. The employee\u2019s dependents could not be brought to the UK and this means there would be no burden whatever on the welfare state or the British taxpayer. This type of short-term visa is similar to those used in the USA, Germany and the Middle East.\u201d But there appears to be significant opposition within the government to relaxing the rules. In a recent letter to his fellow MP Stephen Hammond, the immigration minister James Brokenshire stated: \u201cThe restaurant industry, like others, needs to move away from an unsustainable reliance on migrant workers.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe continue to welcome the very top chefs who promote innovative and authentic cuisine here in the UK \u2014 and these type of skilled cooks are on the shortage occupation list.\u201d The minimum required salary for chefs on the shortage occupation list is \u00a329,570. However, the spokesperson added: \u201cWe want to nurture more home-grown talent and encourage young people in this country who want to pursue a skilled career. This means the restaurant sector offering training to attract and recruit resident workers to meet their staffing needs. \u201cThe industry is starting to make progress in this area, recruiting and training more chefs in the UK, and this needs to continue.\u201d Ali warns: \u201cPeople right across the country are angry about this \u2013 and the Asian community will very genuinely show that at the ballot box.\u201d The industry changed dramatically around the turn of the millennium. The first generation of Asian families who set up businesses in the 1960s and 70s were not always skilled chefs, but had spotted a gap in the restaurant market. Jalf Ali, who pioneered Indian street food in the UK, owns two restaurants in Newcastle and says it took decades for the British palate to \u201cmature\u201d. Restaurateurs then hired chefs skilled in more sophisticated cuisine. \u201cThe British were ready for real Indian food rather than the bastardised rogans and we had to get these chefs who had the knowledge and regional cooking understanding,\u201d says Ali. The government is wrong, he adds, to insist that Indian restaurants should rely on domestic or EU labour. Ali points to a Slovakian he trained who, even after four and a half years, only had the skills to work in one area of the kitchen where he would marinate tandoori dishes and make bread. \u201cI would never think about opening another restaurant because what\u2019s the point? I can\u2019t build the team,\u201d says Ali.",

If this plan isn\u2019t adopted, warns Ali, it could hurt the Conservatives in elections.</p> <p>Until 2005 there was a sector-based visa scheme that let curry restaurants fly in skilled staff, but this was closed amid allegations that it was abused by immigrants who wanted to settle in the UK permanently. </p> <p>Current immigration rules stipulate that a chef from outside the UK must be paid \u00a329,570, after deductions for accommodation and meals, which is too expensive for most curry restaurants. Moreover, the jobs cannot be in a restaurant with a takeaway service, which most curry houses rely upon.</p> <p>Ali\u2019s submission states: \u201cWe propose a tightly controlled, temporary work visa scheme where expert chefs from outside the EU are allowed to enter the UK on very strict employment terms. These terms would limit their employment to a maximum of one-year with no right of return, no chance of residency or out-of-work benefits.</p> <p>\u201cEmployment would be restricted to the sponsoring restaurant only and would require the employer to provide private health insurance. The employee\u2019s dependents could not be brought to the UK and this means there would be no burden whatever on the welfare state or the British taxpayer. This type of short-term visa is similar to those used in the USA, Germany and the Middle East.\u201d</p> <p>But there appears to be significant opposition within the government to relaxing the rules. In a recent letter to his fellow MP Stephen Hammond, the immigration minister James Brokenshire stated: \u201cThe restaurant industry, like others, needs to move away from an unsustainable reliance on migrant workers.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe continue to welcome the very top chefs who promote innovative and authentic cuisine here in the UK \u2014 and these type of skilled cooks are on the shortage occupation list.\u201d</p> <p>The minimum required salary for chefs on the shortage occupation list is \u00a329,570.</p> <p>However, the spokesperson added: \u201cWe want to nurture more home-grown talent and encourage young people in this country who want to pursue a skilled career. This means the restaurant sector offering training to attract and recruit resident workers to meet their staffing needs.</p> <p>\u201cThe industry is starting to make progress in this area, recruiting and training more chefs in the UK, and this needs to continue.\u201d</p> <p>Ali warns: \u201cPeople right across the country are angry about this \u2013 and the Asian community will very genuinely show that at the ballot box.\u201d</p> <p>The industry changed dramatically around the turn of the millennium. The first generation of Asian families who set up businesses in the 1960s and 70s were not always skilled chefs, but had spotted a gap in the restaurant market.</p> <p>Jalf Ali, who pioneered Indian street food in the UK, owns two restaurants in Newcastle and says it took decades for the British palate to \u201cmature\u201d. Restaurateurs then hired chefs skilled in more sophisticated cuisine.</p> <p>\u201cThe British were ready for real Indian food rather than the bastardised rogans and we had to get these chefs who had the knowledge and regional cooking understanding,\u201d says Ali.</p> <p>The government is wrong, he adds, to insist that Indian restaurants should rely on domestic or EU labour. Ali points to a Slovakian he trained who, even after four and a half years, only had the skills to work in one area of the kitchen where he would marinate tandoori dishes and make bread.</p> <p>\u201cI would never think about opening another restaurant because what\u2019s the point? I can\u2019t build the team,\u201d says Ali. </p>",

The giveaway reflects the most dismal shipping conditions in decades, caused by economic slowdown in China combined with an oversupply of vessels due to a building spree during a previous boom. The Greek owners are looking for buyers for two remaining vessels and are taking Goldenport off the stock market, saying it no longer makes sense to list shares which have dropped from highs of \u00a350 in 2007 to less than 1.5p. John Dragnis, the chief executive of Goldenport, said the company\u2019s lenders and shareholders had agreed to the fleet sell-off at a time when the company had debts of more than \u00a3100m to RBS and other banks. \u201cThe value of the vessels is less than the value of the loans due to extreme market conditions.\u201d He added: \u201cDry bulk vessels generally have fallen in value by around 60% over the last year partly because of extreme oversupply and partly because of low demand for coal as China moves towards renewable energy to curb [carbon] emissions.\u201d Dragnis said family and management controlled almost 60% of Goldenport and had suffered along with all other shareholders from the downturn. The Athens-based shipowner declined to predict when market conditions might pick up although he thought it could be between one and three years. Goldenport would continue as a private company but admitted in a statement to the stock market that its cash reserves had been \u201cdrained\u201d. It added: \u201cThe prevailing market conditions are probably the worst of the last 30 years with the Baltic Dry Index dropping to historic lows, and average daily hire rates falling below even a vessel\u2019s daily operating expenses.\u201d The six ships already sold have been transferred to the ownership of small companies owned by the Dragnis family which originally set up Goldenport and brought the company to the stock market. The announcement of plans to float in 2006, when the shipping markets were riding high on China\u2019s fast-tracked industrialisation programme, boasted of the value to come. Goldenport was active, it said, in two main segments of the international shipping market, containers and dry bulk \u201cenhancing stability of revenue streams\u201d. It added that there would be \u201chighly predictable cash flows due to long term contractual arrangements with large established charter counterparties\u201d. The boom before 2005 encouraged shipbuilding \u2013 particularly in China \u2013 but caused huge overcapacity as the market turned to bust after 2012. All but one of the Goldenport vessels themselves were built in 2010 and 2011. Richard Fulford-Smith, the founder of the Affinity shipbroking firm and a leading figure in the London maritime scene, said the bulk shipping markets were in \u201ca sad state\u201d and there could be more bankruptcies and exits before any bounce back. Fulford-Smith, 60, added: \u201cI will probably be retired by the time there is any real recovery.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Greece has come a step closer to unlocking more international support for its debt-ravaged economy after talks with its eurozone neighbours. A meeting of finance ministers from the single currency bloc ended with a proposal for Athens to agree to money-saving contingency measures. These could be enacted if the reforms already agreed prove to be insufficient for Greece to meet agreed budget surplus targets. Greece clinched an \u20ac86bn (\u00a367bn) bailout last summer \u2013 its third such package of emergency loans \u2013 in return for promising to reduce its deficit with measures such as higher VAT rates and pension cuts. It now urgently needs more funds to be disbursed from that bailout as big repayment deadlines approach on some of its bonds. But eurozone policymakers and the International Monetary Fund have been at odds over whether Greece can achieve agreed fiscal targets \u2013 including a primary surplus on public finances of 3.5% by 2018. The IMF is sceptical that the goal can be reached without extra reforms. The Fund also wants the European Union to provide significant debt relief for Greece before getting behind the country\u2019s third bailout package. There were signs of breakthrough at talks in Amsterdam on Friday where lenders called on Greece to pass extra measures into law as an insurance policy \u2013 only to be enacted if budget goals appear off target. Those contingency plans, equivalent to 2% of GDP, should allow Greece and its lenders to discuss debt relief while also unlocking further chunks of bailout money yet to be disbursed. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and leader of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, said that after talks in Amsterdam, Greece would go away and work both on a possible upfront package of measures, as well as a package of contingent measures. The Eurogroup would then probably meet again on Thursday next week, to discuss the proposed measures and there would also be a \u201cserious conversation\u201d about a debt relief package for Greece, he said. He was upbeat on progress being made between now and Thursday. \u201cWe will all have to bridge our differences. For some of course, the contingency measures are difficult, and for some debt is a big issue, politically difficult,\u201d Dijsselbloem said. \u201cBut on all sides it was very constructive today and there was an open attitude to cross that bridge.\u201d The Dutch minister said that \u201cin order for the contingency measures to be credible, they need to be legislated\u201d and the IMF also said it wanted to see them passed into law. But Greece itself raised doubts about meeting those demands. The Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, told journalists it would not be possible to legislate for contingency measures, because Greek law would not allow it. He said Greece and its lenders would instead have to find \u201ca commitment mechanism\u201d. Figures from the European statistics body Eurostat this week showed that Greece had achieved a better-than-expected primary budget surplus last year. That prompted the country\u2019s leftwing government under its prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to argue again for debt relief over new austerity measures. Diego Iscaro, senior economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said those budget figures had emboldened Athens in its claims that it could be trusted on getting the deficit down. But Iscaro expected the current negotiations between Greece and its official creditors to remain difficult. Last year\u2019s outcome would not change things dramatically \u201cas the IMF\u2019s main concern is the long-term sustainability of Greece\u2019s debt levels\u201d, he said.",

On that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. And here is some video of the opening remarks from Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem at the Ecofin press conference. And with that the press conference is over. Meanwhile Dijsselbloem has tweeted more on the Panama Papers: Quesionts, and one on the Greek situation and the need to legislate any contingency measures, which the Greeks had said is not possible. Dijsselbloem said the institutions will work with the Greek authorities to design the contingency measures. They need to be credible. [There was mention of a fourth bailout]. Dijsselbloem said this is not about a fourth bailout. This is about if the [proposed] measures do not deliver. \u201cWhen I look at the latest figures, the Greeks are on track, it is an extra security package. If there are legal constraints, we will design it in a way that delivers... and needs to be legally possible of course.\u201d Klaas Knot of De Nederlandsche Bank talked of low carbon economy. Discussed how to help consumers in their decisions by increasing transparency. Essential that adequate price incentives are available. Better disclosure of climate exposure is needed. Stress testing should be introduced [in a co-ordinated way]. This could be taken up, for example, by the European systemic risk board. Working to get agreement on anti-tax avoidance, hope for agreement in May, says Dijsselbloem. Also list of non-co-operative jurisdictions. On money laundering, focus was on terrorist funding, now want more on beneficial ownership and others. Ministers was speedy implementation of transparency, including Panama. Panama Papers gave another boost to our agenda to tackle tax evasion and money laundering. Clear view that Europe should lead. Secondly they discussed strengthening the banking union, with differing views on how to achieve it. Finally, Panama Papers. Hadn\u2019t initially intended to discuss it. They were also discussed in G20 and last week the G5 took initiative on information on ultimate ownership. (As George Osborne said earlier ) 28 others joined it, which is a great outcome says Dijsselbloem. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem said duing lunch, finance ministers discussed the EU budget, and how the financail framework could better respond to unforeseen events. He mentions in particular the response to challenges like the migration crisis. The Econfin briefing has just begun and can be seen here. A combination of factors has helped push markets lower as the trading week ends, with mixed data from Europe and the US, mining shares lower as metals come under pressure again and the continuing repercussions of the car emissions scandal. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 71 points or 1.11% to 6310 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.6% to 10,373.49 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.29% lower at 4569.66 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.25% to 18,687.04 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.39% at 9232.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.2% to 605.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15%. Meanwhile Brent crude is up 2.36% at $45.58 a barrel. The damage done to Volkswagen from the emissions scandal has been revealed in its full year results. Julia Kollewe writes: Volkswagen has slumped to its first annual loss in more than 20 years after making a \u20ac16.2bn (\u00a312.6bn) provision for costs relating to the diesel emissions scandal. This pushed VW into an operating loss of \u20ac4.1bn for 2015, bigger than analysts had expected and the company\u2019s first annual loss since 1993, after a \u20ac12.7bn profit in 2014. The company more than doubled its provision for fixing diesel cars to \u20ac16.2bn, a day after announcing plans for the biggest car buyback in history in the US, potentially almost 500,000 vehicles, as part of a deal with the State Department to halt more than 600 class action civil suits. VW said the provision related to the emissions scandal, \u201camong other things for pending technical modifications and customer-related measures as well as global legal risks\u201d. The German carmaker stunned the world when it admitted last September that it had installed software in diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests \u2013 potentially affecting a total of 11m cars worldwide. Chief executive Matthias M\u00fcller said: \u201cThe current crisis \u2013 as the figures presented today also reveal \u2013 is having a huge impact on Volkswagen\u2019s financial position. Yet we have the firm intention and the means to handle the difficult situation we are in using our own resources.\u201d The full story is here: Here\u2019s our full story on the new \u00a320 banknote: The artist chosen to appear on the next \u00a320 banknote has been revealed by Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Carney unveiled the winner, chosen after the public nominated a number of artists to appear, at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. Appropriately, it was J M W Turner who will appear on the note, which will enter circulation by 2020. UK chancellor George Osborne has been tweeting about new measures agreed to improve tax transparency: Meanwhile on the currency markets the pound has moved sharply higher after a number of polls gave a lead to the Remain campaign in the EU referendum. Sterling rose by more than half a per cent to $1.4425 and added 0.7% to hit a four week high against the euro. The pound rose 2.3% to a three week high against the yen, helped by the Japanese currency coming under pressure following reports the Bank of Japan was considering expanding its negative interest rate policy to bank loans, and could even cut rates further. Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe has told the Evening Standard that UK rates could theoretically go negative. As part of a profile of the Bank\u2019s newest rate-setter, the subject of interest rates comes up: But could the Bank of England follow the example of others by cutting interest rates into negative territory if necessary? Vlieghe\u2019s answer is intriguing: \u201cTheoretically, I think interest rates could go a little bit negative.\u201d He says that the Bank would \u201chave to think very carefully\u201d about whether the positive effects would outweigh the downside \u2014 as in Switzerland, for example, where mortgage rates went up. He adds, however: \u201cEven if you are willing theoretically to consider negative interest rates, there is only so far that they can go negative before you start worrying about the thing that central bankers have been worrying about all these years \u2014 which is \u2018not only am I not getting any interest paid on my money in the bank, it is now potentially going to charge me, in which case I won\u2019t keep my money in the bank, I\u2019ll just take it out and keep it at home\u2019. Once that happens, that is almost certainly negative for the economy because then you undermine the whole bank funding model... so we want to stay well away from that scenario.\u201d How deep into negative territory could rates go? That depends on the costs to large companies of storing, transporting and insuring huge piles of cash themselves, he argues. \u201cPeople have tried to come up with how much it costs to do that. I\u2019ve seen estimates in the range of anything from 0.75% and up. Once you start thinking about rates 0.75% negative, companies are going to start taking that seriously. I think the switching point is somewhere around minus 0.5%, minus 0.75%, maybe minus 1%. But I\u2019m also saying I don\u2019t even want to get close to it because I don\u2019t know exactly where it is.\u201d Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: A below expectations performance by US manufacturing will be cause for concern, particularly among those who had predicted the sector was heading towards growth. Optimists pointed to last month\u2019s uptick in new orders as a sign of resurgence. However, pressure from a strong dollar and an uncertain business outlook ahead of a turbulent presidential race appear to be taking their toll. The challenge for Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed will be to build some momentum for a sector which has stubbornly avoided significant growth in recent months. Over to the US, and some weak manufacturing data for April. The Markit initial reading of the months\u2019s manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest for just over six and a half years, down from 51.5 in March to 50.8 and lower than the 52 level analysts had expected. Markit said production volumes were close to stagnation amid a slowdown in new business growth, and there was the weakest rise in manufacturing employment since June 2013. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: US factories reported their worst month for just over six-and-a-half years in April, dashing hopes that first quarter weakness will prove temporary. Survey measures of output and order book backlogs are down to their lowest since the height of the global financial crisis, prompting employers to cut back on their hiring. The survey data are broadly consistent with manufacturing output falling at an annualised rate of over 2% at the start of the second quarter, and factory employment dropping at a rate of 10,000 jobs per month. With prior months\u2019 survey data pointing to annualized GDP growth of just 0.7% in the first quarter, the deteriorating performance of manufacturing suggests that growth could weaken closer towards stagnation in the second quarter. The survey responses reveal an increase in business uncertainty in relation to both the economic and political outlook during the month, which is weighing on spending and investment decisions and exacerbating already-weak demand both at home and abroad. US investors are in cautious mood in early trading. Dow Jones: -0.07% at 17,969.61 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,086.71 Nasdaq: -0.9% at 4,899.89 Welsh billionaire Sir Terry Matthews said he might be willing to put some of his own money into a management buyout of Tata\u2019s UK business and the Port Talbot steelworks. The Guardian\u2019s Graham Ruddick reports: Matthews said he is \u201cfeeling really good\u201d about the prospects of a rescue deal for the steel business, which could save thousands of jobs in the UK. Matthews, who made his fortune in technology and telecoms, is part of a consortium of public and private sector figures from south Wales supporting a management buyout. The tycoon said the consortium is still putting its team together and its funding has yet to be finalised, but that he is ready to back the buyout. \u201cIf it makes sensible business and the future looks really good, frankly there will be investors and we already know it,\u201d he told BBC Wales. \u201cPotentially me too. The fact is, you first put a really good team together, then you fight in an area which has upside. So I am feeling pretty good about it.\u201d Here is a summary of the main messages coming out of the Eurogroup meeting on Greece. Progress has been made on reaching an agreed package of Greek reforms and a Greek debt deal. Greece and its lenders are \u201cvery close\u201d to reaching a deal on an \u201cupfront\u201d package of measures, worth 3% of GDP. Eurogroup also wants Greece to come up with a package of contingency measures, equivalent to 2% of GDP, as an insurance policy if Greece needs to do more to reach its targets. The IMF would like the contingency plans to be legislated for, to give them credibility. However, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos told journalists it would not be possible to legislate for contingency measures, because Greek law would not allow it. He said Greece and its lenders would instead have to find \u201ca commitment mechanism\u201d. Greece and its lenders are going to work on a deal over the next few days. If sufficient progress has been made, Eurogroup ministers will meet again on Thursday next week. The IMF is ready to dispatch its team back to Athens, to work with Greek officials. Now that the Eurogroup meeting is over, finance ministers have disappeared into the Econfin meeting (which includes all EU ministers, not just those from the eurozone). The Panama Papers and EU budget are among the items on the agenda. Assurances from the Eurogroup that a deal on Greek reform measures and debt is close has done nothing to cheer investors. Most European markets are still down. HSBC escapes a major revolt over executive pay: The Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, has thrown a bit of a spanner in the works over these contingency measures. In a separate press conference, he told journalists that within Greek law, there is no possibility of legislating for something that might or might not happen in the future. Dijsselbloem however seemed adamant the contingency measures would have to be legislated... Tsakalotos said that while Greece won\u2019t be able to legislate on contingencies, it will engage with the Europeans to find \u201ca commitment mechanism\u201d on measures so that credibility and trust is achieved. He seemed broadly upbeat after the meeting: We essentially agreed on the package that was discussed last summer. There are a few technical details left to discuss over the next two days but there wasn\u2019t anybody in that room who challenged the idea that that package hasn\u2019t been done. Any solution will have to meet two criteria. The first is that within Greek law, you cannot legislate contingently. You cannot say you will do \u201cx\u201d if the state of the world, \u201cy\u201d, is in place in 2018 or 2019. And the second criterium is whatever solution we find over the next few days must be credible to the creditors, to investors...and to the Greek people. Whatever solution we arrive at will be done so together with the debt. It is absolutely crucial for us that the whole package on debt and reform gives a clear signal to Greek citizens and to European citizens, and to Greek and international investors, that Greece has turned a corner, that there is a clear runway of exiting the crisis. Greek bond yields have fallen following the Eurogroup meeting, on hopes that Greece is close to agreeing a deal with its lenders. Two year yields fell 52 basis points to 10.46%, while benchmark 10-year yields nudged down by 14 basis points to 8.72%. Christine Lagarde admits that Eurostat\u2019s data (on Greece\u2019s public finances) was more positive than the IMF expected (and other forecasters, she points out), and that might mean the IMF will have to rethink its calculations. However, she suggests that Eurostat might have got the numbers wrong...as they have done before... Dijsselbloem on how the contingency measures to be put forward by Greece might be legislated: In order for the contingency measures to be credible, they need to be legislated. Now how that is designed, whether you just legislate a mechanism, or individual measures is yet to be discussed. Has the Eurogroup given itself too much to do before next Thursday ( when ministers hope to reconvene to discuss progress on Greece), Dijsselbloem is asked. We will all have to bridge our differences. For some of course, the contingency measures are difficult, and for some debt is a big issue, politically difficult. But on all sides it was very constructive today and there was an open attitude to cross that bridge. Dijsselbloem takes a question on the size of the Greek package and contingency measures. He says the upfront package is worth 3% and is almost complete, while the contingency measures will be worth 2% of GDP, to supplement the main package (\u201conly if necessary\u201d). The latest figures from Greece have been quite good so there is reason for some optimism. But to give that extra assurance and confidence, both in the Eurogroup but also outside investors and markets, we are looking for that additional two percentage points. Christine Lagarde is speaking. The head of the International Monetary Fund says progress on Greece is being made. She says measures must be \u201clegislated up front, and credible\u201d. We are confident we can work together well and I have asked my team to be ready to return to Athens right away to continue the work. It has to work on two legs: the measures on the one leg, and debt sustainability on the other. Back at the Eurogroup in Amsterdam, finance ministers support the idea that Greece needs to come up with contingency measures as an insurance policy against \u201cdownside risks\u201d. So that if there is any financial shock and Greece needs to do more, it will be able to do so rapidly. My colleague Jill Treanor is tweeting from the HSBC annual meeting here. Dijsselbloem says that Greece will go away and work both on a possible upfront package of measures, and a package of contingent measures. The Eurogroup will then meet again on Thursday next week (he stresses this is not 100% confirmed yet), to discuss the proposed measures. We will also have a \u201cserious conversation\u201d about a debt relief package for Greece. He confirms there is \u201cno support [among eurozone finance ministers] for nominal haircuts on the debt\u201d. Here we go, Dijsselbloem is taking his place. He jokes about how many press conferences there will be today and tomorrow...three. The eurozone has weathered global events quite well. Having said that, let\u2019s turn to Greece. Co-operation between the institutions and Greek authorities has been strong and productive. We believe substantial progress has been made and we are close to agreement. Today we looked at the way to go forward... The policy package should include a contingent package that should be implemented if necessary to meet the budget surplus targets. The design of that needs further work, what the measures would be and what would trigger it. Journalists await Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is due to give a press conference any minute now. HSBC bosses are in for some stick at today\u2019s AGM... Journalists are reporting long queues to get through security: HSBC is the latest major corporate to face shareholder contempt at its annual meeting on Friday. As the Guardian\u2019s Jill Treanor reports, the Panama Papers, executive pay, and boardroom composition are all expected to be high on the agenda. Oil prices are on course to finish up for the third week in a row. Brent crude oil is currently trading at $44.39 a barrel (down 0.3% on the day). Crude is up more than two-thirds since its early 2016 lows, and traders said sentiment was improving despite a persistent oversupply. Goldman Sachs said in a note: While this recent rally has the potential to run further to the upside ... we believe that is not yet driven by a sustainable shift in fundamentals. Mining giant Anglo American has responded to the shareholder revolt staged at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting. More than 40% of investors voted against the \u00a33.4m pay of the chief executive, Mark Cutifani, in the latest shareholder protest against boardroom excess. The vote was non-binding. In a statement on Friday, Anglo said it was \u201cmindful\u201d of shareholder concerns about executive pay. The mining company said it would consult with shareholders over the coming months before its next annual meeting in 2017, when a revised pay policy will be put to the vote. The company said: Setting executive remuneration in a volatile industry such as mining can be challenging and the remuneration committee intends to again engage with shareholders in order to refine the policy to ensure that it is both appropriate and motivational. Anglo shares are down this morning - along with other miners - falling 2% to 732p. Dijsselbloem is expected to give a press conference following the Eurogroup meeting at 11.15 UK time (12.15 in Amsterdam). We will be reporting his comments, and you should be able to watch the presser live here. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been spotted chatting to Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, at the Eurogroup meeting in Amsterdam. The two men have been involved in a verbal bust up over the amount of stimulus the ECB is pumping into the eurozone economy, as it attempts to kick-start a meaningful recovery and stave off deflation. Sch\u00e4uble thinks it has gone too far, with record low rates causing problems for German banks and pensioners. Here they are today putting their differences to one side... maybe. Dijsselbloem is presumably on hand in case tensions rise... Judging by your reader comments below the line, you are not convinced there will be much progress made on Greece in Amsterdam today... Back to Amsterdam... You can hear what Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem had to say as he arrived for the meeting here. Among other things, he spoke up for Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who yesterday fiercely defended the independence of the central bank in the face of German criticism over its stimulus programme. Draghi\u2019s main point was: We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent. This is what Dijsselbloem said: Mr Draghi has to do his work [independently]. That also means we politicians really restrain ourselves. He has to take decisions that are good for the eurozone as a whole within his mandate, and that is exactly what the ECB is doing. The more we refrain from comments, the more effective he can be. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit and author of the flash Germany PMI report, described growth in the private sector in Europe\u2019s largest economy as \u201cunspectacular\u201d and \u201cuninspiring\u201d. Markit\u2019s surveys for the German manufacturing and services sectors suggest growth in the private sector was the slowest in nine months in April. It was dragged down by the services sector, with the headline PMI falling unexpectedly to 54.6 in April from 55.1 in March. Manufacturing was better, rising to 51.9 from 50.7. Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple, has told the BBC the US tech giant should pay more tax. He said all firms, including Apple, should pay the same 50% tax rate he does. Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne in 1976, told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Wake Up to Money: I don\u2019t like the idea that Apple might be unfair \u2013 not paying taxes the way I do as a person. I do a lot of work, I do a lot of travel and I pay over 50% of anything I make in taxes and I believe that\u2019s part of life and you should do it. European investors are lacking cheer this morning, with all major indices in the red: Combined, the manufacturing and services PMIs suggest the French private sector just about scraped growth in April. The composite PMI rose to 50.5 from 50 in March, hitting a five-month high. Jack Kennedy, who compiles the French surveys at Markit, said: The French private sector economy eked out marginal growth at the start of the second quarter after broadly stagnating on average during the opening three months of the year. Expansion was centred on the dominant service sector, as manufacturing was weighed down by a sharp drop in incoming new orders. The PMI data continue to paint a picture of a private sector economy stuck in a weak growth trajectory accompanied by little meaningful job creation. The PMI data for the French manufacturing and services sector is a bit of a mixed bag this morning. French manufacturing activity fell in April at an accelerated rate. The headline PMI index (measuring output, new business, confidence and employment), dropped to an 8-month low of 48.3, from 49.6 in March. Anything below 50 indicates contraction. It was worse than expected, with economists polled by Reuters predicting the headline manufacturing index would pick up slightly to 49.8. The services sector fared better in April, with activity rising to a five-month high. The headline services PMI rose to 50.8 - back in expansion territory - from 49.9 in March. Despite his cheer, Dijsselbloem is already managing expectations about what the Eurogroup will actually achieve today. Greece is trying to hammer out an agreement with its international lenders to unlock further loans, but Dijsselbloem said it was still early days in the process. Speaking in Amsterdam, he said: I\u2019m hearing good news from Athens, so let\u2019s see where we are. If we make progress on the content of the programme and the next steps then we need to start the discussion on debt. We\u2019re only at the beginning of that discussion, so don\u2019t expect any deals today. Debt is a discussion we\u2019ve not had before. The only thing we had was a promise that if the Greeks would commit fully and deliver on the programme we would look at, if necessary, further debt measures. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup and Ecofin president (and Dutch finance minister), is welcoming his colleagues to the wonderful city of Amsterdam. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The main event today is the the Eurogroup meeting in Amsterdam, where finance ministers will discuss the latest developments in the Greek debt crisis and try and hammer out a way forward. The meeting will take place 9am-12pm (local time, 8am-11am UK time) at the Maritime Museum in Amsterdam. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup (and Ecofin) president will give a press conference when the meeting concludes. It will be followed by an Ecofin meeting - where ministers from the nine EU countries that are not part of the eurozone will join their colleagues. On the agenda there is a working lunch on EU budget problems; a session on the Panama Papers; and a session on strengthening the banking union. We will bring you all the latest developments from Amsterdam throughout the day. Elsewhere we have the flash manufacturing and services PMIs for Germany and France for April, which will offer the latest indication of how Europe\u2019s two largest economies are doing.",

As part of <strong><a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/business/gertjan-vlieghe-the-bank-of-england-ratesetter-who-didn-t-even-want-to-be-an-economist-a3231651.html\">a profile of the Bank\u2019s newest rate-setter</a></strong>, the subject of interest rates comes up:</p> <blockquote> <p>But could the Bank of England follow the example of others by cutting interest rates into negative territory if necessary? Vlieghe\u2019s answer is intriguing: \u201cTheoretically, I think interest rates could go a little bit negative.\u201d He says that the Bank would \u201chave to think very carefully\u201d about whether the positive effects would outweigh the downside \u2014 as in Switzerland, for example, where mortgage rates went up. </p> <p>He adds, however: \u201cEven if you are willing theoretically to consider negative interest rates, there is only so far that they can go negative before you start worrying about the thing that central bankers have been worrying about all these years \u2014 which is \u2018not only am I not getting any interest paid on my money in the bank, it is now potentially going to charge me, in which case I won\u2019t keep my money in the bank, I\u2019ll just take it out and keep it at home\u2019. Once that happens, that is almost certainly negative for the economy because then you undermine the whole bank funding model... so we want to stay well away from that scenario.\u201d</p> <p>How deep into negative territory could rates go? That depends on the costs to large companies of storing, transporting and insuring huge piles of cash themselves, he argues. \u201cPeople have tried to come up with how much it costs to do that. I\u2019ve seen estimates in the range of anything from 0.75% and up. Once you start thinking about rates 0.75% negative, companies are going to start taking that seriously. I think the switching point is somewhere around minus 0.5%, minus 0.75%, maybe minus 1%.

      "bodyText": "De Beers, the world\u2019s largest diamond company, is to leave its UK headquarters after almost a century, as parent company Anglo American trims costs. About 300 staff were told on Friday that they would be leaving 17 Charterhouse Street, from where De Beers once controlled the flow of diamonds around the world. The move ends an era that began in 1889 when Cecil Rhodes, the company\u2019s first chairman, began sending diamonds back from South Africa to a London syndicate of 10 merchants. Charterhouse Street became the centre of De Beers\u2019 empire \u2013 and therefore the global diamond trade \u2013 in the early 1930s. Anglo American will now seek a buyer for the building as part of a plan to offload $4bn (\u00a32.8bn) in assets to reduce its debt. The mining company and its peers are wrestling with rock-bottom commodity prices that have forced the industry to take drastic steps to mend strained balance sheets. Staff will move from the high-security building, near London\u2019s jewellery hub of Hatton Garden, to Anglo\u2019s headquarters at Carlton House Terrace on the fringes of St James\u2019s Park. Prospective buyers for 17 Charterhouse Street will be bidding for an address that boasts both history and a helipad. The Charterhouse Street building once housed De Beers\u2019 entire diamond operation, apart from its mines of course. But in recent years Anglo has moved its diamond-sorting operation and auction process nearer to the source of the stones, in Botswana\u2019s capital, Gaborone. De Beers\u2019 slick marketing operation and other corporate functions remained at Charterhouse Street, but the loss of diamond sorting signalled the beginning of the end for the Charterhouse Street headquarters. It still boasts a helipad used by the Oppenheimer family, even though they sold their 40% stake in the company to Anglo for $5.1bn (\u00a33.5bn) in 2011. De Beers controlled as much as 90% of the diamond market in the 1980s, processing stones through its Diamond Trading Company (DTC). The firm only allows authorised dealers known as \u201csightholders\u201d to buy from the DTC, which once gave it such a tight grip on global supply that it was able to control prices. The company has since seen its market share decline to about 33% with the rise of Russian producer Alrosa, new discoveries not controlled by De Beers and moves by domestic miners in Australia to break away from the status quo.",

      "bodyText": "The University of Warwick has joined calls for BP to honour a promise made by its chairman to open up a company archive containing valuable research on renewable energy. The pressure comes a week after the oil company faced a shareholder revolt over executive pay and days before it expected to report a first-quarter loss of $140m (\u00a397m), compared with a $2.6bn profit in the same period of 2015. Administrators at Warwick confirmed they were pressing BP to increase access to the archive which is believed to contain decades of valuable knowledge and insight into \u201cgreen\u201d power technologies. \u201cDecisions on access to that archive are made by BP but the university has undertaken to talk with BP about how they make those decisions and whether access can be widened,\u201d said a spokesman for Warwick. The BP archive is housed in the modern records centre on the university\u2019s campus and BP chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, last year was challenged about why information of potential interest to scientists was kept locked away. He denied this was the case, telling shareholders at last year\u2019s annual general meeting: \u201cNothing is locked away. We share everything happily.\u201d But attempts by students from the Fossil Free Warwick campaign group to gain access to the information was rebuffed. The students then asked for meetings with university administrators to call on their help with BP. BP declined to comment, but Clare Hymer from the Fossil Free Warwick said the fact that university management was in dialogue with the oil firm was a victory. \u201cWe see this as an important step in getting our university to sever all ties with BP and breaking the stranglehold of the fossil fuel industry over public institutions more widely,\u201d she said. Oil companies such as BP and Shell are already under pressure from climate change campaigners to cut their ties with museums and art galleries. BP recently ended sponsorship deals with Tate and the Edinburgh international festival but claims this is because of financial cutbacks. City analysts believe BP will unveil the $140m loss on the back of another big fall in oil prices which averaged $34 a barrel in the first three months of this year compared with $44 in the same quarter of 2015. BP made a profit of $196m in the last quarter of 2015.",

    "webTitle": "Volkswagen takes \u20ac16bn hit for diesel scandal as it makes \u20ac4bn loss", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has slumped to its first annual loss in more than 20 years after setting aside \u20ac16.2bn (\u00a312.6bn) to cover the cost of its diesel emissions scandal. The German carmaker plunged to a loss of \u20ac4.1bn for 2015, worse than analysts had expected and the company\u2019s first annual loss since 1993. It follows a \u20ac12.7bn profit in 2014. The firm also revealed sizeable pay cuts for senior staff to reflect the impact of the scandal on its results, which it was due to report in early March but was forced to delay in light of the diesel affair. The company more than doubled its provision for fixing diesel cars to \u20ac16.2bn, a day after announcing plans for the biggest car buyback in history in the US, affecting potentially almost 500,000 vehicles, as part of a deal with the State Department to halt more than 600 class action civil suits. VW said the provision related to the emissions scandal was, \u201camong other things, for pending technical modifications and customer-related measures as well as global legal risks\u201d. The carmaker stunned the world when it admitted last September it had installed software in diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests \u2013 potentially affecting 11m cars worldwide. Volkswagen also spent \u20ac400m during the year on restructuring its commercial vehicles and passenger car divisions. The chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, said: \u201cThe current crisis \u2013 as the figures presented today also reveal \u2013 is having a huge impact on Volkswagen\u2019s financial position. Yet we have the firm intention and the means to handle the difficult situation we are in using our own resources.\u201d Despite M\u00fcller\u2019s confident prediction, the company fleshed out the details of voluntary pay cuts for the executive team. Volkswagen said its supervisory board had accepted a proposal from the board of management to reduce their contractual pay, meaning an \u201cordinary member\u201d of the board will see their pay fall 39% from \u20ac5.3m in 2014 to \u20ac3.2m for 2015. It said the typical amount executives will actually take home will be closer to \u20ac2.2m, thanks to a plan to defer 30% of performance-related pay. This element will be converted into shares that won\u2019t be handed over in full unless their price rises by 25% after three years. \u201cIn an intensive decision-making process over the past few weeks, justified public expectations and contractual conditions have been weighed up against each other,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis arrangement expresses the commitment of the board of management to the company, its employees and its customers,\u201d said M\u00fcller, who took over in September last year when his predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, resigned in the wake of the emissions scandal. While pay cuts will affect Volkswagen\u2019s board of management, which includes M\u00fcller, the firm said members of its supervisory board would not be affected. German firms typically operate with a two-tier governance structure in which the supervisory board is responsible for oversight of executive decisions made by the board of management. But the supervisory board chairman, Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, said he would also accept a pay reduction that will see him forfeit \u20ac2.3m \u201cat his own request\u201d. Excluding the provision and other special items, the 12-brand group, whose marques include Audi, Bentley and Porsche, posted a \u20ac12.8bn operating profit. Pointing to this figure, M\u00fcller said the group\u2019s operations \u201care in great shape\u201d. \u201cWere it not for the sizeable provisions we made for all repercussions of the emissions issue that are now quantifiable, we would be reporting on yet another successful year overall.\u201d Shareholders were handed a dividend worth \u20ac0.11 per ordinary share, or \u20ac0.17 for holders of a different class of security known as preferred shares.",

The firm also revealed sizeable pay cuts for senior staff to reflect the impact of the scandal on its results, which it was due to report in early March but was forced to delay in light of the diesel affair.</p> <p>The company more than doubled its provision for fixing diesel cars to \u20ac16.2bn, a day after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/21/volkswagen-buying-cars-back-vw-settlement-emissions-scandal\">announcing plans for the biggest car buyback in history in the US</a>, affecting potentially almost 500,000 vehicles, as part of a deal with the State Department to halt more than 600 class action civil suits.</p> <p>VW said the provision related to the emissions scandal was, \u201camong other things, for pending technical modifications and customer-related measures as well as global legal risks\u201d.<br></p> <p>The carmaker stunned the world when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-timeline-events\">admitted last September it had installed software</a> in diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests \u2013 potentially affecting 11m cars worldwide. </p> <p>Volkswagen also spent \u20ac400m during the year on restructuring its commercial vehicles and passenger car divisions. </p> <p>The chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, said: \u201cThe current crisis \u2013 as the figures presented today also reveal \u2013 is having a huge impact on Volkswagen\u2019s financial position. Yet we have the firm intention and the means to handle the difficult situation we are in using our own resources.\u201d</p> <p>Despite M\u00fcller\u2019s confident prediction, the company fleshed out the details of voluntary pay cuts for the executive team. Volkswagen said its supervisory board had accepted a proposal from the board of management to reduce their contractual pay, meaning an \u201cordinary member\u201d of the board will see their pay fall 39% from \u20ac5.3m in 2014 to \u20ac3.2m for 2015.</p> <p>It said the typical amount executives will actually take home will be closer to \u20ac2.2m, thanks to a plan to defer 30% of performance-related pay. This element will be converted into shares that won\u2019t be handed over in full unless their price rises by 25% after three years.</p> <p>\u201cIn an intensive decision-making process over the past few weeks, justified public expectations and contractual conditions have been weighed up against each other,\u201d the company said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis arrangement expresses the commitment of the board of management to the company, its employees and its customers,\u201d said M\u00fcller, who took over in September last year when his predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, resigned in the wake of the emissions scandal.<br></p> <p>While pay cuts will affect Volkswagen\u2019s board of management, which includes M\u00fcller, the firm said members of its supervisory board would not be affected.</p> <p>German firms typically operate with a two-tier governance structure in which the supervisory board is responsible for oversight of executive decisions made by the board of management.</p> <p>But the supervisory board chairman, Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, said he would also accept a pay reduction that will see him forfeit \u20ac2.3m \u201cat his own request\u201d.<br></p> <p>Excluding the provision and other special items, the 12-brand group, whose marques include Audi, Bentley and Porsche, posted a \u20ac12.8bn operating profit.<br></p> <p>Pointing to this figure, M\u00fcller said the group\u2019s operations \u201care in great shape\u201d. \u201cWere it not for the sizeable provisions we made for all repercussions of the emissions issue that are now quantifiable, we would be reporting on yet another successful year overall.\u201d</p> <p>Shareholders were handed a dividend worth \u20ac0.11 per ordinary share, or \u20ac0.17 for holders of a different class of security known as preferred shares.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A top Bank of England policymaker has floated the possibility of interest rates being cut below zero, meaning companies would pay to deposit their money with banks. Jan Vlieghe, a member of the BoE\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee, did not rule out the idea of following other central banks in taking interest rates negative but said the Bank would \u201chave to think very carefully\u201d about whether the positive effects would outweigh the downsides. Asked about cutting rates into negative territory, Vlieghe told the Evening Standard newspaper: \u201cTheoretically, I think interest rates could go a little bit negative.\u201d But emphasising how cautious the Bank would have to be, he added: \u201cEven if you are willing theoretically to consider negative interest rates, there is only so far that they can go negative before you start worrying about the thing that central bankers have been worrying about all these years \u2013 which is \u2018not only am I not getting any interest paid on my money in the bank, it is now potentially going to charge me, in which case I won\u2019t keep my money in the bank, I\u2019ll just take it out and keep it at home\u2019. \u201cOnce that happens, that is almost certainly negative for the economy because then you undermine the whole bank funding model ... so we want to stay well away from that scenario.\u201d Vlieghe\u2019s willingness to contemplate negative interest rates \u2013 where those depositing money effectively pay for the privilege \u2013 contrasts somewhat with Bank governor Mark Carney\u2019s stance. Questioned by MPs earlier this week, Carney said: \u201cWe think we could move base rate closer to zero but have not said we have an appetite for negative interest rates.\u201d Interest rates are already at a record low of 0.5%, having been slashed during the financial crisis. Carney has hinted at rate rises in the past but none have been forthcoming and financial markets do not see rates moving from 0.5% this year. But with economic growth showing signs of slowing amid a global trade downturn and jitters among businesses ahead of the EU referendum, there has been some speculation that borrowing costs could be cut further. In bids to spur spending and fend off deflation, a number of central banks have taken key interest rates negative, including in the eurozone, Japan, Switzerland and Sweden. But debate has raged among policymakers and economists over the relative costs and benefits of taking interest rates negative and charging depositors. In Germany, the European Central Bank\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy has infuriated savers. Finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said low interest rates were causing \u201cextraordinary problems\u201d for German banks and pensioners and risked fuelling the rise of anti-EU sentiment. Asked how deep into negative territory interest rates could go, Vlieghe told the Evening Standard it would depend on the costs to large companies of storing, transporting and insuring cash piles. \u201cOnce you start thinking about rates 0.75% negative, companies are going to start taking that seriously. I think the switching point is somewhere around minus 0.5%, minus 0.75%, maybe minus 1%. But I\u2019m also saying I don\u2019t even want to get close to it because I don\u2019t know exactly where it is,\u201d said Vlieghe, who joined the MPC last year. Central banks\u2019 loose monetary policy attracted the ire of one of the City\u2019s most outspoken economics commentators, Albert Edwards, on Friday. In a research note he said central banks\u2019 money printing programmes, known as quantitative easing, had made \u201cvirtually no difference to the economic recoveries other than to inflate asset prices, make the rich richer, inequality worse and make Joe and Joanna Sixpack want to scream in rage.\u201d \u201cI have not one scintilla of doubt that these central bankers will destroy the enfeebled world economy with their clumsy interventions and that political chaos will be the ugly result,\u201d said Edwards, strategist at the bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.",

      "bodyText": "HSBC needs to do more to protect the financial system from \u201cbad actors\u201d, the bank\u2019s chairman admitted to shareholders on Friday. Addressing investors during often heated exchanges at the bank\u2019s annual general meeting, Douglas Flint referred to the 2,300 companies that Britain\u2019s biggest bank and its affiliates had created through the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca. Only 5% of the companies were still in existence, he said, and insisted it was no longer possible to open such accounts without transparency. The unprecedented leak of 11.5m files from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca has prompted anger worldwide at the way wealthy individuals can hide their money offshore. Flint said the revelations predated the tougher rules about financial crime, regulatory compliance and tax transparency standards implemented in recent years. \u201cWe are taking steps to align our customer base with these higher standards, relinquishing clients unable or unwilling to furnish full transparency of their affairs,\u201d said Flint. \u201cWe are committed to working with the relevant public authorities to fight financial crime and keep criminals out of the financial system.\u201d However, he admitted there was more to do. \u201cWe are, however, not yet where we need to be \u2026 HSBC\u2019s determination to address emerging risks and enhance our ability to identify bad actors remains resolute,\u201d said Flint, who has said he will leave HSBC next year after 20 years on the board. He provided little information about when his successor might be chosen. The non-executive director rumoured to be being lined up for the role - Henri de Castries, the outgoing boss of French insurer Axa - refused to comment on whether he was a candidate. At the meeting Flint had an ill-tempered exchange with one private investor who regularly attends the AGM, Michael Mason-Mahon, who waved handcuffs as a \u201cUS bonus\u201d \u2013 a move Flint said was \u201ccompletely out of order\u201d. Mason-Mahon said he would vote against the chairman\u2019s re-election to the board, although 96% of shareholders voted in favour. HSBC\u2019s admission in its annual report that an official monitor had raised \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about the slow pace of change to its procedures to combat crime sparked questions from shareholders about whether the bank would lose its US banking licence. The monitor was imposed by US regulators after the bank was fined \u00a31.2bn in 2012 for failing to implement money-laundering controls, allowing Mexican drug traffickers to deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars a day in HSBC accounts. Flint insisted the bank was doing everything it could to appease American regulators and likened the monitor\u2019s report to his own school reports \u2013 \u201ca report card that says we know you\u2019re committed \u2026 but there\u2019s more to do\u201d. Unlike last year, when one in four investors failed to support the remuneration report, this year the bank averted a row over pay by announcing changes to cut pay by 7%. This year 90% voted to support the pay report \u2013 covering last year\u2019s rewards \u2013 and 96% for the pay policy, which covers pay deals for the next three years. The pay of chief executive Stuart Gulliver was reduced to \u00a37.3m in 2015, a year in which profits remained flat at \u00a313.2bn. The share price was 611p at the time of last year\u2019s AGM but is only about 468p now. The bank reiterated its warning that it would move jobs to France if the UK voted to leave the EU. Flint said there would be a \u201cperiod of great economic uncertainty in the event of a vote to leave and should the UK economy slow and economic conditions deteriorate as our research suggests, in at least the short to medium term, this would affect many of our customers in the UK and the economic environment we operate in\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s top carmakers will recall 630,000 vehicles to fix diesel engine software technology that has been blamed for causing high pollution, while the emissions scandal engulfing Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Motors deepened. Porsche, Volkswagen, Audi, Opel and Mercedes diesel cars will be recalled as part of a clampdown on nitrogen oxide emissions, according to a German government official. BMW, which invested in fuel-saving technologies earlier than most rivals, is not part of the recall, the official said. Audi and Porsche are owned by the Volkswagen group, which admitted last September that it had installed software in 11m diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests. On Thursday, VW agreed to buy back or fix about 482,000 vehicles fitted with the software in the US. Shares in Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz, fell nearly 7% on Friday after it announced that it had begun an investigation into its emissions testing at the request of the US Department of Justice. Peugeot shares dropped as much as 4.5% after French anti-fraud investigators raided the carmaker\u2019s offices in Paris as part of a widening investigation linked to the VW emissions scandal. The French carmaker said its vehicles complied with emissions standards in all countries where it operates. In Japan, Mitsubishi shares crashed to a new low after US authorities said they had requested information from the Japanese automotive group. Mitsubishi admitted this week that it manipulated test data to overstate the fuel efficiency of 625,000 cars and there are fears that more models may be involved. Government officials raided one of its offices on Thursday. The scandal has wiped about 40% off Mitsubishi\u2019s market value, amounting to losses of $3.2bn over three days. The shares fell nearly 14% on Friday, following declines of 20% on Thursday, when they were suspended, and 15% on Wednesday. An official at the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told Reuters that the regulator had asked Mitsubishi for information on vehicles sold in the US. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: \u201cAs anticipated, the wrongdoing looks like it goes well beyond VW. Like PPI mis-selling by banks, this scandal could result in spiralling costs for the industry as more class actions follow. \u201cWhether the cheating at any other firms is quite on the scale of VW is another matter, but the damage to the industry\u2019s reputation will not be easily fixed.\u201d Japanese government officials said Mitsubishi could be responsible for reimbursing consumers and the government if investigations conclude that the vehicles were not as fuel-efficient as claimed. The transport minister, Keiichi Ishii, told a news conference on Friday: \u201cThis is a serious problem that could lead to the loss of trust in our country\u2019s auto industry.\u201d He said he wanted Mitsubishi to examine the possibility of buying back affected cars. The internal affairs minister, Sanae Takaichi, said the government would also ask the carmaker to pay for any subsidies granted to consumers if its cars are found to fail fuel economy standards, Jiji news agency reported. Japanese media reported that Mitsubishi had submitted misleading mileage data on its i-MiEV electric car, which is also sold overseas. The previously disclosed models whose fuel economy readings Mitsubishi has admitted to manipulating are only sold in Japan \u2013 four of its mini-cars, two of which it manufactured for Nissan. The Sankei newspaper said Mitsubishi is also suspected of using non-Japanese test methodology on its RVR, Outlander, Pajero and Minicab MiEV models. Mitsubishi had already admitted there could be more models that violate Japanese regulations, and a spokesman said on Friday that the company was still examining those models. Japan\u2019s transport ministry has ordered the company to submit a full report on its test data within a week, while other Japanese carmakers have to submit fuel economy test data by 18 May.",

Sales at the fast food chain\u2019s established US locations rose 5.4% in the first quarter, the company announced on Friday. This is the third quarter in a row that the company has reported an increase in sales. McDonald\u2019s attributed the increase to the popularity of its all-day breakfast, introduced last October, and the McPick 2. Rolled out for a limited time this quarter, McPick 2 allowed customers to select two items from its McPick menu for $5. The menu included the Big Mac, 10-piece Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish and Quarter Pounder with Cheese. The $5 menu was introduced just two months after McDonald\u2019s tried out a McPick 2 for $2. Comparable sales for the company\u2019s international segment increased 5.2% for the quarter, led by strong performance in the UK, Australia and Canada. \u201cSome of the challenges we\u2019ve had in the US have been somewhat self-inflicted. We moved away from the Dollar Menu and didn\u2019t replace it with significant enough value in the eyes of consumers,\u201d Steve Easterbrook, McDonald\u2019s president and chief executive officer, said last July.

For the quarter, we generated higher sales, revenues and operating income in constant currencies across all business segments.\u201d Global sales rose 6.2%, which the company attributed to having an extra 24 hours to sell its burgers thanks to leap day. In the first quarter, McDonald\u2019s net income was $1.1bn. Its earnings per share, at $1.23, came in 7 cents above analysts\u2019 expectations, and its revenue, at $5.9bn, also exceeded Wall Street projections. \u201cWhile there is still work to be done, we are on the right path to make even greater progress,\u201d said Easterbrook. The next step of McDonald\u2019s turnaround plan includes a bigger and a smaller Big Mac.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lord Price, the former boss of supermarket chain Waitrose, has received a golden goodbye worth \u00a31.9m from the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership. The payment is on top of the estimated \u00a31.3m he was paid as the grocer\u2019s managing director and deputy chairman in 2015 and is likely to raise eyebrows among staff, given a recent cost-cutting drive that has seen some canteens close and delivery drivers asked to work longer hours. According to John Lewis\u2019s annual report, Price, who was installed as Britain\u2019s new trade minister this month, is being paid \u00a3988,523 in lieu of salary, car, pension and other benefits for the remainder of his notice period and compensation for loss of office totalling \u00a3237,132. In addition, he will receive \u00a3642,541 as payment in lieu of an entitlement to six months\u2019 leave. The six-month sabbatical is a company perk for staff members with more than 25 years\u2019 service. However, due to his top executive role Price was unable to take the sabbatical. He had worked at the retailer for 33 years. In 2015 the annual bonus for John Lewis and Waitrose staff fell for the third year in a row as profits at the group, which also owns the eponymous department store, declined owing to higher pension charges. Underlying pre-tax profit for 2015 fell 10.9% to \u00a3305.5m on revenues that were 2.2% higher at \u00a39.7bn. As a result the bonus pool was reduced from \u00a3156.2m to \u00a3145m, which worked out at an average payment of \u00a31,585 for each of its 91,500 partners. Workers at the partnership, from the chairman to supermarket shelf stackers, receive the same percentage payout, which in 2015 was 10% of salary. Price, nicknamed the \u201cChubby Grocer\u201d, announced his intention to step down last autumn. He was shortlisted for the role of chairman of Channel 4, but was overlooked in favour of Charles Gurassa, the deputy chairman of easyJet. He remains the broadcaster\u2019s deputy chairman. The retailer\u2019s chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, was the highest paid director in the year to 30 January 2016, earning \u00a31.5m, which was in line with the previous year. A spokesman for the John Lewis Partnership said of the near \u00a31m payment that the timing of Price\u2019s departure had been agreed in the \u201cbest interests of the partnership\u201d. \u201cThat agreement had private contractual implications, hence the payment announced today,\u201d he said. While Waitrose does not hold investor meetings, the disclosure of Price\u2019s pay comes a time when shareholders appear to be more willing to vote against pay deals. BP and Smith &amp; Nephew have already suffered investor votes against pay and attention will next week turn to the pharmaceutical company Shire, which is in danger of an investor backlash at its annual meeting over a 25% salary rise for its chief executive.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/20/waitrose-boss-mark-price-quits\">Lord Price</a>, the former boss of supermarket chain Waitrose, has received a golden goodbye worth \u00a31.9m from the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership.</p> <p>The payment is on top of the estimated \u00a31.3m he was paid as the grocer\u2019s managing director and deputy chairman in 2015 and is likely to raise eyebrows among staff, given a recent cost-cutting drive that has seen some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/09/john-lewis-to-shut-canteens-and-introduce-longer-shifts-for-drivers\">canteens close and delivery drivers asked to work longer hours</a>.</p> <p>According to John Lewis\u2019s annual report, Price, who was installed as Britain\u2019s new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/mark-price-waitrose-foreign-office-trade-minister\">trade minister</a> this month, is being paid \u00a3988,523 in lieu of salary, car, pension and other benefits for the remainder of his notice period and compensation for loss of office totalling \u00a3237,132.</p> <p>In addition, he will receive \u00a3642,541 as payment in lieu of an entitlement to six months\u2019 leave. The six-month sabbatical is a company perk for staff members with more than 25 years\u2019 service. However, due to his top executive role Price was unable to take the sabbatical. He had worked at the retailer for 33 years.</p> <p>In 2015 the annual bonus for John Lewis and Waitrose staff fell <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonus-to-lowest-level-for-12-years\">for the third year in a row</a> as profits at the group, which also owns the eponymous department store, declined owing to higher pension charges. Underlying pre-tax profit for 2015 fell 10.9% to \u00a3305.5m on revenues that were 2.2% higher at \u00a39.7bn. </p> <p>As a result the bonus pool was reduced from \u00a3156.2m to \u00a3145m, which worked out at an average payment of \u00a31,585 for each of its 91,500 partners. Workers at the partnership, from the chairman to supermarket shelf stackers, receive the same percentage payout, which in 2015 was 10% of salary.</p> <p>Price, nicknamed the \u201cChubby Grocer\u201d, announced his intention to step down last autumn. He was shortlisted for the role of chairman of Channel 4, but was overlooked in favour of Charles Gurassa, the deputy chairman of easyJet. He remains the broadcaster\u2019s deputy chairman.</p> <p>The retailer\u2019s chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, was the highest paid director in the year to 30 January 2016, earning \u00a31.5m, which was in line with the previous year.</p> <p>A spokesman for the John Lewis Partnership said of the near \u00a31m payment that the timing of Price\u2019s departure had been agreed in the \u201cbest interests of the partnership\u201d. \u201cThat agreement had private contractual implications, hence the payment announced today,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While Waitrose does not hold investor meetings, the disclosure of Price\u2019s pay comes a time when shareholders appear to be more willing to vote against pay deals. BP and Smith &amp; Nephew have already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal\">suffered investor votes against pay</a> and attention will next week turn to the pharmaceutical company Shire, which is in danger of an investor backlash at its annual meeting over a 25% salary rise for its chief executive.</p> <p>Stefan Stern, the director of the High Pay Centre, said he was surprised by the size of Price\u2019s payment. \u201cJohn Lewis seem to be falling into line with extraordinary plc contracts where a CEO\u2019s whole life is golden, from hellos to parachutes and goodbyes.

But now analysts at the company\u2019s house broker Liberum have given some support to the shares, which have jumped nearly 5% to \u00a323.76. Liberum\u2019s Tom Gadsby issued a buy note and raised his target price from \u00a331 to \u00a337. He said: The stock is down 22% year to date as wider concerns over China and US Wholesale have, wrongly in our view, impacted Ted. We address investors\u2019 concerns and find the company in good shape. In a challenging environment we believe that Ted will outperform its peers given the strength of the brand and the channels to market. Despite a tough market in teh second half of 2015 for luxury goods and retail Ted performed well with Retail sales growth of 8% and total sales growth of 12%. Ted is developing a well-balanced business with multiple routes to market. Retail, Wholesale and Licencing are complemented by an increasingly important online business which brings the brand to a wider audience without necessarily needing to roll out new stores. Online reached 15% of group Retail sales last year, and 19% of UK and Europe Retail sales. Licensing revenues grew by 23% to \u00a314.4m, 24% of Group EBIT. Ted\u2019s sales densities slowed in the second half of 2015 impacted by a tough trading environment, unseasonal weather patterns and the terror attacks in Paris which saw fewer shoppers on the High Street and a reduction in tourist traffic. Our analysis of Ted\u2019s sales patterns over the past year shows two things: that there has been a continued channel shift with trade moving online, which we believe is margin accretive; and that there is a misconception in the market that sales densities are a direct proxy for like for like sales. In our view the timing of store openings can be a negative drag on sales density metrics while like for like sales growth at peers is flattered in relative terms by excluding immature space. While the retail sector saw a slowdown in growth in the second half of 2015 the tide has turned more sharply for the luxury goods sector as seen in profit warnings from Burberry and Hugo Boss. As an international brand we find that, in the minds of some investors, Ted\u2019s fortunes may be similarly under pressure. We believe that this is the wrong interpretation. Ted\u2019s exposure to China is minimal at around 2% of sales. Its US wholesale business is strong and performing substantially better than peers. The company\u2019s pricing architecture, with product prices comfortably below Ralph Lauren and Hugo Boss, as well as pricing integrity with low promotional participation, supports demand for full price sales.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Welsh billionaire Sir Terry Matthews has said he could be willing to put his own money behind a management buyout of Tata Steel\u2019s UK business and the Port Talbot steelworks. Matthews said he is \u201cfeeling really good\u201d about the prospects of a rescue deal for the steel business, which could save thousands of jobs in the UK. Matthews, who made his fortune in technology and telecoms, is part of a consortium of public and private sector figures from south Wales supporting a management buyout. The tycoon said the consortium is still putting its team together and its funding has yet to be finalised, but that he is ready to back the buyout. \u201cIf it makes sensible business and the future looks really good, frankly there will be investors and we already know it,\u201d he told BBC Wales. \u201cPotentially me too. The fact is, you first put a really good team together, then you fight in an area which has upside. So I am feeling pretty good about it.\u201d Tata Steel has contacted 190 potential buyers about rescuing its UK business, but the backing of Matthews has helped the management buyout to emerge as a credible option. The consortium held talks all-day on Thursday at Celtic Manor, Matthews\u2019 golf course and resort in south Wales, and welcomed the news that the government is prepared to take a 25% in the business alongside a private sector buyer. Matthews adds: \u201cI believe the steel industry for one reason or another has reached a low point \u2013 price per tonne of steel is an example. That\u2019s the time to invest, not when things are going really well. If it is at a low point, it is probably going to go up. \u201cSo I am looking forward to a future \u2013 in particular for the steelworks in Port Talbot, I know the people there very well \u2013 that is more next generation steel. \u201cRight now it is power hungry. Let\u2019s see if we can make steel in the future which is the next generation \u2013 lower power, better quality, global market. The steel industry is never going to go away. For the United Kingdom it\u2019s a strategically important industry.\u201d The consortium also includes Simon Gibson, the chief executive of Matthews\u2019 investment vehicle Wesley Clover, and Steve Phillips, the chief executive of the Neath Port Talbot county borough council. A key figure in the group is Roger Maggs, a former executive at metals company Alcan Aluminium, now part or Rio Tinto. Maggs is the chairman of the Port Talbot waterfront enterprise zone and co-founded investment firm Celtic House with Matthews. He is understood to have committed himself full-time to working on the rescue bid, which revolves around activating a turnaround plan for the steel business drawn up by management but rejected by the Tata board in Mumbai last month. \u201cI have seen it, not in total detail, and I think it is viable,\u201d Maggs also told BBC Wales. \u201cI think they will turn it around by the end of 2017, early 2018. I have seen these things before. This is not pie in the sky. This is hardworking, attention to detail, efficiencies that can be achieved.\u201d Maggs claimed the Tata Steel business is losing less than \u00a31m a day \u2013 as has been claimed \u2013 and that the Indian company may have rejected the turnaround plan because it wanted to close the Port Talbot steelworks to reduce market capacity. \u201cI suspect it wasn\u2019t just about the viability of the plan. Steel is a global material, and the price of it is influenced by global supply and demand. It\u2019s Adam Smith. Guess what \u2013 there is too much steel and not enough demand, so that is why the price goes down. By the way, it is not the Chinese\u2019s fault. They make the cheapest steel so of course they are going to be the last to close capacity to get the price back up. \u201cI think [Tata] wanted less capacity in the world. I think they wanted to close it. Now they are currently talking about selling it, but I think for them that was probably second prize. I think they wanted less steel in the world.\u201d",

This is hardworking, attention to detail, efficiencies that can be achieved.\u201d</p> <p>Maggs claimed the Tata Steel business is losing less than \u00a31m a day <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/30/tata-steels-british-plants-must-be-sold-within-weeks\">\u2013 as has been claimed \u2013</a> and that the Indian company may have rejected the turnaround plan because it wanted to close the Port Talbot steelworks to reduce market capacity.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect it wasn\u2019t just about the viability of the plan. Steel is a global material, and the price of it is influenced by global supply and demand. It\u2019s Adam Smith. Guess what \u2013 there is too much steel and not enough demand, so that is why the price goes down. By the way, it is not the Chinese\u2019s fault. They make the cheapest steel so of course they are going to be the last to close capacity to get the price back up. </p> <p>\u201cI think [Tata] wanted less capacity in the world. I think they wanted to close it. Now they are currently talking about selling it, but I think for them that was probably second prize. I think they wanted less steel in the world.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The owner of Alton Towers is facing a multimillion-pound fine after it admitted breaking health and safety laws over the rollercoaster crash that seriously injured five passengers. Two people had their legs amputated after the collision on the Smiler ride in June last year, while three others suffered life-changing injuries. The five most seriously injured victims appeared in court in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, on Friday morning as the theme park\u2019s owner, Merlin Entertainments, pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety rules. District judge John McGarva said the firm faces a \u201cvery large fine\u201d when it next appears at Stafford crown court on 20 May, with the figure possibly reaching seven figures. The guilty plea is believed to make Alton Towers the first major UK theme park whose owners have admitted a criminal breach of health and safety laws. Joe Pugh, 19, and his girlfriend Leah Washington, 18, who both suffered serious leg injuries in the crash on 2 June last year, stood shoulder-to-shoulder outside North Staffordshire justice centre as a lawyer read a statement on behalf of the victims. Paul Paxton, of Stewarts Law, said the guilty plea was \u201ca milestone along the way to psychological rehabilitation\u201d. He added: \u201cGiven that such serious injuries could be sustained on a fun day out, it is hardly surprising that a criminal offence was committed. However, it is comforting for the families that a plea of guilty has been entered rather than the victims having to endure a drawn-out trial. \u201cToday is not seen as a victory; the families are not motivated by retribution, but inevitably this guilty plea will be a milestone along the way to psychological rehabilitation. Regrettably the physical recovery will be a lifelong process.\u201d A total of 16 people were injured when their carriage collided with an empty carriage on a low section of the ride, which can reach speeds of up to 50mph. The five seriously injured were Washington, 18, and Pugh, 19, from Barnsley; Vicky Balch, 21, and Daniel Thorpe, 28, from Buxton in Derbyshire; and Chandaben Chauhan, 49, from Wednesbury, West Midlands. Passengers were trapped more than seven metres (20ft) from the ground at an angle of about 45 degrees before eventually being freed by emergency workers. The Smiler reopened in March, nine months after the crash, prompting Balch to accuse the theme park owner of putting money before safety. After an internal investigation, Merlin Entertainments said in November that the crash was a result of human error because an operator decided to override a safety system. In court, the company was alleged to have breached section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, which states: \u201cIt shall be the duty of every employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health or safety.\u201d Asked by the court usher to enter a plea to the charge, Simon Antrobus, the barrister appearing for the firm, said: \u201cI\u2019m duly authorised by Merlin Attractions Limited to enter a guilty plea to the charge.\u201d Pictures released by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) after the court hearing showed the damage caused by the high-impact collision. In one photograph, the front bumper of the carriage that carried the passengers can be seen almost completely caved in towards the front row of seats. Bernard Thoroughgood, counsel for the HSE, which brought the prosecution, told the court that the flagship rollercoaster \u201cwas not as safe as it should have been\u201d. He said the ride was \u201cmechanically sound\u201d but there was no proper procedure in place for staff in the event of an error. Thoroughgood said the victims had submitted impact statements to the court in with they said their pain was \u201cindescribable\u201d and many said \u201cmy life and my family\u2019s life has been turned upside down\u201d. Outside court, Neil Craig, head of operations for HSE in the Midlands, said: \u201cThose injured on 2 June last year had every right to expect a carefree and fun day out. The incident was profoundly distressing for everyone involved, both physically and mentally. It left some with life-changing injuries. We hope this first milestone will help those affected to continue their recovery from this tragic incident.\u201d Merlin \u2013 which also owns Legoland, Madame Tussauds and the London Eye \u2013 said it overcame a fall in revenues at its theme parks to post an annual pre-tax profit rise of 0.3% to \u00a3250m in the year to 26 December. It said Alton Towers had a significant fall in visitor numbers after the accident, which resulted in the 200-hectare (500-acre) theme park in Staffordshire being shut down for four days.",

On Melrose, analyst David Larkam of Numis moved his recommendation from buy to hold, pointing out that its shares have climbed by 40% since it returned some \u00a32.4bn to shareholders earlier this year after selling meter business Elster for \u00a33.3bn. Melrose specialises in buying up businesses, improving them, then selling them on, but Numis said it now preferred to wait for more news on any future deal. Larkam said: Melrose shares are up 40% since the return of Elster capital in January and trade at a 20% premium to our sum of the parts valuation. This reflects investor appetite to participate in the next deal given that there have been no changes to the underlying business or expectations. Whilst the track record supports such enthusiasm we see little reason to get involved at current premium levels and .. prefer to wait until there is clarity on the next transaction. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley has cut its target price on Mitchells from 430p to 340p, saying: Tough industry trading leads us to cut earnings per share forecasts 6-10% and our price target to 340p. However, we remain overweight as the relatively new chief executive is focused on improving performance, and if this fails we see plenty of other options to unlock value in this asset-rich business. Ahead of the group\u2019s results on 19 May, the bank\u2019s analyst Jamie Rollo continued: The chief executive\u2019s three themes [at the company\u2019s November update] were (1) building a more balanced business, (2) instilling a more commercial culture, and (3) increasing the pace of execution and innovation. There are some indications of the latter. For example, the last few months have seen a new look, O\u2019Neill\u2019s, Miller &amp; Carter\u2019s \u201cSteak Table\u201d experience, a Toby Carvery app, the roll-out of contactless payments and Apple Pay, a new craft keg festival, a trial of its own coffee blend, and plans to add 500 digital gaming machines. However, these examples are hard to quantify, and we would look for clarity on: (1) group targets (e.g. like for like sales, operating margins, return on invested capital), (2) how the company aims to drive like for like sales (e.g. premiumisation, digital/Customer Relationship Management capabilities, improved food offer, more new product development/innovation, better incentivisation), and (3) plans to mitigate costs, particularly on the introduction of the National Living Wage but perhaps also a review of overheads (noting it has already restructured its senior operations teams). Melrose is down 13.8p or 3.5% at 378.1p while Mitchells has fallen 9.6p to 273.3p.",

But supermarkets are bucking the trend, with Sainsbury up 5.6p to 294.4p as Deutsche Bank moved from hold to buy and lifted its target price from 265p to 325p, citing the benefits of the purchase of Argos owner Home Retail. But the bank cut its rating on Morrisons from hold to sell to little effect, with the shares up 2.5p to 193.7p. On Sainsbury Deutsche said: We factor in the expected accretion from the Home Retail Group acquisition and increase our price target 23% from 265p to 325p. In our view, investors are reluctant to factor in this earnings accretion due to execution risk. We also show that Sainsbury\u2019s has achieved the greatest reduction in the level of promotions of the Big 4, over the past 18 months. We think this can contribute to a better margin trend. On 13 times consensus 2016 PE, Sainsbury\u2019s share price already reflects downside risk to near term earnings. In combination with a 3.5% dividend yield, we see 15% return potential. With risk/reward skewed to the upside, we upgrade from hold to buy. Tesco is 4.65p better at 189.65p after Fitch revised its outlook for the supermarket from negative to stable, on the expectation of a recover in the UK market. Overall the FTSE 100 is 44.03 points at 6337.41, with Rio Tinto down 64.5p at \u00a323.40 and Antofagasta falling 10.6p to 475.5p. Anglo American has dropped 13p to 734.3p as it confirmed 41.5% of investors voted against its remuneration report. Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: The Dow Jones non ferrous metals index took a pummelling yesterday, finishing around 7% lower and this is certainly weighing on sentiment amongst the miners this morning. Burberry has dropped 19p to \u00a312.54 as the luxury sector came under pressure after disappointing results at the Gucci brand of France\u2019s Kering. Housebuilders have regained some ground after recent weakness with Persimmon up 41p at \u00a319.23, Barratt Developments was 10.5p better at 520.5p and Berkeley Group rose 54p to \u00a329.46. Analysts at Liberum said: We turned cautious on housebuilders in November citing stretched valuation and our fears of margin pressure. The shares have underperformed with Brexit and prime London the main culprits. Margin pressure remains a threat and not all Brexit risks are priced in, but valuation is much more accommodating. We remain more cautious than most but see little downside in the sector now. We upgrade Barratt and Persimmon to hold, leaving only Taylor Wimpey at sell.

The bank and its its affiliates created more than 2,300 companies through Mossack Fonseca, the Panamanian law firm from which a leak of of 11.5m files prompted anger about the way wealthy individuals can hide their money offshore. HSBC may face questions about the Panama Papers at the bank\u2019s annual general meeting in London, where shareholders will vote on the election of directors to the board as well as on executive pay. The chairman, Douglas Flint, has already told investors that a search for his successor is under way \u2013 signalling the fact that the new chair will then lead the search for a chief executive to replace Stuart Gulliver. Gulliver\u2019s pay was reduced to \u00a37.3m in 2015, a year in which profits remained flat at \u00a313.2bn ($18.8bn) and the bank conceded that an official monitor, who was installed at the bank after a money-laundering scandal four years ago, had raised \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about the slow pace of change to its procedures to combat crime. The monitor was imposed by the US regulators after the bank was fined \u00a31.2bn in 2012 for failing to implement money-laundering controls, allowing Mexican drug traffickers to deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars each day in HSBC accounts. When the Panama Papers were published earlier this month, HSBC said the documents pre-dated a thorough reform of its business model. \u201cThe allegations are historical, in some cases dating back 20 years, pre-dating our significant, well-publicised reforms implemented over the last few years,\u201d the bank said. At last year\u2019s AGM nearly one in four shareholders voted against its pay deals, and the deputy chairman, Sir Simon Robertson, said that neither Flint nor Gulliver would be replaced. At the time, the bank was mired in revelations about the activities of its Swiss banking arm, from which leaked account details showed it had helped customers evade tax. The AGM is taking place at a time of renewed shareholder activism. Two FTSE 100 companies, BP and Smith &amp; Nephew, have already lost votes on pay reports, while more than 40% of shareholders at the mining company Anglo American voted against the pay of its chief executive.

      "bodyText": "Gas suppliers on the east coast of Australia have used a market restructure to hike prices on domestic consumers and there is evidence pipeline operators have set monopoly prices, the competition watchdog has said. The lack of competition in gas supply even warrants consideration of whether joint marketing by one of the largest suppliers, the Gippsland Basin joint venture between Esso Australia and BHP Billiton Petroleum, has substantially lessened competition. These are conclusions of the the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry into the competitiveness of the east coast gas market released on Friday. The inquiry was sparked by complaints from Australian industry that from 2012 they could not get offers for gas supply for 2016 and beyond or received few offers at high prices. At the time gas was increasingly being liquified for export to international markets, decreasing supply for domestic industry. The ACCC has backed up these complaints, finding Australian industry received \u201cfew, if any, real offers for gas\u201d, including offers being \u201cat sharply higher prices and on strict take it or leave it terms\u201d. \u201cThere are now more gas supply offers available in the market but they are from fewer sources of supply, higher priced, often for shorter durations and with tighter non-price terms and conditions. Other problems also remain in the market.\u201d The ACCC found that the Gippsland Basin joint venture \u201cholds significant market power\u201d and its joint marketing \u201cmay have a more detrimental impact on competition than in the past\u201d. The competition watchdog will now investigate whether the joint marketing substantially lessens competition, in breach of the Competition and Consumer Act. The ACCC said more sources of gas are needed, particularly in the southern states, as they are becoming \u201coverly dependent\u201d on the joint venture. A spokeswoman for BHP Billiton Petroleum said: \u201cThe company believes supply by the [joint venture] to the east coast gas market is competitive and is effectively meeting the requirement of gas buyers currently and will continue to do so into the future. \u201cThe company will continue to work with the ACCC on this matter, as it has done throughout the course of the inquiry.\u201d The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said the report showed the gas market is opaque, there are significant risks to supply and that the competitive dynamics south of Queensland are deteriorating considerably. \u201cGas plays a critical role as a feedstock and an efficient source of heat and power to industry,\u201d he said. \u201cGas users have been raising the alarm for several years about the impact of massive change in the market on industry and the consequences for investment and jobs.\u201d Willox said: \u201cMaximising effective competition in the market is crucial, whether it involves bringing on new suppliers or changing the dynamics between existing suppliers.\u201d The ACCC rejected calls to reserve a proportion of Australia\u2019s gas for domestic use, as has been suggested by the Australian Workers Union. It said such a policy would reduce domestic prices in the short term but weaken incentives to explore and extract more gas \u201cto the detriment of the level and diversity of supply for domestic gas users\u201d. Instead the ACCC recommended requiring industry to provide better information about price and availability of gas supply to increase transparency for consumers. A spokesman for the AWU said the argument about extraction investment was a \u201cfurphy\u201d and highly theoretical, when experience showed showed Australia could use its gas reserves to provide local consumers with cheap, relatively green energy. \u201cGreater price transparency would be a plus, but even better would be a national interest test, akin to the US or Canada, or, better still, a gas reservation policy.\u201d The ACCC also found evidence that a large number of existing gas pipeline operators had been engaging in monopoly pricing. Evidence included special charges and revenues in excess of what would be expected if pipelines were regulated sufficiently. It noted monopoly pricing was not a breach of the law and said it was a \u201clegitimate and expected commercial behaviour\u201d. \u201cMonopoly pricing can, nevertheless, have a detrimental effect on economic efficiency and consumers.\u201d Pipelines with substantial market power should be subject to greater regulation, and be forced to publish financial information so customers can determine whether the prices are justified by the pipeline\u2019s costs, it recommended. The ACCC will also consider whether the availability or pricing of capacity on regional pipelines constitutes misuse of market power. The assistant treasurer, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, said the ACCC had established the facts in the gas market after the confidential nature of contracts, prices and negotiations had hampered the ability of previous reviews to disentangle and test the assertions about the market. The energy and resources minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the report showed \u201cthat unless the commonwealth and state governments work together to address supply-side constraints, consumers and industry will bear the cost of higher gas prices and less reliable supply\u201d. The Council of Australian Governments energy council will discuss the report in a video conference.",
