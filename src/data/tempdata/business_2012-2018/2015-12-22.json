      "bodyText": "Opposition politicians and tax campaigners have expressed outrage after it emerged that some of the biggest and most profitable investment banks in the City of London paid little or no corporation tax last year. Seven City banks paid a combined \u00a321m in corporation tax in 2014, according to research by Reuters on Tuesday. Between them the banks, together employing about 33,000 mainly City workers, generated UK profits of \u00a33.6bn on revenues of \u00a321bn in the UK. Five of the banks \u2013 JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Nomura and Morgan Stanley \u2013 disclosed their main UK arms paid no corporation tax, according to Reuters. Goldman Sachs UK Ltd revealed UK tax of $26.6m on UK profits of $1.98bn. UBS also recorded low UK tax. Tax disclosures were released in country-by-country filings required of investment banking companies. They detail staff numbers, turnover, profits and tax paid by key trading subsidiaries in each country where they are active. The figures lay bare how firms shift income from high- to low- tax jurisdictions. Labour MP, John Mann, said: \u201cThe tax receipts from these large financial institutions show what a charade their claim to pay their fair share has become. They rely on the taxpayer to underwrite their risk, yet they pay a minimal return back to the exchequer.\u201d Barry Johnston, ActionAid campaign director, said: \u201cThe disclosure that UK banks are paying tiny amounts of tax will fuel public anger at a tax system perceived as being hugely unfair. These shocking revelations lay bare the huge flaws in the global tax system which allow multinationals to slash their tax bills by shifting numbers around on a spreadsheet.\u201d Low tax bills for banks are in large part a legacy of huge losses reported in the years since the banking crash of 2008. Those losses created an unprecedented stockpile of tax credits, which banks have been using to offset against taxable income as they have moved back into profit. Last year, chancellor George Osborne admitted the situation meant \u201csome banks wouldn\u2019t be paying tax for 15 or 20 years\u201d \u2013 which he described as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. From the current 2015-16 tax year, he said bank tax losses would only be available to offset against half of taxable profits. Analysis by Reuters found at least some of the banks paid no tax because they reported losses in London, while reporting profits in much smaller affiliates in lower tax jurisdictions. The bank filings are available because of a 2013 change to European Union rules that requires banks to publish country-by-country profit and tax breakdowns.",

At that price, according to Tuesday\u2019s formal takeover prospectus, the combination would boost cash flow as soon as 2016. \u201cThis underlines the benefits of the transaction to shareholders,\u201d intones the bidder, \u201cparticularly in the current oil market downturn, as it structurally reduces the oil price breakeven of Shell.\u201d In other words: please, dear investors, don\u2019t get any fancy ideas into your heads about voting down chief executive Ben van Beurden\u2019s landmark \u00a336bn transaction just because the oil price has fallen and the takeover price now looks over-cooked. In the end, one suspects shareholders will do as they are commanded. Appetites for rebelling against titans of the FTSE 100 index are always modest. Even chief sceptic David Cumming of Standard Life didn\u2019t actually say he would vote against the deal. And many institutional shareholders own both stocks and thus can afford to take the view that what they lose on Shell\u2019s swings they will gain on BG\u2019s roundabouts. Up to a point, Shell\u2019s ever-reducing recalibration of its breakeven point is persuasive. Lower oil prices always cause operating costs to fall because contractors are expected to shoulder some of the pain. Jobs can be cut, and exploration budgets can be squeezed, and the savings become bigger when pursued over a bigger operation. But scepticism is still the right stance towards this deal. The real question is whether Shell would have agreed these terms \u2013 383p in cash, plus shares currently worth 665p \u2013 if it could have guessed oil would fall from $65 a barrel during talks last April to $36 today. The answer is plainly no. BG\u2019s shares hit 800p in January before Shell turned up and, at a conservative estimate, might trade at 700p today if the company was staring at an independent future. So Shell, in effect, is paying a 50% takeover premium with more than a third of the bid in cash. Oil is a long-term business and assets aren\u2019t available on demand. But, by any conventional yardstick, Shell is overpaying massively for BG. Borrowing target looks like a long shot There are still a few months left in the financial year, so it\u2019s too soon to say the chancellor will miss his borrowing target. But you can understand why City economists don\u2019t fancy his chances. The ambition is to limit borrowing for the year as a whole to \u00a368.9bn, but after eight months the tally is \u00a366.9bn. Put another way, the chancellor is aiming to borrow \u00a320bn less than last year, but has managed only \u00a36.6bn less after two-thirds of the race has been completed. At the current rate of progress, there would be a \u00a310bn gap. Embarrassment if the target is missed would belong primarily to the Office for Budget Responsibility, which updated its projections only last month. The OBR, naturally, offered reasons why it may still be proved correct. Special factors were at work last month \u2013 there were no big fines to be collected from banks and the timing of a payment to the World Bank was rescheduled. More importantly, the new year is supposed to bring new cheer for the chancellor in the form of a surge in income tax from self-assessment payers and a pick-up in stamp duty on properties. What if that whoosh of receipts doesn\u2019t materialise as advertised? In that case, the OBR\u2019s credibility would suffer a heavy blow. It rowed against the City consensus when it projected that borrowing would fall by \u00a320bn this year. If it is out by even \u00a35bn, that is serious. More to the point, a miss would create a serious headache for George Osborne in his March budget. By late February \u2013 when the January borrowing data is released \u2013 the OBR will know whether its confidence is well-founded. If it is not, the chancellor\u2019s ambition to achieve a budget surplus in this parliament will once again look fanciful. Fastjet: a good idea, but slow to take off A low-cost pan-African airline, modelled on easyJet and Ryanair? Terrific idea. The distances in Africa can be huge, the roads poor and the market is growing. What could go wrong? A lot. Backers of Aim-listed Fastjet \u2013 who include easyJet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and big-name fund manager M&amp;G \u2013 could be forgiven a weary groan as the company warned that revenues for this year and 2016 will be lower than anticipated. Fastjet has been buffeted by falling currencies and is now caught in the cross-breeze of disputed elections in Tanzania, home to its operational base; local bureaucrats, you see, aren\u2019t flying so often. The deeper problem is that Fastjet is still concentrated in Tanzania. Africa \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 is not the EU and permits have not been granted as speedily as Fastjet had hoped. A Zambian operation is due to happen next year, belatedly. The net result is that Fastjet, despite raising \u00a350m from investors in April, is now worth just \u00a330m. Investors\u2019 disappointment is understandable, but that valuation may be overdoing the gloom. The idea behind the business still sounds excellent, even if arrival is delayed by half a decade or so.",

    "webTitle": "Latest borrowing figures threaten Osborne's deficit target", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fears were heightened on Tuesday that George Osborne will miss his deficit reduction targets after the latest official figures showed that the government\u2019s budget deficit was 10% higher last month than in November 2014. The City said the chancellor now faced an uphill struggle to cut the deficit to \u00a368.9bn in the 2015-16 financial year after figures for the first eight months showed borrowing already at \u00a366.9bn. Despite news that the deficit for November was bigger than expected, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body that produces forecasts for the Treasury, said it was still possible that the chancellor would be able to stick to his plan. The OBR said a number of one-off factors, including \u00a31.1bn of fines paid by banks last November and the timing of payments from the Department for International Development to the World Bank, had made the figures look worse than they were. \u201cOver the first eight months of the financial year, borrowing was only \u00a36.6bn lower than last year,\u201d the OBR said. \u201cIf borrowing was to fall at the same average year-on-year rate in the next four months, public sector net borrowing (PSNB) would only fall by around \u00a310bn in 2015-16 as a whole. Considerable uncertainty remains over prospects for borrowing in the rest of the financial year, but we continue to expect PSNB to fall more sharply over the final four months of the year than over the first eight.\u201d But City economists were taken aback by news that the deficit in November stood at \u00a314.1bn, up from \u00a312.8bn a year earlier, and questioned whether the chancellor would be able to deliver a budget surplus by the end of the parliament without further tax increases or spending cuts. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \u201cThe public finances still are not improving as quickly as the chancellor anticipates, raising the prospect that he will have to announce additional austerity measures to achieve his goal of budget surplus by the end of this parliament.\u201d Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said the chancellor faced a \u201cmassive task\u201d to meet his fiscal target, even though the public finances could be volatile from month to month and allowing for the OBR\u2019s conviction that there would be a hefty jump in self-assessment tax receipts in January. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Osborne had failed to deliver on his promises made five years ago when he became chancellor. \u201cGeorge Osborne promised in 2010 that this would be the year the books would be balanced and austerity would come to an end, but instead the year is ending with borrowing and debt both going up,\u201d he said. A Treasury spokesman blamed the rise in borrowing last month on a number of \u201cone-off factors\u201d. He added: \u201cBeyond these factors, we can see that our plan is working, with government receipts growing \u2013 stronger income tax, VAT and on-shore corporation tax \u2013 showing the benefits of a growing economy with record employment levels.\u201d Analysts said it would require a big improvement in the remaining four months of the year to hit the OBR forecast. In the same months of 2014-15, the government borrowed \u00a316bn. \u201cThere was no festive cheer for the chancellor in November\u2019s UK public finances figures,\u201d said Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics. \u201cIndeed, it now looks almost impossible for Mr Osborne to meet the OBR\u2019s forecast for the fiscal year as a whole.\u201d Hollingsworth added that if the trend for the first eight months of the year continued, borrowing would total around \u00a381bn for 2015-16. \u201cThe upshot is that, barring a Christmas miracle, the chancellor looks extremely unlikely to meet his borrowing forecasts this year.\u201d",

Considerable uncertainty remains over prospects for borrowing in the rest of the financial year, but we continue to expect PSNB to fall more sharply over the final four months of the year than over the first eight.\u201d</p> <p>But City economists were taken aback by news that the deficit in November stood at \u00a314.1bn, up from \u00a312.8bn a year earlier, and questioned whether the chancellor would be able to deliver a budget surplus by the end of the parliament without further tax increases or spending cuts.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \u201cThe public finances still are not improving as quickly as the chancellor anticipates, raising the prospect that he will have to announce additional austerity measures to achieve his goal of budget surplus by the end of this parliament.\u201d</p> <p>Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said the chancellor faced a \u201cmassive task\u201d to meet his fiscal target, even though the public finances could be volatile from month to month and allowing for the OBR\u2019s conviction that there would be a hefty jump in self-assessment tax receipts in January. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Osborne had failed to deliver on his promises made five years ago when he became chancellor. <br></p> <p>\u201cGeorge Osborne promised in 2010 that this would be the year the books would be balanced and austerity would come to an end, but instead the year is ending with borrowing and debt both going up,\u201d he said. </p> <p>A Treasury spokesman blamed the rise in borrowing last month on a number of \u201cone-off factors\u201d. <br></p> <p>He added: \u201cBeyond these factors, we can see that our plan is working, with government receipts growing \u2013 stronger income tax, VAT and on-shore corporation tax \u2013 showing the benefits of a growing economy with record employment levels.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts said it would require a big improvement in the remaining four months of the year to hit the OBR forecast. In the same months of 2014-15, the government borrowed \u00a316bn.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no festive cheer for the chancellor in November\u2019s UK public finances figures,\u201d said Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics. \u201cIndeed, it now looks almost impossible for Mr Osborne to meet the OBR\u2019s forecast for the fiscal year as a whole.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hollingsworth added that if the trend for the first eight months of the year continued, borrowing would total around \u00a381bn for 2015-16. \u201cThe upshot is that, barring a Christmas miracle, the chancellor looks extremely unlikely to meet his borrowing forecasts this year.\u201d</p>",

At the first tasting of this new line of puddings in the kitchens of manufacturer Matthew Walker, chef David Sanderson notes the Californian almonds, walnuts and pecans, Chilean flame raisins and Vostizza currants. Consumers will have to wait two years before this particular pudding goes on sale. But it is no exaggeration to say that the vast majority of households up and down the country will be tucking into other creations by the Derby-based firm on Friday, because it supplies 95% of the UK Christmas pudding market. That means turning out 26m puds a year for all the major supermarkets and brands \u2013 from German discounters such as Lidl and Aldi through to Harrods and Waitrose. This particular tasting, under top secret conditions, is of the UK\u2019s first 24-month \u201cmatured\u201d Christmas pudding \u2013 developed for Lidl. The supermarket already sells an 18-month matured pudding, as does Sainsbury\u2019s, but this new one will further push culinary boundaries. \u201cIt\u2019s only three months into maturation but eventually it will have a truly unique flavour \u2013 unlike anything else on the market,\u201d said Sanderson. During peak manufacturing time from May to November, the company, part of the giant 2 Sisters Food Group, mixes and steams 700,000 puddings a week in a slick, semi-automated operation. Supplying hospitals, prisons and caterers as well as most popular high street retailers, the scale of Matthew Walker\u2019s production and the volume of ingredients used is mind-boggling. Last Christmas it took delivery of 1.3m litres of brandy, cider and sherry \u2013 enough to more than half-fill an Olympic-sizeswimming pool. It does make other desserts \u2013 sponge puddings and bombes \u2013 but they amount to only 3% of its business. The rest is earmarked to be eaten on one day in the year. But despite the huge energy invested, the commercial reality is that Christmas puddings, although worth \u00a340.6m last year, are not a growth market. Data company IRI this week calculated sales of Christmas puddings and cakes this year were down by 5.3%. But at Matthew Walker, the work goes on. In the experimental kitchen, dozens of new recipes are developed and tested every year in conjunction with the UK\u2019s major retailers \u2013 all in strictest confidence. It has had to respond to changing consumer tastes and competition from lighter desserts and panettone. But talk of the death of the Christmas pudding is premature, said Sanderson. \u201cIf anything, it has got more interesting. Consumers want more variety and we have moved towards more premium products, with everything from jewelled top, glittered, gluten-free, alcohol-free, nut-free and in a range of different sizes.\u201d He jokes that the only ones he has not yet cracked are self-combusting, while \u201cthe only disastrous flavour combination I have ever produced was Drambuie and honey\u201d. Lidl \u2013 which has a solid 5% share of the market \u2013 vouches for the pudding\u2019s continued popularity. Richard Inglis, buying manager for biscuits, crackers and cakes, said: \u201cMost popular by far are the larger puddings feeding eight. However, the smaller Christmas puddings have been a strong area of growth over the last few years, and this year we have introduced a new four-pack of 100g individual Christmas puddings. We expect to increase our Christmas pudding sales by over 30% year on year.\u201d Shoppers are loyal in this sector and Matthew Walker\u2019s research shows that they are most likely to buy a pudding from their usual retailer \u2013 and nine in 10 will buy from a store rather than online. The new generation of matured puddings \u2013 \u201cfed\u201d by alcohol to give them a richer flavour \u2013 are extremely popular and in a recent blind testing by food researchers Campden, 57% of consumers said they preferred matured products. Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference 18-month matured Cognac Laced pudding has been its bestseller this year. A spokeswoman for the supermarket points out that it has won a number of taste tests, including Good Housekeeping\u2019s. Tesco also said single-portion 100g puddings were selling well \u2013 with demand up almost 25% on last year. It expects to sell more of them than family-sized puddings for the first time: 450,000 against 400,000. \u201cWe know many of our customers still love a traditional Christmas pudding, but alternatives have become increasingly popular with younger families,\u201d said the retailer\u2019s Christmas pudding buyer James Taylor. \u201cOver the last few years we\u2019ve seen growing demand for alternatives such as chocolate bombes and panettone sponges and this year we\u2019re offering more choice than ever. We now have three times as many Christmas pudding alternatives than we did 10 years ago.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "US markets have made a bright start to trading following the better than expected third quarter GDP figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 53 points or 0.3%, helping to support European markets which had been tending to drift a little before the US open. The FTSE 100 is now up 42 points or 0.7% while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.45% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.37%. Spain\u2019s Ibex, after Monday\u2019s 3.6% fall in the wake of the inconclusive election, is now up 0.85%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Following the poor UK public finances figures and the reasonable US GDP numbers - which show why the Federal Reserve was happy to raise US rates - the pound has fallen back. Sterling has fallen to an eight month low of $1.4860, down 0.2% on the day. Against a basket of currencies it is down 0.3% to a ten week low. US corporate profits fell by 1.6% in the third quarter, compared to a 3.5% rise in the previous three months. The US economy continues to grow at a healthy pace, although by slightly less than first expected. The latest revision to the third quarter figures showed GDP growth of 2% on an annual basis, down from the 2.1% previously reported. But this was better than the 1.9% analysts had expected. Strong consumer and business spending offset attempts by business to reduce inventories. It was a slowdown from the 3.9% growth reported between April and June, but still marks a reasonable outcome. The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week on the basis the country\u2019s economy was strong enough to accommodate dearer borrowing costs. European shares are drifting after a bright start. The FTSE 100 is currently 0.75% higher despite worse than expected public finance figures, but Germany\u2019s Dax is virtually unchanged while France\u2019s Cac is up just 0.2%. Even though concerns remain about the economic outlook in Spain and the future of its reforms following the weekend\u2019s inconclusive election, the Ibex has recovered some of Monday\u2019s fall and is now up 0.8%. Shortly investors will be presented with the revised third quarter GDP figures from the US. Turkey\u2019s central bank has kept interest rates unchanged, confounding expectations of an increase in borrowing costs. The overnight rate is held at 7.25% despite forecasts of a 25 basis point increase while the repurchase rate is 7.5% compared to expectations of a rise to 8%. The central bank had suggested previously it would raise rates in tandem with the US Federal Reserve, but today\u2019s decision to keep them on hold comes despite the Fed lifting its own rates last week. Investors had called for a rate rise to curb inflation and put a floor under the struggling lira. Despite all the concerns about the Spanish economy following the weekend election and the subsequent uncertainty about the country\u2019s future government, the country\u2019s central bank has raised its growth forecasts for this year and next. The Bank of Spain said it expected the country\u2019s economy to grow by 0.8% in the fourth quarter, the same level as in the previous three months, and it lifted its growth forecast for 2015 from 3.1% to 3.2%. For 2016 it is now predicting growth of 2.8%, up from its previous estimate of 2.7%. But it warned about policy concerns in the wake of the inconclusive election, as well as concerns about a worse than expected slowdown in emerging markets. It said: Internally the main source of uncertainty is associated with the evolution of economic policies, given how much the reform agenda and budget policies in particular affect confidence. Tata Steel is in discussions to sell its struggling UK businesses to investment group Greybull Capital which could safeguard thousands of jobs. The companies have signed a letter of intent and have entered exclusive talks. The deal involves Tata\u2019s Long Products Europe division, including its Scunthorpe steelworks, mills in Teesside and northern France, an engineering workshop in Workington, a design consultancy in York, and associated distribution facilities. It also includes Tata Steel\u2019s Scottish mills in Dalzell and Clydebridge which are currently being mothballed. In a statement Karl Koehler, chief executive of Tata Steel\u2019s European operations, said: \u201cThis is an extremely critical time for the whole industry, and we have been working hard to explore all options that could provide a future for the Long Products Europe business. \u201cWe will now move into detailed negotiations with Greybull Capital. It is too early to give any certainty about the potential outcome of these discussions. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with our trade unions and works councils and will communicate any relevant news to employees on an ongoing basis.\u201d In all, around 4,700 staff work for the Long Products division. Greybull last year rescued struggling airline Monarch. Britain\u2019s steelmakers have been struggling with high costs and increased competition, leading to the collapse of Caparo Industries and the closure of SSI\u2019s Redcar plant. George Osborne\u2019s plan to repair Britain\u2019s public finances has received a fresh setback from official figures showing that the budget deficit in November was 10% higher than in the same month in 2014, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott. The Office for National Statistics said the gap between spending and revenues last month was \u00a314.2bn - an increase of \u00a31.3bn on November 2014. Officials said that one reason for the deterioration was that last November had seen the payment of fines by financial institutions totalling \u00a31.1bn, which had not been repeated in November 2015. Even so, the figures came as an unwelcome shock to the City, which had been forecasting a drop in net borrowing \u2013 the government\u2019s preferred measure of the deficit \u2013 to \u00a311.8bn. Shares fell after the ONS released the data amid fears that the chancellor would now struggle to meet his deficit reduction targets for 2015-16 and to move the public finances into surplus by the end of the parliament. Borrowing during the first eight months of 2015-16 has been \u00a366.9bn, only \u00a32bn short of the total expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility for the whole of the financial year. Analysts said it would require a big improvement in the remaining four months of the year to hit the OBR forecast. In the same months of 2014-15, the government borrowed \u00a316bn. The full report is here: Economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: If the pattern of the first 8 months of fiscal year 2015/16 continued over the rest of the year, PSNBex would come in at \u00a381.2 billion. This compares with the target of \u00a368.9 billion contained in November\u2019s Autumn Statement. The Chancellor now faces a massive task to meet his fiscal targets for 2015/16 and it is frankly hard to see how he can make it \u2013even allowing for the fact that (1) public finances can be volatile from month to month (partly due to the timing of expenditures) and can be revised significantly; and (2) the OBR argues that there should indeed be a substantial improvement in the public finances over the final months of 2015/16 due to a number of factors. This particularly includes an expected jump in self-assessment tax receipts in January resulting from past policy measures. The OBR also expects spending cuts to have an increasing impact as pressure to meet budget targets mounts on departments subject to Treasury controls Gradual progress but much more needed is the verdict of David Kern, chief economist of the British Chambers of Commerce: Although we saw a minor setback in November, gradual progress is being made with reducing the deficit. The public finances are likely to be better this year than in the previous financial year, but the improvement may not be as large as the OBR suggested in the Autumn Statement. The underlying message remains that our budget deficit is still too high, and greater efforts are needed, through reducing current public spending and generating sufficient tax receipts. The UK public finances are not improving as much as hoped, said James Knightly of ING Bank: UK public sector net borrowing (excluding banking groups ) came in at \u00a314.2bn in November versus expectations of \u00a311.8bn. This is actually higher than in November last year (\u00a312.9bn). While we have to acknowledge there does tend to be a lot of volatility in the month to month figures, the cumulative borrowing fiscal year to date suggests that Chancellor Osborne is going to struggle to hit his target. So far, 2015-16 to date borrowing is at \u00a366.9bn, which is only $6.6bn lower than in in the same period of 2014-15. The OBR\u2019s full financial year forecast is \u00a373.5bn [see earlier] but barring a dramatic improvement in the trend, it is looking likely to be missed by possibly more than \u00a35bn. In terms of the breakdown, there have been good improvements in tax revenue with full year to date figures showing a 4.6% increase in income taxes, 4.1% improvement in VAT and a 6.4% increase in corporation tax, which is confirmation of the good growth and employment figures we have seen over the year. Stamp duty collection is disappointing though while fuel, alcohol and vehicle duties have shown little change on the year. Overall, central government receipts are up 3.1% full year to date while government expenditure is up 1.2%. Here, we have seen falling debt interest costs, but net investment is up 8.7%, social benefits are up 1% and department spending is up 1.2%. Things are moving in the right direction, just more slowly than hoped. The new, lower forecast borrowing numbers \u2013 a \u00a327bn improvement was announced in the Autumn Statement over the course of the Parliament - look difficult to achieve at this rate. A surplus of 0.5% of GDP in 2019/20 looks a real struggle. Here\u2019s a comparison of net borrowing with the forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility: The notes in the chart are as follows: For the financial year ending 2015 (April 2014 to March 2015) and the financial year ending 2016 (April 2015 to March 2016). OBR forecast for PSNB ex from November 2015 Economic &amp; Fiscal Outlook OBR forecast for PSNB ex from March 2015 Economic &amp; Fiscal Outlook The OBR target of \u00a368.9bn quoted previously takes into account the recent decision to reclassify housing associations as public entities. Excluding that the OBR borrowing figure is \u00a373.5bn, which the one shown in the above chart. The UK market does not like these borrowing figures. The FTSE 100, which had earlier climbed as high as 6089, is now marginally in negative territory at 6033. Other European markets have also come off their best levels, to be fair. Here\u2019s a chart from the ONS spelling out the debt position: The increase in borrowing excluding banks to \u00a314.2bn in November was partly due to \u00a31.1bn of foreign currency fines paid by financial institutions in the previous year which were not repeated, according to the Office of National Statistics. For the first eight months of the year, public sector net borrowing was 8.9% lower than the same period in 2014 at \u00a366.9bn. But this is already close to chancellor George Osborne\u2019s target of \u00a368.9bn for the full year. He plans to turn the deficit into a surplus by the end of the decade, but has struggled to make much headway in recent months. The full report is here. Breaking news: Bad news for chancellor George Osborne. UK public finances have come in worse than expected, with public sector net borrowing excluding banks rising 10.1% in November to \u00a314.2bn compared to a year ago. Analysts had been expecting a figure of \u00a311.5bn. Fastjet, the African focussed airline where Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou\u2019s easyGroup is a major shareholder, has seen its shares fall nearly 8% after it warned revenues for 2015 and 2016 would be below expectations. It blamed challenging market conditions and currency headwinds for the shortfall. In particular it said the presidential election in Tanzania led to reduced government and civil service traffic, and lower demand for travel generally across the country. A quick summary of commodities this year: After Japan\u2019s Toshiba said it would cut nearly 7,000 jobs after a $1.3bn accounting scandal, Moody\u2019s has cut the company\u2019s credit rating. Moody\u2019s said: Moody\u2019s Japan K.K. has downgraded Toshiba Corporation\u2019s long-term senior unsecured bond ratings to Ba2 from Baa3. Moody\u2019s has also downgraded Toshiba\u2019s subordinated debt rating to B1 from Ba2, and short-term rating to Not Prime from Prime-3... \u201cThe downgrades were prompted by Toshiba\u2019s announcement of its structural reform plan and financial forecast for the fiscal year ending 31 March 2016 (FYE3/2016),\u201d says Masako Kuwahara, a Moody\u2019s Vice President and Senior Analyst. \u201cThe announcement indicated that earnings and cash flow generation will be significantly below our previous expectations.\u201d \u201cWe expect that Toshiba\u2019s leverage will stay high over a prolonged period, given that its restructuring costs will exceed our previous estimates, and our expectation of improvement in earnings, if any, for each business segment will be very gradual even after the restructuring,\u201d adds Kuwahara. The downgrades also reflect Moody\u2019s concerns of a significant deterioration in the Memories business, which would hinder solid profit contributions. Moody\u2019s points out that Toshiba\u2019s Memories business faces intense global competition, rapid changes in technology, and increasing price pressures. Moody\u2019s decision to place Toshiba\u2019s ratings on review for downgrade reflects Moody\u2019s concerns over Toshiba\u2019s funding plan for its announced structural reforms and the pressure on its equity from potential further asset write downs. Next year will see a calmer time in the Greek crisis, according to the Economist\u2019s forecast: Here are the Fitch comments on Spain: The inconclusive outcome of Spain\u2019s general election increases the related risks of prolonged political uncertainty, and potentially a looser fiscal policy stance and/or a reversal of structural reforms... In the short run political uncertainty is likely to have limited impact on fiscal policy as the 2016 budget was approved before the elections. We maintain our baseline assumption that any new government will keep public debt/GDP declining in the latter half of the decade, consistent with eurozone and Spanish fiscal policy rules, although the election increases risks of slippage. But an extended period of political uncertainty and the possibility of a partial reversal of reform and consolidation measures could damage economic confidence and reverse the current benign macro-fiscal dynamics. The full report is here: Fitch: Inconclusive Spain Vote Increases Fiscal, Reform Risks The uncertain outcome of the Spanish election may remain uncertain for a while longer, it seems: And here\u2019s one impact of the election: Oil prices may be edging higher - Brent crude is currently up 0.8% at $36.67 - but recent weakness has been due to fears of a glut, especially when Iran re-starts exports after sanctions are finally lifted. In a report on Iran, the International Monetary Fund has put a figure on the effect of the country re-entering the oil market: The expected increase in oil supply from Iran would put downward pressure on global prices, by an estimated $5\u2013$15 per barrel, boosting global GDP by an estimated 0.3 percentage point. While part of this impact may be already discounted in futures markets, a further decline could materialise when Iran\u2019s exports rise, depending on how other OPEC producers react. The potential for Iran to increase its non-oil trade is also large, with estimates from a gravity model suggesting that Iran\u2019s exports, at about 20 percent of GDP, are less than half of their potential. Commenting on the UK market\u2019s opening rise, analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: After last night\u2019s sharp sell off for London equities, the picture is looking a little more upbeat this morning but with traders heading away from their desks and little fundamental news on the agenda, it\u2019s difficult to try and attribute too much to the early rebound. Only a few stocks are currently in negative territory with ITV bottom of the pile, retracing some of yesterday\u2019s bid-inspired gains, whilst retailers are again feeling the pressure with concerns building over Christmas sales... Natural resources stocks are once again dominating the upper end of the index, but the potential upside is looking relatively limited and it\u2019s difficult to believe this is down to anything more than some opportunistic bargain hunting. In Japan, the government is planning nearly $800bn of spending next year to boost its struggling economy. The move is part of a budget due to be unveiled this week which should also see the country promising to cut back its huge debts. Reuters reports: Finance Minister Taro Aso on Tuesday vowed to boost growth and achieve fiscal reform with government budget spending worth 96.7trn yen ($797.53bn) for the next fiscal year that starts in April. This is up a touch from the 96.3trn yen spending set for the current year\u2019s initial budget. Confirming figures reported by Reuters last week, Aso said tax revenue is estimated at a 25-year high of 57.6trn yen in fiscal 2016. That revenue assumption, based on an expected economic growth of nominal 3.1% and real 1.7%, will allow the government to slash new bond issuance by 2.4trn yen from this year to 34.4trn yen, he said. The budget plans signal a growing commitment by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to rein in the industrial world\u2019s heaviest debt burden even as he continues to pump-prime the economy via a cocktail of expansionary policies. \u201cThis budget is appropriate for marking the first step towards our new fiscal plan while we aim for economic revival and fiscal consolidation at the same time,\u201d Aso told reporters after he presented the budget figures at a meeting between government officials and ruling party lawmakers. In the wake of Spain\u2019s election result at the weekend, which saw gains by anti-austerity party Podemos, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi has warned in an interview with the Financial Times that the policies which many see as being imposed by Germany are having a detrimental effect on governments. The FT reports (\u00a3): Renzi, Italy\u2019s centre-left prime minister, has warned that German-driven eurozone austerity policies are fanning the flames of populism, leading to political paralysis and electoral setbacks across the continent for incumbent governments. In an interview with the Financial Times at his Rome office the day after voters in Spain slashed the majority in parliament enjoyed by centre-right prime minister Mariano Rajoy, leaving him struggling to form a new government, Mr Renzi said there was one main lesson to be learnt. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to my friend Mariano but I know that those who have been in the front line of being the faithful allies of the politics of rigour without growth have lost their jobs,\u201d Mr Renzi said. \u201cIt happened in Warsaw, though the circumstances were very particular there, it happened in Athens, it happened in Lisbon. Let\u2019s see what happens in Madrid,\u201d he added. As forecast, European markets have taken their cue from Wall Street\u2019s overnight gains and a steady performance in Asia following the comments from China about further possible stimulus. The FTSE 100 is up 43 points or 0.7% while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1%, France\u2019s Cac 0.7% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB 0.9%. In Spain the Ibex, which fell 3.6% following the election result, has opened 0.9% higher. European markets are expected to open higher after another volatile day on Monday - not helped by thin trading in the run up to the Christmas break. Shares ended lower in Europe, losing their early gains as the falling oil price again hit sentiment, and the Spanish market dropped 3.6% following the country\u2019s inconclusive election result at the weekend. But with a rise on Wall Street, analysts expect a positive start to the day: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. After hitting 11 year lows on Monday, oil prices have shown some signs of recovery. A glut of supply as Iran restarts exporting following the lifting of sanctions, along with fears of slowing demand, mean the cost of crude is on course for its biggest monthly fall since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in October 2008. But with comments from China suggesting further stimulus measures might be taken to boost the world\u2019s second largest economy, commodity prices have stabilised. So Brent crude after falling as low as $36.05 on Monday, has recovered 0.25% to $36.44. Meanwhile UK public finances will be the centre of attention this morning. The figures are expected to show a rise in UK borrowing for November from \u00a37.5bn to \u00a311.1bn, partly due to the falling oil price which is undermining VAT receipts at the pumps, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. So chancellor George Osborne may well miss his \u00a368.9bn borrowing target for the year. Hewson said: November generally tends to be a weak month in any case with December usually a little stronger as the tax year deadline gets closer. Even allowing for that the Chancellor looks set to fall short of his borrowing target for this tax year unless tax receipts start to improve substantially. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: The public finances are expected to show that the public finances saw year-on-year improvement in November but to also highlight that the Chancellor will need sharply higher tax receipts in January if he is to meet the fiscal target for 2015/16 contained in November\u2019s Autumn Statement. Specifically, we expect Public Sector Net Borrowing excluding banks (PSNBex) to have narrowed to \u00a311.5bn in November from \u00a313bn in November 2014. We also estimate that the total PSNB narrowed to \u00a310.7bn in November 2015 from \u00a312.2bn in November 2014. The Office of Budget Responsibility argues that there should...be a substantial improvement in the public finances over the final months of 2015/16 due to a number of factors. This particularly includes an expected jump in self-assessment tax receipts in January resulting from past policy measures. The OBR also expects spending cuts to have an increasing impact as pressure to meet budget targets mounts on departments subject to Treasury controls. Otherwise, in the wake of last week\u2019s interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve, come the latest third quarter GDP numbers, expected to be revised lower from 2.1% to 1.9%.",

A glut of supply as Iran restarts exporting following the lifting of sanctions, along with fears of slowing demand, mean the cost of crude is on course for its biggest monthly fall since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in October 2008. </p> <p>But with comments from China suggesting further stimulus measures might be taken to boost the world\u2019s second largest economy, commodity prices have stabilised. So Brent crude after falling as low as $36.05 on Monday, has recovered 0.25% to $36.44.</p> <p>Meanwhile UK public finances will be the centre of attention this morning.</p> <p>The figures are expected to show a rise in UK borrowing for November from \u00a37.5bn to \u00a311.1bn, partly due to the falling oil price which is undermining VAT receipts at the pumps, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.</p> <p>So chancellor George Osborne may well miss his \u00a368.9bn<strong> </strong>borrowing target for the year. Hewson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>November generally tends to be a weak month in any case with December usually a little stronger as the tax year deadline gets closer. Even allowing for that the Chancellor looks set to fall short of his borrowing target for this tax year unless tax receipts start to improve substantially.</p> </blockquote> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The public finances are expected to show that the public finances saw year-on-year improvement in November but to also highlight that the Chancellor will need sharply higher tax receipts in January if he is to meet the fiscal target for 2015/16 contained in November\u2019s Autumn Statement<strong>. </strong>Specifically, we expect Public Sector Net Borrowing excluding banks (PSNBex) to have narrowed to \u00a311.5bn in November from \u00a313bn in November 2014. We also estimate that the total PSNB narrowed to \u00a310.7bn in November 2015 from \u00a312.2bn in November 2014.</p> <p>The Office of Budget Responsibility argues that there should...be a substantial improvement in the public finances over the final months of 2015/16 due to a number of factors. This particularly includes an expected jump in self-assessment tax receipts in January resulting from past policy measures. The OBR also expects spending cuts to have an increasing impact as pressure to meet budget targets mounts on departments subject to Treasury controls.</p> </blockquote> <p>Otherwise, in the wake of last week\u2019s interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve, come the latest third quarter GDP numbers, expected to be revised lower from 2.1% to 1.9%. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-12-22T09:30:19.719Z\">at 9.30am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy grew at a slightly slower pace than first thought in the third quarter of 2015, continuing a sluggish recovery trend started after the last recession. The Commerce Department announced Tuesday that gross domestic product (GDP) for the third quarter of 2015 grew at an annual rate of 2%, down from a previous estimate of 2.1%. This was the department\u2019s third and final estimate of the quarter\u2019s GDP. The latest GDP measure, the broadest indicator of a nation\u2019s economic health, marks yet another quarter of low growth and is a marked slowdown from the 3.9% growth rate reported between July and September. Federal Reserve officials are not expecting much improvement in 2016, estimating growth of 2.1% to 2.4%. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, was one of the largest drivers of growth, growing at a 3% annual rate. Spending on plants and equipment, state and local government spending, residential investments, and exports all contributed to the growth. The deceleration in GDP came mainly as companies spent less stockpiling their inventories. Corporate profits after tax fell at a 1.7% rate in the third quarter and profits, undercut by the dollar\u2019s strength and lower oil prices, were down 8.2% from a year ago. The latest GDP figures come after the Fed voted to raise interest rates for the first time in close to a decade. While economic growth has remained sluggish, the US has now added new jobs every month since October 2010 and has added an average of 237,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months. At a news conference announcing the rate hike, Fed chair Janet Yellen said: \u201cThis action marks the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery of the economy from the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.\u201d She said the economy \u201chas come a long way\u201d, though normalization \u201cis likely to proceed gradually\u201d. \u201cThe economy should continue to expand at an above-trend pace through next year. With solid job gains, accelerating wage growth, lower energy prices boosting after-inflation incomes, and low interest rates, consumer spending will continue to lead overall economic growth,\u201d said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC. \u201cThe more extended drag will come from trade, given soft global growth and the strong US dollar that makes exports from the US more expensive and imports to the US less expensive.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel is in talks to sell its European long products business to an investment group in a move that could safeguard 4,700 jobs and keep open several British plants threatened with closure. Tata said it had entered exclusive talks with Greybull Capital to sell a number of plants including its steelworks in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, and mills at Dalzell and Clydebridge in Scotland that are being mothballed. Other sites included in the talks are mills in Teesside and northern France, an engineering workshop in Workington, Cumbria, and a design consultancy in York. Tata has been trying to sell the long products business, which makes railway track and steel used in construction, amid a supply glut and tumbling prices. The company, which owns the remnants of what was formerly British Steel, announced in October that it planned to cut almost 1,200 jobs at Scunthorpe and shut the mills in Dalzell, in Motherwell, and Clydebridge, in Cambuslang, near Glasgow. Tata\u2019s decision underlined the crisis facing the British steel industry after the closure of the Redcar steelworks on Teesside earlier that month. If Tata and Greybull agree a deal, the planned job cuts are likely to go ahead but the remaining 4,700 jobs will probably be preserved. Greybull is understood to believe there is a long-term future for the long products business, which is one of a few makers of specialist goods for established markets. Karl Koehler, chief executive of Tata Steel Europe, said the talks were at an early stage but came at a critical time for the industry: \u201cWe have been working hard to explore all options that could provide a future for the long products Europe business. We will now move into detailed negotiations with Greybull Capital.\u201d Greybull is a family-run fund that invests in struggling companies in the hope of making a profit. Its investments have included the airline Monarch, which has returned to profit after nearly collapsing a year ago, Morrisons convenience stores, and the now defunct Comet electrical goods chain. Greybull said: \u201cGreybull Capital LLP confirms that it has signed a letter of intent with Tata Steel to enter exclusive discussions on the possible acquisition of the long products Europe business based in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire. Whilst this is an important milestone, much work remains to be done to reach a successful outcome.\u201d Tata said it had worked with unions and management to seek a future for the long products division. Unions gave the news a guarded welcome and said they wanted to find out more about Greybull\u2019s plans. Greybull is run by low-profile brothers Marc and Nathaniel Meyohas. Nathaniel worked for the US private equity firm Sun Capital before launching Greybull in 2010 with his brother, who founded and ran Cityspace, a technology company that provided information and technology for people using public transport. Harish Patel, the Unite union\u2019s national officer for metals and foundry, said: \u201cThis is good pre-Christmas news for the various sites, including at Scunthorpe. However, there is a lot of work to be done in formulating the details and the future business plan. We will need to consider whether jobs are safe with this potential sale, the impact on the supply chain, and whether the current terms and conditions for the workforce are affected.\u201d Community, the steel workers\u2019 union, said it was unhappy that no plan was announced to save jobs at the Scottish plate mills, where 70 workers lost their jobs last week and more face redundancy. The Scottish business minister, Fergus Ewing, said: \u201cOur primary aim is to secure a future for Scottish steel. While the development is potentially welcome, the agreement between Tata Steel and Greybull Capital LLP is still at a very early stage and there can be no guarantees it will proceed \u2013 or that it will lead to a secure future for jobs at the plants involved.\u201d",

Its investments have included the airline Monarch, which has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/07/troubled-monarch-airways-returns-profit\">returned to profit</a> after nearly collapsing a year ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/09/former-secret-millionaire-heads-acquisition-of-morrisons-convenience-stores\">Morrisons convenience stores</a>, and the now defunct Comet electrical goods chain. </p> <p>Greybull said: \u201cGreybull Capital LLP confirms that it has signed a letter of intent with Tata Steel to enter exclusive discussions on the possible acquisition of the long products Europe business based in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire. Whilst this is an important milestone, much work remains to be done to reach a successful outcome.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Tata said it had worked with unions and management to seek a future for the long products division. Unions gave the news a guarded welcome and said they wanted to find out more about Greybull\u2019s plans. </p> <p>Greybull is run by low-profile brothers Marc and Nathaniel Meyohas. Nathaniel worked for the US private equity firm Sun Capital before launching Greybull in 2010 with his brother, who founded and ran Cityspace, a technology company that provided information and technology for people using public transport.</p> <p>Harish Patel, the Unite union\u2019s national officer for metals and foundry, said: \u201cThis is good pre-Christmas news for the various sites, including at Scunthorpe. However, there is a lot of work to be done in formulating the details and the future business plan. We will need to consider whether jobs are safe with this potential sale, the impact on the supply chain, and whether the current terms and conditions for the workforce are affected.\u201d</p> <p>Community, the steel workers\u2019 union, said it was unhappy that no plan was announced to save jobs at the Scottish plate mills, where 70 workers lost their jobs last week and more face redundancy.</p> <p>The Scottish business minister, Fergus Ewing, said: \u201cOur primary aim is to secure a future for Scottish steel. While the development is potentially welcome, the agreement between Tata Steel and Greybull Capital LLP is still at a very early stage and there can be no guarantees it will proceed \u2013 or that it will lead to a secure future for jobs at the plants involved.\u201d</p>",

The airline blamed chaos resulting from the general election in Tanzania, its main hub for routes between African countries. The democratic process has taken longer than usual amid allegations of vote-rigging and a refusal by the runner-up candidate to concede defeat. Fastjet said on Tuesday this had led to \u201creduced governmental and civil service traffic and lower demand for travel more widely across the country\u201d. The airline said sales for 2015 and 2016 would be lower than anticipated due to the electoral delay, as well as tough market conditions and weakness in some African currencies. The gloomy forecast, just a few months after it raised \u00a350m to fund expansion plans, sent its shares down by around 7% in early trading. But the business said it was still \u201cwell placed to capture the significant growth potential in the African aviation market\u201d. Fastjet, nearly 11% owned by easyJet tycoon Haji-Ioannou\u2019s easyGroup, was set up with the aim of creating Africa\u2019s first international low-cost airline. Its blueprint was to set up hubs in key African airports to build a network that could offer relatively cheap travel in parts of the continent where road routes are long and in disrepair. But it has taken longer than expected to establish hubs in places such as Zambia and Zimbabwe, as regulatory processes proved slow to operate. Executives have also been distracted by complaints that directors were awarding themselves big pay packages despite the airline making losses. Fastjet said it expects the final stage of its application to run a full-scale hub operation out of Zambia to be complete next year. It has also secured a licence to have a hub in Harare, Zimbabwe, but is not expected to receive international approvals for new routes until the new year. In the meantime the airline said it was \u201ctaking steps to manage its operating costs and overheads\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A string of retailers could face insolvency in the new year with tough trading on the high street in the run-up to Christmas leaving businesses fighting for survival, two influential industry bodies have warned. Widespread discounting and warmer-than-average weather have cranked up the pressure on high street retailers over the festive period. In the last few years a number of high street retailers have called in administrations either just before or after Christmas, including Woolworths, HMV, Zavvi, and Jessops. Retailers generate roughly 40% of their annual profits between October and December, underlining the importance of the period. However, if a high street business struggles during the festive season then its death knell is typically the quarterly rental payment they have to make to landlords at the end of December. Atradius, one of the world\u2019s largest trade credit insurers, has warned that retailers face a \u201cperfect storm\u201d that could lead to a bleak start to 2016 and a \u201cfresh wave of insolvencies\u201d. The comments from Atradius are significant because if a credit insurer refuses to back a retailer then suppliers will be unable to insure their orders with the business and could decide not to provide it with products. Owen Bassett, senior risk underwriter at Atradius, said: \u201cThose who went into the fourth quarter needing \u2013 rather than wanting \u2013 a strong performance could be looking at a troubled future. \u201cExperience tells us that when retailers need an exceptional seasonal sales period and then hit financial difficulty, we often see failures in the first quarter. It is not unusual in this sector to be loss-making during Q1 and with the first payment of quarterly rent due in January it can be difficult to survive after a poor Q4.\u201d Bassett warned that high street chains have been forced to cut the price of their products after Black Friday failed to attract the crowds that flocked to the sales last year. In addition, clothing retailers have had to contend with mild weather, which has dampened demand for winter clothing. Consumer data also suggests that households are choosing to spend their money on leisure activities or home improvement rather than on clothing. Bassett said: \u201cLooking at the sector as a whole, while electrical, furniture and DIY retailers have performed well this year, clothing retailers \u2013 particularly female fashion \u2013 have struggled and that pattern continues. \u201cThe story for high street fashion is not so positive and despite continued demand, the outlook is mixed. \u201cThe female fashion sector is now saturated with many similar businesses competing for the same pound. Those that cannot compete in terms of operational efficiency or that don\u2019t continue to appeal to consumers\u2019 taste in fashion will find themselves in difficulty.\u201d A number of clothing retailers, such as Bonmarch\u00e9, have already warned of challenging conditions on the high street in December. According to Begbies Traynor, the insolvency firm, 24,737 retailers across the country are now suffering \u201csignificant\u201d financial distress, up from 24,251 a year ago. This includes a 11% rise in the number of food retailers under pressure to 4,226 as the supermarket price war and changing shopping habits squeeze businesses. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: \u201cThis year there has been more discounting than ever before from retailers in the run-up to Christmas, as Black Friday deals extended into more severe festive promotions to try and boost lacklustre sales volumes. \u201cUnfortunately the swaths of cut-price deals seem to have had little effect, with levels of financial distress among retailers even higher than last year\u2019s shocking statistics.\u201d Palmer said that retailers were now hoping for a last-minute rush to the shops before Christmas, as well as a boost from the Boxing Day and January sales. She added: \u201cWith most of the UK\u2019s parcels carriers still working through backlogs from earlier in the month and many consumers still haunted by last year\u2019s delivery disappointments following the administration of City Link on Christmas Eve, we expect to see a late surge of shoppers hitting the streets this week to get their hands on some last-minute bargains before the big day.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "House prices in some parts of the UK could increase by as much as 8% in 2016 as the recovery that has taken hold in London ripples out across the country. The strong jobs market in Cambridge and the area\u2019s commuter links to London are forecast to put East Anglia at the forefront of growth, with an 8% average rise, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). It has forecast a 6% rise in prices on average across the UK next year, with growth in all parts of the country. Rics said supply issues would continue to dominate the private housing market, leading to an increase in prices likely to outstrip any rises in household income. For most of the year, Rics\u2019 members have been reporting a dearth of homes coming onto the market for sale, and the average number of properties on agents\u2019 books has fallen to a record low of 46. A survey found that 40% thought the lack of stock was itself the main reason sellers were not entering the market, leading to a vicious circle in the market. The lowest level of increase is forecast for the north-east of England, where prices are forecast to rise by 3%. After East Anglia, the strongest growth is expected to be in the south-east and the West Midlands, where 7% rises are forecast. Areas with the highest number of transactions are likely to be the north-east, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where prices remain low relative to the rest of the UK. The 6% rise would add \u00a317,220 to the \u00a3287,000 cost of an average UK home as measured by the Office for National Statistics. Rics chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said that within East Anglia strong price growth was likely to be centred on Cambridge and areas within London\u2019s commuter zone. \u201cTo a large extent it is a reflection of the strength of the underlying economy in the area,\u201d he said. A year ago, Rics forecast a 3% rise in prices in 2015, but it recently admitted growth was likely to be double that. Rubinsohn said he had expected more transactions, particularly after the uncertainty of the general election was out of the way. Looking ahead to 2016, he has factored in a 0.25 percentage point rise in interest rates during the course of the year, and said he did not expect there to be a big rise in mortgage rates. In the rental market, Rics said it expected the average cost of renting a home to go up by 3%. \u201cHousing has clearly leapt up the government\u2019s agenda, but despite the raft of initiatives announced over the past year the lags involved in development mean that prices, and for that matter rents, are likely to rise further over the next 12 months,\u201d he said. \u201cLack of stock will continue to be the principal driver of this trend but the likely persistence of cheap money will compound it for the time being. \u201cCritically our principal concern with the measures announced by the government is that they are overly focused on promoting home ownership at the expense of other tenures. \u201cDiscouraging buy to let could see private rents take even more of the strain if institutional investment doesn\u2019t increase significantly, particularly given the likely reduced flows of social rent property going forward.\u201d",

Rics said supply issues <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/12/property-buyers-slowdown-rics-weather-sale-prices\">would continue to dominate</a> the private housing market, leading to an increase in prices likely to outstrip any rises in household income.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/18/hottest-property-market-outside-london-margate-rightmove\">The hottest property market outside London in 2015? Margate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For most of the year, Rics\u2019 members have been reporting a dearth of homes coming onto the market for sale, and the average number of properties on agents\u2019 books has fallen to a record low of 46. A survey found that 40% thought the lack of stock was itself the main reason sellers were not entering the market, leading to a vicious circle in the market.</p> <p>The lowest level of increase is forecast for the north-east of England, where prices are forecast to rise by 3%. After East Anglia, the strongest growth is expected to be in the south-east and the West Midlands, where 7% rises are forecast. Areas with the highest number of transactions are likely to be the north-east, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where prices remain low relative to the rest of the UK. </p> <p>The 6% rise would add \u00a317,220 to the \u00a3287,000 cost of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/15/house-price-growth-speeding-up-ons-buy-to-let\">an average UK home</a> as measured by the Office for National Statistics. </p> <p>Rics chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said that within East Anglia strong price growth was likely to be centred on Cambridge and areas within London\u2019s commuter zone. \u201cTo a large extent it is a reflection of the strength of the underlying economy in the area,\u201d he said. </p> <p>A year ago, Rics forecast a 3% rise in prices in 2015, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/10/uk-house-prices-will-end-year-higher-surveyors-rics\">it recently admitted</a> growth was likely to be double that. Rubinsohn said he had expected more transactions, particularly after the uncertainty of the general election was out of the way. </p> <p>Looking ahead to 2016, he has factored in a 0.25 percentage point rise in interest rates during the course of the year, and said he did not expect there to be a big rise in mortgage rates. In the rental market, Rics said it expected the average cost of renting a home to go up by 3%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/20/uk-home-buyers-save-24-years-housing-ladder-deposit-study\">UK buyers need to save for up to 24 years to get on housing ladder</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cHousing has clearly leapt up the government\u2019s agenda, but despite the raft of initiatives announced over the past year the lags involved in development mean that prices, and for that matter rents, are likely to rise further over the next 12 months,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cLack of stock will continue to be the principal driver of this trend but the likely persistence of cheap money will compound it for the time being.</p> <p>\u201cCritically our principal concern with the measures announced by the government is that they are overly focused on promoting home ownership at the expense of other tenures.</p> <p>\u201cDiscouraging buy to let could see private rents take even more of the strain if institutional investment doesn\u2019t increase significantly, particularly given the likely reduced flows of social rent property going forward.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
