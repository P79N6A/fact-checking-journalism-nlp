      "bodyText": "As hooded Easter week penitents processed mournfully through Spain's cities on Good Friday, Spaniards were wondering just how much past economic sins will come back to haunt them. With bond yields hitting records for the year and the most austere budget in decades bringing further pain to a country already stricken by 24% unemployment, prayers for deliverance are unlikely to be answered any time soon. Analysts increasingly believe that like the other \"sick men\" of Europe \u2013 Ireland, Greece and Portugal \u2013 Spain will eventually need bailing out. For some, it has already become too much. Last week, Diego Salazar carted dozens of cardboard boxes of books from his Madrid apartment to the aptly named La Realidad (\"Reality\") bar and began selling them off at \u20ac3 an item. \"This just doesn't work any more,\" said Salazar, a Peruvian who has worked as a journalist, writer and editor in Madrid for more than a decade. \"I'm going back to Lima and I can't take the books with me.\" Analysts suspect Spain will need aid from the so-called troika \u2013 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 that most recently rode to the rescue of Greece for a second time. \"Spain is likely, in our view, to be pushed into a troika programme of some sort during 2012,\" according to analysts at Citigroup. Spain's government, meanwhile, tried to outdo the spiky-hatted nazareno penitents by putting on a public display of self-chastisement aimed at convincing sceptics about the seriousness of its deficit-cutting measures. \"First the deficit, second the deficit, third the deficit,\" intoned budget minister Crist\u00f3bal Montoro as he gave details of \u20ac27bn (\u00a322bn) of cuts, tax hikes and extraordinary measures for this year. In an attempt not to inflict too much damage on the economy, Montoro included a tax amnesty in the budget, allowing those who have been cheating the revenue to pay a one-off 10% tax on their hidden money. this has been conceived as a way of belatedly cashing in on the spectacular residential construction boom \u2013 a bubble, that four years after it burst, has left building companies and developers saddled with huge loans they can not repay. The same is not true of the underground economy, where \u20ac500 notes readily changed hands during the boom. Montoro hopes some \u20ac2.5bn of this black-market cash will find its way back to the exchequer. If the measure fails, further cuts will become inevitable. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy admitted things had got out of hand during the boom, when regional governments and town halls competed with one another to spend riches generated by the housing bubble. \"We can't have twice as many airports as Germany \u2013 no one understands that,\" he said. \"Nor can we have sports pavilions all over the place, or conference halls and exhibition centres, at least not these days.\" He was referring, among other things, to the shiny new airports at Castell\u00f3n and Ciudad Real \u2013 two empty white elephants that are symbols of the wild spending encouraged by local politicians and now-bust savings banks during the boom years. The glut of toxic loans to developers, many still in the banking system, has forced a further round of consolidation, with the union of CaixaBank and Banca C\u00edvica now creating the country's biggest high street bank. Ministers insist the only way Spain can maintain its credibility in the markets is to meet the harsh demands of the eurozone's other finance ministers who have demanded Spain slash its deficit. Spain's finance minister, Luis de Guindos told the Wall Street Journal that his country faced a lose-lose situation. \"If you don't make enough adjustments, the markets will penalise you. But if you go too far, markets could also penalise you,\" he said, referring to the additional damage that an excessively tight budget could do to an economy already predicted to shrink 1.7% this year. The government's determination to obey eurozone diktats contrasts with the feeling on the street. During a general strike on 29 March, protesters began to target not just Rajoy's conservative People's party government, which has been in power for just over three months, but also Brussels and German chancellor Angela Merkel. \"It is hard to accept the way the Germans are behaving,\" said one Spanish analyst, who asked not be named. \"This week they celebrated the fact that their unemployment hadn't increased while everyone else's had. But don't they realise that what they are doing means they will be next?\" Rajoy's standing at home, dented by the general strike and poorer-than-expected election results in Andaluc\u00eda and Asturias, was further hurt by the way he boldly and unilaterally announced a \"realistic\" deficit target of 5.8% of GDP \u2013 only for angry eurozone ministers to force him to accept an even lower target of 5.3%. In private, officials admit Rajoy had made a foolish bid for fiscal sovereignty. \"That was very clumsily handled,\" said one. House prices, already down about 25% from their peak, are set to fall by the same amount again over the next two to three years. Estimates forecast that up to one in four mortgage-holders will be left in negative equity by the end of this year. Reforms introduced by de Guindos are forcing banks to realise losses and sell off the newly built homes they have accumulated from bankrupt developers. A fire sale of bank-owned property has seen eager buyers snapping up cut-price homes, but at the end of last year the country still had an estimated 700,000 new homes to sell off. Banks will hurt more as mortgage defaults grow and bad property loans are written off. It remains unclear as to whether current provisions and future profits will cover the hole \u2013 though analysts say Spain does not have an Irish-sized problem on its hands. But, while de Guindos insists Spain has to make sure that the markets do not lose hope in its future growth, some see the budget killing off many of those hopes. Investment in education, training and research, for example, has been slashed \u2013 squashing dreams of Spain becoming a modern, knowledge-based economy. \"These figures are scary, precisely because the idea of this fiscal adjustment is meant to be to allow us to return to sustainable growth,\" said economists Florentino Felgueroso and Sergi Jim\u00e9nez in a blogpost, pointing to cuts of 35% in training programmes and 26% in research funding. The estimates already point to this year's deficit-slashing budget taking 2% off Spanish growth. \"Official growth forecasts appear too optimistic to us,\" the Citigroup analysts warn. A deeper than expected recession, combined with the difficulty of forcing regional governments to shoulder their share of the burden, means many are sceptical that Spain can slash its deficit from 8.5% to 5.3% this year. Spain's national debt may still be lower than most eurozone countries, at an estimated 80% of GDP by the end of the year, but the prospect of missing a deficit target would help push bond yields to dangerous, and possibly unsustainable, levels. Rajoy's government is seen as having tried hard to help recovery, including reform of the labour market, but this may have come too late. At his family's fruit and vegetable shop in Madrid, 22-year-old Valentin Mart\u00ednez agreed with Rajoy's verdict that Spain had lived beyond its means. \"I think we have all behaved like fools,\" he said. \"My father earned lots of money working in construction, but he spent it all. Now he's a car park attendant.\"",

Last week, Diego Salazar carted dozens of cardboard boxes of books from his Madrid apartment to the aptly named La Realidad (\"Reality\") bar and began selling them off at \u20ac3 an item. \"This just doesn't work any more,\" said Salazar, a Peruvian who has worked as a journalist, writer and editor in Madrid for more than a decade. \"I'm going back to Lima and I can't take the books with me.\"</p> <p>Analysts suspect Spain will need aid from the so-called troika \u2013 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 that most recently rode to the rescue of Greece for a second time. \"Spain is likely, in our view, to be pushed into a troika programme of some sort during 2012,\" according to analysts at Citigroup.</p> <p>Spain's government, meanwhile, tried to outdo the spiky-hatted <em>nazareno</em> penitents by putting on a public display of self-chastisement aimed at convincing sceptics about the seriousness of its deficit-cutting measures. \"First the deficit, second the deficit, third the deficit,\" intoned budget minister Crist\u00f3bal Montoro as he gave details of \u20ac27bn (\u00a322bn) of cuts, tax hikes and extraordinary measures for this year.</p> <p>In an attempt not to inflict too much damage on the economy, Montoro included a tax amnesty in the budget, allowing those who have been cheating the revenue to pay a one-off 10% tax on their hidden money. this has been conceived as a way of belatedly cashing in on the spectacular residential construction boom \u2013 a bubble, that four years after it burst, has left building companies and developers saddled with huge loans they can not repay.</p> <p>The same is not true of the underground economy, where \u20ac500 notes readily changed hands during the boom. Montoro hopes some \u20ac2.5bn of this black-market cash will find its way back to the exchequer. If the measure fails, further cuts will become inevitable.</p> <p>Prime minister Mariano Rajoy admitted things had got out of hand during the boom, when regional governments and town halls competed with one another to spend riches generated by the housing bubble. \"We can't have twice as many airports as Germany \u2013 no one understands that,\" he said. \"Nor can we have sports pavilions all over the place, or conference halls and exhibition centres, at least not these days.\" He was referring, among other things, to the shiny new airports at Castell\u00f3n and Ciudad Real \u2013 two empty white elephants that are symbols of the wild spending encouraged by local politicians and now-bust savings banks during the boom years.</p> <p>The glut of toxic loans to developers, many still in the banking system, has forced a further round of consolidation, with the union of CaixaBank and Banca C\u00edvica now creating the country's biggest high street bank.</p> <p>Ministers insist the only way Spain can maintain its credibility in the markets is to meet the harsh demands of the eurozone's other finance ministers who have demanded Spain slash its deficit. Spain's finance minister, Luis de Guindos told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> that his country faced a lose-lose situation. \"If you don't make enough adjustments, the markets will penalise you. But if you go too far, markets could also penalise you,\" he said, referring to the additional damage that an excessively tight budget could do to an economy already predicted to shrink 1.7% this year.</p> <p>The government's determination to obey eurozone diktats contrasts with the feeling on the street. During a general strike on 29 March, protesters began to target not just Rajoy's conservative People's party government, which has been in power for just over three months, but also Brussels and German chancellor Angela Merkel. \"It is hard to accept the way the Germans are behaving,\" said one Spanish analyst, who asked not be named. \"This week they celebrated the fact that their unemployment hadn't increased while everyone else's had. But don't they realise that what they are doing means they will be next?\"</p> <p>Rajoy's standing at home, dented by the general strike and poorer-than-expected election results in Andaluc\u00eda and Asturias, was further hurt by the way he boldly and unilaterally announced a \"realistic\" deficit target of 5.8% of GDP \u2013 only for angry eurozone ministers to force him to accept an even lower target of 5.3%. In private, officials admit Rajoy had made a foolish bid for fiscal sovereignty. \"That was very clumsily handled,\" said one.</p> <p>House prices, already down about 25% from their peak, are set to fall by the same amount again over the next two to three years. Estimates forecast that up to one in four mortgage-holders will be left in negative equity by the end of this year. Reforms introduced by de Guindos are forcing banks to realise losses and sell off the newly built homes they have accumulated from bankrupt developers.</p> <p>A fire sale of bank-owned property has seen eager buyers snapping up cut-price homes, but at the end of last year the country still had an estimated 700,000 new homes to sell off. Banks will hurt more as mortgage defaults grow and bad property loans are written off. It remains unclear as to whether current provisions and future profits will cover the hole \u2013 though analysts say Spain does not have an Irish-sized problem on its hands.</p> <p>But, while de Guindos insists Spain has to make sure that the markets do not lose hope in its future growth, some see the budget killing off many of those hopes. Investment in education, training and research, for example, has been slashed \u2013 squashing dreams of Spain becoming a modern, knowledge-based economy. \"These figures are scary, precisely because the idea of this fiscal adjustment is meant to be to allow us to return to sustainable growth,\" said economists Florentino Felgueroso and Sergi Jim\u00e9nez in a blogpost, pointing to cuts of 35% in training programmes and 26% in research funding.</p> <p>The estimates already point to this year's deficit-slashing budget taking 2% off Spanish growth. \"Official growth forecasts appear too optimistic to us,\" the Citigroup analysts warn.</p> <p>A deeper than expected recession, combined with the difficulty of forcing regional governments to shoulder their share of the burden, means many are sceptical that Spain can slash its deficit from 8.5% to 5.3% this year. Spain's national debt may still be lower than most eurozone countries, at an estimated 80% of GDP by the end of the year, but the prospect of missing a deficit target would help push bond yields to dangerous, and possibly unsustainable, levels.</p> <p>Rajoy's government is seen as having tried hard to help recovery, including reform of the labour market, but this may have come too late. At his family's fruit and vegetable shop in Madrid, 22-year-old Valentin Mart\u00ednez agreed with Rajoy's verdict that Spain had lived beyond its means. \"I think we have all behaved like fools,\" he said. \"My father earned lots of money working in construction, but he spent it all. Now he's a car park attendant.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Those members of the Blairite right who are urging the Labour leadership to become more credible by matching the coalition's cuts programme are doing themselves, their party and the country no good. The crux of the matter is that the coalition's economic policy is itself not credible: as manifested in last autumn's major revisions to the economic forecasts, the policy has already been found out. Moreover the Office for Budget Responsibility's recent forecasts show that the effects on demand of George Osborne's latest venture are, as one official has conceded, \"not significantly different from zero\". There you have it: a rightwing Conservative government, with the thin disguise of a coalition partner, continues to pursue policies of austerity; it weeps crocodile tears about the problem of socially wasteful and dangerously high unemployment \u2013 especially among the under 25s \u2013 but persists with a policy of expansionary fiscal contraction (allegedly allowing the private sector to flourish by cutting public spending), which was discredited in the 1930s and is being discredited now. The tragedy is that the present chancellor has painted himself, and the rest of us, into a corner. He presents himself as a sacrificial victim to the financial markets and the ratings agencies by rashly offering the entire British economy to be judged by the success of his outdated strategy. This chancellor cannot publicly conduct a U-turn, because he has in effect committed himself not to do so. Officials quietly point out that things need not be as bad as all that, because, after all, there are the so-called automatic stabilisers. Despite the ferocity of the assault on the public sector, with four-fifths of the cuts still to come, there will be some leeway: as unemployment rises, and with it costs in the form of more social security claims and lost tax revenue, there will not be attempts to offset the automatic mitigation of the squeeze. Indeed, as a result of these automatic stabilisers, with growth lower than expected (by them: not by some of us), the deficit has already swollen well beyond plans, which makes a laughing stock of government claims that you cannot borrow your way out of recession \u2013 except that, in this case, they seem to be borrowing their way into prolonged recession. In effect, this government has embarked on a policy of what one might call automatic destabilisation. At a recent seminar at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Adam Posen, a lively member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, drew attention to a point which has also been made in this column: the reason why the US economy has been recovering and ours has not can be explained largely by its different stance on economic and financial policy. And that redoubtable Labour party veteran, Austin Mitchell MP, points out in an interesting new publication, The Red Book (Searching Finance) that \"George Osborne assumed that what had worked for Thatcher (fighting inflation) would work for him (fighting deflation). He didn't seem to understand that Thatcherism seemed to work only because North Sea oil rescued her from her own follies. Obsessed by debt, he also failed to realise that Britain faced\u2026 a collapse in demand for which very different remedies were needed.\" Now, obviously the government has not caused the rise in oil prices that has eaten into real incomes and had a major depressing effect on consumer spending. The problem is that it has aggravated that effect, with a premature increase in VAT and a premature austerity programme. The time to raise taxes and apply extra rigour to the control of public spending is when a recovery is well under way. Unfortunately a recovery does not get well under way if a government does everything to prevent it, both by its actions and its confidence-sapping rhetoric. But what about sustaining the confidence of those markets and ratings agencies? Lawrence Summers, the US economist, has come up with the idea of \"contingent commitments\". These are policies that would commit a government, and central bank, to act \"to normalise conditions\", but only when \"some threshold with respect to unemployment or expected inflation is crossed\". He was writing in a US context, but his suggestions are not irrelevant to the UK. Now, I referred some time ago to the way that the late Lord Robbins, a most distinguished economist, who had opposed Keynes over economic policy in the 1930s, later conceded that Keynes had been right. The economist Susan Howson has written a magnificent life and times of Robbins for Cambridge University Press. George Osborne should study it. So should most policymakers in the eurozone. Writing after the second world war, Robbins said: \"I think many of us \u2013 certainly I was one \u2013 were too scared of the inflationary effect of expanding expenditure in a state of underemployment and consequently we handled with gloves instruments we should have grasped with bare hands.\" There is a lot more where that comes from.",

The move prompted talk that it was being prepared for a sale \u2013 and some suggest the current publicity drive, with Metheringham taking a higher-profile role, could point to the same thing. \"People are always speculating about that,\" she says. There was talk that Millen herself might try to buy back the brand. Asked about this, Metheringham says only: \"I don't think that was ever a serious proposition.\"</p> <p>Sitting in her office at the top of a building occupied by all of the Aurora companies, Metheringham says the brand has not changed since it gained its independence. \"It's possibly not the right answer for the board downstairs but I always thought we were independent. I've always been sitting up on the sixth floor saying, 'Of course we're very different from the other Aurora brands, the whole way we work is different'.\"</p> <p>Instead of having buyers, Karen Millen designs all of its clothes in the UK. Unusually, it also has its own pattern cutters. These are the people that turn a design into an item of clothing. Metheringham is fiercely proud of this side of the business and eagerly gives me a tour of the pattern room \u2013 a huge light-filled workshop, littered with dummies, all draped in material, some closer to resembling finished items than others.</p> <p>In the same room sit the graders, who adjust each piece of a garment so that they fit a size 6 as well as they do a size 16. You can't, apparently, just shrink or expand each piece by the same amount.</p> <p>\"I think sometimes pattern cutting and technical are the unsung heroes,\" says Metheringham, who worries that their skills are rapidly disappearing. \"We are trying to do something that keeps the craft alive and it becomes more and more difficult to find people with the skills in the UK to do that.\"</p> <p>Karen Millen employs some 1,100 people in the UK, with 200 in head office and the rest in shops. The manufacturing is done abroad, about half in China and half in eastern Europe. Metheringham says this is not just for financial reasons. \"I think it would be difficult to find the people who were prepared to take the trouble [in the UK]. Some of the clothes we make have up to 80 pattern pieces. Somebody's really got to be prepared to put that extra bit of skill into it.\"</p> <p>With factories abroad there is, of course, always the risk of inadequate working conditions. Metheringham visits the factories, but pauses when asked about what she finds there.</p> <p>\"I think it's very difficult, isn't it? To apply what we would consider to be our life standards to other people's standards in China.\" Karen Millen has signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative, an alliance of companies and NGOs that has developed a code of conduct, which is generally well-received among campaigners. \"I think you almost need to take that very professional approach to it,\" she says. \"I don't think you ever relax about it.\"</p> <p>As the global economy shifts, China is no longer just a manufacturing base for Karen Millen. The chain is opening stores in Beijing and Shanghai this year and has plans for 65 outlets there over the next five years. It is part of a major push that has seen it open shops in markets as unlikely as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.</p> <p>With dresses that sell for \u00a3125 and more in the UK, and import duties that will increase prices by up to 30% abroad, it is hard to see where the brand will sit in poorer markets. Metheringham says: \"What you've got around the world is an emerging middle class and within that you've got a whole set of women who are now working and wanting to buy themselves things. The brand is still pitched in a place where it is affordable.\"</p> <p>This overseas expansion is part of a strategy to double sales to \u00a3500m by 2016. Metheringham explains that growth must come from abroad to avoid flooding the UK market \"so the brand doesn't become distorted and overstretched. \"If you are really going to be an international brand, it's very important you protect your brand image in the market you're from.\"</p> <p>Metheringham claims she is no good with dates and numbers, peering through fashionable glasses at her \"crib sheets\" for various statistics, but it is clear she is commercially minded and keeps a tight grip on the brand.</p> <p>She adds: \"I see every single sketch that goes through the studio. I think it's really important that somebody holds the brand together. I am a sort of unlikely stepmother for Karen Millen.\" As is so often the case, mother and stepmother seem set to clash over who rules the roost.</p>",

You can't, apparently, just shrink or expand each piece by the same amount. \"I think sometimes pattern cutting and technical are the unsung heroes,\" says Metheringham, who worries that their skills are rapidly disappearing. \"We are trying to do something that keeps the craft alive and it becomes more and more difficult to find people with the skills in the UK to do that.\" Karen Millen employs some 1,100 people in the UK, with 200 in head office and the rest in shops. The manufacturing is done abroad, about half in China and half in eastern Europe. Metheringham says this is not just for financial reasons. \"I think it would be difficult to find the people who were prepared to take the trouble [in the UK]. Some of the clothes we make have up to 80 pattern pieces. Somebody's really got to be prepared to put that extra bit of skill into it.\" With factories abroad there is, of course, always the risk of inadequate working conditions. Metheringham visits the factories, but pauses when asked about what she finds there. \"I think it's very difficult, isn't it? To apply what we would consider to be our life standards to other people's standards in China.\" Karen Millen has signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative, an alliance of companies and NGOs that has developed a code of conduct, which is generally well-received among campaigners. \"I think you almost need to take that very professional approach to it,\" she says. \"I don't think you ever relax about it.\" As the global economy shifts, China is no longer just a manufacturing base for Karen Millen. The chain is opening stores in Beijing and Shanghai this year and has plans for 65 outlets there over the next five years. It is part of a major push that has seen it open shops in markets as unlikely as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. With dresses that sell for \u00a3125 and more in the UK, and import duties that will increase prices by up to 30% abroad, it is hard to see where the brand will sit in poorer markets. Metheringham says: \"What you've got around the world is an emerging middle class and within that you've got a whole set of women who are now working and wanting to buy themselves things. The brand is still pitched in a place where it is affordable.\" This overseas expansion is part of a strategy to double sales to \u00a3500m by 2016. Metheringham explains that growth must come from abroad to avoid flooding the UK market \"so the brand doesn't become distorted and overstretched. \"If you are really going to be an international brand, it's very important you protect your brand image in the market you're from.\" Metheringham claims she is no good with dates and numbers, peering through fashionable glasses at her \"crib sheets\" for various statistics, but it is clear she is commercially minded and keeps a tight grip on the brand. She adds: \"I see every single sketch that goes through the studio. I think it's really important that somebody holds the brand together. I am a sort of unlikely stepmother for Karen Millen.\" As is so often the case, mother and stepmother seem set to clash over who rules the roost.",

    "webTitle": "Can H&M really claim to be ethical?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "H&amp;M is not just a big player in \"fast fashion\", it's a giant. Estimates (fast fashion behemoths do not give out many production figures as the sector is intensely competitive) suggest it sells more than 550 million garments every year. It recently announced net quarterly profits of $412m. It is second only to Inditex, owner of Zara, as the world's largest clothing retailer. The great fast fashion war pits Sweden's richest man, Stefan Persson, chair of H&amp;M, against Spain's richest man, Amancio Ortega, co-founder of Zara. And now, in an audacious move, H&amp;M is positioning itself as the ethical solution, the retailer that can make ethics and fast fashion synonymous. It wants to be an ethical giant, too. I say \"audacious\" because, to concerned consumers and activists, fast fashion's rapid-response production system, reliant on low-wage production in some of the poorest countries on Earth, is pretty much held responsible for environmental and social degradation in the global wardrobe. Indeed, having spent a large amount of time railing against it myself, it felt pretty audacious for me, too, to be sitting in the Stockholm headquarters of H&amp;M last week. The Observer was given early access to the brand's latest sustainability report that will be published on 12 April. Few corporate CSR reports are read so widely. From activists to analysts, everyone will be keen to see if H&amp;M can really crack it. I am no different. However much I bang on about alternative ways to fill your wardrobe to ethically aware audiences \u2013 small brands, swapping, vintage, knitting \u2013 the top question I still get asked is: \"So which high street stores can I go to?\" Be in no doubt, we are addicted to fast fashion. So, if H&amp;M have solved all labour rights and environmental issues then I can pack up my soap box and toddle home, picking up some David Beckham underpants from his H&amp;M Bodywear collaboration from one of the brand's 199 UK stores with total impunity. But how clean are H&amp;M's Beckham pants? (On Twitter Joey Barton splendidly articulated lingering consumer unease: \"Do one, Becks. They cost about 1p to make in a sweat shop in the Third World.\") Indeed, what guarantees does H&amp;M offer across its ranges? \"I don't think guarantee is the right word,\" says Helena Helmersson, head of sustainability, brightly. \"A lot of people ask for guarantees: 'Can you guarantee labour conditions? Can you guarantee zero chemicals?' Of course we cannot when we're such a huge company operating in very challenging conditions. What I can say is that we do the very best we can with a lot of resources and a clear direction of what we're supposed to do. We're working really hard.\" I believe her. Thursday's report will show some impressive sustainable figures: for example nearly 2.5 million pairs of shoes were made last year using lower-impact water-based solvents; all building contractors have signed a code of conduct to ensure \"good\" working conditions; recycled polyester equivalent to 9.2 million plastic bottles has been used, and H&amp;M uses more organic cotton in production than any other group. This year I am told, 7.6% of its cotton was organic (an industry insider estimates H&amp;M's overall cotton use to be around 200,000 tonnes a year). By 2020 100% will be sustainably sourced cotton. \"H&amp;M has definitely got better,\" admits industry expert and CEO of Clothesource, Mike Flanagan. \"From some presposterous moments in the recent past they have moved to being in a small clutch of four or five brands, including Nike and Gap, who believe that they have no alternative but to be as good as possible at sustainability. It's a marked change.\" (The official word on the Beckham cruds is that this time they were made using conventional cotton and Elastane, but that H&amp;M hasn't ruled out \"using other [eco] materials for future collections\" and didn't publish a list of factories used in China and Cambodia due to commercial confidentiality.) Does Helmersson still wake up worried they'll be the subject of a sweated labour expose? \"Yes, I worry about that sometimes. I lived in Dhaka for two years. You see how things happen down the chain in a country like Bangladesh. Remember that H&amp;M does not own any factories itself. We are to some extent dependent on the suppliers \u2014 it is impossible to be in full control.\" And therein lies the rub. While H&amp;M talks about responsibility, in the supply chain where retailers devolve power to factories it can be easy to distance yourself. Helmersson says H&amp;M has invested in 100 people in CSR, 75 of whom are auditors (assessing social and now some environmental conditions in factories) and produced a series of groundbreaking short films, including one on fire safety that it claims more than 400,000 garment workers have seen. Sam Maher, of the NGO Labour Behind The Label, the UK platform for the international Clean Clothes Campaign, is not so impressed (although she is yet to see the latest 2011 report). \"I'd like to be at the point where unions can phone H&amp;M and talk through any labour disputes. The Clean Clothes Campaign should no longer need to exist. Sadly that's far from the case. DVDs 'educating' garment workers are all very well but I think workers know there is a problem. They aren't stupid. What's needed is proper dialogue with unions and freedom of association, long term investment and proper resources. It's not good enough to act unilaterally and say: 'We're Swedish and we do things very well.'\" What would change her mind? \"For starters I would like to see them signing the Clean Clothes Campaign's memorandum of understanding on fire and building safety in Bangladesh. PVH [owners of Tommy Hilfiger] has just signed but three more big signatories are needed. H&amp;M is currently considering it.\" There is of course another fashionably attired elephant in the fitting room: a business model predicated on producing millions of units and on a fashion cycle that favours 30 to 50 trend-driven fashion seasons a year (the original spring/summer and autumn/winter cycles are alien to fast fashion) are hardly a recipe for sustainability. Isn't ethical fast fashion just a big fat oxymoron? Helmersson says: \"It's a question of how can we make the fashion more sustainable? That's what we are working on in many ways to do that.\" To that end Thursday also sees the launch of the new Conscious Collection, with pieces made from eco-fibres ranging from organic cotton and recycled plastic bottles to Tencel (derived from plant cellulose) and a glamorous adjunct of \"eco\" pieces including a silky hemp, pieces that have been worn by celebrities on the red carpet (coincidentally this is a similar idea to the Green Carpet Challenge I co-founded with Livia Firth in order to up the profile of sustainable style). H&amp;M acknowledges there is more to do: \"We must close the loop on fibre. How can we see waste as a resource?\" emphasises Helmersson. \"You see my dream is to be perceived as a company who can offer all people in the world \u2013 even those without much money \u2013 the possibility to dress really well and sustainably. That's how I want people to perceive us, not as a brand connected to mass consumption.\" Full marks for ambition. But do I buy H&amp;M as an ethical paragon? Not quite yet. They are still clinging to too many parts of the fast-fashion supply chain to bring anything revolutionary. But I'm enjoying their new attitude and I remain open to persuasion.",

Romney and his ilk are doing wonderfully well, but the rest of the nation is still in deep trouble. Yet the US economy can't fully recover on the spending of millionaires. The president has already announced that this election is about America's surge toward ever-greater inequality. He's right. And this painful \"recovery\" shows that. It would be sadly ironic if Obama lost the upcoming election because the economy responded to widening inequality exactly as expected.",
