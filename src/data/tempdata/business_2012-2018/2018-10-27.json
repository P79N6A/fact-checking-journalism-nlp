      "bodyText": "This week The Economist magazine featured Australia on its front page, stating \u201cAussie Rules: What the world can learn from Australia\u201d. In some ways it is an oddly timed piece given the insecurities many in this country are feeling \u2013 coming as it did in a week when about 150,000 people rallied in Melbourne for better wages, and in which the stock market slid five days in a row. Is it a case that Australians have become the grumpy ones who can\u2019t see how good we have it, or is it time to end stories about the \u201cAustralian economic miracle\u201d? It\u2019s not all that surprising really to have a magazine based in London as it experiences the absurd hit on its economy from the Brexit idiocy look wistfully to Australia. And given this week Tony Abbott advised the Brits to just give the EU a take it or leave it offer, many in Britain could well be forgiven for wondering just how did Australia manage to not be in an economic mire given the competency bar for leadership in this country appears to be so low. If we look over the past decade, Australia\u2019s GDP per capita (not that I would suggest GDP tells all there is to be said about an economy) has grown by 10.2% compared to the UK\u2019s meagre 3.9%. Whereas Australia over the past 10 years comes in 7th among OECD nations for per capita real growth, the UK comes 20th. And yet digging deeper (something which our economy certainly is reliant upon doing) the picture of Australia as this wonderfully performing economy looks like it was written about five years ago rather than in 2018. Most of the reason for our good relative performance over the past decade is due to how well we did during the GFC. In the three years from the last quarter of 2007 to December 2010 Australia was one of only six nations in the OECD not to see their GDP per capita go backwards. While our per capita economy grew 1.6%, the UK\u2019s fell 5.8%. So well done us \u2013 great stimulus, some good fortune from China\u2019s own stimulus, not to mention a much better banking system than in the USA and UK. But here is the dirty secret \u2013 since the end of the GFC, Australia has been far from an economic powerhouse. Since 2010 our economy on a per capita basis has actually grown in line with that of the UK, and behind the USA. The IMF also recently predicted that over the next five years both the USA and UK would outperform us \u2013 and that is in spite of Brexit and Trump\u2019s tax cuts inevitably leading to a massive cut in government spending. Yet there is little sense of this in The Economist\u2019s article. Instead all appears rosy, but very oddly so. Consider that the author of the piece, Edward McBride, suggests that \u201cwhereas many other rich countries have seen wages stagnate for decades, Australia\u2019s have grown strongly\u201d, although he does at least acknowledge that \u201calbeit less steadily in recent years\u201d. He thus argues that \u201cin other words, a problem that has agitated policymakers \u2013 and voters \u2013 around the world, and has been blamed for all manner of political upheaval, from European populism to the election of Donald Trump, scarcely exists in Australia.\u201d Really? Scarcely exists? From the start of 2011 till the middle of 2017, private sector wages growth fell and real household incomes have been flat now for over six years. The Reserve Bank and the Treasury are both worried and somewhat perplexed why wages aren\u2019t growing, given our low levels of unemployment, and it has reached such a state that 150,000 people protested in Melbourne this week on the issue. The union movement might be good at propaganda, but you don\u2019t get 150,000 people turning up to a rally during their lunchtime unless there is a real problem. Similarly the article has a rather rosy-coloured look at places that are actually struggling. Townsville is highlighted as being this wonderful place that has boomed from mining but thrived in spite of the end of the investment boom because of tourism and defence. McBride writes that \u201cwhen commodity prices began to slide a few years ago, Townsville\u2019s economy was dragged down, too ... unemployment rose from 5% in 2013 to 9% in 2016. Property prices sank\u201d. Except unemployment in Townsville didn\u2019t peak in 2016 \u2013 it kept going up, reaching an annual average of 11.6% in 2017. It is now back at 9.1%, but consider that in 2013 the unemployment rate in Townsville was 1.4 percentage points lower than the national rate and now it is more than 4 percentage points above it. Not really an example of a place that \u201cstumbled rather than swooned\u201d. The article also reveals rather unintentionally the issue at the heart of our economy. Yes mining has kept our GDP growing, but the jobs are not flowing as they did previously. In attempting to explain how efficient our mining sector is, McBride notes Rio Tinto\u2019s use of self-driving trucks and that they \u201care 15% cheaper to run than the human operated sort... There are no idle spells between shifts or during breaks, and there is no need to \ufb02y burly men in hard hats up from Perth.\u201d Quite \u2013 an efficient economy all without the need for people. The Economist article does at least acknowledge Australia\u2019s utter lack of a climate change policy under the Liberal party, and also that the \u201cappalling circumstances of many Aboriginals are a national embarrassment\u201d. It also notes that \u201cthe right-wing press likes to dwell misleadingly on stories about immigrants and crime. It has stirred up a panic about African gangs in Melbourne, despite scant evidence that any such gangs exist\u201d. McBride actually paints a more realistic picture of Australia\u2019s thriving multicultural society. But there is no mention of the concerns about house prices, housing affordability and our large levels of household debt \u2013 something that the Reserve Bank has highlighted as a concern should the world economy slow. Yes, Australia\u2019s economy has done well over the past 25 years, but it seems an odd time to point to the lessons we can show the rest of the world. During the GFC we were indeed the poster boy of how to manage an economy, but ours now, as much as others, is suffering through the new normal of lower growth and flat incomes. Our economy is also more dependent upon fossil fuels than almost any major economy, and yet we continue to do almost the least to reduce our emissions. Of this major economic challenge facing the world and very much this nation, our own Treasury department this week told the Senate estimates committee it wasn\u2019t even doing any modelling on the impact. If anything we can teach the world that short-termism of looking at GDP growth now and ignoring problems bubbling under the surface and looming large on the horizon is the way to go. But I am not sure that is a lesson anyone should wish to learn.",

      "bodyText": "It is often said that people are defined by their work. Whether the job is in mining, teaching or engineering, it provides an income, status, friends and a sense of community. Yet for a long time now work has become secondary to being a savvy consumer, a homeowner (or, better still, a multiple homeowner) and a pension saver. It\u2019s not a trend the Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party recognises. But it\u2019s a sad fact that a job is no longer the primary route to a better life, unless promotions \u2013 which often only add to the stress and long hours that employers already demand \u2013 are part of the plan. If workers have any spare time, it doesn\u2019t go into campaigning in their workplace for better terms and conditions. It is spent in the long queue at Aldi and Lidl for cheaper food. It is spent scouring the newspaper best-buy tables for a cheaper mortgage deal, a lower energy tariff or discounted car insurance. And if there is a hint of a cut to a worker\u2019s pension, they will leap up and vote for the party that promises to protect their entitlements, and even consider industrial action. In part, this change reflects a rolling back of labour laws and with them the sense of solidarity among workers. It also follows the shift to an economic model that relies on workers to be more accommodating each year in their role as business and consumer service providers. The irony is that when the consumer is made king, workers are forced to become even more flexible, providing services on a 24-hour cycle, usually to the detriment of their own health and wellbeing. Some politicians have sensed that the tide is turning, and that workers have had enough of flat wage growth and employers that seek to improve profits almost exclusively at their expense. It was clear once the promised bounceback from the financial crash failed to materialise that the trend for ever-worsening conditions and meagre pay needed to change. George Osborne\u2019s answer as chancellor was just to raise the minimum wage. Theresa May\u2019s speech on taking office was to argue that workers should be more actively involved in the workplace. She even pledged to give workers seats on boards, putting them at the heart of corporate decision-making. Corbyn\u2019s rise to the top of the Labour party has also brought with it an emphasis on workers and workers\u2019 rights. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has a vision of an economy made up of cooperatives and worker-influenced corporations, with staff owning shares and using them to influence the direction of travel. The gig economy will be reined in with extra employment protections, he says. The privatisation of industries by Margaret Thatcher and John Major will be reversed, with workers given at least some control. To provide some intellectual ballast, the IPPR thinktank\u2019s recent report on economic justice hammers home a message of hope around the re-emergence of the worker, back at the heart of corporate life. This is a conversation young people are having after years of being told they should be grateful to be employed at all. Young people, however, have very little influence at work: the baby-boomer generation runs things. Now 54 years old or more, its members started out as workers and might even have belonged to a trade union. They cared about their pay and how their boss behaved. But then they switched to consumption as a route to status: they are now primarily property owners, pension savers or pension receivers. Before any angry baby-boomers declare that they are still union members and care deeply about their colleagues\u2019 pay and conditions \u2013 or that they put their personal finances second to considerations like the environment \u2013 it is clear they are in the minority. There are so many indicators that the majority of their peers \u2013 fearful of the future, determined to maintain their living standards \u2013 put their wealth before the workplace that there isn\u2019t space to discuss them all. That is why May can get away with ignoring her pledge to put workers on boards \u2013 it is obvious there are not as many votes in it as her advisers thought. And if there were a groundswell of opinion in favour, it is neutered by a lack of faith in today\u2019s trade unions, most of which are far more concerned with internal Labour politics than with addressing the declining terms and conditions of their members. Industrial action \u2013 last week\u2019s equal pay strike in Scotland aside \u2013 is taken almost exclusively to protect pension entitlements. Unfortunately, the most experienced and better-off workers are still too busy shopping and saving to confront the boss.",

      "bodyText": "The shoppers are out in force at the start of half-term in Wigan. The autumn sun is low in the sky and the drizzle that can drench south Lancashire \u2013 the kind that made the air here perfect for spinning cotton a century ago \u2013 has stopped. For a town that is among the hardest-hit by council budget cuts, according to a recent Cambridge University study, there is little evidence of austerity on a day like today. The town appears to be doing well, despite some derelict buildings among the bars and nightclubs on King Street, the complaints over the three-weekly bin collections, and the decrepit state of the often-delayed trains to Manchester. Beneath the surface, though, the deep cuts to local government spending are fraying the town\u2019s social fabric. Labour councils in the north of England have been hit harder than their leafy Conservative equivalents in the south: council spending in Wigan has been slashed by 43% after inflation, compared with an average of 24% nationally, according to the Cambridge study. Theresa May promised an end to austerity at the Conservative party conference, and her chancellor, Philip Hammond, is under pressure to show Wigan and the rest of the country that the belt-tightening is over. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons it will take \u00a319bn of spending to make that a reality, which could mean more borrowing or higher taxes. He must also find the funds to meet May\u2019s other pre-budget promise: to raise NHS spending by \u00a320bn by 2023. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence of austerity ending, especially in the north,\u201d said Robin Howard, a retired psychiatric nurse out shopping with his wife and grandchildren. \u201cWe seem to be forgotten.\u201d Sitting on a stone seat opposite the Moon Under Water, a Wetherspoon pub named after the ideal public house as described by George Orwell (who knew a thing or two about Wigan), Howard said the impact of austerity was clear beyond the busier parts of town: \u201cThe most noticeable thing is the people sleeping in the streets. Then the working poor \u2013 which is an amazing thing to have to say in this day and age. If you work, you shouldn\u2019t have to be poor, but people are. A lot of people are reliant on benefits.\u201d Wigan council has seen its budget cut by \u00a3160m since 2010, owing to loss of funding from Westminster and the need to save a further \u00a326m by 2022. Despite this, the council argues that residents still get the services they need thanks to \u201cthe de al,\u201d a scheme to cut demand for services strangely similar to David Cameron\u2019s 2010 \u201cbig society\u201d vision. The idea was for community groups and charities to take up much of the slack, running libraries and homeless centres in this town famed for rugby league and a strong community spirit. The council reckons it was this that prevented Wigan from following crisis-hit Northamptonshire into effective bankruptcy, despite greater funding cuts. Could a flagship Tory policy have worked in this staunch Labour town, with the miners\u2019 strikes and Margaret Thatcher still within living memory? \u201cNo. David Cameron\u2019s idea came from a Labour policy in Wigan. Simple as,\u201d said council leader David Molyneux, sitting alongside chief executive Donna Hall in a council office housed in a splendid Edwardian former mining college. \u201cIn fact, we run it a lot better than Cameron even had any vision for. \u201cThere have been cases up and down the country where people have felt sorry for themselves and delayed making the choices they needed to make. Wigan didn\u2019t do that. Wigan got on with it.\u201d That\u2019s not to say the council has managed without the money entirely: \u201cWe\u2019d like our \u00a3160m back, and we would, could and should do more. We, like other northern towns, have suffered quite significantly.\u201d Wigan was a pilot location for the rollout of universal credit, which local charities say has added to its social problems. Non-council services have also been hacked back: there are 2,000 fewer police officers in Greater Manchester, a lack of funding for the NHS, and promised transport investment that melted away. Lisa Nandy, the town\u2019s Labour MP, said there had been a 10% cut in the number of buses on routes the council operates since 2010. The 134-year-old post office is at risk of closure, Marks &amp; Spencer is considering leaving the town centre and more than 100 cash machines have gone. \u201cWe have a major problem with universal credit,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are absolutely battered by this government \u2013 stripped of agency, dignity, control, and just the means to survive, sometimes.\u201d Louise Green, who runs The Brick, a poverty charity in the town, said it helped 2,000 people at its crisis intervention centre last year and more than 60 people on its \u201cno second night out\u201d rough-sleeping programme. Universal credit has made things worse: \u201cWe used to see mainly single men; now we see families. If austerity had ended, the food bank would shut down. The crisis intervention centre would close too.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t look likely when up to 200 food parcels are being handed out each week. Wigan is at the centre of a patchwork of former coal-mining towns, where slag heaps and flashes of water caused by collapsed tunnels are visible reminders of the hundreds of pits that once operated here. The mill town of Leigh, seven miles away, has been hit even harder by austerity than Wigan. Both voted overwhelmingly for Brexit two years ago, returning the biggest Leave majority in Greater Manchester and Merseyside. Leigh sits on a spur of the Leeds-Liverpool canal, its skyline dominated by derelict cotton mills. With about 43,000 residents, it is one of the largest places in Britain not to have a railway station, and recently ranked 533 out of 533 English constituencies for the social mobility chances of its youngest residents. Andy Burnham was MP for Leigh before becoming the first directly elected mayor of Greater Manchester, which is 40 minutes away by a guided busway that opened in 2016 after years of delays. His successor, Jo Platt, said that many people did not immediately draw the link between the cuts handed down from Westminster and services in Wigan. \u201cThey don\u2019t connect the national with the local,\u201d she said. \u201cThey blame the council as they had been wrapped in its services for years. It\u2019s not the Conservatives\u2019 cuts as they see it \u2013 it\u2019s the council\u2019s.\u201d Bill Naismith, riding a disability scooter on Railway Road \u2013 in a town that hasn\u2019t had a train service since before the first man landed on the moon in 1969 \u2013 tells her: \u201cIt\u2019s gone to the dogs. Leigh has had a big decline over the years.\u201d As Platt walks around it only takes her a few minutes for her to bump into two homeless men on the main shopping street, Bradshawgate, where several shops lie empty. One of them is a former block paver, now homeless (on a street where Wigan council recently spent \u00a31m on new block paving). \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this in the 1990s,\u201d he said, adding that rough sleepers in Leigh came from as far afield as Blackpool, Preston and Merseyside. The economic renaissance of Manchester and the construction of HS2 to Wigan could help the borough over the coming years, yet Platt points out that it will be quicker to travel to Birmingham from Wigan once HS2 arrives. \u201cTrickle-down economics do not work \u2013 not from Manchester, and not even from Wigan.\u201d Molyneux reckoned that few in May\u2019s cabinet were likely to have much idea what the prime minister meant when she proclaimed the end of austerity. He has an idea of where May could make a start: \u201cIf she\u2019s going to end austerity, she needs to make sure that certainly the north of England, and places like Wigan, get the finances they need.\u201d What will the chancellor do? On Monday Philip Hammond will deliver what is likely to be Britain\u2019s final budget as a member of the EU. He has been asked by Theresa May to find an extra \u00a320bn for the NHS and show that austerity is ending by Theresa May. Many believe he will refuse to take politically difficult choices, given the narrow electoral arithmetic after the Tories lost their parliamentary majority last year. Brexit Due to dire forecasts of the economic consequences of failing to reach agreement with the EU by the 29 March 2019 deadline, some changes are likely to wait until the prime minister has struck a deal. However, Hammond could warn that failure to agree Brexit terms could wreck the public finances and make it harder to afford increased public spending. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog, has also said it is not yet in a position to forecast the impact of Brexit before any deal, given that May has yet to reach a deal with Brussels. The end of austerity? The prime minister\u2019s promise in her party conference speech this month that austerity would end raised several eyebrows, given the Conservative track record for cutting public services and benefits over the past eight years. The Resolution Foundation thinktank reckons the government would need to spend an additional \u00a331bn to meet the pledge. This would include ensuring that further cuts to departments\u2019 day-to-day spending are brought to an end, that cuts to universal credit are reversed and that the final year of the benefits freeze is scrapped. Failure to remove the benefits freeze would hurt the lowest-income families most, with the average poor family with children losing about \u00a3200 next year. The NHS May promised to increase spending on the NHS by \u00a320bn by 2023, which is likely to be paid for by tax rises, rather than the \u201cBrexit dividend\u201d she once alluded to. To find the money, the chancellor could outline a range of tax changes. These could include freezing the income-tax threshold for higher-rate payers and ditching a plan to raise the tax-free personal allowance. Both measures could raise about \u00a32.5bn, so he would need to make other tweaks \u2013 perhaps changes to corporation tax, a digital sales tax or rules on self-employment. Economic growth Hammond will present the latest growth figures for the UK economy. Although GDP has been stronger than many would have credited before the referendum result, the economy has expanded at a slower rate than many other G7 countries. Freezing weather saw the economy grind to a halt earlier this year, before warm weather and England\u2019s extended stay at the World Cup helped to boost activity over the summer. The EY Item Club forecasting group, which uses the Treasury\u2019s model, reckons that 2018 is in line to be the worst year for growth in almost a decade. It forecasts growth of 1.3% for 2018 and 1.5% next year \u2013 conditional on a smooth Brexit transition, which is far from guaranteed. The public finances, however, have been stronger than expected, which could hand the chancellor about \u00a313bn in firepower for additional spending.",

He has been asked by Theresa May to find an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/16/may-to-unveil-20-billion-pound-a-year-nhs-boost\" title=\"\">extra \u00a320bn for the NHS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/theresa-may-conference-speech-ambasts-labour-as-she-calls-for-tory-unity\" title=\"\">show that austerity is ending</a> by Theresa May.</p> <p>Many believe he will refuse to take politically difficult choices, given the narrow electoral arithmetic after the Tories lost their parliamentary majority last year.</p> <p><strong>Brexit</strong><br>Due to dire forecasts of the economic consequences of failing to reach agreement with the EU by the 29 March 2019 deadline, some changes are likely to wait until the prime minister has struck a deal. However, Hammond could warn that failure to agree Brexit terms could wreck the public finances and make it harder to afford increased public spending.</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog, has also said it is not yet in a position to forecast the impact of Brexit before any deal, given that May has yet to reach a deal with Brussels.</p> <p><strong>The end of austerity?</strong><br>The prime minister\u2019s promise in her party conference speech this month that austerity would end raised several eyebrows, given the Conservative track record for cutting public services and benefits over the past eight years. The Resolution Foundation thinktank reckons the government would need to spend an additional \u00a331bn to meet the pledge. This would include ensuring that further cuts to departments\u2019 day-to-day spending are brought to an end, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/13/reverse-universal-credit-cuts-iain-duncan-smith-tells-chancellor\" title=\"\">cuts to universal credit are reversed</a> and that the final year of the benefits freeze is scrapped.</p> <p>Failure to remove the benefits freeze would hurt the lowest-income families most, with the average poor family with children losing about \u00a3200 next year.</p> <p><strong>The NHS</strong><br>May promised to increase spending on the NHS by \u00a320bn by 2023, which is likely to be paid for by tax rises, rather than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/17/theresa-may-nhs-funding-budget-rise-brexit\" title=\"\">\u201cBrexit dividend\u201d she once alluded to</a>. </p> <p>To find the money, the chancellor could outline a range of tax changes. These could include freezing the income-tax threshold for higher-rate payers and ditching a plan to raise the tax-free personal allowance. Both measures could raise about \u00a32.5bn, so he would need to make other tweaks \u2013 perhaps changes to corporation tax, a digital sales tax or rules on self-employment.</p> <p><strong>Economic growth</strong><br>Hammond will present the latest growth figures for the UK economy. Although GDP has been stronger than many would have credited before the referendum result, the economy has expanded at a slower rate than many other G7 countries.</p> <p>Freezing weather saw the economy grind to a halt earlier this year, before warm weather and England\u2019s extended stay at the World Cup helped to boost activity over the summer. The EY Item Club forecasting group, which uses the Treasury\u2019s model, reckons that 2018 is in line to be the worst year for growth in almost a decade. It forecasts growth of 1.3% for 2018 and 1.5% next year \u2013 conditional on a smooth Brexit transition, which is far from guaranteed.</p> <p>The public finances, however, have been stronger than expected, which could hand the chancellor about \u00a313bn in firepower for additional spending. </p>",
