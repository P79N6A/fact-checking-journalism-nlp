      "bodyText": "Investing easy? Take a look at the 20-year chart of the FTSE 100 index and you could be forgiven for thinking investing is easy. One only had to get two things right: buy when the index was below 4,000, which was the mid 1990s, 2003 and 2009; and sell when 7,000 was within sight \u2013 1999, when the dotcom bubble was about to burst, and 2007, just before the banking bust. So here we go again? London's blue-chip index came close to the 7,000 mark this week, and it's not hard to conjure up reasons why shares might be considered too expensive. The geopolitical weather in Iraq, Syria, Ukraine and Russia is terrible. The eurozone crisis rumbles along amid the new threat of deflation and with a central bank that, despite this week's display of resistance, may have left its response too late. Meanwhile, companies' profit margins are strong (albeit with important exceptions), but they may struggle to become stronger if consumers' real take-home pay doesn't improve more quickly. So, who knows? Selling the FTSE 100 at 7,000-ish might, once again, be the right card. Yet it feels all wrong. If we've learned anything in the past few years, it is never to underestimate central bankers' terror of upsetting financial markets. The US Federal Reserve is retreating from quantitative easing only via baby steps. In Japan, they're running in the other direction, and now the European Central Bank has adopted quasi-QE and may go for the real thing eventually. The era of cheap money, which inevitably washes through share prices, doesn't feel over just yet. Then there's the old-fashioned dividend calculation. Do you really want to own German 10-year bonds at a yield of 0.95%, or the French version at 1.25%, or even UK 10-year gilts at 2.5%, if you can own companies offering superior dividend income? The yield on the FTSE 100 stands at 3.5%. Dividend growth seems to be slowing, but examples of outright cutters like Tesco are rare; they are also balanced by the likes of Standard Life, which this week discovered it could sell its Canadian business for a whizzy price and return a fifth of the whole group's market capitalisation to shareholders. In terms of price-to-earnings, the FTSE 100's international collection is valued at about 13-times next year's expected earnings. Analysts' year-ahead guesses should be taken with a dose of salt, of course, since the perennial optimism discharged from corporate boardrooms can be dangerously infectious. Yet, if you believe 13 times, it makes the UK market seem neither cheap nor outrageously expensive either in historical terms. The guess here is that the FTSE 100 can continue to wander close to the 7,000 mark, and threaten to breach it, for some time yet. Yes vote would hit sterling, gilts and share prices The big get-out clause to the above is the Scottish referendum. Those UK economists issuing scary-sounding warnings this week are almost certainly right: the first impact of a surprise yes vote on 18 September would be a hit to sterling, gilts and share prices. Scots shouldn't worry on that score because the financial pros and cons of independence can only be weighed on long-term scales. Even Kevin Daly, Goldman Sachs's chief UK economist who warned of \"severely negative\" short and medium-term economic consequences for Scotland and the rest of the UK in the event of a yes vote, made the point that \"in the long run, we see little reason why an independent Scotland could not prosper\". But there's an interesting question about how the Bank of England and the big Scottish banks would react on 19 September if the result is \"yes\". Governor Mark Carney said a fortnight ago that there are contingency plans in place, but understandably declined to discuss them. Step one, though, seems obvious: loud assurances to depositors that there is no reason whatsoever to withdraw money from Scottish banks, coupled with a reminder that Threadneedle Street remains responsible for financial stability across the whole of the UK right up until the moment of separation, which would be 2016 at the earliest. As for Scottish banks themselves, their first response to a yes vote is equally clear. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds would have to declare that they will move their registered offices from Edinburgh to London as soon as they can get approval from the courts. The assets of the big two banks are 12 times as large as Scottish GDP, so there is no chance of an independent Scotland being able to act as a lender of last resort in a crisis. If there is doubt on the point, markets will jump on it and the banks' funding costs would soar. Whether a move of a registered office is merely a shift of a brass-plate, or would herald an on-the-ground exodus from Edinburgh's financial centre, is a debate in itself. Either way though, RBS, Lloyds and TSB would have to say within hours of a yes vote that, legally, they can't be Scottish. Dave Lewis's tame start at Tesco Dave Lewis, Tesco's new boss, doesn't like the nickname Drastic Dave, a hangover from his Unilever days, but he does enjoy his new employer's own-brand chilli fishcakes. Oh, and there will be a few management changes \u2013 but, given how far Tesco has fallen, it would be a surprise if there were not. Those were the highlights of Lewis's tame video interview with a colleague, shared on YouTube. There will be \"no hasty decisions\" and \"no knee jerk reactions\" because Lewis is in listening mode. A week into the job, most chief executives would be equally bland and noncommittal. All the same, investors will soon want something more strategically enlightening than this: \"It's about an enhanced customer experience and then making it economically viable in a way shareholders can appreciate.\" That's a motherhood and apple pie statement. Come on, the question is whether shareholders will have to surrender a big chunk of profits, which they won't appreciate, in order to enhance customers' lot via lower prices. At some point, a choice will have to be made \u2013 and it may have to be drastic.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US added 142,000 jobs in August, the lowest figure this year and one that ends a streak of months in which the economy added more than 200,000 new positions. The labour department's figures came as a surprise. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a gain of about 225,000. They correctly anticipated that the unemployment rate would fall to 6.1%, down from 6.2% and close to a six-year low. The US had added an average of 212,000 jobs each month over the prior 12 months. August's growth also did little to impact those worst hit by the recession. The unemployment rate for African Americans remained unchanged at 11.4%, more than twice the rate for white people, and Hispanic unemployment stayed flat at 7.5%. Teenage unemployment remained at 19.6%. The labour-force participation rate \u2013 which measures the percentage of the US population who are either working or looking for work \u2013 fell to 62.8% in August from July's 62.9%. The August rate matches the lowest level since the late 1970s and suggests many people may have given up looking for work. The dip is the likely explanation for the marginal fall in the unemployment rate. Investors reacted by selling shares and sending stock markets into reverse. The falls, while modest, ended a month-long surge in values in the US and across Europe. The FTSE 100 finished down 25 points at 6852. The US Dow Jones index fell to 17053 in early trading, down 16 points at 1700 BST. A two-month slide in the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies continued in response to the figures. Against the pound the dollar slipped to $1.63 compared to a year high of $1.71, which followed a 1.6% dive against the euro on Thursday to $1.29. The news was all the more surprising following a report on Friday from ADP, the US's largest payroll firm. According to its monthly tally of private sector hirings the US added 204,000 jobs in August, the fifth straight month of employment gains above 200,000. While the monthly number was disappointing, the longer-term trend remains positive. Gains now average 207,000 over the last three months. July's gain was revised up slightly to 212,000 from an earlier estimate of 209,000, though June's gain was revised down to 267,000 from an earlier estimate of 298,000. Brian Jones, US analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said the weak jobs figures would allow the Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen to keep critics of the central bank's low interest rate policy at bay. \"The lack of any pickup in headline wage growth, combined with the more sanguine inflation readings over the summer, suggests no urgency to revise the statement just yet. \"[Yellen] may acknowledge that a large part of the decline in the participation rate is structural, but is unlikely to abandon her longstanding thesis that there is still significant cyclical slack in the labour market,\" he said.",

Retail ecommerce sales in China totaled $132.61nn in 2013, according to eMarketer, and that figure is expected to increase another 63.9% in 2014 to reach $217.39bn. By 2017, eMarketer estimates, China will surpass the US as the largest retail ecommerce market in the world. Alibaba operates the Taobao and Tmall online marketplaces, which have hundreds of millions of users in China. Transactions at the two marketplaces topped $248bn last year, greater than comparable figures for Amazon and eBay combined. Last week Alibaba announced its overall revenue was $2.5b in the quarter ending 30 June, 46% higher than in the same period a year earlier. The company generated about $395m in mobile revenue in the latest quarter, up tenfold from a year earlier. However there have been complaints about the complexity of the company\u2019s accounting. Alibaba chose to debut on the NYSE after it could not get the Hong Kong exchange to agree a rule change that would allow the company to nominate the majority of its own board even after the share sale. Hong Kong is now considering changing its rules",

By the end of the year, after four years of EU-IMF mandated austerity, which has seen the Greek economy contract by more than 25 percent, it is expected to hit 175% of national output. </p> <p>The IMF has longed pressed for the country\u2019s debt problem to be resolved with Funds officials saying, openly, that a debt restructuring should have taken place earlier. In the two years from the onset of the debt crisis, when Athens received its first EU-IMF backed bailout, to the write-down that took place in 2012 (by far the biggest in global financial history) both the euro zone and Greece saw their economies go from bad to worse. European officials, not least in Berlin, feared contagion if Greece restructured its debt in 2010 \u2013 forcing the Fund to rip up its own rule book and lend to Greece, even though it knew it was highly unlikely it would ever get the money back.<br></p> <p>The conference would be presaged by an October 10 Summit meeting of officials from the IMF, World Bank and ECB and EU, Ethnos reported. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-53912967-8375-4234-be23-5130eac9a56f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/5/1409926783608/2b2369e9-a156-4e1e-8538-5f6413de5cf1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Supermoon over the Acropolis in Athens, Greece.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supermoon over the Acropolis in Athens, Greece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Our own efforts to get confirmation of the meeting from Fund officials sadly fell on stony ground today.</strong><br></p> <p> \u201cIn the American capital, where the IMF is based, all issues pertaining to the Greek programme are kept very low-key,\u201d Ethnos wrote. \u201cBut, according to [our] information, an open discussion is expected to take place in which the representatives of the lenders will each put forward their own proposals.</p> <p>\u201c[They] will attempt to come to some agreement about the debt \u2026 \u201cand to see how they can proceed from there on,\u201d it said. </p> <p>The Greek government had hoped that the thorny issue would be addressed when Greece resumed talks with Troika officials in Paris this week.

However, we\u2019re not too concerned by what is probably just an isolated blip.</p> <p>Other indicators suggest that labour market conditions are still strengthening and the latest round of survey evidence indicates that economic activity is soaring. Accordingly, this doesn\u2019t change our view that the Fed will begin to raise rates in March next year, a little earlier than many others expect, particularly not when the unemployment rate edged down to 6.1% last month, from 6.2%.</p> <p>Admittedly, the unemployment rate only fell because the labour force shrank by 64,000. The alternative household survey measure suggests that employment increased by only 16,000 last month. Nevertheless, that still leaves the unemployment rate within touching distance of the 5.5% level that most economists would view as the long-run equilibrium rate.</p> <p>The fact that average weekly hours worked were unchanged at 34.5 in August is another reason to believe that the slowdown in employment growth is nothing to worry about. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.2% m/m , but the annual growth rate was only 2.1%, adding some support to the Fed\u2019s view that it can still wait for a considerable time before beginning to raise rates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5409b197e4b04b37c94de65a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-05T12:56:00.965Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kitjuckes/statuses/507870835898867712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>US employment growth slowed from 1.86% y/y to 1.82%.

Rather like the ABS scheme, in fact.<br></p> <p>As the ECB president put it: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the first thing, the definition of QE is not really related to its size, but rather to its modalities. So QE is an outright purchase of assets. To give an example: rather than accepting these assets as collateral for lending, the ECB would outright purchase these assets. That\u2019s QE. It would inject money into the system. Now, QE can be private sector asset-based, or also sovereign-sector, public sector asset-based, or both. The components of today\u2019s measures are predominantly oriented to credit easing. </p> <p>However, it\u2019s quite clear that we would buy outright ABS, the senior tranches, and the mezzanine tranches only if there is a guarantee. In other words, very much like what the Fed did a few years ago. So there is also this component.</p> </blockquote> <p>Almost half of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest QE programme has been used to buy mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), which will be a major factor in the ECB\u2019s ABS programme. <em>So what\u2019s the difference?</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/izakaminska/statuses/507801105112526848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Befuddling this morning: all the notes saying Draghi didn&#39;t do QE.

      "bodyText": "Over to Dominic Rushe, our Wall Street correspondent, for his take on the non-farm payroll: US adds just 142,000 jobs in August to end streak of bigger gains The US added 142,000 jobs in August, the Labour Department announced on Friday, the lowest figure this year and one that ends a streak of months in which the economy added over 200,000 new positions. The news came as a surprise. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a gain of about 225,000. They correctly anticipated that the unemployment rate would fall to 6.1%, down from 6.2% and close to a six-year low. The US had added an average of 212,000 jobs each month over the prior 12 months. August\u2019s growth also did little to impact those worst hit by the recession. The unemployment rate for African Americans remained unchanged at 11.4%, more than twice the rate for white people, and Hispanic unemployment stayed flat at 7.5%. Teenage unemployment remained at 19.6%. The labour-force participation rate \u2014 which measures the percentage of the US population who are either working or looking for work \u2014 fell to 62.8% in August from July\u2019s 62.9%. The August rate matches the lowest level since the late 1970s and suggests many people may have given up looking for work.... Click here for the full story The downbeat non-farm payroll has put something of a dampener on the stock markets. In London, the FTSE 100 is down 28 point, or 0.4%, in late trading, and the Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.1%. Alastair McCaig, IG market analyst, says NFP cast a shadow over prospects for the next week despite further news of a possible ceasefire in Ukraine. Markets also suffered a hangover after surging yesterday as the ECB announced fresh stimulus measures: The post-ECB slump was intensified by the 142K print on non-farms, taking the shine off the US economic recovery. Jason Durman, the chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, has defended the US government\u2019s track record on employment. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Durman said that today\u2019s data \u201cextends the longest private sector job creation run in history\u201d, with 10 million new jobs added so far. He adds: There\u2019s more we need to do, there\u2019s more the President wants to do, but let\u2019s not get too excited or unexcited over any particular month. And Durman also conceded that inequality of wages is the biggest challenge facing America (and Europe, for that matter), and has been a problem for decades. He added: I absolutely agree it\u2019s our biggest economic challenge. He\u2019s also blogged about the data here: Back to the US jobs data. Economics blogger James Pethokoukis says today\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll is not encouraging. Certainly [it is] not one that suggests a shift into a higher growth gear. The Two Percent-ish economy crawls on. He is also concerned by the weak wage growth: Pethokoukis says: The anemic economy is generating jobs at the top and bottom, not so much in the middle. \u201cAverage is over\u201d as economist Tyler Cowen has put it And data yesterday from the Federal Reserve show that while income rose by 10% for the most affluent 10% of American families in 2010 through 2013, incomes were flat or falling for everybody else. Over in Greece, reports have begun to emerge that the International Monetary Fund will soon hold an emergency conference in Washington to deal exclusively with the country\u2019s debt problem. We haven\u2019t, yet, been able to get a response from the IMF. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: The IMF has decided, once and for all, to deal with the ever-vexing question of debt relief for Greece. Or, so says Michael Ignatiou, the normally well-informed Washington based IMF watcher for Greek daily Ethnos. The paper, citing \u201ca source well briefed on the issue,\u201d says the debt problem \u2013 only worsening by the day \u2013 will be addressed by the organization in a conference dedicated solely to the Greek economy in mid-November. Ignatiou wrote: \u201cAccording to the source, the conference is being described as extremely important.\u201d \u201cAt the high-level November meeting all the issues that concern Greece will be discussed but it is expected that lenders will focus on the debt issue, which as all know is not sustainable.\u201d At the onset of the Eurozone crisis, Greece\u2019s debt load amounted to just under 130% of GDP. By the end of the year, after four years of EU-IMF mandated austerity, which has seen the Greek economy contract by more than 25 percent, it is expected to hit 175% of national output. The IMF has longed pressed for the country\u2019s debt problem to be resolved with Funds officials saying, openly, that a debt restructuring should have taken place earlier. In the two years from the onset of the debt crisis, when Athens received its first EU-IMF backed bailout, to the write-down that took place in 2012 (by far the biggest in global financial history) both the euro zone and Greece saw their economies go from bad to worse. European officials, not least in Berlin, feared contagion if Greece restructured its debt in 2010 \u2013 forcing the Fund to rip up its own rule book and lend to Greece, even though it knew it was highly unlikely it would ever get the money back. The conference would be presaged by an October 10 Summit meeting of officials from the IMF, World Bank and ECB and EU, Ethnos reported. Our own efforts to get confirmation of the meeting from Fund officials sadly fell on stony ground today. \u201cIn the American capital, where the IMF is based, all issues pertaining to the Greek programme are kept very low-key,\u201d Ethnos wrote. \u201cBut, according to [our] information, an open discussion is expected to take place in which the representatives of the lenders will each put forward their own proposals. \u201c[They] will attempt to come to some agreement about the debt \u2026 \u201cand to see how they can proceed from there on,\u201d it said. The Greek government had hoped that the thorny issue would be addressed when Greece resumed talks with Troika officials in Paris this week. Instead, creditors ensured the issue was kept off the agenda, focusing instead on Athens\u2019 performance in implementing structural reforms. The US non-farm payroll report is notoriously volatile - indeed, it\u2019s reckoned to be accurate to only +/- 100,000 people. Chris Williamson of data firm Markit reckons we should focus more on the \u201creasonably robust\u201d underlying hiring trend. But there\u2019s no escaping the lack of strong wage growth: \u201cMost importantly, however, the missing element of the recovery remains wages growth, the absence of which means policy makers will be in no hurry to cool the pace of economic growth via higher interest rates. Average employee earnings rose just 2.1% on a year ago, a rate that has held fairly steady in recent years despite the economic recovery.\u201d The breakdown of the jobs report shows that manufacturers didn\u2019t hire any extra workers, construction hiring rose by 20,000, while the sector service took on 122,000 additional staff. The top line in today\u2019s jobs report are that fewer Americans found work last month, more simply dropped out of the labour market altogether, and wages barely managed to match inflation. Tanweer Akram of Voya Investment Management sums up the other key points: Inflationary pressures from wages remain subdued. Average hourly earnings rose just 2.1% in the past 12 months, whereas CPI-U increased 2.0% between July 2013 and July 2014. PCE inflation is still undershooting the Fed\u2019s target. The U.S. economy has continued to add jobs at a decent pace in recent quarters. Nevertheless there is still slack in the labor market due to the weakness of effective demand. Both demographic factors and the weakness of effective demand have led to low rates of labor force participation. Despite the slower pace of job growth in August, the Fed is expected to end its large-scale asset purchase program in Oct 2014. Monetary policy will remain accommodative this year and the next. The Fed will be cautious in raising the fed funds target rate. It may began to do sometime in the middle of next year contingent on continuation of economic recovery. But it will do so in a restrained manner. Some economists seem to be prepared to chuck this month\u2019s disappointing jobs report in the trash. Rob Carnell of ING says the headline jobs number simply doesn\u2019t square with other surveys: Non-farm payrolls has disappointed badly, with a rise of only 142K, no rise in employment in the manufacturing sector, and a fall in retail employment. The headline figure is weak compared to the ADP survey, and both of the ISM surveys, and also many of the regional surveys. As such, we are hard pressed to give it much credence. More believably, the unemployment rate did fall by 0.1pp to 6.1% and hourly wages, which were revised upwards, rose 0.2%mom to stand at 2.1%YoY. Not helping matters, the household survey showed a rise in employment in August of only 16K. Such weakness plays into the hands of the Fed doves, of whom, Chair Janet Yellen is the most important, and gives her more leeway to stand firm against the hawks, many of whom are calling for a change in the Fed\u2019s language on the likely timing and scale of policy normalisation. Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics takes a similar line: And Ashraf Laidi, Chief Global Strategist of Cityindex.co.uk, reckons the report won\u2019t make the Fed change course: Since average hourly earnings continued to rise, the report overcomes the notion of weak wage growth and maintains the Federal Reserve on course to taper its asset purchases at this month\u2019s FOMC meeting, with the plan to end QE3 next month. #sarcasm The drop in August\u2019s non-farm payroll may just be a one-off event, reckons Capital Economics. Their chief US economist, Paul Ashworth, also suggests that wages aren\u2019t rising fast enough to spook the Fed: The modest 142,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in August, which was well below the consensus forecast at 230,000 and the smallest gain this year, will inevitably spark speculation that the US recovery is somehow coming off the rails again. However, we\u2019re not too concerned by what is probably just an isolated blip. Other indicators suggest that labour market conditions are still strengthening and the latest round of survey evidence indicates that economic activity is soaring. Accordingly, this doesn\u2019t change our view that the Fed will begin to raise rates in March next year, a little earlier than many others expect, particularly not when the unemployment rate edged down to 6.1% last month, from 6.2%. Admittedly, the unemployment rate only fell because the labour force shrank by 64,000. The alternative household survey measure suggests that employment increased by only 16,000 last month. Nevertheless, that still leaves the unemployment rate within touching distance of the 5.5% level that most economists would view as the long-run equilibrium rate. The fact that average weekly hours worked were unchanged at 34.5 in August is another reason to believe that the slowdown in employment growth is nothing to worry about. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.2% m/m , but the annual growth rate was only 2.1%, adding some support to the Fed\u2019s view that it can still wait for a considerable time before beginning to raise rates. The US dollar has fallen against major currencies. That suggests analysts are concluding that today\u2019s disappointing Non-Farm Payroll makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon. The euro has gained 0.15%, undoing a little bit of yesterday\u2019s tumble, to $1.297. The pound has also pulled back from a seven-month low, to $1.6305. Hat-tip to Marketwatch for this graph showing how job creation slowed last month: Another downbeat stat in the US jobs report - the labor force participation rate fell last month, to 62.8%, from 62.9% in July. That means that more people dropped out of the workforce last month, and explains why the unemployment rate fell to 6.1%. Seth Harris, a former deputy US labor Secretary, is disappointed that wages didn\u2019t rise more last month. He tweets that wages are rising too slowly, and not beating inflation: The non-farm payroll report shows that average earnings rose by 0.2% in August, up from 0.1% in July. On an annual basis, pay packets were 2.1% larger than in August 2013. The instant reaction is that it\u2019s a somewhat disappointing jobs report: Previous US jobs reports have also been revised. July\u2019s non-farm payroll has been revised up by 3,000, to 212k. But June\u2019s figure has been cut by 31,000, from 298,000 to 267,000. Breaking: The non-farm payroll has been released, and the headline news is that much fewer jobs were created last month than expected. The non-farm payroll expanded by just 142,000 last month, compared to expectations of around 230,000. That\u2019s the lowest number of new jobs created in eight months. The jobless rate has dropped, to 6.1% from 6.2% in July. Reuters\u2019 survey of economists also found they expect around 225,000 new jobs were created in the US in August: The Non-Farm Payroll always generates lots of forecasts on social media, with people trying to predict how many new jobs were created last month (excluding the volatile agricultural sector). Bloomberg has been tracking the various guesses informed suggestions, and reports that the consensus is just over 229,000. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, reckons today\u2019s non-farm payroll could show the US labour market is stronger than economists realise: US economic news-flow has dramatically outperformed relative to consensus forecasts over recent weeks, suggesting analysts are underestimating the vigor of the world\u2019s largest economy and opening the door for an upside surprise. OK, just over 35 minutes until the US jobs data for August hits the wires. It\u2019s guaranteed to trigger at least a brief period of excitement in the financial markets, but more importantly it should give clues as to whether the American labour market improving... ...with knock-on impact for the Federal Reserve as it assesses whether to raise interest rates. Economists will be looking at how many more people found work, whether more people entered the labour market, and whether wages picked up. Wall Street expects: Around 230,000 new jobs were created in August, up from 209,000 last time A drop in the jobless rate, to 6.1% from 6.2% No change in the average weekly hours worked, at 34.5 Average hourly earnings could rise to 2.1% annually, from 2.0% last month. The dash into eurozone government bonds just drove the yield on 10-year Irish and Italian debt down to record lows, according to Tradeweb data: ITALIAN 10-YEAR GOVT BOND YIELDS HIT RECORD LOW OF 2.279 PCT - TRADEWEB IRISH 10-YEAR GOVT BOND YIELDS FALL TO ALL-TIME LOW OF 1.707 PCT - TRADEWEB Less than three years ago, Italian 10-year bond yields has smashed through the 7% mark, raising fears that it would lose the ability to borrow affordably. Economist Shaun Richards has also blogged on the quantitative-easing aspects of the ECB\u2019s plan to buy asset-backed securities and covered bonds (which have a revenue flow from underlying assets such as mortgages): Yes these two operations will be a type of QE in the way that purchases of Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) by the US Federal Reserve have been. Along the way there was a hint from Mario Draghi that the ECB would take its balance sheet back to its peak size. As this would involve around a trillion Euros of expansion he may have to introduce other measures too. Shaun also points out the dangers in buying ABSs \u2013 the assets may prove to be toxic, as we learned through the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Let me remind you of a phrase the Bank of England invented when it was involved in such a policy, \u201cphantom securities\u201d, where it did not get what it thought it was getting in a repetition of the AAA-rated scandal which got us into this mess. A version of that will replace the \u201cclear and transparent\u201d rhetoric we are currently seeing, but no-one seems much bothered by that. Indeed ECB policy seems to be exactly the reverse as it asks for a market to be created. Further down the line Euro area taxpayers have legitimate concerns that \u201csurprise\u201d losses may mount as AAA turns one more time to actually be ZZZ. My colleague Katie Allen has been pondering the question of whether the European Central Bank\u2019s ABS scheme is simply quantitative easing by any other name. She says: When Draghi was asked the question at the press conference yesterday he appeared to dodge it (see quote at 9.59am), leaving economists in the market to try and figure it out for themselves. It\u2019s worth bearing in mind a few things here. The academic definition of QE is the monetary financing of a government deficit. In other words, a central bank prints money and the government spends it, to build roads, for example. In common parlance at the moment, QE refers to the purchase of government bonds by the central bank. In other words, indirectly the central is giving the government money so they can go out and build roads. To do this, the central bank simply makes up money out of thin air \u2013 what people call pumping electronic money into the financial system \u2013 and that means the central bank\u2019s balance sheet showing what it holds and owes has got bigger. Draghi\u2019s definition from the press conference yesterday is that QE is the purchase of assets which results in the expansion of a central bank\u2019s balance sheet. What the ECB is doing on asset-backed securities is expanding the ECB\u2019s balance sheet. So perhaps the ECB chief did answer the question after all. Or as John Aziz of The Week put it yesterday: (reminder, the full transcript is online here) The pound is heading for its worst week in a year, as Scottish independence jitters hit sterling. It\u2019s down again today, dropping 0.2 of a cent to $1.6313. That means it\u2019s shed 1.7% this week, a big shift in FX terms. And the cost of hedging against the pound being volatile over the next month continues to rise, on what is being dubbed the \u201cScotchexit risks\u201d. The eurozone\u2019s failure to grow between April and June is disappointing and worrying, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Already lacklustre Eurozone economic activity seemingly suffered in the second quarter as heightened global geopolitical tensions (particularly the Ukraine/Russia crisis) weighed down on investment. It also illustrates why the ECB took action last week (although there was dissent on the governing council). We have confirmation that the eurozone failed to grow last quarter, and companies\u2019 failure to invest was a key factor. Eurostat has reported that GDP was flat at 0.0% in April-June, in line with the initial estimate. Today\u2019s report shows that \u201cgross fixed capital formation\u201d (investment) fell by 0.3% across the euro area, while household consumption rose by 0.3%. Trade made a positive contribution to eurozone GDP - exports rose by 0.5%, while imports rose 0.3%. But falling inventories dragged back growth -- as companies ate into their stocks. The fastest growing countries were: Malta (+1.3%), Latvia (+1.0%), Lithuania, Hungary and the United Kingdom (all +0.8%) recorded the highest growth compared with the previous quarter. The worst performers were: Romania (-1.0%), Denmark and Cyprus (both -0.3%), Germany and Italy (both -0.2%). Back in the UK, nearly half the population expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates within the next year. The latest survey of inflation expectations show the 49% of the public see a rate rise in the next 12 months, up from 42% in May. That\u2019s a three year high. Inflation expectations are also up. People expect the consumer prices index will be 2.8% in a year\u2019s time, up from 2.5% in May. Looking further ahead, medium-term inflation expectations have risen significantly -- to 3.4%, from 2.9% in May. There\u2019s a lot of debate this morning as to whether the ECB\u2019s asset-backed securities programme should really be classed as a form of quantitative easing. Arguably it should. The initial reaction in many quarters was that it\u2019s not QE; as the ECB is buying securities based on private loans, not sovereign debt issued by governments. Mario Draghi did indicate that the governing council was committed to using \u201cadditional unconventional instruments within its mandate\u201d, suggesting that \u201cfull-blown\u201d QE (as the FT puts it) is still on hand. But the transcript of the press conference shows that he defines QE as an outright purchase of assets to expand the money supply. Rather like the ABS scheme, in fact. As the ECB president put it: On the first thing, the definition of QE is not really related to its size, but rather to its modalities. So QE is an outright purchase of assets. To give an example: rather than accepting these assets as collateral for lending, the ECB would outright purchase these assets. That\u2019s QE. It would inject money into the system. Now, QE can be private sector asset-based, or also sovereign-sector, public sector asset-based, or both. The components of today\u2019s measures are predominantly oriented to credit easing. However, it\u2019s quite clear that we would buy outright ABS, the senior tranches, and the mezzanine tranches only if there is a guarantee. In other words, very much like what the Fed did a few years ago. So there is also this component. Almost half of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest QE programme has been used to buy mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), which will be a major factor in the ECB\u2019s ABS programme. So what\u2019s the difference? Maybe it\u2019s our fault for getting too fixed on QE as a magic cure. Sir Mervyn King, the former Bank of England governor, didn\u2019t even like using the term QE when discussing the \u00a3375bn of UK government bonds his bank had mopped up. He stuck to discussing the \u201casset purchase programme\u201d, while the Fed always talks about an \u201casset purchase program\u201d Incidentally, Japan\u2019s Nomura bank reckons there\u2019s a decent chance of \u2018full QE\u2019 next year. Investors are piling into eurozone government bonds this morning. The rally has driven the yield, or interest rates, on Irish two-year bonds was into negative territory, according to Bloomberg data. That means investors effectively paying a small premium to hold short-term Irish debt. Bond yields fall when prices rise, so the recent surge of money into the bond market has pushed those yields to record lows. And as this chart shows, there are now 10 European countries whose two-year bond yields are negative. The asset-backed security programme announced by the ECB yesterday could be the prelude to a large-scale purchase of government bonds, suspects Jeremy Cook of World First. He explains: From the October meeting, the European Central Bank will begin purchasing assets from the private sector in a bid to loosen credit markets within the Eurozone. This additional measure is the beginning step to a larger plan for the full-scale purchase of European government debt, we believe. There are significant challenges to getting to this destination of course; drastic legal changes are required and we know that the German Central Bank was unhappy with the vote on ABS. There is little chance of getting the Germans onside for full-scale quantitative easing without a significant deterioration in the continent\u2019s economic outlook. A quiet start in the financial markets, with the German DAX and UK FTSE 100 both down around 0.15% in early trading, and the French CAC flat. BP shares are under pressure in London, down another 0.5%. Yesterday they tumbled almost 6%, after a US court ruled the firm was reckless and negligent over Deepwater Horizon disaster. Another sign that Germany\u2019s economy may be recovering after suffering a contraction in the second quarter of this year. Industrial production in the eurozone\u2019s traditional powerhouse surged by 1.9% month-on-month in July, smashing forecasts for a 0.3% rise. It\u2019s the biggest jump in 28 months, and was driven by production of capital goods (heavy-duty machinery). The German economy ministry is cautiously optimistic, saying the rise strengthens the \u2018positive trend\u2019, subject to geopolitical developments. And the rise is may also be due to people taking holidays in August. The ECB\u2019s stimulus measures are likely to weaken the euro further, reckons Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. He predicts: If the US recovery continues enough to allow the Fed to hike rates in line with its famous dots, we will see Eur/USD well below 1.20 in a couple of years. Kit also reckons that today\u2019s non-farm payroll will show another drop in the US unemployment, to 6.1%. Pay growth is also important: I am watching wages to see if in a world where the annual pay increase is dead, pay growth is driven by whether we pay more for new entrants. This year\u2019s crop of American graduate trainees and new teachers - I\u2019m looking at you. Something else to watch out for today; Moody\u2019s will be releasing a new report on Portugal\u2019s credit rating: Economist Nouriel Roubini reckons that the ECB\u2019s asset-backed securities programme (acquiring pools of loans from the banks) is \u2018effectively\u2019 quantitative easing. Yesterday, Mario Draghi insisted that ABS wasn\u2019t QE, although we don\u2019t get full details of the ABS plan until October. As Caroline Hyde pointed out on Bloomberg this morning, there are still plenty of questions to answer. One issue is that banks actually want to hold high-quality ABSs, so might be reluctant to sell. That could mean the ECB mops up \u2018mezzanine\u2019 (effectively riskier) pools of loans as well, she suggested. Update: Draghi explained yesterday that the ECB would only buy these \u2018mezzanine\u2019 tranches if they came with a guarantee Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial market, the world economy, the eurozone and business. After yesterday\u2019s excitement from the European Central Bank, the financial markets are looking to America today. It\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll Friday, when the latest US unemployment data shows how many more people joined the jobs market. And crucially, the NFP will also indicate whether wages are picking up in America; an important factor for the Federal Reserve when deciding when to start raising interest rates. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons it will: \u201creinforce the narrative of an improving US economy, and bring forward the prospect of a Fed rate hike in 2015.\u201d Economists expect that around 230,000 new jobs were created in America in August, up from 209k in July. That would push the unemployment rate down to 6.1%, from 6.2% last month. Average earnings are expected to edge higher to 2.1%. Hewson adds: A number higher than 2% could well prompt additional speculation about an earlier rise in rates. In Europe, though, there\u2019s a sense that people are catching their breath and trying to work out the implications of the ECB\u2019s latest stimulus moves. Can a new programme to buy asset-backed securities, and the latest (and final) interest rate cuts steer Europe away from deflation and weak growth? Or is it just another spin of the roulette wheel by Super Mario Draghi? In the meantime, the eurozone is hovering around $1.294, having tumbled two whole cents against the US dollar yesterday. New eurozone growth data is due this morning, which will remind us just how weak it was last spring. The first estimate of GDP in Q2, released last month, showed no growth in the euro area. That\u2019s unlikely to change, but we will get more details about household spending, government expenditure, etc. So here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30am: Bank of England/GfK survey of inflation expectations 10am: Second estimate of Eurozone GDP for the second quarter of 2014 1.30pm: US non-farm payroll for August I\u2019ll be tracking all the main points through the day.....",

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank surprised markets on Thursday with fresh measures to boost a flagging eurozone economy threatened with deflation and the risks of an escalating conflict in Ukraine. Policymakers cut the already ultra-low main interest rate from 0.15% to 0.05%. They also made it more expensive for banks to park money with the ECB \u2013 cutting the deposit rate, which was already negative, from -0.1% to -0.2% in the hope of persuading banks to lend more to businesses and consumers. The action took investors by surprise and drove the euro down more than two cents against the dollar to a 14-month low of $1.29. A weaker currency helps the eurozone's exporters. In London the Bank of England held rates at a record low of 0.5% for the 66th monthly meeting in a row. European stock markets rose following the decisive action from the ECB president, Mario Draghi, and his colleagues on the governing council. The FTSEurofirst 300 index, which tracks the biggest companies across the region, rose 1.2% to its highest close since January 2008. \"The ECB stepped up to the plate as the eurozone recovery is grinding almost to a halt,\" said Christian Schulz, a senior economist at the German bank Berenberg. The central bank announced further measures to encourage lending by buying asset-backed securities. Full details will be published in October, Draghi said. The ECB stopped short of embarking on full-scale quantitative easing (QE) which would potentially involve the bank purchasing government debt. Draghi revealed the 24-strong governing council was split over the package of new measures, but said a \"comfortable majority\" was in favour. It is thought that Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany's Bundesbank, was opposed. Speaking at a press conference following the decision, he said the eurozone's member states were also divided over QE. \"QE was discussed. Some members of the governing council were in favour of doing more, and some members were in favour of doing less. So our proposals strike the mid road.\" Draghi said interest rates would not be cut further. Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, said: \"With another rate cut, an ABS purchasing programme and a new covered bond purchasing programme, the ECB has now reached a point at which fully fledged QE, ie outright purchases of government bonds, is the only option left.\" The ECB nudged down its forecast for eurozone growth this year to 0.9%, from an earlier forecast of 1%. It also revised down its growth forecasts for 2015 to 1.6%, from 1.7%, but it revised up its forecast for 2016 to 1.9%, from 1.8%. It lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 0.6% from a previous forecast of 0.7%, but Draghi said policymakers did not expect outright deflation, despite a current inflation rate of just 0.3%. The ECB left its inflation forecast for 2015 and 2016 unchanged at 1.1% and 1.6% respectively. There was zero growth in the eurozone economy in the second quarter, following 0.2% growth in the first quarter. Fears are mounting that rising tensions between the west and Russia, fuelled by the alleged presence of Russian troops in Ukraine, will derail the weak recovery.",

In the more erratic seasonally adjusted terms, real GDP grew 3.1%, down from 3.3% in the March quarter but still looking quite good.</p> <p>And yet quarterly growth of GDP has been slowing this year.

The annual growth is a mere 4%, which is well below the 25-year average of 6.1%.</p> <p>This is a concern given the link between nominal GDP growth and taxation revenue.

But it does highlight that an export boom is not guaranteed to be as steady and strong as the investment boom, especially when export prices are falling.</p> <p>The Bureau of Statistics noted the terms of trade (the prices for our exports compared with our imports) fell for the 12th straight quarter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/swJj9/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>They are now 20% below where they were three years ago \u2013 marking the biggest three-year drop ever, surpassing the 17% fall that occurred in the mid-1970s when the Opec oil crises jacked up the price of oil.</p> <h2><strong>3.
