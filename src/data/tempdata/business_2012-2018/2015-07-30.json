      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund will refuse to participate in a new bailout for Greece until there is an \u201cexplicit and concrete agreement\u201d on debt relief from the country\u2019s eurozone creditors, an IMF official has confirmed. Without the IMF\u2019s involvement, Greece\u2019s eurozone partners will have to find more funds to meet Athens\u2019 short-term financing needs, raising questions about whether the outline \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn) bailout thrashed out earlier this month will prove workable. As the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, battled to win the backing of his radical Syriza party for the austerity programme demanded by the rest of the eurozone, an IMF official, speaking from Washington, said the fund would not get involved until there is \u201can explicit and concrete agreement between Greece and its eurozone partners on how to provide debt relief\u201d. The IMF insisted that it also expects tough economic reforms from Athens in return for a reduction in its debt burden. \u201cThere is a need for difficult decisions on both sides. One should not be under the illusion that just one side can fix the problem,\u201d the official said. Meanwhile, the IMF\u2019s team in Athens, which is helping draw up a third bailout, would not \u201csit on the sidelines\u201d, the official said. But it will not sign up to any formal support programme for the troubled country. \u201cWe will be participating actively in policy discussions over the coming weeks.\u201d On Wednesday, Christine Lagarde told the IMF\u2019s board, made up of representatives of its member countries, that an IMF team should be sent to Greece. But the official said: \u201cThe board would not support a scheme that did not meet medium-term sustainability.\u201d Greece\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio has shot up to 175%, from the 120% level when it first received a bailout from the \u201ctroika\u201d of the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European commission in 2010. News of the IMF board\u2019s tough line emerged as Tsipras challenged members of Syriza to back the decision to sign up for fresh spending cuts and reforms demanded by the country\u2019s creditors. At a meeting of Syriza\u2019s national council in Athens on Thursday, Tsipras offered party members two options: an internal \u201creferendum\u201d this Sunday, to consider the terms of the deal hammered out earlier this month; or an extraordinary party meeting in September. By a show of hands the meeting opted for the latter. Tsipras managed to pass the latest austerity measures with the backing of opposition MPs, allowing talks on a new bailout to begin. But he is yet to win the support of many in his own party. Speaking at the Syriza gathering in a former cinema, Tsipras reiterated the fact that caving in to the country\u2019s creditors was \u201cnot of our choice\u201d, but the only alternative was to leave the eurozone. The details of the third bailout are yet to be finalised but the IMF appears to be challenging Greece\u2019s other creditors, led by Germany, to soften their opposition to substantive debt relief. The tough deal hammered out by eurozone leaders earlier this month held out the promise of debt restructuring if Athens passes new economic reforms, but provided no details. The IMF\u2019s own debt sustainability analysis, published in the aftermath of the negotiations between Tsipras and his eurozone partners earlier this month, suggests that the country\u2019s debt burden will quickly become unmanageable without a lengthy moratorium on repayments, perhaps of up to 30 years, or a reduction in the face value of the debt. The IMF official said the fund stood by that analysis. With talks only just getting under way in Athens - and particularly given the IMF\u2019s decision to avoid getting involved immediately - analysts say it is increasingly unlikely that a deal can be done in time for 20 August. This is when Greece is due to make a \u20ac3.4bn repayment to the European Central Bank. Observers have been expecting Greece to seek a short-term bridging loan from its eurozone partners to cover the ECB payment. But without IMF involvement, the amount of funding needed in the coming months is likely to be considerably higher. The IMF\u2019s role in the eurozone bailouts has been controversial since the first rescue of Greece in 2010. However, the European commission and the ECBfelt the credibility of the bailouts was boosted by the presence of the IMF, due to the tough conditions the fund attaches to financial aid. Asked whether it had been a mistake to get involved in the first place, the IMF official said: \u201cWe learn as we go along, in evolving circumstances, and the experience that we have will be embedded in any new discussions that we have. This is, of course, one of the reasons why we say this requires difficult discussions on both sides.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s overlap of private and political activities was once again in the spotlight on Thursday after a Wall Street Journal report that since Clinton helped broker a settlement in a legal tax case against UBS while she was secretary of state, the Swiss bank has increased its financial support and involvement in Clinton Foundation projects. In February 2009, the IRS sued UBS and demanded that it disclose the names of 52,000 possible American tax evaders with secret Swiss bank accounts. In the months that followed \u2013 thanks to involvement of Clinton as secretary of state and Swiss lawmakers \u2013 a legal settlement was negotiated. On 19 August 2009, it was announced that UBS would pay no fine and would provide the IRS with information about 4,450 accounts within a year. Since the deal was struck, disclosures by the foundation and the bank show the donations by UBS to the Clinton Foundation growing \u201cfrom less than $60,000 through 2008 to a cumulative total of about $600,000 by the end of 2014\u201d, according to the Wall Street Journal. The bank also teamed up with the foundation on the Clinton Economic Opportunity Initiative, creating a pilot entrepreneur program through which UBS offered $32m in loans to businesses, the newspaper reported. Other UBS donations to the Clinton Foundation include a $350,000 donation from June 2011 and a $100,000 donation for a charity golf tournament. Additionally, UBS paid more than $1.5m in speaking fees to Bill Clinton between 2001 and 2014, the newspaper reported. A UBS spokeswoman told the Journal that any insinuation of a connection between the legal case and the Clinton Foundation \u201cis ludicrous and without merit\u201d. \u201cAny suggestions that [Clinton] was driven by anything but what\u2019s in America\u2019s best interest would be false. Period,\u201d said a Clinton campaign spokesman. He referred UBS-related questions to the State Department, which told the Journal that the bank was a topic of \u201cserious discussion, among other issues\u201d in bilateral talks with the Swiss. Clinton\u2019s involvement in the UBS settlement is no secret. A Reuters analysis of the settlement negotiations published in April 2010 showed that Clinton was involved at several points in the process. According to the report, the US State Department was grateful to the Swiss for their support in places like Cuba and Iran and for \u201chelping to broker a deal that normalized relations between Turkey and Armenia\u201d. As such, then-Swiss foreign minister Micheline Calmy-Rey was able to connect with Clinton over the phone and meet her face to face three times before the deal was struck in August. The Wall Street Journal claims that Clinton\u2019s involvement was \u201cmore extensive than previously reported\u201d. Using cables published by WikiLeaks and interviewing people involved, the Journal reported that prior to the deal being struck, the Swiss assisted in a release of a US journalist jailed in Iran, told the US that Swiss-based energy-consulting company Colenco would shut down its Iran operations and expressed willingness to accept some low-risk Guant\u00e1namo detainees.",

      "bodyText": "The UK financial services industry could be facing a \u00a333bn compensation bill for failing to disclose commission payments to customers, according to estimates by analysts. The tally would be greater than the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal for which the industry has already shelled out more than \u00a320bn and which is expected to rise further on Friday when Lloyds Banking Group is expected to top up its provision by \u00a31bn. The \u00a333bn estimate was made by researchers at brokers Autonomous Research, according to a Reuters report, following a court ruling in November relating to commission paid for the sale of PPI. The case was brought by Susan Plevin over the commission on a loan to which PPI was attached. In the case, which is known as Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance, the supreme court ruled that if a PPI seller failed to disclose to a customer that it had received a large commission from the product provider, the sale was unfair under the 1974 Consumer Credit Act. Plevin, a widowed college lecturer, borrowed \u00a334,000 from Paragon Personal Finance through the broker. While she was told commission was paid she did not know how much. More than 70% of the \u00a35,780 premium was commission. The Financial Conduct Authority said in May that it was looking at the implications of this case and in June HSBC became the first major bank to mention the case in its legal disclosures. Other banks have since followed. The Autonomous analysis is based on a Plevin decision being applied to other products such as store cards and car loans, according to Reuters. \u201cIn essence this ruling appears to open up a new angle for PPI mis-selling claims, based on commission payment (as opposed to the PPI policy),\u201d Autonomous analysts said, according to a copy of the research seen by Reuters.",

In the case, which is known as <a href=\"http://ukscblog.com/new-judgment-plevin-respondent-v-paragon-personal-finance-limited-appellant-2014-uksc-61/\">Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance</a>, the supreme court ruled that if a PPI seller failed to disclose to a customer that it had received a large commission from the product provider, the sale was unfair under the 1974 Consumer Credit Act. </p> <p>Plevin, a widowed college lecturer, borrowed \u00a334,000 from Paragon Personal Finance through the broker.

      "bodyText": "Under its last chief executive, Centrica told its shareholders for half a decade that it was absolutely essential that the company should explore for, and produce, more oil and gas while simultaneously generating more of its own energy. Over-reliance on one end of the energy market \u2013 the retail business, meaning British Gas \u2013 was deemed dangerous. Centrica needed a spread of investments. Integrated Energy \u2013 the title of the annual report as late as 2012 \u2013 was the philosophy. Centrica\u2019s new boss, Iain Conn, like his predecessor Sam Laidlaw, comes from the world of Big Oil but he can see, as everybody can, the flaw in the old approach. Centrica, in spending the thick end of \u00a310bn on oil and gas assets, made a bad bet and acquired a habit it can no longer afford. Most of those fields were bought in the days of $100 oil and returns are miserable at $55. Profits from gas production plunged 90% to \u00a348m in the last half year. Meanwhile, the supposed balance from the supply end doesn\u2019t work like it used to. True, operating profits at British Gas rose 44% to \u00a3656m in the six months, but harder times lie around the corner. Prices for customers have been cut 10%, independent suppliers are pinching customers, and regulators and politicians are keener to jump on any sign of high margins. Add it all up, and Centrica\u2019s arithmetic has gone haywire. Peter Atherton, an analyst at Jefferies, has a striking statistic: in 2006, it took \u00a3280m of capital employed for Centrica to generate 1p per share of earnings; by 2013, the figure was \u00a3350m; then it was \u00a3500m in 2014 as oil and gas prices started to fall. Conn\u2019s strategic U-turn thus makes sense. Instead of producing 70m barrels of oil equivalent, output will be allowed to fall to between 40m and 50m. Some \u00a31.5bn of capital will be withdrawn from production and generation. Windfarms, and some production assets, will be sold to raise \u00a3500m to \u00a31bn. Centrica won\u2019t be a disintegrated energy company, just less integrated than it was. Throw in the cost savings from 6,000 job losses, plus the already announced 30% cut to dividend, and the arithmetic seems to work again. Remember, though, that Centrica is a company that seems to require reinvention every seven years or so. Laidlaw\u2019s integrated approach was a reaction against a previous diversification model that led Centrica up some strange avenues, such as buying the AA and launching a credit card called Goldfish. Conn, in pitching Centrica as an energy and services company, has landed somewhere in between \u2013 the services, thankfully, will all be energy-related. Perfectly sensible, but note: the company\u2019s past two strategies worked for a while, and then they didn\u2019t. Play the waiting game on RBS Roll up, roll up, who wants to buy shares in a bank that won\u2019t pay a dividend until 2017, and where the next big bill for past bad behaviour could be \u00a32bn but might be \u00a38bn? To be fair to Royal Bank of Scotland, that\u2019s not the whole story. There is firmer evidence (at last) that the core bank, as they call it, is responding to treatment. Ignoring all the restructuring charges and conduct costs, there was an underlying operating profit of \u00a31.8bn in the second quarter, up 11% on the first. Chief executive Ross McEwan deserves praise for his war on \u201cteaser\u201d rates on credit card transfers; the industry has turned the practice into an unedifying game of pass-the-parcel with the debts of over-extended borrowers. The BBC\u2019s fly-on-the-wall series, The Bank: a Matter of Life and Debt, filmed in NatWest\u2019s Huddersfield branch, may also help the rehabilitation of RBS\u2019s name. One marvels at the restraint of hard-pressed staff earning as little as \u00a316,000 a year \u2013 it\u2019s a wonder they didn\u2019t lynch the bosses of the Fred Goodwin era. But back to the financials. RBS trades at just 0.8 times its book value, reflecting uncertainties such as the size of the looming penalty from the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the US in 2005-07. Yet, on current form, the bank will surely get to book value eventually. Chancellor George Osborne is gung-ho to start selling the state\u2019s shares soon. Delay still looks wiser. Will Vlieghe keep living on the hedge? Gertjan Vlieghe, the new recruit to the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, sounds like an upstanding sort of chap. And, no doubt, Threadneedle Street will rigorously apply its code of conduct to prevent conflicts of interest. Even so, it will look very odd to the outside world that Vlieghe is allowed to keep a passive stake in his former employer, Brevan Howard, a hedge fund that likes to bet on interest rate moves. It would be better all round if Brevan could find a way to buy out Vlieghe\u2019s interest at fair value.",

Even so, the release of the first-half figures could help clear the way for the chancellor, George Osborne, to start selling off the taxpayer\u2019s 79% stake in the bank, a legacy of the institution\u2019s 2008 bailout. Trading in the shares was volatile after the figures were released: after jumping 4% at the open they closed 3% lower at 342p. Hampton said: \u201cPast experience at RBS and many other banks has demonstrated the readiness of regulators to impose substantial fines and costly redress schemes\u201d. Hampton, who became chairman in 2009, is being replaced by Sir Howard Davies in September. \u201cThe industry as a whole has got a poor track record in predicting these [provisions]. We\u2019ve consistently under-called them,\u201d said Hampton. RBS has taken \u00a310bn of provisions since the crisis. The most expensive hit still to come is over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold in the US before the 2008 crisis, although settlement talks are yet to begin. Hampton also pointed to unresolved allegations about the bank\u2019s treatment of struggling businesses in the UK. A report commissioned by the City regulator is to be completed later this year and if it concludes there was bad treatment, RBS warned it could face enforcement action and compensation payouts. These are the latest problems for RBS which in May, was on the list of banks shamed for rigging foreign exchange markets. The chief executive, Ross McEwan, warned the rest of the year would be \u201cnoisy\u201d as the long list of mistakes from the past continued to catch up with the bank. In the first half of 2015 the bank made \u00a3153m of losses compared with \u00a31.4bn a year ago. On an operating basis, last year\u2019s profits of \u00a32.6bn were the highest since the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, but have fallen back to \u00a3629m. Some \u00a31.5bn of restructuring costs, which include scaling back the investment bank which once dominated the business, also ate into profits. Hampton said he not appreciated how long it would take to fix the bank when he joined. But, he said, he was pleased Osborne had signalled a share sale could begin even though the shares are worth less than the average 502p the government paid for them. To facilitate a potential selloff by the government, the bank provided more information than usual about the potential penalties it faces, including detail of the scale of RMBS situation. There are three separate actions, including 25 lawsuits and an investigation by the Department of Justice in the US as well as a number of attorney generals across the US. The latest provisions include \u00a3334m for foreign exchange rigging, \u00a3506m for RMBS and \u00a3157m in relation to packaged accounts, or current accounts with insurance and other products attached to them. RBS has now set aside \u00a3300m for packaged accounts. Barclays also took a \u00a3250m provision in the first half for the same products. The ringfencing rules, which require banks to erect a barrier between their high street and investment banking arms, are likely to result in a higher profile for its NatWest brand, the bank said. The bank is required to spin off 316 branches under the Williams &amp; Glyn brand under terms agreed with the European Union at the time of its bailout. Hampton said: \u201cThis was part of the fog of war of the bailouts.\u201d The EU thought it would take a matter of months for this to happen, said Hampton, rather than the years the task has consumed because of the complexity.",

      "bodyText": "Good-bye, and thank you for all your great comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Before I go.... The Financial Times is reporting that the IMF\u2019s executive body has been told by its staff that Athens\u2019 reforms don\u2019t go far enough and the fund should not be involved in the troika\u2019s third, \u20ac86bn bailout. The paper says: The International Monetary Fund\u2019s board has been told Athens\u2019 high debt levels and poor record of implementing reforms disqualify Greece from a third IMF bailout of the country, raising new questions over whether the institution will join the EU\u2019s latest financial rescue. The determination, presented by IMF staff at a two-hour board meeting on Wednesday, means that while IMF staff will participate in bailout negotiations currently under way in Athens, the Fund will not decide whether to agree a new programme for months \u2014 potentially into next year. I\u2019m wrapping back for the day. Here are today\u2019s main events: The American, Irish and Spanish economies are powering ahead, the latest GDP figures showed. The Irish economy has grown to \u20ac189bn and is now bigger than in the \u201cCeltic Tiger\u201d boom days of 2007, before the credit crunch and global recession struck. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has called for an internal ballot (\u201creferendum\u201d) within his divided Syriza party on the bailout conditions on Sunday, although his preference is to hold an emergency party congress in September (after Greece is expected to have sealed its new bailout deal with the troika). In a defiant speech in an old movie theatre in Athens to Syriza\u2019s central committee, he defended the government\u2019s decision to accept the bailout. European stock markets have been buoyed by upbeat company results, including from Siemens, Nokia and Deutsche Bank, although concerns over China are evidently still a drag. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 is up 0.5%. Germany\u2019s Dax is back in positive territory, up 0.1%, after turning negative, France\u2019s CAC is 0.4% ahead and the FTSE 100 index in London has gained 0.3% to 6649.61. Alasdair Cavalla, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, says: This brings official data closer into step with other indicators, which had not noted a sharp difference between Q1 and Q2. The first-quarter figure was indeed softer due to a ports shutdown, poor performance in the mining sector and unseasonably bad weather, but the Bureau of Economic Analysis admitted that its statistical adjustment process is itself in need of some adjustment. This means that in contrast to the originally reported contraction, the US saw only a mild dip and is continuing to witness solid, but not stellar growth. Consumers are powering the recovery: the barometer of durable goods, which grows when people are confident enough to make larger purchases, showed a 7.3% jump in Q2 while consumption expenditure grew 2.9% overall. The housing market made a similarly strong contribution mirroring this strong sentiment. Investment shrunk slightly, though that reflects in part the weaknesses in oil and gas pulling down the figure for the broader economy. A surprising outturn came from exports, which are hampered by the strong dollar and generally weaker conditions in overseas markets. These recovered most of the ground lost in Q1, rising by 5.3%.\u201d Chris Williamson, chief economist at economic data firm Markit, says: Updated GDP numbers deliver a double-punch to US economy doom-mongers, painting a reassuringly bright picture of the health of the US economy so far this year and raising the odds of the Fed hiking interest rates in September Not only did the economy grow at a robust 2.3% annualised rate in the second quarter, the 0.2% downturn previously seen at the start of the year has been revised away to show growth of 0.6%. The new data, and the first quarter revisions in particular, remove a worrying sense of doubt about the health of the economy that will have given cautious policymakers a reason to hold back on hiking interest rates for the first time since rates were effectively cut to zero at the height of the global financial crisis.\u201d Consumer spending boosted US economic growth in the second quarter, as people used some of the savings made from cheaper gasoline to go shopping. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of US economic activity, rose 2.9%, versus 1.8% in the first quarter. A pick-up in the housing market, exports and government spending also underpinned growth. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. In the first quarter, GDP rose by 0.6%, rather than shrinking by 0.2% as previously estimated, with bad weather holding back the economy. Returning to Greece, here are the comments made by prime minister Alexis Tsipras to his party this morning, as reported by Reuters. In a defiant speech in an old movie theatre in Athens, he said: I propose to the central committee to hold an emergency congress to discuss being in power as leftists, our strategy in the face of bailout conditions. But there is another view, which is respected, that doesn\u2019t accept the government\u2019s analysis and believes there was an alternative available in the early morning hours of 13 July [when he accepted a bailout agreement with Greece\u2019s credits to avoid Grexit]. If this is the case... then I suggest the party hold a referendum on this crucial question. In other news, as readers have pointed out, Germany\u2019s FAZ newspaper is reporting that German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble wants to weaken the European Commission by removing the competition and single market departments. The paper says he believes the Brussels-based commission can no longer combine its role as \u2018guardian\u2019 of the EU treaties - including enforcing anti-trust and internal market rules - with its increasing political activities. This is what the International Monetary Fund said about Ireland back in March. In its annual assessment, the fund found that the Irish economy was \u201cstarting to fire on all cylinders\u201d, although the scars of the crisis were still visible in high unemployment, widespread mortgage arrears and house prices 38% below their peak. Then, the IMF forecast economic growth 0f 3.5% this year, much of it led by exports. Ireland\u2019s recovery is off to a good start in 2013\u201314, with some of the adverse legacies from the crisis beginning to heal However, ING economist Anthony Baert was more cautious. Ireland grew by 6.5% year-on-year in the first quarter. He said: Although over 6% yearly growth rates were not unusual for Ireland in the pre-crisis years, the current growth spurt still looks like catching-up speed rather than cruising speed. However, this process could still take some time. Despite the strong activity, the labour market is not performing as strong. At \u20ac189bn, the Irish economy is now bigger than at the height of the \u201cCeltic Tiger\u201d boom in 2007, before the financial crisis struck. Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Merrion Stockbrokers, said: It is quite clear that Ireland will easily top the eurozone growth league table for the second year running. Growth is now more likely to be in the 5-6% range for 2015, a positive boost for the government ahead of next year\u2019s general election.\u201d We\u2019ve also had Irish GDP figures today. Ireland had a strong start to the year, with economic growth of 1.4% in the first quarter. Growth in 2014 was revised higher to 5.2% from 4.8% \u2013 the highest growth rate since 2007 and the best performance in the European Union. Ireland\u2019s central bank upgraded its forecasts, predicting expansion of more than 4% for 2015 and 2016, which would make the country the best-performing economy in the EU again. For the back story, it is worth reading the New Yorker\u2019s excellent profile of the flamboyant former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, entitled The Greek Warrior. Just to clarify: the Greek prime minister proposed to Syriza\u2019s central committee to hold an emergency party congress in September \u2013 after Greece has sealed its new bailout deal with the troika, he hopes. He warned against deepening internal divisions by trying to decide the party\u2019s strategy in a hurry. But he also raised the possibility of holding an internal ballot on Greece\u2019s bailout deal on Sunday. Tsipras argued that the bailout deal was \u201cnot of our choice\u201d but the alternative was bleak: a disorderly default. Exit from the euro without reserves to support a new currency would have led to major devaluation and a return to the IMF, he told his party. ... or an internal ballot on the bailout conditions in September. Syriza hardliners however want to vote on the bailout deal as soon as possible. Looks like Tsipras may hold a party referendum on the bailout deal on Sunday. Tsipras has defended the Greek government\u2019s deal with creditors, saying it was \u201cnot of our choice\u201d. Speaking to his party\u2019s central committee, which runs Syriza, he said Greece faced a dilemma between a difficult compromise and a disorderly default. According to the Kathimerini newspaper, the Greek prime minister said: If someone believes another government could have brought back a better deal they should say so. He believes that his government has actually managed to stir up the EU. We created the first cracks in Europe\u2019s neoliberal hegemony. We have to give a definitive answer on whether a leftist government can exist in a liberal, conservative Europe. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: If Tsipras loses his grip on Syriza and the party splits, Greece could be plunged back into turmoil. It struck an 11th hour deal with international lenders earlier this month to keep Athens afloat with a new \u20ac86bn aid package \u2013 Greece\u2019s third bailout. But hardliners within the centre-left party rejected the deal and accused Tsipras of betraying Syriza\u2019s anti-austerity roots. The hardline Left Platform faction wants the government to ditch talks with the troika immediately and hold a party congress to determine its line. In a radio interview on Wednesday, Tsipras said he could be forced to call a snap general election if he loses his parliamentary majority, and suggested an emergency party conference could be held in early September. Tsipras has opened the Syriza central committee meeting at an old cinema in central Athens. European stock markets have been buoyed by upbeat company results, including from Siemens, Nokia and Deutsche Bank. Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.1% higher while France\u2019s CAC has gained 0.2%. European equities are heading for their third consecutive day of gains, as investors are also encouraged by the US Federal Reserve\u2019s latest comments. The Fed painted a bright picture in the jobs market when it left interest rates near zero last night, but did not appear more aggressive on the timing of its first interest rate hike (which could come as early as September). In the UK, 14 FTSE 100 companies have reported results, and Shell, AstraZeneca and Rolls-Royce are among the main risers. The index is trading more than 26 points higher at 6657.65, a 0.4% rise. While we are waiting for more news out of Greece, the European Commission has released figures that show economic sentiment in the eurozone improved this month. Its index rose to 104 from 103.5 in June. The Syriza central committee meeting comes as Delia Velculescu, the Romanian economist chosen to lead the International Monetary Fund\u2019s negotiating team in Greece, arrives in Athens. She was dubbed the \u201ciron lady\u201d during the talks over Cyprus\u2019s bailout. But Tsipras said on Wednesday he would not be blackmailed by his party\u2019s hardliners. He wants the Syriza central committee to agree to a party conference in September. He plans to hold a snap election after Greece has signed up to the \u20ac86bn third bailout. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras faces a showdown with his party\u2019s rebels today. Syriza\u2019s central committee, which is composed of 200 party members, including some MPs, will decide whether to hold a party conference immediately to decide its course. Nearly a quarter of Syriza MPs refused to back the bailout deal hammered out by the government with Greece\u2019s international creditors earlier this month. Greece\u2019s economy, meanwhile, is expected to shrink by 3.3% this year. More on Spain. Its centre-right government expects the economy to grow by 3.3% in 2015, which would outpace most of its eurozone peers. However, unemployment remains a huge problem: more than 5m people are out of work and the unemployment rate is at 22.4%. While the the number of jobless is staring to fall, many jobs are temporary and badly paid. The government expects the unemployment rate to fall back below 10% within the next three years. Economy minister Luis de Guindos said in a radio interview: We\u2019re starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. We are now able to return to pre-crisis income levels.\u201d Spain expects a record tourist season this summer, which should help growth in coming months. Inflation is now non-existent, with the latest reading at zero this month, down from 0.1% in June. Meanwhile in Germany, unemployment has unexpectedly gone up for the second month in a row. The number of jobless people climbed by 9,000 to 2.8m in July, the Federal Labour Agency said. However, the unemployment rate remained at 6.4%, the lowest since German reunification in 1990. Ol\u00e9! Spain\u2019s economy is powering ahead with 1% growth in the second quarter. This is the fastest rate of growth since 2007 and comes after 0.9% growth in the first quarter. We will get US GDP figures at 1.30pm London time. Rolls-Royce shares are also leading the FTSE 100 higher, even though half-year profits at the British defence and aerospace group more than halved to \u00a3310m. The market had already factored this in and breathed a sigh of relief that the engineering group did not issue another profit warning. Rolls also lifted its dividend by 3% to 9.27p a share. Rolls\u2019 new chief executive Warren East has his work cut out, as demand for the company\u2019s jet engines has been falling. His predecessor John Rishton retired in April for a \u201cchange in lifestyle\u201d. Read more here. AstraZeneca is the third-biggest gainer on the FTSE 100, trading 2.1% higher at \u00a342.81, after beating profit forecasts. It reported quarterly sales of $6.3bn, better than expected, while core earnings per share dropped 8% to $1.21. Revenues were boosted by income from spinning off assets, which offset competition from cheaper copycat versions of bestselling medicines such as its heartburn pill Nexium. Britain\u2019s second-largest drugmaker upgraded its revenue forecast for 2015 and now expects a low single-digit percentage decline, rather than a mid single-digit fall. Core earnings are still forecast to increase at a low single-digit rate. Berenberg analysts Alistair Campbell and Louise Pearson said: The product sales beat is pleasing, with a good performance from the diabetes franchise, which has disappointed over recent quarters. On the R&amp;D side we note that the company has finally disclosed that it has filed AZD9291 [one of its key new cancer drugs] with the [US regulator] FDA as part of a rolling submission. We see this product as key to the growth prospects of the oncology franchise and expect a rapid approval.\u201d Smith &amp; Nephew, which makes artificial hips and knees, is another big riser on the Footsie today, up 1.9% to \u00a311.57. Trading profit climbed 6% to $512m in the second quarter, with emerging markets continuing to post double-digit growth. Similar to Deutsche Bank, RBS is wrestling with heavy legal costs. It has been hit by \u00a31.3bn of charges for fines and compensation payouts to customers in the first half of the year, as our banking correspondent Jill Treanor reports. The bank\u2019s shares are up 1.4% at 358.2p, however, after it reported higher profits. Gas group BG Group and Shell, which is taking over BG, are the two biggest risers on the FTSE 100 index: BG is up 2.5% at \u00a310.65 while Shell has risen 2.2% to \u00a318.16. Here\u2019s our full story on Centrica and Shell. Spain\u2019s Santander, the biggest bank in the eurozone by market value, enjoyed an 18% rise in second-quarter profits to \u20ac1.7bn, boosted by the UK and the US which offset falling revenues at home. The UK now makes up just over a fifth of Santander\u2019s profits. Strong sales of camera sensors and PlayStation 4 video games have boosted Sony\u2019s profits by 39% to 96.9bn yen in the latest quarter. The results come after the Japanese company announced its first fund raising in a quarter of a century. It wants to use the money to make more image sensors, which are among its best-selling products \u2013 while smartphones and TVs have been hit by competition from cheaper rivals in Asia along with industry giants such as Apple and Samsung. Over in Europe, German airline Lufthansa sees no let-up in pressure on ticket prices and warned of a tougher second half, as it reported better profits and sales for the second quarter. Europe\u2019s largest carrier has introduced a new fare structure as it battles against competition from low-budget rivals Ryanair and easyJet. It will make passengers pay extra if they want to take more luggage, book a seat in advance or need a flexible ticket. Plans by Ryanair to slash winter fares will prove another headache for Lufthansa. \u201cWe do not see any relief on prices,\u201d said the airline\u2019s chief financial officer Simone Menne. \u201cThe competitive situation in Germany, as you can see from our rivals, is getting tougher, and the pressure in Asia is not easing.\u201d Deutsche Bank has a second-quarter pretax profit of \u20ac1.2bn, slightly below expectations. Germany\u2019s biggest bank set aside the same amount to cover fines and settlements, and warned that it may not reach its 2020 performance targets as a result. This is the first quarter for new boss John Cryan, the former finance chief of Swiss bank UBS, who has taken over from Deutsche\u2019s co-chief executive Anshu Jain, who quit on 1 July. Fellow co-CEO J\u00fcrgen Fitschen is due to leave next May. Cryan is expected to scale back the bank\u2019s large trading operations and push for deeper cost cuts and reforms, while resolving regulatory investigations, which could mean further large fines. Deutsche received a record $2.5bn penalty in the first quarter over attempts to manipulate interest rates. Like many other big banks, it is also under investigation for allegedly rigging foreign exchange markets. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Looks like the Athens stock exchange will not reopen this morning, and probably not tomorrow either. It may reopen on Monday. There\u2019s a huge amount of corporate news this morning, in the UK and Europe. Royal Dutch Shell is cutting 6,500 jobs this year, citing falling oil and gas prices. The energy giant, which is taking over BG, beat City forecasts with second-quarter adjusted profits of $3.8bn. British Gas owner Centrica is to cut 6,000 jobs \u2013 after doubling profits to \u00a3528m in the first half. Centrica boss Iain Conn has just been asked to explain this on BBC Radio 4. He said the first half of the year has been boosted by a cold spring, falling commodity prices and the way price cuts have been phased in. He added that profits in the second half will be down \u201csignificantly\u201d due to two price cuts for consumers. He also noted that the company is creating 2,000 jobs in other parts of the business at the same time. Royal Bank of Scotland has reported higher profits of \u00a3293m for the second quarter, up 27% from a year ago. And its chief executive Ross McEwan is hopeful that the \u201cbigger\u201d fines and settlements the bank has faced in past years are coming to an end. He told Radio 5 live: \u201cI\u2019m hoping we will finish the bigger ones [fines and litigation] this year. But it\u2019s in the hands of the regulators and courts.\u201d BT has also enjoyed a rise in profits to \u00a3694m, up 9%. Travel company Thomas Cook warned that the recent terrorist attack in Tunisia, and mounting concerns around Greece\u2019s potential exit from the euro, will drag down 2015 profits by about \u00a325m. It made a pretax loss of \u00a344m in the latest quarter, down from \u00a381m, saying summer bookings to most destinations are on track.",

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 is up 0.5%. Germany\u2019s Dax is back in positive territory, up 0.1%, after turning negative, France\u2019s CAC is 0.4% ahead and the FTSE 100 index in London has gained 0.3% to 6649.61.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-30T14:03:31.738Z\">at 3.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55ba26d2e4b0f74f1102b73b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-30T13:31:08.700Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Alasdair Cavalla, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This brings official data closer into step with other indicators, which had not noted a sharp difference between Q1 and Q2. The first-quarter figure was indeed softer due to a ports shutdown, poor performance in the mining sector and unseasonably bad weather, but the Bureau of Economic Analysis admitted that its statistical adjustment process is itself in need of some adjustment. This means that in contrast to the originally reported contraction, the US saw only a mild dip and is continuing to witness solid, but not stellar growth.</p> <p>Consumers are powering the recovery: the barometer of durable goods, which grows when people are confident enough to make larger purchases, showed a 7.3% jump in Q2 while consumption expenditure grew 2.9% overall. The housing market made a similarly strong contribution mirroring this strong sentiment. Investment shrunk slightly, though that reflects in part the weaknesses in oil and gas pulling down the figure for the broader economy. A surprising outturn came from exports, which are hampered by the strong dollar and generally weaker conditions in overseas markets. These recovered most of the ground lost in Q1, rising by 5.3%.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a48513e10fac1e75dc50caffd0a29ca09e9feff1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/30/1438263215706/81dded08-6b53-4315-9b62-f29f9748ad54-460x348.png\" alt=\"US GDP growth\" width=\"460\" height=\"348\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US GDP growth</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CEBR</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-30T13:33:49.617Z\">at 2.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55ba20fce4b05ceeceef2967\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-30T13:06:42.240Z\">2.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at economic data firm Markit, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Updated GDP numbers deliver a double-punch to US economy doom-mongers, painting a reassuringly bright picture of the health of the US economy so far this year and raising the odds of the Fed hiking interest rates in September</p> <p>Not only did the economy grow at a robust 2.3% annualised rate in the second quarter, the 0.2% downturn previously seen at the start of the year has been revised away to show growth of 0.6%.</p> <p>The new data, and the first quarter revisions in particular, <strong>remove a worrying sense of doubt about the health of the economy</strong> that will have given cautious policymakers a reason to hold back on hiking interest rates for the first time since rates were effectively cut to zero at the height of the global financial crisis.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55ba1d8be4b05ceeceef2956\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-30T12:56:51.504Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheSquareMile/statuses/626735824554622976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NOTABLE US GDP REVISION: &#10;&#10;Growth between 2011-14 was 2.0% not 2.3%--not a big difference, but helps explain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fed?src=hash\">#Fed</a> caution last year <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USD?src=hash\">#USD</a></p>&mdash; Ken Odeluga (@TheSquareMile) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheSquareMile/status/626735824554622976\">July 30, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/statuses/626736226566021120\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US economy obviously began growing earlier, but their \u2193 revisions and UK&#39;s \u2191 revision last yr making recoveries look increasingly similar.</p>&mdash; Mike Bird (@Birdyword) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/status/626736226566021120\">July 30, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55ba1aafe4b0f74f1102b6f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-30T12:40:57.325Z\">1.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Consumer spending boosted US economic growth in the second quarter, as people used some of the savings made from cheaper gasoline to go shopping.

      "bodyText": "Shell sees no quick end to the slump in oil prices and plans to further slash annual spending, sell off assets and bring the total number of job cuts to 6,500 by the end of 2015. But the Anglo-Dutch group has vowed to press on with its expensive and controversial exploration programme in Arctic Alaska, saying it was a \u201clong-term play\u201d that could not be influenced by current energy prices. Capital expenditure will be reduced by a further $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) meaning a fall of 20% overall across 2015 compared to last year while more than $30bn assets are to be disposed of by 2018 once its takeover of BG is complete. The company insisted its planned \u00a347bn merger with rival BG was still a good bet as it would help Shell be more competitive whatever crude\u2019s value. Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe have to be resilient in a world where oil prices remain low for some time. We have to be an attractive and resilient company at today\u2019s oil price, no matter how long this oil price will continue. We are acting with determination and urgency.\u201d He was speaking after reporting that second quarter profits had slumped 35% to \u00a33.36bn year on year and capital expenditure in exploration and production would fall 20% in total in the current financial year. Van Beurden said Shell was on track to complete the BG takeover next year and the combined group would see $30bn of assets hived off between 2016 and 2018. He said he wanted Shell to follow a \u201cgrow to simplify\u201d strategy concentrating on fewer but higher value projects. But van Beurden said the company was committed to pursuing its Chukchi Sea exploration in the Arctic, despite having spent $7bn with no financial return so far. He batted away suggestions at a results conference that such a high-cost project could not make sense with oil prices at their current levels of $54 per barrel, compared to $115 last June. Van Beurden said: \u201cIt\u2019s a long-term play with a very, very significant resource potential. The prospect we are about to drill this season, the Burger prospect, will have the potential to be multiple times larger than the largest prospects in the Gulf of Mexico.\u201d He said that funding was committed for this year and most of 2016, which made the project inflexible: \u201cYou cant turn it off and on whenever you feel like it.\u201d Earlier this year, Shell unveiled 250 job cuts in Aberdeen, but said the number has now moved to 500 with a further 250 in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. By the end of 2015 the cumulative total of all job cuts so far will be 6,500 - including contract staff - but Shell said it was too early to say how many more would go as spending is further reduced and more assets are sold.",

      "bodyText": "Ireland\u2019s economy has surpassed the size it reached at the peak of the \u201cCeltic Tiger\u201d boom, official figures have revealed, in the latest evidence that the country is shrugging off the legacy of the crash. Annual output reached \u20ac189bn (\u00a3132bn) in 2014, which statisticians said was larger, in real terms, than its pre-crisis level. Economic growth for last year was revised up, to 5.2%. Ireland\u2019s banks were brought to the brink of collapse when its property bubble burst in the wake of the global financial crisis, and after rescuing them, the Dublin government was forced to turn to its eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan in 2010. Ireland left the \u20ac67bn bailout programme 18 months ago, after implementing stringent austerity policies, and the economy has since recovered strongly. The upturn continued into the first three months of 2015, with GDP growth of a healthy 1.4%, putting it on track to be the fastest growing economy in Europe for the second year running. Separate data yesterday showed that another victim of the eurozone crisis, Spain, has recorded its strongest growth since 2007, before the global financial crash plunged the country into recession. Economic growth was 1% in the second quarter of the year, up from 0.9% in the first quarter, reaffirming the strength of Spain\u2019s recovery, and underlining the divide with more troubled eurozone economies such as Greece. Spain\u2019s centre-right government expects the economy to grow by 3.3% this year, although unemployment remains a huge problem with more than 5 million people out of work, an unemployment rate of 22.4%. Economy minister Luis de Guindos said in a radio interview: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. We are now able to return to pre-crisis income levels.\u201d Spain expects a record tourist season this summer, which should help growth in coming months. Inflation is now non-existent, with the latest reading at zero this month, down from 0.1% in June. \u201cWe draw encouragement from the acceleration in the pace of recovery,\u201d said Timo del Carpio, of RBC Capital Markets. \u201cToday\u2019s outturn should cement Spain\u2019s position ahead of many of its peers, and we forecast 3.1% growth this year and 2.7% in 2016.\u201d Analysts said weak inflation had boosted the buying power of Spanish consumers. \u201cLow inflation, accommodative financial conditions and, more importantly, improving labour market conditions are likely to have boosted private consumption,\u201d said Antonio Garcia Pascual, European economist at Barclays. The strong economic performance may help to underpin support for Spain\u2019s prime minister Mariano Rajoy, who faces a tough re-election battle in the autumn. Despite Spain\u2019s economic recovery, voters punished Rajoy for a series of corruption scandals in local elections in May, with both the anti-austerity Podemos (\u201cWe Can\u201d) party, and pro-market Ciudadanos (\u201cCitizens\u201d) polling well. Madrid was forced to ask its eurozone partners for financial support to rescue its troubled banking sector in 2012, but it \u201cexited\u201d the bailout in January 2014. Spain\u2019s banks were hit hard by the property crash that followed the global financial crisis, after a frenzy of speculative lending in the boom years that followed Spanish euro-entry.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Centrica is to cut 6,000 jobs, slash gas exploration and sell off its wind farms in a dramatic restructuring ordered by its new boss and former BP executive, Iain Conn. The move comes despite a doubling in profits at its British Gas residential power supply business in the first half of the year despite a further 45,000 customers being lost to rivals along the way. Conn promised Centrica would in future be more \u201ccustomer facing\u201d in its scaled down form but his eye is clearly on finding more favour with the City after a period when the share price has suffered badly. \u201cAlongside a major group-wide efficiency programme, this (new strategy) will underpin long-term shareholder value, as we target operating cash flow growth of 3-5% per year and deliver a progressive dividend policy,\u201d he said. The Centrica chief executive said he was hopeful of creating 2,000 new jobs in the energy services side which should reduce the overall scale of redundancies to 4,000, largely in the UK and mostly before the end of 2017. This would represent around 10% of the group\u2019s total. The jobs cull is part of a wider move to reduce annual spending by \u00a3750m come 2020 - helped by a plan to cut in half exploration and production from 80million barrels of oil equivalents to between 40m and 50m. The company said foreign assets in Trinidad and elsewhere are more likely to be sold off than North Sea fields although it admitted that its small but significant interest in UK onshore shale exploration is \u201cunder review.\u201d The remaining wind farms it owns are also to be hived off. The restructuring came after a six months review by Conn and while group adjusted operating profits for half year fell 3% at \u00a31bn. But earnings at British Gas residential doubled to \u00a3528m. Conn defended the British Gas results against immediate criticism from consumer groups. He said the company had cut its prices twice this year and while profit margins were high in the first half they would be all but wiped out again in the second. But Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which? said the rising profits at British Gas made it imperative that the company household power bills further. \u201cWhile it\u2019s good to see the new commitment from Centrica to focus on serving customers, with British Gas profits high and wholesale prices low, customers will no doubt wonder why cuts to their bills haven\u2019t gone further, and haven\u2019t included electricity, \u201c said \u201cThe Competition and Markets Authority has confirmed that household bills should be lower if the energy market was truly competitive. Following the CMA\u2019s blistering assessment of this sector, we expect big suppliers to pass on falling costs to their customers quickly and fairly.\u201d But there was a more positive reaction from City energy analysts at Jefferies investment bank. They concluded: \u201cCentrica\u2019s strategic review reflects the reality of a cash constrained world. Implementation will be challenging with no guarantee of success. But Centrica\u2019s management have at least now given shareholders a plausible business plan that offers a chance that the business can survive, and possibly flourish in the very challenging environment Centrica now operates in.\u201d The changes in job numbers at Centrica came on a bad day for those employed at energy companies with Shell also announcing plans to cut 6,500 staff and contractors worldwide. The price of oil has halved over the last 12 months has forced oil and gas companies onto the defensive and spending to be slashed. Shell saw its second quarter profits slump by 35% to \u00a33.36bn.",

The company said its TV section is at a two-year high after 60,000 customers were added in the three months to the end of June. In its first-quarter results, BT said it is on track to meet full-year expectations following solid demand for TV and broadband services. In 2013, BT finalised a deal with Uefa to exclusively broadcast Champions League matches from this year, beating BSkyB and ITV in the process. The additional customers over the past quarter leaves the BT television customer base at 1.2 million. BT Sport Europe, which will screen the Uefa matches, goes live on Saturday. The British broadband market leader reported core earnings up 1% to \u00a31.4bn for the first quarter, in line with market expectations. Profits before tax were \u00a3694m, up from \u00a3638m in the same period last year. Revenues in the broadband and TV divisions were up 7%. The company, which is buying the country\u2019s biggest mobile network, EE, said it expects merger approval on the deal by March 2016. BT re-entered the consumer mobile market last March. More than 100,000 customers had signed up in the first three months, the chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said. \u201cThe investments we are making in our business and customer service are building a strong platform for growth. And our financial results show we\u2019re on track to achieve our outlook for the full year,\u201d he said. BT said its results were lifted by an additional 217,000 customers taking its superfast fibre broadband service. Revenue came in at \u00a34.3bn, in line with forecasts and flat on an underlying basis, which marks an improving trend of the fourth quarter. While the strong performance from the consumer business meant the group maintained its full-year target, there were concerns about the Global Services division, which handles the IT needs of multinational corporations and governments, where revenue fell 4%. Patterson said the result at Global Services, which had in the past been the cause of two large profit warnings, tended to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but he noted the division had a strong order book.",

      "bodyText": "The new boss of Rolls-Royce has pledged to make the defence and aerospace group simpler and faster after it reported that profits have slumped by more than half. The FTSE 100 engineer said that pre-tax profits fell by 57% to \u00a3310m in the six months to 30 June as it suffered from falling demand for its jet engines. The results highlight the challenge facing Rolls\u2019 new chief executive, Warren East, who took charge after John Rishton said he was retiring in April for a \u201cchange in lifestyle\u201d. East said he would unveil the findings of his operational review of Rolls by the end of 2015 but that it will focus on adding \u201cpace and simplicity\u201d to the business. \u201cI am doing what any new CEO would do and getting my head around the operations, . I am looking at whether what we are doing is necessary, and could we do it faster and better. He added: \u201cI am not ruling anything in or anything out at this stage. But Rolls is a sound business.\u201d Rishton oversaw a tumultuous period for Rolls that included a string of profit warnings, the first fall in sales for a decade, and the Serious Fraud Office launching an investigation into corruption allegations. Earlier this month, East, who previously ran Arm Holdings \u2013 which designs microprocessors for Apple \u2013 was forced to issue another profit warning , the fourth in 18 months, on just his second day in the job. East said the profits warning showed Rolls \u201cisn\u2019t as resilient as everyone thought\u201d and is facing a period of significant transition as the business moves from a reliance on profitable engines such as the Trent 700, which it produces for the Airbus A330, towards new, more fuel-efficient engines such as the Trent 7000. However, he pointed to a \u00a32.8bn rise in the company\u2019s order book to \u00a376.5bn as evidence that Rolls remains well-placed for the future. \u201cThe continued growth in our order book demonstrates the long-term demand for our innovative products and services and underpins my confidence in the fundamental strength of our business,\u201d East explained. Shares in Rolls rose 18p, or 2.5%, to 748.5p with analysts welcoming the lack of further bad news and a 3% increase in the interim dividend to 9.27p per share Sandy Morris, analyst at Jefferies, said: \u201cWe believe the results are unremarkable \u2013 unless one chooses to find fault \u2013 but the 3% higher dividend is an important signal, in our view. \u201cWhat the results do contain is further and clearer guidance and commentary. We regard that as an important first step towards returning attention to how Rolls-Royce is best valued.\u201d Rolls is cutting more than 3,000 jobs in its aerospace and marine arms as it adapts to the slowdown in demand. This includes closing factories in Ansty in Warwickshire and East Kilbride in South Lanarkshire. As well as the pressure in civil aerospace, Rolls has suffered from falling demand for business jet engines and the impact of Russian sanctions. The decline in the price of oil has pushed profits in Rolls\u2019 marine arm down from \u00a340m to just \u00a34m. However, East said that Rolls had also \u201cmaybe underspent a bit in research and development\u201d and now planned to step-up investment to \u201cmake sure we are competitive\u201d. He added: \u201cThe tide is out and the rocks are a bit exposed.\u201d In civil aerospace, the company\u2019s biggest division, profits fell by almost half from \u00a3405m to \u00a3248m. This was caused by demand waning for the Trent 700 engine as Airbus prepares to launch a new version of the A330. This has led to sales falling and Rolls cutting the price of the engine as it battles with rivals Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric to attract any remaining customers. Overall, sales in the first half of 2015 fell by 3% on a comparable basis to \u00a36.3bn. East also said there was \u201cno particular update\u201d on the Serious Fraud Office\u2019s investigation into corruption allegations against Rolls. \u201cOf course it is an uncertainty hanging over us, but the reality is there are few levers that I can pull on that,\u201d he added. Alongside Rolls\u2019s results, BAE Systems, Britain\u2019s biggest defence manufacturer, reported a 6% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a3508m, although sales rose 12% to \u00a38.5bn. BAE produces the Typhoon fighter jet, the Astute-class submarines, and Britain\u2019s new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. It also makes parts for the F-35 Lightning jet.",

    "webTitle": "Thomas Cook profits hit by Tunisia attack and Greek debt crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook has warned that disruption caused by last month\u2019s terrorist attack on tourists in Tunisia and the Greek debt crisis will reduce the company\u2019s profits by about \u00a325m this year. The travel company said it cancelled almost its entire programme of Tunisia holidays this summer after a gunman killed 38 people, 30 of whom were British, on a beach in Sousse. Cancelled holidays, changes to flights and flying customers back from Tunisia will reduce underlying earnings before interest and tax by \u00a320m, Thomas Cook said. Demand for Greek holidays also dropped during the standoff between the Greek government and its creditors, forcing more discounting than expected. The cost to earnings will be a further \u00a35m, the company said. Thomas Cook revealed the cost of the crises as it reported a \u00a344m loss before tax for the three months to the end of June, its third quarter. The loss shrank from \u00a381m a year earlier. Underlying earnings for the quarter fell to \u00a330m from \u00a333m. The company said that before the scheduled trading update analysts had expected annual underlying earnings of about \u00a3340m, up from \u00a3323m last year. Analysts at the stockbroker Numis now forecast underlying earnings to fall to \u00a3309m this year. Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said demand for Greek holidays had returned to normal but that the group\u2019s results next year could be affected by continued doubts over Tunisia, which makes up about 10% of holidays booked by British customers at the group. The Foreign Office advises against travelling to Tunisia. Thomas Cook normally flies 35 planes a week to the north African country in the summer, delivering 630,000 holidaymakers. It flew more than 15,000 customers out of Tunisia after the attack on 26 June. Fankhauser said: \u201cFor next summer [in Greece] I expect a totally normal situation. For next year it\u2019s too early to say [regarding Tunisia] because there are too many factors, including the UK government\u2019s travel advisory and how successfully we can find alternative locations and holidays our customers will be happy with, so that is a business challenge as well.\u201d He said he expected Tunisia to become popular again as a holiday spot, but that Thomas Cook would have to decide whether to offer holidays there by November. \u201cTunisia is really a popular holiday destination with a great value for money product and we definitely expect it to come back ... Of course we are already now planning alternatives and putting up different scenarios: what if?\u201d he said. Thomas Cook\u2019s shares have fallen about 13% since the terrorist attack. The Numis analysts said: \u201cWe expect consensus forecasts to be cut quite substantially today \u2013 possibly by a double-digit percentage. We are cutting our [share] price target from 145p to 130p and see no rush to get involved in the shares.\u201d The group said the weakness of the euro and the Swedish krona against the pound would reduce annual profits by about \u00a339m compared with an earlier estimate of \u00a325m. Fankhauser, who became chief executive in November, said that excluding the currency movements and the Greek and Tunisian crises, Thomas Cook\u2019s performance was better than expected. It has sold 78% of summer holidays, unchanged from the year before. Bookings were unaffected by the company\u2019s handling of compensation for the parents of two children who died at a hotel in Corfu nine years ago, Fankhauser said. He met the parents of Bobby and Christi Shepherd in May and agreed to a financial gesture of goodwill following an outcry over Thomas Cook\u2019s treatment of the family.",

The cost to earnings will be a further \u00a35m, the company said.</p> <p>Thomas Cook revealed the cost of the crises as it reported a \u00a344m loss before tax for the three months to the end of June, its third quarter. The loss shrank from \u00a381m a year earlier. Underlying earnings for the quarter fell to \u00a330m from \u00a333m.</p> <p>The company said that before the scheduled trading update analysts had expected annual underlying earnings of about \u00a3340m, up from \u00a3323m last year. Analysts at the stockbroker Numis now forecast underlying earnings to fall to \u00a3309m this year.</p> <p>Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said demand for Greek holidays had returned to normal but that the group\u2019s results next year could be affected by continued doubts over Tunisia, which makes up about 10% of holidays booked by British customers at the group.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tunisia\">The Foreign Office advises against travelling to Tunisia</a>. Thomas Cook normally flies 35 planes a week to the north African country in the summer, delivering 630,000 holidaymakers. It flew more than 15,000 customers out of Tunisia after the attack on 26 June.</p> <p>Fankhauser said: \u201cFor next summer [in Greece] I expect a totally normal situation. For next year it\u2019s too early to say [regarding Tunisia] because there are too many factors, including the UK government\u2019s travel advisory and how successfully we can find alternative locations and holidays our customers will be happy with, so that is a business challenge as well.\u201d</p> <p>He said he expected Tunisia to become popular again as a holiday spot, but that Thomas Cook would have to decide whether to offer holidays there by November.</p> <p>\u201cTunisia is really a popular holiday destination with a great value for money product and we definitely expect it to come back ... Of course we are already now planning alternatives and putting up different scenarios: what if?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Thomas Cook\u2019s shares have fallen about 13% since the terrorist attack. </p> <p>The Numis analysts said: \u201cWe expect consensus forecasts to be cut quite substantially today \u2013 possibly by a double-digit percentage. We are cutting our [share] price target from 145p to 130p and see no rush to get involved in the shares.\u201d</p> <p>The group said the weakness of the euro and the Swedish krona against the pound would reduce annual profits by about \u00a339m compared with an earlier estimate of \u00a325m.<br></p> <p>Fankhauser, who became chief executive in November, said that excluding the currency movements and the Greek and Tunisian crises, Thomas Cook\u2019s performance was better than expected. It has sold 78% of summer holidays, unchanged from the year before.</p> <p>Bookings were unaffected by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/20/thomas-cook-says-sorry-over-handling-of-chidrens-deaths-compensation-case\">the company\u2019s handling of compensation for the parents of two children who died at a hotel in Corfu nine years ago</a>, Fankhauser said. He met the parents of Bobby and Christi Shepherd in May and agreed to a financial gesture of goodwill following an outcry over Thomas Cook\u2019s treatment of the family.</p>",

Shell is to cut 6,500 staff and contractors worldwide while Centrica, the owner of British Gas, wants 6,000 jobs to go, mainly in the UK. The cutbacks at Centrica \u2013 one of the big six domestic gas and electricity suppliers \u2013 is likely to cause a political storm as the British Gas arm doubled its profits to \u00a3528m. The price of oil has halved over the past 12 months, forcing oil and gas companies to go on the defensive and spending to be slashed. But Centrica has come under new management, which promised radical change. Shell saw its second-quarter profits slump by 35% to \u00a33.36bn, while Centrica\u2019s first-half adjusted operating profits profits were down by only 3% to \u00a31bn. Centrica, under its new boss, Iain Conn, says it wants to save \u00a3750m of annual cost savings by 2020 and plans to dispose of up to \u00a31bn of oil and wind assets. Conn, who was brought in from BP at the start of the year, said he was cutting back on North Sea exploration and production, as well as power generation but promised to keep investors happy. \u201cAlongside a major group-wide efficiency programme, this will underpin long-term shareholder value, as we target operating cash flow growth of 3-5% per year and deliver a progressive dividend policy,\u201d he said.",
