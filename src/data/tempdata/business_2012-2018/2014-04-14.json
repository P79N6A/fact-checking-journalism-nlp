While the unemployment rate fell in seasonally adjusted terms from 6.1% to 5.8% \u2013 the biggest drop since August 2010, and the fourth biggest in the past decade \u2013 the trend rate increased from 5.9% to 6.0% (although this was largely due to statistical rounding as the rate only went from 5.94% to 5.96%).</p> <p>So yes, this is good, but as I wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/17/labour-reports-taken-pinch-salt\">in March</a>, we need to be careful we aren\u2019t counting our chickens before they\u2019re in the pot:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/PZLAY/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Firstly, the number of full-time employed fell in March. This has happened 47 times in the past decade, and only on 10 of those occasions did that also coincide with the unemployment rate falling \u2013 and never by an amount as large as was seen in March. Also in all but one of those 10 cases, the following month saw an increase in the unemployment rate. So we should be glad the rate went down, but also cautious.</p> <p>When we get to the state level, the seasonally adjusted measure gets even more erratic, and really should be ignored. Western Australia for example saw its seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fall a whole percentage point, from 5.9% to 4.9% \u2013 the third biggest ever monthly fall in its unemployment rate. Its trend rate meanwhile increased from 5.1% to 5.3%.</p> <p>But even on trend terms it\u2019s clear that WA\u2019s employment growth is much improved. In June last year, for the first time in three years, its annual employment growth was below the national rate \u2013 down to a mere 1.0% annual growth compared to 5.5% in 2012.</p> <p>But now WA\u2019s annual employment is the strongest in the land, and in the past three months its full-time employment growth is the best out of the mainland states:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/bTzYo/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And even more odd given the narrative around the end of the mining boom, it is the mining states of WA, Queensland and the Northern Territory who are seeing the most growth:<br></p> <p>But counter intuitively, the employment isn\u2019t coming from mining.</p> <p>Total mining employment actually fell by 4,800 positions in Western Australia over the past year. And while an extra 6,200 people in Queensland were employed in mining, this made it only the fifth biggest growing industry in that state.</p> <p>The big growth industry in Queensland in the year through to February 2014 was the retail sector. An extra 21,700 people were employed in that industry in Queensland \u2013 an increase of 8.9% over the previous year. Rather stunningly, the second biggest growth employer was manufacturing.</p> <p>Manufacturing employment throughout Australia grew by only 1.8% in the past year, but in Queensland it grew by 7.5%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/F0bi9/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"600\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In most other cases having manufacturing being one of your main growth sectors is an indicator that your economy is going backwards. In South Australia, manufacturing jobs grew by the most \u2013 7,100 \u2013 but it is the worst performing state at the moment. It was the only state which in the past 12 months lost employment, and it remains the worst performer in the past three months as well.</p> <p>Western Australian employment in the past year has been powered by the construction industry. Despite the decline in growth of engineering construction associated with mining, the building sector has seen a sizeable increase in activity in the past year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Grogonomics graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/6H1sc/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In New South Wales, in which there has also been a large increase in the construction of buildings, there has also been a bigger decline in engineering construction. Thus it is not surprising that despite the state\u2019s housing boom, construction employment in New South Wales was not among the biggest growth sectors.</p> <p>But throughout the country, the construction sector provided the fourth largest number of new jobs in the past 12 months.</p> <p>In New South Wales and Victoria, the health sector remains the biggest new employer, as it is across the entire country.</p> <p>The employment figures last week certainly were a bit of unexpected good news. The figures themselves need to be viewed with caution. The seasonally adjusted measure did drastically improve, but national economies don\u2019t generally do u-turns with the swiftness of a Ferrari, and in that context it is not surprising that the trend rate rose again.</p> <p>The signs are there however that this period of employment gloom is nearing its end, and given the growth in construction and retail jobs, it may be that the Reserve Bank\u2019s efforts to kickstart the economy through low interest rates is finally working. Good news for those in all states, and also for those who have been out of work for well over a year.</p>",

So yes, this is good, but as I wrote in March, we need to be careful we aren\u2019t counting our chickens before they\u2019re in the pot: Firstly, the number of full-time employed fell in March. This has happened 47 times in the past decade, and only on 10 of those occasions did that also coincide with the unemployment rate falling \u2013 and never by an amount as large as was seen in March. Also in all but one of those 10 cases, the following month saw an increase in the unemployment rate. So we should be glad the rate went down, but also cautious. When we get to the state level, the seasonally adjusted measure gets even more erratic, and really should be ignored. Western Australia for example saw its seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fall a whole percentage point, from 5.9% to 4.9% \u2013 the third biggest ever monthly fall in its unemployment rate. Its trend rate meanwhile increased from 5.1% to 5.3%. But even on trend terms it\u2019s clear that WA\u2019s employment growth is much improved. In June last year, for the first time in three years, its annual employment growth was below the national rate \u2013 down to a mere 1.0% annual growth compared to 5.5% in 2012. But now WA\u2019s annual employment is the strongest in the land, and in the past three months its full-time employment growth is the best out of the mainland states: And even more odd given the narrative around the end of the mining boom, it is the mining states of WA, Queensland and the Northern Territory who are seeing the most growth: But counter intuitively, the employment isn\u2019t coming from mining. Total mining employment actually fell by 4,800 positions in Western Australia over the past year. And while an extra 6,200 people in Queensland were employed in mining, this made it only the fifth biggest growing industry in that state. The big growth industry in Queensland in the year through to February 2014 was the retail sector. An extra 21,700 people were employed in that industry in Queensland \u2013 an increase of 8.9% over the previous year. Rather stunningly, the second biggest growth employer was manufacturing. Manufacturing employment throughout Australia grew by only 1.8% in the past year, but in Queensland it grew by 7.5%. In most other cases having manufacturing being one of your main growth sectors is an indicator that your economy is going backwards. In South Australia, manufacturing jobs grew by the most \u2013 7,100 \u2013 but it is the worst performing state at the moment. It was the only state which in the past 12 months lost employment, and it remains the worst performer in the past three months as well. Western Australian employment in the past year has been powered by the construction industry. Despite the decline in growth of engineering construction associated with mining, the building sector has seen a sizeable increase in activity in the past year. In New South Wales, in which there has also been a large increase in the construction of buildings, there has also been a bigger decline in engineering construction. Thus it is not surprising that despite the state\u2019s housing boom, construction employment in New South Wales was not among the biggest growth sectors. But throughout the country, the construction sector provided the fourth largest number of new jobs in the past 12 months. In New South Wales and Victoria, the health sector remains the biggest new employer, as it is across the entire country. The employment figures last week certainly were a bit of unexpected good news. The figures themselves need to be viewed with caution. The seasonally adjusted measure did drastically improve, but national economies don\u2019t generally do u-turns with the swiftness of a Ferrari, and in that context it is not surprising that the trend rate rose again. The signs are there however that this period of employment gloom is nearing its end, and given the growth in construction and retail jobs, it may be that the Reserve Bank\u2019s efforts to kickstart the economy through low interest rates is finally working. Good news for those in all states, and also for those who have been out of work for well over a year.",

    "webTitle": "Citigroup revenues drop slightly as CEO acknowledges 'difficult quarter'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Citigroup announced slightly lower revenues for the first few months of the year on Monday as the bank worked to shed its \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d image and convince federal regulators it remains among the strongest banks in the US. Citigroup said it collected revenue of $20.1bn between January and March, a small drop compared to the same time a year ago. CEO Michael Corbat called it a \u201cdifficult quarter\u201d. Still, that translated to modestly higher profit of $4.1bn, a 4% improvement on last year. Citigroup created the boost, in part, by taking $673m it had previously set aside to cover the costs of bad loans, and counting that money as profit. While Citigroup\u2019s revenues were reasonably consistent with last year, they did not assuage the concerns of analysts who wondered why the bank has made no progress in passing the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cstress tests,\u201d which are designed to predict the strength of US banks in a financial crisis. Citigroup had hoped to pay dividends of $6.4bn to shareholders, but regulators thwarted the bank last month. The Federal Reserve has ruled, in two of the past three years, that Citigroup is not strong enough to return money to shareholders and still remain strong enough to withstand another financial crisis. Citigroup\u2019s failure is not due to a lack of trying. Chief financial officer John Gerspach said Citi has devoted 2,000 staffers \u2013 an enormous number \u2013 to the stress tests. About 500 of those employees spend 50% of their time working on the tests, he said, and the 1,500 others have some form of involvement. Several analysts quizzed executives about the failure during the company\u2019s 101-minute conference call about earnings, taking Corbat to task. \u201cFor shareholders, it\u2019s been two lost decades,\u201d said Mike Mayo, an outspoken analyst with CLSA who has previously criticized Citigroup. Mayo asked Corbat who would be accountable for the bank\u2019s inability to pass the stress tests. \u201cI am,\u201d Corbat replied. \u201cIt is something for which I am sure the board will hold me accountable when they reflect upon the year. I am accountable for it and I am accountable for fixing it.\u201d Mayo pressed on: \u201cIs the Fed denial a wake-up call for Citi, or not?\u201d \u201cThis obviously came as a disappointment,\u201d Corbat said. \u201cWe are not sitting here without a sense of urgency, and if anybody feels that way, they should not feel that way.\u201d Corbat only released one detail, when asked, in effect, whether Citigroup should \u201csimplify\u201d \u2013 with the implication being that the bank is still too big to fail and should be broken up. \u201cThe conversations [with the Fed] have not been about the business model or the strategy,\u201d Corbat said. Citigroup executives frequently talked about the bank\u2019s relationship with the Federal Reserve as if they were in counseling. \"We've started to get a much better understanding of their concerns,\u201d Gerspach told journalists about the bank\u2019s relationship with federal regulators today. He also advised reporters today not to focus on the past. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on the process,\u201d Corbat said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got several months of work to do here and we\u2019ve got a lot to deliver in terms of earnings and quality of earnings.\u201d Regulators, in particular the Federal Reserve, remember all too clearly that Citigroup required nearly $350bn in accumulated taxpayer support during the financial crisis, including a $20bn emergency infusion, a $25bn direct investment, and $300bn in backing for Citi\u2019s troubled assets. They have been careful not to let Citigroup \u2013 or other banks \u2013 get ahead of themselves. The bank recently cut 200-300 jobs, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, and its headcount hovered around 251,000 employees at the end of the year compared to 323,000 at the end of 2008. Citigroup\u2019s results were mixed in different businesses this quarter. The traditional Wall Street business of markets dropped overall by 12% compared to a year ago. Bond trading, the biggest part of Citigroup\u2019s markets business, weakened by 18%, bringing it to $3.85 billion; the bank attributed the drop to global \u201cuncertainty.\u201d Equity trading, or the stock business, accounted for a smaller portion of Citigroup\u2019s profits but grew 13% to $883 million. Citigroup saw strength in other businesses, however, particularly those affecting Main Street. The bank grew deposits by 3% to $988 billion, showing that consumers are keeping more money with Citigroup. Citicorp, which lends money to corporations and businesses, grew its loans by 7% to $575 billion. Citi Holdings, the part of the bank that presides over bad loans, mostly those held over from the mortgage crisis, decreased its credit losses by 44%, or $411m, compared to last year. That means that the division narrowed its loss to $284m in the first quarter, compared to $804m the year before. Still, the mortgage business does not appear to be improving much. Revenues in the bank\u2019s retail business fell by nearly one-quarter due to fewer homeowners eager to refinance.",

He also advised reporters today not to focus on the past.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re focused on the process,\u201d Corbat said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got several months of work to do here and we\u2019ve got a lot to deliver in terms of earnings and quality of earnings.\u201d</p> <p>Regulators, in particular the Federal Reserve, remember all too clearly that Citigroup required nearly $350bn in accumulated taxpayer support during the financial crisis, including a $20bn emergency infusion, a $25bn direct investment, and $300bn in backing for Citi\u2019s troubled assets. They have been careful not to let Citigroup \u2013 or other banks \u2013 get ahead of themselves.</p> <p>The bank recently cut 200-300 jobs, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, and its headcount hovered around 251,000 employees at the end of the year compared to 323,000 at the end of 2008.</p> <p>Citigroup\u2019s results were mixed in different businesses this quarter.</p> <p>The traditional Wall Street business of markets dropped overall by 12% compared to a year ago. Bond trading, the biggest part of Citigroup\u2019s markets business, weakened by 18%, bringing it to $3.85 billion; the bank attributed the drop to global \u201cuncertainty.\u201d Equity trading, or the stock business, accounted for a smaller portion of Citigroup\u2019s profits but grew 13% to $883 million.</p> <p>Citigroup saw strength in other businesses, however, particularly those affecting Main Street. The bank grew deposits by 3% to $988 billion, showing that consumers are keeping more money with Citigroup. Citicorp, which lends money to corporations and businesses, grew its loans by 7% to $575 billion.</p> <p>Citi Holdings, the part of the bank that presides over bad loans, mostly those held over from the mortgage crisis, decreased its credit losses by 44%, or $411m, compared to last year. That means that the division narrowed its loss to $284m in the first quarter, compared to $804m the year before.<br></p> <p>Still, the mortgage business does not appear to be improving much. Revenues in the bank\u2019s retail business fell by nearly one-quarter due to fewer homeowners eager to refinance.</p>",

The responses, from economists in the City, at thinktanks and universities, provide more food for thought over the permanence of the drop in GDP over the downturn.</p> <p>Economists were divided down the middle when asked whether they agreed the output gap \u2013 a measure of how far the level of output is below the potential level of output of the economy \u2013 was 3% or larger (in other words more than the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates). According to the OBR, the output gap in the last quarter of 2013 was 1.7%. That estimate implies that the drop in GDP relative to its pre-crisis trend, which may be as much as 10% on some estimates, is for the most part permanent.</p> <p>In this survey, 46% of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed the output gap was noticeably larger than the OBR estimate, among them Jonathan Portes of the NIESR thinktank and Morten Ravn from University College London. An equal number disagreed or strongly disagreed, and many of those commented that they supported the OBR estimate.</p> <p>On the second question, over the extent of long-term damage from the crisis, the economists were not as divided. Almost two-thirds (61%) thought that the financial crisis will either have no effect on long-term UK growth rates or a small negative effect that pushes GDP down by less than 2.5% in total over a 10-year horizon.</p> <p>But among those who disagreed with that view, several highlighted losses in the financial sector that may be felt for many years in the wider economy.

The first poll by the Centre for Macroeconomics asked just two questions, albeit meaty ones: on the size of the output gap and on the long-term effect on growth rates from the financial crisis. The responses, from economists in the City, at thinktanks and universities, provide more food for thought over the permanence of the drop in GDP over the downturn. Economists were divided down the middle when asked whether they agreed the output gap \u2013 a measure of how far the level of output is below the potential level of output of the economy \u2013 was 3% or larger (in other words more than the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates). According to the OBR, the output gap in the last quarter of 2013 was 1.7%. That estimate implies that the drop in GDP relative to its pre-crisis trend, which may be as much as 10% on some estimates, is for the most part permanent. In this survey, 46% of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed the output gap was noticeably larger than the OBR estimate, among them Jonathan Portes of the NIESR thinktank and Morten Ravn from University College London. An equal number disagreed or strongly disagreed, and many of those commented that they supported the OBR estimate. On the second question, over the extent of long-term damage from the crisis, the economists were not as divided. Almost two-thirds (61%) thought that the financial crisis will either have no effect on long-term UK growth rates or a small negative effect that pushes GDP down by less than 2.5% in total over a 10-year horizon. But among those who disagreed with that view, several highlighted losses in the financial sector that may be felt for many years in the wider economy. George Buckley at Deutsche Bank and John Driffill at Birkbeck College, London, both commented that growth before the financial crisis was unsustainable and that the financial crisis therefore could have an impact on growth rates by bursting that bubble. The Centre for Macroeconomics (CFM) \u2013 a partnership between the University of Cambridge, the London School of Economics (LSE), University College London (UCL), the Bank of England and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) \u2013 hopes its monthly reports will give a more comprehensive picture of the views of different economists and include the views of those experts \"whose opinions are not frequently heard in public debates.\" It hopes to tackle issues such as Scottish currency union, the inflation target and top tax rates over coming months.",

    "webTitle": "Carphone and Dixons merger: what's in it for Charles Dunstone?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There was a time when Sir Charles Dunstone liked to describe himself as \"just a little guy with a few shops\". Those days are long gone and, if talks to merge his Carphone Warehouse group with Dixons come to a successful conclusion next month, he will have created one of Europe's biggest retailers with an estate of more than 3100 stores stretching from London to Lapland. Investors like the deal, judging by the pop in both companies' shares when the talks became public. They understand the rationale from Dixons' point of view, because Carphone offers scale and expertise in the most valuable slice of the gadgets market. And there will be \u00a3100m or more of savings from combining back offices and overlapping operations in the UK, Ireland and Sweden. But there has been some head scratching about why Dunstone wants a merger. The official line is all about the connected home \u2013 where our phones will soon control our fridges. But for Carphone, an alliance with Dixons also has a defensive logic. The rumour on the high street is that Britain's four mobile phone networks, in the face of falling revenues and diminishing profits, are desperate not to put more money in Dunstone's pockets. They are out to kill Carphone. \"Economics has fuelled a rethink of distribution,\" says Shaun Collins of mobile analyst CCS Insight. \"Operators are seeking a way to de-emphasise third-party distribution, which they felt had got out of control and was costing them too much.\" Europe has forced through mobile price cuts, most recently on roaming, and revenues are falling across the board just as operators need to spend money installing 4G equipment. In France, financial pressure on the leading three networks by a well-funded new entrant called Free has forced them to retrench to their own retail outlets. The result was that Carphone called an orderly retreat, closing or selling its 250 Phone House stores last year. Last Christmas was worrying for the retailer. Revenues rose, but the number of customers connected across Europe fell 12.7% from 2.7m to 2.4m, as the demand for prepay phones in the UK collapsed. But industry watchers say leaving Carphone is easier said than done. Nobody is yet prepared to bet against Dunstone. \"The networks would like to be more reliant on their own direct channels and take the same route as Three, but they do too much volume through Carphone\" says Matthew Campelli at news site Mobile Today. \"There is a lot of noise, but they are all waiting for each other to show their hand.\" We have been here before. Vodafone pulled all its business from Carphone branches in 2006, after a dispute over how much commission it had to pay, and cosied up to smaller rival Phones4U instead. The standoff lasted three years, but in the end, Vodafone was forced to capitulate, having lost too much business to competitors. It swallowed its pride and returned to the fold in 2009. Five years on, Vodafone seems to be trying again. The difference this time is that it does not stand alone. Three, the UK's smallest network, pulled out of Carphone in November, because the retailer's offers repeatedly undercut those in Three's own shops. EE, the largest operator, called a review of all its retail partners in January, and O2 is publicly saying it will sell more from its own stores. Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao has made no secret of the fact that Carphone takes too large a slice of profits for his liking. He remains with Carphone for now, but clearly wants to become less dependent. In the coming year, Vodafone will add 150 new stores, bringing the total to 500. It will soon be impossible to find a high street in Britain that does not have a phone shop. The group will stay close to some partners: Phones4U has a brand that appeals strongly to younger consumers, many of whom view Vodafone as too corporate, so it adds value by pulling in subscribers Vodafone could not attract to its own stores. \"I'm aiming for a healthy mix of direct sales and partners, possibly fewer than we have today,\" said Jeroen Hoencamp, Vodafone's UK boss, as he announced the store openings. EE has made similar noises. In January all retail partnerships were put under review, and Britain's largest network revealed plans to increase an already huge estate of 600 stores, using the franchise model. Chief commercial officer Marc Allera said: \"We expect the outcome to follow our preference for fewer, deeper, longer term relationships with key partners who are prepared to share our network and service goals.\" Three pulled out of Carphone having already waved goodbye to Phones4U in 2012. Its departure barely moved the needle on Carphone's revenues, but it could have an impact in the long term. As a source at the network puts it: \"Three offered Carphone the figleaf of choice. But choice today choice is generally brokered through online comparison sites.\" In response, Carphone is investing \u00a310m in a sales system called Pinpoint. When customers come into the store, they will be shown Pinpoint's data on a tablet, and the data will include deals from Three. How strongly Carphone salespeople will recommend deals they cannot deliver remains open to question. Graham Stapleton, the Carphone UK chief executive, says, with 92,000 combinations of handsets and tariffs on offer each week, shoppers need his sales people more than ever. \"It has never been more important for someone to give you individual, personalised expert advice about your own specific needs. Phones are small computers now. They are the centre of people's lives so you want to make the right call. We still have the widest choice of networks to discuss with customers, and we have the widest range of handsets.\" Phones4U only sells Vodafone and EE contracts after O2 pulled out in February. Tim Whiting, the chief executive, argues that, with two networks and a multitude of handsets, he can meet any customer's need. \"Network operators will continue to work with partners that add value by giving their customers an excellent experience and an informed choice,\" he says. Networks can also hurt retailers by keeping the best deals for themselves. Despite a historically close relationship with Carphone, O2 is only offering its most eyecatching deal through its own stores. The Refresh tariff, which lets customers upgrade to the latest handset without having to wait until their two-year contract expires, was launched last summer and is all about reducing dependence on retail partners. \"I have a desire to do more business over time using the O2 proposition, but I wouldn't be naive enough to think I could reach the dizzy heights of 100%,\" says Feilim Mackle, the group's sales and service director. \"We'd like more customers to do business with us tomorrow than they do today, but that's not a numerically based target.\" O2 is under financial pressure. It bought less spectrum than Vodafone and EE at the recent auction of 4G airwaves. Its parent company, Spain's Telefonica, is heavily indebted and has been hurt by the deep recession in southern Europe. As well as leaving Phones4U, it has stopped selling contracts through Tesco, which now only stocks the operator's pay-as-you go SIM cards. But the networks are still heavily dependent on third-party retailers. According to some estimates, more than a third of all new customers who sign up go through either Carphone or Phones4U. Research firm Enders Analysis estimates 27% of Vodafone's current customer base arrived via the two retailers. For O2, the figure is 25% and for EE, which has more of its own stores than any other network, having been created through the merger of the Orange and T-Mobile brands, it is 23%. \"Carphone have always been brilliant at execution,\" says James Barford, Enders mobile expert. \"They've been good at picking up a lot of market share in tougher times, and their model remains extremely strong.\" Charles Dunstone biography Sir Charles Dunstone began selling mobile phones out if his flat in London's Marylebone Road when he was 25 years old. He floated Carphone Warehouse during the millennial dotcom frenzy, and nearly sank it six years later by announcing free broadband for all. It was an offer so attractive Dunstone was unable to keep up with demand, but he ploughed on and spun off the TalkTalk broadband business in 2010. It has since doubled in value, helping to divert attention from the 2011 failure of his electricals venture with America's Best Buy. With a 31% stake in TalkTalk, plus a 23% share of Carphone, Dunstone is now worth more than \u00a31.2bn A restless dealmaker with a Chipping Norton set social circle, he is as comfortable in the blokey business of mobile sales as he is behind the wheel of a yacht at Cowes. He gave up a long career as a bachelor to marry PR executive Celia Gordon Shute in 2009, and the couple now have two children. This November he turns 50, and by the time he blows out the candles, Dunstone may have signed off on his biggest deal yet - merging Carphone with Dixons would create a company with \u00a311bn in revenues and combined profits last year of more than \u00a3153m.",

The major way in which such a shock would be transmitted to central and western Europe would be through confidence, not through the direct impact of such tensions or of sanctions on trade.</p> <p>Our bottom line remains: yes, Russia has added a further tail risk to our fundamentally positive outlook for Europe.

      "bodyText": "Looking ahead, tomorrow is a bit busier on the data front. In the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is expected to say annual inflation fell to 1.6% in March from 1.7% in February. A supermarket food price war and lower petrol price inflation are expected to have brought the headline consumer price index measure of inflation down for the sixth month running. Official data later on Wednesday are expected to confirm the first rise in real pay for UK workers in four years. Read our story here. The British Retail Consortium's retail sales monitor for March, and ONS house price index for the same month, are also on Tuesday's agenda. Germany's latest ZEW survey of economic sentiment is also scheduled. In the US we have the empire state manufacturing survey, inflation and the Fed's Janet Yellen speaks at a conference. That's it for the blog today. Thank you for reading it and for all your comments. We'll be back again in the morning, please join us then. AM US markets are up in early trading, boosted by the strong retail sales data and a bigger than expected rise in Citigroup's first quarter profits. Dow Jones: +0.34% at 16,081.08 S&amp;P 500: +0.47% at 1,824.27 Nasdaq: +0.96% at 4,038.23 Three executives of the failed Anglo Irish Bank await their fate after being accused of falsely supporting the bank's share price. The Guardian's Henry McDonald reports from Dublin: The jury is out in one of the biggest financial crime trials in European history. Jurors are now deliberating at the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court over the fate of three executives from the defunct Anglo Irish Bank. Sean Fitzpatrick, Pat Whelan and William McAteer all deny charges that they gave out illegal loans to prop up the ailing bank's share price in the summer of 2008. The charges against the three bankers have been brought under section 60 of the Republic's Companies Act, the first time anyone has been prosecuted for that offence in Ireland. The Irish state has accused the trio of making available loans of up \u20ac619m (\u00a3512m) during that period to 10 rich investors as well as Sean Quinn - the now bankrupt former billionaire who was once Ireland's richest man - and his family. Anglo Irish Bank had to be rescued with billions of euros of taxpayers money, both Irish and European, to prevent its total collapse in 2010. Executives at the bank, both those on trial and others including its former chief executive David Drumm, became national hate figures during the recession in Ireland. But Judge Martin Nolan has warned the jury that the public\u2019s attitude towards banks and bankers is not on trial. The jurors have listened to 43 days of evidence in the case. \u201cWhatever prejudices you might have for or against bankers you must leave at the courtroom door or the jury room door,\u201d the judge said. European markets have rebounded slightly since the better than expected US retail sales. FTSE 100: -0.04% at 6,559.26 DAX: +0.04% at 9,319.14 CAC 40: +0.12% at 4,371.14 FTSE MIB: +0.07% at 21,213.06 IBEX 35: -0.6 at 10,142.90 US retail sales jumped 1.1% in March in the latest sign the world's largest economy is bouncing back following the harsh winter weather. It was the biggest rise since September 2012 and followed a 0.7% rise in February (revised up from a previous estimate of 0.3%) according to the US commerce department. The World Trade Organization has revised up its 2014 forecast for growth in global goods trade to 4.7% from an earlier forecast of 4.5%. Roberto Azev\u00eado, the WTO's director general, commented: \ufeffFor the last two years trade growth has been sluggish. Looking ahead, if GDP forecasts hold true, we expect a broad-based but modest upturn in 2014, and further consolidation of this growth in 2015. It's clear that trade is going to improve as the world economy improves. But I know that just waiting for an automatic increase in trade will not be enough for WTO Members. We can actively support trade growth by updating the rules and reaching new trade agreements. Co-op Group workers have urged board members to support the reforms recommended by Lord Myners, claiming their families' futures are on a \"knife edge\" as a result of the group's troubles. In a letter sent on behalf of workers by Unite the Union, the group\u2019s regional board members are asked to back reform and stop the politicking which is putting their livelihoods at risk. Here is an extract from the letter: \ufeffThe vast majority of our members appreciate the unique ethos of the Co-op and its\u2019 values and ethics are held in great regard. However the recent public politicking has caused great anguish for our members who fear that the board level power struggle is putting their livelihoods at risk. The future of the Co-op is not just about the make up of the board and the influence or perceived influence of regional boards and independent societies. It is also about the families of thousands of Co-op workers whose futures are on a knife edge. Unite believes that the basic proposals put forward by Lord Myners secure a structure that meets the organisation\u2019s needs and has the potential to meet the challenges faced in the current economic climate. We further believe that strengthening the \u2018one member one vote\u2019 principle returns the Co-op to its natural roots. We write this letter out of necessity because our members see no alternative. They see no viable \u2018plan B\u2019 coming forward that changes the governance structure that ensure we have a board in place with the knowledge, experience and skills to secure the future, not only of our members but of the Co-op as a whole. Lord Myners, the former chairman of Guardian Media Group and City minister during the banking crisis, resigned from the Co-op board last week as opposition mounted against his initial proposal to scrap the current boardroom. The group, which is being rocked by warring factions over the proposed shakeup, is poised to report at least \u00a32bn of losses on Thursday. Full story here. Economists are upbeat about first quarter growth prospects in the eurozone following those better than expected industrial output numbers for February. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg, had this to say: The eurozone recovery is on track. In the absence of any major geopolitical or financial stability accidents, it should not require large additional stimulus to keep going. A modest rise in industrial output by 0.2% mom in February puts the currency area on track for roughly trend GDP growth of 1.5-2.0% on an annualised basis in Q1. Due to a relatively mild winter, GDP growth may even hit the higher end of the range. The industrial output growth league table mirrors that of economic sentiment indicators, which puts Germany and Spain in the lead, with Italy in the middle and France towards the bottom of the field. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, is forecasting first-quarter growth of o.4% in the eurozone between January and March, compared with the previous quarter. A modest increase in industrial production in February supports belief that eurozone economic recovery is continuing to gradually firm. It looks likely that industrial production saw reasonable if unspectacular growth across the eurozone in the first quarter and made a positive contribution to GDP growth, which we expect to come in around 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. While the European Central Bank can take some reassurance from February\u2019s rise in industrial production as evidence that modest eurozone recovery is continuing to develop, the data will likely do little to ease the pressure on the ECB to take further stimulative action. GSK has responded to allegations of bribery in Poland, which were published by the BBC. One employee has been \"reprimanded and disciplined\". The full statement: \ufeffA GSK programme to assist in improving diagnostic standards and medical training, in order to benefit patient treatment and care with regard to respiratory disease, was run by doctors and other healthcare professionals in Poland. The programme ran from 2010 to 2012. Training on proper diagnostics for medical personnel and group meetings for patients were organised as part of this programme. These sessions were delivered by specialist healthcare professionals who, based on contracts signed with GSK, received payments appropriate to the scope of work as well as their level of knowledge and experience. The provision of sessions under this programme was agreed with the Polish healthcare centres. Following receipt of allegations regarding the conduct of the programme in the Lodz region, GSK has investigated the matter, using resources from both inside and outside the company. The investigation found evidence of inappropriate communication in contravention of GSK policy by a single employee. The employee concerned was reprimanded and disciplined as a result. We continue to investigate these matters and are co-operating fully [with the Polish authorities]. We agree [regarding issues raised by Panorama] there is a need to modernise interactions between the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare professionals to ensure patients' interests are always put first and to eliminate even a perception of a conflict of interest. This is why we have made, and will continue to make, fundamental changes to our business such as opening up access to our clinical trial data, changing how we pay our sales representatives and stopping payments to healthcare professionals for speaking engagements and for attendance at medical conferences. Industrial production in the eurozone came in slightly better than expected in February. It rose 0.2% on a monthly basis, and was better than January, when production was flat according to the region's statistics agency, Eurostat. The biggest increases were in Malta (+5.4%), and Ireland (+5.0%), while the biggest fall was in Estonia (-2.2%). It pushed the annual rate of growth in industrial production to 1.7%. In the wider European Union, industrial production was up 0.4% on a monthly basis and 2.1% annually. Oil prices have risen above $108 a barrel as the threat of military action against separatists by government forces in Ukraine has fueled concerns of supply disruption. Brent crude rose 80 cents to $108.13 after a 0.6% increase last week. US oil climbed 70 cents to $104.44. Economists at Berenberg have argued that although the tensions over Ukraine pose a risk to Europe's economy, the situation is unlikely to cause major disruption to recovery. Holger Schmieding, Berenberg's chief economist, says: Our base scenario remains that Putin will not go much beyond Crimea. While he will probably cause some mischief in Eastern Ukraine to make life difficult for the pro-European government in Kyiv, a rational Putin would not want to get to the brink of war and incur really painful sanctions that could push Russia's fragile economy into a deep recession. With the events of the last few days, the first risk scenario now much looms larger than before. It has not materialised yet and we still maintain our positive outlook. But we need watch carefully whether the tensions escalate further and the extent to which, and for how long, business and consumer confidence in Europe are hit by such tensions. With the euro crisis virtually over, external shocks such as a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine now pose the most serious threat to the ongoing European recovery. The major way in which such a shock would be transmitted to central and western Europe would be through confidence, not through the direct impact of such tensions or of sanctions on trade. Our bottom line remains: yes, Russia has added a further tail risk to our fundamentally positive outlook for Europe. But it is a tail risk. We have to watch it very carefully but do not expect it to materialise in a really disruptive way. Britain is in store for \"decent but unspectacular growth\" in a report out this morning by economic forecasters the EY Item Club. It has upgraded its growth forecast for this year to 2.9% from 2.7% against a backdrop of low inflation, rising wages, and a more balanced recovery. There is good news for households, with wage growth expected to outpace inflation this year following six years of falling real wages. Item is at odds with some commentators, playing down recent concerns about a UK housing bubble. Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to Item, says: The housing market is not experiencing a typical debt-fuelled recovery. Gross mortgage lending has increased but this has largely been financed by an increase in repayments by existing borrowers. New mortgage lending remains at rock bottom while government initiatives such as the Help to Buy schemes will be having little impact on prices in London, where activity is fuelled by cash rather than mortgage borrowing. The group predicted house price rises of 7% nationally this year and next, before moderating to 4.2% in 2016. Meanwhile property website Rightmove reports that sellers are attempting to cash in on a buoyant housing market by raising average asking prices in some London boroughs by more than 7% in a month. Read our full story here. The BBC is reporting that UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline is facing a criminal investigation in Poland for allegedly bribing doctors. Here is an extract from the BBC story, which follows an investigation from BBC Panorama: \ufeffEleven doctors and a GSK regional manager have been charged over alleged corruption between 2010 and 2012. A former sales rep said doctors were paid to promote GSK's asthma drug Seretide. The company said one employee had been disciplined and it was co-operating with investigations. If the allegations are proved, GSK may have violated both the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It is illegal for companies based in either country to bribe government employees abroad. A former sales rep for GSK in the Polish region of Lodz, Jarek Wisniewski, said: \"There is a simple equation,\" he said. \"We pay doctors, they give us prescriptions. We don't pay doctors, we don't see prescriptions for our drugs. Europe's investors are feeling bearish this morning following late losses on Wall Street on Friday and the escalating situation in Ukraine. FTSE 100: -0.15% at 6,552.09 DAX: -0.69% at 9,250.86 CAC 40: -0.24% at 4,355.27 FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 21,155.07 IBEX 35: -0.89% at 10,114.60 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. Mounting tensions between Ukraine and Russia over the weekend have hit markets this morning. The Moscow based Micex Index is down 1% at 1,348.79 after Ukraine set a deadline of this morning for pro-Russian separatists in eastern cities to disarm or face all-out attack. The rouble was down about 1% at 36 against the dollar and 0.7% weaker against the euro at 49.83. Meanwhile US wheat futures rose 2% as the heightened tension triggered fears of potential supply disruptions from one of the world's largest exporters. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, had this to say about the situation: \ufeffEvents over the weekend in the Ukraine aren\u2019t expected to help risk appetite after a crackdown on so-called Russian sympathising separatist forces at the weekend by Ukrainian forces from Kiev. The Ukrainian forces were sent into remove separatist forces from government buildings they had forcibly occupied in the east of the country. Any further flash points here could well reignite concerns about an escalation of tensions and further military skirmishes, particularly with the Russian military camped en-masse on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border. Against this backdrop European markets look set to start off on the back foot as we head into Easter, ironically at a time when some of the more recent economic data is starting to show signs of improvement, particularly in the UK and the US, with a raft of important announcements out this week, including UK inflation, unemployment and earnings data, as well as Chinese GDP and other economic data.

      "bodyText": "Supermarket giant Woolworths breached an undertaking it made to Australia\u2019s consumer watchdog to limit petrol discounts offered on grocery purchases to four cents per litre, the federal court has ruled. Woolworths and its rival Coles reached an agreement with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in December to cap the petrol discounts issued when customers purchased groceries from the supermarket arms of each business. The deals were heavily subsidised by the supermarkets, which in the case of Coles, bore up to 75% of the cost of the discounts offered at its service stations. The watchdog was concerned that the bundling tactic was unfairly crowding out smaller independent retailers, and could eventually see petrol prices increase. \u201cIf these shopper dockets continue at these levels it\u2019s going to be very hard for other players to compete and we may end up with just two companies in the country selling petrol,\u201d the ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said. In February, the ACCC launched legal proceedings against both supermarkets, alleging they had breached the deal by continuing to offer the bundled deals. The court ruled on Monday that Woolworths had breached its undertaking by offering a 4c petrol discount when customers spent $30 on groceries in its supermarket and then an additional 4c discount if they spent another $5 on convenience items in its service stations. \"It follows, in my opinion, that the 8c per litre discount on the single acquisition at retail of fuel was contingent on the acquisition of Woolworths supermarket (non-fuel) goods or services since, as a matter of the terms and conditions of the offer, the customer could not obtain that discount absent the customer's satisfying the prerequisite,\" Justice Robertson said.
