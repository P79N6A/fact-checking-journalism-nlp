      "bodyText": "The trade war between the US and other major economies escalated on Friday after Washington and Beijing launched punitive import tariffs on $34bn (\u00a325.7bn) worth of each other\u2019s goods. While economists say the consequences of a spat between the world\u2019s two largest economies can be contained for now, there are fears that Donald Trump\u2019s stance on trade could cause serious damage to the global economy. What is a tariff? Tariffs are border taxes charged on foreign imports. When a government or economic bloc (such as the EU) imposes a tariff on a particular product, importers pay the levy as a percentage of the total value of the product to the customs agency of that country, at the point of entry. They are imposed to increase the price of foreign goods to make domestic produce cheaper in comparison, with the aim of protecting local firms from global competition. According to tariff supporters, this can help to save jobs that might otherwise go overseas. Economists usually agree higher tariffs are counterproductive. While they can protect jobs in certain industries, they also tend to raise the price of goods for consumers and stifle innovation. Why is the US imposing tariffs? The root of the problem for Trump with Canada and Mexico stems from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), signed in 1994, which the president has called a \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cone of the worst deals anybody in history has ever entered into\u201d. The White House wants to renegotiate the terms of Nafta and is using import tariffs to apply pressure. When it comes to China, Trump believes Beijing is using \u201cunfair\u201d trade practices to gain an advantage on the US, including lax observation of intellectual property law. The president also takes issue with the size of the US trade deficit with China. Some economists question the accuracy of the official figures, yet the US Census Bureau shows America bought $376bn more of Chinese goods than the total value of all US goods sold in the Asian country last year. Trump has also called the state of trade between the US and the EU \u201cunfair\u201d, as official data shows a large trade surplus for the Europeans. Imports of cars from Europe \u2013 particularly Germany \u2013 are the primary source of complaint for the US president. What do the tariffs cover? The total value of the US tariffs on China amounts to $50bn, though they will come into effect in two tranches, with the first round covering 818 products worth about $34bn having come into force on Friday. A second round will cover 284 more products at a later date. Among the products on the list are nuclear reactors, boats, aircraft engines, semiconductors and a lengthy list of other industrial and agricultural machines. Trump\u2019s tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico are for as much as 25% on imports of steel and aluminium, which the US has imposed on grounds of national security. Have US trade partners retaliated? Beijing hit back on Friday with tariffs worth $34bn and has said it will match Trump\u2019s $50bn threat. China\u2019s retaliatory targets include soya beans, which will hit agricultural communities usually loyal to the president, as well as cotton, corn, tobacco and cars. Canada hit back by imposing tariffs on more than 100 US products, from ketchup to toilet paper, insecticide and washing machines. Mexico is targeting more than a dozen agricultural products, including pork and cheese. The EU, stung by the steel tariffs, has launched retaliatory tariffs worth $3.4bn on a wide variety of products, including whiskey, Levi\u2019s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Trump has threatened to hit back with car tariffs of 20%, which would be highly damaging for the German auto industry. What does it mean for the world economy? While Trump has argued trade wars are good and easy to win, most economists would say they are universally bad and easy to lose. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned last week that further escalation of Trump\u2019s trade disputes would hurt the American economy most, with potential to lower US economic growth by about 5%. The governor warned the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK.",

      "bodyText": "When Ryanair flies into a storm, it usually does so on a course charted with meticulous precision by chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary. The boss of Europe\u2019s largest airline has an unrivalled talent for generating publicity through controversy, adhering to the dogma that it doesn\u2019t matter what people say about Ryanair as long as they say Ryanair often enough. Now the airline is facing a summer of disruption, with pilots and cabin crew set to go out on strike at the worst possible time \u2013 summer holiday season. Pilots in Ireland will down joysticks on 12 July, while crew in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium, will walk out for 48 hours on 25 and 26 July. \u201cThe challenge is that it\u2019s the peak season and we don\u2019t know if the strikes will go ahead or to what extent,\u201d said John Strickland, director of independent transport consultancy JLS Consulting. \u201cThat\u2019s as much a challenge for Ryanair in planning solutions as it is for people travelling.\u201d Strickland said Ryanair would look to shuffle its crew around to minimise the impact and possibly ask customers to rebook on different flights. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to gauge the magnitude of disruption and you have to put it into the context of Ryanair\u2019s vast operations. But the scale of Ryanair\u2019s operations also means that quite a significant number of people could be affected,\u201d he said. One concern for Ryanair is that any cancellation comes with the memory of last winter\u2019s travails still relatively fresh. Thousands of passengers had their flights cancelled due to a blunder in the airline\u2019s staffing roster. Any further disruption could start to crystallise an image of Ryanair as a risky bet that makes paying an extra 10% or so for another airline seem like a good insurance policy. \u201cTheir brand is built on being reliable bastards,\u201d said Dan Gavshon Brady, a strategist at brand consultancy Wolff Olins. \u201cWhat the strikes threaten to do is question the reliability. They\u2019re more resilient than others because they\u2019ve never promised anything more than no-frills but deliver on what they promise. \u201cBut that also leaves them less margin for error, so when you get problems it threatens to affect your brand.\u201d At one stage last year, it looked as if Ryanair might avert any escalation of tension with its labour force. In a reversal of the airline\u2019s decades-old policy, O\u2019Leary agreed to recognise trade unions, something he has once claimed would be less preferable than cutting off his own hands. It seemed like a watershed moment, albeit one forced by the airline\u2019s staffing bungle. The mistake had left Ryanair desperately short of experienced pilots, giving them the whip hand over a management team keen to limit flight cancellations. O\u2019Leary\u2019s subsequent damascene conversion into a reluctant trade unionist was reminiscent of his 2013 vow to start being nicer to passengers \u2013 one made by necessity, through gritted teeth. A little more than six months later and unions representing both pilots and crew say recognitionhas not developed into engagement with their grievances. This time, while pilots in Ireland remain dissatisfied and plan to strike on 12 July, it is cabin crew who are most aggrieved. They have long complained of poor pay and working conditions and meagre employment rights as a result of Ryanair\u2019s model of employing them via third-party agencies. As the Guardian revealed last year, they are also subjected to disciplinary proceedings and public shaming if they do not hit sales targets designed to help Ryanair flog more scratchcards and perfume. Multiple crew unions, assisted by the the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, have delivered a list of 34 demands to the company. The implication is that more strikes will follow unless the company comes to the negotiating table. \u201cThe onus is now on Ryanair,\u201d said ITF general secretary Stephen Cotton. \u201cEnsure that workers get the treatment they deserve, or more national unions may decide that strikes are the only way to make the company listen. \u201cRyanair has started to change, but we believe the culture at the top needs to change too in order to deliver on the promises it has made. \u201cThe close-knit corporate governance model that has been a feature of the company thus far is no longer appropriate for a major airline. An increase in independent representation on the board would give us greater confidence that Ryanair is serious about a new approach.\u201d But Ryanair\u2019s rapid growth and financial success remain core strengths and not everybody is convinced it will see the need to change. Chris Tarry, founder of aviation consultancy Ctaira, said: \u201cWhilst this changes the rules of engagement at Ryanair the fact is that it starts from a position of the lowest costs and is consistently the most profitable airline. \u201cThere are different dynamics and flexing of muscles by labour but it\u2019s all clearly manageable.\u201d",
