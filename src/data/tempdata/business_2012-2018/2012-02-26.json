      "bodyText": "Let's hope the euphoria that greeted last week's economic data lasts longer than the cheers England's footballers can expect this summer when the European championships get underway. There is nothing more traditional than football supporters putting hope ahead of experience in the run-up to the competition's first match \u2013 only to have those hopes dashed. Were those economists who reached for their rattles and scarves after two months of better than expected figures similarly naive? It certainly felt like a Mexican wave of cheering after the GDP numbers on Friday. Strangely the second attempt to measure the economy's output in the last three months of the year was no better than the first. The Office for National Statistics still came up with the same poor result \u2013 a 0.2% contraction. If anything the picture was gloomier after the ONS said the third quarter result should be downgraded. As a result growth for 2011 as a whole was 0.8%, registering one of the worst annual growth rates following a recession in the UK's history. A storming recovery it is not. So what was so cheering? A more detailed look at the figures revealed a mini surge in consumer spending during January following a decent Christmas for high street retailers. Government spending was also stronger than ministers predicted after 4% growth over the year. Surveys of key economic sectors added to the sense of relief. Reports for the last two months found manufacturers and services companies, which account for about 85% of output, in a more optimistic frame of mind. Sales were up and orders were healthier. Services, which covers everything from IT and telecoms to the City and hotels, gained for a third month, its best performance for two years. Against the backdrop of the euro crisis, this was seen as quite a feat. Alan Clarke, chief economist at Scotia Bank of Canada, and Chris Williamson, the chief economist at data provider Markit, were among many to declare a double dip recession unlikely such was the renewed vigour among shoppers and Whitehall mandarins for spending, and companies for selling stuff. But the situation could be short lived. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, argues that the CBI's shops survey and GFK/NOP's consumer confidence poll next week \"will provide significant clues as to whether the consumer is genuinely perking up or whether January's robust sales were primarily driven by people looking to take advantage of the clearance sales and they are still reluctant to spend significantly\". Archer is sceptical the recovery in consumer spending has any legs, especially as it is largely driven by debt and in the face of rising unemployment. Among middle income consumers, the spending taps were turned on at the expense of paying down their mortgages at a faster rate. At the bottom end of the income scale spending increased after consumers turned to payday loan sharks for cash. The Consumer Credit Counselling Service says in a report on Monday that despite a slight reduction in the overall debt level of UK households since the recession and historically low base rates, debt servicing is an increasing burden. It says: \"At the end of last year, the average household was paying almost \u00a3200 per month in interest, representing nearly a quarter (23.8%) of available income.\" It found that the rising price of essential items outweighed wage increases and thus reduced discretionary income. The charity predicts the number of people with crippling debts seeking advice would hit an all-time high in the next two years as the after-effects of maintaining living standards on credit take their toll. Earlier his month the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development predicted unemployment would rise to almost 3m as public sector jobs continued to disappear as part of the government's austerity measures and the private sector shed jobs to increase productivity. With more people out of work, the number of low income households turning to the CCCs is going to rise further. Contrast the situation with the US. Consumer spending and confidence are increasing there too. New home sales are improving and exports are up and unemployment is falling. After a couple of terrible years that have pushed unemployment above 10%, spending figures are tied to genuine rises in average disposable incomes as more people find jobs. OECD figures last week for 2012 showed the world economy was close to recession without the positive lift from the US.

    "webTitle": "Why Bombardier's bid for Crossrail means so much to Litchurch Lane", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bombardier train factory in Derby is an unlikely symbol of Britain's manufacturing revival. The blackened brickwork of its 172-year-old worksheds is a symbol of the area's proud rail heritage, while the Canadian flag outside its entrance signifies that, like other major UK manufacturers, it is under foreign ownership. On the other side of the tracks by the city's main station, there is a depressing glimpse of the future. Bright signs for hotels, software companies and car dealerships cut through the drizzle, filling the space where steam engines were once made at the defunct locomotive works. The government is finalising tender documents for a \u00a31bn contract to build carriages for the Crossrail project. Winning that contract will be critical to keeping Britain's last remaining train factory open and the competition is expected to begin imminently. If Bombardier loses the race \u2013 as it did last year, when a \u00a31.4bn government contract for trains on the London Thameslink route saw preferred bidder status awarded to Siemens of Germany \u2013 the Derby site is unlikely to survive beyond the middle of the decade. Before a visit by Prince Charles to the site on Friday, Bombardier employees talked of the site's legacy. Pride and history is felt as keenly as the short-term need for jobs here. Kevin Owen, 41, a team leader at the plant and a prominent online campaigner for its survival, is among the 1,600 surviving employees who despaired at the loss of the Thameslink deal. He has seen 1,200 colleagues leave in the wake of that decision and, through his Made in Britain blog, is urging ministers to give Derby the order to build 60 trains for the \u00a316bn Crossrail link. \"When we got the Olympics there was all this talk of legacy,\" says Owen, walking towards the site where he began his professional life as an apprentice in 1987. \"I believe that leaving this site and this company stronger than I found it would be leaving a legacy for the next generation. \"And that's what the government should do. They should not come in to power and shut an industry, they should fight tooth and nail for this.\" The works in Litchurch Lane are still busy. The historic buildings house modern assembly lines. A newly constructed London Underground train, its white, red and blue colour scheme standing out in the murk, sits between two worksheds. Outside the gates, an old carriage is transported to a scrapyard, illustrating the replacement cycle on Britain's crowded commuter lines that feeds Bombardier's business. That circle, however, is on the verge of breaking. The London Underground order finishes in 2015, a deal for carriages on the Southern route will run out in 2013 and a mooted contract to build 35 carriages for the CrossCountry franchise has yet to be signed. This month, the Canadian group's transport boss, Andr\u00e9 Navarri, said that such a hand-to-mouth existence was not good enough. Crossrail is vital. \"The small orders cannot make a UK presence competitive,\" he said. Industry analysts say that if the UK is to tilt its economy away from financial services and boost manufacturing's share of GDP beyond the 10% it accounts for already, then facilities like Litchurch Lane must survive. The secretary of Bombardier's works committee, John Woods, 60, is proud of the campaign that launched last summer after the implications of the Thameslink decision became clear. A rally in Derby drew 10,000 people and a media furore over the latest blow to British manufacturing contributed to the Southern success, as well as heavy ministerial hints that a CrossCountry deal was looming. \"I like to think that [campaign] is what won the Southern order,\" says Woods, a member of the Unite trade union. His colleague Graeme Steeples, 51, says the focus now is \"making sure we get Crossrail\". Neither employee is willing to concede that Thameslink is entirely lost, because Siemens has yet to sign the contract and Bombardier remains reserve bidder. But a reversal is highly unlikely. Indeed, scrutiny of the reams of documents that underpinned the Thameslink process underlines why Bombardier was always going to struggle. Papers unearthed by Derby North MP Chris Williamson following a freedom of information request reveal a rigorous and competent procurement process launched by the then Labour government in 2007 and 2008. It was painstakingly put together in an exemplar of labyrinthine bureaucracy. Amid minutes for meeting after meeting and endless tweaks to contract specifications, phrases such as \"sub-optimal\", \"public private partnership\" and \"value\" abound. There are no references to the \"equal footing\" that the government is now scrambling to guarantee for the Crossrail contract. It is an environment stripped of all notion of domestic bias by European Union procurement rules, and not a world in which pleas to preserve nearly two centuries of domestic manufacturing will thrive. David Faircloth, 65, a former train buyer for British Rail who also worked in procurement for Bombardier, says the decision to change the procurement method by combining the financing of the trains with their manufacture was crucial in Siemens winning preferred bidder status. Many observers say that financing, and Siemens's superior balance sheet, was the crucial factor. \"It is clear that they did not consider the effect that bundling would have. It just was not on the horizon at all,\" says Faircloth, referring to the planning documents. Williamson says that the Crossrail competition must take a different approach: \"These papers expose an alien culture in the Department for Transport, where officials are so obsessed by bureaucracy that they've forgotten what is in the national interest.\" However, EU regulations prohibit member states from showing domestic bias in selecting the winners of government-funded contracts. The other bidders for Crossrail are Spain's CAF, Japan's Hitachi and Siemens, all of whom would have recourse to legal action if they suspected a rigged contest. Non-UK manufacturers also bridle at the notion of bias on the continent, pointing out that the recent Eurostar procurement, which went to Siemens, proved that French businesses are not duty-bound to pick home-built Alstom vehicles. It is understood that the Crossrail tender document, which stipulates the type of vehicle the government is seeking and the structure of the deal, will be significantly different from the Thameslink effort. But it will not have a \"buy UK\" clause, which still gives a strong chance to other contestants when the winner is announced in 2014. A former Department for Transport employee says the current transport secretary will struggle to politicise the Crossrail process. \"Many civil servants view British industry and jobs as political side issues that get in the way of procurement. Senior DfT civil servants and rail officials tend to keep ministers and the [business] department at arm's length during procurement decisions, stating that EU legislation demands no political interference.\" The next generation of Bombardier workers is hoping that British industry has a stronger chance in the Crossrail contest than it did in Thameslink. Kieran Pallett, 20, who is more than two years into his apprenticeship, says during his lunch break that he hopes Prince Charles's royal visit on Friday will \"give us a good image\" and help secure his future. \"I want to progress myself as far as I can here. They support you really well at Bombardier.\" But it is Bombardier, and UK industry, that needs support too and there is only so much the government can do.",

Bright signs for hotels, software companies and car dealerships cut through the drizzle, filling the space where steam engines were once made at the defunct locomotive works.</p> <p>The government is finalising tender documents for a \u00a31bn contract to build carriages for the Crossrail project. Winning that contract will be critical to keeping Britain's last remaining train factory open and the competition is expected to begin imminently. If Bombardier loses the race \u2013 as it did last year, when a \u00a31.4bn government contract for trains on the London Thameslink route saw preferred bidder status awarded to Siemens of Germany \u2013 the Derby site is unlikely to survive beyond the middle of the decade.</p> <p>Before a visit by Prince Charles to the site on Friday, Bombardier employees talked of the site's legacy. Pride and history is felt as keenly as the short-term need for jobs here. Kevin Owen, 41, a team leader at the plant and a prominent online campaigner for its survival, is among the 1,600 surviving employees who despaired at the loss of the Thameslink deal. He has seen 1,200 colleagues leave in the wake of that decision and, through his <a href=\"http://kevinjowen-madeinbritain.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">Made in Britain</a> blog, is urging ministers to give Derby the order to build 60 trains for the \u00a316bn Crossrail link.</p> <p>\"When we got the Olympics there was all this talk of legacy,\" says Owen, walking towards the site where he began his professional life as an apprentice in 1987. \"I believe that leaving this site and this company stronger than I found it would be leaving a legacy for the next generation.</p> <p>\"And that's what the government should do. They should not come in to power and shut an industry, they should fight tooth and nail for this.\"</p> <p>The works in Litchurch Lane are still busy. The historic buildings house modern assembly lines. A newly constructed London Underground train, its white, red and blue colour scheme standing out in the murk, sits between two worksheds. Outside the gates, an old carriage is transported to a scrapyard, illustrating the replacement cycle on Britain's crowded commuter lines that feeds Bombardier's business.</p> <p>That circle, however, is on the verge of breaking. The London Underground order finishes in 2015, a deal for carriages on the Southern route will run out in 2013 and a mooted contract to build 35 carriages for the CrossCountry franchise has yet to be signed. This month, the Canadian group's transport boss, Andr\u00e9 Navarri, said that such a hand-to-mouth existence was not good enough. Crossrail is vital. \"The small orders cannot make a UK presence competitive,\" he said.</p> <p>Industry analysts say that if the UK is to tilt its economy away from financial services and boost manufacturing's share of GDP beyond the 10% it accounts for already, then facilities like Litchurch Lane must survive.</p> <p>The secretary of Bombardier's works committee, John Woods, 60, is proud of the campaign that launched last summer after the implications of the Thameslink decision became clear. A rally in Derby drew 10,000 people and a media furore over the latest blow to British manufacturing contributed to the Southern success, as well as heavy ministerial hints that a CrossCountry deal was looming.</p> <p>\"I like to think that [campaign] is what won the Southern order,\" says Woods, a member of the Unite trade union. His colleague Graeme Steeples, 51, says the focus now is \"making sure we get Crossrail\".</p> <p>Neither employee is willing to concede that Thameslink is entirely lost, because Siemens has yet to sign the contract and Bombardier remains reserve bidder. But a reversal is highly unlikely. Indeed, scrutiny of the reams of documents that underpinned the Thameslink process underlines why Bombardier was always going to struggle.</p> <p>Papers unearthed by Derby North MP Chris Williamson following a freedom of information request reveal a rigorous and competent procurement process launched by the then Labour government in 2007 and 2008. It was painstakingly put together in an exemplar of labyrinthine bureaucracy. Amid minutes for meeting after meeting and endless tweaks to contract specifications, phrases such as \"sub-optimal\", \"public private partnership\" and \"value\" abound.</p> <p>There are no references to the \"equal footing\" that the government is now scrambling to guarantee for the Crossrail contract. It is an environment stripped of all notion of domestic bias by European Union procurement rules, and not a world in which pleas to preserve nearly two centuries of domestic manufacturing will thrive.</p> <p>David Faircloth, 65, a former train buyer for British Rail who also worked in procurement for Bombardier, says the decision to change the procurement method by combining the financing of the trains with their manufacture was crucial in Siemens winning preferred bidder status. Many observers say that financing, and Siemens's superior balance sheet, was the crucial factor.</p> <p>\"It is clear that they did not consider the effect that bundling would have. It just was not on the horizon at all,\" says Faircloth, referring to the planning documents.</p> <p>Williamson says that the Crossrail competition must take a different approach: \"These papers expose an alien culture in the Department for Transport, where officials are so obsessed by bureaucracy that they've forgotten what is in the national interest.\"</p> <p>However, EU regulations prohibit member states from showing domestic bias in selecting the winners of government-funded contracts. The other bidders for Crossrail are Spain's CAF, Japan's Hitachi and Siemens, all of whom would have recourse to legal action if they suspected a rigged contest.</p> <p>Non-UK manufacturers also bridle at the notion of bias on the continent, pointing out that the recent Eurostar procurement, which went to Siemens, proved that French businesses are not duty-bound to pick home-built Alstom&#xa0;vehicles.</p> <p>It is understood that the Crossrail tender document, which stipulates the type of vehicle the government is seeking and the structure of the deal, will be significantly different from the Thameslink effort. But it will not have a \"buy UK\" clause, which still gives a strong chance to other contestants when the winner is announced in 2014.</p> <p>A former Department for Transport employee says the current transport secretary will struggle to politicise the Crossrail process. \"Many civil servants view British industry and jobs as political side issues that get in the way of procurement. Senior DfT civil servants and rail officials tend to keep ministers and the [business] department at arm's length during procurement decisions, stating that EU legislation demands no political interference.\"</p> <p>The next generation of Bombardier workers is hoping that British industry has a stronger chance in the Crossrail contest than it did in Thameslink. Kieran Pallett, 20, who is more than two years into his apprenticeship, says during his lunch break that he hopes Prince Charles's royal visit on Friday will \"give us a good image\" and help secure his future. \"I want to progress myself as far as I can here. They support you really well at Bombardier.\"</p> <p>But it is Bombardier, and UK industry, that needs support too and there is only so much the government can do.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Berry Bros & Rudd: ready for new growth after maturing for 300 years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Squint through the elegant arched windows of Berry Bros &amp; Rudd's famous store in London and you half-expect to see sombre clerks using quills to scratch orders in the giant ledgers that fill its shelves. But while the interior of the capital's oldest wine merchant, with its high panelled walls and cosy back parlour, has changed little since the shop opened more then 300 years ago in Mayfair, the family-owned business is preparing for a new era. The swollen ranks of Berrys, Rudds and in many instances new branches of the clans called \"something completely different\" means the ownership structure will have to change. \"There are 50 in the next generation,\" says chairman Simon Berry, who is a scion of the seventh generation. \"We are looking very seriously at how to cope with this and at the different models used by other family businesses.\" Berry says the family motto is \"never stop changing\": \"We didn't get something right in 1698 and cling to it. You have to adapt; that is what family businesses are good at.\" The store, No 3 St James's Street, is a postcard from Georgian London with the worn, uneven floor testament to the passage of the years. The dark wood and high desks make it feel like a club you need to pass wine exams to enter. \"Some people think the shop might be intimidating and if they pronounce the name of the wine wrong we will say 'off you go to Oddbins',\" jokes Berry. The price range of the thousands of wines on sale spans \"supermarket top shelf\" to \"sharp intake of breath\": two selections at random from the burgundy list might be a \"zippy and lip-smackingly fresh\" Maison Roche de Bellene that would give you change from a \u00a320 note, or a \u00a3118 bottle from premier-league appellation Charmes-Chambertin. The political debate about \"predator\" capitalism has seen alternative ownership models such as employee-owned John Lewis attract renewed respect \u2013 not least as a growing number of private-equity-backed firms sink under the weight of their debts. Dr Ajay Bhalla at Cass Business School in London says family businesses typically \"don't grow very fast\" but their willingness to invest over the long term means there is less \"boom and bust\". He highlights success stories such as Merck, the German pharmaceutical giant, and Warburtons the bakers. It is important that the next generation of owners is apprenticed in the business, rather than arriving out of the blue with an MBA, says Bhalla. Fifty-year-old Berry, who started visiting the shop when he was five, became chairman after 30 years' service, in addition to several years working for wine producers such as Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon and Mouton-Rothschild. \"Family businesses don't exist to give jobs to unemployed members,\" says Berry firmly. This commitment is perhaps one reason why the company has been able to weather both the South Sea bubble and the credit crunch. The walls of the parlour at the back of the store offer a walk through history, with framed prints of Spy caricatures from Vanity Fair lampooning the politicians and aristocrats of days gone by \u2013 ranging from a prelapsarian Duke of Windsor to the Aga Khan \u2013 who were also its monied clientele. There is also a gallery of Berrys and, later, Rudds, including Berry's great-great-great grandfather George, who boasts formidable sideburns. \"For a family business to survive you have to be very professional and go out and recruit the best non-family executives,\" says Berry, reeling off a list of outsiders including managing director Hugh Sturges and former Allied Domecq chief executive Philip Bowman. And ideas on how to integrate future family members into the business include forbidding those who don't work for Berry Bros, which last year had sales of \u00a3215.8m, from owning shares, or drawing up a code setting out stiff conditions to be met when applying for a post. Last year's decision to sell Cutty Sark, the whisky brand it created in 1923, was \"family led\", says Berry, explaining: \"We sold Cutty Sark while it was still profitable. We don't have the advertising budget to support an international brand so it was likely to be squeezed out.\" Now it is concentrating on a diverse portfolio of luxury brands that includes The Glenrothes single malt, \"No 3\" London gin, liqueur The King's Ginger and its most recent addition, Pink Pigeon: an \"ultra-premium\" vanilla rum from Mauritius aimed at nightclub-goers. \"In a drinks portfolio you have to spread your bets,\" Berry says. \"We were interested to see if the team we had could create something sexier.\" Berry Bros, which is predominantly a mail-order business, tends to have regarded new technology as an opportunity. In 1994 it became the first wine merchant to launch a website and over the years has embraced blogging, social networking (sales director Simon Staples, \"@BigSiTheWineGuy\", has 3,700 Twitter followers) and launched the Berrys' Broking Exchange, an \"eBay for fine wine\" that lets customers sell and buy wines stored privately in temperature-controlled cellars in Basingstoke. The web, says Berry has made wine \"more democratic\". \"It offered customers who were fearful of seeming ignorant grateful anonymity. They can ask their questions to a computer screen.\" Bhalla says strong \"family governance\" is key to successful founder-run companies: \"How does a family view its role in the business? Is it there to spend or be a guardian of the wealth?\" Whatever the difficulties Berry Bros may face in the future, a family schism of that type is unlikely to be a problem. \"We have disagreements but tend not to have rows,\" Berry says. \"We have never had a vote: we reach a consensus.\"",

      "body": "<p>Squint through the elegant arched windows of Berry Bros &amp; Rudd's famous store in London and you half-expect to see sombre clerks using quills to scratch orders in the giant ledgers that fill its shelves.</p> <p>But while the interior of the capital's oldest wine merchant, with its high panelled walls and cosy back parlour, has changed little since the shop opened more then 300 years ago in Mayfair, the family-owned business is preparing for a new era. The swollen ranks of Berrys, Rudds and in many instances new branches of the clans called \"something completely different\" means the ownership structure will have to change.</p> <p>\"There are 50 in the next generation,\" says chairman Simon Berry, who is a scion of the seventh generation. \"We are looking very seriously at how to cope with this and at the different models used by other family businesses.\"</p> <p>Berry says the family motto is \"never stop changing\": \"We didn't get something right in 1698 and cling to it. You have to adapt; that is what family businesses are good at.\"</p> <p>The store, No 3 St James's Street, is a postcard from Georgian London with the worn, uneven floor testament to the passage of the years. The dark wood and high desks make it feel like a club you need to pass wine exams to enter.</p> <p>\"Some people think the shop might be intimidating and if they pronounce the name of the wine wrong we will say 'off you go to Oddbins',\" jokes Berry.</p> <p>The price range of the thousands of wines on sale spans \"supermarket top shelf\" to \"sharp intake of breath\": two selections at random from the burgundy list might be a \"zippy and lip-smackingly fresh\" Maison Roche de Bellene that would give you change from a \u00a320 note, or a \u00a3118 bottle from premier-league <em>appellation</em> Charmes-Chambertin.</p> <p>The political debate about \"predator\" capitalism has seen alternative ownership models such as employee-owned John Lewis attract renewed respect \u2013 not least as a growing number of private-equity-backed firms sink under the weight of their debts. Dr Ajay Bhalla at Cass Business School in London says family businesses typically \"don't grow very fast\" but their willingness to invest over the long term means there is less \"boom and bust\". He highlights success stories such as Merck, the German pharmaceutical giant, and Warburtons the bakers. It is important that the next generation of owners is apprenticed in the business, rather than arriving out of the blue with an MBA, says Bhalla.</p> <p>Fifty-year-old Berry, who started visiting the shop when he was five, became chairman after 30 years' service, in addition to several years working for wine producers such as Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon and Mouton-Rothschild. \"Family businesses don't exist to give jobs to unemployed members,\" says Berry firmly.</p> <p>This commitment is perhaps one reason why the company has been able to weather both the South Sea bubble and the credit crunch. The walls of the parlour at the back of the store offer a walk through history, with framed prints of Spy caricatures from <em>Vanity Fair</em> lampooning the politicians and aristocrats of days gone by \u2013 ranging from a prelapsarian Duke of Windsor to the Aga Khan \u2013 who were also its monied clientele. There is also a gallery of Berrys and, later, Rudds, including Berry's great-great-great grandfather George, who boasts formidable sideburns.</p> <p>\"For a family business to survive you have to be very professional and go out and recruit the best non-family executives,\" says Berry, reeling off a list of outsiders including managing director Hugh Sturges and former Allied Domecq chief executive Philip Bowman. And ideas on how to integrate future family members into the business include forbidding those who don't work for Berry Bros, which last year had sales of \u00a3215.8m, from owning shares, or drawing up a code setting out stiff conditions to be met when applying for a post.</p> <p>Last year's decision to sell Cutty Sark, the whisky brand it created in 1923, was \"family led\", says Berry, explaining: \"We sold Cutty Sark while it was still profitable. We don't have the advertising budget to support an international brand so it was likely to be squeezed out.\"</p> <p>Now it is concentrating on a diverse portfolio of luxury brands that includes The Glenrothes single malt, \"No 3\" London gin, liqueur The King's Ginger and its most recent addition, Pink Pigeon: an \"ultra-premium\" vanilla rum from Mauritius aimed at nightclub-goers.</p> <p>\"In a drinks portfolio you have to spread your bets,\" Berry says. \"We were interested to see if the team we had could create something sexier.\"</p> <p>Berry Bros, which is predominantly a mail-order business, tends to have regarded new technology as an opportunity. In 1994 it became the first wine merchant to launch a website and over the years has embraced blogging, social networking (sales director Simon Staples, \"@BigSiTheWineGuy\", has 3,700 Twitter followers) and launched the <a href=\"http://www.bbr.com/fine-wine/bbx\" title=\"\">Berrys' Broking Exchange</a>, an \"eBay for fine wine\" that lets customers sell and buy wines stored privately in temperature-controlled cellars in Basingstoke.</p> <p>The web, says Berry has made wine \"more democratic\". \"It offered customers who were fearful of seeming ignorant grateful anonymity. They can ask their questions to a computer screen.\"</p> <p>Bhalla says strong \"family governance\" is key to successful founder-run companies: \"How does a family view its role in the business? Is it there to spend or be a guardian of the wealth?\"</p> <p>Whatever the difficulties Berry Bros may face in the future, a family schism of that type is unlikely to be a problem. \"We have disagreements but tend not to have rows,\" Berry says. \"We have never had a vote: we reach a consensus.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Many years ago a Treasury friend, Mike Mercer, and I coined a word with an ancient Greek derivation. It has not yet made it to the reference books, but one lives in hope. The word was \"euphobia\", or \"fear of good news\". The context was the way in which, after the dramatic sterling crisis of 1976, from which the Labour government never quite recovered, the pound became much too strong for the international competitiveness of British industry. A strong pound seemed like good news; but there was such a thing as excessive strength, leading, paradoxically, to weakness. It is doubtful whether there is much incidence of euphobia in modern Greece at the moment. The latest rescue operation seems to be generally regarded not so much as helping to keep the show on the road as merely postponing a catastrophe. Closer to home, however, there have been elements of good news that are being talked up by those with a vested interest in doing so. But the news is certainly not so overwhelming as to merit a bout of euphobia. As Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, recently commented: \"Although some recent business surveys suggest a brighter picture for activity\u2026 the fiscal consolidation and tight credit conditions at home, and the weakness of our major overseas trading partners, are acting as a drag on growth.\" Always to be relied upon for a good turn of phrase, the governor has predicted a \"zigzag\" pattern of growth this year, warning that any enthusiasm about a possible upturn this quarter \u2013 after the October-December contraction \u2013 is unlikely to be sustained. The Bank keeps telling us that things will improve as the reduction in the rate of inflation eases the squeeze on purchasing power. But the fact is that there is still a squeeze. Indeed, reports from the Bank's impassive network of regional agents suggest that the economy may still, in Ed Balls's phrase, be \"flatlining\". The Bank says one of the factors contributing to a lower inflation rate is that from now on \"the increase in the standard rate of VAT a year ago drops out of the calculation. In fact, last year's increase in VAT has dropped into the equation: the monthly inflation figure is being compared with figures that were boosted by the January 2011 increase in VAT. The baseline for the year-on-year comparison is higher, therefore the increase, ceteris paribus, is less. The Bank has faced a certain amount of criticism, but it has been right to make the inflation target of 2% a very distant one. The overwhelming priority is to try to do something about the level of unemployment, especially among the young; acting precipitately to tighten monetary policy during a depression would have been a major mistake. This said, I have every sympathy with those many people whose pensions are being reduced to pitifully small levels by the impact of easy money on annuity rates. I have spent most of my career avoiding the thorny subject of pensions, but there must be a better way of calculating them after a long working life. The squeeze on real incomes has been caused not only by the rise in VAT, but also by the impact of the earlier devaluation of the pound, and higher energy prices. What is more, if there is a conflict between Israel and Iran, all bets are off when it comes to energy prices and the possibility of further reductions in the inflation rate. Thanks to the Obama administration's fiscal stimulus, output in the US is already back to pre-recession levels, whereas it looks as though the Bank does not expect Britain to be in this position until 2013 \u2013 to which I am tempted to add \"if then\". While not going as far as President Reagan, who once joked \"I don't worry about the deficit \u2013 it's big enough to take care of itself\", I do think we should not lose sight of the salient fact: the main culprits were the banks, whose preposterous \"business model\" misled the Treasury, the Bank and the Brown government into believing there was an endless flow of revenue coming from the financial sector. Not to put too fine a point upon it, the financial sector turned out to be a liability, not an asset. As the Bank's Andrew Haldane says in an article (\"The Doom Loop\" in the London Review of Books): \"The evolution of banking ... has satisfied the immediate demands of shareholders and managers, but has short-changed everyone else.\" He urges action to curb \"the profit-seeking incentives of the equity minority\", noting that \u2013 how's this for short-termism? \u2013 \"average holding periods for US and UK banks' shares fell from around three years in 1998 to around three months by 2008\". Robert Neild, emeritus professor of economics at Cambridge University, has conducted an exhaustive historical study of the course of the national debt. He notes in the Royal Economics Society's January newsletter: \"Britain, a leader in the management of government finances, has maintained a national debt without default for more than three centuries.\" The ratio of debt has often been far higher than today, and \"since 1970 the debt-to-GDP ratio has not changed greatly\". Figures from Eurostat showed the UK with debt at 80% of GDP in 2010, against 82% in France and 83% in Germany. Neild concludes that the chancellor has been unnecessarily alarmist, with the kind of counterproductive effects produced by similar policies in the 1930s. As Dr Anthony Eisinger of the Royal College of Physicians commented last week: \"Why are governments so frightened of conducting a U-turn? If doctors find they have made a mistake, they don't persevere with a diagnosis that will kill the patient.\"",
