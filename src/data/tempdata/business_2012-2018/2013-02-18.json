The pharmaceutical industry has to show its drugs are not harmful before they are marketed: the avoidance industry would have to show its schemes were not injurious to the nation's financial health. But life is made easy for the avoidance industry because the complexity of the tax system provides too many loopholes and the existence of offshore tax havens provides too many boltholes.

      "bodyText": "Sterling's days as a safe haven currency are over for now. Hedge funds are selling more pounds than they are buying for the first time in five months. The speculators are heading for the exit. The diminished status of the UK currency in the eyes of international investors was illustrated by the reaction to the weekend's hollow words about currency manipulation. Two currencies took a thumping when trading reopened on Monday: the Japanese yen, which is being deliberately depreciated by Tokyo, was one; sterling, which dropped to a seven-month low against the dollar at one point, was the other. To be sure, there will be good trading sessions for the pound, and Wednesday may be one of them if the latest unemployment figures show a fresh fall in joblessness and the minutes of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee's February meeting suggest no hurry to give the economy a fresh stimulus. But the smart traders will sell into any rally, knowing it is unlikely to last. That's not just because the outgoing Bank governor, Sir Mervyn King, made it clear last week that he favoured a cheaper currency in order to help exports. Nor is it because King's successor, Mark Carney, has hinted that he will take an even more relaxed approach to hitting the government's 2% inflation target than the current regime. These factors have certainly done nothing to provide support for the pound but the selling had been occurring before King or Carney opened their mouths. Nor, for that matter, is the sell off due to a sudden reappraisal of the UK economy's strengths and weaknesses. The prospects for rapid growth in Britain look poor, but they looked poor a year ago when the hot money was flowing into London and all the talk was of sterling as a bulwark of stability. Some analysts say the threat of one or more of the credit rating agencies stripping the UK of its AAA status has led to the smart money getting out well ahead of any announcement, but this sort of talk has been around for months. Instead, the explanation for the pound's fall is simple: the negative factors depressing the value of other currencies have gone away leaving the negative factors affecting sterling evident for all to see. So while few wanted to take a punt on the euro a year ago when it appeared to be on the brink of collapse, the soothing words of Mario Draghi have removed that threat, at least for the time being. A second risk, that the US would stumble off the fiscal cliff, has also been removed, as has a third: a hard landing in Japan. Investors have not suddenly woken up to the idea that Britain is a flat-lining economy with a twin deficit problem. They have known that for some time. The difference is that a year ago there were other more pressing things to worry about. Now there are not. That makes the pound a big sell.",

Two currencies took a thumping when trading reopened on Monday: the Japanese yen, which is being deliberately depreciated by Tokyo, was one; sterling, which dropped to a seven-month low against the dollar at one point, was the other.</p> <p>To be sure, there will be good trading sessions for the pound, and Wednesday may be one of them if the latest unemployment figures show a fresh fall in joblessness and the minutes of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee's February meeting suggest no hurry to give the economy a fresh stimulus.</p> <p>But the smart traders will sell into any rally, knowing it is unlikely to last. That's not just because the outgoing Bank governor, Sir Mervyn King, made it clear last week that he favoured a cheaper currency in order to help exports. Nor is it because King's successor, Mark Carney, has hinted that he will take an even more relaxed approach to hitting the government's 2% inflation target than the current regime. These factors have certainly done nothing to provide support for the pound but the selling had been occurring before King or Carney opened their mouths.</p> <p>Nor, for that matter, is the sell off due to a sudden reappraisal of the UK economy's strengths and weaknesses. The prospects for rapid growth in Britain look poor, but they looked poor a year ago when the hot money was flowing into London and all the talk was of sterling as a bulwark of stability. Some analysts say the threat of one or more of the credit rating agencies stripping the UK of its AAA status has led to the smart money getting out well ahead of any announcement, but this sort of talk has been around for months.</p> <p>Instead, the explanation for the pound's fall is simple: the negative factors depressing the value of other currencies have gone away leaving the negative factors affecting sterling evident for all to see. So while few wanted to take a punt on the euro a year ago when it appeared to be on the brink of collapse, the soothing words of Mario Draghi have removed that threat, at least for the time being. A second risk, that the US would stumble off the fiscal cliff, has also been removed, as has a third: a hard landing in Japan.</p> <p>Investors have not suddenly woken up to the idea that Britain is a flat-lining economy with a twin deficit problem. They have known that for some time. The difference is that a year ago there were other more pressing things to worry about. Now there are not. That makes the pound a big sell.</p>",

      "bodyText": "US online grocer Fresh Direct is hailed as a saviour by New Yorkers starved of choice for supermarkets in their space-squeezed metropolis. However, devotees of the service include not just Upper East Side residents but also one of Britain's least web-savvy supermarket chains: WM Morrison. The Bradford-based grocer holds a 10% stake in the business and has a team embedded in the firm. As temperatures plummeted to -11C last month, the team was taking notes as Fresh Direct delivery vans worked overtime to ensure New Yorkers did not have to brave the chill winds to pick up their granola, orange juice and organic milk. Morrisons announced the acquisition of 49 stores from failed DVD and games rental chain Blockbuster this weekend as it seeks to increase its presence in the UK convenience store market, but the company's main problem is not a shortage of bricks and mortar. The lack of a home delivery service in Britain was singled out as a key factor in a 2.5% drop in like-for-like sales in the runup to Christmas, which means chief executive Dalton Philips is looking at Fresh Direct for inspiration. At the time of the $50m (\u00a332m) Fresh Direct investment in 2011, Philips said: \"What we learn from Fresh Direct will be invaluable as we plan our own profitable e-commerce business for the UK.\" Fresh Direct makes a profit and has expanded into several territories outside its New York metropolitan heartland, including a launch last month in the Greater Philadelphia area. Some experts, however, warn it will be difficult for it to grow outside densely populated areas and also question what its heavily urbanised customer base has in common with that of Morrisons. Fresh Direct was founded in 1999 by a former investment banker, Jason Ackerman, and grocery retailer Joe Fedele with a mission to sell farm-fresh food, time and convenience to harried New Yorkers. It operates out of a warehouse in Long Island City, New York State, and made its first delivery in 2002. It now has 250,000 customers, makes more than $400m in annual sales and claims to have been profitable for the last couple of years. Like the UK's Ocado, it is a purely online service. It sells about 3,000 varieties of perishable food, as well as household brands sold at, it claims, supermarket-beating prices. Its popularity has prompted a trend for luxury apartment blocks to boast refrigerated rooms for the doorman to store deliveries. There is no doubt New Yorkers are evangelical about Fresh Direct. They should be, given the alternative. The city is served largely by independent stores and a few tired but expensive supermarket chains. Large chains such as Fairway, Whole Foods Market and Trader Joe's are scarce and driving to a supermarket is not an option for the majority of New Yorkers who do not own cars. Charlotte Carter, 32, a mother to two children, is not the only New Yorker to describe herself as \"Fresh Direct's biggest customer\". Living in an apartment block on Manhattan's salubrious Upper West Side and married to Joel, 33, an investment banker, she fits Fresh Direct's customer profile. \"Supermarkets here are quite hectic, packed full and high with narrow aisles. Everyone's in such a hurry. There's no slow browsing or you get a trolley in the ankles. I don't have a car and have to carry shopping to a taxi. It's easier for someone to bring it to my apartment which is 12 storeys up,\" she says. Fresh Direct has solved a problem for this unique customer demographic, according to Sucharita Mulpuru, an e-commerce expert at consultancy firm Forrester Research, but she questions how its model would scale up for a nationwide Morrisons service with different customer needs. \"I don't know how parallel the UK is to the New York market. It's an incredibly expensive business to get right; you have to have building density,\" she says. Fresh Direct heavily markets more than 600 ready-made dishes, such as banana-leaf wrapped salmon and sea salt edamame. This marries with the Morrisons Market Street concept \u2013 an aisle in each store comprising traditional food counters such as the deli, fishmonger and butchers. In the same vein, Fresh Direct's online customers can determine the thickness of their prime boneless NY strip steak to the half inch and the thinness of the cheese slice to go on top. \"The benefit of freshly prepared food is that it adds margin,\" Mulpuru says. \"You charge $10 for products that cost two to three dollars.\" Morrisons says: \"Our team learned a lot about the economics of picking and delivery of food. They also found a very strong focus on customers with products, systems and processes built around the customer. They were struck by the unshakeable focus on quality at Fresh Direct from the top to the bottom of the organisation. Issues with product quality are fixed and produce sales grow strongly as a result. Their reputation in the New York area is second to none and we have learned a lot about how they built that reputation.\" Fresh Direct's approach to customer service will be one of the biggest lessons for the Morrisons team, according to Anne Zybowski, a retail expert at global consultancy Kantar Retail. \"Fresh Direct has understood how to have that conversation through its website and delivery system,\" she says. \"They're always on time, product is fresh and any issues are dealt with quickly.\" She cites Fresh Direct's Amazon-style product rating system as an example of its attention to detail. Every morning its produce managers choose a rating for their fresh produce which is displayed on the website. If its apricots score four stars they will be ready to eat when they arrive the next day. If they are out of season, they might get one or two stars. \"It's completely transparent and drives customer trust,\" Zybowski says. Morrisons will divulge more details of an online service when it reveals its full-year results next month. Its typical shopper may not have a doorman, but may be able to expect US-style supercharged customer service.",

      "bodyText": "Time to stop. Here's a quick closing summary: \u2022 MEPs have threatened to veto the EU budget deal hammered out by leaders at the Summit 10 days ago. Several influential European politicians argued that the multiannual financial framework agreed by European leaders was unacceptable, despite Herman Van Rompuy (European Council president), insisting it was fair and reasonable (see 2.27pm for details, and 1.22pm onwards for full highlights). \u2022 Latvia is poised to apply for eurozone membership. The move, expected at the start of March, could help push euro membership up to 20 countries (see 5.08pm) \u2022 Mario Draghi warned MEPs that the euro economy remains weak. . The president of the European Central Bank said he saw tentative signs of recovery, but warned that weak exports, slow reforms or a 'geopolitical event' could knock the eurozone off course again. (see 2.26pm onwards). \u2022 Voters in Cyprus will head to the polls next weekend for a runoff vote to choose their next president. The ballot will probably determine whether, when, and how Cyprus becomes the next eurozone country to take an international bailout. (details from 8.28am, with photos of the voting here). \u2022 Nicos Anastasiades topped the first ballot in Cyprus yesterday with 45% of votes cast. Analysts believe he will win next weekend's head-to-head comfortably (see 11.41am), while George Lillikas. (who came third) has not yet said who he will support (see 10.30am). \u2022 Italy will also go to the polls next weekend. Analysts reckon the general election there is increasingly hard to call (see 11.02am onwards). \u2022 The pound hit a new seven-month low against the US dollar. The yen also slid after G20 finance ministers released a statement promising to avoid currency wars. Thanks all, and good night! Just in -- Latvia will make its formal application for eurozone membership in a few weeks. The move will pave the way to an 18th member of the single currency at the start of next year, as long as it hits the necessary targets. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports that Latvia's move could prompt Lithuania and Poland to follow. He writes: The prime minister of Latvia, Valdis Dombrovskis, said his government would formally apply to join the single currency at the beginning of next month and hope to become the 18th member by the end of the year. Officials in Riga are consulting with the European commission and the European Central Bank. \"It's just a technical issue now,\" Dombrovskis said. \"By July the whole procedure should be finished.\" The full story just been launched here. European stock markets have closed for the day, after a pretty uneventful session: FTSE 100: down 10 points at 6318, -0.16% German DAX: up 34 points at 7,628, + 0.46% French CAC: up 8 points at 3668, +0.2% Italian FTSE MIB: down 83 points at 16406, - 0.5% Spanish IBEX: down 41 points at 8108, -0.5% Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says it was a 'lethargic' start to the week (partly because Wall Street is closed for the President's Day public holiday): A quiet morning has given traders more time to assess the comments following the latest G20 conference held this weekend in Moscow. The anticipated dressing down of Japan and its currency devaluing policies, plus the often quoted 'currency war' failed to materialise, with IMF head Christine Lagarde confirming that it does not exist. ECB president Mario Draghi was optimistic about the state of the eurozone as expected this afternoon, outlining his expectations that the inflation rate would drop below 2% in the near future. From Spain, our correspondent Giles Tremlett flags up the latest signs of the personal impact of the Spanish economic downturn, as more people lose their homes. Are Spanish banks driving people to suicide? That is the uncomfortable conclusion that some Spaniards have reached following a spate of suicides amongst those waiting to have their homes foreclosed after failing to pay their mortgages. Last week three people ,including an elderly couple, were reported to have killed themselves for this reason. That may explain why the ruling People's party did a U-turn on its decision to throw out a public petition, signed by more than half a million people, for a raft of measures to prevent foreclosures to be introduced. It has yet to be seen, however, which aspects of the petition it will finally accept. Today a woman has set fire to herself in a bank in Almassora, eastern Spain. She has been rushed to hospital, according to local press reports. (links are in Spanish) There have been dramatic scenes in Spain today as a five-day strike by workers at the Iberia airline got under way. Strikers scuffled with police at Madrid's Barajas airport, where demonstrators held a sit-in to protest against plans for compulsory layoffs and salary cuts. There were also protests in Barcelona and Malaga. Many workers blamed British Airways, which merged with Iberia two years ago. Here are some photos from Spain: The euro weakened a little during Mario Draghi's testimony, down from $1.3359 to $1.3335. The ECB president also told MEPs that monetary policy would remain \"accomodative\", but cautioned that a long period of low interest rates could fuel asset bubbles. Draghi went on to warn the committee that the threat to the eurozone economy remain to the downside. He cites three threats 1) That Eurozone exports might be weaker than expected 2) the government's might not implement structural reforms as quickly as hoped 3) Geopolitical issues, that will harm Europe's ability to recover and could hit commodity prices (a new conflict in the Middle East would fall into this category) Mario Draghi touched on the issue of the euro's recent rally, saying: The exchange rate is not a policy target, but is important for growth and price stability. So the ECB is not engaging in any currency war, but has an eye on the issue.... ECB president Mario Draghi begins his appearance at the European Parliament's committee on economic and monetary affairs by telling MEPs that Europe \"entered 2013 in a more stable financial environment than in recent years\". He warns, though that the eurozone economy is still weak after shrinking for the last three quarter, and will only recover slowly this year. We have yet to see significant improvement in the real economy, Draghi adds, but he is encouraged by some signs of optimism in recent surveys. It's a busy day at the European Parliament - Mario Draghi just arrived at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. It's being streamed live here. Some MEPs are giving Herman Van Rompuy a tough time over the new EU budget, and threatening to block the deal. Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian PM who leads the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) group, criticised the gap between spending plans and payments. This means Europe's total unpaid commitments will swell to \u20ac300bn, he claimed. Verhofstadt insisted that the multiannual financial framework must be renegotiated, adding: This is not an MFF that the parliament can accept. Hannes Swoboda, who leads the Socialist &amp; Democrats Group, also said the agreement was unacceptable, and would not be approved by MEPs. However, Britain's Martin Callanan, who chairs the European Conservatives and Reformists grouping, was more supportive of the budget hammered out after another Brussels all-nighter. He was most critical of the French: As Barroso reminds MEPs (not that they have forgotten!), the EU budget agreed by Angela Merkel, David Cameron and the other 25 EU leaders will only be implemented with the approval of the European Parliament. So this afternoon's debate (continuing here) could determine whether MEPs block the MFF. Jose Manuel Barroso is now addressing MEPs on the EU budget, and sounding rather less impressed than Van Rompuy. Barroso, president of the European Commission, points out that the budget for Connecting Europe is much lower than the Commission had wanted (infrastructure investment was slashed to \u20ac24bn, from the EC's target of \u20ac50bn). That rather undermines Van Rompuy's argument that this is a \"growth-friendly\" budget. Last week, telecoms firms warned that the cutbacks would hit the rollout of broadband networks in the UK (details here). Herman Van Rompuy is attempting to head off the threat of a revolt in the European Parliament over the seven-year budget agreed by EU leaders (which cuts spending for the first time in the EU's history). Van Rompuy is telling MEPs that the new budget shows \"a clear shift towards growth-friendly investment\" while also recognising that the EU must \"tighten belts\" in the current financial climate. The new deal is a good deal for Europe, he insisted, following a summit in which individual leaders had fought \"legitimately\" for their individual interests. He also told the Parliament that their concerns had been heeded \u2013 even though the budget, or Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), contains a large gap between spending plans (\u20ac960bn) and actual financial commitments from member states (\u20ac908.4bn). There is \"maximum flexibility\" to ensure funding for projects, Van Rompuy promised. Here are some more key points (via HVR's team): Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, is presenting the new seven-year EU budget (agreed 10 days ago) to the European Parliament. There's a live-stream here. Highlights to follow. Ewald Nowotny, Austria's central bank governor and member of the European Central Bank's governing council, is in upbeat mood today. Speaking in Vienna a little while ago, Nowotny declared that the eurozone economy will hit its low-point in the current quarter before rebounding from recession, saying: We believe that the bottom will be reached in the first quarter of this year, that is the first quarter of 2013, and then there will exist a slow upwards development. Nowotny also added his voice to those insisting that a currency war is not taking place, calling such chatter \"absolutely unnecessary\". According to Reuters, Nowotny also declared that the eurozone crisis was \"over for the financial markets\", but not yet for the real economy. A rare piece of good news from Ireland \u2013 Facebook has recruited an extra 100 staff for its international headquarters in Dublin. This brings the numbers working for the social network giant in Ireland to 500. Our man in Dublin, Henry McDonald, explains: It is also a further boost to Dublin's south inner city which has been labelled \"the Google Quarter\" given the concentration of global Internet companies in the area including the world's biggest search engine. The new jobs underline Ireland's reputation as a major international base for Internet based businesses. Announcing the new posts in the Irish capital today, the Republic's Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton said: \"ICT is a key sector targeted in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs. \"We are determined to build on the major successes in this sector in recent years, in particular by supporting the further development of the thriving cluster around Dublin's docklands. \"Today's announcement of a significant expansion by one of the biggest companies on the internet, with the creation of 100 high-end jobs, is a major endorsement of the tech environment in Dublin and further confirmation of our city's status as the internet capital of Europe.\" These new appointments however have to be placed in the context of Ireland's overall unemployment rate which remains at 14.6% - almost five percentage points higher than the EU average, Henry adds. Germany's Bundesbank has predicted that the German economy will return to growth this quarter, and 'pick up pace' through 2013. In its latest monthly report, the German central bank indicated that the 0.6% drop in GDP in the final three months of last year will soon be clawed back: There are signs that economic activity will gradually pick up pace in the remainder of the year, although the external environment should not be expected to kick-start a very strong surge in demand. More here. Here's some comment on the Cyprus presidential election, from Robert O\u2019Daly, European analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. O\u2019Daly reckons Nicos Anastasiades will win next weekend's second round vote comfortably. But then the hard work starts.... Once the election is out of the way, Mr Anastasiades' main focus will be on finalising a much-needed bail-out agreement with the EU/IMF, which Cyprus applied for in late June 2012. Any further delays will leave Cyprus uncomfortably close to the \u20ac1.4bn international bond repayment due on June 3rd. The government is currently relying on unorthodox sources of funding, such as borrowing from the pension funds of semi-government organisations, to meet its regular financing needs. It is unlikely that euro zone leaders would allow Cyprus to default because of the risk of contagion to other distressed peripheral countries, but the timing will be tight. Italian political expert Alberto Nardelli has also published his latest predictions on the general election - he reckons that Pier Luigi Bersani's Democratic Party should win the lower house of parliament by around 5%, and could sweep the Senate (upper house) too -- if support for the far-left really crumbles. He also predicts: \u2022 Monti will get less than 15% of votes \u2022 Beppe Grillo (of the Five Star Movement) will get more than 15% \u2022 The far-left seriously risks not hitting the 4% threshold required to enter parliament \u2022 The centre-left is within touching distance of winning in Lombardy, and consequently having a majority in the senate too. Bersani\u2019s coalition is on course to win 145-168 seats (majority is 158). Lombardy, along with Veneto, Sicily and Campania, holds the key to the Senate race -- they're the four swing states. Under Italian voting rules the winner in each region picks up 55% of the seats on offer, with the other parties sharing the rest. If the far-left does falter, Bersani should pick up some of their support. And Grillo's popularity means fewer seats for the other parties who fail to win a region -- which could benefit Bersani if he wins those swing states, but harm him where he doesn't. Just a week to go until we know the results of Italy's general election, and speculation about the result is raging. Open Europe have published a new analysis paper, which argues that a centre-left coalition is the most likely. A Silvio Berlusconi win \u2013 a remarkable thought a few months ago \u2013 can't be ruled out (he was just 4% behind in the final opinion poll of the campaign). Open Europe's Vincenzo Scarpetta commented that the final outcome is increasingly hard to call: The uncertainty involved in the Italian elections, and the number of parties explicitly campaigning on an anti-austerity ticket, show just how challenging it will be for the eurozone to stick to its cash-for-discipline blueprint, as the hawkish North continues to clash with the austerity-fatigued South.\u201d \u201cThe Italian political scene will likely remain fragmented. Ironically, for those who want to see the continuation of Monti-style reforms, a hung Senate with Mario Monti as the kingmaker could be the best outcome, but even so, any government would be up against a strong anti-austerity opposition \u2013 with Beppe Grillo as the anti-establishment voice \u2013 and strong vested interests. The centre-left Democratic Party, led by Pier Luigi Bersani, still looks likely to win the most seats -- but could well fail to gain control of the Senate. That could lead to an alliance with the new party of the current prime minister, Mario Monti. And either man could end up as PM..... Here's a handy box outlining the options. The full paper can be downloaded here (pdf). The result of Cyprus's presidential election next weekend could be determined by the candidate who came third in yesterday's poll - George Lillikas. Lillikas, who won almost a quarter of votes cast, is the candidate most opposed to a bailout on the terms currently on the table. During the campaign he pledged to renegotiate the proposed package, if elected, arguing that the conditions that would be imposed by the IMF were undemocratic. Liilikas commented: Cyprus should not be economically dependent on anyone, because states which have an economic dependence have a political dependence too. Lillikas has also argued that Cyprus's financial problems are less serious than they appear \u2013 pointing to the huge reserves of gas recently discovered under its coastal waters. By one estimate there's $400bn of hydrocarbons waiting to be tapped. So far, Lillikas hasn't revealed whether he'll advise his supporters to vote for Nicos Anastasiades or Stavros Malas. Last night he promised to \"reach out\" to both sides to push his policies -- and reiterated that Cyprus must not surrender its sovereignty: We will support policies which defend the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus, and every policy which defends our national interests and is resistant to the will of foreigners. Here's a video clip of George Osborne, UK chancellor, insisting that last weekend's meeting of G20 finance ministers in Moscow was valuable: Osborne argued that the G20 are committed to avoiding a currency war... What you're seeing at the moment for example on currencies is a determination for us to come together around common language to make it very clear that we won't be using currencies for competitive devaluations. Osborne added: I think it's a very clear signal from the largest economies in the world that they not going to engage in the kind of things that caused problems for the world economy in the past, when we didn't have G20 meetings. Back to currencies... and the yen has fallen by another 0.5% this morning to a new near-four-month low against the US dollar. This comes after G20 finance ministers pledged to avoid a currency war, by declaring: We will refrain from competitive devaluation. We will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. That's been seen as a green light for Japan to continue with its new drive for growth through aggressive monetary policy and more flexible government spending. Prime minister Shinzo Abe's new policy (dubbed Abenomics) has already driven the yen down steadily - clearly the G20 aren't going to thwart him. But with unorthodox monetary policy the new normal, can we really believe that world leaders (who made similar comments last week) and finance chiefs remain committed to a fair fight? Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, for one, isn't convinced: The G20's leaders approve of policies to boost growth, while disapproving of policies to boost growth at the expensive of others. They'd like the kind of 'war' where no-one gets hurt. As the chidren say \"whatever\"! So while currency manipulation is bad, zero rates and QE are good. And if those policies happen to cause a currency to weaken, well that's OK. All too complicated for me, I'll stay short yen as well as CHF [the Swiss franc] and GBP [sterling]. A few more pictures from Cyprus: Elsewhere in town.... And the traditional ballot-box shot: Not a great morning for sterling -- the pound has slid to a new seven-month low against the US dollar this morning, down another 0.4% to $1.545. The weak UK economy, predictions of more quantitative easing and jitters over Britain's AAA rating have knocked 5% off the value of the pound this year. This latest sell-off appears to be caused by Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale, who declared on Saturday that a weaker currency was a natural way to fix Britain's current account deficit, so the BoE should ignore the inflationary impact of weaker sterling (details here) The Cypriot election results show that Nicos Anastasiades hasn't, yet, persuaded the people that they must follow Greece, Ireland and Portugal into an IMF-led bailout. And that could worry the rest of the eurozone. As Fiona Mullen, an economist at the Sapienta consulting firm, put it (via Reuters): This result means that Cypriots have not quite decided if Anastasiades is the man to get them out of the crisis. It will be a tough second round It makes it a bit tougher for Anastasiades to persuade EU leaders that Cyprus is on the right path, that they will do what it takes to get a bailout. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest economic and political developments across the eurozone, and beyond.... Politics is centre-stage this morning, with crucial elections due in Cyprus and Italy next weekend. Last night, the Cypriot presidential election failed to deliver a winner as pro and anti-bailout candidates split the vote. The voting round was won by conservative candidate Nicos Anastasiades, who argued through the campaign that Cyprus must sign up for an aid programme from international lenders. More than 45% of voters concluded that they agreed with Nicos. But the 66-year old leader of the Democratic Rally party was denied a straight victory by two candidates who together won over 50% of the vote. Left-wing Stavros Malas (26.9%) and independent candidate George Lillikas (24.9%) both won significant support after arguing against signing up a tough austerity package in return for bailout help. While Anastasiades is expected to win next Saturday's head-to-head tussle with Malas, his failure to romp to victory last night proves that Cyprus remains divided over its future, some eight months after talks began with the International Monetary Fund over a possible loan deal. The talks had stalled because Cyprus's outgoing communist president, Demetris Christofias, refused to agree the IMF's demands, such as sweeping state asset sales. As my colleague Helena Smith wrote last night, Anastasiades is the favoured candidate among the European establishment: Brussels had not hidden its hope that Anastasiades would win. An advocate of neo-liberal policies who believes in breaking the power of trade unions, the 66-year-old lawyer has promised to reach a speedy agreement with would-be creditors at the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank. \"Above all else, we must unite forces to counter this economic crisis which unfortunately our homeland has never experienced before,\" he said after casting his ballot. Cyprus's financial crisis was caused, in part, by the heavy losses its banks suffered on their Greek debt holdings. The proposed bailout would be around \u20ac17bn, much smaller than previous eurozone rescue packages. But the lack of a deal continues to cause concern in the financial markets. ECB board member Jorg Asmussen says he's hopeful of an agreement by the end of March - assuming the next president is more amenable to selling off the family silver.... I'll be tracking reaction to the Cyprus election through the day, along with the latest twists in Italy as its general election campaign enters its last week. There's also fallout from last weekend's meeting of G20 finance ministers -- where the world's leading nations issued a pledge to avoid a currency war. Not everyone is convinced...",

Matthews has recently been joined on the board of Heathrow by Akbar al-Baker, the outspoken chief executive of Qatar Airways, after the state's sovereign wealth fund took a 20% stake in the airport. Matthews said that al-Baker had not yet attended a board meeting, but was just one voice of many who supported the demand for greater hub capacity in the UK. Despite the capacity crunch, the Heathrow boss said he did not hold with calls made last week to bring forward the verdict of the Davies Commission to before the election. \"My view is that whatever decision is taken has to stick. The last two decisions have been promptly undone. That does no good whatsoever to the country. If in order to win broad enough political support that takes until 2015, then I'd rather that than have a decision in 2013-14 which is undone at the next election, because that is just wasteful.\"",
