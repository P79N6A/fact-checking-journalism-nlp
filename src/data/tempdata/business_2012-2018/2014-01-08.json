That all is not well has been highlighted by the feverishness the \u201cpolitical escape\u201d of one of Greece\u2019s top terrorists, the November 17 member Christos Xeros, has also stoked. In private, officials all day have been voicing embarrassment that Xeros, who was serving six life sentences, should manage to slip the authorities (while enjoying an officially condoned visit to his parents in northern Greece) at the start of the presidency. His disappearance prompted the former foreign minister Dora Bakoyannis to declare this morning that the country \u201cin all likelihood\u201d is now headed towards a major terrorist incident. </p> <p>If that were not enough Kostas Simitis, the socialist former prime minister, has also raised the political thermometer by pronouncing that despite the sacrifices made by a nation now suffering record levels of poverty and unemployment, Athens\u2019 continued membership of the euro zone is still far from assured when it has a debt load that is no where near becoming sustainable. Simitis, who made the point in what insiders are calling \u201can appallingly timed\u201d op-ed piece over the weekend, ironically oversaw Greece\u2019s transition into the single currency. He is also the man who first foresaw that Greece would have to be rescued by the IMF. Both incidents have cast a pall over the fiesta the government will hold tonight when EU commissioners enjoy a gala evening in Athens.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p>And that's where we'll leave it for tonight.

Since September's 12.2 percent rate was revised down, 12.1 percent is now the record.</p> <p>The agency also said retail sales during the month spiked by 1.4 percent, way ahead of predictions in the markets for a more modest increase of around 0.3 percent. The rise was the biggest since November 2011.<br> Though much of the increase was due to a 2.1 percent rise in France, where consumers may have brought forward purchases ahead of a sales tax rise, analysts said the figures suggest households are increasingly confident that the financial crisis is past its worst and that the recovery has legs.</p> <p>The increase followed two monthly declines and was fairly broad-based across the eurozone. The Iberian economies of Spain and Portugal did particularly well, posting gains of 1.9 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.</p> <p>\"The outlook is starting to brighten a little for eurozone consumers,\" said James Howat, European economist at Capital Economics.</p> <p>Despite the signs of improvement, the eurozone continues to face huge problems and most economists think it will remain the laggard of the world economy.</p> <p>Among the challenges will be to get unemployment down and prevent deflation, a sustained fall in prices that can encourage consumers to put off purchases in the hope of getting better bargains further down the line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2dd2970d-a166-44f5-9783-d9e8dfe9c2ce\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/8/1389183127011/ce2dad1d-559f-4d29-9327-df2c2b3f0550-460x314.png\" alt=\"EU unemployment rate\" width=\"460\" height=\"314\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Eurostat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wednesday's figures highlighted disparities across the eurozone, which had 17 members in November the bloc grew to 18 members following Latvia's adoption of Europe's single currency at the start of the year.</p> <p>While countries like Germany and Austria have unemployment rates around 5 percent, those at the forefront of Europe's debt crisis, such as Greece and Spain, have over one in four of their people out of work.</p> <p>The situation among the young there is even worse, though Greece appears to be showing some improvement on that front, with 54.8 percent of those aged 15-24 out of work at last count in September, compared with 57.7 percent the previous month.</p> <p>Policymakers are hoping the eurozone's return to economic growth may get unemployment down.

      "bodyText": "Over to our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith who reports that police have just used tear gas to stop protests in the heart of the capital (see also earlier). She writes: Behind all the back-slapping festivities of today\u2019s events there is a very different reality stalking Greece \u2013 and the first rounds of tear gas fired to stop left-wing protestors gathering outside the old university buildings in central Athens to great degree symbolises the fear that reality has caused. Riot police brutally broke up the gathering, refusing to allow members of the ANTARSYA group to even hold a press conference to denounce what it described as the EU\u2019s \u201cbarbaric\u201d economic policies. One of its members, the well-known school teacher, Pavlos Antonopoulos, was dragged away in handcuffs prompting the far-left organization to vow that \u201cthe government\u2019s violence will not stop anti-EU, anti-government protests.\u201d Greece\u2019s main opposition Syriza party also decried the use of force saying it ran contra to the image a country should strive to have when \u201cit respects the constitutionally established rights of its citizens.\u201d Throughout the day Athens has been in total lock-down with protests and gatherings prohibited from as far away as the airport to the city centre \u2013 a reflection of the government\u2019s desire to ensure the EU commissioners\u2019 24-hour Athenian sojourn goes smoothly when passions among the capital\u2019s increasingly desperate populace have reached boiling point. Almost five months after Greek authorities applied similar measures when the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, also visited the capital, it is clear that official angst over each and every EU event is mounting: no dignitary can now visit Athens without draconian protection and the notion of democracy somehow being flouted. That all is not well has been highlighted by the feverishness the \u201cpolitical escape\u201d of one of Greece\u2019s top terrorists, the November 17 member Christos Xeros, has also stoked. In private, officials all day have been voicing embarrassment that Xeros, who was serving six life sentences, should manage to slip the authorities (while enjoying an officially condoned visit to his parents in northern Greece) at the start of the presidency. His disappearance prompted the former foreign minister Dora Bakoyannis to declare this morning that the country \u201cin all likelihood\u201d is now headed towards a major terrorist incident. If that were not enough Kostas Simitis, the socialist former prime minister, has also raised the political thermometer by pronouncing that despite the sacrifices made by a nation now suffering record levels of poverty and unemployment, Athens\u2019 continued membership of the euro zone is still far from assured when it has a debt load that is no where near becoming sustainable. Simitis, who made the point in what insiders are calling \u201can appallingly timed\u201d op-ed piece over the weekend, ironically oversaw Greece\u2019s transition into the single currency. He is also the man who first foresaw that Greece would have to be rescued by the IMF. Both incidents have cast a pall over the fiesta the government will hold tonight when EU commissioners enjoy a gala evening in Athens. And that's where we'll leave it for tonight. Thanks for your comments and we'll be back tomorrow for the reaction to the release of the US Federal Reserve's latest minutes, as well as the meetings of the Bank of England and European Central Bank and trading updates from a host of retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco. Investors were in cautious mood following the eurozone jobless figures and the better than expected US ADP jobs data. It was back to the good news is bad news syndrome again as far as the US is concerned, with the positive data seen as encouraging the US Federal Reserve to trim its $75bn a month bond buying programme again after last month's $10bn cut. So: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 33.67 points or 0.5% lower at 6721.78 \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.25% at 9482.39 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.27% lower at 4251.14 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended down 0.17% at 19,436.3 \u2022 But Spain's Ibex bucked the trend, adding 0.74% to 10,253.6 Ahead of the latest Federal Reserve minutes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.35% or 57 points lower. Missed this earlier --the US Treasury secretary has renewed the pressure on Germany to do more to help its neighbours by stimulating its domestic economy. On a visit to Europe, Jack Lew told a press conference in Berlin that Washington believes more internal demand within Germany would be good news for the whole region. Lew told a press conference, following a meeting with German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, that: We continue to believe that policies that would promote more domestic investment and demand would be good for the German economy and the global economy. Schauble, though, denied that Germany's export strength is a threat. Indeed, we should be more grateful for it, he suggests: \"The eurozone as a whole has a very small surplus .... and without the German surplus toward third countries, the eurozone would have no surplus at all, but a deficit. The American deficit won't be improved by a European one being added to it.\" Ouch... While Barroso and Samaras were addressing the press, there have been some protests in Athens. One man reportedly detained by police, as protests had been banned in parts of the capital. University lecturer Spyros Gkelis tweets a few photos. Those who talked of a Greek exit from the eurozone made the crisis worse, Barroso says. And those who now say Greece cannot cope wit the EU presidency are guilty of anti-European thing. All EU countries can do whatever's needed, he claims. And that's all -- sounds like Samaras will give another press conference later. Barroso then reminisces about previous Greek EU presidencies (this is the sixth one ever, and the third Barroso has been involved with). They went well, so those who doubt Greece now are judging it unfairly. I don't like stereotypes or prejudices. Another question - what message do Samaras and Barroso have to those who remain critical of Greece? Samaras replies that Greece is now close to a primary budget surplus, something that looked very difficult a year ago. We have made real progress in structural reforms (he claims). Some early reaction: Onto questions, and the Financial Times's Peter Spiegel asks the first one, about the risk of political instability in 2014. European elections are coming this May, and opinion polls suggest that the opposition Syriza party will do well, while coalition partner Pasok will do badly, he says.... At which point my web feed crashed.... ... and when it comes back Samaras is criticising Syriza as anti-European, and saying he's confidence that Greeks will vote for a better future when the time comes. Barroso then speaks, saying that elections should not be a problem. One hundred years, Europeans were fighting each other all over the continent. Today they are preparing to vote in free elections. I have no doubts that the pro-European forces will win in this year's elections, he adds. I see no danger of instability in Europe, Barroso adds. Europe will remain fundamentally stable. He then agrees that rows between coalition parties, and other political instability, has flared up in Europe in recent years and generally been bad for market confidence. Politicians should show a sense of responsibility, as voters don't want their countries to suffer. The Commission stood by Greece \"always\" through the crisis, Barroso declares. A reminder that the press conference is being streamed here. Jose Manuel Barroso says he's fully aware that the man and woman on the street may not immediately feel the nascent signs of economic recovery. I want to pay tribute to the courage and dignity of the Greek people - I encourage you not to give up.... Your efforts and sacrifices are opening a better future, he says. Barroso then gives Greeks a nudge to stick with their austerity programme, saying Ireland's bailout exit proves that financial programmes work if you implement them properly. The Greek presidency is very well prepared and I see a real determination in the Greek authorities to make it a success, says Barroso. The very fact that we are here in Athens today to celebrate the Greek presidency today is \"clear evidence\" that those who claimed the eurozone would break up were wrong., Barroso declares. The existential stage of the eurozone crisis is behind us, he says, predicting Greece will leave recession this year. Ireland has already exited its bailout, and Latvia has now joined the single currency. Now Barroso speaks, saying he believes 2014 will be a better year for Europe. Antonis Samaras thanks for Barroso for coming to Greece today, before reminding his audience that the last few years have been deeply painful. Greece has gone through unimaginable difficulties... [It has] suffered a loss of living standards not seen since the second world war. Antonis Samaras sums up Greece's presidential priorities as: More Europe, better, Europe, more cohesive Europe. After a long crisis, Greece is starting to stand on its feet again, he adds, and leaving the crisis behind. The Barroso-Samaras press conference is beginning in Athens now, and being streamed live here (with translation into English) Samaras says Greece hopes to use the EU presidency to strengthen its relation with the EU. Its priorities, therefore, are Economic recovery, fighting unemployment, and guaranteeing the social cohesion of the union, he says. We also need to strengthen Europe's democratic framework and reinforce the rights of citizens, Samaras adds. Heads-up: Greek PM Antonis Samaras and EC president Jose Manuel Barroso will give a press conference shortly in Athens, as Greece's EU presidency begins. Twitter's share price is sliding in early trading, down over 3% to $59.48, after Cantor Fitzgerald became the latest firm to downgrade the social media company. Cantor cut its rating on Twitter from hold to sell, with a price target of $32.00. Ding ding - Wall Street has just opened for business, and stocks are inching lower - mirroring the small falls in Europe today. \u2022 DOW JONES DOWN 25.24 POINTS, OR 0.15 PERCENT, AT 16,505.70 AFTER MARKET OPEN In the UK, energy firm Npower has become the final member of the Big Six to partly reverse its winter price rise. Having raised bills by 10.4% in late 2013, Npower is now reducing them by 2.6%. The move will knock \u00a350 off the average duel-fuel tariff, while electricity customers whose prices did not increase in December should get a \u00a312 rebate in the autumn. This comes after the UK government decided to move green levies off customer bills, and onto the general tax bill. Caroline Flint MP, Labour's Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary, says it isn't enough: Even after the Government's changes to green levies, people's energy bills will still be higher this winter than last. This is why nothing less than a price freeze and reforms to stop the energy companies overcharging again in the future will do. The Government boasts about the economic recovery, but soaring energy bills are one of the main reasons working people are \u00a31,600 a year worse off under David Cameron. America's building firms drove the jump in private sector jobs in December, creating a total of 48,000 new jobs in December, the most since 2006. The US goods-producing sector created 69,000 extra jobs, which was also an eight-year high. Manufacturing created 19,000, down from November's 23,000. The interest rate on US 10-year government bonds is inching closer to 3%.... The US dollar is strengthening on the back of the better-than-expected ADP jobs report, while the prices of US Treasury bonds are weakening. The dollar just hit a one-month high against the euro at $1.357. Wall Street is reckoning a stronger US labour market will give the Federal Reserve the green light to keep cutting back on its bond-buying programme, having voted in December to trim it from $85bn/month to $75bn/month. At 238,000, today's ADP report shows that more new private sector jobs were created in America in December than in any month since November 2012. Just in: A total of 238,000 new private sector jobs were created in America in December, according to the ADP monthly report. That's rather more than 200,000 new jobs that economists had expected, suggesting the US labour market ended 2013 in decent shape. An endorsement of the Federal Reserve's decision to start tapering its bond-buying programme? Jon Hilsenrath, the WSJ's man watching the Federal Reserve, reckons tonight's Fed minutes won't be a shock... It's been an unspectacular morning in Europe's stock markets, with the main indices down a little. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 20 points at 6735, a drop of 0.3% \u2022 German DAX: down 14 points at 9491, - 0.15% \u2022 French CAC: down 4 points at 4257, - 0.1% Insurance group RSA is the biggest riser in London, up 3.7%, after it told shareholders last night it believes its financial irregularities in Ireland are an isolated problem. David Madden of IG says traders are \"playing it safe\" while they wait for the US Federal Reserve to release its latest minutes, at 7pm UK time (2pm New York): Tonight's minutes will give us an insight into why the US central bank decided to trim its bond-buying scheme, and we are likely to see low volumes and volatility until then. Associated Press has rounded up this morning's European unemployment and retail sales data: Eurozone economy shows glimmers of hope Glimmers of hope emerged Wednesday for the eurozone economy to suggest that the coming year will see the recovery gathering steam. Official figures showed a stabilization in unemployment and the biggest increase in monthly retail sales in 12 years. Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, said the eurozone's unemployment rate held steady in November at a record 12.1 percent for the eighth month running after a modest 4,000 rise in the ranks of the jobless to 19.24 million. Since September's 12.2 percent rate was revised down, 12.1 percent is now the record. The agency also said retail sales during the month spiked by 1.4 percent, way ahead of predictions in the markets for a more modest increase of around 0.3 percent. The rise was the biggest since November 2011. Though much of the increase was due to a 2.1 percent rise in France, where consumers may have brought forward purchases ahead of a sales tax rise, analysts said the figures suggest households are increasingly confident that the financial crisis is past its worst and that the recovery has legs. The increase followed two monthly declines and was fairly broad-based across the eurozone. The Iberian economies of Spain and Portugal did particularly well, posting gains of 1.9 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively. \"The outlook is starting to brighten a little for eurozone consumers,\" said James Howat, European economist at Capital Economics. Despite the signs of improvement, the eurozone continues to face huge problems and most economists think it will remain the laggard of the world economy. Among the challenges will be to get unemployment down and prevent deflation, a sustained fall in prices that can encourage consumers to put off purchases in the hope of getting better bargains further down the line. Wednesday's figures highlighted disparities across the eurozone, which had 17 members in November the bloc grew to 18 members following Latvia's adoption of Europe's single currency at the start of the year. While countries like Germany and Austria have unemployment rates around 5 percent, those at the forefront of Europe's debt crisis, such as Greece and Spain, have over one in four of their people out of work. The situation among the young there is even worse, though Greece appears to be showing some improvement on that front, with 54.8 percent of those aged 15-24 out of work at last count in September, compared with 57.7 percent the previous month. Policymakers are hoping the eurozone's return to economic growth may get unemployment down. So far, the eurozone's recovery from its longest-ever though not deepest recession has been paltry but most economists are predicting a modest pick up this year, with even Greece emerging from a six-year depression that has seen its overall economic output shrink by over a fifth. Because it takes a few months for changes in economic growth to affect the labor market, and as many governments continue to make spending cuts to get public finances into shape, most economists think it will be some time before there's a real drop in unemployment. \"It is good news that labor shedding has receded so that the number of unemployed is no longer rising, or at least not by much,\" said Marie Diron, a senior economist adviser at EY, formerly Ernst &amp; Young. \"But we think that it will be a long while before we see a fall in unemployment.\" AP A newsflash for fans of popular music, and tequila: 08-Jan-2014 12:00 - SEAN \"DIDDY\" COMBS AND DIAGEO ANNOUNCE NEW JOINT VENTURE AND ACQUISITION OF LUXURY TEQUILA BRAND DELEON Update: More details here Back in Athens, the country's leading opposition figure has reportedly decined to attend today's ceremony to mark Greece's EU presidency. Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras is boycotting the event, given he doesn't agree with Europe's policy of forcing deep austerity on countries who are trying to escape the debt crisis. But his absence is also due to a blazing political row that blew up with the governing New Democracy party, after Syriza was accused of associating with members of a terror group. Kathimerini has the story: A day after police launched a manhunt for a convicted member of the disbanded November 17 guerrilla organization who failed to report to police.... conservative New Democracy, which leads the ruling coalition, accused the leftist opposition SYRIZA of having \u201cwell-known links to terrorism,\u201d sparking a furious response from SYRIZA. No respite for Mothercare, either - its shares are down 27% after this morning's profit warning. Back in the stock markets, Sainsbury's early rally has turned sour - its shares are now down 2%, making it one of the biggest fallers. The City has lost interest in its better-than-expected Christmas sales (up 0.2%) and focused on Justin King's warning that sales growth this year will miss forecasts (as flagged up on this morning's conference call). Jonathan Jackson, head of equities at Killik &amp; Co, points to Sainsbury's caution about 2014. The group expects the challenging economic backdrop to persist, with customers spending cautiously in the few months following Christmas, in an attempt to rebalance household finances. Eurocrats and Greek politicians are gathered in Athens for the official event to begin its EU presidency, with Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso flying in this morning. Over in Ireland, there is some good news from the food and drink sector -- which suffered badly from country's economic battering. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: The value of food and drink exports has approached \u20ac10bn for the first time according to figures from the end of 2013. Irish exports of its produce are up by 9% on the previous year and 40% over the last four years, Bord Bia, the country's food marketing board said today. Dairy exports with products like Irish butter were worth more than \u20ac3 billion alone last year, Bord Bia said. And the UK remains the key market for Ireland's beef, butter, milk and other food sectors with 42% of the Republic's exports destined for the British market. The UK is still the biggest market as well for Irish drinks with an increase in the sale of Irish whiskey and mineral water to Britain over the last 12 months. Bord Bia said among the emerging nations food and drink exports to China have increased by more than 40% over the last year three years. Europe's biggest economy continues to shrug off the eurozone unemployment crisis, with German factories reporting a 2.1% rise in new orders in November. That beats City estimates, and was driven by a rise in foreign demand (up 2.2%) and domestic orders (up 1.9%). It means German factories have recovered from a quieter October ,when orders fell by 2.1%. Eurozone unemployment will remain close to these record levels for some time, warns Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He writes: While signs of stabilizing labour markets is relatively encouraging, unemployment remains worryingly high across the Eurozone and it seems unlikely to come down markedly any time soon. Although the Eurozone has been growing slightly since the second quarter of 2013, economic activity will likely remain too limited in the near term at least to generate many jobs. Furthermore, while business confidence across the Eurozone has generally improved appreciably in recent months, many firms remain wary of the outlook. Firms are also aware of how difficult and costly it can still be to shed labor in some countries which can deter taking on new workers. Unemployment among Europe's youth remains at historic highs, as young people continue to be hurt badly by the economic crisis. Eureostat reports that 5.661 million people under the age of 25 were unemployed in the EU28 in November, including 3.575 million in the euro area. That put the youth unemployment rate at 23.6% in the European Union, and 24.2% in the euro area, up from 23.4% and 23.9% a year ago And again, there are alarming difference between the northern core and the weaker countries in the south. Eurostat reports: In November 2013, the lowest rates were observed in Germany (7.5%) and Austria (8.6%), and the highest in Spain (57.7%), Greece (54.8% in September 2013) and Croatia (49.7% in the third quarter of 2013). Last summer, EU leaders made a lot of noise about a \u20ac6bn package to fight youth unemployment. Today's data shows the problem is as acute as ever, risking all manner of long-term social and economic problems in the future. No wonder young people have been at the front line of many of the anti-austerity protests in Europe in recent months, particularly in Spain: This chart (a larger version is here) shows the big differences between unemployment rates in Austria (4.8%, on the left) and Spain (27.4%, on the right). The latest eurozone retail sales suggests a recovery in consumer spending-- they bounced by 1.4% in November after a 0.4% drop in October. It's the biggest monthly increase since November 2001. It's disappointing that there's no signs of improvement in the eurozone jobless rate, given the region exited its recession in the second quarter of 2013. The BBC's Gavin Hewitt tweets: As usual, the headline eurozone unemployment rate of 12.1% hides stark differences between its member states. The highest rate for November was recorded in Spain, at an eye-watering 26.7%. New data for Greece isn't available, but its jobless rate was an even more alarming 27.4% in September. But in Austria, the rate was just 4.8%, according to Eurostat's calculations. Today's data also shows that unemployment has risen in fourteen eurozone members over the last year, and fallen in fourteen. And the biggest jumps were mainly seen in countries where tough austerity measures are being implemented: The highest increases were registered in Cyprus (13.3% to 17.3%), Italy (11.3% to 12.7%), Greece (26.0% to 27.4% between September 2012 and September 2013) and the Netherlands (5.6% to 6.9%). Eurostat's data shows that 19.241 million men and women are out of work in the eurozone, a total that rises to 26.533m if you add the other members of the European Union. One tiny piece of good news in today's data is that Eurostat has revised down its previous estimate that the eurozone jobless rate hit 12.2% in September. There has been no improvement in jobless rates across Europe since last spring, according to today's data from Eurostat. It reports that the eurozone unemployment rate has been \"stable\" since April, at a record high of 12.1%. Across the EU, it has been unchanged since May at 10.9%, according to this morning's data. Breaking: the eurozone unemployment rate was unchanged in November, at 12.1%. Greek government ministers are holding press conferences to mark its six-month stint holding the EU presidency. Deputy prime minister, Evangelis Venizelos, has denied that Greece can't cope with the extra responsibility, and denied that further debt relief will be needed. The FT's Peter Spiegel and the WSJ's Matina Stevis have tweeted the key points from Athens: The rally in European peripheral government debt is continuing this morning, with investors keen to consign the eurozone crisis to history. This has driven down the interest rate on Greek 10-year bonds to its lowest level since May 2010, before its debt crisis kicked off. They're changing hands at yields of just 7.7% this morning, as this graph shows: As we reported in the blog yesterday, Ireland saw strong demand for its first post-bailout programme bond sale, in a sign of renewed confidence in the region. Today's jump in Italy's unemployment rate, to a record high of 12.7% in November, takes it further above the eurozone average (unless we get a very nasty surprise at 10am) as this graph from Markit shows: Italy's jobless crisis has deepened, with its jobless rate soaring to a new record high. The youth unemployment rate has also hit new record levels. ISTAT reports that the headline Italian jobless rate has hit 12.7% in November, up from 12.5% in October, in an unexpected blow to Rome's attempts to drag the economy back to growth. It's the highest reading since records began in 1977. The unemployment rate among young people climbed to 41.6%, from 41.4% the previous month. ISTAT also reported that the proportion of Italians in work slipped to 55.4%, with 36.4% of Italian adults classed as 'inactive'. A reminder that we get the overall unemployment data for the eurozone in just over 30 minutes... Analysts at City firm Numis have more than halved their forecasts for Mothercare's earnings, as they digest this morning's profit warning. Numis (who are Mothercare's house broker) now expect pre-tax profits of \u00a38m this financial year, down from \u00a317m. And for next year, they see a PBT of \u00a315m, down from \u00a333m. And here's a handy graph comparing the various surveys of UK house prices, to put today's Halifax data into context. Britain's resurgent housing market took an unexpected breather in the run-up to Christmas, according to fresh data this morning. Halifax has reported that the price of the average UK house fell by 0.6% in December, surprising economists who had expected a rise of 0.7%. It's the first month-on-month fall since last January. However, prices were still up by 1.9% in the last three months 2013, compared to the third quarter of the year, so the rally probably isn't over. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight warned: There is still a very real risk that a new housing bubble could really develop in 2014, especially as there is mounting evidence in latest surveys and data that the strength in house prices is becoming widespread. Here's Sean's news story on Sainsbury's results: Sainsbury's enjoyed busiest week ever in runup to Christmas Sainsbury's just held a conference call, where it told reporters that it will just miss its sales targets for the full financial year. My colleague Sean Farrell was on the call, and reports: That has hit Sainsbury's share price -- after that early jump, they're now down 1%. Chief executive Justin King also took a pop at rivals who are reporting results that only show trading for the last few weeks (such as Waitrose this morning) Mothercare's shares are being routed, tumbling almost 30% in early trading as investors throw their toys out of the pram. This morning's profit warning has raised new fears that its turnaround plan is struggling, total sales over the last 12 weeks plunging 6.1%. Mothercare wasn't due to report results until 16 January, but rushed them out today once it became clear that it wouldn't hit its profit targets. Mike Dennis of Cantor Fitzgerald has a sell rating on the company, and commented: The UK baby clothing and equipment market remains very competitive with few retailers in this category making any positive retail margins, especially as high street clothing chains, internet offers and supermarkets continue to grow space and share. The stock market is open, and shares in Sainsbury's have jumped almost 3% to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, gaining 10p to 379p. The City is welcoming the news that the chain managed to grow its comparable sales by 0.2% in the last quarter. Tesco's shares are up too, rising 1.5% -- perhaps investors reckon it also enjoyed a late sales surge. We'll find out tomorrow.... Waitrose also says it enjoyed its best Christmas ever, with sales up 4.1% in the final 12 days of 2013. It recorded its busiest ever day on Monday 23 December, when it took \u00a351m, with (it says) \"an average of 22,000 items going through checkouts every minute\". But like Sainsbury's Justin King, Waitrose boss Mark Price says the sales surge came late. And it's not just th usual retail excuses (he insists): Every year retailers say that Christmas is late, but with some justification in 2013 as customers phased their shopping in line with the mid-week fall of the main festivities. For the five week period ending on Christmas Eve, like-for-like sales at Waitrose were up by 3.1%. Reuters is reporting that Britain's Co-operative retailer grew its like-for-like sales by 1% over the last 13 weeks (a time that was dominated by the crisis at Co-op Bank). Despite the tough times, Majestic Wine managed to grow its sales again. The drinks retailer reported that like-for-like sales rose 2.8% in the last 10 weeks. Sainsbury's decent-looking results pile more pressure on Tesco, which reports its own results tomorrow. Josh Raymond of City Index said Tesco is already under \"significant pressure\" from its shareholders, having reported disappointing sales numbers earlier in 2013: The market is expecting Tesco to report a like for like sales decline of 1.5% when they report at 7am on Thursday. With Sainsburys reporting slightly better numbers than forecast and indeed another quarterly profit growth, Tesco really needs to deliver. Sainsbury's also reports that the seven days prior to Christmas was its busiest ever trading week, with more than 28 million transactions. That suggests shoppers also kept their hands off their wallets until the last minute. Monday 23rd December was the busiest day and saw our biggest trading hour, with customers spending nearly \u00a317 million. Customers also gobbled up more than 100,000 Taste the Difference fresh turkeys and turkey crowns, nearly half of which were Sainsbury's Norfolk Blacks. Skimming Sainsbury's results, it's clear that many customers used their loyalty cards to soften the blow of the Christmas bill. \u00a3120m worth of Nectar points were redeemed in the run-up to Christmas, up 9%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. A clutch of British retailers are reporting results for the crucial Christmas period - with Sainsbury's defying some gloomy predictions and Mothercare hitting shareholders with another profits warning. Sainsbury's is claiming its \"best Christmas ever\" after reporting like-for-like sales growth of 0.2% for the last 14 weeks (if you strip out fuel). That's not a stellar performance, but one achieved despite competition from budget supermarkets and the squeeze on living standards. Here's the key points from Sainsbury's: Total sales for third quarter up 2.5 per cent (2.7 per cent excluding fuel) Like-for-like sales for third quarter flat (0.2 per cent excluding fuel) 28 million customer transactions in the seven day run up to Christmas Strong sales growth in Taste the Difference over the Christmas period CEO Justin King said October and November had been pretty tough for supermarkets, as UK shoppers saved up to give their families a treat over Christmas.... However, we saw strong sales in the key period over Christmas, helping record numbers of customers to Live Well for Less. Like-for-like sales excluding fuel of 0.2 per cent, coupled with a strong contribution from new space, led to our best Christmas ever. King also warned that the public will now be cutting back: As with last year, we expect customers to spend cautiously in the few months following Christmas, in an attempt to rebalance the household finances. The general economic backdrop remains uncertain for many families... Over at Mothercare, though, it's a darker picture as the mother and baby retailer warns that its profits will miss markets expectations (again....) Like-for-like sales at Mothercare stores (stripping out the impact of its store closure programme) have tumbled 4.0% in the last 12 weeks - a crucial time for the retail sector. Total UK sales have slumped almost 10%. Simon Calver, Mothercare CEO, blamed \"difficult\" trading conditions in the UK: In the UK, our stores suffered similar Christmas trading pressures to those reported elsewhere. Customer service scores continue to improve year on year but weaker footfall and higher promotional activity led to lower sales and margins. More details and reaction to follow, along with the results from Waitrose, Majestic Wine, Co-op, and Domino's Pizza. While in the eurozone, we get the latest unemployment data at 10am GMT -- which will show if there's any let-up in Europe's jobless crisis. And we'll be watching Greece, where its presidency of the EU kicks off in earnest today with a visit from Brussels officials and the accompanying press pack....",

      "bodyText": "Bentley had a record year in 2013, with a 19% rise in global sales despite diminishing demand in China and a shrinking luxury car market. The Crewe-based car manufacturer delivered 10,120 cars last year compared with 8,510 in 2012 and a touch above its previous peak of 10,014 in 2007. Growth was achieved as Bentley introduced its new Continental GT Speed Convertible and the Flying Spur and came despite an estimated 6% contraction in the luxury car market as a whole last year. Wolfgang Schreiber, Bentley's chairman and chief executive, said 2014 \"will surely not be an easy year,\" but added that demand for its new and existing models should underpin further growth. Bentley is part of Germany's Volkswagen group, and has the biggest share of the luxury car market, selling around one in four of all cars priced above \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3124,000). Bentley customers typically own seven or eight cars, and it is aiming to sell 15,000 cars in 2018. Sales in the UK, Bentley's third largest market after the US and China, were up by a quarter at 1,381 cars in 2013. In Europe sales rose 11% to 1,480 cars. Sales in the Americas were up 28% at 3,140, but sales were down 2.7% at 2,191 cars in China. Kevin Rose, sales and marketing director, said there were a number of reasons for the drop in China sales, where it has experience rapid growth in recent years. \"There are pure economic reasons because a lot of the export business in China has suffered in the last year and a half. \"Equally there has been a lot of investment in infrastructure, in particular in real estate, which has not proven to be so successful so there's a little bit less cash around. \"Philosophically, it's less acceptable to show wealth at the moment and people are a little bit nervous about that. That I think will probably change. There is also some migration of high-net worth individuals moving out of the market, all of whom would be potential Bentley customers.\" He said however that a high proportion of sales in places such as San Diego and Vancouver are made to Chinese nationals. Bentley is hoping that new products, including the rollout of its Flying Spur, will help stimulate the market in the world's second largest economy in 2014. \"I don't think we'll be helped much by the market,\" he added. The company is planning to invest around \u00a3800m and create 400 jobs in Crewe as it develops the first Bentley SUV, the first of which are expected to hit the roads in 2016. It is estimated a further 600 jobs will be created in the UK supply chain. A hybrid version of the SUV is likely to follow in 2017, Schreiber said.",

      "bodyText": "Bookstore chain Waterstones saw underlying sales fall \"a smudge\" below last year as its Kindle e-readers proved less tempting in the face of competition from iPads and other tablet computers. The 300-store chain, which is trying to revive its fortunes under the ownership of the Russian businessman Alexander Mamut, was also hit by the storms which swept the UK on what is usually its busiest day of the year, 23 December. \"We trade on the high street and only have a small presence online and footfall on the high street was a challenge in December,\" said the chief executive, James Daunt. \"But we were well set up to come through with a particularly good performance and then the major storm hit us so that was disappointing.\" He said the company had expected sales of the Kindle e-reader \u2013 which it offers shoppers as an alternative to physical books \u2013 had been hit by stronger competition compared with last year from a much broader range of alternatives, from Tesco's Hudl to Samsung's Galaxy. But Daunt said Waterstones, which slid \u00a337.3m into the red in 2012, had enjoyed a much more profitable Christmas than in 2012 as it had trimmed its costs while competition from the supermarkets had mellowed. The firm looks set to have grabbed a bigger share of the physical books market as the retailer's sales of paperbacks and hardbacks were up against a 6.5% fall recorded by Nielsen BookScan service. Daunt said Waterstones had been helped in some ways in 2013 by the lack of a book series popular with the masses such as Fifty Shades of Grey or the Harry Potter books, which were easier for supermarkets to promote. Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson's autobiography was Waterstone's biggest seller this Christmas, for example, but it was followed closely by Stoner \u2013 a book by John Williams first published in 1965 which became a surprise hit last year, selling 20,000 hardback copies in the store. Another success for Waterstones was its reserve and collect service which saw a 40% rise in sales. Daunt said he hoped to boost sales via this route further with an update to the retailer's website and mobile app later this year. But Daunt admitted that the company still had at least a year of heavy investment in stores, logistics and IT ahead of it before it could head back to profitability. \"We are fixing pretty much everything,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Mothercare shares plunged by 30% on Wednesday after the mums and baby store admitted Christmas trading had been hit by heavy discounting and poor toy sales. Mothercare was the biggest faller of all companies listed on the London Stock Exchange after the retailer revealed weak trading both at home and abroad. After the trading figures, Numis, one of Mothercare's house brokers, more than halved its expectations for the retailer's annual pre-tax profit to \u00a38m from an earlier forecast of \u00a317m. Sales in UK stores open a year or more fell 4% in the 12 weeks to 4 January and total UK sales fell 9.9% the company revealed, saying it had been forced to cut prices amid higher levels of high street discounting than the previous Christmas, on both toys and clothing. The group's international business was also hit by weakening currencies and tricky economic conditions in Russia, Indonesia and India \u2013 three of its five biggest markets. Total group sales were down 6.1%. Simon Calver, Mothercare's chief executive, said: \"In the UK, our stores suffered similar Christmas trading pressures to those reported elsewhere. Customer service scores continue to improve year on year but weaker footfall and higher promotional activity led to lower sales and margins.\" \"A lot of value was coming out of the market, we needed to discount to be in there,\" he said. Calver said the company's Early Learning Centre chain was particularly hard hit as the whole market was forced into earlier than usual discounting amid competition from high-tech alternatives such as tablet computers. The chain's online sales, meanwhile, took a knock from a decision to halt free delivery on sales worth less than \u00a350, a service that proved unprofitable the year before. While online sales at Mothercare.com rose 15% - 20% for the quarter, total direct sales slid 1% because of the poor performance from its sister brand. Calver admitted Mothercare's problems were not only the result of external factors. \"Clearly we didn't do everything right,\" he said. \"We are in the middle of a turnaround but we would like to be further ahead with our ranges, pricing and product in stores.\" He said the company could also improve its online service. Calver has been trying to revive Mothercare by closing unprofitable stores, revamping the remaining branches, improving customer service and increasing international sales. The latest poor figures come despite the closure of about 70 poorly performing stores since Calver's revival plan began. Meanwhile, the retailer faces increasing competition on toys and clothing from growing specialists such as Kiddicare, which is now owned by supermarket Morrisons, as well as John Lewis, Amazon, Argos and the supermarkets. \"The UK baby clothing and equipment market remains very competitive with few retailers in this category making any positive retail margins, especially as high street clothing chains, internet offers and supermarkets continue to grow space and share,\" said Mike Dennis, an analyst at City broker Cantor. Mothercare's experience reflected the story at Debenhams, the department store group which also blamed heavy promotional activity and cautious shoppers for its profit warning earlier this month. In contrast private clothing retailer New Look is understood to have seen a 1.5% rise in same-store sales in the seven weeks to the end of the year. The retailer introduced price cuts of up to 50% on key seasonal product categories including knitwear and outerwear in the weeks before Christmas but discounted less overall than in the same period a year before. Today (Thursday) market bellwether Marks &amp; Spencer will reveal how it fared over Christmas in the face of an overall 9.9% slump in clothing prices in December, according to figures from the British Retail Consortium. While M&amp;S is thought likely to have seen strong food sales, expectations for clothing are low after the store began offering 30% off knitwear, one of its Christmas best sellers, a week before Christmas and expanded that offer to all clothing in the weekend before December 25.",

Chief financial officer John Rogers revised full year guidance lower and warned of a tough financial fourth quarter as consumers reign in their spending after a loose Christmas and by mid-morning the news had everyone back firmly in the red again. Meanwhile banks are continuing their recent strength, with Royal Bank of Scotland rising 5.4p at 355.8p, Lloyds Banking Group up 1p to 83.51p and Barclays 3.15p better at 284.10p. Domino's Pizza has put on 6.5p to 509.5p after it reassured investors with a better than expected rise in UK sales. The company had been under the cosh recently with the announced departures of its chief executive and finance director, concerns about a slowdown of its UK opening programme and worries about its German business. UK sales rose by 10.9% in the fourth quarter, ahead of forecasts of a 1% to 4% gain. It said UK and Irish profits for the year would beat expectations, but German losses would be higher than forecast. Overall full year figures would be in line, the company said.",

      "bodyText": "Prices in British shops fell at their fastest pace in seven years last month as retailers battled for hard-pressed customers with deep discounts on clothing, furniture and electricals. The Christmas drop in prices capped off a cut-throat year for retailers which saw margins eroded and has already prompted one post-Christmas profits warning from department store chain Debenhams. The British Retail Consortium said shop prices fell for the eighth month running in December. The fall of 0.8% on a year earlier was the deepest deflation since the data began in December 2006. The fall in overall shop prices came as non-food prices fell an annual 2.3% in December compared with deflation of 2% in November, according to the monthly data compiled with Nielsen. Food prices continued to rise but at the slowest pace for more than three years.
