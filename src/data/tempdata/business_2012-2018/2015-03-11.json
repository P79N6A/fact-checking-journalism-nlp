      "bodyText": "A fresh plunge in the value of the euro against the dollar was shrugged off by the European Central Bank (ECB) on Wednesday as it said its new growth-boosting policy would work without triggering a global currency war. With the euro on course to dive below parity against the dollar within the next few weeks, one of the ECB\u2019s senior policymakers denied that Frankfurt was deliberately driving the single currency lower in an attempt to secure a competitive advantage. Ewald Nowotny, the head of Austria\u2019s central bank and a member of the ECB\u2019s governing council, said the ECB did not target the exchange rate. \u201cThe ECB, as a central bank, does not have the exchange rate as a policy. It is a side effect of other things.\u201d He added: \u201cExchange rates are not a major dominant factor for the global economy. I think it would be wrong right now to assume that what\u2019s going on is a currency war.\u201d The euro lost more than 1% against the dollar on Wednesday in what one analyst called the \u201cmost rapid and protracted\u201d fall in the euro against the dollar since the single currency was founded in 1999. Meanwhile, the dollar extended its gains and has now risen by more than 10% against a basket of the world\u2019s major currencies \u2013 including the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen \u2013 since the start of 2015. It is on course for its strongest quarterly performance since 1992. Although sterling is trading above \u20ac1.40 against the euro \u2013 its highest level since 2007 \u2013 it fell below $1.50 against the dollar to its lowest level in 20 months. Three factors have combined to send the euro down by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.0540: the likelihood of an increase in US interest rates; the deepening crisis in Greece; and the effect of the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme, launched this month. Despite the fall in the euro to a fresh 12-year low against the dollar, Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s president, said the beneficial effects of QE were already evident, with contagion effects from Greece contained. An upbeat Draghi told a conference in Frankfurt that the eurozone economy was on the mend and hailed the effect of quantitative easing. \u201cWe saw a further fall in the sovereign yields of Portugal and other formerly distressed countries in spite of the renewed Greek crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThis suggests that the asset purchase programme may be shielding euro area countries from contagion. We are aware that our measure may entail some financial stability risks but currently these risks are contained.\u201d Draghi said the slowdown in eurozone growth had reversed and that economic recovery would broaden and \u201chopefully strengthen\u201d. Currency dealers said the depreciation of the euro and the appreciation of the dollar were attributable to ECB and the US Federal Reserve following divergent strategies. The Fed is expected to start raising interest rates within the next three months while the ECB will continue its \u20ac60bn-a-month bond-buying programme. The ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme is driving down the interest rates that eurozone governments have to pay on the money they borrow. Italy and Spain\u2019s 30-year borrowing costs fell below 2% yesterday while the interest rate on 30-year German bonds was lower than the rate on two-year US Treasury bonds. Prospects for eurozone exporters have been boosted by the euro\u2019s decline against the dollar. Michael Hewson, of CMC Markets, said that 10 months ago the euro was close to $1.40 against the dollar and was trading at almost $1.25 as recently as December. \u201cFor now, the euro looks to be headed towards parity. The next target sits at $1.0500 (the March 2003 lows) and it remains a very short hop from there to parity,\u201d Hewson said. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said he had \u201cpencilled in a further fall in the euro to parity against the dollar in the next few months, and it could certainly go lower\u201d. \u201cHowever, we then anticipate a partial recovery in the single currency to about $1.10 by the end of 2016 as the Greek crisis is resolved one way or another and the eurozone\u2019s relative growth performance improves a bit,\u201d he said. Capital Economics estimated the probability of Greece leaving the euro was greater than 50%. \u201cThe precise timing is uncertain, but Greece\u2019s current economic and financial position is unsustainable and, after the initial turmoil, the country would be much better off outside. This suggests that the risks to the euro versus the dollar are still on the downside, as a resurgence of the crisis would add to the pressure from the divergence in monetary policy.\u201d",

The company blamed plunging wholesale electricity prices and very low oil prices for the \u20ac3.2bn deficit, which is more than 50% bigger than the loss recorded 12 months earlier. Profits from the UK supply business remained steady at just under \u00a3300m but its revenues dropped by \u00a3600m. E.ON said the overall downturn in group earnings reflected the difficult energy markets in Germany and Britain, where consumer-subsidised wind and solar power had driven down wholesale prices. \u201cConsidering the continued difficult market environment in many countries, we\u2019re generally satisfied with our 2014 results,\u201d said the group\u2019s chief financial officer, Klaus Sch\u00e4fer.

The parent company used the 2014 annual financial results to give more details of its plans to split the business into two within six months. The E.ON name will be used for the renewable power and supply operation, with the coal- and gas-fired power stations being operated by a rebranded and separate company. The group\u2019s chief executive, Johannes Teyssen, said preparations were already underway for the changes, with details released in the second quarter of this financial year. In Britain it will mean huge wind farms such as the London Array off Kent will remain in the E.ON portfolio while coal and gas-fired stations at Ratcliffe, Nottinghamshire, and elsewhere will move into a separate firm. Teyssen said the energy market would be shaken up by digital and other technological innovation. \u201cWe see a lot of opportunities here for products and services that we\u2019re developing for and in partnership with our customers,\u201d he said.

But RWE has no plans as yet to split its business, although it also plans to concentrate on renewables rather than conventional fossil fuel power stations in future. The moves by the large German-based businesses underlines the way that the energy landscape is changing across western Europe as governments encourage wind and other renewables as part of a switch to a low carbon economy. Ministers are mainly motivated by growing fears about the impact of carbon emissions on climate change but are also determined to improve energy security and wean their countries off Russian gas imports. The situation in Germany has been made more difficult for the big energy providers because the government has forced them to write off their investments in nuclear plants.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s pensioners are emerging from the austerity years with their standard of living unscathed, while their children and grandchildren are struggling to make up the ground they lost in the recession, according to analysis by a thinktank. As George Osborne puts the finishing touches to his pre-election budget, to be delivered next Wednesday, the research from the Resolution Foundation, first published in the Guardian, found that pensioner households saw their incomes jump by almost 10% in real terms between 2007 and 2014. Working-age households suffered a 4% cut. This fresh analysis will reignite the debate about how the benefits of economic recovery are being shared, and whether future governments can continue to protect spending on pensioners at time when issues of intergenerational equity have come to the forefront of political debate. David Cameron recently announced that he would extend his pledge to protect pensioner benefits into the next parliament, while Ed Miliband has tried to win more support from younger voters by proposing to cut student tuition fees by \u00a33,000 a year. Gavin Kelly, the Resolution Foundation\u2019s director, said the sharp divergence in fortunes across the age spectrum resulted from more over-60s being in work, as well as positive policy choices to protect pensions from Osborne\u2019s spending cuts. \u201cPart of it is a wage effect: their wages have fallen dramatically less than younger people\u2019s. Recessions are always bad for younger people; this one has been disastrous,\u201d he said. Employment has surged to record levels since the depths of the downturn \u2013 but not everyone has benefited, according to the analysis. Taking into account wages alone, 22-to-29-year-olds saw a 12.5% fall between 2009 \u2013 the year before the coalition took office \u2013 and 2014. There were declines for every age group over the five-year period, but the decline was most muted for the over-60s, who had a decline of 3.7% in wages according to the thinktank\u2019s analysis. In addition, the coalition\u2019s \u201ctriple lock\u201d, which promises to increase the state pension each year by inflation, average wages, or 2.5%, whichever is the highest, has helped to cushion pensioners\u2019 incomes. Yet the coalition has continued to devise new policies to tempt pensioners, including new rights for older workers to dip into their retirement pots, and generous savings bonds targeted exclusively at the over-65s. Angus Hanton, co-founder of the pressure group Intergenerational Foundation, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that the interests of the young are being sacrificed for the comfort of wealthier older people. The packhorse generation may start to question the social contract when they see these \u2018woldies\u2019 receiving special treatment from pensioner bonds, the triple lock, and undeserved benefits.\u201d Kelly argued that young people\u2019s experiences in Britain\u2019s super-flexible, deregulated labour market were deteriorating even before the recession. \u201cThe transitional period from learning into stable work for the young has become more stretched-out over the past 10 to 15 years, and the big fall in demand in the labour market during the crisis has intensified that process.\u201d Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the income of older people had changed dramatically: \u201cTwenty or 30 years ago, to be a pensioner in this country was more often than not to be seriously poor, and it\u2019s very good news it\u2019s not like that today.\u201d But she added that the figures showing greater resilience for pensioner incomes were averages. \u201cThe figures gloss over the fact that pensioner poverty unfortunately still exists and affects a substantial number of older people \u2013 1.6 million in total,\u201d she added. Frances O\u2019Grady, secretary general of the TUC, said: \u201cThe post-crash economy seems to be changing shape for the worse. Young people have been hit particularly hard. The government seems to think they should just downgrade their expectations and work for free. But what we really need is a plan for growth, including job guarantees for young people and a faster increase in the minimum wage.\u201d Miliband has promised to tackle low pay by increasing the minimum wage to \u00a38 an hour by 2020, and the prime minister recently called on businesses to give their employees a pay rise. But John Cridland, the director-general of the CBI, will use a speech at a Resolution Foundation event to launch the findings on Thursday to warn politicians against intervening to boost the minimum wage. \u201cTelling the independent Low Pay Commission what level to set the minimum wage at could potentially damage one of the most successful government policies in years and put jobs at risk,\u201d he will argue, urging the government to cut National Insurance contributions instead, so that workers can \u201ctake home more of the recovery at the end of the month\u201d. As well as varying by age group, Resolution finds that voters\u2019 experiences of the downturn have also differed widely according to how rich or poor they were before the crisis broke. All but the poorest households saw their incomes decline during what it calls the \u201cbig squeeze\u201d, from the start of the crisis to 2012. But the upturn since then has benefited middle earners \u2013 the erstwhile \u201csqueezed middle\u201d \u2013 while the richest and poorest groups have seen their living standards continue to fall. Middle earners have seized the bulk of the benefit from the coalition\u2019s tax-cutting measures, such as the increase in the personal tax allowance, while the poorest have borne the brunt of benefits cuts. Kelly said that with the coalition\u2019s spending plans involving further welfare reductions \u2013 including capping benefit rises at 1% for the next three years \u2013 it was unlikely that this bottom income group would see their fortunes improve much in the near future. \u201cGiven what\u2019s in store for working-age benefits under current plans, it\u2019s very hard to be optimistic about incomes in this group over the next parliament even if we do see steady pay growth,\u201d he said. The Treasury said average household incomes had been restored to around their pre-crisis levels and were expected to grow well above inflation this year, adding: \u201cIncome inequality is lower than when this government came into office.\u201d The worsening age divide in Britain\u2019s economy is further underlined by a separate study from the London School of Economics which shows that low wages are only part of the picture, and younger workers lag far behind in wealth, too. After decades of house price appreciation, which has disproportionately benefited older homeowners, the wealth of the average 25-34 year old is \u00a3365,000 lower than that of someone 30 years older, according to the LSE\u2019s John Hills, who heads the LSE\u2019s Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion. Today\u2019s average 30-year-old would have to save \u00a333 a day for three decades to achieve the average wealth of today\u2019s 60-year-olds. Since this is highly unlikely, the fortunes of many young people will depend on whether they can rely on inherited wealth from their parents. Hills said policymakers need to understand that \u201cthe costs of the crisis have not been evenly borne and, disproportionately, young people have paid the price.\u201d",

But the upturn since then has benefited middle earners \u2013 the erstwhile \u201csqueezed middle\u201d \u2013 while the richest and poorest groups have seen their living standards continue to fall.</p> <p>Middle earners have seized the bulk of the benefit from the coalition\u2019s tax-cutting measures, such as the increase in the personal tax allowance, while the poorest have borne the brunt of benefits cuts.</p> <p>Kelly said that with the coalition\u2019s spending plans involving further welfare reductions \u2013 including capping benefit rises at 1% for the next three years \u2013 it was unlikely that this bottom income group would see their fortunes improve much in the near future.<br></p> <p>\u201cGiven what\u2019s in store for working-age benefits under current plans, it\u2019s very hard to be optimistic about incomes in this group over the next parliament even if we do see steady pay growth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Treasury said average household incomes had been restored to around their pre-crisis levels and were expected to grow well above inflation this year, adding: \u201cIncome inequality is lower than when this government came into office.\u201d </p> <p>The worsening age divide in Britain\u2019s economy is further underlined by a separate study from the London School of Economics which shows that low wages are only part of the picture, and younger workers lag far behind in wealth, too.</p> <p>After decades of house price appreciation, which has disproportionately benefited older homeowners, the wealth of the average 25-34 year old is \u00a3365,000 lower than that of someone 30 years older, according to the LSE\u2019s John Hills, who heads the LSE\u2019s <a href=\"http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/case/\">Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion</a>.</p> <p>Today\u2019s average 30-year-old would have to save \u00a333 a day for three decades to achieve the average wealth of today\u2019s 60-year-olds. Since this is highly unlikely, the fortunes of many young people will depend on whether they can rely on inherited wealth from their parents.</p> <p>Hills said policymakers need to understand that \u201cthe costs of the crisis have not been evenly borne and, disproportionately, young people have paid the price.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, folks. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Thanks for all your great comments. On Wall Street, stocks have recovered somewhat from recent losses. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently up more than 30 points at 17,696.17, a 0.2% gain, while the S&amp;P 500 is also 0.2% ahead at 2,047.52. Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Connecticut told Reuters: There\u2019s a growing acceptance that the Fed will raise interest rates possibly as soon as June, and people continue to reel in shock as to how far the ECB is likely to remain at zero. In the meantime, on the back of a big fall, for stocks it looks like people are regrouping again today. The euro sank to a 12-year low against the dollar, falling as low as $1.0537. This helped lift Germany\u2019s Dax to a record high [see 16:53], as major exporters like Volkswagen and BMW will benefit from a weaker euro. Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale also indicated that he could vote for higher borrowing costs in coming months. One of the four independent members of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee, he said that despite global worries about low inflation the decision about whether to raise interest rates was finely balanced. Read our story in full here. The FTSE 100 stocks that are most exposed to the euro (i.e. get more than half their revenues from the eurozone) include Imperial Tobacco, 3i, Vodafone and Easyjet. In the other indices, Thomas Cook, Flybe, Hansteen and Capital &amp; Regional all generate the bulk of their business in the eurozone. The IMF loan to Ukraine is (obviously) based on an economic reform programme supported by the fund. Here is Lagarde\u2019s statement in full. The change in the IMF-supported program from Stand-By Arrangement to Extended Arrangement under the EFF, which is consistent with the more protracted nature of Ukraine\u2019s balance-of-payment needs, will provide more funding, more time, more flexibility, and better financing terms for Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to reform. They have maintained fiscal discipline in very difficult conditions; allowed the exchange rate to adjust; and have increased retail end-user prices for gas. Many key measures are front-loaded under the new program\u2014including further sizable energy tariff increases; bank restructuring; governance reforms of state-owned enterprises; and legal changes aimed at combating corruption and strengthening the rule of law. To help cushion the impact of adjustment, especially for the poorest groups, measures are being taken to strengthen and better target the social safety net.\u201d The program is ambitious and involves risks, notably those stemming from the conflict in the east of the country. I am heartened that the cease-fire agreed last month in Minsk seems to be largely holding for now, and hope that a further loss of life can be avoided. I wish the authorities well as they embark on this new economic reform program. With continued firm implementation, there is reasonably strong prospect of success. Breaking news: The IMF has signed off on a four-year loan programme for Ukraine worth $17.5bn. IMF chief Christine Lagarde said described it as ambitious, but added that there is a \u201creasonably strong prospect of success\u201d. European stock markets have closed. FTSE 100 index rises 18.67 points to 6,721.51, a 0.3% gain Germany\u2019s Dax closes 2.7% higher at 11,805.41, setting a fresh record closing high France\u2019s CAC gains 2.4% to 4,997.28 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB adds 2.2% to 22,833.04 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 1% at 11,009.7 The Greek stock market lost 2.5% to 797.3 Here in the UK, Bank of England rate-setter Martin Weale sees the risk of a sharp fall in sterling because of the country\u2019s large balance of payments deficit. Britain\u2019s current account deficit was equivalent to 6% of GDP in the third quarter of last year, matching the biggest deficit on record. After giving a speech in London, Weale said, echoing comments he made last month: Certainly it seems to me that there is a risk of a sharp movement in the exchange rate. I would be inclined to say more of a risk of a sharp downward movement. The economy always springs surprises, and what\u2019s been happening to sterling in the last few weeks has been one of those surprises. Greek wages edged up 0.3% in the fourth quarter of last year compared with a year earlier, according to the Hellenic Statistical Authority. Seasonally adjusted, the wage index grew 1.4%, after an 8.3% decline in the same quarter in 2013. The Greek stock market has ended the day 2.5% lower at 797.30 points, below the 800 point level for the first time in 18 sessions. Bank shares suffered some of the heaviest losses, including National Bank, Eurobank and Alpha Bank. Anti-German sentiment has not been confined to the Greek justice minister, writes Helena Smith. Senior officials in Athens have been railing against Berlin today. Before Greece\u2019s justice minister Nikos Paraskevopoulos raised the prospect of seizing German assets to pay war reparations, Dimitris Stratoulis, the minister in charge of social security, was also railing against Berlin\u2019s hegemony of Europe. The role of Europe\u2019s paymaster as dominant player in Europe was over, he told ANT 1 TV today. And, he said it would only get worse when the anti-establishment Podemos party was also catapulted into power later this year. He said: \u201cGermany\u2019s Europe has finished, [the Europe] where Germany forbids and all the other countries execute orders is over. In November when [Spain\u2019s anti-austerity party] Podemos is elected, things will be even worse for them. The radical left Syriza party was not elected to placate Germany, he said, but to offer relief to austerity-hit Greeks. We were elected so the Greek people could breathe. German chancellor Angela Merkel narrowly escaped a much bigger rebellion among her conservatives last month, many of whom would have opposed Greece\u2019s bailout extension had it not been for her finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s powers of persuasion. Germany\u2019s parliament overwhelmingly passed the extension on 27 February, even though a record number of conservatives voted against. (29 of the 32 parliamentarians who voted against came from Merkel\u2019s CDU and its Bavarian sister party CSU.) One senior conservative told Reuters that the CSU, \u201cwould have unanimously voted \u201cno\u201d had Sch\u00e4uble not drummed up support personally two days before the vote. Another leading conservative said Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s meeting with CDU lawmakers was equally important in securing their backing at a time when confidence in the Greek government was \u201ckaputt\u201d in the Bundestag, the lower chamber. The lawmaker said: \u201cThe vote was hanging by a thread\u201d. This is indicative of the growing discontent within Merkel\u2019s conservative ranks, amid fears that Greece might need a third bailout. Germans are also outraged by Athens\u2019 anti-German rhetoric, in particular Tsipras\u2019 comments on seeking war reparations from Berlin. In contrast, Merkel\u2019s coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democrats, and the opposition Greens, voted unanimously in favour of the four-month extension. The pound has hit its lowest level against the dollar in 20 months, amid growing expectations that US interest rates will rise in coming months. Sterling fell almost 1% to $1.4929 at one stage. The dollar, for its part, has gained more than 10% against a basket of six major currencies so far this year, led by its rise against the euro. This puts it on track for its best quarterly performance since 1992. Back on Greece, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent Helena Smith says the planned return of the troika is already causing ruptions within the governing Syriza party. Energy minister Panaghiotis Lafazanis, who heads the far Left Platform in the governing Syriza party, told an international conference on energy security in Athens: \u201cGreece is a very small country to remain a dependent economic protectorate of the troika.\u201d The anti-austerity government would resist the demand to privatize companies in the energy sector, he insisted. The Left Platform, which represents about 30% of Syriza, issued a lacerating statement after Monday\u2019s euro group denouncing German tactics towards Greece. \u201cThe country\u2019s lenders are not only not relenting, they are intensifying their pressure and blackmailing tactics so the government will submit and mercilessly enforce the new-memorandum,\u201d it railed. \u201cAt the same time the neo-colonialists in Brussels, and especially [German finance minister Wolfgang] Sch\u00e4uble\u2026 are warning that they won\u2019t accept \u201cunilateral actions,\u201d that is measures that would ease [the plight] of the Greek people. A eurozone policymaker has rejected the idea that the central bank is helping to push the euro lower to gain competitive advantage in the region. Ewald Nowotny, head of Austria\u2019s central bank and a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council told an audience in Frankfurt: The ECB, as a central bank, does not have [the] exchange rate as a policy. It\u2019s a side effect of other things. Exchange rates ... are not a major dominant factor for the global economy. I think it would be wrong to assume that what is going on right now is a c currency war. US stock markets are up slightly in early trading following sharp falls on Tuesday. Dow Jones: +0.2% at 17,702.78 S&amp;P 500: +0.1% at 2,046.06 Nasdaq: +0.2% at 4,336.48 Reuters is reporting that doubts over Greece\u2019s future membership of the eurozone are straining its relationship with Cyprus. Cyprus wants to reverse a perception that the two countries are inextricably linked, worried that it could be dragged down with Greece, should Athens\u2019 finances collapse and force the Greeks to abandon the euro. The fate of Cyprus, a divided island on Europe\u2019s frontier with the Middle East, could prove an important test of the durability of the eurozone and the wider European Union in the face of political uncertainty in Greece. \u201c(Sharing a) language is one thing but being the same economy is completely different,\u201d said Harris Georgiades, finance minister of a country largely populated by Greek Cypriots. Linguistic solidarity leads Cyprus and Greece to give each other\u2019s contestant the top score each year in the Eurovision song contest. \u201cThere are cultural ties but that\u2019s it. We are following our own course,\u201d Georgiades told Reuters in an interview. Unlike Greece, Cyprus has been largely diligent in implementing reforms required in return for an international bailout it received in 2013. There has been little public protest despite the deep recession that ensued. Their paths have diverged more sharply since the radical leftist Syriza party won power in Greece in January, denouncing austerity and demanding a reduction of its official debt. The centre-right Cypriot government blames former Communist President Dimitris Christofias for delaying a cleanup of Cypriot banks that made the eventual bailout more painful. Cyprus hopes to return to borrowing on bond markets this year, Georgiades said, while Athens has little such prospect. Trade ties are modest. Greece ranks second behind Britain in selling services to Cyprus, such as holidays, but it lags far behind Russia, Britain and Germany as a customer. The former British colony has also severed its banks\u2019 links to Greece that resulted in heavy losses when Greek bonds were restructured or \u2018haircut\u2019. It was those losses that fatally compromised the Cypriot financial system and prompted its bailout. \u201cWe hope that there will be no problems in Greece,\u201d said Chrystalla Georghadji, the governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus. \u201cBut if there are any problems, the banks here are ring-fenced.\u201d The German government has dismissed threats from the Greek government, which has claimed it is ready to seize German assets as compensation for Nazi war crimes. Steffen Seibert, spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel said: It is our firm belief that questions of reparations and compensation have been legally and politically resolved. We should concentrate on current issues and, hopefully, what will be a good future. A spokesman for the German finance ministry said there was no reason to hold talks about reparations and that the demands were a distraction from the serious financial issues facing Greece. Greek shares are down 1% this morning with the main ATG index at 808.69. Greece has yet to come up with a package of reforms that its creditors are happy with. A final tranche of funding under the existing bailout will only be released if agreement is reached on reforms. The proposals offered up by Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis have thus far been rejected by eurozone finance ministers as too vague and inadequate. A reminder of what the initial proposals from Greece were: 1) Creating an Office for Fiscal Responsibility, to monitor government policy 2) Improving budget preparation 3) Hiring \u2018casual onlookers\u2019 to fight tax evasion -- citizens and tourists wired up with recording kit to find evidence of firms dodging VAT. 4) Tackling Greece\u2019s unpaid tax problem, by offering a discount to those in arrears and writing off some of the \u2018unrecoverable\u2019 debts. 5) Offering new licences to online gambling sites, replacing the current system which doesn\u2019t raise any revenue 6) Reforms to force government agencies to share information better, rather than bombarding citizens with requests. 7) New allowances for food and rent for poorest Greek families, and reconnecting power supplies to those who have been disconnected for not paying their bills. Hostility between Germany and Greece is building. Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble described Varoufakis as \u201cfoolishly naive\u201d on Tuesday, referring to the Greek finance minister\u2019s comments to the press. And today Greece has raised the stakes by suggesting it will not be lectured by a country that has Germany\u2019s past. See last post below. Tensions between Greece and Germany have been raised a few notches, with reports from Athens that justice minister Nikos Paraskevopoulos is threatening to seize German assets to compensate Greek victims of Nazi war crimes. This report from Greek daily newspaper ekathimerini: Justice Minister Nikos Paraskevopoulos has said he is ready to sign an older court ruling that will enable the foreclosure of German assets in Greece in order to compensate the relatives of victims of Nazi crimes during the Second World War. Greece\u2019s Supreme Court ruled in favor of Distomo survivors in 2000, but the decision has not been enforced. Distomo, a small village in central Greece, lost 218 lives in a Nazi massacre in 1944. \u201cThe law states that in order to implement the ruling of the Supreme Court, the minister of justice has to order it. I believe this permission should be given and I\u2019m ready to give it, notwithstanding any obstacles,\u201d Paraskevopoulos told Antenna TV on Wednesday. \u201cThere must probably be some negotiation with Germany,\u201d said Paraskevopoulos, who first announced his intention Tuesday during a Parliament debate on the creation of a committee to seek war reparations, the repayment of a forced loan and the return of antiquities. During the same debate, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras expressed his government\u2019s firm intention to seek war reparations from Germany, noting that Athens would show sensitivity that it hoped to see reciprocated from Berlin. Tsipras told MPs that the matter of war reparations was \u201cvery technical and sensitive\u201d but one he has a duty to pursue. He also seemed to indirectly connect the matter to talks between Greece and its international creditors on the country\u2019s loan program. \u201cThe Greek government will strive to honor its commitments to the full,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will also strive to ensure all unfulfilled obligations toward Greece and the Greek people are fulfilled,\u201d he added. \u201cYou cannot pick and choose on ethical issues.\u201d Tsipras noted that Germany got support \u201cdespite the crimes of the Third Reich\u201d chiefly thanks to the London Debt Agreement of 1953. Since reunification, German governments have used \u201csilence, legal tricks and delays\u201d to avoid solving the problem, he said. \u201cWe are not giving morality lessons but we will not accept morality lessons either,\u201d Tsipras said. The euro is now down more than 1% against the dollar at \u20ac1.0572. That\u2019s the lowest since April 2003. It was as low as \u20ac1.0561 earlier this morning. The euro has also hit a seven-year low against the pound, at 70.14p. Greece has successfully sold \u20ac1.3bn of Treasury bills, covering the amount it needed to refinance a maturing issue. The issue was more costly for the government however, with the paper sold at a yield of 2.7%, up from the 2.5% yield at a previous sale in February. From Reuters: Issuing short-term T-bills is the only source of commercial borrowing for the leftist government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. The country\u2019s EU/IMF creditors have set a 15 billion euro cap on such issues, which has already been hit. Athens has asked for the ceiling on outstanding T-bills to be raised as foreign investors have increasingly fled its sales in recent months, but its euro zone partners have refused on fears it would be tantamount to central bank financing of governments. We are hearing that the Troika\u2019s meeting with Greek officials has indeed been delayed and that representatives from the ECB, IMF and EC will arrive in Athens tomorrow - a day later than expected. It is not clear why. More if and when we get it. An update from Athens. Confusion reigns over whether the troika - ECB, IMF and EC - are meeting Greek officials today or not. That was the expectation at the conclusion of the eurogroup meeting of finance ministers on Monday, but there has been no information as yet today. We have put in calls and will keep you updated. Meanwhile, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, brings us this report on the subject. Officials in Athens are saying it is not at all clear when international auditors representing Greece\u2019s creditors will descend on the capital. Officials in prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 anti-austerity government are suggesting that it had still not been decided when inspectors will arrive. Speaking on local radio this morning, alternate economics minister Dimitris Mardas indicated they would not fly into Greece until Thursday. \u201cIf it is agreed they will come tomorrow, we are ready,\u201d he said. But Mardas, who is responsible for revenue collection, ruled out the inspection review resembling anything from the past. \u201cLets emphasise what won\u2019t happen. What won\u2019t happen is the hauling from ministry to ministry by the threesome that we saw in the past. We are not going to see various ministers running behind the troika. That is over.\u201d Tsipras is facing considerable - and growing discontent \u2013 from the far-left faction of his Syriza group. The Treasury has responded to the disappointing UK industrial production/manufacturing figures. A spokeswoman emphasises the quarterly figures, which paint a more picture - industrial production up 1.1% and manufacturing up 2.6%. She said: Today\u2019s figures from the ONS show manufacturing output grew by 2.6% in the three months to January compared to a year ago. The UK has seen the fastest growth in the G7 but is not immune to the risks facing the global economy. The job is not yet done and all of the progress we have made will be at risk unless we carry on working through the long term economic plan which is delivering economic security. So nothing new in the well-rehearsed lines there. UK industrial production and manufacturing both fell unexpectedly in January according to the latest figures published by the Office for National Statistics. Industrial production fell by 0.1% over the month, dragged down by manufacturing output which fell 0.5%. Economists had forecast growth of 0.2% for both. The main reason for the falls appears to be a decline in computers and other electronic products. On an annual basis, industrial production increased by 1.3%, while manufacturing output was up 1.9%. The reason why industrial production didn\u2019t fall further was a 2% rise in mining and quarrying over the month of January. It followed a 1.4% fall in December, and the ONS said January\u2019s increased appeared to be driven by a rebound in oil and gas extraction in the north sea. Christian Schulz, senior economist at German bank Berenberg, said the figures suggested British industry \u201chad a subdued start into the new year\u201d: The volatile monthly changes should not be over-interpreted, but with German manufacturing flat and French manufacturing down only marginally in January, we cannot exclude that sterling\u2019s current strength against the euro may hurt the export-dependent sector. While UK manufacturing output should be relatively price-insensitive, the pound\u2019s rise by 11% against the euro since December could become a significant head-wind for market share and profitability for UK producers in Europe in the near-term. At this early stage, the disappointing January industrial output data puts only a very minor downside risk to our call for strengthening UK GDP growth in Q1 (to 0.8% quarter-on-quarter from 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in Q4). How low can the euro go against the dollar? Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says its looking like parity. Few would have imagined in May last year when EURUSD was trading just shy of 1.4000 that nearly 10 months later the currency would have slid nearly 35% to be trading just short of 1.0700 with the potential to go even lower. A good part of this move lower has occurred in the past three months sliding from 1.2480 at the beginning of December, as currency markets bet on the fact that the European Central Bank would finally pull the trigger on a large scale easing (QE) program. Six years to the day from when the Federal Reserve started its bond buying program in 2009 the ECB finally pulled the trigger on its highly flagged stimulus program, putting aside the legal niceties that buying bonds with a negative yield surely has to be construed as monetary financing. The weakness in the euro has been compounded by the fact that the US economy shows continued signs of an improvement, with the possibility that after last week\u2019s stellar jobs numbers, that next week\u2019s FOMC meeting could well see the removal of the word \u201cpatience\u201d from the Fed\u2019s statement with respect to the timing of a rate hike. This would be important given that markets have inferred from previous comments made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen that the removal of the language of patience could suggest the prospect of a rate hike within the timeframe of the next two meetings. For now the euro looks to be headed towards parity. The next target sits at 1.0500 (the March 2003 lows) and it remains a very short hop from there to parity. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank is oozing optimism at a conference in Frankfurt. His view is that the ECB\u2019s \u20ac1.1 trillion programme of quantitative easing - with bond purchases starting two days ago - may already be protecting eurozone countries from the Greek crisis. We saw a further fall in the sovereign yields of Portugal and other formerly distressed countries in spite of the renewed Greek crisis. This suggests that the asset purchase programme may be shielding euro area countries from contagion. We are aware that our measure may entail some financial stability risks but currently these risks are contained. Other points made by Draghi: The slowdown in eurozone growth has reversed Economic recovery should gradually broaden and hopefully strengthen Upwardly revised ECB forecasts are conditional upon the full implementation of all the Bank\u2019s announced measures We are deploying monetary policy in a way that will stabilise inflation There is good reason to believe that as our balance sheet expands, it will support a rebound in inflation expectations The euro has hit another 12-year low against this morning, falling to $1.0640. It has fallen 12% since the beginning of 2015, and 35% since last May. It is a story of dollar strength as well as euro weakness, as the US Federal Reserve moves closer towards an interest rate rise while at the opposite end of the scale, the European Central Bank is injecting \u20ac1.1 trillion into the financial system through quantitative easing. Parity here we come? The euro is also down 0.3% against the yen, at 129.12 yen, the lowest since mid 2013. Following yesterday\u2019s sharp sell off, led by the FTSE 100 which closed down 2.5% or 174 points at 6,702.84, European markets are slightly up in early trading. It\u2019s hardly a major rebound though, as those weak China numbers and an uncertain future for Greece weigh on confidence. FTSE 100: +0.4% at 6,729.94 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.3% at 11,539.55 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 4,909.12 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 22,518.86 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.6% at 10,964.5 Fears over a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China were raised overnight following a slew of weak data from the national statistics bureau. Industrial output grew 6.8% over the first two months of the year, compared with the same period last year, disappointing expectations of a 7.8% increase and the weakest rate of growth since late 2008. Retail sales also disappointed over January and February, with growth of 10.7% the weakest in a decade and weaker than the 11.7% increase forecast by economists. And finally, investment - a crucial indicator of the health of the Chinese economy - increased by 13.9%. It was the weakest growth since 2001, and came in below expectations of a 15% rise. Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics: Today\u2019s activity data have put pay to our expectation that GDP growth would strengthened slightly in Q1, with a slowdown now looking more likely. Overall, the weakness in today\u2019s figures is surprising given that a sharp slowdown in Q1 of last year will have provided a flattering base for comparison. The upshot is that economic momentum appears markedly weaker than suggested by the recent recovery in export growth and PMI readings. As such, a further slowdown in GDP growth in this quarter now looks likely. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Markets fells sharply as a combination of factors weighed heavily on investor minds on both sides of the Atlantic. The euro fell to a 12-year low against the dollar, largely as fears over Greece\u2019s future persisted. Dollar strength and fears over China meanwhile weighed on commodity prices, pushing the value of energy companies lower. Overnight China gave investors more reason to be fearful, with data on factory output, retail sales, and investment disappointing expectations and raising concerns over a sharp slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy. More on that soon. The other major event on the agenda today is Greece\u2019s meeting with its creditors. Greek officials will meet with representatives from the European Central Bank, European commission, and the International Monetary Fund in Brussels and in Athens. The aim of the meeting is to make progress on Greek reforms so that a loan instalment can be released before Greece runs out of money. We will bring you all the latest developments.",

But he changed his mind as a result of the halving of oil prices, which has left inflation as measured by the consumer price index at 0.3%.</p> <p>In speech in London on Wednesday, Weale said: \u201cCompared with the autumn, when I was voting for an increase in [the] Bank rate, the fall in oil prices has certainly provided some unexpected breathing space.

      "bodyText": "The prospect of another split at the Bank of England over interest rates has emerged as one of its leading \u201chawks\u201d says he could see himself voting for higher borrowing costs over the coming months. Martin Weale, one of the four independent members of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee, said that despite global worries about low inflation the decision about whether to raise interest rates was finely balanced. Weale voted for a rate rise in the closing months of 2014 along with fellow MPC member Ian McCafferty. But he changed his mind as a result of the halving of oil prices, which has left inflation as measured by the consumer price index at 0.3%. In speech in London on Wednesday, Weale said: \u201cCompared with the autumn, when I was voting for an increase in [the] Bank rate, the fall in oil prices has certainly provided some unexpected breathing space. It is, however, at present no more than that.\u201d He said there was a risk that low inflation would become entrenched, identifying the recent rise in the value of sterling as the next factor that could push the cost of living lower. But Weale said there was also an upside threat to inflation from the labour market. \u201cThe unemployment rate has been falling rapidly, and we have also seen the employment rate reach a record high,\u201d he said, adding that job vacancies were back to pre-crisis levels. Although growth in average earnings is running at around the 4% level seen before the deep recession of 2008-09, he said that \u201cpay is now growing at its fastest rate since before the crisis\u201d. He added: \u201cIf wage growth continues to accelerate over the next few months, especially in the absence of a pickup in productivity, then for me it strengthens the case for a rise in [the] Bank rate. As always, however, I will decide how to cast my vote in the light of economic developments.\u201d",

It has moved into the hi-tech market of digital label printing, which has pitted it against much larger rivals such as Epson and Xerox.

      "bodyText": "A Cambridge-based maker of barcode printers has agreed a \u00a31bn takeover by Japanese multinational Brother. Shares in the company, Domino, surged more than 30% after speculation that a rival bidder might emerge. Domino makes printers to stamp barcodes and expiry dates on food items, drinks cans and medicines. It has moved into the hi-tech market of digital label printing, which has pitted it against much larger rivals such as Epson and Xerox. Printing of package labels is the fastest-growing part of the digital printing market. Under the terms of the offer agreed by the boards of both companies, Domino shareholders will receive 915p a share in cash, a 27% premium to Tuesday\u2019s closing share price of 721p. But on Wednesday the shares jumped to 946p on news of the offer as the market speculated on the possibility of an international bidding war led by US groups. Domino shares closed the day at 941p.

    "webTitle": "Foxtons cuts up to 60 jobs after downturn in London property market", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Foxtons has made up to 60 of its agents redundant after a sudden downturn in the London property market that caused the estate agent\u2019s annual profit to fall. The London-based agent hired extra staff early last year expecting the frenzied property market to continue. But an abrupt slowdown in the second half prompted it to cut between 50 and 60 jobs \u2013 representing up to 7% of its workforce \u2013 towards the end of the year. Foxtons\u2019 chief executive, Nic Budden, told industry analysts: \u201cWe saw very significant activity in the market during the first half of 2014. We had already used up excess capacity in the business in 2013. We began to recruit for what we thought was a longer term uplift and as the downturn came we were a little bit overstaffed and we reduced that overstaffing.\u201d The job losses may not draw that much sympathy from buyers and sellers of houses in London. Foxtons\u2019 sharp-suited agents are known for their aggressive sales tactics, high commissions and for driving round in liveried Minis. Foxtons employees are encouraged to live on their wits and have little security from the outset. When a new agent is hired, they are given the use of a boldly painted Foxtons Mini and can choose to earn a \u00a310,000 salary \u2013 less than the minimum wage \u2013 plus 10% commission or a \u00a317,500 salary plus 5% commission. The group\u2019s earnings before interest, tax, debt and exceptional items fell by 6.9% to \u00a346.2m in the year ending 31 December. The figure, Foxtons\u2019 preferred measure, was roughly in line with analysts\u2019 average forecasts. Pre-tax profit rose 8.2% to \u00a342.1m. Foxtons blamed much of the market slowdown on wariness among buyers and sellers created by the approaching general election. Budden said: \u201cWe see the sales market remaining somewhat constrained until at least after the general election and even then we will need some certainty and clarity in the market before we can predict with any level of certainty where volumes are likely to move in the market.\u201d Foxtons is warier about prospects for the property market this year than its rival, Countrywide, which said late last month it expected some sluggishness until the election. Labour has proposed a mansion tax and there is general pressure to find new ways to tax property because rich people cannot move their houses to avoid the taxman. With the polls tight and another coalition government a possibility, Foxtons thinks it may take longer for buyers and sellers to feel confident about government policy. Budden warned that even an immediate boost to the market following May\u2019s election would take until the final quarter of the year to turn into revenue. Business at Foxtons boomed after it floated on the stock market in 2013 as the property market took off after years in the doldrums. But the company warned in October that annual earnings would be well below forecasts of \u00a357m as the London market slowed down. Foxtons listed its shares at 230p in September 2013 and they jumped to 399p by the end of February 2014 as activity in the London housing market became feverish. They have roughly halved since then and were down 2% at 202.75p in late morning trading on Wednesday. One of Foxtons\u2019 tactics is to charge no commission when it opens a new branch to win business from established agents. Budden said it sold 500 houses for zero commission last year at a cost of about \u00a35m and that sometimes new branches were taking sales from nearby Foxtons offices. \u201cWe may look to attenuate it in bits and pieces\u201d in those circumstances but the policy will remain broadly intact, he said.",

      "bodyText": "Strong consumer spending and the performance of the dominant service sector have made Britain\u2019s businesses increasingly confident about their prospects over the next two years, according to the British Chambers of Commerce. In its quarterly health check of the economy, the BCC said it was upgrading its growth forecast for the next two years amid signs that its members were shrugging off international uncertainty and concerns about the outcome of the general election in May. The BCC said it was now believed that national output would grow by 2.7% in 2015 and 2.6% in 2016 \u2013 up by 0.1 percentage point and 0.2 percentage points respectively. Growth in the first quarter of 2015 is predicted to accelerate from 0.5% to 0.7%. Consumer spending is likely to be supported by the continuation of the UK\u2019s ultra-low interest rates, which have been at 0.5% for the past six years. The BCC said it did not expect the Bank of England to start pushing up the cost of borrowing until the first quarter of 2016 at the earliest. John Longworth, the BCC\u2019s director general, welcomed the growth upgrade but warned of the dangers of the economy becoming too dependent on consumer spending. \u201cWe are upgrading our UK growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016 because businesses up and down the country are doing well \u2013 despite international and domestic uncertainty,\u201d Longworth said. \u201cWhile 2015 has got off to a good start, there is no room for complacency. The UK is still a long way from achieving the great, sustainable, long-term growth we want to see. \u201cConsumer spending is one of the key drivers in our growth upgrade. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with consumer confidence, a balanced economy that will provide growth and jobs in the long term needs a much bigger contribution from business investment and exports.\u201d The BCC said it expected business investment to grow by 3.5% in 2015 compared with 6.8% in 2014, before recovering to 7%-plus growth in both 2016 and 2017. Exports are predicted to increase by 3.7% in 2015, up from the BCC\u2019s previous forecast of 1.9%. Longworth said: \u201cThis year\u2019s slowdown in business investment is a clear warning sign that politicians must do everything they can to create a stable and positive investment environment, and ensure businesses can get access to the finance they need. \u201cWhilst UK exports made welcome progress at the end of 2014, imports are still increasing at a faster rate \u2013 and our growing current account deficit remains a huge challenge. With an unsustainable, negative balance, we have a way to go to reach the government\u2019s 2020 export targets, and to restore our current account to health.\u201d",

Exports are predicted to increase by 3.7% in 2015, up from the BCC\u2019s previous forecast of 1.9%.</p> <p>Longworth said: \u201cThis year\u2019s slowdown in business investment is a clear warning sign that politicians must do everything they can to create a stable and positive investment environment, and ensure businesses can get access to the finance they need. </p> <p> \u201cWhilst UK exports made welcome progress at the end of 2014, imports are still increasing at a faster rate \u2013 and our growing current account deficit remains a huge challenge. With an unsustainable, negative balance, we have a way to go to reach the government\u2019s 2020 export targets, and to restore our current account to health.\u201d</p>",
