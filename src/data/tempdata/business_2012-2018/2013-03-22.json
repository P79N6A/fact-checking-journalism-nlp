    "webTitle": "The postmortem on the Cyprus crisis will be ugly | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u2022 Assume the crisis in Cyprus is patched up this weekend or on Monday \u2013 it is still the way to bet because both sides have too much to lose. After its struggles in Athens and elsewhere, the eurogroup surely won't let a member of the single currency fall out for the sake of a few billion euros. Equally, the Cypriot government must know what a hole it is in. There is no salvation from Russia; and, by threatening to cut off liquidity from the country's stricken banks, the European Central Bank has put its credibility on the line. The main ingredients are all there for another serving of euro fudge. But what would come next? For Cyprus, the immediate future is bleak. In effect, Germany is telling the country to find a new occupation. Bloated offshore banking, with a speciality in Russian deposits, doesn't fit the shiny new euro model of banking union. Try tourism, perhaps. Cypriots might complain these rules were not made clear when they joined the euro only five years ago. They'd be right. But their best strategy today is to stay within the club and, like Greece, try to negotiate better terms another day. It's the reaction outside Cyprus that matters for the future of the euro. Investors' postmortem on the mess could be dangerous. Two points will stand out: First, the handling of the crisis has been farcical, and has undermined confidence in Berlin's and Brussels' firefighting skills. Woe in Nicosia was inevitable once the last Greek restructuring whacked bondholders, including Cypriot banks. Yet, with ample time for all sides to prepare, the banks have been closed for a week and the negotiations are going down to the wire. True, Cypriot politics aren't easy. But next time it might be Italian politics. Second, confidence has been shattered in the notion that eurozone depositors with less than \u20ac100,000 are sacrosanct. Under plan A the eurogroup was prepared to trample on the one principle that was understood across the continent. There's no knowing the damage that will do. And how will bigger depositors in Spanish and Italian banks react? If their instinct is to seek safety elsewhere, a lot more trouble is in store. \u2022 It is now government policy that house prices must not be allowed to fall. That is the main lesson to be drawn from George Osborne's Help to Buy scheme, which is really an adventure into sub-prime lending. If you can't meet a bank's demands for a deposit the government will help to bridge the gap by giving a guarantee for up to 20% of the mortgage on homes worth up to \u00a3600,000. Pitched as an appeal to an \"aspiration nation,\" this policy is partly born of the terror of offending the constituency called current homeowners. The most logical way to cure Britain's housing shortage would be to order the construction of more homes, let's say a million. But an increase in supply of that order would, in the absence of meaningful growth in wages and affordability, cause the value of the current houses to fall. Great for first-time buyers; not so good for attracting the votes of established owners. A serious fall in house prices would also risk creating a fresh round of provisions at major banks and mortgage providers. To date, lenders have escaped big residential-related losses because house prices have not collapsed. Since the peak the fall has been about 15% in real terms; the banks' big UK losses on property lending have mostly been on the commercial side. But another fall of 15% would cause heavy provisions. Thus Help to Buy is deemed the best policy in the locker if something must be done to make homes affordable for those without sufficient savings. In the short-term the dangers are probably not severe, especially if the government really is determined to liberalise planning laws (though believe that when you see it) and if it can exclude remortgaging and second homes from the subsidies (technically tricky, to judge by ministers' wishy-washy statements). In the long term though, creating government-backed mortgages to encourage high loan-to-value lending is plainly irresponsible. It risks an almighty crash on the day, admittedly far off, when interest rates rise. \"Had we been asked to design a policy that would guarantee maximum damage to the UK's long-term growth prospects and its fragile credit rating, this would be it,\" concluded thinktank Fathom Consulting. Fair comment. \u2022 Last July Peter Marks, chief executive of the Co-op, pledged to mount \"a real challenge to the status quo\" in the banking world. He had just secured an agreement to buy 632 branches from Lloyds at what appeared to be the knock-down price of \u00a3350m; Lloyds even agreed to underwrite the debt to fund the deal. Eight months on, Marks' real challenge is getting the deal out of the starting gate. \"We're trying to conclude this transaction in very difficult economic times,\" said Marks. \"That's what makes it more difficult. We're trying to establish what the risks are and to mitigate those risks.\" Put like that, it sounds as if Co-op is not remotely close to being able to sign on the dotted line. Instead, it seems to be struggling to raise the capital \u2013 perhaps as much as \u00a31bn is needed \u2013 to support a bigger banking operation. The life and savings business was sold this week, freeing up \u00a3200m, and general insurance is now on the block. Is this prize really worth the hassle? The Co-op is still digesting the Britannia Building Society, which was blamed for \u00a3370m of bad loan losses this week. Then there was \u00a3150m for PPI mis-selling and the same again for a writedown of the value of the IT systems. Add up that little collection, plus the decline in profits from the \"core\" banking operation, and the unit recorded a loss of \u00a3662m. The capital position is healthy but this does not look like a business capable of integrating those branches very soon. Marks is retiring in May, to be succeeded by ex-B&amp;Q man Euan Sutherland. The handover gives Co-op members the ideal opportunity to demand a review of the Lloyds plan. Ambition is a fine thing; over-ambition is not. \u2022 As Warren East announced his departure after 12 years as chief executive, there was a reminder of ARM Holdings' stunning achievement: 95% of the world's smartphones contain microchips designed by ARM and the company is now worth \u00a313bn. Great stuff, and a phenomenal investment for anyone who bought the shares at almost any point in the last decade. But the highest point for the shares was actually in 2000 when the price, albeit briefly, topped \u00a310. Don't blame ARM, which has done nothing wrong: pre-tax profits have risen from \u00a335m to \u00a3276m since the turn of the century. It was the madness of the dotcom era stock market, pricing ARM as if global domination had already been achieved. What were investors smoking back then?",

In the short-term the dangers are probably not severe, especially if the government really is determined to liberalise planning laws (though believe that when you see it) and if it can exclude remortgaging and second homes from the subsidies (technically tricky, to judge by ministers' wishy-washy statements).</p> <p>In the long term though, creating government-backed mortgages to encourage high loan-to-value lending is plainly irresponsible. It risks an almighty crash on the day, admittedly far off, when interest rates rise.</p> <p>\"Had we been asked to design a policy that would guarantee maximum damage to the UK's long-term growth prospects and its fragile credit rating, this would be it,\" concluded thinktank Fathom Consulting. Fair comment.</p> <p>\u2022 Last July Peter Marks, chief executive of the Co-op, pledged to mount \"a real challenge to the status quo\" in the banking world. He had just secured an agreement to buy 632 branches from Lloyds at what appeared to be the knock-down price of \u00a3350m; Lloyds even agreed to underwrite the debt to fund the deal.</p> <p>Eight months on, Marks' real challenge is getting the deal out of the starting gate. \"We're trying to conclude this transaction in very difficult economic times,\" said Marks. \"That's what makes it more difficult. We're trying to establish what the risks are and to mitigate those risks.\"</p> <p>Put like that, it sounds as if Co-op is not remotely close to being able to sign on the dotted line. Instead, it seems to be struggling to raise the capital \u2013 perhaps as much as \u00a31bn is needed \u2013 to support a bigger banking operation. The life and savings business was sold this week, freeing up \u00a3200m, and general insurance is now on the block.</p> <p>Is this prize really worth the hassle? The Co-op is still digesting the Britannia Building Society, which was blamed for \u00a3370m of bad loan losses this week. Then there was \u00a3150m for PPI mis-selling and the same again for a writedown of the value of the IT systems. Add up that little collection, plus the decline in profits from the \"core\" banking operation, and the unit recorded a loss of \u00a3662m. The capital position is healthy but this does not look like a business capable of integrating those branches very soon.</p> <p>Marks is retiring in May, to be succeeded by ex-B&amp;Q man Euan Sutherland. The handover gives Co-op members the ideal opportunity to demand a review of the Lloyds plan. Ambition is a fine thing; over-ambition is not.</p> <p>\u2022 As Warren East announced his departure after 12 years as chief executive, there was a reminder of ARM Holdings' stunning achievement: 95% of the world's smartphones contain microchips designed by ARM and the company is now worth \u00a313bn. Great stuff, and a phenomenal investment for anyone who bought the shares at almost any point in the last decade.</p> <p>But the highest point for the shares was actually in 2000 when the price, albeit briefly, topped \u00a310. Don't blame ARM, which has done nothing wrong: pre-tax profits have risen from \u00a335m to \u00a3276m since the turn of the century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-406187005\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/3/22/1363963266135/ARM-Holdings-share-price-006.jpg\" alt=\"ARM Holdings share price\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ARM Holdings share price.

From these ovens came the crockery that Captain Scott took on his ill-fated mission to the Antarctic in 1912. And in a sad tribute to local craftsmanship, the tableware survived the extreme cold, while the expedition team perished.</p> <p>Today Dale Hall is home to Steelite International, the UK's biggest producer of tableware, producing more than half a million pieces of crockery a week, destined for hotels, restaurants, cruise ships and other parts of the hospitality industry. Decades of decline have left Stoke's pottery industry vastly diminished from its heyday but Steelite and its peers got a boost in this week's budget when George Osborne announced ceramics would be exempt from the climate change levy \u2013 an energy tax on industry to subsidise renewable power.</p> <p>Steelite sends about 80% of its products to foreign markets, says Kevin Oakes, its chief executive, talking over the clink of crockery and the hum of air conditioners on the factory floor. \"I am relieved that the vast majority of our production goes overseas. We are seeing great growth in America, significant growth in new markets such as Russia and Asia. And customers in these overseas markets truly value 'Made in Britain'.\" Nonetheless \"Made in Britain\" is a slogan that has been ignored by successive governments over the years, only gaining favour as the credit crunch exposed a ruinous national dependency on financial services.</p> <p>So the chancellor's announcement has been gratefully received by an industry whose longterm slump has become even more pronounced in the latest downturn with the bankruptcy of great names such as Wedgwood, Spode and Royal Worcester. With Steelite's vast kilns running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at temperatures of 1260C, any fall in energy costs is welcome. \"It is not huge in terms of monetary value. What is of great significance is that the chancellor has recognised this industry,\" says Oakes. \"This industry is fighting back \u2026 there are many examples of companies prospering in this city. If Britain is going to recover it needs strong manufacturing to do so.\"</p> <p>Tristram Hunt, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, who lobbied hard for the tax break, said the move would help keep \"good and well-paid jobs\" in the city. And the MP suggests the pottery industry may be, at last, turning a corner. \"We have been through the worst of globalisation. And what is so interesting is that you see production regained from China, from Indonesia, because of rising energy costs. The wheel of globalisation is turning again and we are becoming more and more competitive.\"</p> <p>Karel Williams, professor of political economy at Manchester Business School, says the tax exemption is \"a step in the right direction\" from a government that he claims has been dazzled by whizz-bang industries such as aerospace and energy. \"The romance of the hi-tech industry has completely distracted people,\" he says. \"We have to pay attention not only to so-called 'industries of the future', but to the declining industries \u2026 and industries that are holding their own but simply don't figure on the radar.\" Treasury \"finagling of the detail\" is only part of the answer, he adds. The government needs \"a plan for the future of the pottery business \u2026 a plan constructed around the dynamic, successful businesses\".</p> <p>Such a project would look at the skills and infrastructure businesses need to thrive, he says, citing specialist producers such as Steelite, as well as design-led companies such as Portmeirion Group, whose fashionable tableware is a staple of modern wedding lists.</p> <p>Stoke's potteries will never be the same industry that employed more than 70,000 people in the 1950s, when the city's bottle kilns turned the skies black. It now employs just 7,000 workers. \"There are some things that aren't going to come back,\" says Williams. \"If you look at the kind of pottery you buy in Tesco or Sainsbury's \u2026 so many dinner plates for \u00a32. That is all going to be made in the far east, or wherever things are cheapest. But there is a substantial market for design where the industry is succeeding and can succeed some more.\"</p> <p>This is exactly the market that entrepreneur Reiko Kaneko is targeting. Kaneko, 30, moved out of London's east end last year to bring her business to the factories of Stoke. Operating out of a converted brick factory, Kaneko designs quirky tableware and delicate vases which are sold in department stores such as Selfridges. Working with five small factories in a two-mile radius from her studio door, Kaneko was attracted to Stoke's rich heritage to produce her Japanese-inspired designs. \"The bone china is beautifully white, it has a strength to it, it is chip resistant and translucent when it is held up to the light.\" She adds: \"And it is a lot easier to get on with everything here, with a whole industry built around ceramics. For logistics it just made sense to be up here.\"</p> <p>Back at Steelite, Oakes is also sounding optimistic about the future of the industry. Steelite, which employs 1,000 people, plans to extend its factory, creating 233 jobs, as it seeks to expand operations following its recent acquisition of Royal Crown Derby.</p> <p>Buying this 263-year old company, where a single gold-leaf plate can cost up to \u00a3400, is part of Steelite's bid to get into the luxury end of the business. \"It is an iconic brand \u2026 and we are looking to give it a worldwide stage,\" says Oakes.</p> <p>But not everyone thinks the \"march of the makers\" is advancing as quickly as it could. The government's budget shows an unhealthy preoccupation with housing rather than manufacturing, argues Williams, referring to the statement's central plank to generate \u00a3130bn of new mortgages.</p> <p>\"It is utterly absurd that the chancellor has taken downside risk on overvalued house prices in the UK. Why are we taking all these liabilities to prop up a consumerist society when we could be directing our state-owned banks to lend to our national industries such as the potteries?\"</p> <h2>Potted history</h2> <p>Fired in the furnaces of the industrial revolution and by canny businessmen such as Josiah Wedgwood, pottery became one of Britain's first great industries. One of Wedgwood's best customers was Catherine the Great, a dedicated follower of western fashion, who ordered a lavish 952-piece service decorated with scenes of British country life and a frog motif.</p> <p>A few years later queens and empresses poured their tea from fine bone china, first developed by local son Josiah Spode. His company became one of the few global brands of the nineteenth century, with people eating their dinners off its distinctive willow-patterned plates from Calgary to Canton \u2013 now better known as Guangzhou.</p> <p>The Potteries soon became equally well known for smoky industrial life, chronicled by novelist Arnold Bennett. Today some in Stoke-on-Trent are keen to keen to dispel the image of the lone potter at a wheel making a fancy teacup. \"It is not just pottery,\" says Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation. As well as tableware, the industry makes everything from bricks and roof tiles, to artificial hips and components for mobile phones and space rockets, she says.</p>",

Operating out of a converted brick factory, Kaneko designs quirky tableware and delicate vases which are sold in department stores such as Selfridges. Working with five small factories in a two-mile radius from her studio door, Kaneko was attracted to Stoke's rich heritage to produce her Japanese-inspired designs. \"The bone china is beautifully white, it has a strength to it, it is chip resistant and translucent when it is held up to the light.\" She adds: \"And it is a lot easier to get on with everything here, with a whole industry built around ceramics. For logistics it just made sense to be up here.\" Back at Steelite, Oakes is also sounding optimistic about the future of the industry. Steelite, which employs 1,000 people, plans to extend its factory, creating 233 jobs, as it seeks to expand operations following its recent acquisition of Royal Crown Derby. Buying this 263-year old company, where a single gold-leaf plate can cost up to \u00a3400, is part of Steelite's bid to get into the luxury end of the business. \"It is an iconic brand \u2026 and we are looking to give it a worldwide stage,\" says Oakes. But not everyone thinks the \"march of the makers\" is advancing as quickly as it could. The government's budget shows an unhealthy preoccupation with housing rather than manufacturing, argues Williams, referring to the statement's central plank to generate \u00a3130bn of new mortgages. \"It is utterly absurd that the chancellor has taken downside risk on overvalued house prices in the UK. Why are we taking all these liabilities to prop up a consumerist society when we could be directing our state-owned banks to lend to our national industries such as the potteries?\" Potted history Fired in the furnaces of the industrial revolution and by canny businessmen such as Josiah Wedgwood, pottery became one of Britain's first great industries. One of Wedgwood's best customers was Catherine the Great, a dedicated follower of western fashion, who ordered a lavish 952-piece service decorated with scenes of British country life and a frog motif. A few years later queens and empresses poured their tea from fine bone china, first developed by local son Josiah Spode. His company became one of the few global brands of the nineteenth century, with people eating their dinners off its distinctive willow-patterned plates from Calgary to Canton \u2013 now better known as Guangzhou. The Potteries soon became equally well known for smoky industrial life, chronicled by novelist Arnold Bennett. Today some in Stoke-on-Trent are keen to keen to dispel the image of the lone potter at a wheel making a fancy teacup. \"It is not just pottery,\" says Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation. As well as tableware, the industry makes everything from bricks and roof tiles, to artificial hips and components for mobile phones and space rockets, she says.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Labour's attempt to woo the small business vote stepped up a gear on Friday when the shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna raised the prospect of automatic sanctions for big companies that fail to pay their suppliers on time. Umunna said the UK's late-payment culture was \"outrageous\" and warned that a future Labour government would consider banning firms from public contracts under a tough new sanctions regime. The shadow business secretary outlined action against late payment in a series of measures announced to the annual conference of the Federation of Small Businesses. \"Too many small businesses are effectively bankrolling bigger businesses that refuse to pay them on time. This is outrageous,\" Umunna said. \"In government we legislated so that late payments can incur interest, and we established the prompt payment code. But I know how hard it can be to challenge your own customers. \"So, the next Labour government will expose those who pay late and we will seek to put in place a regime that will automatically trigger action against late payers, perhaps by preventing them winning public contracts and through reporting requirements on payment performance in their company accounts.\" As part of its attempt to build bridges with small- and medium-sized businesses, Umunna said he would set up a US-style government agency to make sure the perspectives of SMEs were seen in Whitehall. In addition, he said a future Labour government would crack down on energy companies that \"ripped off\" small businesses, giving firms the same sort of protection as currently provided for domestic consumers. Energy suppliers would be banned from putting businesses on more expensive tariffs without their consent and firms that fell into arrears would have to be given time to pay. Umunna also announced that Camden council in London would be the pilot for a peer-to-peer lending scheme, under which local authorities would invest in businesses in their own area. \"Our new approach to small business, which reflects the changing nature of small business, is why today I say I believe there is very strong case for the establishment of a small business agency, along the lines of the small business administration in the US,\" Umunna said. \"I have met senior SBA officials several times and believe an equivalent agency could be set up here under the auspices of the business department to drive a small business agenda across the whole of government.\"",

      "body": "<p>Labour's attempt to woo the small business vote stepped up a gear on Friday when the shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna raised the prospect of automatic sanctions for big companies that fail to pay their suppliers on time.</p> <p>Umunna said the UK's late-payment culture was \"outrageous\" and warned that a future Labour government would consider banning firms from public contracts under a tough new sanctions regime.</p> <p>The shadow business secretary outlined action against late payment in a series of measures announced to the annual conference of the Federation of Small Businesses.</p> <p>\"Too many small businesses are effectively bankrolling bigger businesses that refuse to pay them on time. This is outrageous,\" Umunna said.</p> <p>\"In government we legislated so that late payments can incur interest, and we established the prompt payment code. But I know how hard it can be to challenge your own customers.</p> <p>\"So, the next Labour government will expose those who pay late and we will seek to put in place a regime that will automatically trigger action against late payers, perhaps by preventing them winning public contracts and through reporting requirements on payment performance in their company accounts.\"</p> <p>As part of its attempt to build bridges with small- and medium-sized businesses, Umunna said he would set up a US-style government agency to make sure the perspectives of SMEs were seen in Whitehall.</p> <p>In addition, he said a future Labour government would crack down on energy companies that \"ripped off\" small businesses, giving firms the same sort of protection as currently provided for domestic consumers. Energy suppliers would be banned from putting businesses on more expensive tariffs without their consent and firms that fell into arrears would have to be given time to pay.</p> <p>Umunna also announced that Camden council in London would be the pilot for a peer-to-peer lending scheme, under which local authorities would invest in businesses in their own area.</p> <p>\"Our new approach to small business, which reflects the changing nature of small business, is why today I say I believe there is very strong case for the establishment of a small business agency, along the lines of the small business administration in the US,\" Umunna said. \"I have met senior SBA officials several times and believe an equivalent agency could be set up here under the auspices of the business department to drive a small business agenda across the whole of government.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne was served notice on Friday night that the UK's AAA credit status will be downgraded for a second time when ratings agency Fitch said Britain's lack of growth and rising debt mountain meant there was a \"heightened probability of a downgrade in the near term\". Delivering its verdict on this week's budget, Fitch said it was writing a report, due in April, that analysts said is almost certain to strip the UK of the second of its three AAA ratings. Fitch said the notice of a possible downgrade reflected \"the latest economic and fiscal forecasts published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that indicate that UK government debt will peak later and at a higher level than previously expected by Fitch\". The government will find out in April whether the economy suffered an unprecedented triple-dip recession. In the last three months of 2012 the economy shrank 0.3%. A second straight quarter of negative growth could undermine faltering business confidence and choke off the first signs of a recovery. Figures from the Office for National Statistics are expected to show the UK narrowly avoided a third contraction since the banking crash of 2008, but recent surveys have shown key industries, including manufacturing and construction, slipping back. Several analysts said even without a triple-dip recession the worsening economic situation made further credit downgrades inevitable. In documents that accompanied the budget, the OBR said that a lack of growth and lower than expected tax receipts had worsened the economic outlook and delayed the recovery until after the next election. It halved the forecast for growth this year to 0.6% and said the debt-to-GDP ratio would peak at 85%. But Fitch said a tougher measure of the UK's debt burden showed the debt pile would exceed 100% of annual national income before it begins to fall, which makes situation more perilous. While it credited the UK with having a \"high-income, diversified and flexible economy\", it said the last four years of low growth had damaged the economy. It said: \"The persistently weak performance of UK growth, in part due to European growth, has increased uncertainty around the UK's potential output and longer-term trend rate of growth with significant implications for public finances.\" Last month Moody's stunned the chancellor when it became the first agency to kick Britain out of the exclusive AAA club, which still includes Germany, Canada and Switzerland. The Treasury has argued that the downgrade shows the UK needs to cut public expenditure to get on top of its debts. Labour responded that the downgrades were the result of an austerity-first policy that failed to generate growth. Chris Leslie, the shadow Treasury minister, said: \"This is yet another blow to a downgraded chancellor who made keeping the confidence of the credit rating agencies the No 1 test of his economic policy. What really matters are the economic realities which Fitch are responding to including, as their statement says, 'the persistently weak performance of UK growth'. \"George Osborne's plan has catastrophically failed on growth, living standards and the deficit.

      "body": "<p>A week of stock market losses caused by Cyprus taking pole position in the eurozone crisis came to an end - just.</p> <p>Hopes of a deal to save the Mediterranean island from financial collapse, along with significant rises by a number of blue-chip UK companies, combined to stop the slide.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished at 6392.76 yesterday, up 4.21 points on the day but down 96 points on the week, its worst seven day performance since the middle of November. Markets have been rattled by the chaos in Cyprus, which is struggling to fill a \u20ac5.8bn funding shortfall to allow it to receive an EU bailout - with a deadline of Monday set by the European Central Bank. George Osborne's Budget on Wednesday had little impact despite its gloomy outlook, while a late warning of a UK downgrade from ratings agency Fitch came too late to affect sentiment. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> These are worrying times for the eurozone, but due to Cyprus's size investors are not quite in panic mode yet and we've seen in the past that when the pressure is really applied some sort of deal is cobbled together by politicians, giving the euro and investors yet another lifeline. </blockquote> <p>Leading the FTSE 100 higher yesterday was <strong>BT</strong>, up 10.4p to 276.7p as Nomura raised its price target from 290p to 360p:</p> <blockquote> We think positive news flow from BT's imminent restructuring plan, confirmation of the European Commission's broadband plan [on indexed pricing] and a solid launch of BT Sport (against low expectations) will override noise <br>on union wage negotiations and the widening of the pension deficit. </blockquote> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> added 103p to \u00a332.36 after Thursday's strategy update by new chief executive Pascal Soriot. In typical fashion, the City welcomed news of 2,300 jobs to go in sales and administration, following a cull of 1,600 posts in research and development announced on Monday. Analyst Peter Verdult at Morgan Stanley said:</p> <blockquote> While expectations were low, we believe management has gained incremental credibility regarding its plans to reshape R&amp;D, and return AstraZeneca to growth. We are getting more constructive on the shares, given an attractive long-term risk-reward profile and supportive yield. </blockquote> <p>Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon kept his hold rating on the shares:</p> <blockquote> The company's strategy review contained a number of themes which we believe will improve sentiment in the long run, but overall we believe the company will struggle to break out and we will continue to advocate taking profits when the share price reaches our price target of \u00a332. Essentially the theme of the meeting was one of building up hope on the pipeline as well as hinting at consensus forecasts which the company believes to be too pessimistic. We want to believe but we have been here before with this stock and it's only two months since the company withdrew its previous mid-term guidance which, at the point of setting, was also underpinned by pipeline and impossibly low consensus. That did not work out and we continue to believe investors will remain circumspect on prospects. <br> </blockquote> <p>With AstraZeneca suggesting it would focus on rebuilding rather than acquisitive growth, one of its supposed bid targets, <strong>Shire</strong>, slipped 19p to \u00a319.78.</p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> was lifted early in the week by speculation of a possible \u00a38bn bid from Qatar, although this was later dismissed. The retailer closed at 397.6p, up 7.6p on the day as Societe Generale lifted its price target from 445p to 468p.</p> <p><strong>National Grid</strong> rose 10p to 753.5p after HSBC moved its recommendation from neutral to overweight and raised its price target from 780p to 850p. The bank said that Grid had put sufficient financing in place to benefit from proposed UK expansion plans:</p> <blockquote> National Grid has an accelerated investment programme in transmission and gas distribution in the UK over the next eight years. Its regulated, capital-intensive business lacks commodity and demand volatility, and the political exposure of energy supply in the UK. Investor concerns about the funding of this programme and its ability to maintain and grow dividends have been mitigated by its \u00a32bn hybrid bond issue. The \u00a31bn equity credit allowed by the rating agencies eases credit metrics. National Grid is now, as a whole, financially stable. </blockquote> <p>The upgrade came as the closure of a pipeline linking Britain and Europe led to a jump in wholesale gas prices. Meanwhile <strong>SSE</strong>, which on Thursday <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/21/gas-price-warning-short-supplies?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">warned of Britain's lights possibly going out as it cut back capacity due to rising costs</a>, slipped 2p to \u00a314.86 after the bank said:</p> <blockquote> We downgrade SSE to underweight [from neutral] after its strong share price performance given current uncertainties in UK generation. <br> </blockquote> <p>But British Gas owner <strong>Centrica</strong> climbed 5.1p to 357.6p after HSBC repeated its overweight rating and 400p target.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> rose 8.3p to 457.7p after it announced an $8bn share buyback programme following the sale of its stake in TNK-BP to Russian firm Rosneft.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong>, down 9p at 285.3p, disappointed investors on Wednesday with a higher than expected $1.5bn impairment charge relating to weak aluminium prices, as well as scrapping its final dividend.</p> <p><strong>Burberry</strong> dropped 57p to \u00a313.30 after a profit warning from luxury handbag maker <strong>Mulberry</strong>, down 17% to \u00a310.24.
