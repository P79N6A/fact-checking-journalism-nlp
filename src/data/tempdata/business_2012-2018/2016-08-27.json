      "bodyText": "BHS will close the doors on its last 22 stores for the final time on Sunday, 88 years after the retailer opened for business as an affordable general store in Brixton. When it has packed up what\u2019s left on the racks of slippers, cardigans and dresses aimed at value-conscious shoppers, the last of the department store\u2019s once 11,000-strong workforce will be made redundant. By summer bank holiday Monday, they will be jobless. As they pick up final pay cheques, some will no doubt be pondering the role of former owner Sir Philip Green \u2013 currently luxuriating off the coast of Italy on his brand new \u00a3100m super yacht \u2013 in their predicament. Most will be hoping that Green will honour his promise to \u201csort\u201d the BHS pension fund, currently more than \u00a3571m in deficit and heading for the pensions lifeboat, meaning that members will have to take a 10% cut in the benefits they had expected. But it\u2019s not only the staff who will be left high and dry by the collapse of BHS, which went into administration in April, little more than a year after Green sold the 170 stores for \u00a31 to a group of inexperienced and unknown entrepreneurs led by former bankrupt Dominic Chappell. The demise of the department store, the biggest retail failure since Woolworths in 2009, will leave gaping holes in struggling high streets and shopping centres across the country where the department store\u2019s large shops were once a major draw. Many communities will be hoping that the end of BHS will mark a chance for revival as its neglected and now dowdy stores have a chance of being replaced by more vital and fashionable brands. Some locals \u2013 in towns like Romford \u2013 are actively campaigning to attract chains like John Lewis, Primark or Zara. Primark and Sports Direct are expected to take a handful of stores each, while Zara, Poundworld, Wilko and H&amp;M are all in talks to take a few outlets. Ikea, Decathlon, Dunelm and Go Outdoors may also use former BHS sites as a chance to experiment with smaller high-street ventures. It\u2019s not clear if the BHS brand will disappear altogether from the UK. The online store, which was bought by a Qatari firm, along with the BHS brand name and international business, currently says it will be reopening for business this autumn. Property firms Savills and CBRE, which are advising on the BHS disposals, are thought to have concluded deals on about a quarter of the sites. Administrator Duff &amp; Phelps recovered at least \u00a322.5m from landlords by surrendering the leases on BHS\u2019s Manchester, Brighton and Milton Keynes stores to their landlords, according to trade journal Estates Gazette. Primark is already trading in the former BHS store in Fosse Park, Leicester, and has confirmed it will be moving into the Llandudno site. BHS\u2019s flagship Oxford Street store in London will be converted into the first outlet for Polish retailer Lubianiec Piechocki i Partnerzy (LPP). But property experts believe that it could take years for some BHS branches to find new occupiers. It took about three years for the majority of Woolworths\u2019 800 stores to find new occupiers after it went bust, according to independent retail consultant Graham Soult, who has toured the country cataloguing the fate of the chain\u2019s outlets. About four, including the one on Margate high street, are still empty seven years on. Soult points out things are likely to be more difficult for BHS, partly because of the large size of its branches but also as a result of a tougher business climate in which retailers are closing stores as shoppers switch to buying online. He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s also tougher partly because of Woolworths\u2019 demise. Many retailers used that to plug the gaps in their portfolio.\u201d Will Thomas of retail property consultancy KLM believes 15% to 20% \u2013 or about 33 BHS stores \u2013 are likely to be very difficult to shift. \u201cIt is quite an obsolete portfolio. BHS hasn\u2019t really kept up with the fashions and retail pitches have moved away from its stores. In many locations, it is really the last store in town and not attractive to many,\u201d he says. More than a decade of underinvestment means that many branches will require major refurbishment, including the removal of asbestos, which could cost up to \u00a3500,000 per store. With little demand for the average 45,000sq ft stores BHS occupied, many branches are likely to be divided up in the same way that former C&amp;A outlets were split to house shops including Zara, Primark and New Look. Extensive upper floors, once used for stock rooms, staff canteens and managers\u2019 offices, are likely to be even trickier to deal with. Most retailers are now more efficient and don\u2019t need such large backroom areas, so upper floors may have to be redeveloped as gyms, homes or separate office space. That\u2019s not so attractive for local authorities, which receive much lower business rates from such uses, according to Thomas. But he says: \u201cThese stores are just too big for most retailers\u2019 requirements.\u201d At least one former BHS \u2013 Ealing \u2013 has already been sold for redevelopment into residential properties in a controversial \u00a310m deal involving former owner Green\u2019s son-in-law, Brett Palos. Even if stores do find new retail occupants, that offers little hope for BHS staff being laid off this weekend. If the business had been sold as a going concern, they could have transferred to the new owners and stayed in work. Now they must hit the jobcentre. John Hannett, general secretary of shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw, says: \u201cThis weekend marks the end of BHS, as the remaining staff go through the difficult and heartbreaking task of dismantling stores that many of them have been in for most of their working lives. Wherever the blame lies for the demise of this once great British retailer, it certainly is not with the staff, who are paying a high price for corporate decisions that have led us to where we are today. \u201cSir Philip Green needs to honour the two promises he made to BHS staff and pensioners after the company went into administration. Firstly, to offer employment within the Arcadia Group to the blameless, dedicated and loyal staff who suddenly find themselves unemployed. Secondly, to \u2018sort\u2019 the pension scheme. We are stilling waiting to hear the details of what he proposes.\u201d KEY PLAYERS Sir Philip Green The billionaire former owner of BHS is currently on his new 295ft yacht Lionheart off the coast of Italy. He\u2019s still in discussions with the pension regulator about his potential contribution to the \u00a3571m pension deficit, most of which was built up during his tenure. Two weeks ago, the billionaire reacted angrily when a Sky News reporter took a water taxi out to his yacht \u2013 which was then moored off the Greek coast \u2013 to ask questions about BHS. He refused to answer and later, in port, threatened to call the police, lunged for the camera and shouted: \u201cThat\u2019s going in the fucking sea.\u201d Darren Topp The former BHS chief executive is currently on a cycling holiday in the UK after finishing assisting administrators at the end of June. Topp, who told MPs that Chappell had threatened to kill him after he accused the entrepreneur of theft from the company, says he is taking time out before looking for a new job. Lord Grabiner The former chairman of Green\u2019s Arcadia Group was described by MPs as the \u201capogee of weak corporate governance\u201d. He is still a working QC and was recently involved in Guys Hands\u2019s abandoned \u00a31.5bn lawsuit against Citigroup over the ill-fated \u00a34.2bn takeover of EMI.",

    "webTitle": "Dominic Chappell to wind up company involved in BHS acquisition", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, is planning to put his personal business into administration this week and is restructuring his assets, meaning he could walk away from a substantial tax bill and protect his cash from investigations into the demise of the department store chain. Chappell has lined up David Rubin &amp; Partners as the administrator for Swiss Rock Ltd. The firm could be appointed as early as this week. Swiss Rock was paid at least \u00a31.6m by BHS and its parent company as part of Chappell\u2019s controversial acquisition of the retailer. By putting Swiss Rock into administration, Chappell could walk away from its debts, which are thought to include a tax bill on his earnings from BHS. Chappell\u2019s actions will further infuriate BHS staff. The last of BHS\u2019s 164 stores will close this weekend after the retail chain collapsed into administration in April, 13 months after it was bought by Chappell\u2019s consortium. The demise of the retailer has led to 11,000 job losses and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. However, Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, received at least \u00a317m from BHS during its ownership of the retailer. Chappell and his associates were labelled as \u201cincompetent and self-serving\u201d by the parliamentary committee that investigated the failure of BHS. MPs said Chappell \u201chad his hands in the till\u201d and helped to oversee the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of BHS. As well as lining up administrators for Swiss Rock, Chappell has moved his family home in Dorset out of a \u00a31.5m loan that was handed over by Retail Acquisitions using cash from BHS. The security on the loan has been switched from the Chappell family home to a property in Portugal, and Land Registry documents no longer list Retail Acquisitions as the lender on the Chappells\u2019 property. The Guardian revealed last week that the home was on the brink of repossession before the \u00a31.5m loan from Retail Acquisitions was used to pay off debts against it. In addition, the shares in JDM Island Properties, the company that owns the Chappells\u2019 home, have been switched from Colin Sutton, an accountant and friend of the family, to Olivia Investments, the Chappell family\u2019s Gibraltar-based investment fund. These actions could distance the property from the administrators and investigators trying to recover cash for BHS. The Chappell family home now has no connection to Retail Acquisitions or BHS, so if the \u00a31.5m is ordered to be repaid, then the property cannot be claimed instead. Chappell confirmed to the Observer that Swiss Rock was likely to go into administration next week. \u201cIt is a company that we are no longer using. It was very connected with the acquisition of BHS,\u201d Chappell said. However, Chappell refused to deny that Swiss Rock would be leaving unpaid debts, including a tax bill. \u201cI am not prepared to go into anything at the moment until we have gone into the detail,\u201d he added. He also declined to say why he was moving the properties around. \u201cI am not making any comment on that. It is confidential and private.\u201d Chappell said he would make a written response to the MPs report into the BHS controversy this week. He told ITV in a television interview that he been \u201cstitched up\u201d by Sir Philip Green when the billionaire tycoon sold BHS to Retail Acquisitions because Green did not deliver on promises to fix the deficit in the BHS pension scheme or ensure that suppliers supported the new owners. Chappell also insisted he would not return any of the money he banked from BHS, which was more than \u00a34m including the \u00a31.5m loan. \u201cI earned that money,\u201d he said. The Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator are both investigating the former owner of BHS. The Serious Fraud Office is also considering whether to launch a formal investigation. However, Chappell insisted he had behaved correctly. He added: \u201cMy conscience is very clear, that we did the right thing, right the way through.\u201d",

The demise of the retailer has led to 11,000 job losses and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. However, Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, received at least \u00a317m from BHS during its ownership of the retailer.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/jul/25/breaking-it-down-philip-green-and-bhs-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4p6k4\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2622757\"            data-video-name=\"Breaking it down: Philip Green and BHS \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57963c63e4b01845934fe687\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/07/25/160725PhilipGreenDab_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/07/25/160725PhilipGreenDab_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/07/25/160725PhilipGreenDab.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/07/25/160725PhilipGreenDab_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/07/25/160725PhilipGreenDab_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2016/jul/25/breaking-it-down-philip-green-and-bhs-video\">Breaking it down: Philip Green and BHS</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Chappell and his associates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-collapse-key-players-mps-report-sir-philip-green\">were labelled as \u201cincompetent and self-serving\u201d </a>by the parliamentary committee that investigated the failure of BHS. MPs said Chappell \u201chad his hands in the till\u201d and helped to oversee the \u201csystematic plunder\u201d of BHS.</p> <p>As well as lining up administrators for Swiss Rock, Chappell has moved his family home in Dorset out of a \u00a31.5m loan that was handed over by Retail Acquisitions using cash from BHS.</p> <p>The security on the loan has been switched from the Chappell family home to a property in Portugal, and Land Registry documents no longer list Retail Acquisitions as the lender on the Chappells\u2019 property. The <em>Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/21/dominic-chappell-used-15m-bhs-loan-to-pay-off-family-mortgage\">revealed last week</a> that the home was on the brink of repossession before the \u00a31.5m loan from Retail Acquisitions was used to pay off debts against it.</p> <p>In addition, the shares in JDM Island Properties, the company that owns the Chappells\u2019 home, have been switched from Colin Sutton, an accountant and friend of the family, to Olivia Investments, the Chappell family\u2019s Gibraltar-based investment fund.</p> <p>These actions could distance the property from the administrators and investigators trying to recover cash for BHS. The Chappell family home now has no connection to Retail Acquisitions or BHS, so if the \u00a31.5m is ordered to be repaid, then the property cannot be claimed instead.</p> <p>Chappell confirmed to the<em> Observer </em>that Swiss Rock was likely to go into administration next week. \u201cIt is a company that we are no longer using. It was very connected with the acquisition of BHS,\u201d Chappell said.</p> <p>However, Chappell refused to deny that Swiss Rock would be leaving unpaid debts, including a tax bill. \u201cI am not prepared to go into anything at the moment until we have gone into the detail,\u201d he added.</p> <p>He also declined to say why he was moving the properties around. \u201cI am not making any comment on that. It is confidential and private.\u201d</p> <p>Chappell said he would make a written response to the MPs report into the BHS controversy this week.</p> <p>He told ITV in a television interview that he been \u201cstitched up\u201d by Sir Philip Green when the billionaire tycoon sold BHS to Retail Acquisitions because Green did not deliver on promises to fix the deficit in the BHS pension scheme or ensure that suppliers supported the new owners.</p> <p>Chappell also insisted he would not return any of the money he banked from BHS, which was more than \u00a34m including the \u00a31.5m loan. \u201cI earned that money,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator are both investigating the former owner of BHS. The Serious Fraud Office is also considering whether to launch a formal investigation.</p> <p>However, Chappell insisted he had behaved correctly. He added: \u201cMy conscience is very clear, that we did the right thing, right the way through.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "Mylan CEO sold $5m worth of stock while EpiPen price drew scrutiny", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Heather Bresch, the CEO at the center of EpiPen\u2019s 471% price hike, sold 100,200 of her shares earlier this month and earned more than $5m from the sale. The transaction took place on 9 August, the same day Mylan \u2013 the drugmaker that manufactures EpiPen \u2013 released its most recent earnings report. Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin told the Guardian that the sale was \u201cpart of a 10b5 plan\u201d. Typically, executives and directors of public companies who want to sell their stock establish a written 10b5 plan to do so. Most of 10b5 plans include a waiting period spanning days or weeks to avoid any suspicion of trading based on material non-public information. Simply put, 10b5 plans are used to avoid being suspected of insider trading. Yet Bresch did not need insider information to know that trouble lay ahead. Early in June, Wells Fargo analyst David Maris put together a report detailing that since the beginning of this year, Mylan raised the prices of seven of its products by 100% or more and 24 products by 20% or more. At the time, Devlin called the report \u201cflawed\u201d. The report came months after Marti Shkreli, former chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, increased prices of HIV medicine Daraprim 5,000%. In his attempts to defend the decision, Shkreli become notorious and was even summoned before the US Congress to justify the price hike. As a result, in June, Maris of Wells Fargo noted that price hikes could lead to similar trouble for Mylan. \u201cWe believe that given the regulatory environment, these pricing actions could bring greater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk,\u201d he wrote in his analyst note. The price hikes of Mylan\u2019s products were covered by media outlets such as CNBC, Bloomberg and FiercePharma. Bloomberg had also previously published a feature in September 2015 detailing how Bresch had made EpiPen into a marketing success and increased its price 400%. Over the past 12 months, price of EpiPen was hiked twice more, going up 15% each time. The last of the hikes took place after the Bloomberg story was published. Overall, since Mylan acquired Merck KGaA \u2013 the maker of EpiPen and 400 other products \u2013 its price had gone up 461%. On 8 July, Slate ran a story with the headline: \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no reason why an EpiPen should cost $300\u201d. EpiPens are usually sold in packs of two for more than $600. A month after Slate\u2019s story was published, Bresch sold 100,200 of her shares. The transaction took place just weeks before more coverage of the EpiPen price hike caused the Mylan share price to drop from $49 on 18 August to $42.91 on 26 August. Bresch also received a 671% pay increase over the past nine years. She still holds 828,318 shares of Mylan. The trouble for Mylan is far from over. Earlier this week, Bresch was invited to testify before the US Senate to explain the price hike. Sarah Jessica Parker, the actor best known for Sex and the City, terminated her relationship with Mylan. Parker was previously a spokeswoman for the company, helping increase awareness of anaphylaxis \u2013 an allergic reaction that causes one\u2019s airways to swell and close. EpiPen quickly delivers a proper dose of epinephrine to those suffering from anaphylaxis. Similarly to Parker, Kelly Rudnicki was a paid spokeswoman for Mylan until she resigned this past Wednesday . For days, she was reading about the issue trying to make a decision. \u201cThere is absolutely no way that I could align myself with a company that is really not taking care of its consumers,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cIt was a very easy decision for me to make once I came to that conclusion.\u201d Rudnicki was working with Mylan for about two years, but had been a food allergy advocate and blogger for about 10 years. When she first heard that the company had increased EpiPen prices by 461%, she said she \u201cfelt like I was punched in the gut. I felt betrayed\u201d. \u201cI believe the CEO must step down,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce that trust is broken, she really cannot lead this company.\u201d A mother of an allergic child, Rudnicki has been buying EpiPens for the past 13 years. Since she has a high deductible, sometimes they would be covered by insurance and sometimes they were not. There is no justification for the high prices, she said. On Thursday morning, Bresch went on CNBC and in an interview said that one of the reasons why Mylan hiked EpiPen prices was because of the US healthcare system. \u201cI am hoping that this is an inflection point for this country,\u201d she said. \u201cOur healthcare is in crisis. It\u2019s no different than the mortgage financial crisis back in 2007.\u201d According to Bresch , the price is that much higher because it has to pass through four or five \u201chands\u201d such as retailers and pharmacy benefit managers before it gets to the patient at the counter. \u201cWhat Mylan takes from that, our net sales is $274, so $137 per pen,\u201d she said. As a result, on Thursday, Mylan announced that in addition to issuing $300 savings cards for consumers in need, it was also going to start selling EpiPens directly to consumers. Rudnicki said that coupons and other financial are essentially just a \u201cBand Aid\u201d for a very serious situation and that the company should decrease its prices. Tyrone Gayle, spokesman for the Clinton campaign, also called on the company to \u201cimmediately lower the overall price of EpiPens\u201d. \u201cDiscounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of EpiPens are insufficient, because the excessive price will likely be passed on through higher insurance premiums,\u201d he said.",
