      "bodyText": "US drug firm Pfizer has admitted that its proposed \u00a363bn takeover of UK rival AstraZeneca would lead to job cuts and a big reduction in the combined companies' research and development spending. Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, who was facing questions from MPs on the first of two days of parliamentary hearings into the planned takeover, said that \"there will be some job cuts\" despite repeated assurances that the takeover would be \"win-win\" for the UK. Read eventually conceded the combined R&amp;D budget of the two businesses would be reduced after Labour's Adrian Bailey, chairman of the business select committee, told him that Pfizer was known as a \"praying mantis\" and \"a shark that needs feeding\". Read said there would be redundancies around the world, but refused to say where: \"I'm not sitting here saying that we can become more efficient without some reduction in jobs. What I can't tell you is how much or how many or where.\" The only guarantee that the Scotland-born Read was prepared to give was Pfizer's previously made pledge that 20% of the combined R&amp;D workforce would be based in Britain for the next five years. \"That's a substantial commitment,\" he said. \"I intend to honour those commitments \u2026 I'm a man of my word. \"Once the deal is completed, we will look at the global spend and decide where is the best place for science, and the UK has a great science infrastructure.\" David Cameron has made it clear he wants to see better guarantees from Pfizer, and the business secretary, Vince Cable, has refused to rule out intervention in the bid, while admitting it would be \"tricky\". Cable also appeared before the MPs and said Read's pledges must be more specific. \"The key issue is that they would have to be meaningful and binding,\" he said. Pfizer has previously made cost savings when deals have been completed. After its three previous big acquisitions \u2013 US firms Wyeth and Warner-Lambert and Sweden's Pharmacia \u2013 there were laboratory closures and more than 60,000 job losses. AstraZeneca has repeatedly rejected Pfizer's offers as significantly undervaluing the company. The UK firm's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, told MPs on Tuesday that the proposed deal risked disrupting or delaying the development of life-saving drugs. \"In research, big is not necessarily beautiful,\" he said. He told the committee: \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed \u2013 and essentially was delayed because, in the meantime, our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?\" But on Tuesday night he told BBC Newsnight he was not ruling out recommending a deal. \"We will consider proposals, offers that are made to us in the context of the value, the price that's offered and the potential of the terms,\" he said. \"But certainly the price that is offered is a very important dimension.\" Read refused to make a longer-term commitment despite warnings from leading scientists. Paul Nurse, the president of the Royal Society, said in a letter to the committee that Pfizer must make a 10-year commitment to the UK. Unions representing AstraZeneca's 6,700 UK staff told the hearing Pfizer's five-year pledge was \"paper thin\" and \"remarkably short-term\". They want a 25-year pledge. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the Pfizer comments \"reinforced Labour's grave concerns about this potential takeover and confirmed the worst fears of the British business and science community about its impact\". Read, however, said Britain should welcome the opportunity to have the world's largest pharmaceutical company relocate its tax base to the UK. He said it would be very beneficial to the Exchequer, even though the substantial tax benefits would come at the expense of US taxpayers. The company will make big tax savings by spending the \u00a340bn cash pile it has built up outside the US on buying AstraZeneca rather than taking the money back to America. If the cash was repatriated to the US, it would be taxed at 27%, compared with 20% in the UK from next year. While Pfizer finance chief Frank D'Amelio declined to spell out the likely tax savings, but said the New York-based pharma giant would not relocate to the UK without the AstraZeneca deal (US rules require for \"tax inversion\" that at least 20% of the company is in non-US ownership). The contentious tax plans have been attacked in the US, by prominent senators Carl Levin and Roy Wyden, who are working to close the loophole. Read made clear that tax savings were one of the main drivers of the proposed deal. \"We would change the price we are offering if we didn't have the advantage of the tax,\" he said. He highlighted the UK's \"patent box\", introduced by chancellor George Osborne, which allows companies to pay just 10% tax on products derived from UK research. Soriot warned that Pfizer's proposed tax inversion could generate substantial controversy and \"potentially impact the reputation of our company\". However, it emerged later in the hearing that AstraZeneca paid no corporate taxes last year because its operations in the UK made a loss. \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed - and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?\" The French-born Australian also warned that Pfizer's proposed tax inversion could generate substantial controversy and \"potentially impact the reputation of our company\". It then emerged that while AstraZeneca paid corporate taxes of \u00a31.5bn in the last five years (plus \u00a31bn in employee taxes), it paid none last year, because its operations in the UK made a loss. Away from the hearings, Pfizer made a direct appeal to shareholders that it should be allowed to buy the British firm. In a statement to the City, Pfizer said it \"remains disappointed at the lack of engagement by the AstraZeneca board\". AstraZeneca dismissed Pfizer's statement and Soriot told MPs that his company was better off alone: \"We have the scale, we have the people, we have the talent, we have the products, we are confident we can succeed.\" However, after the hearing, he indicated that AstraZeneca's board would be open to a deal if Pfizer substantially increased its offer. The US group is widely expected to raise its proposal above the current \u00a350-a-share offer. Heads you 'own it' Ian Read, the Scottish-born accountant who runs the biggest drug firm in the US carries in his pocket a special gold coin, about the size and weight of a \u00a32 piece. On one side it reads \"Straight talk\", the other says \"Own it\". The Pfizer boss told bemused MPs the coin is a symbol of Pfizer's corporate culture. If someone in the company wants to have a direct conversation, they flash the coin. \"I believe strongly that everybody in the company needs to have a sense of ownership\", he explained. \"Hence \"own it\", and to own it we need the ability to do straight talk.\" Tory MP Brian Binley, who asked Read to produce the coin, then delivered some straight talk of his own, telling Read he hadn't been straight enough with the committee. \"I believe you spun it this morning and got 'Own it'. We haven't had the straight talk we need,\" he said.",

The study by accounting group KPMG follows warnings from politicians and British scientists that the UK's science base would be further sapped if Pfizer's proposed takeover of AstraZeneca goes ahead. KPMG said foreign ownership of UK manufacturers was limiting R&amp;D budgets in Britain because investment in this area tended to made in the parent companies' home countries. John Leech, head of automotive at KPMG in the UK, said: \"Our report highlights that the UK has slipped behind our peers in R&amp;D spending which brings the current proposed acquisition of AstraZeneca by Pfizer into sharper focus. The UK manufacturers are typically overseas owned and these companies tend to spend more of their R&amp;D in their home countries rather than in the UK. The problem is we don't have many AstraZenecas. We haven't necessarily got the higher paid R&amp;D jobs. It's the result of having overseas owners in the sector.\" UK companies surveyed in KPMG's global manufacturing report said a lack of R&amp;D funding was the main issue limiting innovation. Development work was heavily focused on improving existing products and services, with 71% of UK companies spending in this area. In contrast just 29% were focused on breakthrough innovation. Leech said there were no UK companies listed in the top 100 innovators in 2013 named by Thomson Reuters. There were 45 US companies, 28 Japanese companies and 12 from France. \"I think the UK government gets this and has been supporting large UK manufacturers in their R&amp;D efforts, even those who are overseas-owned,\" he said. The latest official figures showed UK spending on R&amp;D was \u00a327bn in 2012. At 1.7% of GDP, Britain's R&amp;D spending is less than the European average and falls far behind Finland's 3.6% and Germany's 2.9%.",

John Devalle Leeds, \u2022\u2008The Co-operative's current regional member meetings provide an excellent opportunity to engage with its ordinary members in driving long-overdue change in its democracy and efficiency, which many ordinary members would support. Unfortunately, the timing of the welcomed Myners report was such that it has denied members in several regions the opportunity to debate his final recommendations and provide clear guidance to representatives attending the forthcoming AGM. It would be most welcome if main board directors could make a commitment to urgently facilitate a thorough, inclusive and open discussion about the way ahead so that any polarised positions may be mediated, with our trust placed in the wisdom of deliberative participation, including ordinary members.

Steve Rouse Gee Cross, Cheshire \u2022 Your report (Co-op farms could be sold to China as hopes of community buyouts die, 5 May) includes reference to a letter from Savills, the estate agents of the Co-op Group, saying it has been instructed not to give particulars to any potential buyer without a \"proven track record in acquisitions\" and that there will be no consideration of community buyouts. I attended the annual meeting of the North region of Co-op Group members on 3 May in Leeds when concerns were raised about the sale of Co-op farms and it was clear the three north region directors of the Co-op Group were unaware of these terms for the sale of the farms. It appears that the failure to consult and inform Co-op members now even applies to members of the board of directors. And this fits the refusal to allow the Co-operative News into co-op stores and the decision to ban the Co-op News from attending the 2013 annual meeting of the Co-op Group in Manchester last May, which must not be repeated. If directors are now being kept in the dark about the sale of Co-op farms, it has to be asked who is calling the tune at the Co-op Group.

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 closed at its highest level since the turn of the millennium on Tuesday and was within 60 points of its historical record, reached in December 1999, as traders were buoyed by positive company results and the prospect of cheaper money from a mooted interest rate cut by the European Central Bank next month. The close of 6,873 was the highest for 14 years and second only to the 6,930 on the last trading day of the 20th century, before the onset of the dotcom crash. Global markets have been boosted in recent months by the cheap money supplied by central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve, but the UK index has lagged behind because of the dominance of mining shares, which have been unsettled by signs of a slowdown in China's economy. Investors now believe China's government could act to stimulate the country's economy following weak recent data, including lower than expected industrial production and retail sales figures, helping support the commodities sector. But the recent rally has been largely driven by ECB president Mario Draghi's comments last week that the central bank was ready to act next month to combat very low and falling inflation, including cutting interest rates or even beginning a bond buying programme. On top of that, US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has been at pains to ease fears that interest rates in America would rise in the near future. Despite poor US retail sales figures yesterday, analysts believe growth in the US economy will continue in the second quarter after the disruption from winter snowstorms, adding to the positive sentiment.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of AstraZeneca raised the stakes over the controversial takeover threat by US rival drugmaker Pfizer by warning on Tuesday that an aggressive cost-cutting plan by the American firm could cost the lives of cancer patients. Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca's chief executive, told MPs that the development of life-saving cancer drugs could be significantly delayed by the combined companies \"saving tax and saving costs\". Soriot, who is desperately fighting Pfizer's plans to gobble up his company in the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British firm, said the planned \u00a363bn deal could severely jeopardise the development of some of the world's most promising drugs. \"Any distractions on work we are doing now could run the risk of delaying our drugs pipeline,\" he said. \"From the lab to the patient takes many years.\" In an emotive appearance at the business select committee, Soriot said: \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed \u2013 and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs? \"It is logical to assume that a merger like this could mean substantial cost savings, and cost savings could mean job losses.\" Soriot is concerned that Pfizer's proposed takeover \u2013 which the US company admitted on Tuesday would result in job cuts and a big reduction in research and development spending \u2013 could distract AstraZeneca's scientists as they approach a crucial point in the development of several potentially life-saving drugs. Within the past week, AstraZeneca has released a string of positive test results and pushed three drugs through to late stage trials, including a lung cancer medicine fast-tracked to final stage trials. AstraZeneca began phase III large-scale hospital trials of the cancer immunotherapy drug codenamed MEDI4736 last weekearlier successful trials at American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago later this month. The drug, which uses the body's own defences to spot and kill cancer cells rather than attacking them with chemotherapy, is regarded as potentially one of the most groundbreaking of recent years. It could also be a big money-spinner, with AstraZeneca believes sales could peak at \u00a33.9bn a year. Pfizer declined to comment on the suggestion that its proposed takeover could cost lives, but its chief executive, Ian Read, told MPs that his motivation for buying AstraZeneca was to speed up the introduction of new medicines, not slow it down. \"We have an expression at Pfizer, 'Patients are waiting', and the faster we can get medicine to patients the more productive we can be and the more successful the industry will be,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>The boss of AstraZeneca raised the stakes over the controversial takeover threat by US rival drugmaker Pfizer by warning on Tuesday that an aggressive cost-cutting plan by the American firm could cost the lives of cancer&#xa0;patients.</p> <p>Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca's chief executive, told MPs that the development of life-saving cancer drugs could be significantly delayed by the combined companies \"saving tax and saving costs\".</p> <p>Soriot, who is desperately fighting Pfizer's plans to gobble up his company in the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British firm, said the planned \u00a363bn deal could severely jeopardise the development of some of the world's most promising drugs.</p> <p>\"Any distractions on work we are doing now could run the risk of delaying our drugs pipeline,\" he said. \"From the lab to the patient takes many years.\"</p> <p>In an emotive appearance at the business select committee, Soriot said: \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed \u2013 and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?</p> <p>\"It is logical to assume that a merger like this could mean substantial cost savings, and cost savings could mean job losses.\"</p> <p>Soriot is concerned that Pfizer's proposed takeover \u2013 which the US company admitted on Tuesday would result in job cuts and a big reduction in research and development spending \u2013 could distract AstraZeneca's scientists as they approach a crucial point in the development of several potentially life-saving drugs.</p> <p>Within the past week, AstraZeneca has released a string of positive test results and pushed three drugs through to late stage trials, including a lung cancer medicine fast-tracked to final stage trials.</p> <p>AstraZeneca began phase III large-scale hospital trials of the cancer immunotherapy drug codenamed MEDI4736 last weekearlier successful trials at American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago later this month.</p> <p>The drug, which uses the body's own defences to spot and kill cancer cells rather than attacking them with chemotherapy, is regarded as potentially one of the most groundbreaking of recent years. It could also be a big money-spinner, with AstraZeneca believes sales could peak at \u00a33.9bn a year.</p> <p>Pfizer declined to comment on the suggestion that its proposed takeover could cost lives, but its chief executive, Ian Read, told MPs that his motivation for buying AstraZeneca was to speed up the introduction of new medicines, not slow it down.</p> <p>\"We have an expression at Pfizer, 'Patients are waiting', and the faster we can get medicine to patients the more productive we can be and the more successful the industry will be,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "World cup years are unhappy times for financial markets. So says Dario Perkins, of Lombard Street Research, who warns it is not just football fans who should be biting their nails when the biggest event in the global football calendar kicks off next month. As Perkins describes it, the inaugural World Cup in 1930 (winners Uruguay) coincided with the start of the Great Depression. In 1990 (West Germany), the US was in recession. The bond markets were in turmoil four years later (Brazil) and 1998 (France) was the year Russia devalued the rouble and defaulted on its debt, plus the collapse of the world's biggest hedge fund, Long Term Capital Management. The correlation is not quite perfect. The dotcom recession was over by the time the World Cup was held in Japan in 2002 (Brazil) and the stock market crash was still a year away when the tournament was hosted by Mexico in 1986 (Argentina). Even so, the parallels are close enough to ponder what could go wrong in 2014. The short answer is a currency war between the US and the European Central Bank. At the moment, this is not seen as remotely possible. Stock markets are riding high; bond yields are low; the lack of volatility suggests that there are deemed to be few risks lurking out there. But it is when market players are blissfully unconcerned about the future that things can go wrong. Central banks around the world are mightily hacked off with the way the Federal Reserve has been conducting US monetary policy without giving two hoots for how it might affect anybody else. Put simply, Washington has been running a cheap dollar policy, which has meant overvalued currencies for America's trading partners. This has made life uncomfortable for the Australians, the New Zealanders and the South Koreans but has had no broader implications all the time the ECB has been forced to sit on the sidelines because of the Bundesbank's opposition to quantitative easing as a way of driving down the euro. By all accounts, Frankfurt is now up for QE, which means the ECB's president Mario Draghi can act next month against the threat of deflation. Those with long memories will recall that the 1987 stock market crash was precipitated by an exchange rate row between the US and Germany. So could things be kicking off again when the 2014 World Cup is decided in early July? Don't bet against it.",

The dotcom recession was over by the time the World Cup was held in Japan in 2002 (Brazil) and the stock market crash was still a year away when the tournament was hosted by Mexico in 1986 (Argentina). Even so, the parallels are close enough to ponder what could go wrong in 2014. The short answer is a currency war between the US and the European Central Bank.</p> <p>At the moment, this is not seen as remotely possible. Stock markets are riding high; bond yields are low; the lack of volatility suggests that there are deemed to be few risks lurking out there. But it is when market players are blissfully unconcerned about the future that things can go wrong.</p> <p>Central banks around the world are mightily hacked off with the way the Federal Reserve has been conducting US monetary policy without giving two hoots for how it might affect anybody else. Put simply, Washington has been running a cheap dollar policy, which has meant overvalued currencies for America's trading partners.</p> <p>This has made life uncomfortable for the Australians, the New Zealanders and the South Koreans but has had no broader implications all the time the ECB has been forced to sit on the sidelines because of the Bundesbank's opposition to quantitative easing as a way of driving down the euro.</p> <p>By all accounts, Frankfurt is now up for QE, which means the ECB's president Mario Draghi can act next month against the threat of deflation. Those with long memories will recall that the 1987 stock market crash was precipitated by an exchange rate row between the US and Germany.</p> <p>So could things be kicking off again when the 2014 World Cup is decided in early July? Don't bet against it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "HSBC is in last-minute talks with shareholders to reach a deal over its chairman's pay and head off a damaging revolt at next week's annual general meeting. The bank is poised to stage a partial climbdown over plans to pay Douglas Flint a bonus in shares of up to \u00a32.25m. HSBC has said his extra workload on regulatory reform justifies putting him in line for the payout this year. When Flint, a former finance director, was made chairman in 2010, HSBC said he would be paid his salary but no bonuses. In this year's annual report, HSBC said he was eligible for the group performance share plan in exceptional circumstances. The bank's remuneration committee decided the level of attention on financial regulation and bank employees' conduct was exceptional and that Flint's extra work should be rewarded. The committee proposed paying him a maximum share bonus equivalent to his \u00a31.5m salary and \u00a3750,000 pension payment \"given his executive role in leading the group's interactions on regulatory policy and providing leadership and tone to drive an improvement in the group's compliance, conduct and behaviour\". Big shareholders are unhappy about the award because building relationships with watchdogs and governments, leading on regulatory reform and upholding HSBC's reputation and character are already in Flint's job description, which is unchanged from the year before. Talks are still going on between the bank and these shareholders before the 23 May meeting in London. In an attempt to head off a revolt, HSBC is likely to pledge that any payment under the share plan will be for this year only. HSBC declined to comment on its talks with shareholders over Flint's pay, but an investor in the bank said: \"The word is it's going to be a one-off.\" Limiting Flint's maximum award to less than 100% and giving clearer guidance on how he will qualify for the bonus are also said to be under discussion. Flint earned \u00a32.43m last year but his pay would almost double if he got the maximum award proposed. If he was paid the bonus under the performance share plan, he would not get the shares for five years and be required to hold on to them until he retires. Flint's pay terms are contained in HSBC's pay policy, set out under new requirements from the business secretary, Vince Cable. The policy is subject to a binding vote at the AGM whereas the vote on the remuneration report for last year remains advisory only. Pirc, the corporate governance consultant, has urged shareholders to vote against the pay policy because HSBC introduced new fixed pay allowances to bypass a EU cap on annual bonuses. Pirc did not refer to Flint's pay. Company pPay is under extra scrutiny at this year's round of company meetings, which are the first since Cable forced boards to set out their policies for shareholder approval. Standard Chartered, HSBC's rival emerging markets bank, last week suffered the biggest revolt on a pay policy so far when 41% of shareholder votes opposed its proposed bonus terms for top executives. Flint's potential bonus is a smaller part of the overall pay policy than the executive bonuses at Standard Chartered, which investors thought were too short term. Investors said HSBC was unlikely to suffer as big a rebellion but that the plan for Flint's pay could harden the opinions of shareholders already dissatisfied with the bank's performance. At last year's AGM, 11% of shareholder votes went against HSBC's remuneration report. HSBC has awarded its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, \u00a31.7m in \"fixed pay allowances\" to get around the EU's rule capping bank bonuses at one times salary or double salary with shareholder approval. Flint does not qualify for the allowances. Governance advisers Manifest said pay at HSBC was above expectations given the bank's size and performance. HSBC said last week that trading profit for the first three months of the year fell 13% and warned that business would remain difficult in the second quarter.",

      "body": "<p>US drug firm Pfizer has admitted that its proposed \u00a363bn takeover of UK rival AstraZeneca would lead to job cuts and a big reduction in the combined companies' research and development spending.</p> <p>Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, who was subjected to a sustained questioning by MPs on Tuesday, admitted that despite his repeated assurances that the takeover would be \"win-win\" for the UK \"there will be some job cuts\".</p> <p>\"I'm not sitting here saying that we can become more efficient without some reduction in jobs,\" he told MPs on the business select committee. \"We'll be more efficient by some reduction in jobs. What I can't tell you is how much or how many or where.\"</p> <p>Read repeatedly refused to promise to protect the jobs of the combined companies' current British scientists despite publicly promising the deal was \"a win-win for society, a win-win for shareholders, and a win-win for stakeholders\".</p> <p>AstraZeneca has repeatedly rejected Pfizer's offers as significantly undervaluing the company and the UK firm's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, who also appeared before MPs on Tuesday, warned the proposed deal risked disrupting or delaying the development of life-saving drugs.</p> <p>\"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed \u2013 and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?\" Soriot told the select committee.</p> <p>Under hostile questioning at the earlier session, Read only commit to basing one-fifth of the company's global R&amp;D staff in the UK, and only for the next five years.</p> <p>\"Our commitment is to base 20% of our global research and development in the UK,\" he said. \"That is a firmer commitment and a better deal than anything else on offer.\"</p> <p>But he told MPs that overall R&amp;D spending after a takeover would decrease and he could not make any promises on the number of R&amp;D jobs the company would maintain.</p> <p>\"Globally we would probably reduce the combined budget,\" he said. \"I haven't said in which countries and where we would reduce that.</p> <p>\"I can't tell you today how many people we are going to have in R&amp;D. Once we get in we will know how many people we will need.</p> <p>\"I think the commitment of 20% of a global company's R&amp;D in the UK is an unprecedented commitment.</p> <p>\"Once the deal is completed, we will look at the global spend and decide where is the best place for science, and the UK has a great science infrastructure.\"</p> <p>Despite the expected cut backs, Read said the proposed deal \u2013 which would be the biggest by an foreign takeover of a British company \u2013 would \"strengthen the size of the UK science community\".</p> <p>The chairman of the business committee, Labour MP Adrian Bailey, asked why Britons should trust Pfizer to maintain jobs and research spending given its \"track record of basically slashing your workforce\".</p> <p>\"You've slashed the workforce by over 60,000 and nearly halved the amount spent on R&amp;D,\" he said referring to other recent Pfizer takeovers.</p> <p>Bailey put it to Read that Pfizer had been described as a \"praying mantis\" and a \"shark that needs feeding\", adding: \"What can you say to this committee to convince us that this is a leopard that has changed its spots?\"</p> <p>William Bain, another member of the committee, asked Read why should the committee believe Pfizer's pledge to maintain research in the UK.</p> <p>Read, who has worked at the US drugmaker for 35 years, said he was a \"man of my word and Pfizer is a company of its word\". He gave MPs a personal promise to maintain 20% of R&amp;D jobs in the UK for five years alongside the commitment that would be legally binding under the takeover code.</p> <p>But he refused to make a longer term pledge despite warnings from leading scientists that development of new drugs can take decades.</p> <p>Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society, said Pfizer must make a 10-year commitment to the UK, while unions representing AstraZeneca's 6,700 UK staff said the five-year pledge was \"paper thin\" and \"remarkably short-term\".</p> <p>Allan Black, national officer of the GMB union, said: \"AstraZeneca's time frame is 25 years. Generally speaking you have to allow for up to 25 years research and development to bring drugs to the marketplace. Frankly a commitment of 10 years is very, very thin indeed.\"</p> <p>Read said Britain should welcome the opportunity to have the world's largest pharmaceutical company domiciled in the UK for tax purposes and said it would be very beneficial to the Exchequer.</p> <p>Pfizer admitted that moving to the UK would also give it \"substantial tax benefits\" at the expense of US taxpayers. The company will save millions by spending its \u00a340bn cash pile it has built up overseas on buying AstraZeneca rather than bringing the money back to America, where it would be taxed.</p> <p>The tax plans have been attacked by prominent US senators Carl Levin and Roy Wyden, who are working to urgently to close the loophole.</p> <p>Pfizer said the UK's 20% corporate tax rate from next year compared with 40% in the US was \"very attractive\".</p> <p>Read praised the UK government's \"very clever\" tax breaks strategy and said it was crucial to Pfizer's decision to make an offer for AstraZeneca. \"We would change the price we are offering if we didn't have the advantage of the tax,\" he said.</p> <p>He highlighted the UK's \"patent box\" tax - introduced by George Osborne - which allows companies to pay just 10% tax on profits derived from UK research.</p> <p>Soriot warned that Pfizer's proposed tax inversion could generate substantial controversy and \"potentially impact the reputation of our company\".

      "bodyText": "US drug firm Pfizer has admitted that its proposed \u00a363bn takeover of UK rival AstraZeneca would lead to job cuts and a big reduction in the combined companies' research and development spending. Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, who was subjected to a sustained questioning by MPs on Tuesday, admitted that despite his repeated assurances that the takeover would be \"win-win\" for the UK \"there will be some job cuts\". \"I'm not sitting here saying that we can become more efficient without some reduction in jobs,\" he told MPs on the business select committee. \"We'll be more efficient by some reduction in jobs. What I can't tell you is how much or how many or where.\" Read repeatedly refused to promise to protect the jobs of the combined companies' current British scientists despite publicly promising the deal was \"a win-win for society, a win-win for shareholders, and a win-win for stakeholders\". AstraZeneca has repeatedly rejected Pfizer's offers as significantly undervaluing the company and the UK firm's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, who also appeared before MPs on Tuesday, warned the proposed deal risked disrupting or delaying the development of life-saving drugs. \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed \u2013 and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?\" Soriot told the select committee. Under hostile questioning at the earlier session, Read only commit to basing one-fifth of the company's global R&amp;D staff in the UK, and only for the next five years. \"Our commitment is to base 20% of our global research and development in the UK,\" he said. \"That is a firmer commitment and a better deal than anything else on offer.\" But he told MPs that overall R&amp;D spending after a takeover would decrease and he could not make any promises on the number of R&amp;D jobs the company would maintain. \"Globally we would probably reduce the combined budget,\" he said. \"I haven't said in which countries and where we would reduce that. \"I can't tell you today how many people we are going to have in R&amp;D. Once we get in we will know how many people we will need. \"I think the commitment of 20% of a global company's R&amp;D in the UK is an unprecedented commitment. \"Once the deal is completed, we will look at the global spend and decide where is the best place for science, and the UK has a great science infrastructure.\" Despite the expected cut backs, Read said the proposed deal \u2013 which would be the biggest by an foreign takeover of a British company \u2013 would \"strengthen the size of the UK science community\". The chairman of the business committee, Labour MP Adrian Bailey, asked why Britons should trust Pfizer to maintain jobs and research spending given its \"track record of basically slashing your workforce\". \"You've slashed the workforce by over 60,000 and nearly halved the amount spent on R&amp;D,\" he said referring to other recent Pfizer takeovers. Bailey put it to Read that Pfizer had been described as a \"praying mantis\" and a \"shark that needs feeding\", adding: \"What can you say to this committee to convince us that this is a leopard that has changed its spots?\" William Bain, another member of the committee, asked Read why should the committee believe Pfizer's pledge to maintain research in the UK. Read, who has worked at the US drugmaker for 35 years, said he was a \"man of my word and Pfizer is a company of its word\". He gave MPs a personal promise to maintain 20% of R&amp;D jobs in the UK for five years alongside the commitment that would be legally binding under the takeover code. But he refused to make a longer term pledge despite warnings from leading scientists that development of new drugs can take decades. Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society, said Pfizer must make a 10-year commitment to the UK, while unions representing AstraZeneca's 6,700 UK staff said the five-year pledge was \"paper thin\" and \"remarkably short-term\". Allan Black, national officer of the GMB union, said: \"AstraZeneca's time frame is 25 years. Generally speaking you have to allow for up to 25 years research and development to bring drugs to the marketplace. Frankly a commitment of 10 years is very, very thin indeed.\" Read said Britain should welcome the opportunity to have the world's largest pharmaceutical company domiciled in the UK for tax purposes and said it would be very beneficial to the Exchequer. Pfizer admitted that moving to the UK would also give it \"substantial tax benefits\" at the expense of US taxpayers. The company will save millions by spending its \u00a340bn cash pile it has built up overseas on buying AstraZeneca rather than bringing the money back to America, where it would be taxed. The tax plans have been attacked by prominent US senators Carl Levin and Roy Wyden, who are working to urgently to close the loophole. Pfizer said the UK's 20% corporate tax rate from next year compared with 40% in the US was \"very attractive\". Read praised the UK government's \"very clever\" tax breaks strategy and said it was crucial to Pfizer's decision to make an offer for AstraZeneca. \"We would change the price we are offering if we didn't have the advantage of the tax,\" he said. He highlighted the UK's \"patent box\" tax - introduced by George Osborne - which allows companies to pay just 10% tax on profits derived from UK research. Soriot warned that Pfizer's proposed tax inversion could generate substantial controversy and \"potentially impact the reputation of our company\". But it emerged later in the hearing that AstraZeneca paid no corporate taxes last year because its operations in the UK made a loss. On Monday Pfizer sidestepped AstraZeneca's board and made a direct appeal to shareholders that it should be allowed to buy the British firm. In a statement to the City, Pfizer said it \"remains disappointed at the lack of engagement by the AstraZeneca board\" and warned that the UK firm would face \"challenges\" if it remained independent. AstraZeneca dismissed Pfizer as \"opportunistic\", with Soriot telling MPs the UK firm was better off alone. \"We have the scale, we have the people, we have the talent, we have the products, we are confident we can succeed,\" he said. But after the hearing Soriot indicated that AstraZeneca's board would be open to a bid if Pfizer substantially increased its offer. Rumours in the City suggest that Pfizer is planning to slightly increase its bid above the current \u00a350-a-share offer before it considers taking the takeover hostile by making its offer direct to shareholders. A fresh bid is unlikely to take place until after the executives face further questioning by MPs on the science select committee on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's big four banks were forced to set aside \u00a321.5bn to cover fines and customer redress in 2013, according to research published on Wednesday. The amount, calculated by the London School of Economics, comes on top of nearly \u00a325bn of conduct costs incurred by the four \u2013 Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 since the banking crisis in 2008. The sums illustrate the scale of the problem the industry faces in trying to clean up its reputation. Roger McCormick, the LSE professor who compiled the data, said the totals would have to fall before banks could demonstrate that their relationship with regulators and customers was improving. \"What do these costs tell us? Could analysis of these costs be used by banks as part of their restoring trust agenda? Whatever they may say now about these being legacy issues, they can't keep saying that. These numbers need to be coming down over time,\" he said. About \u00a319bn of the \u00a325bn was incurred in 2012, when, McCormick said, \"payment protection insurance provision came home to roost\". He said that accounted for the bulk of the increase in 2013. McCormick is working with New City Agenda (NCA), a new thinktank co-chaired by the Labour peer Lord McFall, to look at ways of using the data to measure improvements in the culture of banks. The idea was raised by Sir Richard Lambert \u2013 a former head of the employers' body the CBI and a former editor of the Financial Times \u2013 as part of his consultation on creating a body to restore the industry's reputation. Lambert, who is to speak at a reception for MPs this Wednesday was asked in September by the chief executives of the UK's large banks to come up with proposals for a body that could improve banking's reputation in the wake of scandals such as Libor rigging and payment protection insurance mis-selling. \"The banks' conduct costs are harming their balance sheets, it's not good for \u2026 the wider economy. The money that is being spent on fines could be lent to business or [could] rebuild their capital so that they can serve their customers better,\" said McFall. McFall, who was part of the parliamentary commission on banking standards set up following the furore caused by Barclays' \u00a3290m fine for Libor rigging, said the NCA \u2013 which has the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, on its advisory board \u2013 and the LSE wanted to work together to help devise benchmarks for the industry. Lambert, who is expected to update the City on his consultation next week, has published a consultation paper with 19 questions for the industry to address, including one covering the need to \"help to develop a common set of benchmarks against which individual banks can assess their performance against others in their peer group\". McCormick is also hosting a conference at the LSE on Wednesday to discuss ways of creating benchmarks. His conduct costs project at the LSE previously published data showing that 10 big banks, including Bank of America and UBS, and the four UK banks, ran up a bill of almost \u00a3150bn in the five years after the 2008 crisis.",

The key issue is that they would have to be meaningful and binding.\" </p> <p>The letter was \"a basis for negotiation\", and not an offer that the Government has accepted, he told MPs. </p> <p>He made clear that he was \"keeping the option open\" of intervention on the grounds of a public interest in the protection of Britain's research base. </p> <p>Asked whether ministers across Government were ready to intervene, Mr Cable said: \"Yes, we work as a team and my colleagues have made very clear that, like me, they want options kept open. </p> <p>\"We recognise that we have to keep the options open both in terms of securing assurances and potentially of intervention.\" </p> <p>Pressed on whether this could involve legislation after Parliament returns for the Queen's Speech on June 4, he said: \"We do understand across Government that there has to be that option. When we are talking to the companies about assurances, they have to understand that we would, as a Government, in certain circumstances consider intervention.\" </p> <p>Committee member William Bain said that the Pfizer executives had been unable to give any assurances on numbers of jobs or investment in the UK if the takeover went ahead. </p> <p>\"The problem is that the assurances that we were given this morning as a committee lacked credibility and they lacked substance,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Cable suggested that any breach of commitments made during the course of the takeover bid could eventually be the subject of legal action by the Takeover Panel. But he said that this option has not yet been tested in the courts and it was unclear what penalties would be available. </p> <p>It was also possible that the European Commission and the UK's Competitions and Markets Authority could intervene. </p> <p>But he declined to say whether the Government has been in contact with the Commission over the bid, warning that in itself this would have a \"potentially highly significant\" impact on the bid. </p> <p>Mr Bain asked the Business Secretary whether he was comfortable with the fact that Pfizer's offer appeared to be \"geared to reducing its tax liabilities, which is potentially going to be paid for by massive reductions in jobs in this country and perhaps in the US\". </p> <p>Mr Cable replied: \"Of course not. That is why we are looking at this extremely seriously and engaging with both companies to make sure the immense value of our research base is not only protected but strengthened.\" </p> <p>Pfizer had made it clear that its decisions were in part driven by the principle of inversion in the US tax system, under which a company which holds significant amounts of cash outside the US can reduce tax liabilities on income streams arising from acquisitions abroad, he said. </p> <p>\"This is an anomaly which they have made clear they wish to take advantage of,\" said Mr Cable. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53722818e4b00d5b6b59409b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-13T14:42:00.335Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>AstraZeneca chief Pascal Soriot's warning that cancer patients could die because new drugs are delayed by merger disruption has caught Reuters' attention.</b></p> <p>They also write that Pfizer suggested it could hike its offer if AstraZeneca would only give it a fair hearing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>U.S. drugmaker Pfizer hinted it could raise its proposed $106 billion offer if AstraZeneca would only engage in talks, as its boss was grilled by UK lawmakers on his commitment to British research spending and jobs.</p> <p>In response AstraZeneca said it would have to consider a compelling offer but accused Pfizer of an \"opportunistic\" proposal and a ploy to cut taxes that risked its reputation.</p> <p>Pascal Soriot, the French-born boss of AstraZeneca, came out fighting after Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read made clear the New York-based group would not rule out a hostile bid if Britain's second-biggest drugmaker did not enter merger talks.</p> <p>Having warned that AstraZeneca could wither without its financial muscle, Pfizer expressed its frustration at being rebuffed, and said on Tuesday that working with the UK company's board could help deliver \"optimal deal terms\" which AstraZeneca could recommend to its shareholders.</p> <p>Soriot - who appeared after Read to answer questions from a parliamentary select committee - said Pfizer's proposal risked disrupting its research and delaying getting life-saving new drugs to market, as well as undervaluing the business.</p> <p>\"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed - and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?\" he asked.</p> <p>Pfizer's plan to cut its tax bill by re-domiciling to Britain if it buys AstraZeneca also posed a reputational risk, Soriot added.</p> <p>\"The proposed tax inversion structure, we are afraid, could generate substantial controversy and potentially delay this merger and potentially impact the reputation of our company.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/05/13/astrazeneca-pfizer-idINL6N0NZ1XB20140513\">UK lawmakers give Pfizer stick as it waves carrot at AstraZeneca</a></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-05-13T14:50:52.618Z\">at 3.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53722e4ee4b0907f0d37d7fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-13T14:38:11.869Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ITVJoel/statuses/466214018999275521\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Sir David Barnes (former boss of AstraZeneca) bumped into Pascal Soriot for 1st time in our studio.

      "bodyText": "One last thing - here's Chuka Umunna MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, commenting after the BIS Select Committee hearing on AstraZeneca and Pfizer. \u201cThe Tory-led government\u2019s claims about this deal being \u2018a great Anglo-American tie up\u2019 are looking more and more ridiculous by the day. It is clear that any assurances on jobs, investment and Britain\u2019s science base are not worth the paper they are written on given the caveats attached to the commitments given. \u201cThis hearing reinforced Labour\u2019s grave concerns about this potential takeover and confirmed the worst fears of the British business and science community about its impact. Pfizer confirmed the transaction will lead to cuts in R&amp;D spend of the proposed combined entity, that there will job losses and that they plan to split up AstraZeneca and potentially sell off parts of the business. \u201cThe case for an independent assessment of the impact of this deal and a stronger public interest test, which Labour has called for, is now overwhelming.\u201d And that's all for the day. Here's an updated summary: Vince Cable told the BIS committee that the government was keeping its options open on the prospect of Pfizer taking over AstraZeneca. The business secretary said he wants to see \"more meaningful and binding\" commitments from Pfizer, in what could be the biggest takeover ever of a UK firm by a foreign rival. Ian Read's word alone is not enough, he said. Cable insisted the government was being even-handed with both companies. But he refused to say whether he'd been talking to the EU competition authorities. He cautioned that any government intervention in the public interest could have legal implications. Earlier this morning.... AstraZeneca warned that a merger with Pfizer could cause devastating damage to its drugs pipeline, and deprive patients of life-saving drugs. Appearing before the BIS committee, CEO Pascal Soriot warned that Astra's precious drugs pipeline could be disrupted by a deal. What do we tell someone whose father dies from lung cancer because a drug was delayed, because the company was focused on cutting costs, he asks the committee. The disruption from a deal could \"absolutely\" delay life-saying drugs, he added. His colleage Mene Pangalos, agreed that a merger could have devastating consequences, while Dr Jane Osbourn warned that Pfizer's five-year pledges didn't recognise the true timescale of drug development. Soriot also said he fears reputational damage to his company from Pfizer's plan to 'invert' its tax base, to take advantage of the lower corporation tax in Britain. Astra also pledged to maintain R&amp;D spending and staffing levels at current levels, or higher, in the UK, saying its Cambridge site can compete with the best in the world. But Soriot did also take flak from the committee over AstraZeneca's tax affairs, after he confirmed that the company hasn't paid corporation tax here last year (due to losses and R&amp;D spend). And he said that Astra was not closed to any deal with Pfizer, if the terms were right. Pfizer has insisted that the takeover would be good for Britain, but refused to make any firm commitments on job cuts. Pfizer boss CEO Ian Read flew in from America, to tell MPs that the deal was a compelling idea that would create a world-class pharmaceuticals powerhouse in the UK, and help deliver new drugs faster. In a sometimes heated session, Read insisted that Pfizer could be trusted to stick to the pledges it has made to the UK government. I give you my word that we will meet these pledges, said Read But Read also conceded that the merger would lead to job cuts, but wouldn't say where. MPs appeared unimpressed, and unconvinced, by Pfizer's case -- as Read refused to commit to what a pledge of keeping \"substantial\" staffing levels in Macclesfield would mean in practice. Several questions went unanswered - Pfizer wouldn't say how much tax it expects to save through a deal. And Read and colleagues were vague about what its promise to keep 20% of global R&amp;D jobs in the UK would mean in practice. The unions said staff are worried Representatives from Unite and GMB said staff fear job cuts and serious damage to the UK science base. Pfizer's track record means it can't be trusted, they said. Thanks for reading and for all the comments, and your help through the day. GW Here's our full news story on today's hearing at parliament: Pfizer boss refuses to rule out UK job cuts amid questioning by MPs The boss of US drug firm Pfizer has admitted that its proposed \u00a363bn takeover of UK rival AstraZeneca will lead to job cuts and a big reduction in the combined companies' research and development spending. During questioning from MPs Ian Read said: \"There will be jobs cuts somewhere, that's part of being more efficient.\" Despite making repeated promises about the security of British scientists' jobs following the takeover, Read refused to rule out cuts to the workforce. Read would only commit to basing 20% of the company's global R&amp;D staff in the UK, and only for the next five years. The Scottish-born executive repeatedly refused to promise not to cut the overall number of UK jobs following the proposed takeover. \"Our commitment is to base 20% of our global research and development in the UK,\" he said. \"That is a firmer commitment and a better deal than anything else on offer.\" But he told MPs on the business select committee that he could not make any promises on the number of R&amp;D jobs the company would maintain following a takeover. \"I can't tell you today how many people we are going to have in R&amp;D,\" he said. \"Once we get in we will know how many people we will need. We will staff the R&amp;D post the transaction to the level that we need. \"I really can't give you final numbers \u2026 I think the commitment of 20% of a global company's R&amp;D in the UK is an unprecedented commitment. \"Once the deal is completed, we will look at the global spend and decide where is the best place for science, and the UK has a great science infrastructure.\" More here. The Unite union insists that Pfizer knows what job cuts it has in mind if it succeeds in a takeover bid, says ITV's Jess Brammar. Vince Cable's session before the committee was fairly subdued - with the business secretary determined to avoid saying anything that might break the Takeover Code. His key message, I think, was that the government is keeping its options open - and he wants to see tougher guarantees from Pfizer than at present. PA has rounded up the key points from Vince Cable's appearance: Mr Cable told the committee that the assurances made by Pfizer in an open letter to the Government about its commitments to the UK over the next five years covered the \"broad areas\" of ministers' concerns about research, employment and manufacturing. But he added: \"We would, if these conversations continue, want to make them more specific. The key issue is that they would have to be meaningful and binding.\" The letter was \"a basis for negotiation\", and not an offer that the Government has accepted, he told MPs. He made clear that he was \"keeping the option open\" of intervention on the grounds of a public interest in the protection of Britain's research base. Asked whether ministers across Government were ready to intervene, Mr Cable said: \"Yes, we work as a team and my colleagues have made very clear that, like me, they want options kept open. \"We recognise that we have to keep the options open both in terms of securing assurances and potentially of intervention.\" Pressed on whether this could involve legislation after Parliament returns for the Queen's Speech on June 4, he said: \"We do understand across Government that there has to be that option. When we are talking to the companies about assurances, they have to understand that we would, as a Government, in certain circumstances consider intervention.\" Committee member William Bain said that the Pfizer executives had been unable to give any assurances on numbers of jobs or investment in the UK if the takeover went ahead. \"The problem is that the assurances that we were given this morning as a committee lacked credibility and they lacked substance,\" he said. Mr Cable suggested that any breach of commitments made during the course of the takeover bid could eventually be the subject of legal action by the Takeover Panel. But he said that this option has not yet been tested in the courts and it was unclear what penalties would be available. It was also possible that the European Commission and the UK's Competitions and Markets Authority could intervene. But he declined to say whether the Government has been in contact with the Commission over the bid, warning that in itself this would have a \"potentially highly significant\" impact on the bid. Mr Bain asked the Business Secretary whether he was comfortable with the fact that Pfizer's offer appeared to be \"geared to reducing its tax liabilities, which is potentially going to be paid for by massive reductions in jobs in this country and perhaps in the US\". Mr Cable replied: \"Of course not. That is why we are looking at this extremely seriously and engaging with both companies to make sure the immense value of our research base is not only protected but strengthened.\" Pfizer had made it clear that its decisions were in part driven by the principle of inversion in the US tax system, under which a company which holds significant amounts of cash outside the US can reduce tax liabilities on income streams arising from acquisitions abroad, he said. \"This is an anomaly which they have made clear they wish to take advantage of,\" said Mr Cable. AstraZeneca chief Pascal Soriot's warning that cancer patients could die because new drugs are delayed by merger disruption has caught Reuters' attention. They also write that Pfizer suggested it could hike its offer if AstraZeneca would only give it a fair hearing: U.S. drugmaker Pfizer hinted it could raise its proposed $106 billion offer if AstraZeneca would only engage in talks, as its boss was grilled by UK lawmakers on his commitment to British research spending and jobs. In response AstraZeneca said it would have to consider a compelling offer but accused Pfizer of an \"opportunistic\" proposal and a ploy to cut taxes that risked its reputation. Pascal Soriot, the French-born boss of AstraZeneca, came out fighting after Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read made clear the New York-based group would not rule out a hostile bid if Britain's second-biggest drugmaker did not enter merger talks. Having warned that AstraZeneca could wither without its financial muscle, Pfizer expressed its frustration at being rebuffed, and said on Tuesday that working with the UK company's board could help deliver \"optimal deal terms\" which AstraZeneca could recommend to its shareholders. Soriot - who appeared after Read to answer questions from a parliamentary select committee - said Pfizer's proposal risked disrupting its research and delaying getting life-saving new drugs to market, as well as undervaluing the business. \"What will we tell the person whose father died from lung cancer because one of our medicines was delayed - and essentially was delayed because in the meantime our two companies were involved in saving tax and saving costs?\" he asked. Pfizer's plan to cut its tax bill by re-domiciling to Britain if it buys AstraZeneca also posed a reputational risk, Soriot added. \"The proposed tax inversion structure, we are afraid, could generate substantial controversy and potentially delay this merger and potentially impact the reputation of our company.\" UK lawmakers give Pfizer stick as it waves carrot at AstraZeneca Interesting.... Over on fastFT , Andrew Ward reckons that Ian Read sidestepped the 'easy traps' laid by the committee during his evidence session (highlights start back at 10am). But the Pfizer CEO's admission that some jobs will be cut if the deal goes though is capturing the headlines. Here's what Read told the committee: \"We'll be efficient by some reduction in jobs. What I cannot tell you is how much or how many or where. We'll look at this as our global combined footprint and then we'll make decisions.\" \"I do not expect the combined [R&amp;D] budget will stay the same. I expect it to be lower. How much I cannot say.\" Pfizer hearing wrap: Read sidesteps easy traps Barrister Carl Gardner, a former government lawyer (who blogs here), isn't convinced by Pfizer's promise this morning that its pledges are legally binding. He cites the precedent of Kraft, which was merely rebuked by the Takeover Panel after shutting a Somerset factory which it had vowed to keep running: While Alex Andreou, Guardian contributor, points to the depth of legal small print in Pfizer's pledges: The session ends with the committee asking Cable for his personal view on the takeover - but again, the business secretary won't give anything away. One day, when I am free of these responsibilities, I will have my say, he smiles. We'll buy the book, one MP jokes back. Which rather sums up the low-key nature of the session And that's the end. Sorry about the web streaming problems at the start (the 30 minute pause between Astra and Cable was problematic, but I think we caught the main points). Summary and reaction to follow.... The committee is trying to pin Vince Cable down on whether the government would launch a public interest test, or bring in any new legislation to protect the country's science base. But he's playing a straight bat. We do understand across government about the importance of protecting the public interest, he says. Are you talking to AstraZeneca as well as Pfizer? Yes, Cable replies, and we are determined to be even-handed over the deal. Does Vince Cable share AstraZeneca and the unions' concerns for the workforce, and the way this takeover battle is dragging on? Cable says that he don't want thousands of workers facing uncertainty - Astra is in the middle of a move (from Macclesfield to Cambridge). But the brutal truth is that there are legal frameworks, and these things take time. Brian Binley calls up Vince Cable on his comments about how Pfizer shouldn't be allowed to buy AstraZeneca for tax purposes. I never said that, Cable replies, (spurring Binley to promise to \"reprimand his researcher\" later) My point is that Pfizer's 'tax inversion' plan is a worry, he explains. Rebecca Harris MP flags up concerns that the UK now looks attractive to companies looking to cut their tax bills, rather than for other reasons. Cable says he's happy that Britain looks an attractive place to do business. Back to the issue of Pfizer's legally binding pledges. The letter to the government says these pledges will be met, subject to the company's other obligations to its \"feduciary duties\". This is a legal minefield, right? M'learned friends would fight for years. You're right, Cable says. It's not satisfactory to rely on something that's not yet been tested in the courts. That's why he wants tighter promises than those made so far (as he explained earlier in his session). What discussions has the government had with the EU competition authorities? Cable goes all coy - he won't say anything about this issue, as anything he says could have a serious impact on the deal, and shareholders. The committee raises another issue - what sanctions could the High Court take if Pfizer breaks its pledges (this issue came up in Ian Read's grilling this morning). Cable says the government must talk to the Takeover Panel about potential legal penalties, and what the significance would be. He doesn't know what the penalties could be - the issue only came up this morning, and the government needs to investigate.... Cable says the government has been talking to AstraZeneca as well as Pfizer on the commitments it will make to the UK (like a good dancer, he knows it takes two to tango). On AstraZ's tax affairs, Cable says I think this is something which HMRC could have a view on. I can't give an off-the-cuff view, he adds. What pledges is the UK government looking for, exactly? Cable says they must match the UK's industrial strategy. We are aiming to increase UK science and development in the UK. Willie Bain MP asks Cable about Pfizer's track record - which suggests saving will be paid for by major job cuts. Are you happy about that? Of course not, Cable replies. That's why were taking this extremely seriously. Are you seeking written assurances that go beyond the ones already made to the prime minister, on jobs? I've already said that the letter is a prelude to a serious discussion, a starting point, Cable replies. We would want specificity from Pfizer. MPs are asking Cable how the government would make Pfizer's legally binding, so they can't wriggle out of them? We are getting into areas that I'm reluctant to discuss, Cable says. But he explains that it is \"essential\" that any commitment is legal and binding. But Ian Read says that his word is his bond, and can be trusted. Do you want more than that? \"I think so... I know so\", Cable replies with a chuckle Cable is also online here - with many thanks to Henk van Klaveren. Good news - Vince Cable's session is now being streamed here. Cable has told MPs that the government could intervene, but there could be legal consequences if the Westminster took legal action. From the Grimond Room, my colleague Julia Kollewe has full details of Vince Cable's comments to MPs: Another issue is that Parliament rises for its summer holidays in a couple of months. The FT aren't impressed: Katy Clark MP asks Cable about the key issue - whether the government could take exercise the public interest test on a Pfizer takeover. Cable replies that such a move could be \"quite tricky\", but reassures MPs that the government is looking all possible options. 13-May-2014 13:07 - UK BUSINESS MINISTER CABLE SAYS PUBLIC INTEREST MOVE ON ASTRAZENECA AZN.L PFIZER PFE.N \"QUITE TRICKY\" 13-May-2014 13:09 - UK BUSINESS MINISTER CABLE SAYS ASTRAZENECA AZN.L, PFIZER PFE.N DISCUSSIONS \"COMPLEX AND POSSIBLY LONG PROCESS\" Rather awkwardly, the live feed from parliament hasn't reared back into life for Vince Cable, and Sky have broken away too. So our coverage could be a little truncated... #apologies Vince Cable is up at the BIS committee now. He starts by telling the committee that he is attending as a policymaker, not a commentator. So don't expect too much from the business secretary, in other words. Cable tells the committee that the takeover is primarily an issue for AstraZeneca and Pfizer themselves. We are major stakeholders, there is a serious national interest here, but that must be pursued through the usual channels, he explains. David Rutley, MP for Macclesfield, tweets that Astra has made more concrete commitments on the site in his constituency than Pfizer. Wow, that was quite a session. We've got a few minutes until Vince Cable appears, so here's a quick summary of the key points. AstraZeneca has warned that a merger with Pfizer could cause devastating damage to its drugs pipeline, and deprive patients of life-saving drugs. Appearing before the BIS committee, CEO Pascal Soriot warned that Astra's precious drugs pipeline could be disrupted by a deal. What do we tell someone whose father dies from lung cancer because a drug was delayed, because the company was focused on cutting costs, he asks the committee. The disruption from a deal could \"absolutely\" delay life-saying drugs, he added. His colleage Mene Pangalos, agreed that a merger could have devastating consequences, while Dr Jane Osbourn warned that Pfizer's five-year pledges didn't recognise the true timescale of drug development. Soriot also said he fears reputational damage to his company from Pfizer's plan to 'invert' its tax base, to take advantage of the lower corporation tax in Britain. Astra also pledged to maintain R&amp;D spending and staffing levels at current levels, or higher, in the UK, saying its Cambridge site can compete with the best in the world. But Soriot did also take flak from the committee over AstraZeneca's tax affairs, after he confirmed that the company hasn't paid corporation tax here last year (due to losses and R&amp;D spend). And he said that Astra was not closed to any deal with Pfizer, if the terms were right. Pfizer has insisted that the takeover would be good for Britain, but refused to make any firm commitments on job cuts. Pfizer boss CEO Ian Read flew in from America, to tell MPs that the deal was a compelling idea that would create a world-class pharmaceuticals powerhouse in the UK, and help deliver new drugs faster. In a sometimes heated session, Read insisted that Pfizer could be trusted to stick to the pledges it has made to the UK government. I give you my word that we will meet these pledges, said Read But Read also conceded that the merger would lead to some job cuts, but wouldn't say where. MPs appeared unimpressed, and unconvinced, by Pfizer's case -- as Read refused to commit to what a pledge of keeping \"substantial\" staffing levels in Macclesfield would mean in practice. Several questions went unanswered - Pfizer wouldn't say how much tax it expects to save through a deal. And Read and colleagues were vague about what its promise to keep 20% of global R&amp;D jobs in the UK would mean in practice. The unions said staff are worried Representatives from Unite and GMB said staff fear job cuts and serious damage to the UK science base. Pfizer's track record means it can't be trusted, they said. Adrian Bailey concludes Astra's session by asking whether Pacal Soriot thinks Entente Cordiale should trump the Special Relationship. Soriot ruins this carefully planned joke by replying that he actually feels Australian (he worked there for several years), and plans to retire there. Cue laughter. And the end of the session. Short break, then Vince Cable at 1pm. From the committee room, my colleague Julia Kollewe clarifies the point on Astra's tax status (see earlier post) OK, so is AstraZeneca saying that it will definitely keep its current research spend, and workforce, and could even increase it? Mene Pangalos, executive vice resident for Innovative Medicines and Early Development, nods his head vigorously. CEO Pascal Soriot confirms it. We'll certainly maintain the current levels, and if we do very well I hope to increase investment, he says. What firm promises will AstraZeneca make to the UK? (good - another tougher question). Soriot, like Ian Read earlier, plays the legacy card. He says the Cambridge research facility being build at present is designed to secure AstraZeneca's long-term future. We have the critical mass we need already, he adds. We don't need Pfizer. There's non-tax payers, and non-tax payers, of course... How much tax do you pay? We paid \u00a31.5bn in taxes in the UK over the last five years, plus another \u00a31bn in employee taxes, says Soriot. But we made a loss last year, so we didn't pay any corporation tax (as no profits to tax) Brian Binley wades in -- when do you think you'll pay tax in the UK again? Finally a tough question for AZ, who have been getting a more sympathetic hearing. Soriot won't say. Astra is pitching itself as the firm who will keep spending on UK research and development to get results, rather than Pfizer who will look to make cuts. Soriot says that AstraZeneca will benefit from the new Patent Box announced by George Osborne, as most of its products were developed in the UK. Pascal Soriot reiterates that he is worried that Pfizer's proposed tax changes could lead to reputational damage. Clearly he's aware that tax avoidance is a hot issue in the UK (as witnessed this week by Gary Barlow- another famous product of Cheshire , like the drugs that have poured out of Astra's Macclesfield site over the years). Soriot denies that AstraZeneca is closed to any deal. We'd have to consider one which truly valued the company and which addressed our concerns (over disruption and the tax inversion change that Pfizer says will cut its tax bill), he adds. Have you spoken to the government? Pascal Soriot says there have been some discussions, but nothing very specific (a contrast with Pfizer's talks, I'd suggest). He declines to say whether he's happy with the government's position, or would welcome a firm line on the deal from Downing Street. We want governments to provide an environment that incentivises companies to work with academia, Soriot concludes. He seems happy with the set-up today MPs ask about the statement AZ released to the City today. Soriot explains that Pfizer's offer doesn't represent its true value. It values the old AstraZeneca, not the new one. That reminds me of the Cadbury takeover in 2009 - when the City was too slow to recognised the improvements made, until Kraft swooped.... Where will the efficiency savings come, if not from job cuts? You'll have to ask them, Soriot says. I have asked them.... Soriot says he can't comment. So are you saying that this merger could delay potentially life-saving drugs? Absolutely, absolutely, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot replies. MPs appear convinced, and concerned. If I had to wager, I'd say this committee is going to come out against this merger.... The third witness, Dr Jane Osbourn (not corporate VP Ian Brimicombe as billed) tells the committee that she joined AstraZeneca in a takeover in 2006 (Pfizer isn't the only company that engages in mergers and acquisitions) The products we were working on then are only reaching successful clinical trials now, Dr Osbourn says, a five year pledge isn't really good enough. Does AstraZeneca share the concerns of Pfizer's former head of research, Dr John LaMattina, that the takeover could be devastating for research? Mene Pangalos, Astra's executive vice president for Innovative Medicines and Early Development, says that it would certainly be very hard to get through the process, and that disruption would lead to delays, disruption to drugs. So it could be devastating? \"It can be devastating, yes.\" In other news, the euro has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in a month, following reports that the Bundesbank is open to more stimulus measures from the European Central Bank. The euro fell to $1.3715 as the Wall Street Journal reported the German central bank would back measures including a negative rate on bank deposits and purchases of packaged bank loans, if it was needed to keep inflation from staying too low in the eurozone. The euro was also down as Germany's ZEW index of economic sentiment came in sharply below expectations. The index fell to 33.1 points from 43.2 points a month earlier, well below economists' forecasts for a smaller fall to 41. Soriot reiterates that any delays to drug development would hurt patients, and shareholders. Why is the new Cambridge HQ so important? It's the only place in the world that can compete with Boston and San Francisco in doing really world class pharmaceuticals, Astra replies. A true jewel in the crown, in other words. MPs ask Pascal Soriot's views on what Pfizer's pledge to keep 20% of R&amp;D workers would mean in practice. He says it's impossible to say -- it could mean a similar joint workforce, or it could mean serious cuts. At present we have 30% of workers in Britain, and we have a long-term commitment to this country Soriot insists. Why did you reject Pfizer's bids? Soriot says the offers substantially undervalued Astra. And he's worried about the \"execution risk\" on two levels. 1) the risk that any merger of this magniture distracts staff and R&amp;D work 2) The risk around Pfizer's tax inversion structure - we are afraid it could create controversy, delay merger, and hurt the reputation of the company. Soriot questions whether there are really large efficiency savings in the merger. Efficiency means getting more out for more what you spend -- but often people talk about efficiency when they really mean cost-cutting, he adds. We are already focused on efficiency. Adrian Bailey MP presses Soriot on the commercial upsides that Pfizer sees. Soriot repeats that his focus is on science, and the drawback of potential disruption. What do we tell someone whose father dies from lung cancer because a drug was delayed, because the company was focused on cutting costs, he asks the committee. What are the advantages of a merger with Pfizer? CEO Pascal Soriot says there are plenty of disadvantages. We have been successful in building a pipeline of exciting drugs, he says. I think we are successful, and deal worries me -- our people are currently very focused, and a merger of this magnitude could create a distraction that would potentially delay projects. Now it's AstraZeneca's team. We have: Pascal Soriot, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicines and Early Development, and Ian Brimicombe, Vice President, Corporate Finance, AstraZeneca plc Dr Jane Osbourn Adrian Bailey gets a late dig into Ian Read - given your age, how can we trust that you'll be at the helm in the long term? Read gives one of those humourless smiles - for a CEO, a legacy that he leaves behind is hugely important. And that's the end of the session. Bailey thanks Pfizer for coming -- unlike Kraft's CEO several years ago during the Cadbury takeover. Next up - AstraZeneca's team. Another series of questions around the legality of Pfizer's pledges. Read says the takeover panel could intervene - although it's not happened before. Katy Clark MP points out that Pfizer has made verbal commitemnts before, and so have other companies, that haven't been maintained over the long term. We can't other companies. You have a legal commitment, and my word, Read replies. A surreal moment, when Brian Binley asks about the gold coin which Ian Read carried around. One side says \"straight talk\" while on the other it says \"own it\" - did you flip that coin today, and what side came up? [Update]: this is a curious element of Pfizer's corporate culture - Read says the idea is that it empowers staff members, who can use the coin to request a direct conversation with a colleague when needed. Binley give him some straight talk back -- saying Read hasn't been straight enough with the committee today. \u201cI believe you span it this morning and got \u2018Own It,\u2019\u201d Binley said. \u201cCan we have straight talk?\u201d McKechin asks about the reports that Pfizer would split a combined company into three divisons. That's right , Read replies. That's how we run already, to get the best value for shareholders. It also makes it easier to sell a division off, McKechin suggests. Can you give a categorical assurance that none will be sold off? No I can't give that assurance, Frank D'Amelio replies. Anne McKechin MP asks what substantial changes it would take for Pfizer to ditch its commitments. Read says it would be a vey high bar - which a man on the Clapham bus would accept as a significant change. We are very ethical company, he insists. We can be trusted. If we break these pledges, you can call us back Bit late by then, of course. Willie Bain MP returns to the fray -- Pfizer MUST be able to say what it will do with its workforce after a merger. Ian Read denies it - - saying that right now, I simply doesn't know what Astra staff are working on right now. Which projects are duplicates of our projects/ When the deal is done and I get in, we'll see. (I think he means IF the deal is done) OK, asks Bain - define what your commitment to keep a \"substantial\" workforce in Macclesfield means. The word means what it says - there will be a substantial presence, Read replies. How many staff in Macclesfielf will have a job in five years? Read demures Two years? Read demures again One year! There will be a substantial presence in Macclesfield, Read insists. And he repeats that he is making an unprecedented pledge, to keep 20% of R&amp;D workers here. What plans does Pfizer have for AstraZeneca's new HQ in Cambridge (currently being built)? Ian Read says Pfizer is committed to building it, and will use it properly. OK, but after the Wyeth takeover you cut R&amp;D spending. Should we expect the same again? You can't used Wyeth as \"a cookie cutter\" for what a successful pharma merger looks like, Read replies - showing his decades of domicile in the UK rather than his Scottish roots. The committee isn't convinced. If you've decided merging the company bid makes sense, and you've looked at the books, and you've decided to keep 20% of R&amp;D staff in the UK, it can't be hard to crunch the numbers and work out what that means.... Read denies it. Who benefits both from this deal, the UK taxpayer or the Pfizer shareholder? They both benefit, insists VP Frank D'Amelio. And no, the committee can't have more details because Pfizer hasn't held talks with AstraZeneca. Which deals have Pfizer got wrong over the years? Read has a little ponder, and reckons he can't think of many. A joint venture in India was a disappointment, but on the other hand the Wyeth mega deal was a big success. I think our track record has been pretty good, he adds. Modestly put, Sir. Is it true that Pfizer paid no tax in 2012, or even got more money back through tax credits than it handed over? Pfizer says it paid \u00a3400m in UK tax over the last three years, but that included taxes on its workforce wages. (updated) But you agree that the deal will provide substantial tax savings? Yes, Read says - thanks to the opportunities provided by a 21% corporation tax rate, tax credits and the patent box. Brian Binley MP takes up the cudgel again -- demanding answers on where Pfizer would cut costs. Read isn't keen to give details, but says the principle is that you would look at competing products (maybe drop one) and consider which parts of the combined workforce would need more help, and which needs less. Will there be job cuts? Read admits there will be. Yes, we will be efficient by some reduction in jobs - but I can't tell you what or where. Would you do the Astra deal if there wasn't a tax benefit? That would affect the price we would pay, Read replies. And of course, their current offer has been slapped down by Astra. Willie Bain MP gets to the heart of the matter -- the \"fundamental problem\" the committe has is in trusting what you're saying. Ian Read bristles -- never mind about whether the five-year pledges are legally watertight, he shoots back. I am here today to give you my word that we will stick to them, and deliver benefits for the UK. Could the US Congress change the US tax law to prevent Pfizer redomiciling its tax base in the UK through a deal for AstraZeneca. Read says Congress has been pondering this for years. There is a very remote possibility that in the timescale of this deal, the US would change its tax rules, Read suggests. So why did not redomicile in the UK anyway, without a merger? The exit cost would be punitive. An interesting question on the tax implications of the deal. Frank D'Amelio, Executive Vice President, says Britain's corporation tax rate, the tax credits, and the patent box (low tax for products developed in the UK) are all important. So how much will you save? D'Amelio fudges it -- it's early in the process\u2026 very sensitive issue. In recent years our tax rate has been 27-30%. Clearly in the event of a deal, it would be less. So 21%? D'Amelio won't say - as he's not spoken to Astra. MPs remind Pfizer that they've shown their true colours before, in Kent, when they cut 1,500 jobs at the research site there (where viagra was developed). CEO Ian Read replies that those jobs were cut because the site (mens healthcare and respiratory medicines) were no longer crucial to Pfizer. Jonathan Emms, UK managing director, added that Pfizer still has a presence and a commitment to Kent. He even cited that Pfizer helped pay for the local flood defence scheme in the area. See, they're not bad guys at all! Reminder - you can watch the session live here, or on BBC parliament. MPs are kicking the tires on the strength of Pfizer's pledges -- but they are not getting a lot of joy out of Ian Read. Does the promise to keep 20% of R&amp;D staff in the UK mean it will also maintain 20% of R&amp;D spending here? Read says Pfizer is making an \"unprecedented commitment\", when it promises to keep a fifth of the research workforce in Britain. But is that the same as a firth of spending? Read repeatedly won't say. The two companies R&amp;D budgets will be merged globally. Beyond that, it's impossible to say. Read is playing a straight bat, saying he can't make promises as he's not held talks with AstraZeneca yet (as AZ's board have repeatedly told Pfizer to clear off). And he reiterates that a merger would create a stronger company, bring more medicines to patients, and as the firm grows we will keep 20% of R%D workers in the UK. This is all about cutting your tax bill, isn't it? Read repeats that there are strong scientific reasons for the merge -- it's a good deal, a chance to domicile a world-leading Pharma company in the UK. If you don't get government approval for the commitments you are offering , will you walk away from the deal? Read says Pfizer is leaving all its options open. That could include a hostile bid, of course. Now Brian Binley quizzes Read, accusing him of acting like a salesman (Read actually started his career in accounting). How does Read feels about the Swedish government's warning to the UK not to trust Pfizer. In a heated exchange, Binley shushes Read from embarking on a long answer. The short answer is that the Swedes don't have the right facts when they criticise the takeover of Pharmacia. There weren't many R&amp;D jobs based in Sweden when the takeover happened. And the reason we didn't open a new factory is that a key drug didn't get approval. Adrian Bailey also cites the Wyeth deal -- at the acquisition, Wyeth and Pfizer had a $12bn joint R&amp;D spend. It's now $7bn -- is this going to happen with Astra? Frank D'Amelio claims that the true figure was $11bn. What's a billion dollars, replies Bailey. A lot of money, D'Amelio shoots back -- adding that Pfizer is now spending $7bn. Is this deal driven by tax planning? Ian Read claims that the UK low tax rate is only one reason. He insists there are compelling reasons to merge Pfizer and AZ's pipeline -- such as combining Pfizer's oncology drugs, and AZ's exciting early-stage oncology products. He cites Pfizer's purchase of rival Wyeth as proof that Pfizer can be make these deals work. No, since the Wyeth acquisition, we're brought 13 product into the markets, and increased our spending on vaccines. Are you speaking to UK science bodies like the Royal Society (who have serious worries about the deal)? We're talking to individual scientists, Read says. Why didn't you speak to the unions representing AstraZeneca's workers? Read says it was inappropriate given there wasn't a takeover offer yet, only a proposal (that didn't stop them bending the government's ear pretty rapidly). Will Pfizer sustain the current R&amp;D budget of the two companies, at $12bn? After a lengthy answer, Read admits that Pfizer probably won't, he expects it will be lower. How much lower, we won't say. That is not going to reassure critics. Why is Pfizer worth less than it was before various takeovers. Frank D'Amelio, Pfizer's executive vice president, says it has given cash back to shareholders, and sold some divisions off. Next up - the real meat of the day -- Pfizer's management, lead by Ian Read. Adrian Bailey asks Ian Read how he feels about being called a praying mantis, or a shark that can't stop eating rivals. Can the leopard change its spots? Read says he's proud of Pfizer, its record, and what it does for patients. Under his leadership the company realises that its future depends on science, and has a culture of trust, delivering \"impact behaviour\", treating the company's money as our own.' Has the union met with the government? Yes, there's been contact with Vince Cable. And that's the end of the hearing. Brian Binley, Tory MP, says he is shocked that Pfizer has made no official contact with the unions representing AstraZeneca's staff. Has there been any unofficial communication? No. Binley looks most unimpressed. It's \"almost like the workforce is a very poor third\", he says. Tony Burke agrees. Binley then runs through the commitments Pfizer has made - keeping 20% of staff in the UK. Is that really enough? (someone grunts in agreement). The language in these pledges is loose, Binley adds. Is that how Americans are, or are they being evasive? GMB's Allan Black declines to generalise (all countries have bad bosses) - but yes, the commitments aren't very strong at all. AstraZeneca are hammering home the message that they are a crucial part of the UK economy, in their official response to the committee: Both unions say they've not heard anything official from Pfizer -- workers are tracking the takeover through the media. Why did the GMB call for the competition commission to intervene? Allan Black says he was wrong (a tricky thing for a union officer to admit, he jokes). European law means an intervention from the competition authorities is \"almost automatic\". So he didn't need to call for it. Still a jolly good idea, though, he adds. Have you taken legal advice on what proper legal protection would look like? GMB's Allan Black smiles wryly, and replies: Frankly the lawyers at GMB are scratching their heads as to how something could be drawn up that would be suitable watertight to satisfy the government, and which Pfizer would sign off. Even a 10-year pledge would not be good enough, he adds - you need to allow up to 25 years to get a drug from the initial stages to market. Back to Allan Black, National Officer of GMB, who tells MPs that AZ has sent the unions a letter outlining a more realistic, and reassuring, strategy for the UK - including pledges to keep jobs at Macclesfield after the looming move to Cambridge. The history of Pfizer is that R&amp;D budgets have been cut back, even when other companies have maintained spending, says Tony Burke of Unite. That's worrying, when AstraZeneca has such an encouraging pipeline of drugs. Pfizer are not offering the assurances that our members, and the workforce in Macclesfield, Bristol, and across the UK are seeking, he adds. GMB's Allan Black says the current pledges from Pfizer on jobs and research sites have loopholes. The government should insist on much tougher commitments, he says. But ideally, we think the Secretary of State [Vince Cable] should used powers he has, or could get quickly, to stop the deal in the first place. But what should the government demand, then? I'm not sure what commitments could be elicited that would be meaningful, and legally binding, Black admits. Tony Burke of Unite adds that his union found it hard to hold a proper consultation with Pfizer when it shut R&amp;D operations in Kent in 2011. Why did GMB describe Pfizer's pledges as dubious? Allan Black runs through the companies in the US and Sweden which Pfizer acquired, and then cut. It's Pfizer's track record gives me the most concern, rather than the rather flimsy promises made in the letter to the government, he says. Allan Black of GMB points out that there are thousands more contractors working on Astra sites - the true number of staff affected is 14,000, not under 7,000. What do staff think about the prospect of Pfizer taking control? Unite's Tony Burke says they are worried that it would lead to job losses and cutbacks. The reality is these are dedicated workers, dedicated to AstraZenca. They believe their products are world class, and fear that a takeover would mean job losses and could also mean Scientific expertise in the UK is dissipated, he says. How many people to you represent? Tony Burke says Unite represents around a third of Astra's staff. Alan Black of GMB says his union is mainly focused on staff at the Macclesfield site. Chairman Adrian Bailey is surprised to find that there are actually five union representatives in front of him. The extras are: Linda McCulloch, the Unite national office responsible for Pharmaceuticals.. Ian Waddle of Unite. Catherine Speight of the GMB. Hope the spellings are right - there are no namecards for these late additions to the batting order. And the session is underway in the Grimond Room, with Tony Burke, Assistant General Secretary of Unite, and Allan Black, National Officer at GMB, taking their seats. Reminder - MPs will hear from the Unite and GMB unions first, at 9.30am. Then it's Pfizer's CEO Ian Read and other senior colleagues, from 10am. At 11.15am, AstraZeneca's top management take their turn. Then Vince Cable is due at 1pm. Just 10 minutes until the session starts. It will be streamed live on the web, here. Over in the City, the FTSE 100 has hit its highest level since the end of the dot-com boom. Shares in AstraZeneca have risen 1% this morning, to \u00a346.55, following reports that Pfizer could improve its latest offer. My colleague Rupert Neate has pulled together the questions which the BIS committee should ask the bosses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer, and Vince Cable, today. Here's a flavour (Rupert's full piece is here) Questions for Ian Read, chief executive of Pfizer 1 How can you guarantee this takeover will not jeopardise Britain's position in scientific research and development? 2 Are you doing this primarily to avoid a multimillion dollar tax bill in the US? 3 On what grounds would you go hostile? Questions for Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca 1 What reassurances can you give that British R&amp;D will continue to prosper under a stand alone AstraZeneca? 2 If you survive this bid, what assurances can you give us that you won't fall prey to another takeover in the future? 3 You have repeatedly rejected Pfizer's offers and said you want to remain an independent company, yet you have asked the government not to intervene to protect you. Why? Questions for Vince Cable, business secretary 1 How are you going to ensure this does not become another Cadbury-Kraft fiasco? 2 Is the coalition split on how to react to the deal? 3 Does the government have the legal right to intervene? AstraZeneca's defence to Pfizer's advances pinned on its R&amp;D pharmaceuticals pipeline, which it says will yield valuable drugs - and lucrative earnings - in the future. It has bolstered its case this morning, telling shareholders that a new diabetes drug combination called saxagliptin/dapagliflozin had achieved \"positive late-stage trial results. Yesterday it told the City that four drugs for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus were all going well. The message is clear - we have a bright future on our own. Pfizer's appearance at parliament today dominates the UK business pages. The Financial Times reports that MPs will seek a \u2018cast iron\u2019 pledge on Astra jobs. BIS committee chair Adrian Bailey told them that \"We have been bitten once before on Kraft/Cadbury\u201d - a reminder how how another US company broke its pledges on jobs. The Telegraph (\u00a3) says Vince Cable will be urged to tighten up the UK's takeover rules. Tory MP Brian Binley argues that Britain's \"crown jewels\" should get the same protection as other country's prize assets. In The Times (\u00a3), Andrew Clarke points out that the next 48 hours are \"crucial\" for the bid. If Ian Read performs badly, his prized \u00a363bn takeover offer could prove politically impossible. And as flagged up earlier, the Guardian says Pfizer will reiterate its commitment to fostering research - and praise the UK's low corporate tax. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the BIS committee, was pretty scathing about Pfizer in an appearance on Radio 4's Today Programme, a little while ago. Bailey explained that his committee will probe the commitments that Pfizer has made, and see \"just how legally binding\" they can be made (echoing the Royal Society's fears) Pfizer has a track record of buying out foreign firms with good research facilities and closing them down , Bailey said. We must do everything we can to prevent that happening to AstraZeneca. Bailey then gave a taste of the grilling which Ian Read can expect this morning, adding: Pfizer's track record gives no confidence that they can deliver on the promises they have made. The BIS committee will ask Vince Cable (due up at 1pm) on whether he is open to strengthening the takeover code, so that the government can intervene in a takeover if it isn't happy with the pledges being made. And Bailey also pointed to Pfizer's plan to move its tax domicile to the UK, to benefit from our lower corporation tax rate. Again, if you look at Pfizer's history they have a track trrcord of lobbying on tax and doing very well at it, he added. The Royal Society, Britain's prestigious National Academy of Science, has waded into the issue, warning that Pfizer's pledges on jobs and R&amp;D are insufficient. Professor Sir Paul Nurse, the president of the Royal Society and a Nobel Prize winner, has told MPs that Pfizer's promises, which run for five years, are insufficient, according to the BBC. In a letter to the chairmen of the Commons Business and Science Select Committees, Sir Paul Nurse said: \"A commitment of 10 years is required. Science is not a quick-win sector - it requires long-term investment.\" Pfizer has already upped the pressure on AstraZeneca this morning, by going over the board's head and direct to the company's shareholders with a new presentation. In a statement to the City, Pfizer said it was \"remains disappointed at the lack of engagement by the AstraZeneca board\" since its initial approach, back in January. In an unfriendly move, it then declared that AZ would face 'challenges' if it remains independent. Those challenges include \"Predictability of revenue loss\", as drugs yielding $14bn revenue per year lose patent protection, the uncertainty that Astra's \"attractive but high risk\" R&amp;D will produce viable drugs, and a \"potential lack of scale\" to compete against larger rivals. The same could probably be said of most pharmaceuticals firms, I'd suggest. The full statement is here. It's only a presentation, not a formal offer, but it suggests Pfizer is ratcheting up the ante. Here's some instant reaction: Good morning. The battle for AstraZeneca heads to parliament today, as the Business, Innovation and Skills committee grill Ian Read, the boss of Pfizer, over his attempts to take control of the company. It's going to be a lively affair - with MPs also taking evidence from Astra CEO Pascal Soriot, business secretary Vince Cable, and the chiefs of the GMB and Unite unions. We're expecting Read to use his appearance to praise Britain's \"friendly, low-tax\" environment -- more fuel for those inflamed that the deal is driven by tax planning rather than science. He'll also claim that combining the two firms will create a Science powerhouse that can deliver better drugs, faster, to the public. But Read, flanked by senior colleagues, will surely be pressed hard on the various pledges which Pfizer has made to the UK government in an attempt to get the \u00a363bn takeover deal approved. They include keeping 20% of research jobs in the UK, and completing Astra's new headquarters in Cambridge. But memories of the 1,500 job cuts which Pfizer made at its R&amp;D division in Sandwich, Kent, in 2011 have not faded. Can Pfizer really be trusted to keep its word, as it insisted yesterday? (and if you've got to say it, you know you've got a problem). And Soriot will be questioned on his warning that a takeover would be harmful for patients, as it would disrupt AZ's precious pipeline of pharmaceutical. MPs are also expected to urge Vince Cable to tighten up the takeover code -- which critics say make Britain PLC an \"all you can eat\" buffet for foreign predators. Here's the agenda: At 9.30am: Tony Burke, Assistant General Secretary, Unite Allan Black, National Officer, GMB At 10.00am: Ian Read, Chairman and Chief Executive, Pfizer Inc. Frank D'Amelio, Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer, Pfizer Inc. Jonathan Emms, UK Managing Director, Pfizer Inc. At 11.15am: Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca PLC Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice president, Innovative Medicines and Early Development, AstraZeneca PLC Ian Brimicombe, Vice President, Corporate Finance, AstraZeneca PLC At 1.00pm: Rt Hon. Dr Vince Cable MP, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills I'll be tracking all the action through the day.",

His fields of paddy rice, along with those of his village and neighbours, have been designated as a special economic zone. They will be bulldozed to make way for the <a href=\"http://www.jica.go.jp/english/news/press/2014/140423_01.html\" title=\"\">flagship development project</a> of the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) in co-operation with the Myanmar government and Japanese and Myanmar companies. Electronics and garments factories will replace his homestead.</p> <p>U Mya Hlaing does not oppose the project, he just wants to be fairly treated so he can start again with his community, Thilawa, in a new place, so he can bring up his children with enough food to last the year.</p> <p>Instead, he says, the project is moving ahead while the local community is left worse off. He explains that there has been \"no conversation, no replacement land, no adequate compensation\". However, U Mya Hlaing and his fellow villagers are determined. They have seen what happened to their neighbours in the first phase only a year ago: first there were 14-day eviction notices, delayed only when the villagers raised their voices and outside support and media attention forced the Japanese to pressure the Myanmar government to delay the order.

      "bodyText": "U Mya Hlaing sits on a bamboo floor in his rural home an hour down the river from Yangon, explaining how in a short time, he expects to lose it in the name of development. His fields of paddy rice, along with those of his village and neighbours, have been designated as a special economic zone. They will be bulldozed to make way for the flagship development project of the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) in co-operation with the Myanmar government and Japanese and Myanmar companies. Electronics and garments factories will replace his homestead. U Mya Hlaing does not oppose the project, he just wants to be fairly treated so he can start again with his community, Thilawa, in a new place, so he can bring up his children with enough food to last the year. Instead, he says, the project is moving ahead while the local community is left worse off. He explains that there has been \"no conversation, no replacement land, no adequate compensation\". However, U Mya Hlaing and his fellow villagers are determined. They have seen what happened to their neighbours in the first phase only a year ago: first there were 14-day eviction notices, delayed only when the villagers raised their voices and outside support and media attention forced the Japanese to pressure the Myanmar government to delay the order. But this development project went ahead, and about 70 families were relocated to one-roomed tiny houses jammed up against each other. When we visit these houses, Daw Win tells us the relocation is far from what was promised: at midday she hides with the children under the house from the heat, and in the rainy season she fears that they will be in a lake of stagnant water and sewage from their latrines.

      "body": "<h2>1. The mining boom is over and it\u2019s grim</h2> <p>The mid-year fiscal and economic outlook (Myefo) in December 2013 was a document dripping with sadness on the economic front, and the budget continues in that vein. Indeed in some ways it paints an even worse picture of what Australia has in store.<br></p> <p>For all the suggestions of pain for future gain, the budget sees very little gain when it comes to jobs. Not only does the budget predict that unemployment in June this year will be as high as 6.0% (a rise of 0.2% from its current position), it also expects unemployment to rise to 6.25% and stay there right the way through to June 2016.</p> <p>On the broader economic front the budget suggests 2014-15 will be worse than this year. While the economy in 2013-14 is expected to grow by 2.75% (a slightly conservative estimate given annualised growth in the last half of 2013, which was 2.9%), in 2014-15 it\u2019s expected to just trudge along by a mere 2.5%. Only in 2015-16 is the economy expected get back to close to trend growth of 3%.</p> <p>Why are they so gloomy? Well it\u2019s not households. Household consumption has been revised up since the Myefo \u2013 from growth of 2.75% next year to now 3% and 3.25% in 2015-16.</p> <p>So we\u2019re expected to keep shopping. </p> <p>The problem is the end of the mining boom. This budget really throws off any hope that mining might sustain us. In the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook (Pefo) done just prior to the 2013 election, business investment was expected to grow in 2013-14 by 2%. The Myefo revised that down to a fall of 1.5% and the budget has dumped it even further \u2013 estimating a fall of 4%. </p> <p>And things don\u2019t get any better next year. The Pefo expected the end of the mining boom to be a soft fall, with business investment dropping by just 0.5% in 2014-15. The Myefo revised this down to -2% and now the budget takes an even more depressing view and has it falling by 5.5%. And it continues to fall in 2016-17 by another 3.5%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Economic indicators\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/OMuiU/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Those hoping exports would save the day will have to wait \u2013 the budget revised down expectations for growth in exports and massively revised down expectations for the terms of trade (the price we get for exports compared to the price we pay for imports).</p> <h2>2. Revenue is still a problem, but not as bad as it once was</h2> <p>During the 2013 election campaign, the Liberal party claimed there was no such thing as a revenue problem. They suggested that because revenue was actually growing in nominal terms the ALP had nothing to complain about. Well, revenue continues to grow in nominal terms. Over the next four years total government revenue is expected to grow on average by 6.5% \u2013 well above the average annual growth of 3.6% that occurred from 2008-09 to 2013-14.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/i5Ozh/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The government suggests revenue in 2014-15 will be $2.363bn more than was expected in the Myefo due to improvements in company tax revenue and in GST revenue from better than expected household spending. </p> <p>The increase in the income tax for those earning over $180,000 (that is the top 3% of income earners) is expected to raise $3.1bn over the next four years. The reintroduction of the fuel excise is expected to kick in an extra $4bn over the next four years. </p> <p>So all up in percentage of GDP terms, revenue will continue to rise over the next four years from 23.0% in 2013-14 to 24.9% of GDP by 2017-18.

      "bodyText": "1. The mining boom is over and it\u2019s grim The mid-year fiscal and economic outlook (Myefo) in December 2013 was a document dripping with sadness on the economic front, and the budget continues in that vein. Indeed in some ways it paints an even worse picture of what Australia has in store. For all the suggestions of pain for future gain, the budget sees very little gain when it comes to jobs. Not only does the budget predict that unemployment in June this year will be as high as 6.0% (a rise of 0.2% from its current position), it also expects unemployment to rise to 6.25% and stay there right the way through to June 2016. On the broader economic front the budget suggests 2014-15 will be worse than this year. While the economy in 2013-14 is expected to grow by 2.75% (a slightly conservative estimate given annualised growth in the last half of 2013, which was 2.9%), in 2014-15 it\u2019s expected to just trudge along by a mere 2.5%. Only in 2015-16 is the economy expected get back to close to trend growth of 3%. Why are they so gloomy? Well it\u2019s not households. Household consumption has been revised up since the Myefo \u2013 from growth of 2.75% next year to now 3% and 3.25% in 2015-16. So we\u2019re expected to keep shopping. The problem is the end of the mining boom. This budget really throws off any hope that mining might sustain us. In the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook (Pefo) done just prior to the 2013 election, business investment was expected to grow in 2013-14 by 2%. The Myefo revised that down to a fall of 1.5% and the budget has dumped it even further \u2013 estimating a fall of 4%. And things don\u2019t get any better next year. The Pefo expected the end of the mining boom to be a soft fall, with business investment dropping by just 0.5% in 2014-15. The Myefo revised this down to -2% and now the budget takes an even more depressing view and has it falling by 5.5%. And it continues to fall in 2016-17 by another 3.5%. Those hoping exports would save the day will have to wait \u2013 the budget revised down expectations for growth in exports and massively revised down expectations for the terms of trade (the price we get for exports compared to the price we pay for imports). 2. Revenue is still a problem, but not as bad as it once was During the 2013 election campaign, the Liberal party claimed there was no such thing as a revenue problem. They suggested that because revenue was actually growing in nominal terms the ALP had nothing to complain about. Well, revenue continues to grow in nominal terms. Over the next four years total government revenue is expected to grow on average by 6.5% \u2013 well above the average annual growth of 3.6% that occurred from 2008-09 to 2013-14. The government suggests revenue in 2014-15 will be $2.363bn more than was expected in the Myefo due to improvements in company tax revenue and in GST revenue from better than expected household spending. The increase in the income tax for those earning over $180,000 (that is the top 3% of income earners) is expected to raise $3.1bn over the next four years. The reintroduction of the fuel excise is expected to kick in an extra $4bn over the next four years. So all up in percentage of GDP terms, revenue will continue to rise over the next four years from 23.0% in 2013-14 to 24.9% of GDP by 2017-18. It\u2019s worth noting that the ALP governments never had a revenue take of more than 23.2% of GDP. The amount of revenue is actually slightly more than was expected in the Myefo but remains less than the more optimistic figures in the Pefo \u2013 due to the much more negative view of the economy. 3. Expenditure is falling but the cuts overall are not as bad as in the past This was going to be a horror budget. And it is. If you are intending to go to university, if you are under 30 and unemployed, if you are a family with a child over 6, if you go to GPs, you\u2019ll going to be hit hard. Family tax benefits are frozen to save $2.5bn over four years, the threshold for Family Tax Benefit cut from $150,000 to $1000,000 will save $1.2bn, cutting it for families with kids over six saves $1.9bn and the $7 co-payment for GP visits gathers in $3,5bn. The increase in costs to uni students through the deregulation of fees, the cutting of funding to unis and the changes the HECS/HELP repayments $3.2bn But the biggest individual \u201csaving\u201d is through not increasing foreign aid as promised. This saves $7.6bn and is easily the laziest save any government can do. But when we look at the bigger picture number it shows that much of the cuts are done to funnel money elsewhere rather than hurry back to surplus. Expenditure in 2014-15 is expected to decline in real terms by 1.7%, which is among the biggest cuts in the past 40 years. But it\u2019s worth remembering that that cut is in comparison to spending in 2013-14 \u2013 which includes the extra $11.9bn Joe Hockey spent in the Myefo \u2013 including nearly $9bn on the RBA. So that alone made reducing expenditure in this year an easier job. Interestingly, while Wayne Swan did his fair share of shuffling money around to make spending cuts look better, in 2012-13 he actually cut spending by 3.2% in real terms. So he still holds the record for the biggest cuts to expenditure. 4. The trip back to the surplus is steady not stupid Hockey is not rushing back to surplus. Yes he\u2019s putting on the fiscal breaks, but not like Costello did in 1996 to 1999, nor even like Keating did after the \u201cbanana republic\u201d crisis in the late 1980s. The budget deficit will shrink by on average 0.7% of GDP over the next four years. Costello trimmed it by 1% of GDP when he came in \u2013 but he was able to rely on much more revenue growth than Hockey. Spending is expected to be cut each year by on average 0.3% over the next four years. Costello\u2019s cuts to expenditure were double that. So while this certainly is an austere budget \u2013 and very much so for certain sections of the population in broader economic terms it is not the massive slamming on the brakes that it could have been. 5. The economy remains weak, and the government has decided to do little to help Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey suggest that to fix the economy you need to first fix the budget, but there is very little here to suggest the economy is improved in any way by the budget. The budget figures show growth in private sector demand over the next two years is expected to be a pitiful 1.75%. But the government is certainly not stepping into the breach. Public demand is expected to also average just 1.25% - the lowest two year level since 1996-97 and 1997-98. But back then total demand in the economy was expected to grow by nearly 3.5%. By contrast, total demand in 2014-15 and 2015-16 is expected to average just above 1.5%. Hockey may not have cut the budget as hard as might have been expected, but he certainly is no Keynesian. Not for him will the government spend to improve the economic growth in the economy. The big take out from the budget forecasts is that the economy is weak and Hockey is prepared to let it be so.",

The company reported on Tuesday that business passenger numbers had grown by 8.5% since last year, ahead of 4% growth in overall passenger numbers. EasyJet has said its decision to introduce allocated seating on flights has attracted older passengers and business travellers who once shunned the airline. Carolyn McCall, easyJet's chief executive, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that allocated seating was the single most popular thing the airline had done for its customers. Almost 28 million passengers flew with the airline during the six months to the end of March, but business customers are a more lucrative group because they book later and will pay extra for more legroom. The airline's growing popularity with business travellers boosted revenue per seat by 2.6% to \u00a354.80 \u2013 with total revenues up more than 6% to \u00a31.7bn. These new customers also helped the airline to deliver a better-than-expected set of financial results: easyJet reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a353m for the six-month period, compared with \u00a361m the previous year. The airline usually posts a loss from the winter period when fewer passengers fly, but still managed to beat its own guidance, despite the late Easter in 2014. EasyJet's strong performance contrasts with the fate of national legacy carriers and regional airlines that have been cutting back routes. While the airline has added routes to Moscow, north Africa and Israel, increasing capacity by 1.1m seats, its competitors have reduced capacity by 0.9m seats. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: \"The company will continue to load the pressure on rivals, given both its business traveller and general European offerings.\" The outlook also looked favourable for package holiday firm Tui Travel, which reported it had narrowed its losses to \u00a3386m during the winter season, compared to \u00a3410m last year. Tui said sales of its unique holidays were up three percentage points and now account for 70% of all bookings. Unique holidays, in which hotels are offered only through one agent, tend to be more expensive, and helped Tui offset a decline in volume of sales.",

These new customers also helped the airline to deliver a better-than-expected set of financial results: easyJet reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a353m for the six-month period, compared with \u00a361m the previous year.</p> <p>The airline usually posts a loss from the winter period when fewer passengers fly, but still managed to beat its own guidance, despite the late Easter in 2014.</p> <p>EasyJet's strong performance contrasts with the fate of national legacy carriers and regional airlines that have been cutting back routes. While the airline has added routes to Moscow, north Africa and Israel, increasing capacity by 1.1m seats, its competitors have reduced capacity by 0.9m seats.</p> <p>Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: \"The company will continue to load the pressure on rivals, given both its business traveller and general European offerings.\"</p> <p>The outlook also looked favourable for package holiday firm Tui Travel, which reported it had narrowed its losses to \u00a3386m during the winter season, compared to \u00a3410m last year. Tui said sales of its unique holidays were up three percentage points and now account for 70% of all bookings. Unique holidays, in which hotels are offered only through one agent, tend to be more expensive, and helped Tui offset a decline in volume of sales.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Pfizer will today publicly praise the government for creating a friendly, low-tax environment which encouraged the US drugs giant to bid \u00a363bn for AstraZeneca in what would be the biggest foreign takeover of a British company. The Guardian understands that Ian Read, the Scottish-born chief executive of Pfizer, will begin his evidence to MPs in parliament today by praising the government for creating an attractive environment for investment by, among other measures, lowering the corporate tax rate to 20%, compared with 40% in the US. Read will also highlight George Osborne's special \"patent box\" 10% tax rate on products derived from British inventions. His comments are likely to fuel more political outrage on both sides of the Atlantic that Pfizer's takeover plans are partly motivated by saving on multimillion dollar US tax bills. Chuka Ummuna, the shadow business secretary, has accused Pfizer of treating AstraZeneca as a \"pawn in some tax-planning game\". US senator Carl Levin has pledged to close the \"tax inversion loophole\" that Pfizer is planning to take advantage of by relocating its tax domicile \u2013 although not its headquarters \u2013 to London. \"I've long been concerned about inversions \u2013 companies moving offshore on paper, for tax purposes, while the management and operations remain in the US,\" he said. Buying AstraZeneca would allow Pfizer to spend its $63bn (\u00a337bn) pile of cash from overseas profits without bringing it back to America, where it would be subject to US taxes. Adrian Bailey, chair of the Commons business select committee, said Read would be subjected to intense questioning about the tax issue. \"We need to deeply probe this deal,\" Bailey said. \"There are issues about the level of commitment to the UK and how robust they are.\" Read will also praise Britain's position at the forefront of research and development and promise to employ at least 20% of the combined company's R&amp;D workforce in the UK. Despite Pfizer insisting yesterday that the guarantee was \"legally binding\", it would apply for only five years. Bailey said a commitment of just five years was \"inadequate\". \"Virtually all scientific bodies say you need a much longer commitment in order to develop new medicines,\" he said. In its written evidence to the Commons committee, Pfizer said combining the two firms would create and protect high-value jobs. \"With our commitment to foster research and development in the UK, we are matching words with deeds \u2013 and we will keep our word,\" Pfizer said. Read will face further questioning tomorrow when he appears before the science and technology committee. Pfizer said its assurances \u2013 which include completing AstraZeneca's R&amp;D centre in Cambridge and locating some manufacturing in Britain \u2013 were legally watertight because they were published with the takeover proposal for AstraZeneca. Under Britain's takeover code, the pledges created a legal commitment and should \"be given full weight\", Pfizer said. But the US firm, which has a reputation for preferring cuts over investment, offered no new assurances to the government beyond those made in a letter to the prime minister earlier this month. Pfizer has made a string of acquisitions since 2000 that critics said resulted in slashed research spending to boost profits. Pfizer reinforced its reputation as a ruthless operator in 2011 when it announced the closure of its research centre in Sandwich, Kent, with the loss of 2,400 skilled jobs. Anders Borg, the Swedish finance minister, has warned British MPs to take Pfizer's promises with a \"sackful of salt\" after the company reneged on jobs and R&amp;D promises following its takeover of Sweden's Pharmacia. The number of employees there has dropped 90% since the takeover 12 years ago. AstraZeneca has tried to ward off the unwelcome takeover approach by emphasising the opportunities it has to bring new drugs to the market compared with Pfizer. It has warned that research will be damaged if the takeover attempt is successful. Mergers in the drugs industry typically slow scientific development as research is put on hold while the companies decide which activities to cut. In its statement to the business committee, Pfizer praised AstraZeneca's drug development prospects but said the Anglo-Swedish firm needed Pfizer's financial clout to see treatments to fruition. \"Development of pharmaceuticals is an extremely expensive and risky business. AstraZeneca's ability to deliver its pipeline will require very substantial investments during a time when the company's revenues will be declining sharply as a result of the loss of patent exclusivity on important products. A combined Pfizer-Astra-Zeneca would provide a financial engine that could support robust, yet thoughtful R&amp;D investment,\" it said. AstraZeneca has said the US company's interest was a distraction at a time when the former's investment in new treatments was bearing fruit. The British firm set out a plan for revenue growth last week in which it stressed opportunities to treat cancer, diabetes and respiratory illnesses. A poll for the Unite union found only 14% of respondents thought the takeover was in Britain's national interest. The Survation poll of 1,005 people also found that just 19% were confident the coalition was doing enough to safeguard British jobs. Len McCluskey, Unite general secretary, said: \"Pfizer's track record is one of slashing jobs and cutting costs and its 'guarantees' could evaporate at any moment.\" AstraZeneca has twice rebuffed approaches from its US rival. Pfizer's second approach offered \u00a350 a share, mainly in Pfizer's shares, but the company is expected to come back with a new bid this week with a bigger cash element.",

Pfizer reinforced its reputation as a ruthless operator in 2011 when it announced the closure of its research centre in Sandwich, Kent, with the loss of 2,400 skilled jobs.</p> <p>Anders Borg, the Swedish finance minister, has warned British MPs to take Pfizer's promises with a \"sackful of salt\" after the company reneged on jobs and R&amp;D promises following its takeover of Sweden's Pharmacia. The number of employees there has dropped 90% since the takeover 12 years ago.</p> <p>AstraZeneca has tried to ward off the unwelcome takeover approach by emphasising the opportunities it has to bring new drugs to the market compared with Pfizer. It has warned that research will be damaged if the takeover attempt is successful. Mergers in the drugs industry typically slow scientific development as research is put on hold while the companies decide which activities to cut.</p> <p>In its statement to the business committee, Pfizer praised AstraZeneca's drug development prospects but said the Anglo-Swedish firm needed Pfizer's financial clout to see treatments to fruition.</p> <p>\"Development of pharmaceuticals is an extremely expensive and risky business. AstraZeneca's ability to deliver its pipeline will require very substantial investments during a time when the company's revenues will be declining sharply as a result of the loss of patent exclusivity on important products. A combined Pfizer-Astra-Zeneca would provide a financial engine that could support robust, yet thoughtful R&amp;D investment,\" it said.</p> <p>AstraZeneca has said the US company's interest was a distraction at a time when the former's investment in new treatments was bearing fruit. The British firm set out a plan for revenue growth last week in which it stressed opportunities to treat cancer, diabetes and respiratory illnesses.</p> <p>A poll for the Unite union found only 14% of respondents thought the takeover was in Britain's national interest. The Survation poll of 1,005 people also found that just 19% were confident the coalition was doing enough to safeguard British jobs. Len McCluskey, Unite general secretary, said: \"Pfizer's track record is one of slashing jobs and cutting costs and its 'guarantees' could evaporate at any moment.\"</p> <p>AstraZeneca has twice rebuffed approaches from its US rival. Pfizer's second approach offered \u00a350 a share, mainly in Pfizer's shares, but the company is expected to come back with a new bid this week with a bigger cash element.</p>",
