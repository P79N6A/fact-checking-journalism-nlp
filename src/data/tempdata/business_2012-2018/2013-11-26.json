      "bodyText": "Clifford Chance, the \"Magic Circle\" City law firm with links to some of the leading investors in Royal Mail, has been privately analysing the newly floated company's portfolio of 2,000 UK properties. News of the evaluation comes a week after MPs on the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills select committee probed bankers on the value of the newly privatised company's property portfolio, amid criticisms that it may have been undervalued and that Royal Mail sold off on the cheap. Vince Cable and Michael Fallon, the ministers who led the controversial flotation, are set to appear in front of the committee on Wednesday. It is not clear which client has engaged the law firm, but Clifford Chance has previously represented organisations including the Children's Investment Fund and GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, who are two of Royal Mail's largest shareholders. The Guardian understands that Clifford Chance has received a report containing details of around 800 properties held by the Royal Mail subsidiary Royal Mail Estates which are registered with the Land Registry in England and Wales. The portfolio includes a string of sorting offices and plots of land \u2013 such as the Mount Pleasant and Nine Elms sites in central London which are part of three property redevelopment plans already predicted to make Royal Mail around \u00a3300m. Around 95% of the portfolio is freehold property. As a large proportion of the portfolio consists of sorting offices, investors are unlikely to be able to dispose of them for a quick profit as the business needs the sites to operate. However, analysts have estimated that there could be around \u00a3100m of Royal Mail properties that are surplus to requirements, while the fact that the group owns so many freeholds was always likely to attract certain sections of the property industry, at a time when businesses selling their properties for cash and then leasing them back appears to be coming back into fashion. A spokesman for Royal Mail said the company had \"pursued\" sale and leaseback in the past, but it was not currently \"a key part of our strategy\". However, the UK supermarket group Morrisons announced in September that it would review its \u00a39bn property portfolio with a view to doing such a deal. The Morrisons announcement came only five years after Sir Ken Morrison, the chairman who led the company for 50 years, said that sale and leaseback was anathema to the grocer. Aside from the 800 properties registered to Royal Mail Estates, there are further sites in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while the remainder that take the total to 2,000 are largely made up of leasehold sites that Royal Mail has occupied for less than 10 years.

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney: RBS allegations 'deeply troubling and extremely serious'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has described as \"deeply troubling and extremely serious\" allegations that Royal Bank of Scotland has been deliberately wrecking small businesses to make a profit. The Bank of England governor told MPs on the Treasury select committee that if the claims about the bailed out institution proved to be true \"this behaviour is a fundamental violation of the integrity of the banking relationship\". The committee's chairman, Andrew Tyrie, expressed surprise when told by Carney that he had only learned about the allegations recently from Sir Andrew Large, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England who issued a report on RBS lending to small businesses this week. Large's study recommended RBS investigate damaging claims \u2013 also published this week \u2013 that the bank was forcing firms into administration and then acquiring their properties at bargain prices. Tyrie said: \"We as MPs have been inundated with complaints about this for years \u2026 but told that this was not so, there were no supply constraints, that customers were being treated reasonably.\" He added: \"Don't you think it's shocking that these manifest weaknesses and maltreatment of RBS customers had not been picked up much earlier by somebody?\" Carney responded that if the behaviour turned out to be widespread at the bank it was indeed \"remarkable\" and \"shocking\" that it had not been identified sooner by the RBS board, regulators, or UKFI, which manages the government's stakes in both RBS and fellow state-backed bank Lloyds Banking Group. He also conceded it was a failure of governance at a time when governance issues had supposedly been addressed in the wake of the financial crisis. Large's report recommended that the bank investigate claims published this week by an adviser to business secretary Vince Cable, entrepreneur Lawrence Tomlinson, that RBS was killing off small, viable businesses to make a profit. Tomlinson is accusing RBS of forcing businesses into its Global Restructuring Group (GRG) which sells on properties to its West Register division. GRG decides whether a business is beyond turnaround and needs to be put into administration, a process which Large described in his report as \"opaque\". Carney said that the task of investigating the allegations was the direct responsibility of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, and not the central bank itself. However, he said he did not want to downplay a matter that must be pursued \"down to the fullest extent of the law\". He added: \"We take the view that the behaviours documented in the report [and in a separate report from Sir Andrew Large] are deeply troubling and extremely serious.\" He rejected the notion that banks might have been tempted into \"a grey area of banking\" by a requirement to hold more capital to protect themselves against the impact of future potential crises, arguing there was no justification for \"predatory restructuring\". \"There was a need for a number of institutions including RBS to reduce the size of their balance sheet but the big material areas where balance sheet reduction could make the biggest difference were concentrated on their investment banking and international activities as opposed to their core UK activities. \"We welcome the renewed focus of the new RBS senior management on its core retail and UK commercial business. Now they'll have to prove that they can execute that strategy but at least they appear to be concentrated on the right things.\" He said that while the accusations were serious, such behaviour by RBS was unlikely to have an impact on overall productivity in the UK. The governor, who succeeded Sir Mervyn King in July, attended the session with colleagues from the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee to answer questions based on themes raised in the November Inflation Report. When asked whether the RBS allegations were an example of why during the crisis the Bank should have targeted monetary stimulus directly at businesses and not just through the purchase of government bonds, he said: \"I wasn't here so I don't want to make judgments. There are certainly circumstances that one can imagine and we may have seen across the major economies in the course of this crisis where credit-easing type policies would have been particularly effective.\"",

GRG decides whether a business is beyond turnaround and needs to be put into administration, a process which Large described in his report as \"opaque\".</p> <p>Carney said that the task of investigating the allegations was the direct responsibility of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, and not the central bank itself. However, he said he did not want to downplay a matter that must be pursued \"down to the fullest extent of the law\". He added: \"We take the view that the behaviours documented in the report [and in a separate report from Sir Andrew Large] are deeply troubling and extremely serious.\"</p> <p>He rejected the notion that banks might have been tempted into \"a grey area of banking\" by a requirement to hold more capital to protect themselves against the impact of future potential crises, arguing there was no justification for \"predatory restructuring\".</p> <p>\"There was a need for a number of institutions including RBS to reduce the size of their balance sheet but the big material areas where balance sheet reduction could make the biggest difference were concentrated on their investment banking and international activities as opposed to their core UK activities.</p> <p>\"We welcome the renewed focus of the new RBS senior management on its core retail and UK commercial business. Now they'll have to prove that they can execute that strategy but at least they appear to be concentrated on the right things.\"</p> <p>He said that while the accusations were serious, such behaviour by RBS was unlikely to have an impact on overall productivity in the UK.</p> <p>The governor, who succeeded Sir Mervyn King in July, attended the session with colleagues from the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee to answer questions based on themes raised in the November Inflation Report.</p> <p>When asked whether the RBS allegations were an example of why during the crisis the Bank should have targeted monetary stimulus directly at businesses and not just through the purchase of government bonds, he said: \"I wasn't here so I don't want to make judgments. There are certainly circumstances that one can imagine and we may have seen across the major economies in the course of this crisis where credit-easing type policies would have been particularly effective.\"</p>",

This makes comparative exercises harder, both in the case of HIV/AIDS and in the case of suicide rates, another closely watched issue in crisis countries.</p> <p>This WHO case illustrates exactly how this can go wrong and will perhaps serve as a cautionary tale.

The fact that the Budget Commission of the Senate has agreed on approving the Budget, but has not granted mandate, poses serious threats to securing stability and implementing important economic policy measures.</p> <p>This effectively means that a number of amendments have been automatically dropped, including those related to the redefinition of the unpopular property tax. During the night the Government has to do whatever it takes to re-include those amendments \u2013 on which they will attach a vote of confidence \u2013 otherwise Italians will see their taxes increase again without important compensatory measures being passed.</p> <p>At this point, Italy\u2019s troubled economy, with almost unprecedented unemployment rates, has no other choice than to catch the train of feeble economic recovery that starts to be seen elsewhere in Europe.

We have come as far as we can\u201d Azev\u00eado said as he admitted that disputes among the WTO\u2019s 159 member states remain unresolved.</p> <p>The new WTO chief has been trying to breath new life into the stalled Doha round of trade liberalisation talks - which began 12 years ago - by getting an agreement on what were considered the low-hanging fruit from the negotiations - tackling red tape and corruption at customs, easier access to global markets for the world\u2019s poorest countries, and food security.\u201d</p> <p>Previous WTO ministerial meetings in Seattle in 1999 and Cancun in 2003 ended in high-profile failure after trade ministers failed to reach agreement on complex texts in advance. This time, members agreed that all the negotiating had to be done in advance so that a deal could be rubber-stamped in Bali.</p> <p>But <strong>Azev\u00eado</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWe are not going to Bali with a set of finalised documents that could allow the ministers to announce to the world a set of multilaterally agreed outcomes \u2013 the first since the WTO was created. At this point in time we cannot tell the world that we\u2019ve delivered.</p> <p>And I will inform the ministers that we have failed to find convergence. I will tell them that we came truly close to a successful outcome, but that, once more, the finish line eluded us.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>WTO insiders fear that a fresh failure will lead to the splintering of the global trading system into regional blocs.

WHO recognizes that there is no evidence suggesting that deliberate self-infection with HIV goes beyond a few anecdotal cases. The statement is the consequence of an error in the editing of the report, for which WHO apologizes.</p> </blockquote> <p>It continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>WHO also recognizes that Greece reported a significant increase (52%) in new HIV infections from 2010 to 2011, largely driven by infections among people who inject drugs. The causes for this increase are multifaceted and WHO welcomes the work of the ad hoc expert group and other entities to improve understanding of them and to recommend appropriate measures to extend the benefits of the comprehensive package of interventions for harm reduction to all people who inject drugs.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So how did it happen?</strong> Well, WHO referred to a report in The Lancet - <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61556-0/fulltext\"><strong>online here</strong></a> - which itself cited another \"authoritative report\" from Greece which \"described accounts of deliberate self-infection by a few individuals\", who wanted to receive higher benefits and earlier access to drug treatment clinics.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ewsd.wiv-isp.be/Rapid%20communications%20%20extra%20information/Report%20of%20the%20Greek%20FP%20expert%20group%20-%20AIDS.pdf\"><strong>That report, by the&#xa0;AD HOC EXPERT GROUP OF THE GREEK FOCAL&#xa0;</strong></a><a href=\"http://ewsd.wiv-isp.be/Rapid%20communications%20%20extra%20information/Report%20of%20the%20Greek%20FP%20expert%20group%20-%20AIDS.pdf\"><strong>POINT, was written in 2011 and is online here</strong></a>:</p> <p>It analysed the causes of a rise in&#xa0;HIV/AIDS cases, and blamed a series of factors including the economic crisis, needle-sharing, and heightened police 'sweeps' in Athens that hampered health workers from reaching drug users.

Resign!\" from the public gallery as the finance minister spoke.The ruling centre-right coalition has a comfortable majority in parliament, so the budget passed easily. But all the other parties, including the main opposition Socialists, whose government had requested the bailout in 2011, voted against.The opposition has vowed to challenge a range of key spending cuts in the Constitutional Court after the passage.</p> <p>\"This budget will be remembered as a constitutional provocation,\" Socialist leader Antonio Jose Seguro told parliament shortly before the vote.</p> <p>The court had shot down several austerity measures, but late on Monday upheld one contested measure that increases the work week for the public sector. Still, increasing the work week to 40 hours from 35 hours will have little effect on this and next year's budget, while measures that could be challenged are worth an estimated 1.3 billion euros, or a third of all next year's budget savings.</p> <p>\"What is certain is that key austerity measures will end up with the court, and I think it can still deliver surprises, both to those on the left and to those on the right,\" said Adelino Maltez, a political scientist at Lisbon's Technical University.</p> <p>Nicholas Spiro, managing director at Spiro Sovereign Strategy consultants in London, said the court's rulings \"hang over Portugal's reform programme like a sword of Damocles\".</p> <p>President Anibal Cavaco Silva had already begun the court process over the weekend, by asking for a review of a planned cut in public-sector pensions that make up a key part of next year's savings. That was a law separate from the budget, and the court now has 25 days to review it.</p> <p>Any new rejection by the court would force the government to hunt for alternative measures. The administration has repeatedly said there is no 'plan B' to find alternative revenues. But local media have reported one possibility is raising value-added tax again on many products, which could undermine an economy just recovering from its worst downturn since the 1970s.</p> <p>Portugal's lenders - the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank - have also identified challenges by the court as potentially the biggest threat to Lisbon's efforts to exit the bailout in 2014.</p> <p>\"Six months away from the end of the programme, we are starting to get out of an emergency situation and projecting a more promising future. It's no time to give up,\" Finance Minister Maria Luis Albuquerque said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5294ac6fe4b0ae67c83cc8c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-26T14:15:02.750Z\">2.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nida Ali, economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club,</strong> says we didn't get much clarity on forward guidance from the Bank today.</p> <p><strong>She comments:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Governor and MPC members reiterated what we already knew \u2013 that they believe forward guidance is working because people are not considering an interest rate rise now and that unemployment reaching 7% is only a threshold and not an automatic trigger for a rate rise.</p> <p>In our view, these arguments do not hold much water.

Doing this job properly is made harder by the fact that countries like Greece have never had a strong record in collecting this type of data, even when times were better (according to numerous UN reports). This makes comparative exercises harder, both in the case of HIV/AIDS and in the case of suicide rates, another closely watched issue in crisis countries. This WHO case illustrates exactly how this can go wrong and will perhaps serve as a cautionary tale. But Mr. Limbaugh\u2019s listeners are unlikely to read this blog post, and may go on believing Greeks are giving themselves HIV/AIDS for 950 bucks a month. WHO False Claim of Greeks Giving Themselves HIV/AIDS Goes Viral Zoe Mavroudi, screenwriter and documentary maker, has also recorded how the WHO's correction evolved through the afternoon, before finally settling on the key facts that there is \"no evidence\" for the claims behind a few anecdotal cases -- and an apology for the error. Dr Giovanni Melina, Lecturer in Economics at City University London, is also worried about the situation in Italy tonight. The confidence over over the 2014 budget is a serious threat to Italy's prospects: The vote on the decadence of Senator Berlusconi as an MP, scheduled for tomorrow, is overshadowing a much more important measure being taken by the Italian Senate. Indeed, tonight will be a crucial night for the financial stability of Italy and the whole Euro area. The fact that the Budget Commission of the Senate has agreed on approving the Budget, but has not granted mandate, poses serious threats to securing stability and implementing important economic policy measures. This effectively means that a number of amendments have been automatically dropped, including those related to the redefinition of the unpopular property tax. During the night the Government has to do whatever it takes to re-include those amendments \u2013 on which they will attach a vote of confidence \u2013 otherwise Italians will see their taxes increase again without important compensatory measures being passed. At this point, Italy\u2019s troubled economy, with almost unprecedented unemployment rates, has no other choice than to catch the train of feeble economic recovery that starts to be seen elsewhere in Europe. The spectre of indiscriminate austerity posed by this split on the budget may result in dangerously prolonging the recession, with further dramatic consequences for Italy and negative spill over effects on the EU. Over in Italy tonight, Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party have withdrawn from the coalition government -- ahead of a vote tomorrow on his expulsion from the Italian Senate. Forza Italia lawmaker Paolo Romani told reporters that the party could no longer support PM Enrico Letta's economic policies, saying: The conditions for remaining in the ruling coalition no longer exist. This means Letta's coalition has a much narrower majority of just 7 seats. Berlusconi's MPs are due to oppose the government in a confidence vote over the 2014 budget due tonight. The government should survive that vote, though, given the split within Berlusconi's party which saw around 60 MPs stick with deputy PM Angelino Alfano. Even with Alfano's support, though, it will be harder for Letta to get legislation through. And Berlusconi is widely expected to be hoofed out of the Senate over his tax fraud convictions, having failed to win a last-minute pardon or judicial review of his case. Europe's stock markets have closed in the red, led by a chunky drop in London. FTSE 100: down 58 points at 6636, -0.87% French CAC: down 24 points at 4277, -0.57% German DAX: down 9 points at 9290, -0.1% David Madden of IG says that Mark Carney's latest defence of interest rate forward guidance couldn't prevent a bout of profit-taking: Reassurances from the Bank of England that interest rates will not be raised in a hurry could not convince traders to hold onto yesterday\u2019s gains. Investors decided to secure their profits after a deal was struck between Iran and the west. The mining sector has lost nearly 2% and finds itself the weakest sector on the London market today, as softer metal prices are weighing on mineral extractors. European stocks are relatively strong after comments from Mr Coeure of the ECB hinted that negative interest rates could be used to get the region into shape. The Office for National Statistics has responded to the criticism of its performance made by Treasury committee chair Andrew Tyrie, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney, this morning: A spokesman said: ONS seeks to ensure all of its economic statistics meet the highest standards. ONS is examining ways to produce new statistics on the flow of funds between various sectors of the economy. ONS maintains a regular dialogue with the Bank of England and welcomes all views on how ONS's statistics can better meet the needs of users. This one could run and run.... Is the writing on the wall for the multilateral trading system? Hopes that a package of measures will be agreed at next week\u2019s World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in Bali are hanging by a thread after talks in Geneva reached an impasse, writes our economics editor, Larry Elliott. Here's Larry's full take on the situation: Roberto Azev\u00eado, the WTO\u2019s director-general, has now told trade ministers that it is now up to them to show the political will needed to prevent the meeting ending in failure. \u201cWe have reached the end of the process in Geneva. We have come as far as we can\u201d Azev\u00eado said as he admitted that disputes among the WTO\u2019s 159 member states remain unresolved. The new WTO chief has been trying to breath new life into the stalled Doha round of trade liberalisation talks - which began 12 years ago - by getting an agreement on what were considered the low-hanging fruit from the negotiations - tackling red tape and corruption at customs, easier access to global markets for the world\u2019s poorest countries, and food security.\u201d Previous WTO ministerial meetings in Seattle in 1999 and Cancun in 2003 ended in high-profile failure after trade ministers failed to reach agreement on complex texts in advance. This time, members agreed that all the negotiating had to be done in advance so that a deal could be rubber-stamped in Bali. But Azev\u00eado said: \u201cWe are not going to Bali with a set of finalised documents that could allow the ministers to announce to the world a set of multilaterally agreed outcomes \u2013 the first since the WTO was created. At this point in time we cannot tell the world that we\u2019ve delivered. And I will inform the ministers that we have failed to find convergence. I will tell them that we came truly close to a successful outcome, but that, once more, the finish line eluded us.\u201d WTO insiders fear that a fresh failure will lead to the splintering of the global trading system into regional blocs. Already talks are underway for a trans-Pacific and an EU-US trade deal. Azev\u00eado said: \u201cFailure in Bali will have grave consequences for the multilateral trading system. Most of you know this. \u201cWe will fail not only the WTO and multilateralism. We will also fail our constituencies at large, the business community and, above all, the most vulnerable among us.\u201d The World Health Organisation has admitted it was completely wrong to claim that half of new HIV cases in Greece were deliberately caused by Greeks intentionally infecting themselves to receive benefits. This remarkable claim surfaced in the media yesterday, in an official WHO report from September called Review of social determinants and the health divide in the WHO European Region. It stated that, in Greece: \u201cHIV rates and heroin use have risen significantly, with about half of new HIV infections being self-inflicted to enable people to receive benefits of \u20ac700 per month and faster admission on to drug substitution programmes\u201d. Here's the full report - the claim is made on page 112. This caused a storm last night, and early this morning, despite scepticism that it could be true. WHO has now admitted it was simply wrong, and apologised. In fact, what is accurate to say is that slightly more than half of the Greece\u2019s new HIV cases are among those who inject drugs. WHO recognizes that there is no evidence suggesting that deliberate self-infection with HIV goes beyond a few anecdotal cases. The statement is the consequence of an error in the editing of the report, for which WHO apologizes. It continues: WHO also recognizes that Greece reported a significant increase (52%) in new HIV infections from 2010 to 2011, largely driven by infections among people who inject drugs. The causes for this increase are multifaceted and WHO welcomes the work of the ad hoc expert group and other entities to improve understanding of them and to recommend appropriate measures to extend the benefits of the comprehensive package of interventions for harm reduction to all people who inject drugs. So how did it happen? Well, WHO referred to a report in The Lancet - online here - which itself cited another \"authoritative report\" from Greece which \"described accounts of deliberate self-infection by a few individuals\", who wanted to receive higher benefits and earlier access to drug treatment clinics. That report, by the AD HOC EXPERT GROUP OF THE GREEK FOCAL POINT, was written in 2011 and is online here: It analysed the causes of a rise in HIV/AIDS cases, and blamed a series of factors including the economic crisis, needle-sharing, and heightened police 'sweeps' in Athens that hampered health workers from reaching drug users. And also: \"The well-founded suspicion that some problem users are intentionally infected with HIV, because of the benefit they are entitled to (approximately \u20ac 1,400 every two months), and also because they are granted \u201cexceptional admission\u201d to the Substitution Programme.\" So, a suspicion in 2011 became a bold fact in the WHO report - which is quite an editing error. And was seized on by some media outlets. As WHO spokesman, Gregory H\u00e4rtl, put it to Associated Press: This was just a gross editing error for which the WHO apologises. Adding to the general confusion, the WHO has been editing its original correction through the afternoon. A press spokesperson for Who/Europe in Copenhagen just explained to me that they've been liaising with the global HQ in Geneva over the precise wording. This is the final version: Correction to HIV case study in Greece featured in WHO/Europe report on social determinants of health We should also credit Media Matters for debunking the WHO claim last night, here. Meanwhile in the eurozone.... the Portuguese government has managed to get its 2014 budget through parliament - probably teeing up a series of court challenges against the latest austerity measures. A majority of MPs in Lisbon approved the budget this afternoon, while anti-austerity protesters gathered outside the parliament building. Reuters has the details: Several thousand unionists and pensioners converged in front of the building to protest the budget's public-sector wage and pension cuts, which follow tax hikes and spending cuts already under way. Inside, a small group chanted \"Resign! Resign!\" from the public gallery as the finance minister spoke.The ruling centre-right coalition has a comfortable majority in parliament, so the budget passed easily. But all the other parties, including the main opposition Socialists, whose government had requested the bailout in 2011, voted against.The opposition has vowed to challenge a range of key spending cuts in the Constitutional Court after the passage. \"This budget will be remembered as a constitutional provocation,\" Socialist leader Antonio Jose Seguro told parliament shortly before the vote. The court had shot down several austerity measures, but late on Monday upheld one contested measure that increases the work week for the public sector. Still, increasing the work week to 40 hours from 35 hours will have little effect on this and next year's budget, while measures that could be challenged are worth an estimated 1.3 billion euros, or a third of all next year's budget savings. \"What is certain is that key austerity measures will end up with the court, and I think it can still deliver surprises, both to those on the left and to those on the right,\" said Adelino Maltez, a political scientist at Lisbon's Technical University. Nicholas Spiro, managing director at Spiro Sovereign Strategy consultants in London, said the court's rulings \"hang over Portugal's reform programme like a sword of Damocles\". President Anibal Cavaco Silva had already begun the court process over the weekend, by asking for a review of a planned cut in public-sector pensions that make up a key part of next year's savings. That was a law separate from the budget, and the court now has 25 days to review it. Any new rejection by the court would force the government to hunt for alternative measures. The administration has repeatedly said there is no 'plan B' to find alternative revenues. But local media have reported one possibility is raising value-added tax again on many products, which could undermine an economy just recovering from its worst downturn since the 1970s. Portugal's lenders - the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank - have also identified challenges by the court as potentially the biggest threat to Lisbon's efforts to exit the bailout in 2014. \"Six months away from the end of the programme, we are starting to get out of an emergency situation and projecting a more promising future. It's no time to give up,\" Finance Minister Maria Luis Albuquerque said. Nida Ali, economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, says we didn't get much clarity on forward guidance from the Bank today. She comments: The Governor and MPC members reiterated what we already knew \u2013 that they believe forward guidance is working because people are not considering an interest rate rise now and that unemployment reaching 7% is only a threshold and not an automatic trigger for a rate rise. In our view, these arguments do not hold much water. Given how far the level of GDP is below trend, it\u2019s very unlikely that markets would be considering a rate rise now, despite the positive economic trends seen recently. Furthermore, financial markets are still likely to believe that unemployment touching 7% will lead to an increase in the interest rate. According to the Governor, his interaction with businesses suggests that they are clear on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy stance and on forward guidance. While this could potentially encourage businesses to spend, we think it\u2019s important for the Bank to communicate effectively to convey its message to financial markets as well. Five key points from the Bank of England's appearance at the Treasury select committee  1) Governor Mark Carney has expressed deep concern over accusations that a division of Royal Bank of Scotland deliberately undermined and destroyed business customers for profit. In his first public comments on the allegations made in two reports (one by the Bank's own former deputy governor, Sir Andrew Large), Carney said they were \" both deeply troubling and extremely serious.\" He said: It's the direct responsibility of the FCA to conduct an appropriate investigation. I know the institution itself is conducting their own investigation but authorities need to be involved and that's absolutely necessary This has to be tracked down to the full extent of the law. Carney also dismissed the defence that RBS was under pressure to rebuild its capital reserves. There's no excuse for \"predatory restructuring\", he said, as: This behaviour is a fundamental violation of the integrity of the banking relationship. 2) MPs remain unconvinced by forward guidance. Perhaps Carney should consider wearing a t-shirt with \"7% is a threshold, not a trigger\" printed on the front, for his next appearance at parliament. Once again, the governor found himself defending his forward guidance on interest rates with the usual explanation that it provides certainty and clarity. The committee does not share Carney's view. The exchange between Carney and Brooks Newmark MP was pretty tasty. Newmark saying Carney had hurt the Bank's credibility, and promptly accused of \"a total failure of logic\". Ee'll find out in 2014 or 2015 who is right. 3) Is the Office for National Statistics fit for purpose? Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie had stinging criticism for the ONS, saying that the statistics body was failing to provide the Bank of England with the data it needed. Carney conceded that the situation could be better. Here's his full reply (via Reuters) There's been an adjustment in the last six months or so to the deflator used to translate from nominal to real investment. And the consequences of that has been that the picture of investment, both historically and present, has changed quite substantially, and actually the path of investment in the UK is now much more volatile apparently than it is in other major advanced economies. We have put cautionary language in our reports in August and in November in terms of how much weight we're putting on that data. We're not putting full weight on that data and it has to be said that it doesn't entirely feel right that investment is, as measured, falling at a time when we see continued strengthening investment intention. There is a lot of work, it would appear, that needs to be done to bring the flow of funds data here up to the international standards and to the level that we need. And then the real blow: I was much more comfortable with the data in Canada. 4) Carney's upbeat talks has raised Westminster hackles With an election just 18 months away, Labour may be concerned that the chancellor becoming a Tory cheerleader. John Mann MP was fairly blunt in criticising governor for declaring two weeks ago that the recovery was gathering pace, without acknowledging the time it has taken to reach here and the debts which have been incurred en route. Carney may have grinned when he flatly denied nursing political ambitions (there have been rumours), but there was no levity by the end of the exchange when he said he was \"more than mildly offended\". Labour members of the committee also voiced concerns about a pro-City speech Carney gave in October, to mark 125 years of the Financial Times. Future comments from the governor will be closely scrutinised as polling day approaches.... 5) Carney is eager to get his hands on a leverage ratio for UK banks. The opening exchange focused on this morning's news that George Osborne has asked the Bank's Financial Policy Committee should start reviewing the 'leverage ratio' (controls on how much capital a UK bank should hold, relative to its lending) now, rather than in four years time. Carney said he believed leverage ratios were a great way of avoiding financial meltdown, saying: If I could pick one element that was essential to the performance of the Canadian banking system during the crisis it was the presence of a leverage ratio. We see that this power is consistent and in fact necessary to properly implement a robust capital framework in the United Kingdom. Andrea Leadsom's final question to Mark Carney didn't get into the blog at the time. She reminded the governor that the Bank's senior ranks exclude half the population (they're all male). Would he like a list of 100 highly capable women who could bolster its expertise? Carney says that he welcomes recommendations from \"anyone\" to \"reinforce human capital\" at the BoE, adding that gender imbalance is a key part of a review taking place now into how it runs. And that was the end of the session, after more than two and a half-hours of questioning. Andrew Tyrie's opening remark at 10am hat the meeting might occupy \"most of the morning\" proved a little conservative. Harder than it looks, forward guidance...... Round-up of the key points to follow. A reminder that highlights start here. And you can see a playback of the whole session here. And finally, Mark Carney gets the Scottish question. Andrea Leadsom MP asks the Bank of England governor for his views on Alex Salmond's plan for independence, in which Scotland would keep the pound but run its own fiscal policies. Can you squeeze two fiscal plans into one currency? Carney tries to wriggle out of it, saying that he's been \"riveted\" to his duties to the Treasury Committee and hasn't had time to digest Salmond's proposals which were announced this morning (liveblog here). That won't satisfy Leadsom, who gently insists that Carney shares his wisdom. So, the Bank of England governor answers the question - framing his reply within the context of the eurozone crisis. He says there are \"many lessons from the crisis period\" which show the kind of attributes a currency union needs to be successful. That includes \"some fiscal federalism\", says Carney, citing the proposed eurozone banking union as a step along the way. Ultimately, in the fullness of time, more fiscal federalism will be needed to create a fully viable euro, Carney concludes. He makes no direct comment on the Scottish situation -- goodness knows what John Mann would have concluded about Carney's political ambitions if he had! Over to Andrea Leadsom MP, who asks whether the eurozone can ever fully recover without proper banking union. Spencer Dale, the Bank of England's chief economist, replies that the best hope for the eurozone is weak growth over the next few years, regardless of the situation in its banks. But can you ever have a successful currency union without full fiscal union? Dale replies that you can, in certain circumstances, and they are \"political circumstances\" not economic ones. On how the Bank's QE programme will be unwound -- deputy governor Charlie Bean says it will not start to sell gilts until it sees a sustained recovery. It may not happen 'just after' the first interest rate rise. On the housing market, Carney strikes an upbeat tone - saying that there are signs of momentum spreading from London and the South East. He concedes that housing starts remain low -- in Canada*, he says, the rate is twice as high even though the population is half the size. That supply issue - whether it's a lack of builders, a lack of land, a lack of bricks - needs solving. There's a lot more space in Canada, mind you, he adds. * - is Carney getting nostalgic for home after more than two hours in the Thatcher Room? Andrew Tyrie returns Mark Carney to his comment that the former deputy governor Sir Andrew Large first became aware no more than six weeks ago that RBS might have been deliberately hurting small firms. We have been hearing complaints from constituents for much longer than that, governor, Tyrie says. Carney (who joined the bank in the summer), agrees that it would be \"remarkable\" and \"shocking\" that RBS's treatment of small firms wasn't picked up earlier if, as feared, it took place on a wide scale. Tyrie: Isn't this a failure of governance, at at time when we're being told that governance is being cleaned up? Governor Carney says that reforming the 'senior person's regime' (how bankers in influential positions) is a key target for the Bank, and also the FSA watchdog. John Mann MP goes on to ask Mark Carney what ambitions he has in the political field. Carney grins, and replies: None, none whatsoever, thank you. That's followed by a clash over Carney's claim that the UK recovery is stronger than other advanced economies. That's just wrong, Mann says, citing India and China. They're not advanced economies, Charlie Bean points out. Mann then cites OECD and IMF data that the US is growing faster - Carney denies it. Mann: you're sounding more like a politican than a governor Carney: No, I'm making sure the record is accurate It all turns a little nasty in the Thatcher Room, with Mann pointing out that the UK's recovery is simply later than other countries, and driven by rising indebtedness. He suggests that Carney is acting as a cheerleader for the government, contrasting him to Mervyn King who was much less optimistic about the economy. Carney says he's \"more than mildly offended\" by the thrust of Mann's question, that he's too close to the chancellor, George Osborne. Mervyn King, he adds, had plenty of reasons for pessimism - including a recession, and high inflation. The picture is different today. John Mann MP asks when Sir Andrew Large, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, first alerted Mark Carney to his concerns over RBS. It was a month, or six weeks ago, he replies. That's also when the FCA was notified, Carney adds. Could RBS could have been forced into cutting healthy firms adrift, as is alleged, because of the pressure to cut its lending book and recapitalise? Mark Carney says this is no defence at all for the kind of \"predatory restructuring\" that RBS is accused of. If true, this behaviour is a fundamental violation of banking integrity and the 'banking relationship'. Bank of England governor Mark Carney says the latest allegations against Royal Bank of Scotland are deeply worrying, and should be pursued fully by independent authorities. Asked by the Treasury committee for his views on yesterday's report from Lawrence Tomlinson, which suggested that RBS had deliberately driven healthy firms to the wall, Carney replied: We take the view that the behaviours documented in the report [and in a separate report from Sir Andrew Large] are deeply troubling and extremely serious. It is the direct responsibility of the FCA to investigate, Carney continued, saying that RBS can't be left to simply look into it themselves. Authorities need to be involved, he added. Could this actions from RBS have contributed to the UK's weak productivity? Carney says that it would have had some impact on a macro-economic level, which underlines how the allegations must be \"tracked down to the full extent of the law\". However, Carney doesn't believe the scale of what apparently went on would have hit \"overall productivity\". Onto the question of zombie companies - firms who are clinging onto life because monetary policy is so loose. Ben Broadbent says that loose policy has been a good thing overall, and suggests that some viable firms might have been swept away by it. Mark Carney chips in too - saying that as the recovery picks up, the lost opportunity of supporting zombie firms rather than healthier ones increases. MPC member Ben Broadbent challenges the validity of the data showing that massively more loans go to financial firms (24%) than factories (1.4%). Much of the former is 'rolling over' loans rather than funding new expansion, he says. George Mudie MP wants to know what the Bank is doing to get more loans to small firms. Why isn't it more concerned that the government's Funding for Lending scheme appears to be driving mortgage lending over SME loans? Carney indicates that we'll get more details on this issue on Thursday, when the Bank's Financial Policy Committee holds its own press conference. Mark Carney being challenged again over his October speech (online here) in which he said that financial services should remain at the heart of the UK economy. George Mudie MP criticises this \"lauding\" of the City, and reminds the governor of recent figures showing that 24% of lending goes to other financial institutions, 43% to housing, 10% to real estate, and just 1.4% to manufacturing. Aren't we going down the same old road as before the crash? Another long answer from Carney - the point seemed to be that it's important that Britain has a robust financial system, robust banks..... and we are seeing improvements being made. Back to productivity, and Mark Carney says that international prospects aren't as rosy as the bank would like. The eurozone is effectively stagnating, he says, while emerging market growth has been revised down. In that case, asks David Ruffley MP, how long can consumers provide the impetus for the UK recovery without creating problems for the future? Carney explains that consumer demand will help stimulate business investment -- but admits that unless we get overseas demand, the recovery will be rather modest. Andrew Tyrie asks whether the Bank of England is happy with the quality of data it receives from the Office for National Statistics. Carney struggles to respond at first (we get an umm, and a  ), before suggesting that we can all improve. Tyrie demands a better answer - suggesting the governor should stop talking in code and say whether he's happy or not. Carney says he has been struck by the \"challenges\" posed for policy setting in some areas by the official data. The bank isn't putting the \"full weight\" on the ONS's official investment data. The data on how funds flow between different parts of the UK needs to be brought up to international standards, he adds. In short, the governor says, there is room for improvement. Killer question from Tyrie -- Was it better in Canada? I was much more comfortable with the data in Canada (where he was governor before being plucked to run Threadneedle Street), Carney replies . So the answer is yes? Pretty much, Carney concedes. Deputy governor Charlie Bean tries to ride to the ONS's defence, saying that its resources have been squeezed by the recession. It may not be as good as it was. Tyrie suggests that the ONS is providing inaccurate, out of date data -- and asks the Bank to write to him with their recommendations to improve the situation. Ben Broadbent (an 'external' member of the bank's monetary policy committee) also offered support for Carney's forward guidance, saying he personally signed up \"lock, stock and barrel\", and does not see inflationary dangers. John Thurso MP makes an interesting point, on whether the productivity problems in the UK stem from the City sucking the brightest minds into it, rather than industry. Thurso says he visited Rolls-Royce recently, and were told that it only managed to hire 700 people of the calibre it needed because of the recession. A reminder that the session is online, here. Deputy governor Charlie Bean is now at the crease, fielding questions about the output gap in the UK economy. Bean says that productivity is the \"single biggest puzzle\" about the UK economy today, suggesting that the Bank's brightest minds are still trying to understand why productivity was so weak since the crisis began. He adding that \"we have no idea how big the output gap is\" - which makes it hard to understand how the economy will behave as the recovery picks up. The key thing with our forward guidance on interest rate rises, Bean insists, isn't growth, it's whether we can see a significant pick-up in slack. Carney is asked about a Reuters poll that found a majority of economists think the handling of forward guidance (which he introduced, of course, in his early days at the Bank) has hurt the Bank's credibility. The governor replies that he's not familiar with the poll*, but shoots back with another poll that shows three quarters of people understand that the 7% unemployment target is a threshold, not a trigger. As Carney put it, in another gloves-off moment: Let's flesh out who's confused about this. The markets, he suggests, have not priced in an interest rate rise in a way they would have done without forward guidance (given recent decent economic data) * - there are details here, governor. Spencer Dale is also backing forward guidance on interest rates, saying people in the real economy appreciate the increased certainty it gives. They don't worry that we'll raise rates until conditions are better, or raise them quickly them when we start. He also cites spare capacity in the economy as another reason to hold rates. Are you moving away from using the unemployment rate as the main target? Dale says not. Chief economist, Spencer Dale, denies that the Bank has given up on targeting inflation -- in a recent speech, he admitted it could be a double-edged sword. Brooks Newmark challenges Carney, pointing out that the forecasts in the latest inflation report show a 40% chance that the unemployment rate will drop to 7% by the final quarter of 2014. That's nine month's earlier than the Bank thought in August. \"How much damage has this caused to the Bank's credibility\", asks Newmark, suggesting that Carney's forward guidance was already \"dead on arrival\". Carney is highly unamused and unimpressed, replying: That is a total failure of logic, Mr Newmark. Carney repeats his usual defence of his pledge not to consider a rate rise until the unemployment market has improved -- that it gives households, firms, market participants a view of the conditions that the Bank needs to see before considering a rate rise. We are not going to pull the rug out from under the recovery before it gets going. Carney goes on to point out that many workers would rather work longer hours -- that top-line figure of 7.6% doesn't always tell the full story. The 7% unemployment target in our forward guidance is a threshold for considering a rate rise, not a trigger, Carney adds. Onto forward guidance, and a question from Brooks Newmark MP. Does the recent fall in the unemployment rate to 7.6% in the third quarter of 2013, faster than the Bank's earlier forecasts, means an interest rate rise is more imminent than we though? Carney welcomes the fall in joblessness, towards the 7% target set by forward guidance. But no, it does not change the guidance - and he wouldn't get carried away by unofficial data showing that the rate fell to 7.1% in September alone. Andrew Tyrie asks whether Carney was consciously setting a new tone from his predecessor in his speech in October on how the BoE will deal with the financial sector. Carney give a long answer, saying that his strategy builds on Lord King's legacy. But he creates the impression, certainly in Tyrie's mind, that the short answer was 'yes'. This speech is online here. Do we really want such a large UK financial sector anyway, asks Pat McFadden, harking back to the problems Britain suffered after 2008 from an unbalanced economy. Carney claims that a big, strong City is good for us all. The jobs created are spread across the country, he claims. The City helps UK firms penetrate international markets by giving them capital. It does help our creative industries by funding new markets. And it is positive for exports -- covering some of the UK's large deficit in goods trading. McFadden homes in on this with a double-whammy of facts -- 50% of the lending goes to property of one form or another, while just 1.4% goes to manufacturing. This is affecting the characteristics of the UK economy, surely? Carney doesn't accept that a properly-run financial services affects the rest of the economy. What other powers would help protect the UK banking sector, asks Pat McFadden MP, reminding Carney of a recent speech on the future of the UK financial sector. 1) Ending \"Too big to fail -- including changing the capital structures of the largest banks. So that debt holders are also exposed to losses, after shareholders, to avoid taxpayers picking up the bill. These are the same BAIL-IN powers that are getting a lot of attention in the euro area. 2) Ensuring resilience in the various financial markets that simply ceased functioning when the 2008 crash struck. They need to keep working in such circumstances (as the equity markets did, allowing shares to tumble rather than trading simply ceasing) McFadden isn't too impressed, suggesting it's all too esoteric for the man in the street. Carney insists that both points are important. If an institution makes a mistake, it should bear the full consequences. We need to make changes to really end Too Big To Fail. And fixing the \"plumbing\" of the financial markets will also help avoid a repeat of the credit crunch. Get it wrong, and the size of the UK's financial services industry will suffer. Andrew Tyrie wants more details on the timing -- will the BoE's FPC have these powers by June 2015? Carney says he expects it within this parliament (which should indeed end then). So, as far as the bank is concerned, is the transfer of power a \"done deal\" subject to parliamentary approval, Tyrie asks. Carney agrees, saying that this would be \"consistent and necessary\" to maintain capital levels. But, Tyrie says, producing Osborne's letter (on which the printer ink may still be dripping), the chancellor is asking \"whether\" the FPC should have these powers as well as how. He suggests Carney has ignored the first part and moved onto the second part. Tyrie asks Carney to explain this morning's exchange of letters about the leverage ratio (see earlier post). The governor explains that that Bank has agreed to hold a review on the implementation of a leverage ratio on UK banks. The 'expedited' review will have three elements: 1) whether to have one. The Bank's view is that it's an integral part of bank regulation -- Carney says it helped protect banks in Canada. 2) How it should change related to the risk-based capital of banks -- Should it change related to issues such as 'ring-fencing banks' (splitting casino banking away from high street banking). Carney reckons it should- rather than being a fixed 3% limit 3) Timing. How the UK's implementation of these rules should fit with other countries. Some issues are still being discussed in international forums, including how \"bailin-able debt\" will interacts with other debt on the books. Most of these factors should be resolved in the next three quarters, says Carney, who adds that he welcomes the Chancellor's approach today. And we're off, with chairman Andrew Tyrie warning that we have \"a lot of ground to go over\". It could take all morning..... A reminder that we'll be hearing from Dr Mark Carney, Governor, Charlie Bean, Deputy Governor, Monetary Policy, Spencer Dale, Executive Director and Chief Economist, and Dr Ben Broadbent, Member, Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England The Treasury committee hearing in the Thatcher Room is about to start -- it's being live-streamed here Interesting.... the Treasury has announced that it has asked the Bank of England to review the leverage ratio being imposed on UK banks. And the tone of George Osborne's letter to Mark Carney suggests that the chancellor may not want higher ratios imposed in the UK than abroad -- another sign that Mervyn King's legacy at the Bank is unravelling? Leverage ratios effectively measure a bank's lending relative to capital available to cover losses. Under the Basel 3 rules, banks must maintain a minimum \"leverage ratio\" of 3%, by 2019. Lord King, in his final days at the Bank, pushed the target date to be brought forward, and also suggested he'd support a rather higher ratio. In his letter to Carney, Osborne asked the Bank's FPC to assess what powers it needs over the leverage ratio. He added that he believes the UK should be in line with international rules, and the international timescale. If the FPC wants a higher leverage ratio, or an earlier implementation, Osborne wants to see \"clear evidence\" that it will improve UK financial security. In his reply, Carney agreed that the time is right to review leverage ratios. Leverage ratios have also caught the eye of the Treasury committee -- so Mark Carney may get a question on that too. Economic news from Italy -- consumer confidence has risen this month, after taking a nasty dip in October, but people are more worried about future economic prospects. ISTAT reports that its consumer morale index rose to 98.3, up from 97.3, with people reporting their view of the current economic climate, and unemployment, had improved. However, sentiment on future outlook deteriorated. Italy's economy has been shrinking for the last nine quarters, with a 0.1% drop in GDP in the third quarter of this year. Statement here. Not much else to report in the markets this morning. The FTSE 100 has dipped a little, down 14 points at 6680, while the French and German markets are flat. Overnight, the Nikkei fell 0.6% while the Chinese markets slipped slightly. IG's Stan Shamu blamed \"a lull phase as uncertainty and caution prevail along with some mild profit taking\". Hugo Boss is also blaming problems in China for disappointing profit forecasts. The German fashion chain's chief exec told investors in Hong Kong this morning that it won't hit its target of \u20ac750m operating profits until 2015, not next year as planned. Shares in Hugo Boss have dropped by 3.5% in early trading. CEO Claus-Dietrich Lahrs called China a \"particular concern\", admitting that the days of rampant growth in its luxury goods market were over.... Apologies for the earlier typo, and many thanks to the rival journalist - and baerchen below - for flagging it up. R\u00e9my Cointreau's shares have slumped by 7.5% after the drinks firm gave investors a nasty hangover, reporting disappointing demand in the key Chinese market. The cognac and spirits firm admitted that it expects to suffer a \"substantial double-digit decline\" in operating profits in the current financial year. It blamed a slowdown in China, and the tricky economic climate in Europe, saying: In an uncertain economic environment in Europe and against the backdrop of a sharp slowdown in China, which remains impacted by high inventory levels in distribution and poor short-term visibility, the business environment will be less favourable in the second half of the year. R\u00e9my Cointreau's operating profits have already fallen by 7.3% in the first six months of this financial year, including a 10% drop in sales of R\u00e9my Martin (again, China gets the blame). The latest word is that profits could be down by a fifth by the end of the year: 08:50:11RTRS - REMY COINTREAU RCOP.PA SAYS EXPECTS FULL YEAR OPERATING PROFIT TO DECLINE BY 20 PCT OR SLIGHTLY MORE - CEO RCOP.PA Other drinks firms are also suffering -- with SAB Miller leading the fallers on the FTSE 100, down 1.7%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is up before MPs this morning to answer questions on the Bank's view of the UK economy. Officially, Carney and colleagues will be updating the Treasury select committee on the Bank's latest quarterly inflation report, which declared that the UK's economic recovery was becoming more secure. As Carney put it two weeks ago: For the first time in a long time, you don't have to be an optimist to see the glass as half full. But we also expect a few tough questions on Carney's precious 'forward guidance' - that the bank won't consider raising interest rates until the jobs market improves. The Treasury committee didn't seem too impressed with the whole notion the last time they quizzed the governor. And surely Andrew Tyrie, committee chair, will seek Carney's views on some of the latest problems to hit the UK banking sector -- from the crisis at Co-op Bank to the allegations that RBS deliberately brought small firms down to make a profits. Deputy governor Charlie Bean, chief economist Spencer Dale, and MPC member Ben Broadbent are also attending. The session starts at 10am GMT. Britain's energy market is also in focus today, with my colleague Terry Macalister reporting that RWE npower has pulled out of a huge offshore windfarm in the Bristol Channel. A blow to the UK's environmental ambitions, and raising the prospect that green subsidies (levied via energy bills) may need to be raised to make such projects more viable. \u00a34bn wind turbine plan axed in green energy blow The chief exec of Ofgem may get a few questions on the issue when he appears before MPs this morning -- a day after a report found total profits and profit margins rose last year. Elsewhere.... in the financial markets, most of Monday's initial enthusiasm over the Iranian nuclear deal has now dissipated, with oil and gold bouncing back from yesterday's lows. As Kit Juckes of Societe Generale remarked: +1 We'll also have our usual focus on Greece. As we covered in last night's live blog, the country's finance minister has vowed to reach a deal with its troika of lenders before it takes over the EU presidency in January. Still not clear how the difference of opinion over Greece's fiscal gap in 2014 will be resolved. I\"ll be tracking all the developments through the day, focusing on Mark Carney's hearing from 10am.",

All they are doing is buying the other retailer's property portfolio.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe bottom line here is formal. One company, Men\u2019s Wearhouse, does a better job than the other. The theory is they will add more formal expertise to Jos A Banks. But so what?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Davidowitz also argues that the combined entity may face competition issues. When Whole Foods bought smaller rival Wild Oats in 2007, the federal trade commission stepped in arguing the deal eliminate \u201cthe substantial competition between these two uniquely close competitors.\u201d The deal was held up for years and Whole Foods eventually sold the chain.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll argue that Macy\u2019s and others are all in formalwear, but Whole Foods made the same points about WalMart and others,\u201d said Davidowitz.</p> <p>The main advantage of a deal will be cost-cutting in a tough sales environment. Jos A Bank has more than 600 stores, about half as many as Men's Wearhouse. The two would be able to combine back office functions such as purchasing and close unprofitable stores while keeping a wide geographic spread. Men\u2019s Wearhouse said Tuesday it would save $100m to $150m in \u201csynergies\u201d through improving purchasing, optimizing customer service and marketing practices, and streamlining corporate functions.</p> <p>The proposed deal comes after a tumultuous spat in Men's Wearhouse\u2019s boardroom. In June, George Zimmer, the retailer's chairman, was ousted from the company he co-founded 40 years ago. The gravel-voiced Zimmer was the face of Men\u2019s Wearhouse and famous for TV ads and his catchphrase: \u201cYou\u2019re going to like the way you look. I guarantee it.\u201d</p> <p>The board said Zimmer had wanted full control of the company. After he was ousted Zimmer hit back saying he had argued against the direction the company was taking and \"the board has inappropriately chosen to silence my concerns.\"</p>",

While the dance continues, some retail analysts are wondering whether the two parties have had a few too many pre-dinner martinis. \u201cIt\u2019s insane,\u201d said veteran retail consultant Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz &amp; Associates. \u201cWhen you make an acquisition, you want to carve out a new growth area,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a retail deal, it\u2019s a real estate deal. All they are doing is buying the other retailer's property portfolio.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line here is formal. One company, Men\u2019s Wearhouse, does a better job than the other. The theory is they will add more formal expertise to Jos A Banks. But so what?\u201d he said. Davidowitz also argues that the combined entity may face competition issues. When Whole Foods bought smaller rival Wild Oats in 2007, the federal trade commission stepped in arguing the deal eliminate \u201cthe substantial competition between these two uniquely close competitors.\u201d The deal was held up for years and Whole Foods eventually sold the chain. \u201cThey\u2019ll argue that Macy\u2019s and others are all in formalwear, but Whole Foods made the same points about WalMart and others,\u201d said Davidowitz. The main advantage of a deal will be cost-cutting in a tough sales environment. Jos A Bank has more than 600 stores, about half as many as Men's Wearhouse. The two would be able to combine back office functions such as purchasing and close unprofitable stores while keeping a wide geographic spread. Men\u2019s Wearhouse said Tuesday it would save $100m to $150m in \u201csynergies\u201d through improving purchasing, optimizing customer service and marketing practices, and streamlining corporate functions. The proposed deal comes after a tumultuous spat in Men's Wearhouse\u2019s boardroom. In June, George Zimmer, the retailer's chairman, was ousted from the company he co-founded 40 years ago. The gravel-voiced Zimmer was the face of Men\u2019s Wearhouse and famous for TV ads and his catchphrase: \u201cYou\u2019re going to like the way you look. I guarantee it.\u201d The board said Zimmer had wanted full control of the company. After he was ousted Zimmer hit back saying he had argued against the direction the company was taking and \"the board has inappropriately chosen to silence my concerns.\"",

A new breed of private pension schemes, which are built on monthly contributions, will be undermined if younger workers stay unemployed for long periods, said the Paris-based thinktank. As it warned that babies born today will live until 100 years of age on average and retire at 70, the OECD said the weakness of the British state-funded system meant workers in the UK were among the most vulnerable. Stefano Scarpetta, an employment specialist at the OECD, said: \"It is of great concern that many countries are building contributory pension systems when they have large numbers of unemployed young people who cannot contribute and will have very low retirement incomes.\" His comments came as the OECD said that on most measures, the UK ranks in the bottom half of the pensions league table.

Italy has the highest spending on pensions as a proportion of GDP whereas the Netherlands, which has a large private and workplace pensions top up, has the highest standard of living for retirees. To tackle long-standing weaknesses in the UK retirement system, the thinktank said the government has one of the most comprehensive pension reform programmes in the developed world. While other countries have focused on tackling the growing burden of future pension costs by raising the state pension age or improving incentives for older workers to stay in the jobs market, the UK has pursued every avenue to both improve the lives of older people and cut the cost of providing them with a decent income, said the OECD. The Paris-based organisation said in its report Pensions at a Glance 2013 that the UK had raised the average incomes of people above the retirement age and introduced plans to expand coverage through the workplace pension savings scheme Nest, which is expected to automatically enrol 10 million workers over the next three years. But it said the knock-on effect of policy reforms, many of which protect the benefits accrued by older workers at the expense of young employees, was that in many OECD member countries younger workers were now more at risk of poverty than retirees. \"Pension reforms made during the past two decades lowered the pension promise for workers who enter the labour market today.

Young people who cannot contribute in their early working life will find their retirement incomes suffer badly. It said Poland and Hungary had ditched schemes that rely on stock market returns while the UK, the Czech Republic and Israel have expanded them. In many countries older workers have come to see their homes as a potential source of income in retirement, whether following a sale or through equity release. The OECD said it was not clear how prevalent or effective housing would be to boost incomes and countries needed to \"explore in greater detail how housing and financial wealth can contribute to the adequacy of retirement incomes\". The thinktank also highlighted the benefit of public services to retirees and especially lower income groups. It said governments needed to win public support for public service provision that allows older people to continue working and living a decent life. \"Public support is set to play an increasingly important role in preventing old-age poverty among people requiring health and long-term care services,\" it said. A rise in the retirement age to 67 in the UK means state expenditure is only expected to increase by 0.5% over the next 40 years to 8.2% of GDP, well below the OECD average of 11.7%.",

Wright acknowledged \"deep distrust\" of the big six energy companies \u2013 British Gas, npower, SSE, Scottish Power, E.ON and EDF \u2013 as some customers face price rises of more than 10% as winter kicks in. Addressing MPs on the Commons energy and climate change committee, Wright said rising prices, years of aggressive doorstep selling, confusing tariffs and complexity when consumers wanted to switch providers had all created negative perceptions of the industry. \"I completely understand why people feel frustrated and angry about rising energy bills. Prices have more than doubled over the last 10 years at a time when incomes have been squeezed, and consumers are not convinced that price increases that they see are either fair or justified,\" he said. \"Consumers have a perception that the market is not working well and that's something that we agree with. We think the retail market is not working as well as it should do.\" When asked whether Ofgem was a \"toothless tiger\", failing to address rising prices and accusations of unfair profit taking among companies, he said it was acting within its statutory regulatory framework and rejected the idea he was supportive of the rises. \"I never said it was OK. I have not said this level of profit is right or acceptable. If companies imply we think 5% is right, we've never said that.\" He said that politicians were right to debate the issue of rising energy price rises but when questioned about Labour leader Ed Miliband's promise to freeze prices he did not appear to be enthusiastic. \"The sort of things we would consider are, does it have an adverse impact on consumers and on the investment that's needed? \"It is obviously necessary to allow companies to recover the revenues that they need to be able to run their businesses effectively. They should have no guarantee of profits but an efficient business serving customers should be able to recover the costs that they incur. So any arrangement that doesn't allow them to do that potentially puts at risk investment in the industry.\" His comments came a day after Ofgem published a report which found that profits per customer rose by 77% last year, from \u00a330 to \u00a353, driven by higher prices and increased demand for heating during last year's cold weather. The average profit margin for supplying energy to households in 2012 was 4.3%, up from 2.8% in 2011, with total profits from supplying energy to households and businesses rising from \u00a31.25bn to \u00a31.6bn last year.",
