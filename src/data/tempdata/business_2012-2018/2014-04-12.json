      "bodyText": "Lord Myners dramatically quit the Co-operative Group's board after being accused by a board member of damaging sales by talking down the mutual's brand, the Observer has learned. The former Labour City minister quit just four months after being brought in to reform the troubled chain of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies. The dispute centred on an interview Myners gave to the Guardian in which he claimed that the Co-op's reputation as a business run by its members was a myth. He went on to tell the paper that the company's most senior managers were left to waste billions of pounds on disastrous corporate transactions because the directors drawn from the Co-op movement were not qualified to keep them in check. \"Few of them have any serious business experience and many are drawing material financial benefits from their positions,\" he said. The unnamed board member told Myners, in front of others at a board meeting on Wednesday, that revenue from the sale of goods had been hit by Myners's attack. A source said: \"That intervention appears to be what led Myners to suddenly quit the board.\" It is understood that Myners had also caused ill-will among the regional boards, whose support was crucial to push through his vision of reform. A source said there had been considerable upset that Myners had not visited any of the regional boards, or joined conference calls that his own office had organised for the regional boards to discuss his own proposals, which included tearing up the existing boardroom structure and replacing it with a plc-style model. Myners, who was chairman of the Guardian Media Group until 2008, when he joined the Labour government at the height of the financial crisis, was brought in with a mandate to draw up a blueprint for a new-look Co-op that will be put to its members in June. His resignation came hours after members of the Co-op voted to remove the three directors who approved the controversial \u00a36.6m pay packet for the chief executive, Euan Sutherland, who quit last month after that deal was leaked to the Observer. Meg Hillier MP said in parliament last week that two other executives at the Co-op were on unjustifiable remuneration packages. \"Alistair Asher, who is now the Co-operative Group's general counsel, was formerly a partner at Allen &amp; Overy, where he was involved with building society demutualisation. He may have worked on demutualisations in the past, but the Co-op does not want to demutualise. \"Another member of the team is Nick Folland, the director who deals with communications,\" she said. \"Both those men have been given a retention package of more than \u00a31m this year and next year that is not performance-related. I repeat that such gross, over-inflated handouts must stop.\" A Co-op spokesman said he could not confirm or deny that Myners had been challenged over a fall in revenues.",

      "bodyText": "The supermarket business is conducted in the language of wars \u2013 price wars \u2013 so embattled Tesco boss Philip Clarke probably needs to channel his favourite military hero if he is to survive the barrage heading his way. With Tesco shares languishing at a 10-year low and the UK's biggest retailer due to report a second year of falling profits on Wednesday, Clarke, like Montgomery at El Alamein, is facing a crucial stand \u2013 but at a time when his leadership is being called into question. One former director offers a scathing critique: \"I have no idea what Tesco's strategy is and the execution has been crap. Everybody knows Philip is not going to turn around the UK business, apart from the Tesco board.\" When Clarke replaced Sir Terry Leahy in 2011 it triggered the biggest leadership change at the retailer in almost a generation. Three years on, the Tesco lifer, with 40 years' experience under his belt, is the last man standing from the Leahy era and the sole executive director on a board where once there were eight. The scale of the management clearout means that when Clarke reports profits down to \u00a33.2bn compared with \u00a33.5bn a year ago, he will have no one left to blame. He alone will have to provide the answers as to why, after spending more than \u00a31bn on store refurbishments, extra staff and new product ranges, market share, at 28.6%, is \u2013 like the share price \u2013 at a 10-year low. There is no question that Clarke is trying to turn around the 3,000-store UK business at a difficult time. The industry is being rocked as shoppers turn their backs on big stores; the sprawling Extras that helped Tesco conquer Britain in the 00s are now a millstone around his neck. Clarke has sought to put the brakes on big store openings and focusing investment on convenience stores and its website. He still has the backing of big investors who accept a business of Tesco's size takes time to turn around. \"I know our business is getting better and there is a lag between it being better and people talking about it,\" he said recently. To boost interest, he has been making space for trendy brands such as Harris + Hoole coffee shops and Giraffe restaurants, as well as nail bars and soft play areas. Although not without merit, one analyst describes these moves as \"fiddling while Rome burns\" and the former director agrees: \"Philip Clarke confuses activity with progress. In a \u00a370bn turnover business, these initiatives amount to a hill of beans.\" While many Tesco stores look smarter today, analysts say it is the price of what's on the shelves that is the real problem; shoppers appear to have no problem with Aldi's and Lidl's workmanlike interiors. In February, Tesco said it would spend an additional \u00a3200m lowering prices of staples such as bread, milk and eggs, but an in-depth study by analysts at Espirito Santo found the retailer to be \"more expensive than Waitrose\", the PM's favourite grocer. Espirito Santo's Rickin Thakrar said Tesco was guilty of using \"baffling\" offers to bamboozle shoppers who had to do a \"multibuy landmine dance\" to get the best deal on fruit and vegetables. To save money on a price per kilo basis, including promotions, a customer would need to buy onions singly, peppers in packs of three, pears singly, packs of plums, loose red chillis and carrots, a sack of potatoes, loose broccoli, a pack of oranges, and individual mushrooms, he said of Tesco's pricing maze. Tesco's problems have not been confined to the home front. Once famous for flag-planting around the globe, the business under Clarke has pulled out of the US and Japan and is in the process of restructuring its Turkish operation. Previously strong businesses in central Europe and Asia have unravelled while it has even lost its market leadership to Musgrave in Ireland. The change in shopping habits in Poland is if anything more dramatic than in the UK. \"Poland is like the UK on steroids with very strong competition from local discounter Biedronka,\" says Bryan Roberts, director of retail insights at Kantar Retail. \"Obviously the economy hasn't been helpful but there has been a huge flight to the discounters; and, like here, the hypermarket model is under a degree of pressure.\" Industry insiders blame Tesco's loss of form on the fact that it has haemorrhaged talent at the senior level; some claim Clarke's tough management style has crushed what used to be a team culture. They also point to weak leadership from chairman Sir Richard Broadbent. Given the challenges faced by the sector, they say it now misses the expertise of heavyweights such as David Potts, Tim Mason, Andy Higginson, Carolyn Bradley and Richard Brasher \u2013 all key lieutenants in the Leahy years. \"The board needs clearing out,\" says one industry source. \"The chairman has been a disaster and they need to face that. This is an issue of national importance. Tesco is the country's biggest private-sector employer and it is being run by a bunch of incompetents.\" Clarke appears to accept he won't have a long tenure at Tesco, unlike Leahy, who ran it for 14 years. \"You only have a job like this for a few years,\" he said. \"I'm not a young man. I'm 54 \u2013 I've given it 40 years.\"",

But the bubble burst, partly thanks to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates.

For the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/mar/14/internetipos.internet\" title=\"\">lastminute.com flotation</a> of 2000, which turned out to be a perfect signal for investors to start selling, read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/03/just-eat-shares-rise-flotation\" title=\"\">Just Eat</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/26/aocom-floats-stock-market-john-roberts\" title=\"\">AO World</a>, or perhaps even lastminute itself, since its current loss-making parent, Sabre Corporation, is planning an imminent $5bn flotation.</p> <p>For the Fed raising interest rates then, read the gradual trimming \u2013 or \"tapering\" in the vernacular \u2013 of its monthly bond-buying programme now.</p> <p>So last week we saw the technology-heavy Nasdaq fall by 3.1% on Thursday, its biggest daily decline since 2011. The much-hyped tech stars were among the hardest hit, with Facebook falling 17% from its recent high in April and Twitter losing a quarter of its value over the same period.</p> <p>In the UK, recently listed Just Eat, Boohoo and AO World were afforded hefty valuations when they made their market debuts, but now stand at or below their flotation prices.</p> <p>There have been several explanations for the slide, from suggestions that investors were cashing in to pay taxes on their recent gains \u2013 also one of the reasons put forward for the March 2000 slide, as it happens \u2013 to a realisation that many company valuations were wildly out of kilter with reality.</p> <p>Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank is probably on the money when he suggests much of the decline is due to the Fed: \"As it becomes ever clearer that the Fed is pretty much fixed in its determination to stop quantitative easing late this year, the oxygen that has fuelled the five-year bull market is slowly draining out \u2026 Those sectors that have done best since the bull market/high-liquidity period started are suffering in the recent correction.\"</p> <p>There are other concerns of course. Russia's actions in Ukraine are also creating uncertainty, with talk of troop buildups and the cutting of gas supplies indicating that the crisis could get worse before it gets better. China is showing signs of a slowdown in growth, albeit from high levels, and this is likely to knock back the global recovery and, in turn, company earnings. Again, businesses with the highest valuations are likely to suffer the most if they struggle to meet earnings forecasts in an economy that is slowing.</p> <p>As Reid points out, the Nasdaq technology and biotech indices have soared 254% and 281% since the lows of March 2009. Over the same period the broader S&amp;P 500 has risen 177%.</p> <p>And the recent slump has reflected this. The S&amp;P 500 has lost 3.1% since its peak earlier this month, while the technology and biotech indices are down 5% and 20% respectively.</p> <p>The pattern is the same in the UK, with the FTSE 350 technology hardware index down more than 8% while the FTSE 100 has fallen by just 1.5%.</p> <p>So we are not in a bear market: that is defined as a fall of more than a fifth from the most recent peak. And a few days of decline does not mean it is time to call the market turn. But the warning signs are there \u2013 and it is a foolhardy investor who pays them no heed while forgetting the past.</p> <h2>Diageo needs more bottle</h2> <p>The film <em>Whisky Galore!</em> sees crafty Hebrideans hide thousands of bottles of holy water from the authorities after a shipwreck disgorges a mountain of single malt. Next week, Scotland's biggest whisky producer is likely to pull off a similar disappearing act when it comes to the question of independence.</p> <p>Asked about the subject last year, the former chief executive of Diageo \u2013 maker of Bell's and Talisker \u2013 said a go-it-alone vote would make \"no difference\" to any decision on investing north of the border. \"Scotch has been around for hundreds of years, it has seen all kinds of political changes. We'll weather anything,\" said Paul Walsh. His successor, Ivan Menezes, has been similarly abstemious in his comments, despite the Scotch Whisky Association joining the debate last week.</p> <p>Such a laid-back approach to a pivotal moment in Scotland's future makes you wonder if the board has been nipping at its private Dalwhinnie supply. It is puzzling given the potential consequences of a yes vote on 18 September \u2013 an outcome gaining credence among some neutral observers. Standard Life, the Edinburgh financial services group, has warned that it might quit Scotland in the event of a breakaway, while BP said an independent Scotland would almost certainly see it face higher costs and an uncertain investment environment. Following the intervention this month of Glasgow-based industrial giant Weir Group, Diageo's refusal to engage meaningfully is leaving a significant hole in the debate.</p> <p>Voters should certainly ask Menezes for a more frank assessment of the economic ramifications. In order to succeed as a standalone economy, Scotland will need a vibrant export industry. With exports of around \u00a33.5bn per year, whisky is second only to oil and gas in sending Scottish goods abroad, while it also supports more than 30,000 jobs in the country.</p> <p>So Diageo's insouciance in the face of the thorny monetary-union question is hard to believe. The company owes the country an honest answer on the independence question. Unlike the plot of <em>Whisky Galore!</em>, this is not a jolly&#xa0;caper.</p> <h2>That's the way the pasty crumbles</h2> <p>Two years ago, David Cameron held one of his most surreal press conferences when a briefing about the London Olympics was hijacked by questions over the \"pasty tax\" \u2013 George Osborne's ill-fated budget proposal to impose VAT on hot&#xa0;food.</p> <p>\"I am a pasty eater myself. I go to Cornwall on holiday. I love a hot pasty,\" he said. As his defence of the threatened comestible gathered steam in front of startled hacks, Cameron added that he once bought one of the delicacies offered by the West Cornwall Pasty Company \u2013 \"I was in Leeds station at the time\" \u2013 only for it to transpire that the branch had in fact shut years before. But now that former Leeds footballer Danny Mills has been confirmed as one of the new owners of the chain, he will know where to open a new branch. There is at least one potential repeat customer out there.</p>",

For the Fed raising interest rates then, read the gradual trimming \u2013 or \"tapering\" in the vernacular \u2013 of its monthly bond-buying programme now. So last week we saw the technology-heavy Nasdaq fall by 3.1% on Thursday, its biggest daily decline since 2011. The much-hyped tech stars were among the hardest hit, with Facebook falling 17% from its recent high in April and Twitter losing a quarter of its value over the same period. In the UK, recently listed Just Eat, Boohoo and AO World were afforded hefty valuations when they made their market debuts, but now stand at or below their flotation prices. There have been several explanations for the slide, from suggestions that investors were cashing in to pay taxes on their recent gains \u2013 also one of the reasons put forward for the March 2000 slide, as it happens \u2013 to a realisation that many company valuations were wildly out of kilter with reality. Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank is probably on the money when he suggests much of the decline is due to the Fed: \"As it becomes ever clearer that the Fed is pretty much fixed in its determination to stop quantitative easing late this year, the oxygen that has fuelled the five-year bull market is slowly draining out \u2026 Those sectors that have done best since the bull market/high-liquidity period started are suffering in the recent correction.\" There are other concerns of course. Russia's actions in Ukraine are also creating uncertainty, with talk of troop buildups and the cutting of gas supplies indicating that the crisis could get worse before it gets better. China is showing signs of a slowdown in growth, albeit from high levels, and this is likely to knock back the global recovery and, in turn, company earnings. Again, businesses with the highest valuations are likely to suffer the most if they struggle to meet earnings forecasts in an economy that is slowing. As Reid points out, the Nasdaq technology and biotech indices have soared 254% and 281% since the lows of March 2009. Over the same period the broader S&amp;P 500 has risen 177%. And the recent slump has reflected this. The S&amp;P 500 has lost 3.1% since its peak earlier this month, while the technology and biotech indices are down 5% and 20% respectively. The pattern is the same in the UK, with the FTSE 350 technology hardware index down more than 8% while the FTSE 100 has fallen by just 1.5%. So we are not in a bear market: that is defined as a fall of more than a fifth from the most recent peak. And a few days of decline does not mean it is time to call the market turn. But the warning signs are there \u2013 and it is a foolhardy investor who pays them no heed while forgetting the past. Diageo needs more bottle The film Whisky Galore! sees crafty Hebrideans hide thousands of bottles of holy water from the authorities after a shipwreck disgorges a mountain of single malt. Next week, Scotland's biggest whisky producer is likely to pull off a similar disappearing act when it comes to the question of independence. Asked about the subject last year, the former chief executive of Diageo \u2013 maker of Bell's and Talisker \u2013 said a go-it-alone vote would make \"no difference\" to any decision on investing north of the border. \"Scotch has been around for hundreds of years, it has seen all kinds of political changes. We'll weather anything,\" said Paul Walsh. His successor, Ivan Menezes, has been similarly abstemious in his comments, despite the Scotch Whisky Association joining the debate last week. Such a laid-back approach to a pivotal moment in Scotland's future makes you wonder if the board has been nipping at its private Dalwhinnie supply. It is puzzling given the potential consequences of a yes vote on 18 September \u2013 an outcome gaining credence among some neutral observers. Standard Life, the Edinburgh financial services group, has warned that it might quit Scotland in the event of a breakaway, while BP said an independent Scotland would almost certainly see it face higher costs and an uncertain investment environment. Following the intervention this month of Glasgow-based industrial giant Weir Group, Diageo's refusal to engage meaningfully is leaving a significant hole in the debate. Voters should certainly ask Menezes for a more frank assessment of the economic ramifications. In order to succeed as a standalone economy, Scotland will need a vibrant export industry. With exports of around \u00a33.5bn per year, whisky is second only to oil and gas in sending Scottish goods abroad, while it also supports more than 30,000 jobs in the country. So Diageo's insouciance in the face of the thorny monetary-union question is hard to believe. The company owes the country an honest answer on the independence question. Unlike the plot of Whisky Galore!, this is not a jolly caper. That's the way the pasty crumbles Two years ago, David Cameron held one of his most surreal press conferences when a briefing about the London Olympics was hijacked by questions over the \"pasty tax\" \u2013 George Osborne's ill-fated budget proposal to impose VAT on hot food. \"I am a pasty eater myself. I go to Cornwall on holiday. I love a hot pasty,\" he said. As his defence of the threatened comestible gathered steam in front of startled hacks, Cameron added that he once bought one of the delicacies offered by the West Cornwall Pasty Company \u2013 \"I was in Leeds station at the time\" \u2013 only for it to transpire that the branch had in fact shut years before. But now that former Leeds footballer Danny Mills has been confirmed as one of the new owners of the chain, he will know where to open a new branch. There is at least one potential repeat customer out there.",

While the reds of Liverpool may be on the verge of revisiting erstwhile glories after a rather inauspicious couple of decades, the red and blue of Tesco seems intent on performing the opposite trick \u2013 and its abundance of problems will get a good airing again on Wednesday at the grocer's results. Apart from the issues affecting the sector (pesky German discounters, too many large out-of-town sites, how to do digital) Tesco is shedding market share while giving the appearance of having about as much control of its business as its punters do of the trolleys. Nine days ago the supermarket's finance director, Laurie McIlwee, resigned after suggestions he and Clarke are not best pals, and there were further hints last week (albeit denied) that there might be another unexpected item in the bagging area \u2013 with reports that marketing chief Matt Atkinson could be usurped. That's par for this course, but the feeling is that Clarke \u2013 who has already replaced almost every senior executive from the former Sir Terry Leahy regime \u2013 is running out of people to blame the problems on. His \"every belittle helps\" strategy may have reached the end of its shelf life. Can a visionary dreamer keep Burberry in check? Here's Christopher Bailey, the chief creative officer at Burberry, in a corporate video made last year unveiling him as the fashion group's chief executive elect: \"We have done a lot of dreaming \u2026 We have only just started dreaming.\" Amazingly, the film was not a joke \u2013 fashion folk really do like to speak like that \u2013 but it may turn out that the market starts dreaming about Bailey's sainted predecessor, current boss Angela Ahrendts, who is sauntering off to Apple. She'll be gone by next month, the company says, which may mean Ahrendts has already made her final Burberry appearance. The group's trading statements (the next is due on 16 April) are usually presented by finance director Carol Fairweather, and full results don't come out until 21 May. Still, investors will be relaxed if Ahrendts is slipping quietly away as she gushes about \"the right time for me to exit stage left\" because she is handing over to \"one of this generation's greatest visionaries\". So presumably she'll be holding on to her \u00a310.5m of Burberry shares, then? Or maybe not. \"I can't communicate anything,\" blocks a spokeswoman. Old boys' club may lose long-serving members Are you a middle-aged gentleman, seeing out your City career in non-exec directorships, with no intention of disturbing this comfortable status quo? Well, be prepared to start defending your position. Last month Cranfield University, which provided the analysis underpinning Lord Davies's women on boards report, recommended five ways that FTSE 100 companies could hire the 48 women directors needed to hit the government's target of making boardrooms 25% female by next year. One plan was to oust some of the 82 male directors who are breaching UK corporate governance best practice by serving more than nine years in their roles, and to replace them with women. That might mean a couple of awkward questions this week for two of Cranfield's targets \u2013 miner Rio Tinto and cruise operator Carnival \u2013 which are both holding AGMs. Rio has Lord Kerr and Richard Goodmanson up for re-election, although their respective 10- and nine-year tenures make them look like rookies compared to those occupying the sun-loungers on the Carnival deck. It has four directors on Cranfield's radar, including Howard S Frank and Stuart Subotnick. Both have been in their positions for more than 20 years.",

I would say that there is not enough support from elected members for Lord Myners's ideas.\" The views of the independent societies are also important and Midcounties, the largest, waded into the debate last week by saying it would not back Myners. Its president, Patrick Gray, even suggested a break-up of the group as it stands, allowing the regions to spin off and go back under the control of local members. But as he resigned, Myners extracted a promise from board members that his proposals \u2013 to be published in full later this month \u2013 would be put to a vote at the annual meeting next month. Dame Pauline Green, president of the International Co-operative Alliance, argues that change is needed but that the right way has not yet been found. \"There is a general view in the co-op movement for change. But if by modernisation you mean a plc we are not in favour of that,\" she says. Find a chief executive The top job is currently being filled by a stand-in \u2013 Richard Pennycook, the finance director promoted to chief operating officer by Sutherland before he quit. Pennycook, known for a stint revamping Morrisons, has said he does not want the top job. There are suggestions that one of the bosses of the independent societies would be keen to fill the role, while others argue that if reforms give the chief executive a seat on the board, then the post could become attractive to a wide range of candidates. A full-time boss will be needed, though, who can provide stability, vision and unite the factions in the boardroom. No simple task.",

Despite some dire warnings about risky trading and the threat posed by overly indebted banks, the mood last week at the International Monetary Fund's spring conference was one of calm. We have turned a corner since the financial crisis, the Washington-based organisation says. Normality is returning. And this will mean establishing normal interest rates (up from 0.5% in the UK to 2%-3%, according to Mark Carney), restoring normal inflation and generating steady growth in the west of 2%-3%. Officials expect the US to lead the way. As consumer-in-chief, it will propel the world economy and global growth much as it has in the last 60 years. The dynamism of the US economy and its huge capacity to buy stuff will make life better for everyone, goes the rather tired argument. The legacies of the crash will be disposed of quietly. Having spent north of $3 trillion pumping funds into its economy and maintaining the cheapest borrowing costs in more than 100 years, the US central bank will find a way to sell this money back to the market, while at the same increasing rates, without much more than a ripple disturbing the markets. Central bankers in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and especially in the Federal Reserve will make sure it all works smoothly. Suddenly officials at the IMF are using the term \"finely calibrated\" in their discussions. No longer are governments involved in crude, large-scale pump-priming to rescue bankrupt banks. Today they execute technical exit strategies that magically restore the old order without any losses or panic. One official called this the \"Goldilocks exit\", by which he meant the transition would be one that involved the patient getting neither too hot nor too cold, but with a temperature that was just right. George Osborne revealed himself a cheerleader for the technocratic answer to debt and financial risk. The chancellor declared on Friday that central banks and regulators would make sure the west's economies had a bright future, as they withdrew the post-2008 stimulus and locked down risky lending. It would be a neat trick. And the betting must be that it will fail. It will fail because policymakers will be unable to cope with more fundamental forces at work. First there are the debts: government debts and household debts across the developed world. Put simply they are still too high. Bank debts in the eurozone and corporate debts in many emerging-market economies are similarly at risk from small financial shocks. The eurozone poses a particular problem. Spain is growing, but only with the help of government cash. Like Ireland, its banks are still in a parlous state. France is staggering on, but Italy is in permanent recession. Inflation is falling to the point that many worry it will go into reverse. Deflation means not only falling prices but also falling wages. The Germans have blocked initiatives that might boost output, especially in weaker countries, and are preventing the European Central Bank (ECB) from printing money to boost spending. ECB boss Mario Draghi may break free of German control, but any action will be too late. Casualties already lie everywhere. Another part of the problem is the legacy of savings generated in Asia. That savings glut has had to find a home, and one that provides a good return. There is about $70tn-$80tn invested in assets of various kinds from government bonds to property and exotic derivatives. The IMF highlighted how a $300bn market in US credit mutual funds in 2000 has grown to $2tn today. These funds are invested in junk bonds that are difficult to sell when the panic starts, making the panic even worse. Andy Haldane, soon to be chief economist at the Bank of England, told an audience of economists in Toronto last week that we were \"still in the intellectual foothills in terms of dealing with potential financial risks\". He pointed out that while there was some good news \u2013 for instance that banks in 2006 had borrowings worth 32 times their balance sheets and now \"only\" about 21 times \u2013 the problem had shifted to exotic derivatives, which accounted for $19tn of bank portfolios in 2006, but total $31tn today. Then there is the fact that 90% of trades in New York are generated by algorithm-driven computers, making the financial system prone to extreme volatility. Savings are generally seen as benign and the result of virtue and thrift, but they are dangerous when handed to investment managers under pressure to produce high returns. The IMF wants a financial system with airlocks that can contain panics, but knows there are instruments of contagion everywhere it looks. Its boss, Christine Lagarde, has warned of the threats, but without accusing those whose complacency she fears. It is time for some straight talking.",

      "bodyText": "The construction industry is sitting on a \"ticking timebomb\", with inexperienced workers being recruited to work on London's major building sites at a time when safety standards are being run down, according to a former government adviser on the sector. Baroness Donaghy, who wrote a landmark report, One Death Too Many, for the last Labour government, said there is a severe risk of a rise in deaths and serious injuries as building activity picks up during the recovery. Since 2001, 760 workers have died in industrial accidents on UK building sites. The number of site-related deaths in London, where growth in construction is strongest, has doubled recently. Donaghy said she was appalled by a 35% cut in the budget of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in 2011, after she had called in her March 2010 report for more funding to allow it to function properly as a regulator. The report was widely accepted by the Labour government, but has since been ignored by the coalition. Donaghy predicted that companies would cut corners and that accidents and deaths would increase. \"If there is an upturn, as is obviously happening in London, there is a danger that skills have been lost during the recession, and people who are insufficiently skilled will be taken on. And that's when the deaths and accidents will start taking place.\" She added: \"I do believe that if the recession is ending, the number of accidents will increase. Is it a ticking timebomb? Possibly right, yes. There is a real danger, without a well-resourced HSE, that corners will be cut.\" Only 10% of construction workers are trade union members and the industry has taken on increasing numbers of casual workers over the past two decades. A freedom of information request from the construction workers' union, Ucatt, showed a 7% fall in unannounced inspections of construction sites between 2011-12 and 2012-13, though the HSE said the number of inspections had risen in 2013-14 to make up for that dip. The FoI request also revealed a fall in improvement notices \u2013 which are HSE-issued orders to employers to address safety risks \u2013 from 1,021 in 2011-12 to just 800 the following year. And the number of employers being prosecuted for safety offences also fell, from 456 to 410. Steve Murphy, the general secretary of Ucatt, said: \"I sincerely believe the construction industry is chaotic. And deaths on sites will tragically rise in the next year.\" However Heather Bryant, chief inspector for construction at the HSE, said the organisation was adequately resourced, and that construction was one of its priority areas.",

      "bodyText": "The Francis Crick Institute, swiftly rising from a vast building site behind the British Library, next to London's St Pancras station, will be the biggest laboratory in Europe, a glittering \"jewel in the crown\" of UK medical research, according to ministers. Keen to share in the project's glory, on Radio Four's Today programme last week the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, even acknowledged that the Crick, as it has become known, is a key part of his plan for a \"MedCity\", something of a branding wheeze by Johnson to attract \"big-pharma\" investment to this part of north London and gain him kudos as a political visionary. The Crick is also where Richard Laco, 31, a labourer from Slovakia, was killed by falling concrete and steel on a cold Wednesday last November. The construction industry is the most dangerous sector in Britain. There is no trade like it. To put it in context, 448 British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001. Over the same period, more than 760 construction workers have been killed on British sites. It is an industry whose workers have from the year dot suffered from being treated as casual labour, picked up and dropped by companies according to the ebb and flow of the economic tide. Union involvement by workers has historically been a black mark against their names \u2013 sometimes literally in the case of the 3,300 workers condemned to work outside the industry through an industry-run blacklist, often for raising issues of health and safety. And beyond the headline fatalities on building sites \u2013 around 40 in 2013-14, the Health and Safety Executive is expected to report soon \u2013 last year there were 2,500 deaths due to asbestos exposure, 500 due to respirable crystalline silica exposure and 200 from diesel exhaust emissions. In the case of Laco, whose Facebook page advertises his love of hip-hop, the sitcom Frasier and playing basketball, he was killed when one of the building's concrete stairwells fell on him as it was being raised into position. He had been in and out of construction over the previous decade \u2013 Laing O'Rourke describe him as a qualified operative with 10 years' experience \u2013 picking up work when other career ventures failed. Laco's CV included a three-month trainee post at Amplify Trading in Canary Wharf, learning to be a trader in futures, as well as stints at the outdoor clothing and equipment store Ellis Brigham Mountain Sports. However, during the economic downturn he was not able to turn his fluency in four languages and a first-class degree in banking, finance and economics from Middlesex university into the career for which he yearned. So his last days were spent working for a Laing O'Rourke sub-contractor. Laco's death received little attention in the media. Although, like 90% of construction workers, he was not a member of a union, Unite organised a two-minute silence in his memory outside the site as workers on the upper floors of the Crick looked down. Laing O'Rourke said its staff had unanimously decided to pay their respects in a separate commemoration on the other side of security gates. A few weeks earlier, Unite officials who wanted to talk to some of the company's employees about redundancy negotiations had been told they were not welcome on the site. Unite officials had been banned, claimed assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail, \"and I can't help but think that death is more likely where unions are not welcome\". A spokesman for Laing O'Rourke said the company saw it differently. There is no union ban but, while complying with industry-wide guidelines concerning access for union officials, they will only go so far. \"Although union-appointed safety representatives may have an interest in the welfare of their members, we do not believe their involvement will add anything beyond our existing extensive approach, as they do not possess the technical understanding of our delivery approach to fully comprehend and be able to mitigate the safety risks on our projects,\" a spokesman said. Within a week of Laco's death, the Crick workers began to build again. Last month Rene Tkacik, a 43-year-old Slovakian, was 32ft below Holborn in a Crossrail tunnel when he was killed by falling concrete. Then there was Kevin Campbell, 46, killed at a Docklands Light Railway site after being struck by a piece of machinery attached to an excavator. And yet Laco, Campbell and Tkacik were working for the big companies or on public-sector sites \u2013 the safest jobs in the industry, for what that is worth. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which took a 35% cut to its funding in 2011, told the Observer that it now puts 70% of its diminished resources not into the Laing O'Rourkes of this world, but the small and medium-sized businesses. That's where the real risk-takers operate, they believe. Take the case of Silviu Radulescu, 31, who was killed just a week into his job as a labourer on a demolition job at a decommissioned prison service headquarters in south London. Radulescu, who had been working in a car handwash stall since arriving from Romania two years previously, wanted to emulate his younger brother, who was making good money on sites. He was killed in 2011 when he was asked to put aside his duties to help manually raise a broken lift. It fell five storeys when he was standing on its roof. In February this year, Westminster's coroner's court gave a verdict of unlawful death and the police are considering a charge of corporate manslaughter against his sometime employer TE Scudder (Demolition), according to Helen Clifford of solicitors Leigh Day, who represented the dead man's grieving family. Flavia Radulescu, his sister-in-law, who lives in St Albans, Hertfordshire, told the Observer that she wants lessons learned. \"Silviu wanted to work in construction but this job was as a labourer, just to get some experience,\" she said. \"It was my job to tell his parents back in Romania that he had been killed. I called them, but I just lied. I said he was in hospital, in a coma. For two weeks I couldn't tell them that he was dead \u2013 it was too hard. Silviu came here just to have a better life. He wanted to have a family and he would spend lots of time playing with my daughter. \"I was angry, so angry, at the time of his death. But now I just want them to learn, to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.\" The industry has been dragged kicking and screaming over the decades to change its practices and protect those desperate for work. The Latham report in 1994, commissioned by John Major's government, described industry practices as adversarial, ineffective, fragmented, incapable of delivering for its clients and lacking respect for its employees. Then the Egan report in 1998, commissioned by Tony Blair's government, sought to promote the training of staff down the supply chain and the dissemination of best practice. And in 2001 John Prescott, then the deputy prime minister, organised a summit where change was said to be imperative. And standards were raised; the numbers of fatalities did go down \u2013 incrementally. Lady Donaghy was the woman chosen by Gordon Brown's administration to usher in the next era of reform with a report, published in 2010, on what more could be done. She reported that the construction industry was designed for optimal flexibility, with 40% of workers self-employed, with the proportion more like 90% in London \u2013 often dependent on goodwill for their next shift. \"Some claimed that they were less likely to report unsafe practices because 'they wanted a job next Monday'; in other words, they were less secure in their employment,\" she wrote. Donaghy's report concluded there was little she could do about the casualisation of the industry. She wrote: \"The advantages are obvious in that it reduces overheads. Some, but not all, argue that it improves profitability and productivity. The disadvantages are that it becomes more difficult for a safety culture to flourish, worker engagement is weak, employment security and continuity is minimal and training is minimal.\" However, she made recommendations to ameliorate the dangers. Companies should name directors who are to be held responsible for health and safety, to ensure the courts can prosecute effectively, she said, at a time when smaller companies were simply going into voluntary liquidation following a fatality and emerging under another name. She also said there should be a full-time minister for construction who should encourage worker engagement with companies due to a lack of union presence on many sites. And the HSE should be properly funded. Donaghy's report, One Death Is Too Many, was welcomed by Brown's administration in March 2010, but then they lost power. None of the recommendations came to pass. It wasn't just the change of government, though, that put improvements on ice. The recession changed everything, too. The 39 deaths recorded by the HSE in construction for 2012-13 was a record low. But that may well be because between 2008 and 2009 the numbers working in construction were cut by a fifth and output by 17.1%. Problems that were intrinsic to the industry, causing the high rates of deaths and injuries in the mid-2000s, before the financial crash, have been left unsolved. \"Is it a ticking timebomb? Possibly, yes,\" Donaghy said. \"With the upturn there is a danger that people with insufficient skills will be taken on. That's when the deaths and accidents start to take place.\" The number of fatalities in the capital, where the clearest signs of growth in the industry can be seen, has doubled from four in 2011-12 to eight in 2012-13, and it is believed to have remained at around that number during the last year, if not higher. \"The green shoots are arriving in London and there are fewer experienced people on site and more pressure to finish jobs and get on with another one,\" Donaghy said. \"That's where a properly funded HSE is really important.\" And that's one of the worries of Steve Murphy, general secretary of the construction union Ucatt. In advance of Workers' Memorial Day on 28 April, he has publicised a freedom of information response from the HSE which shows that proactive inspections of sites went down from 11,334 in 2011-12 to 10,577 in 2012-13. The HSE claims that this was rectified in the last year, with 11,255 taking place. Murphy says this is not the step-up in activity that the new economic conditions demand. \"I believe there is chaos in the construction industry and deaths will rise,\" said Murphy. Heather Bryant, who was appointed chief inspector for construction at the HSE in 2013, lists a series of safety initiatives, but she also recognises the challenges. \"Historically, you would expect to see an increase in fatalities and injuries. But one of the things we have been trying to do is work closely with the industry and say: 'Watch out, be ahead of the game. This is what has happened historically, let's make sure it doesn't happen this time.'\"",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne is planning to make it easier to impose jail terms or heavy fines on British residents using offshore tax havens to cheat the exchequer out of billions in revenue. The chancellor, who is in Washington at the International Monetary Fund's spring meeting, has drafted a criminal offence of failing to declare offshore income as he steps up a long-running campaign to crack down on tax dodging. At present, HMRC has to prove a British resident has deliberately sent funds abroad to dodge tax. The need to prove intent has undermined several prosecutions and allowed those under investigation to escape with only light fines, Treasury officials said. HMRC estimates \u00a35bn a year is lost to the exchequer from tax evasion by wealthy individuals, out of a \u00a335bn overall loss to evasion and non-payment. \"It is totally unacceptable for people not to pay tax that is due in the UK,\" Osborne said between meetings at the IMF spring conference. \"The vast majority of wealthy people pay their taxes and their share of tax income has been going up. HMRC believes it has been difficult getting the outright tax evader.\" The UK government is working with 50 other countries in a pilot project to share information about potential tax avoiders. The project is co-ordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has laid out rules for information sharing between governments on potential tax dodgers. Osborne said previous governments had failed to put rigorous rules in place. \"It has been a problem in the British crown dependencies, which have not done enough in the past to be transparent. But we have been tough and as a result they have fallen into line.\" While much of the discussion of tax havens has focused on the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, ministers believe a larger proportion of untaxed cash is in Lichtenstein, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In a document available for consultation from Monday, the Treasury says: \"Our published criminal investigation policy will still apply, meaning criminal investigation will be pursued where there is a need to send a strong deterrent message or where conduct is serious enough that only a criminal sanction is appropriate. \"We have committed to increase the number of investigations fivefold. This will result in over 1,000 additional prosecutions for tax evasion by the end of the 2014-15 financial year.\" In 2010-11, HMRC secured only 165 prosecutions, compared with a projected haul of 1,174 next year. The government has a chequered history in its pursuit of tax avoidance and evasion. Osborne said \u00a31.5bn in extra tax was recovered in the last two years after HMRC stepped up the number of investigations. But last year HMRC came under fire after it recovered less than \u00a3800m following a deal with Switzerland that was expected to reap \u00a33.1bn in extra tax. Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, criticised the original estimate as \"completely unrealistic\". HMRC's tax assurance commissioner, Ed Troup, blamed the constraints of Swiss bank secrecy even though the deal was billed as overcoming previous restrictions on disclosure by Swiss bank account holders.",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne is planning to make it easier to impose jail terms or heavy fines on British residents using offshore tax havens to cheat the exchequer out of billions in revenue.</p> <p>The chancellor, who is in Washington at the International Monetary Fund's spring meeting, has drafted a criminal offence of failing to declare offshore income as he steps up a long-running campaign to crack down on tax dodging.</p> <p>At present, HMRC has to prove a British resident has deliberately sent funds abroad to dodge tax. The need to prove intent has undermined several prosecutions and allowed those under investigation to escape with only light fines, Treasury officials said.</p> <p>HMRC estimates \u00a35bn a year is lost to the exchequer from tax evasion by wealthy individuals, out of a \u00a335bn overall loss to evasion and non-payment.</p> <p>\"It is totally unacceptable for people not to pay tax that is due in the UK,\" Osborne said between meetings at the IMF spring conference. \"The vast majority of wealthy people pay their taxes and their share of tax income has been going up. HMRC believes it has been difficult getting the outright tax evader.\"</p> <p>The UK government is working with 50 other countries in a pilot project to share information about potential tax avoiders. The project is co-ordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has laid out rules for information sharing between governments on potential tax dodgers.</p> <p>Osborne said previous governments had failed to put rigorous rules in place. \"It has been a problem in the British crown dependencies, which have not done enough in the past to be transparent. But we have been tough and as a result they have fallen into line.\"</p> <p>While much of the discussion of tax havens has focused on the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, ministers believe a larger proportion of untaxed cash is in Lichtenstein, Luxembourg and&#xa0;Switzerland.</p> <p>In a document available for consultation from Monday, the Treasury says: \"Our published criminal investigation policy will still apply, meaning criminal investigation will be pursued where there is a need to send a strong deterrent message or where conduct is serious enough that only a criminal sanction is appropriate.</p> <p>\"We have committed to increase the number of investigations fivefold. This will result in over 1,000 additional prosecutions for tax evasion by the end of the 2014-15 financial year.\"</p> <p>In 2010-11, HMRC secured only 165 prosecutions, compared with a projected haul of 1,174 next year.</p> <p>The government has a chequered history in its pursuit of tax avoidance and evasion. Osborne said \u00a31.5bn in extra tax was recovered in the last two years after HMRC stepped up the number of investigations. But last year HMRC came under fire after it recovered less than \u00a3800m following a deal with Switzerland that was expected to reap \u00a33.1bn in extra tax.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, criticised the original estimate as \"completely unrealistic\".</p> <p>HMRC's tax assurance commissioner, Ed Troup, blamed the constraints of Swiss bank secrecy even though the deal was billed as overcoming previous restrictions on disclosure by Swiss bank account holders.</p>",
