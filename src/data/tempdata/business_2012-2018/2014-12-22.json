      "bodyText": "For a man with the unlikely description of \u201crock-star economist\u201d, there is nothing rock\u2019n\u2019roll about Thomas Piketty\u2019s cramped, book-lined office in a nondescript Parisian office block. By his feet are scattered various foreign translations of his publishing sensation, Capital in the Twenty-First Century: Greek, German, Japanese, and so on. There are 20 foreign editions already published, he tells me with evident pride, and another 37 to come. It must be rather surreal, I suggest: one doesn\u2019t normally expect a French economist to become a global superstar. \u201cIs there something particular with being French, or economists in general?\u201d he jokes in a thick Parisian accent, effecting a faux wounded Gallic pride. Piketty\u2019s book is surely the most influential published by an economist in a generation, infuriating the right as much as it delighted an intellectually starved left. Using a mass of data, the book sought to expose why modern capitalism is an engine of exploding inequality: the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate at which the economy grows, he argues, and wealth is becoming ever more concentrated at the top of society. More explosively, he proposes a global wealth tax as a check on this process, even though he has conceded this is \u201cutopian\u201d. He has been feted by political leaders across the western world \u2013 Ed Miliband among them \u2013 and beyond. I ask the boyish 43-year-old if his life has been thrown upside down. \u201cNot so much. Sure, it was much more successful than I could expect \u2013 it was a gradual process, I had time to get accustomed ... it\u2019s not like a huge shock from complete anonymity to complete stardom. I\u2019m still a little star!\u201d Piketty has been engaged in his research for 15 years. At the height of the global financial crisis in 2009, newly elected US president Barack Obama used the graphs of the economist and his team, upsetting Republican thinktanks, which complained that \u201cthese French economists were influencing the politics in the US\u201d. Still, it is quite an ascent for a man from relatively humble origins in a north Paris suburb. His mother, from a strongly working-class background, became a primary school teacher; his father, a technician at a research institute, was from a rich \u201cbourgeois\u201d family, \u201cbut decided to leave his family, in many ways\u201d. Both were fleetingly involved in French Trotskyist group Lutte Ouvri\u00e8re, but \u201cthey left very quickly because in Lutte Ouvri\u00e8re you can\u2019t really have a life\u201d. It is a source of deep satisfaction that his mother completed reading his book, and proof for him that he has achieved the accessibility he clearly craves. \u201cShe never reads big academic books, but she read it, and I think she understood everything ... I think it shows that it\u2019s not true that issues of income and wealth and inequality and capital are too complicated. I think economists try to pretend it\u2019s too complicated, and use very complicated mathematical models just to look scientific and try to impress other people.\u201d Piketty\u2019s 696-page book may be a bestseller, but are many people reading all of it? This is a sensitive question to put to any author, but I refer to analysis in the Wall Street Journal that \u2013 based on the fact that the five most highlighted passages on the book\u2019s Kindle version are in the first 26 pages \u2013 an average of 2.4% of the book has been read. \u201cIt was a stupid statistic,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the people who have done that, they should read more books. I think it\u2019s useful to read books, rather than doing this stupid statistic \u2013 this is really ridiculous. All that says is the introduction of my book is very good so people like it a lot and so they scribbled a lot on the introduction, but it doesn\u2019t say anything about the fact that people have read it ... I think it\u2019s really a readable book, it takes time to read, but I think it\u2019s useful to read books \u2013 there\u2019s nothing I can do for people who don\u2019t read books, that\u2019s beyond my power.\u201d The book came under ferocious fire from Financial Times journalist Chris Giles (although that critique was itself strongly criticised), who accused Piketty of errors. Did it ever make him nervous? \u201cNot really, everything is online, everything has been online for ever, and I\u2019m very happy they checked it,\u201d he says, carefully sticking to a diplomatic line he has maintained since Giles\u2019s opening salvo. But he can\u2019t resist mocking the FT\u2019s mixed messages. \u201cPeople at the FT seem to be very confused. First, they say it\u2019s full of mistakes and then they give me the best book of the year ... I responded to every point online. I think everyone who has looked at this has concluded that they made a lot of noise out of nothing at all. If it was full of mistakes, why did they give me their best book of the year?\u201d Piketty joined the elite \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris in September 1989, soon after which two big events had a profound impact on his political development. The Berlin Wall fell, leading him to travel to Romania and across eastern Europe. \u201cI was born too late to have any temptation with communism, or at least Soviet-type communism,\u201d he explains. \u201cTravelling in eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union, you clearly don\u2019t want to defend a system that would have empty shops and a totalitarian regime and internal passports.\u201d The end of the cold war, for him, had two key intellectual consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for my generation to reopen the issue of inequality dynamics under capitalism, because I take for granted that private property is part of the solution,\u201d he suggests. But although he believes the fall of Stalinism was \u201cvery positive\u201d, it resulted in \u201cvery big power to capital, and a sort of faith in property rights, and the idea that free-market competition is going to get us to the ideal world, that there\u2019s no need for redistribution, there\u2019s no need for public regulation\u201d. In other words, Piketty is part of an intellectual backlash to the rampant free-market triumphalism that was unleashed after the fall of the Soviet bloc. The other influence is perhaps more surprising: the first Gulf war that followed Ba\u2019athist Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which shocked him and his colleagues at the \u00e9cole. \u201cIt was a very strong event, because sometimes we say that governments cannot do much against tax havens, they\u2019re too powerful. And suddenly we\u2019re able to send 1 million troops 1,000km away from home to give back the oil to the emir of Kuwait. I was not sure this was the right redistribution of wealth.\u201d The west\u2019s general relationship with the Middle East \u2013 \u201cthe most unequal region in the world\u201d, he says \u2013 is one that troubles him, not least because it exposes grotesque inequalities. \u201cTake Egypt: the total budget for education for 100 million people is 100 times less than the oil revenue for a few dozen people in Qatar. And then in London and in Paris we are happy to have these people buying football clubs and buying apartments, and then we are surprised that the youths in the Middle East don\u2019t take very seriously our democracy and social justice.\u201d Although some on the right have assailed him as a dangerous red, I put it to him that he is not as radical as he is portrayed. He has written that he was \u201cvaccinated for life against the conventional but lazy rhetoric of anti-capitalism\u201d; he opposed the introduction of a 35-hour week in France, and the Wall Street Journal even called him \u201ca neoliberal economist who sees many virtues in market forces but favours government redistribution to smooth out some of the market\u2019s excesses.\u201d He looks bemused. \u201cI don\u2019t live in the cold war. Some people maybe still live in the cold war, but this is their problem, not mine.\u201d He unashamedly believes in \u201cmarket forces\u201d, arguing there is no \u201cwar of religion\u201d between left and right in the modern era. But he defends his radicalism, arguing that a global wealth tax makes \u201cproperty temporary, rather than permanent\u201d, which he describes as \u201ca permanent revolution, a very substantial change to the traditional capitalist system\u201d. Though Piketty supported Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s presidential bid in 2012, he is contemptuous of the French president. \u201cHe\u2019s been a disaster,\u201d is his unequivocal response, clarifying that he was \u201cmore against Sarkozy than [he] was for Hollande\u201d. He assails the likes of France and Germany for their \u201cselfish\u201d attitude to austerity-ravaged southern Europe, and calls for the creation of a eurozone parliament based on majority decision-making \u2013 abolishing any veto \u2013 as the way forward. That would put a stop to beggar-thy-neighbour-type policies by countries such as Luxembourg that try to \u201csteal the tax base of their neighbours\u201d. That said, he rebukes what he describes as \u201cthe new extreme left movements\u201d in Europe, specifically Podemos in Spain and Syriza in Greece. Culture looms large among influences. The 19th-century French author Honor\u00e9 de Balzac is among them. Piketty speaks of Vautrin, a \u201cvery cynical character\u201d in one of Balzac\u2019s novels, who asks an ambitious Parisian law student named Rastignac whether \u201che can get rich just by being a good student or whether he should marry someone with high wealth\u201d. Another book that impressed him was Destiny and Desire, by the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes, which was full of insights into the \u201ctransmission of wealth in Mexico\u201d. Both fed Piketty\u2019s passionate interest in the \u201crelative importance of wealth and labour in life\u201d. He goes to the cinema up to four times a week, and his favourite movie of the year was Snowpiercer, a dystopian Korean film about a world destroyed by a botched attempt to curb global warming that leaves the remnants of humanity trapped on a train with the poor consigned to the very back, the very rich at the front. There is an uncomfortable topic that I have to raise. Earlier this year, allegations surfaced that Piketty had perpetrated domestic violence against his former partner, who made a legal complaint in 2009. Piketty has spoken out before to confirm he was arrested but that no charges or prosecution followed. His response, however, at this interview, is perturbing. When I ask about the allegations, he clams up and begins to mumble. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen that, you\u2019re the first person to tell me about it.\u201d It has been in several newspapers, I say (he denied doing anything wrong at the time). \u201cI\u2019ve not seen it.\u201d The claims are just all nonsense, then? \u201cI have not seen it. I am sorry. You probably don\u2019t read the same papers as I do!\u201d A nervous laugh follows. I move on, although the atmosphere has gone rather stale. Does he find his rock-star intellectual reputation demeaning or has he embraced it? \u201cWell, if it gets more people to read my book, then I have no problem with the publicity,\u201d is the curt reply. His aim is to allow people to make up their own minds. Explaining his success, he argues that \u201cwhat I\u2019m really contributing to in this book is a democratisation of economic knowledge\u201d. His aim is not to \u201chave breakfast or lunch with politicians\u201d \u2013 though he does out of politeness, he says, with Ed Miliband or Chile\u2019s president, Michelle Bachelet \u2013 but to try to win over public opinion, which he thinks is a more effective means of pressuring the political elite. His book has already prompted governments to release more of their fiscal files to help further studies into the distribution of wealth. Piketty fears the far right, including the surging National Front in France, which he describes as \u201cvery frightening\u201d. \u201cI am afraid that if you don\u2019t find peaceful domestic solutions to our inequality and social problems, then it\u2019s always tempting to find other people responsible for our problems.\u201d The social contract is threatened by middle-class and poor people resenting paying more tax than multinational companies, which sometimes pay nothing. But he has optimism, too. He believes public opinion in Europe remains \u201cstrongly attached to certain forms of social models\u201d. The continent remains more egalitarian than the US, and politics not quite as hijacked by Big Money. But for Piketty, revolution is not the solution. \u201cI think one problem in the past is that people put more energy into thinking about the day of the revolution itself than what they\u2019d do in power,\u201d he says. More historical shocks \u2013 like war and revolution \u2013 will undoubtedly come, he believes. \u201cBut at the same time, if I have chosen to write books rather than to be a guerrilla or something like that, it\u2019s because I believe democratic discussion and drawing from history can get us to do better next time. A peaceful solution.\u201d",

I\u2019m still a little star!\u201d</p> <p>Piketty has been engaged in his research for 15 years. At the height of the global financial crisis in 2009, newly elected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/27/thomas-piketty-economist-american-dream\" title=\"\">US president Barack Obama used the graphs of the economist and his team</a>, upsetting Republican thinktanks, which complained that \u201cthese French economists were influencing the politics in the US\u201d.</p> <p>Still, it is quite an ascent for a man from relatively humble origins in a north Paris suburb. His mother, from a strongly working-class background, became a primary school teacher; his father, a technician at a research institute, was from a rich \u201cbourgeois\u201d family, \u201cbut decided to leave his family, in many ways\u201d. Both were fleetingly involved in French Trotskyist group Lutte Ouvri\u00e8re, but \u201cthey left very quickly because in Lutte Ouvri\u00e8re you can\u2019t really have a life\u201d.</p> <p>It is a source of deep satisfaction that his mother completed reading his book, and proof for him that he has achieved the accessibility he clearly craves. \u201cShe never reads big academic books, but she read it, and I think she understood everything ... I think it shows that it\u2019s not true that issues of income and wealth and inequality and capital are too complicated. I think economists try to pretend it\u2019s too complicated, and use very complicated mathematical models just to look scientific and try to impress other people.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c11959c0db4b1add0c3716ae69343bd63b9c23df\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/19/1419010494691/b6b526c2-6ce5-45f4-b255-753fd3a5bf69-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Capital in the Twenty First\" width=\"265\" height=\"416\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Piketty\u2019s bestseller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/sep/21/-sp-thomas-piketty-bestseller-why\" title=\"\">Piketty\u2019s 696-page book may be a bestseller</a>, but are many people reading all of it? This is a sensitive question to put to any author, but I refer to analysis in the Wall Street Journal that \u2013 based on the fact that the five most highlighted passages on the book\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/dec/20/kindle-amazon-ebooks-hunger-games\" title=\"\">Kindle</a> version are in the first 26 pages \u2013 an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2014/jul/07/hawking-index-give-up-on-books-capital-fifty-shades\" title=\"\">average of 2.4% of the book has been read</a>. \u201cIt was a stupid statistic,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the people who have done that, they should read more books. I think it\u2019s useful to read books, rather than doing this stupid statistic \u2013 this is really ridiculous. All that says is the introduction of my book is very good so people like it a lot and so they scribbled a lot on the introduction, but it doesn\u2019t say anything about the fact that people have read it ... I think it\u2019s really a readable book, it takes time to read, but I think it\u2019s useful to read books \u2013 there\u2019s nothing I can do for people who don\u2019t read books, that\u2019s beyond my power.\u201d</p> <p>The book came under ferocious fire from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/may/29/ft-journalist-errors-thomas-piketty-takedown\" title=\"\">Financial Times journalist Chris Giles (although that critique was itself strongly criticised)</a>, who accused Piketty of errors. Did it ever make him nervous? \u201cNot really, everything is online, everything has been online for ever, and I\u2019m very happy they checked it,\u201d he says, carefully sticking to a diplomatic line he has maintained since Giles\u2019s opening salvo. But he can\u2019t resist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/may/29/piketty-chris-giles-and-wealth-inequality-its-all-about-the-discontinuities\" title=\"\">mocking the FT\u2019s mixed messages</a>. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/26/thomas-piketty-financial-times-dishonest-criticism-economics-book-inequality\" title=\"\">People at the FT seem to be very confused</a>. First, they say it\u2019s full of mistakes and then they give me the best book of the year ... I responded to every point online. I think everyone who has looked at this has concluded that they made a lot of noise out of nothing at all. If it was full of mistakes, why did they give me their best book of the year?\u201d</p> <p>Piketty joined the elite \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris in September 1989, soon after which two big events had a profound impact on his political development. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/06/-sp-fall-berlin-wall-what-it-meant-to-be-there\" title=\"\">Berlin Wall fell</a>, leading him to travel to Romania and across eastern Europe. \u201cI was born too late to have any temptation with communism, or at least Soviet-type communism,\u201d he explains. \u201cTravelling in eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union, you clearly don\u2019t want to defend a system that would have empty shops and a totalitarian regime and internal passports.\u201d The end of the cold war, for him, had two key intellectual consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for my generation to reopen the issue of inequality dynamics under capitalism, because I take for granted that private property is part of the solution,\u201d he suggests. But although he believes the fall of Stalinism was \u201cvery positive\u201d, it resulted in \u201cvery big power to capital, and a sort of faith in property rights, and the idea that free-market competition is going to get us to the ideal world, that there\u2019s no need for redistribution, there\u2019s no need for public regulation\u201d. In other words, Piketty is part of an intellectual backlash to the rampant free-market triumphalism that was unleashed after the fall of the Soviet bloc.</p> <p>The other influence is perhaps more surprising: the first Gulf war that followed Ba\u2019athist Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which shocked him and his colleagues at the \u00e9cole. \u201cIt was a very strong event, because sometimes we say that governments cannot do much against tax havens, they\u2019re too powerful. And suddenly we\u2019re able to send 1 million troops 1,000km away from home to give back the oil to the emir of Kuwait. I was not sure this was the right redistribution of wealth.\u201d</p> <p>The west\u2019s general relationship with the Middle East \u2013 \u201cthe most unequal region in the world\u201d, he says \u2013 is one that troubles him, not least because it exposes grotesque inequalities. \u201cTake Egypt: the total budget for education for 100 million people is 100 times less than the oil revenue for a few dozen people in Qatar. And then in London and in Paris we are happy to have these people buying football clubs and buying apartments, and then we are surprised that the youths in the Middle East don\u2019t take very seriously our democracy and social justice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7870cddf-f61f-49de-8600-2533fbbb670d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/19/1419010733239/3d4e3f6b-0a7d-4623-b6d6-606bc03c5c9f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomas Piketty\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not as radical as he is portrayed? Thomas Piketty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although some on the right have assailed him as a dangerous red, I put it to him that he is not as radical as he is portrayed. He has written that he was \u201cvaccinated for life against the conventional but lazy rhetoric of anti-capitalism\u201d; he opposed the introduction of a 35-hour week in France, and the Wall Street Journal even called him \u201ca neoliberal economist who sees many virtues in market forces but favours government redistribution to smooth out some of the market\u2019s excesses.\u201d He looks bemused. \u201cI don\u2019t live in the cold war. Some people maybe still live in the cold war, but this is their problem, not mine.\u201d He unashamedly believes in \u201cmarket forces\u201d, arguing there is no \u201cwar of religion\u201d between left and right in the modern era. But he defends his radicalism, arguing that a global wealth tax makes \u201cproperty temporary, rather than permanent\u201d, which he describes as \u201ca permanent revolution, a very substantial change to the traditional capitalist system\u201d.</p> <p>Though <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-05-29/pikettys-capital-economists-inequality-ideas-are-all-the-rage\" title=\"\">Piketty supported Fran\u00e7ois Hollande</a>\u2019s presidential bid in 2012, he is contemptuous of the French president. \u201cHe\u2019s been a disaster,\u201d is his unequivocal response, clarifying that he was \u201cmore against Sarkozy than [he] was for Hollande\u201d. He assails the likes of France and Germany for their \u201cselfish\u201d attitude to austerity-ravaged southern Europe, and calls for the creation of a eurozone parliament based on majority decision-making \u2013 abolishing any veto \u2013 as the way forward. That would put a stop to beggar-thy-neighbour-type policies by countries such as Luxembourg that try to \u201csteal the tax base of their neighbours\u201d. That said, he rebukes what he describes as \u201cthe new extreme left movements\u201d in Europe, specifically <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/16/podemos-left-crisis-ukip-anti-immigrant\" title=\"\">Podemos in Spain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/03/syriza-future-greece-europe-radical-left\" title=\"\">Syriza in Greece</a>.</p> <p>Culture looms large among influences. The 19th-century French author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/25/human-comedy-balzac-review-nicholas-lezard\" title=\"\">Honor\u00e9 de Balzac</a> is among them. Piketty speaks of Vautrin, a \u201cvery cynical character\u201d in one of Balzac\u2019s novels, who asks an ambitious Parisian law student named Rastignac whether \u201che can get rich just by being a good student or whether he should marry someone with high wealth\u201d. Another book that impressed him was Destiny and Desire, by the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes, which was full of insights into the \u201ctransmission of wealth in Mexico\u201d. Both fed Piketty\u2019s passionate interest in the \u201crelative importance of wealth and labour in life\u201d. He goes to the cinema up to four times a week, and his favourite movie of the year was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/snowpiercer\" title=\"\">Snowpiercer</a>, a dystopian Korean film about a world destroyed by a botched attempt to curb global warming that leaves the remnants of humanity trapped on a train with the poor consigned to the very back, the very rich at the front.</p> <p>There is an uncomfortable topic that I have to raise. Earlier this year, allegations surfaced that Piketty had perpetrated domestic violence against his former partner, who made a legal complaint in 2009. Piketty has spoken out before to confirm he was arrested but that no charges or prosecution followed. His response, however, at this interview, is perturbing. When I ask about the allegations, he clams up and begins to mumble. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen that, you\u2019re the first person to tell me about it.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10807714/Frances-rock-star-economist-Thomas-Piketty-beat-former-lover.html\" title=\"\">It has been in several newspapers, I say</a> (he denied doing anything wrong at the time). \u201cI\u2019ve not seen it.\u201d The claims are just all nonsense, then? \u201cI have not seen it. I am sorry. You probably don\u2019t read the same papers as I do!\u201d A nervous laugh follows.</p> <p>I move on, although the atmosphere has gone rather stale. Does he find his rock-star intellectual reputation demeaning or has he embraced it? \u201cWell, if it gets more people to read my book, then I have no problem with the publicity,\u201d is the curt reply. His aim is to allow people to make up their own minds. Explaining his success, he argues that \u201cwhat I\u2019m really contributing to in this book is a democratisation of economic knowledge\u201d. His aim is not to \u201chave breakfast or lunch with politicians\u201d \u2013 though he does out of politeness, he says, with Ed Miliband or Chile\u2019s president, Michelle Bachelet \u2013 but to try to win over public opinion, which he thinks is a more effective means of pressuring the political elite. His book has already prompted governments to release more of their fiscal files to help further studies into the distribution of wealth.</p> <p>Piketty fears the far right, including the surging National Front in France, which he describes as \u201cvery frightening\u201d. \u201cI am afraid that if you don\u2019t find peaceful domestic solutions to our inequality and social problems, then it\u2019s always tempting to find other people responsible for our problems.\u201d The social contract is threatened by middle-class and poor people resenting paying more tax than multinational companies, which sometimes pay nothing. But he has optimism, too. He believes public opinion in Europe remains \u201cstrongly attached to certain forms of social models\u201d. The continent remains more egalitarian than the US, and politics not quite as hijacked by Big Money.</p> <p>But for Piketty, revolution is not the solution. \u201cI think one problem in the past is that people put more energy into thinking about the day of the revolution itself than what they\u2019d do in power,\u201d he says. More historical shocks \u2013 like war and revolution \u2013 will undoubtedly come, he believes. \u201cBut at the same time, if I have chosen to write books rather than to be a guerrilla or something like that, it\u2019s because I believe democratic discussion and drawing from history can get us to do better next time. A peaceful solution.\u201d</p>",

As ships and cargo capacity have continued to grow, workers say suitable equipment and logistical provisions have not been provided for \u2013 a view broadly backed by industry analysts. Despite an on-the-job fatality rate higher than that of firefighters and policemen \u2013 with recent casualties including a woman crushed to death by a container and a man run over by a top-loader \u2013 the longshore trade remains a popular one. Openings are rare and highly sought after. In 2012, when entry-level positions were made available in San Diego, 12,600 people applied for just 40 positions, according to the San Diego Port Authority. The pay is promising in the long run, with \u201cclass A\u201d workers earning over $100,000 a year and health benefits of the highest quality. But that of course is contingent on accruing the necessary hours and seniority. Base pay is $25 to $35 per hour and is always done by the shift, with junior or \u201ccasual\u201d workers \u2013 almost one-third of all ILWU members \u2013 rarely getting full-time hours. Discussions between the two parties, details of which have mostly been closed to the media, are ongoing. The french fries setback has led McDonald\u2019s to take emergency steps, including exporting 1,000 tons of the food from the US by air. This sort of action is rare: the US almost strictly moves its overseas cargo volume by boat. McDonald\u2019s will be limiting the size of its french fry portions in Japan for the foreseeable future. Back at home, the dispute is providing a fascinating look into a potential future for an otherwise waning labor movement. \u201cThe larger story here is about Walmart and Target, about their dominant economic positions and their ... reliance on export and import,\u201d says Brishen Rogers, an associate professor of law at Temple University. \u201cJust imagine what would happen if longshoremen suddenly refused to unload Walmart goods. That\u2019s the $50bn question.\u201d",

The small village, which lies in a maple tree-covered snowscape off the main highway between Montreal and Quebec City, is home to the world\u2019s biggest reserve of its kind \u2013 for maple syrup. An 8ft-high fence and security system surrounds the reserve. Visitors must tap in a code to gain access. \u201cWe have exterior cameras,\u201d says Cyr, pointing to the building\u2019s extensive CCTV system. She is the spokeswoman for the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers Federation. For Cyr, maple syrup is \u201creally emotional\u201d: she has worked alongside her father and grandfather making the sweetener. \u201cWe are filming everything, night and day,\u201d she says proudly. The producers \u2013 responsible for nearly 75% of the world\u2019s supply of maple syrup \u2013 keep a vast back-up in a 235,000 sq ft warehouse. The reserve was established more than a decade ago to ensure the syrup, which is harvested in mid-winter, is available all year round. The warehouse, known as la forteresse du sirop d\u2019\u00e9rable \u2013 or the maple syrup fortress \u2013 has bank-like security features. Inside, 18m kg of syrup are stored in 63,000 white barrels stacked five high in dozens of rows. The warehouse, which is alarmed, would not be out of place in a James Bond film. At its peak, the reserve, which includes two satellite buildings, can hold up to 33m kg of the elixir. Canadians take their famous syrup for granted. Traditionally used to drench pancakes and waffles, it is also in great demand for other uses \u2013 to make salad vinaigrettes, as a seasoning for barbecue meats and in deserts and cocktails. But at $1,800 (\u00a31,000) Canadian dollars a barrel \u2013 30 times the price of crude oil \u2013 it is extremely valuable. It takes 18kg of maple tree sap to make just half a kilo of syrup and within the industry it is known as liquid gold. Maple syrup contributes $750m to the Quebec economy and supports thousands of jobs. Exports to the US, Europe and Japan have increased by 20% in the past decade. Industry officials are excited about plans to take it to new markets such as India. Kevin Gauthier, monitoring the images from the cameras on his computer screen, is the reserve\u2019s manager. He is the first to be called if the alarm goes off at 4am and takes his job very seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful product. We have to look after it,\u201d he says. The fortress-like security measures are a response to one of the biggest thefts in Canadian history. From 2011-12, the federation rented a facility with minimal security and a gang of criminals used the opportunity to carry out an audacious heist. Over the course of a year, they removed $18m of maple syrup from 6,000 barrels. The theft was discovered during a routine inspection \u2013 detection was not immediate because the barrels had been refilled with water. Federation officials were left embarrassed. Simon Tr\u00e9panier, then a senior executive with the federation and now executive director, remains astounded by the attack. \u201cTalk about jewellery, cars, money \u2013 but maple syrup?\u201d He describes the thieves as brilliant \u2013 but with reservations. \u201cObviously, it was a big job. But they weren\u2019t brilliant enough to not get caught.\u201d Quebec police arrested nearly 30 people who face charges of conspiracy, theft and intent to sell stolen goods. About 70% of the stolen syrup was eventually recovered from across Canada, though some of it is believed to have found its way to the US. The federation learned a costly lesson: maple syrup could no longer be taken for granted. The Laurierville warehouse was bought and refurbished at a cost of $4m \u2013 with tightened security. North of Montreal, Normand Urbain, a fourth-generation maple syrup producer, is busy checking some of the taps of his 7,000 maple trees before the forthcoming harvest. Like many producers, he was stunned by the heist and still smarts at the ridiculing the industry received from comedians in the US. But the new reserve, he says, has helped restore his faith in the federation\u2019s ability to protect his product. Urbain, a commerce graduate, believes the reserve has a strategic role to play if maple syrup is to go global. \u201cIf you go into India, and maybe even China some day, our clients want to be able to have syrup all year round.\u201d In the meantime, he is concerned that Hollywood plans for a comedy about the heist could damage the maple syrup industry\u2019s image. \u201cWhile it\u2019s nice to have a good laugh, at some point it gets too much.\u201d",

In the latest blow to the ailing retail group, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said it would examine the role of PwC as well as the behaviour of individuals at the auditor and at Tesco in relation to the preparation, approval and audit of accounts going back to February 2012. PwC, which remains Tesco\u2019s auditor, and individual chartered accountants working for the supermarket could potentially face unlimited fines, legal costs and exclusion from the profession if the watchdog finds evidence of misconduct that it can prove at tribunal. The accountancy firm said: \u201cWe take our responsibilities very seriously and remain committed to delivering work to the highest professional standards. We will co-operate fully with the FRC in its inquiries.\u201d Tesco said it would provide support to the FRC\u2019s investigation. The latest probe follows an investigation launched by the Serious Fraud Office in October which the FRC said it was closely monitoring. Just weeks after the early arrival of Tesco\u2019s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, who was parachuted in at the beginning of September as the group battled falling sales and profits, a team of forensic accountants from Deloitte established that the estimate of first-half profits that Tesco gave the City in August was artificially inflated by \u00a3263m. Deloitte said \u00a3118m of the figure related to the first six months of the current financial year and \u00a3145m related to previous years. The inquiry triggered the suspension of nine senior executives, including Chris Bush, the head of the UK food business. Four of the executives have since left the business. Some analysts have suggested executives pulled forward payments from suppliers to paint a more flattering picture of the finances of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer as it struggled to meet profit targets. Lewis has dismissed the suggestion that fraud was involved: \u201cNobody gained financially as a consequence of the overstatement of performance.\u201d But the investigations come at a difficult time for Tesco as Lewis is attempting to turn around performance in the UK and manage ailing businesses overseas. Earlier this month, Tesco\u2019s shares slumped to a 14-year low as Lewis admitted the cost of cleaning up dealings with suppliers and bringing in extra shop-floor staff to improve service would slash \u00a3500m from annual profits. The City is braced for potential further profit falls when Lewis updates the City on his plans on 8 January after what is expected to be another tough Christmas. The grocer faces heavy competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl while it is locked in a bitter price war with major rivals including Asda and Morrisons.",

On the day that Russia\u2019s central bank threw a $530m (\u00a3340m) lifeline to Moscow\u2019s Trust Bank, the IMF said its generally upbeat assessment of the impact of falling oil prices on the global economy could be upset by investors taking fright at what is happening to Vladimir Putin\u2019s energy-rich country. Alexei Kudrin, Russia\u2019s former finance minister, said 2015 would be a tough year for the economy as he blamed the Kremlin for failing to act quickly enough and said the country\u2019s debt would be downgraded to \u201cjunk\u201d status. \u201cToday, I can say that we have entered or are entering a real, full-fledged economic crisis. Next year, we will feel it clearly,\u201d Kudrin said. Predicting a wave of corporate failures and state bailouts of the banks, he added: \u201cThe government has not been quick enough to address the situation \u2026 I am yet to hear \u2026 its clear assessment of the current situation.\u201d Olivier Blanchard, the fund\u2019s chief economist, and Rabah Arezki, head of its commodities research team, said: \u201cOil prices have plunged recently, affecting everyone: producers, exporters, governments, and consumers. Overall, we see this as a shot in the arm for the global economy. Bearing in mind that our simulations do not represent a forecast of the state of the global economy, we find a gain for world GDP between 0.3% and 0.7% in 2015, compared to a scenario without the drop in oil prices.\u201d But they said their optimistic analysis came with a warning. \u201cOne of the lessons from the Great Financial Crisis is that large changes in prices and exchange rates, and the implied increased uncertainty about the position of some firms and some countries, can lead to increases in global risk aversion, with major implications for repricing of risk and for shifts in capital flows. This is all the more true when combined with other developments such as what is happening in Russia. One cannot completely dismiss this tail risk.\u201d Trust, which uses the Hollywood star Bruce Willis to advertise its credit cards, ran into trouble after its policy of offering attractive savings rates and consumer loans fell foul of Russia\u2019s economic slowdown. The country\u2019s central bank said it was providing up to 30bn roubles to help the medium-sized bank in what is thought likely to be the first of a series of bailouts made necessary by the near-halving of the global price of oil and the sharp fall in the value of the rouble. Russian MPs rushed through a bill last Friday authorising a 1tn-rouble recapitalisation of the country\u2019s banks, which have suffered big losses as a result of the currency crisis. The central bank\u2019s deposit insurance agency will be responsible for supervising Trust under a temporary arrangement until a new investor, likely to be one of Russia\u2019s leading banks, is chosen as a white knight. Trust\u2019s problems echo those of Northern Rock, the first bank to get into trouble in the UK when the global financial crisis broke in the summer of 2007. Like Northern Rock, the Russian bank had been offering loans on easy terms and paying annual rates of interest in excess of 20% on rouble deposits. Its difficulties have been made worse by western sanctions, which have made it impossible for Russian banks to get funding from overseas financial markets, and left them dependent on domestic investors. The rouble ended the day 3.6% higher at 56.1 against the US dollar, although its gains were checked by a 2.25% drop in Brent crude to $60 a barrel. The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told Middle East Economic Survey that Opec, the producers\u2019 cartel, did not intend to cut output \u201cwhatever the price is\u201d. \u201cWhether it goes down to $20 a barrel, $40, $50, $60, it is irrelevant,\u201d he said. Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest lender, was forced to deny a report that it had suspended taking new requests for car loans and mortgages. Russia\u2019s biggest oil firm, Rosneft, eased worries that it could default as a result of sanctions when it said it had made a $7bn debt repayment from its cash reserves. But Rosneft announced separately that a deal to acquire an oil trading business from Morgan Stanley had been terminated after it was refused clearance by US regulators.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As the economic recovery continues, 50% of British businesses are planning to take on extra workers in 2015, the CBI said, but skills shortage could stop jobs being filled. All regions of the UK stand to benefit according to the business lobby group, while Scotland has the biggest plans for the job creation. Employers also said they would give workers pay rises next year, though at a \u201ccautious rate\u201d as productivity remains weak and competition tough. Among firms polled for the CBI/Accenture employment trends survey 2014, 43% said they were planning pay rises in line with the retail prices index (RPI), at 2%. About 12% said they would hand workers pay rises above the RPI measure. UK workers are finally benefitting from a rise in real wages \u2013 where pay growth outstrips inflation \u2013 after six years of decline. The report found that more permanent than temporary jobs would be created. Katja Hall, the CBI\u2019s deputy director-general, said businesses were concerned that they would not be able to fill some jobs because of a lack of suitably skilled candidates. This, as well as worries over regulation directed at the flexible labour market, were considered the biggest workforce threats to UK competitiveness. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern that the UK\u2019s growing skills gap is now seen as the number one workforce threat to the long-term health of its economy,\u201d she said. The CBI has argued that controversial zero-hours contracts \u2013 where staff are hired without being guaranteed a minimum number of hours \u2013 are an important part of the jobs market. Zero-hours contracts, of which there are about 1.4m in the UK, have been criticised by unions, which claim workers employed on such terms are paid less on average and have fewer employment rights than permanent employees. The issue is likely to be debated by politicians in the run-up to the general election in May 2015. Hall said: \u201cUnstitching the fabric of the UK\u2019s flexible labour market would risk piling new costs onto businesses and ultimately put jobs at risk, so politicians must take care. \u201cThe UK\u2019s flexibility makes it attractive as a place to create jobs and it has been crucial to the recovery, allowing firms to hire quickly or tailor their staff levels to meet customer needs.\u201d She added that the living wage, based on the amount people need to earn to cover the basic cost of living and which is higher than the minimum wage, should remain voluntary. \u201cMany firms simply cannot afford it,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>As the economic recovery continues, 50% of British businesses are planning to take on extra workers in 2015, the CBI said, but skills shortage could stop jobs being filled.</p> <p>All regions of the UK stand to benefit according to the business lobby group, while Scotland has the biggest plans for the job creation.</p> <p>Employers also said they would give workers pay rises next year, though at a \u201ccautious rate\u201d as productivity remains weak and competition tough.</p> <p>Among firms polled for the CBI/Accenture employment trends survey 2014, 43% said they were planning pay rises in line with the retail prices index (RPI), at 2%. About 12% said they would hand workers pay rises above the RPI measure.</p> <p>UK workers are finally benefitting from a rise in real wages \u2013 where pay growth outstrips inflation \u2013 after six years of decline. The report found that more permanent than temporary jobs would be created.</p> <p>Katja Hall, the CBI\u2019s deputy director-general, said businesses were concerned that they would not be able to fill some jobs because of a lack of suitably skilled candidates. This, as well as worries over regulation directed at the flexible labour market, were considered the biggest workforce threats to UK competitiveness.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a concern that the UK\u2019s growing skills gap is now seen as the number one workforce threat to the long-term health of its economy,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The CBI has argued that controversial zero-hours contracts \u2013 where staff are hired without being guaranteed a minimum number of hours \u2013 are an important part of the jobs market.</p> <p>Zero-hours contracts, of which there are about 1.4m in the UK, have been criticised by unions, which claim workers employed on such terms are paid less on average and have fewer employment rights than permanent employees.</p> <p>The issue is likely to be debated by politicians in the run-up to the general election in May 2015.</p> <p>Hall said: \u201cUnstitching the fabric of the UK\u2019s flexible labour market would risk piling new costs onto businesses and ultimately put jobs at risk, so politicians must take care.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK\u2019s flexibility makes it attractive as a place to create jobs and it has been crucial to the recovery, allowing firms to hire quickly or tailor their staff levels to meet customer needs.\u201d</p> <p>She added that the living wage, based on the amount people need to earn to cover the basic cost of living and which is higher than the minimum wage, should remain voluntary. \u201cMany firms simply cannot afford it,\u201d she said.</p>",
