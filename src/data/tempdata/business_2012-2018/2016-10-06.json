      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has backed the prime minister\u2019s call to rethink Britain\u2019s economic policy and rejected the idea that criticism of the side-effects of unconventional measures amounted to an attack on the independence of the Bank of England. In his first public comments since Theresa May said there had to be a change to a system that was biased in favour of the asset-rich and those paying mortgages, Carney said: \u201cI entirely agree with the spirit of what the prime minister said. \u201cI have long said that monetary policy has been overburdened. There needs to be a better balance of monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural policy.\u201d His remarks at the International Monetary Fund in Washington came as the chancellor, Philip Hammond, sought to counter the suggestion that the government was unhappy with Carney\u2019s performance and was thinking of replacing him as governor. Carney again refused to say when questioned at the event whether he intended to serve a full eight-year term or leave Threadneedle Street in 2018 after five years. However, Hammond praised the way the Bank had responded to the turbulence that followed the EU referendum and said he would welcome Carney being in charge until 2021. \u201cThe Bank of England is executing its remit as an independent central bank, and [the] monetary policy committee is the arbiter on monetary policy decisions, in my view very effectively. They helped us recover from the financial crisis,\u201d Hammond said in a Bloomberg TV interview while on a visit to New York. \u201cThey have helped us to smooth the response to this shock that occurred on 23 June. \u201cObviously, Mark Carney said when he took the job on that he wasn\u2019t guaranteeing to stay for the whole eight years. He will make his decision in due course. And that is his decision. He made that very clear. But I certainly would welcome his decision to stay if that is the decision he makes.\u201d Carney said Hammond had already signalled his intention to reset fiscal policy in next month\u2019s autumn statement, adding that May\u2019s speech showed the government\u2019s intention to change the structure of the economy. \u201cThere is to be a rebalancing of policy in the UK, which will be part of a rebalancing around the world,\u201d he said. The Bank held interest rates at 0.5% for more than seven years before reducing them to a new record low of 0.25% in its post-Brexit package of measures announced in August. In early 2009, it launched the asset-purchase programme known as quantitative easing to expand the amount of money in the economy, under which Threadneedle Street purchased \u00a3375bn of gilts over the next four years. In August, the Bank announced that it was buying an additional \u00a360bn of gilts and \u00a310bn of corporate bonds. In her speech to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, May said the emergency action had been appropriate when the economy was deep in recession. However, she added that \u201cthere have been some bad side-effects\u201d. \u201cPeople with assets got richer, people without them have suffered, people with mortgages have found their debt cheaper, people with savings have found themselves poorer. A change has got to come and we are going to deliver it,\u201d she said. Carney accepted that some had benefited more than others from QE. \u201cEvery monetary policy action has distributional consequences. It is not for the central bank to address these consequences. It is for the government to offset them if they choose to do so as part of an agenda of more inclusive growth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Andreas Zarogiannis leans back in his chair, napkin pressed into the corner of his eye. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have tears,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m very, very sad now that it\u2019s going to leave Australia but it\u2019s not Ford Australia\u2019s fault. Whatever they asked in Ford America from Detroit to implement we did it \u2026 this is business, political stuff.\u201d It was \u201cbusiness, political stuff\u201d, like the refusal of the United States head office to import Australian-made Ford Falcons as police vehicles, that killed Ford\u2019s Australian export business and made the continued manufacture of cars at factories on the outskirts of Melbourne untenable, he says. Tears blotted, he keeps the napkin folded in his hand and speaks about the company to which he has devoted half his life. On Friday the 400 remaining workers at the Ford factory in Broadmeadows, 20km north of the city centre, will roll the last Australian-made Ford Falcon off the assembly line and leave the company for good. In the company\u2019s historical Australian home of Geelong, 80km south, another 200 workers in the stamping and engine plant will do the same. The shutdown date, 7 October, 2016, was announced in 2013. At the time Bob Graziano, the president and chief executive of Ford Australia, said rapidly declining sales of the Falcon meant \u201cmanufacturing locally was no longer viable.\u201d There will be a staff function at Broadmeadows on Friday, and a raffle. Zarogiannis will not be the only one to cry. Ford gave him more than just a livelihood, he explained. It gave him a life. \u201cWe got our house because of Ford. I married \u2013 at Ford, I met my wife. My children worked at Ford,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can I get that and not be proud of a company? I am still proud of that.\u201d Zarogiannis arrived at Tullamarine airport on a tourist visa from Greece on 5 October 1975; 41 years to the day before our conversation in a Broadmeadows coffee shop. Within four days he had a job at the Ericsson factory but was let go in a mass redundancy five months later. He walked down to Ford\u2019s Sydney Road assembly and was hired on the spot. \u201cWhen I went to Ford I was \u2026 at that time I cannot speak English, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of people there they speak two, three languages. They speak Greek, and then I communicated and they give me the job of electrical repair man on the cars.\u201d He learned English on the company dime (\u201cslow, slow, broken English, every one of us learn,\u201d he said), met his wife on the bus to work, and stayed at the company for 32 years until he took a voluntary redundancy and early retirement at the age of 59 in 2008. His son, Bill, works in the IT division of research and development; his job is secure. Zarogiannis\u2019 last 16 years at the company were spent as a shop steward and health and safety rep for the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU). He explains with considerable pride the systems developed and awards won for the factory\u2019s health and safety practices. Nine out of 10 workers at Ford shared his company pride, he said, and the 10th drove a Holden. \u201cI used to say to them, \u2018look mate. Ford at the moment give you bread and butter,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI always drive a Ford car.\u201d Also proud and tearful is Sam Gjurovski, who worked at the Broadmeadows factory for 34 years between 1970 and his retirement in 2008, with a few gaps. He arrived in Australia from Macedonia via Yugoslavia in 1969 and, like Zarogiannis, couldn\u2019t speak English. No one could, he said: \u201cJust bring your muscles, leave your brains at home and get on with it.\u201d When he started there were 6,000 employees from 78 countries at the 44-acre site and social cohesion was strictly enforced by the union. \u201c[They told us] we are all there to make a living, we are not there to solve the political problems of the world,\u201d Gjurovski said. When he visited the factory last week, the cultural diversity remained (20% of employees don\u2019t speak English at home) but the bustling sheds that had once been like a small tow\u201d were now \u201clike walking through a graveyard\u201d. \u201cAt times I was nearly to break down, in tears,\u201d he said. In the late 1990s before his appointment as chief executive, Jack Nasser would sit in the tea room at Broadmeadows and tell the stubborn Gjurovski that the car industry, with its high cost of production and export efforts hampered by protectionist trade policies in the United States, couldn\u2019t survive in Australia. Gjurovski always ignored him. \u201cOne day, when I drive past, I want to look around and say to my grandchildren, \u2018this place is still going. I was a big part in this place one time\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, I was in love with it. In love with the job and with the people.\u201d Zarogiannis and Gjurovski are not outliers. According to a survey by the Australian Catholic University, workers in Victoria\u2019s automotive industry averaged 50 years of age and 19 years with the same company. Were it not for the shutdown, they would stay with Ford until retirement. Of the 67% who said they intended to keep working, survey author Dr Tom Barnes said, about half said they wanted to keep working in the same field. That field is rapidly clearing. When Zarogiannis retired in 2008, Mitsubishi had just ceased production at its South Australian plant. Since then General Motors/Holden and Toyota have announced they would follow Ford in moving production offshore. Both will have closed their Australian factories by the end of 2017. Of the 409 people surveyed, Barnes said, 87% had not yet tried to find a new job even though 49% expected to be made redundant. \u201cSome of them have been to some extent institutionalised, and some of them will struggle with a working environment that is different to that,\u201d he said. A similar study by Flinders University of Mitsubishi workers 18 months after the closure of its Adelaide factory found high levels of job instability, with 38% having been through two or more jobs in the previous year. Workers from Ford are expected to fare better. They will leave with an average payout of $150,000, equivalent to two year\u2019s pay, and be connected to a job placement company that in 2014 had a 100% success rate in placing people made forcibly redundant from the company. They have been offered literacy and numeracy classes, been bussed to job fairs, and been connected to training opportunities in the industry of their choice. More than half of those made redundant have taken some form of training, a Ford spokeswoman said. \u201cI have seen good and bad examples of [car companies managing redundancies], and this is the best,\u201d Dave Smith, the national secretary of the AMWU\u2019s vehicle division, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey will come out job-ready.\u201d There is still work in manufacturing near Broadmeadows, particularly in local caravan-building businesses, but the hourly rate is two-thirds the $30 to $33 paid at Ford. The famously good conditions that inspired lifelong loyalty from blue-collar workers are not matched outside the car industry and, with the exception of the 160 redeployed to Ford\u2019s research and development division, which will continue to employ 1,500 people in Australia, those jobs are no longer available. In a sign of how much the automotive industry has shrunk, Ford Australia said its 2,000 employees across its remaining Australian divisions would make it the biggest automotive employer in the country by the end of 2017. \u201cWe also are investing more locally in R&amp;D than any other automaker \u2013 $300m this year alone \u2013 in advanced products and testing facilities across Australia,\u201d a spokeswoman said, adding Australia was \u201cone of Ford\u2019s global product development hubs\u201d. In Geelong, where Ford is the latest in a string of major employers to shut its doors, finding a work locally \u201cbecomes very difficult,\u201d Smith said. Both suburbs already have higher than average unemployment: Broadmeadows, at 22%, has the highest jobless rate in Victoria. Without the ready availability of jobs, Local MP Maria Vamvakinou said, new arrivals to Australia were denied the opportunity that earlier generations of migrants, including her parents, had to rapidly establish themselves and settle in. \u201cWhen something like this goes, you can\u2019t get it back again,\u201d she said. The emotional impact of losing the car industry was just beginning to be felt, Smith said. Ford brought in workers from mental health agency Beyond Blue and the union has opened its counselling hotline, but the stress of feeling an industry that has shaped identities and forged social networks has abandoned Australia can have fatal consequences. The Mitsubishi study found respondents had higher levels of mental stress and depressive symptoms than the general population of Adelaide, and at least one reported suicidal thoughts. Smith has already been to one funeral of a union member made redundant by another car industry player this year. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, speaking at Broadmeadows on Thursday, said the closure of the Ford plant was \u201cunimaginable\u201d and accused the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, of not doing enough to protect the jobs of blue-collar workers. Smith lobbed the blame back further to the 2005 free trade agreement with Thailand and trade agreements with countries like the United States, which he said allowed free imports to Australia while Australian exports were met with a wall of protectionist policies. \u201cThat\u2019s not free trade, that\u2019s just bullshit,\u201d he said. Last year the Coalition government, then led by Tony Abbott, backflipped on a plan to axe $500m from an industry assistance scheme after it was argued doing so could affect the components industry, which has not yet pulled out of Australia. Six months later crossbench senators accused the innovation minister, Christopher Pyne, of making an increase to that fund conditional on the Senate agreeing to pass welfare cuts. In the cafe at the Broadmeadows library, Zarogiannis says he is worried that some of his former colleagues will have no choice but to turn to welfare. \u201cMyself and my wife too, we\u2019ve never been, as they say in Australia, bludgers,\u201d he says, applying a sudden Australian accent and a certain amount of venom to the word. \u201cWe used to work hard and we achieve whatever we achieve by hard working. \u201cNow 600 people have to leave \u2026 some people, they are never going to find a secure job like Ford. Unfortunately things change in Australia and some people suffer, for sure a lot of people are going to suffer.\u201d",

Gjurovski always ignored him.</p> <p>\u201cOne day, when I drive past, I want to look around and say to my grandchildren, \u2018this place is still going. I was a big part in this place one time\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, I was in love with it. In love with the job and with the people.\u201d</p> <p>Zarogiannis and Gjurovski are not outliers. According to a survey by the Australian Catholic University, workers in Victoria\u2019s automotive industry averaged 50 years of age and 19 years with the same company. Were it not for the shutdown, they would stay with Ford until retirement. Of the 67% who said they intended to keep working, survey author Dr Tom Barnes said, about half said they wanted to keep working in the same field.</p> <p>That field is rapidly clearing. When Zarogiannis retired in 2008, Mitsubishi had just ceased production at its South Australian plant. Since then General Motors/Holden and Toyota have announced they would follow Ford in moving production offshore. Both will have closed their Australian factories by the end of 2017.</p> <p>Of the 409 people surveyed, Barnes said, 87% had not yet tried to find a new job even though 49% expected to be made redundant.</p> <p>\u201cSome of them have been to some extent institutionalised, and some of them will struggle with a working environment that is different to that,\u201d he said. </p> <p>A similar study by Flinders University of Mitsubishi workers 18 months after the closure of its Adelaide factory found high levels of job instability, with 38% having been through two or more jobs in the previous year.</p> <p>Workers from Ford are expected to fare better. They will leave with an average payout of $150,000, equivalent to two year\u2019s pay, and be connected to a job placement company that in 2014 had a 100% success rate in placing people made forcibly redundant from the company. They have been offered literacy and numeracy classes, been bussed to job fairs, and been connected to training opportunities in the industry of their choice.</p> <p>More than half of those made redundant have taken some form of training, a Ford spokeswoman said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some people, they are never going to find a secure job like Ford</p> <footer> <cite>Andreas Zarogianni</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have seen good and bad examples of [car companies managing redundancies], and this is the best,\u201d Dave Smith, the national secretary of the AMWU\u2019s vehicle division, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey will come out job-ready.\u201d</p> <p>There is still work in manufacturing near Broadmeadows, particularly in local caravan-building businesses, but the hourly rate is two-thirds the $30 to $33 paid at Ford. The famously good conditions that inspired lifelong loyalty from blue-collar workers are not matched outside the car industry and, with the exception of the 160 redeployed to Ford\u2019s research and development division, which will continue to employ 1,500 people in Australia, those jobs are no longer available. </p> <p>In a sign of how much the automotive industry has shrunk, Ford Australia said its 2,000 employees across its remaining Australian divisions would make it the biggest automotive employer in the country by the end of 2017.</p> <p>\u201cWe also are investing more locally in R&amp;D than any other automaker \u2013 $300m this year alone \u2013 in advanced products and testing facilities across Australia,\u201d a spokeswoman said, adding Australia was \u201cone of Ford\u2019s global product development hubs\u201d.<br></p> <p>In Geelong, where Ford is the latest in a string of major employers to shut its doors, finding a work locally \u201cbecomes very difficult,\u201d Smith said.</p> <p>Both suburbs already have higher than average unemployment: Broadmeadows, at 22%, has the highest jobless rate in Victoria.</p> <p>Without the ready availability of jobs, Local MP Maria Vamvakinou said, new arrivals to Australia were denied the opportunity that earlier generations of migrants, including her parents, had to rapidly establish themselves and settle in.</p> <p>\u201cWhen something like this goes, you can\u2019t get it back again,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The emotional impact of losing the car industry was just beginning to be felt, Smith said.</p> <p>Ford brought in workers from mental health agency Beyond Blue and the union has opened its counselling hotline, but the stress of feeling an industry that has shaped identities and forged social networks has abandoned Australia can have fatal consequences.</p> <p>The Mitsubishi study found respondents had higher levels of mental stress and depressive symptoms than the general population of Adelaide, and at least one reported suicidal thoughts.</p> <p>Smith has already been to one funeral of a union member made redundant by another car industry player this year.</p> <p>The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, speaking at Broadmeadows on Thursday, said the closure of the Ford plant was \u201cunimaginable\u201d and accused the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, of not doing enough to protect the jobs of blue-collar workers. </p> <p>Smith lobbed the blame back further to the 2005 free trade agreement with Thailand and trade agreements with countries like the United States, which he said allowed free imports to Australia while Australian exports were met with a wall of protectionist policies. \u201cThat\u2019s not free trade, that\u2019s just bullshit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last year the Coalition government, then led by Tony Abbott,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/10/coalition-reverses-500m-cut-to-taxpayer-assistance-to-auto-industry\"> backflipped on a plan to axe $500m from an industry assistance scheme</a> after it was argued doing so could affect the components industry, which has not yet pulled out of Australia.

Those investors who enjoyed the shares\u2019 splendid run from 300p in 2011 to \u00a318 in 2015 have discovered that volatility has not been abolished in the airline game. EasyJet says its profits will fall 28% in the financial year that closed last month. Its shares have almost halved in value in 12 months and now stand at 933p, down 7% on Thursday. The vote for Brexit is merely the lesser of two upsets. A weak sterling has been unhelpful to the tune of \u00a390m for a company that flies over so much eurozone airspace and pays so many landing charges in euros. The greater impact has come from disruption, strikes by air-traffic controllers and the effects of terrorist attacks in Nice, Paris and Brussels. Revenue per seat is running at 8% below last year, sending a strong signal that, behind a year of \u201cextraordinary events\u201d, there is a European short-haul market that simply has too much capacity. Cheap oil has encouraged too much expansion. Don\u2019t worry, the chief executive, Dame Carolyn McCall, says soothingly, \u201cthe current environment is tough for all airlines, but history shows that at times like this the strongest airlines become stronger\u201d. Ultimately, she\u2019s right. EasyJet still expects to make pre-tax profits of about \u00a3490m in the year. That is a commanding position from which to sit back and wait for weak airlines to shrink, go bust or seek shelter. The trouble is, the wait can be long in an industry where optimism is ingrained. Air Berlin is slashing capacity after being thrown a lifeline by Lufthansa but easyJet (and Ryanair for that matter) would prefer to see more radicalism. Meanwhile, easyJet itself has been adding capacity \u2013 6% last year, 8% this year. A cheerful interpretation says the new routes will intensify rivals\u2019 pain and bring long-term reward. Alternatively, easyJet has stepped up expansion at the wrong moment. A comfort for shareholders is a chunky dividend set at 50% of post-tax earnings, giving a yield of 5.7% at the reduced share price. But prospects for earnings themselves are the real worry. One tough year could be viewed as exceptional, but the City is expecting at least three before the clouds clear. That is how life used to run for airlines, and probably does still. Tough tactics backfire for HarbourVest\u2019s bid for SVG Capital It ought to be hard to lose a \u00a31bn takeover bid when you start with 51% support and are offering hard cash. Yet HarbourVest, the Boston outfit stalking the quoted private equity fund SVG Capital, looks to be heading for defeat. At the eleventh hour, SVG has produced a more convincing white knight than it had managed to previously. Goldman Sachs plus a Canadian pension fund \u2013 two credible outfits \u2013 have put an offer on the table worth about 680p a share, versus HarbourVest\u2019s 650p. Conceivably, SVG shareholders could still prefer the lower offer because it is more certain and the cash would arrive sooner. But that\u2019s not the way to bet. Two big institutions, Aviva Investors and Legal &amp; General Investment Management, have withdrawn their support for HarbourVest\u2019s proposal and SVG\u2019s share price, at 667p, says the Goldman consortium will win. The difference between the two offers works out at about \u00a335m \u2013 almost nothing in the context of \u00a31bn contest \u2013 but HarbourVest cannot match Goldman\u2019s price because it declared its bid \u201cfinal\u201d on day one. Aggression appears to have backfired. For the sake of a cherry on top of the cake, HarbourVest will probably lose. Well played, SVG chair Lynn Fordham, for scratching out a few extra quid for her shareholders, but HarbourVest\u2019s tactics were baffling. Andrew Tyrie: board record-keepers must do better The fastidious Andrew Tyrie strikes again. The chairman of the Treasury select committee is one of very few MPs who could provoke a heated argument over the accuracy of board minutes. He is also right to do so. Tyrie\u2019s complaint is that the minutes of the failed Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS were next to useless for investigators conducting postmortems. If the non-executive directors were doing their job of challenging management and assessing risks, it was impossible to tell from written records. Disagreements weren\u2019t routinely recorded, so the minutes could not serve as a \u201cblack box\u201d to help prevent future mistakes. Sort it out, Tyrie told the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (Icsa) last year. The body has failed to do so, says Tyrie now. Its response is \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and \u201cinadequate\u201d because it clings to the idea that directors must actively demand that their dissent be noted, he suggests. That, as Tyrie implies, seems unhelpful and defensive. Simon Osborne, who might have expected a quiet life as chief executive of Icsa, is the man in the firing line. \u201cI would be very grateful if Icsa could take another look,\u201d writes Tryie, terribly politely.

In an interview with Property Week, Lister said: \u201cThe way I see that going is guarantee money rather than anything else. \u201cSo it\u2019s about us going to a housebuilder and instead of expecting the normal build-out rate of 50 units a year we\u2019ll say, \u2018We want you to build all 500 in one go and what we\u2019ll do is guarantee to take them off you if you can\u2019t find a buyer.\u2019\u201d Property Week reported that the HCA would sell the homes on the open market or to private or social landlords, and that prices would be set before the government chose which schemes to back. Steve Turner, a spokesman for the Home Builders Federation, said the guarantee was part of a package of measures which should help small firms come back to the market. \u201cThe reason that you\u2019ve seen the number of small builders fall by 80% in the past 25 years is that building has become a very risky business. Any way you can derisk that process will help,\u201d he said. Turner said that under the plan, builders would enter into a contract with the HCA at the start of the building process. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that they are guaranteeing homes in places where there is no demand for them \u2013 there will be a very detailed contract ensuring that it is the right properties being built in the right market.\u201d He said he expected small firms and new entrants to the market to be the biggest beneficiaries of the fund, which is also expected to offer land on a \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d basis and with planning permission already granted. An HCA spokesperson said: \u201cThe HCA is exploring a number of ways that result in faster build-out rates. One of these is to share the exposure with the contractor in the rare circumstance that homes are not sold.\u201d In the 1980s, around two-thirds of new homes were built by small firms, but their contribution has now dropped to about a quarter. Recently the Federation of Master Builders (FMB) said that a lack of available and viable land was the biggest barrier to building for SMEs in the industry, while difficulty accessing finance was another key issue. The remaining \u00a33bn of the government\u2019s \u00a35bn investment pledge will go towards a housebuilding fund, which will also be administered by the HCA. It will provide \u00a31bn of loan funding to small builders and others creating small numbers of homes, as well as long-term funding for infrastructure which the government said would \u201cunlock a pipeline of up to 200,000 homes over the longer term\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "With investors cautious ahead of the US non=farm payroll numbers on Friday, markets slipped back once more. Brexit concerns and continuing weakness in the pound added to the nervousness, amid growing anxiety about whether the UK would stay in the single market. Things were not helped by a profit warning from budget airline easyJet. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.47% or 33.29 points at 6999.96 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.16% to 10,568.80 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.22% at 4480.10 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was the exception, up 0.09% at 16,491.62 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.24% at 8757.4 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.20% to 574.22 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 19 points or 0.1%. Meanwhile the pound is down 0.85% at $1.2640 - off its worst level of $1.2623 - and 0.42% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1324. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. At the IMF and World Bank meeting, there has been a strong defence of globalisation. Larry Elliott reports: The leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have launched a strong defence of open markets and free trade, as concern grows that the Brexit vote and calls for protectionism in the US presidential election represent a backlash against globalisation. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said international trade had been a force for good in the past few decades but that without a more equal division of the benefits of growth there was a risk of barriers going back up. As part of a concerted push back against protectionism, the World Bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, said China had lifted 700 million people out of poverty as a result of trade and opening its economy to competition. Kim said the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, the US presidential race and looming elections in Europe were adding to uncertainty. \u201cThese are all risks. Uncertainty is normally very bad for most developing countries.\u201d Outlining her global policy agenda, Lagarde said: \u201cPolicymakers should act and use a balanced mix of all policy levers to revive demand and raise productivity, and ensure the gains from technology and globalisation \u2013 which have led to unprecedented global welfare gains in recent decades \u2013 are shared more broadly. \u201cA retreat from globalisation and multilateralism is a serious risk at a time when international cooperation and coordination are as critical as ever.\u201d The full story is here: Following UK prime minister Theresa May criticising the Bank of England\u2019s quantitative easing programme and chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s subsequent comments backing Mark Carney to stay on at the Bank of England, the governor is defending himself in Washington. He said he agreed with the spirit of May\u2019s comments on QE and admitted monetary policy had \u201cdistributional consequences\u201d but said it was not the job of the central bank to offset those. And he said May\u2019s comments were absolutely not an attack on the Bank\u2019s independence. As a reminder, this is what May said: Because while monetary policy \u2013 with super-low interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 provided the necessary emergency medicine after the financial crash, we have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects. People with assets have got richer. People without them have suffered. People with mortgages have found their debts cheaper. People with savings have found themselves poorer. A change has got to come. And we are going to deliver it. Just days after all the excitement about the UK\u2019s leading index soaring through the 7000 barrier and heading towards a new high, it has sagged back below that level with a bit of a whimper. It has closed down 33.29 points at 6999.96 as the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union continued, with the trade off between migration controls and remaining in the single market still unresolved. Fears of a hard Brexit continued despite chancellor Philip Hammond maintaining the government would seek the right Brexit for both the UK and EU. Better than expected US weekly jobless claims - coming ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers - have renewed talk that the Federal Reserve would have leeway to raise interest rates, and thus helped push the dollar higher. That of course means the pound continues to be pressured, as if there were not enough negative noises around the UK currency. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: There were three G\u2019s selling off in markets; the Great British pound, gilts and gold. An apparent shift in UK politics under the wing of Teresa May towards an interventionist and anti-business agenda was not received well in markets. The pound slid again in what has become a relentless barrage of selling, UK government bonds were sold and the FTSE 100 underperformed its European peers. Comments from the German chancellor have also been taken as another sell signal for the pound. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: It seems that we are firmly back in Brexit-dominating territory \u2013 even the mildest squawkings from the news-wire are causing pain for the pound. Today it was the turn of Angela Merkel to make sterling\u2019s life even more difficult, the German leader resolute in her claim that freedom of movement is a must if Britain wants to stand any chance of remaining in the single market. This, alongside seemingly the very idea that Chancellor Phillip Hammond has had to make a trip to Wall Street to reassure US banks about London\u2019s position as a financial hub post-Brexit, has led the pound to its latest 31 year nadir against the dollar and a 5 year low against the euro. At the moment the pound is down 0.8% at $1.2646 and 0.47% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1319. Philip Hammond has also been on CNBC, reports Reuters: Any future decision on whether the British government should approve another round of quantitative easing to spur the economy will be taken \u201ccarefully and cautiously,\u201d finance minister Philip Hammond said on Thursday. \u201cI approved a round of quantitative easing back at the beginning of August as a response to the shock that the economy had felt, but we are conscious of the impacts that QE has and we will use it carefully and cautiously,\u201d Hammond, who is currently in New York, said in a television interview with CNBC. On Wednesday British Prime Minister Theresa May said low interest rates and quantitative easing have bad side-effects. And Reuters: British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Thursday that he would focus on increasing the country\u2019s economic output by improving productivity, but that overall growth could slow as Britain barred most low-skilled European Union migrants. \u201cWhat we need to drive is a growth in GDP per capita. We need to see our economic expansion coming from an improvement in productivity, not simply from bringing ever larger numbers of low skilled people into the economy,\u201d Hammond said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in New York. Economic data earlier on Thursday showed British productivity continued to lag other countries after several years in which growth has been driven by a growing workforce, which includes higher numbers of EU migrants. Hammond also said Britain\u2019s government was looking at the costs and benefits of remaining in a customs union with the EU, as being outside would have \u201cfrictional costs\u201d for manufacturers such as carmakers. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take on their interview with chancellor Philip Hammond: The U.K. will use Brexit to build on historic trading relationships outside of the EU, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond told Bloomberg TV in New York. \u201cWe want to get the right Brexit for Britain,\u201d Hammond told Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. He described the U.K. as \u201cmid-Atlantic in the way it does business,\u201d and said capitalism faced problems across the developed world. \u201cWe have a problem, not just a British problem but a developed world problem, in keeping our populations engaged and supportive of our market capitalism economic model,\u201d Hammond said. Hammond, who is on a visit to U.S. to meet Wall Street bosses and attend meetings of the International Monetary Fund, said he would make protecting London\u2019s financial sector a priority for him. \u201cIt will be one of the U.K. government\u2019s objectives to ensure that parts of the financial services sectors that are Europe-facing are able to continue doing business in Europe.\u201d Philip Hammond may not want to disclose whether he thinks the value of sterling is too high or too low, but he might be pleased to know it has come off its lows of the day. The pound is currently at $1.2646, down 0.8% on the day but above the new 31 year low of $1.2623 it reached earlier. Question: Should Mark Carney (one of Britain\u2019s best known foreign workers) stay on longer as Bank of England governor? I think the governor is doing a good job. The bank is fulfilling its remit very effectively. It helped us recover from the financial crisis and helped us smooth the shock that came on 23rd June. It is Mark Carney\u2019s decision...I would welcome his decision to stay if that\u2019s the decision he makes. And there the interview ends. Question: isn\u2019t UK economy doing ok? Media is focussing on backward data. UK economy was stronger than we thought.. but the concensus of forecasters is suggesting growth will slow as we go through period of negotiation until we have certainty over our position with EU. Business investment is the key focus. Business postpones decisions if climate is uncertain. We want to bring back certainty as soon as we can. Question: Investment outside London? We have a productivity problem in UK, and one of drivers is regional disparity. We are hugely underinvested in transport links [in northern region]. We will continue to support Northern powerhouse and other regions. On infrastructure, lot is done by private sector. In public sector, we have an opportunity to borrow cheaply and we have further capacity for targeted investments in productive infrastructure. But with our debt to GDP ratio we cannot have unrestrained programme of public spending. After shock of Brexit decision there will be a period of uncertainty, we have to support the economy through that. Question: Sterling gone down since Brexit. Does UK economy work at this level? We don\u2019t target exchange rate level. Market makes its judgement, and that can change quickly. The market determines the appropriate level and we are committed to free floating exchange rate system. Question: Theresa May seemed more critical of business than previous PMs. Is government anti-business? Absolutely not. We are pro-business. But we [Western economies} have a problem in keeping populations supportive of capital market model. People feel economy is not working for them, they are losers. We have to re-engage those people who feel they do not have a stake any more. We have to address signs of a sizeable amount of people becoming disenchanted. We have to deal with rogue operators. We have examples in UK of companies abusing market power, abusing workers. We have to deal with that. PM said there is a limit to the power of government but doesn\u2019t mean they have no power at all. They have to make sure markets work properly. Sending out strong message that best way to make people free and prosperous is to have a free liberal economy. Question: is there any economic advantage to Brexit? In the long term yes and outside the EU we will build on historic trading links. Our economy is more mid-Atlantic than Europe. One reaction so far: Question: EU will say you either get migration controls or single market. From conference it appears migration is more important. Hammond: I don\u2019t agree. There will be discussions and there will have to be give and take on both sides... if there is a solution that is advantageous to both sides. We don\u2019t delude ourselves our European partners owe us any favours. They still want access to UK market. It has to be a win-win solution. But we have to realise the Brexit vote said implicitly that we should not have freedom of movement in way we had in the past. That is about control, not saying people from Europe cannot come into the UK. This is a negotiation, we both have our starting positions and will discuss it. We have an economy heavily integrated with the EU after forty years. One of things we have to do is analyse benefits and costs of being in a customs union. Question: could we not have a longer transition period that 2 years? No doubt the process of negotiation is something we will begin to discuss. The arrangements for UK\u2019s exit, and arrangements for future relations. No one thought Article 50 would be used, it does not answer a lot of the questions. On passporting, allowing banks etc to trade across Europe: There are different options, passporting, equivalents. It will be one of our objectives that financial services companies doing business in Europe can continue to do so. On the number of foreign workers being limited: The problem is not highly skilled workers, banks, surgeons.. coming to the UK. The issue is people with low skills competing for entry level jobs. Our economy is growing but GDP per capita is not. Have to drive that. We will need some low skilled people but our demographics are different to elsewhere in Europe. We have population still growing before immigration. Hammond\u2019s interview is live, and begins with Brexit and the worries of financial firms about what it will mean for them. He says we don\u2019t recognise a distinction between hard and soft Brexit. It has to be the right Brexit for UK and EU. On financial services, he says it is an important part of the UK economy. We\u2019ll place high priority on right solution. There are some specific needs and issues we have to understand. On euro clearing, he said ECB tried before to force clearing to take place within EU, and the court said it had no power to make such a rule. When Britain leaves EU, there will be countries not in euro but in EU requiring protection of single market. So not clear ECB could require euro clearing to be moved. And after Theresa May\u2019s comments seen as critical of the Bank of England, Hammond seems more positive on governor Mark Carney: Philip Hammond\u2019s interview should be available to watch here shortly. And on the state of the UK economy following the Brexit vote: And following the UK productivity figures earlier: Interviewer John Micklethwait tackles Theresa May\u2019s criticism of business in her Conservative party conference speech on Wednesday: So Hammond is reinforcing the comments made by Theresa May over the weekend, which suggested immigration controls would take priority over remaining in the single market. (Those comments of course started this week\u2019s slide in the pound.) Earlier German chancellor Angela Merkel said that Europe\u2019s four freedoms of movement \u2013 for labour, capital, services and goods \u2013 could not be split up. If Europe didn\u2019t stick to the position that full access to the internal market is conditioned on freedom of movement, Merkel said, each member state would start doing what it wanted. UK chancellor Philip Hammond is speaking at Bloomberg and journalist Heidi Moore is tweeting the highlights: And on whether euro-clearing activities would move out of the City of London after Brexit, he said: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has been giving her press conference ahead of the fund\u2019s meeting in Washington. And in the wake of UK prime minister Theresa May calling for the benefits of globalisation to be shared by all, Lagarde said: The value of British government debt is falling today, matching sterling\u2019s selloff. This has pushed up the interest rate, or yield, on 10-year gilts to 0.89%, from 0.82% yesterday. That implies it would cost the government more to issue new debt. America\u2019s labour market continues to improve. Just 249,000 US citizens filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, down from 255,000. That\u2019s the lowest since April, and means the \u2018four-week moving average\u2019 of new claims has hit its lowest level in over 40 years;. And that\u2019s likely to help the US dollar strengthen, and mean more pain for the pound. Over in Germany: Deutsche Bank has announced plans to cut 1,000 jobs in its domestic market, as part of a restructuring plan. This takes the total of jobs being cut to 9,000, including 4,000 in Germany itself. The restructuring is meant to cut Deutsche\u2019s costs, and help it build up its capital reserves. There\u2019s still no word on the ongoing negotiations with the US authorities over a fine for mis-selling toxic mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 crisis. Over in New York, traders are expecting Twitter\u2019s shares to tumble when trading begins in one hour\u2019s time. Twitter\u2019s shares are down 17% in pre-market trading, after the Recode website reported that Google is unlikely to bid for the social media platform. The pound\u2019s still falling... down a whole cent today at $1.2640. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, reckons sterling is being hit hard by speculators who are determined to drive it lower. He says further losses are a real possibility: Bears are out for blood and they want to squeeze every single drop out of this trade. Although this is the most crowded trade on the street today, but it is not preventing them to keep piling up their bets. My biggest worry is that short squeeze can happen soon as we are approaching towards an important level of support which is at $1.25. However, if the selling pressure remains this aggressive, we could easily break this support and we could be looking at the level of $1.22. A wave of selling has just swept the pound down to a fresh 31-year low against the US dollar, just $1.2664. That\u2019s the weakest level since June 1985, and means sterling has lost more than three cents since Theresa May pledged to trigger article 50 by March 2017. Here\u2019s some chart action from the Financial Times\u2019s Katie Martin: Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to German investment giant Allianz, says Philip Hammond faces a very tricky mission today. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, El-Erian says Hammond will have to justify Theresa May\u2019s conference speech yesterday: I would hate to be the chancellor right now. He has a hard job explaining what his prime minister just said. Hammond has three tasks, El-Erian adds: He has to explain the notion of hard Brexit, explain PM\u2019s comments about the rootless international elite and the harm they create, and explain the criticism of the Bank of England. Wall Street may find some of this surprising, El-Erian adds, given that (in his view) the UK has benefitted a lot from globalisation, and the government has benefitted from the Bank of England\u2019s stimulus programme. Without low interest rates and QE, May would be facing an economic mess, he concludes. Sterling is coming under more pressure, falling by 0.6 of a cent to $1.2690, close to yesterday\u2019s 31-year low. Paresh Davdra, chief executive of foreign exchange firm RationalFX, says chancellor Hammond may get a sceptical reception from Wall Street bankers today: Philip Hammond\u2019s visit to Wall Street later today will see the Chancellor try to convince the US\u2019s biggest banks that Britain is open for business. It comes weeks after the Prime Minister\u2019s own talks with Wall Street bankers and is the latest in a series of international visits from UK ministers in an attempt to allay fears over Brexit and drum up support for new trade. Although previously met with scepticism due to the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, Hammond\u2019s visit will be the first since the likelihood of a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit by early 2017 was confirmed. The Chancellor is expected to tell Wall Street that the UK is still a financial hub for global business. The challenge he will face will be in reassuring banks that the UK is indeed still a safe-bet investment in a week that has seen the pound plunge to a new three decade low against the dollar on the prospect of \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit and businesses within the City of London warn that it could cost the city \u00a338 billion. Whilst a timetable for Brexit makes Hammond\u2019s job easier in some respects, it remains to be seen if Wall Street can be convinced by him.\u201d The pound has dropped by 0.25% today but is still clinging onto the $1.27 level. That\u2019s above yesterday\u2019s 31-year low, despite worries about a hard Brexit. Theresa May\u2019s broadside at ultra-low interest rates appears to be propping up sterling. Over in Greece, the unemployment rate has dropped to a four-year low, but remains far too high. The Greek jobless rate dipped to 23.2% in July from 23.4% in June \u2013 the lowest since March 2012, but more than double the eurozone average after years of austerity. The pound continues to bob around the $1.273 mark, as traders wait for news of Philip Hammond\u2019s meetings in New York. That\u2019s about half a cent above the 31-year low struck on Wednesday. Angela Merkel\u2019s comments about freedom of movement being intrinsic to the EU haven\u2019t eased concerns about a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019. And Theresa May\u2019s attacks on the wealthy \u2018global elite\u2019 have also left City investors feeling vulnerable. Chris Turner, the head of currency strategy at ING, explains: May has pushed her party way across the centre ground \u2013 taking issue with self-serving individuals and businesses and appealing to the non-metropolitan voter. That does not bode well for financial services in Brexit discussions. (Thanks to Reuters for the quote) Newsflash from Berlin: the German chancellor Angela Merkel is telling industry leaders that Brexit is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the EU. Merkel also says negotiations won\u2019t be easy and will determine what access each side has to the other\u2019s market. Talks cannot start until Britain triggers article 50, she says. The chancellor also warns that Europe\u2019s four freedoms of movement \u2013 for labour, capital, services and goods \u2013 can\u2019t be split up. If Europe doesn\u2019t stick to the position that full access to the internal market is conditioned on freedom of movement, Merkel says, each member state will start doing what it wants. Earlier today, Germany reported that factory orders jumped by 1%, thanks to a surge of domestic orders. This suggests that Europe\u2019s largest economy isn\u2019t being dragged back by Brexit fears (yet, anyway). City traders are speculating about how long Mark Carney will remain as Bank of England governor, after Theresa May attacked the Bank\u2019s loose monetary policy stance yesterday. Carney is expected to decide by the end of 2016 whether to do five years at the Bank (the original plan), or sign up for an extra three years. He arrived in July 2013. May\u2019s criticism could, perhaps, encourage Carney to exit gracefully in 2018 after all. Or he might decide that London remains the place to be, as the Brexit story plays out. May surprised the City by telling the Conservative party conference that ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing had disproportionately helped the rich. Charalambos Pissouros, a senior analyst at IronFX Global, told Reuters that this could signal a change of approach to monetary policy: In our view, this suggests that once (BoE chief) MarkCarney\u2019s term is finished at the BoE, he may be replaced by someone more hawkish on policy. One of the prime minister\u2019s advisers has hinted that the government is considering using the fiscal levers of spending and borrowing to generate growth. George Freeman told Newsnight: We have to think about, with money available at nought percent (how to) ... drive an industrial strategy, get infrastructure built. We need to make sure we are looking at all the mechanisms to making sure that money flows properly. Fears that the City will lose its EU \u2018passporting rights\u2019 have undermined the pound since June\u2019s referendum. Britain is already running a sizeable current account deficit of about 6% of GDP, due to the persistent gap between imports and exports. So if London financial companies are locked out of the EU, Britain will suffer a fall in \u2018invisible earnings\u2019. That could be compounded by a drop in physical exports, depending on the trade terms that Britain agrees with the rest of the world. Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, fears that the current account deficit will get even worse, pushing the pound down. He writes: There appear to be at least two reasons to believe that market fears about the consequences of a hard Brexit for continued large capital flows to the UK are not misplaced. The first is that, were the UK no longer to have ready access to Europe\u2019s single market for its exports, it would lose its attractiveness as a location for foreign companies\u2019 European investments. This was precisely the point that the Japanese government made at the September G20 meeting in China \u2013 when it publicly warned its UK counterparts of the likelihood that Japanese companies would relocate out of the UK in the event of a hard Brexit. The second reason is that a hard Brexit would almost certainly result in the loss of the \u2018financial passport\u2019 that City of London financial institutions currently enjoy for accessing the European market. A Financial Conduct Authority report in September suggested that as many as 5,500 UK financial firms could be affected by such a loss of passport rights. Major international banks including JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have warned that, if the City loses its financial passport, they will need to conduct at least part of their European operations from outside the UK. A key point that those in favour of a hard Brexit overlook is that a rapid drying up of foreign capital flows to the UK would have dire consequences for domestic living standards. A further currency dip would raise import costs and increase inflation. Moreover, there is a likelihood that domestic economic policy would need to be tightened \u2013 both to contain inflation and to make room for a large narrowing in the external current account deficit that foreigners would no longer be prepared to finance. UK households would be forced to reduce their consumption levels painfully, while businesses would be forced to cut back on their investment plans, to the detriment of future UK growth prospects. More here. HSBC has knocked up a handy chart showing some of the possible relationships that Britain could have with the EU (and what it is giving up): Philip Hammond needs to reassure Wall Street that London still wants to be a major financial centre, says the currency expert Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. He\u2019s concerned that the pound hasn\u2019t managed even a small rally this week, even though the latest economic data has been quite encouraging: The FX market, for one, needs a lot of reassurance. Sterling really ought to have managed some sort of short-covering rally in the last day or two, as the market slowly gives up all hope of a further rate cut in 2016. From here, in the absence of new news and with the major (depressing from the currency\u2019s point of view) speeches from the Conservative party conference behind us, the fall in the pound versus the US dollar will probably be slow. But steady ... Politics, eh? Ouch! Shares in easyJet have fallen by 6% in early trading, and the Brexit vote is party to blame. The budget airline has told shareholders that it expects pre-tax profit to fall by about 28% this year, due to the slump in the pound, recent terror attacks and industrial action. My colleague Angela Monaghan has the details: The British airline said currency movements would cost the company \u00a390m in the full year, largely because of the the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote on 23 June. EasyJet reports in pounds, but mosts of its costs are in dollars and euros. It buys fuel in dollars and pays air traffic costs and landing charges on its many European routes in euros. The Wall Street Journal has a grim chart this morning showing how the pound is close to its weakest level (when measured against a basket of currencies): London\u2019s stock market has opened without drama, with the FTSE 100 index gaining 10 points to 7,041. That\u2019s about 63 points below its record closing level. Bank shares are among the risers, after officials from the International Monetary Fund tried to downplay worries about Deutsche Bank\u2019s financial health yesterday. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is scrambling to New York today in an attempt to reassure America\u2019s biggest banks about Brexit. He is due to meet with Wall Street powerbrokers (the kind of elite savaged by Theresa May yesterday). He will say London plans to keep its position as the world\u2019s leading financial centre once the break from the EU is complete. Hammond will arrive hot from the Tory conference and is expected to say: One of Britain\u2019s great strengths is the ability to offer and aggregate all the services the global financial services industry needs. This has not changed as a result of the EU referendum and I will do everything I can to ensure the City of London retains its position as the world\u2019s leading international financial centre. Whether it\u2019s British employers or US firms who support thousands of highly skilled jobs in the financial sector, we are listening and taking the time to understand the issues thoroughly, in advance of opening negotiations with the EU. We will continue to welcome the best and brightest talent and organisations from around the world, including the US. While the government has not finalised its future approach to our relations with the EU, the government\u2019s position is clear; we want the best deal for trade in UK goods and services, including our world leading financial services industry.\u201d He\u2019ll be meeting with top executives from Citi, BNY Mellon, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and others with operations in the City. A report this week warned that a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 could wipe out 70,000 jobs and cost \u00a310bn in tax receipts. That\u2019s the worst-case scenario, if City firms lose their passporting rights, which let them sell services across the EU. Wall Street executives will want to hear that their concerns are taken seriously, following Theresa May\u2019s attack on \u201ccitizens of the world\u201d yesterday. They could also press Hammond on the idea that UK-based companies should provide a list of any foreigners on their books ... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Concerns over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU continue to weigh on sterling this morning. The pound has sidled back to the $1.271 mark in early trading, close to the 31-year lows plugged yesterday. Against the euro, sterling is close to a five-year low at \u20ac1.135. This week\u2019s tumbles have already forced Britain to surrender the title of fifth-largest economy (in local currency terms) to France. Yesterday, the prime minister, Theresa May, promised to build a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d after Brexit, telling the British public: \u201cCome with me and we\u2019ll write that brighter future.\u201d But is the UK going to lose its prized membership of the single market, in return for immigration controls? Analysts at PNC Bank explain why this is a worry: May\u2019s position substantially increases the possibility that the UK will give up its right to export financial and other services to EU markets in exchange for control over immigration \u2013 a \u201chard Brexit\u201d. The UK\u2019s exports of services to the EU account for more than 4% of the UK\u2019s GDP, so trade barriers to them would cause a serious negative shock to the British economy. Also coming up today.... Global policymakers are gathered in Washington for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meeting. World investors are pondering whether America\u2019s central bank might raise interest rates in November, following strong service sector data yesterday. They\u2019re also wondering whether the European Central Bank could start to \u201ctaper\u201d its bond-buying programme soon. In the City, budget airline easyJet, defence firm BAE Systems and furniture group DFS are reporting results. On the economic front, Germany has just reported a 1% jump in factory orders (more on that shortly). And at 1.30pm, we get the latest US weekly unemployment figures. That will set the scene for tomorrow\u2019s monthly jobs report. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day ...",

The challenge he will face will be in reassuring banks that the UK is indeed still a safe-bet investment in a week that has seen the pound plunge to a new three decade low against the dollar on the prospect of \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit and businesses within the City of London warn that it could cost the city \u00a338 billion.

That could be compounded by a drop in physical exports, depending on the trade terms that Britain agrees with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, fears that the current account deficit will get even worse, pushing the pound down. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There appear to be at least two reasons to believe that market fears about the consequences of a hard Brexit for continued large capital flows to the UK are not misplaced. The first is that, were the UK no longer to have ready access to Europe\u2019s single market for its exports, it would lose its attractiveness as a location for foreign companies\u2019 European investments. This was precisely the point that the Japanese government made at the September G20 meeting in China \u2013 when it publicly warned its UK counterparts of the likelihood that Japanese companies would relocate out of the UK in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The second reason is that a hard Brexit would almost certainly result in the loss of the \u2018financial passport\u2019 that City of London financial institutions currently enjoy for accessing the European market. A Financial Conduct Authority report in September suggested that as many as 5,500 UK financial firms could be affected by such a loss of passport rights. Major international banks including JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have warned that, if the City loses its financial passport, they will need to conduct at least part of their European operations from outside the UK.</p> <p>A key point that those in favour of a hard Brexit overlook is that a rapid drying up of foreign capital flows to the UK would have dire consequences for domestic living standards. A further currency dip would raise import costs and increase inflation. Moreover, there is a likelihood that domestic economic policy would need to be tightened \u2013 both to contain inflation and to make room for a large narrowing in the external current account deficit that foreigners would no longer be prepared to finance. UK households would be forced to reduce their consumption levels painfully, while businesses would be forced to cut back on their investment plans, to the detriment of future UK growth prospects.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.omfif.org/analysis/commentary/2016/october/on-the-road-to-a-sterling-crisis/\">More here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T09:49:48.678Z\">at 10.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57f60476e4b08ebe3d55755f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-06T08:00:51.273Z\">9.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>HSBC has knocked up a handy chart showing some of the possible relationships that Britain could have with the EU (<em>and what it is giving up</em>):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MxSba/status/783933535459676160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lost in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> options?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have launched a strong defence of open markets and free trade, as concern grows that the Brexit vote and calls for protectionism in the US presidential election represent a backlash against globalisation. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said international trade had been a force for good in the past few decades but that without a more equal division of the benefits of growth there was a risk of barriers going back up. As part of a concerted push back against protectionism, the World Bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, said China had lifted 700 million people out of poverty as a result of trade and opening its economy to competition. Kim said the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, the US presidential race and looming elections in Europe were adding to uncertainty. \u201cThese are all risks. Uncertainty is normally very bad for most developing countries.\u201d Outlining her global policy agenda, Lagarde said: \u201cPolicymakers should act and use a balanced mix of all policy levers to revive demand and raise productivity, and ensure the gains from technology and globalisation \u2013 which have led to unprecedented global welfare gains in recent decades \u2013 are shared more broadly. \u201cA retreat from globalisation and multilateralism is a serious risk at a time when international cooperation and coordination are as critical as ever.\u201d Lagarde said governments should press ahead with attempts to secure multilateral trade deals, despite the difficulties involved, while providing help for workers adversely affected by globalisation and technological change. She refused to comment on the American election, but made clear her opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s demand that protectionism should be used to repatriate jobs to the US. \u201cThe rhetoric against trade would do harm to the economy. I call it economic malpractice,\u201d she said. The IMF believes the political shifts that have led to huge support for Trump and the shock Brexit vote are the biggest current threat to a fragile global economy. Lagarde welcomed the UK\u2019s better-than-expected performance since the Brexit vote. Ahead of the EU referendum, she said the outcome would either be \u201cpretty bad or very, very bad\u201d, but speaking in Washington on Thursday she said the IMF had envisaged both mild and adverse scenarios. \u201cI am encouraged that, because of good policies and the cooperation of central banks, it is currently the mild scenario and not the adverse scenario.\u201d She has welcomed the government\u2019s announcement that negotiations on Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will begin by March next year, but said this week\u2019s sharp fall in the pound was the result of uncertainty about what Brexit would mean for the financial services sector and for trade. Following Theresa May\u2019s attack on ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing, Lagarde said: \u201cWe currently observe that monetary policy has been under a lot of pressure to act. It has been the first port of call. It has acted in many countries in isolation, which is not helpful. \u201cAll policies \u2013 monetary, fiscal and structural \u2013 have to come together. It can\u2019t just be left to central banks. They have used unconventional policies to explore unchartered territories with benefits so far. But it can\u2019t just be monetary policy.\u201d Kim said heightened political uncertainty coincided with the highest number of poor countries in recession since the global slump of 2009. He said growth in sub-Saharan Africa was expected to be 1.6% this year and 2.9% in 2017, insufficient to keep up with population growth of 3% a year. \u201cIf growth can\u2019t keep up with population growth it is essentially negative growth\u201d, he said.",

Uncertainty is normally very bad for most developing countries.\u201d</p> <p>Outlining her global policy agenda, Lagarde said: \u201cPolicymakers should act and use a balanced mix of all policy levers to revive demand and raise productivity, and ensure the gains from technology and globalisation \u2013 which have led to unprecedented global welfare gains in recent decades \u2013 are shared more broadly.</p> <p>\u201cA retreat from globalisation and multilateralism is a serious risk at a time when international cooperation and coordination are as critical as ever.\u201d</p> <p>Lagarde said governments should press ahead with attempts to secure multilateral trade deals, despite the difficulties involved, while providing help for workers adversely affected by globalisation and technological change.</p> <p>She refused to comment on the American election, but made clear her opposition to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump\u2019s</a> demand that protectionism should be used to repatriate jobs to the US.</p> <p>\u201cThe rhetoric against trade would do harm to the economy. I call it economic malpractice,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The IMF believes the political shifts that have led to huge support for Trump and the shock Brexit vote are the biggest current threat to a fragile global economy.</p> <p>Lagarde welcomed the UK\u2019s better-than-expected performance since the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Ahead of the EU referendum, she said the outcome would either be \u201cpretty bad or very, very bad\u201d, but speaking in Washington on Thursday she said the IMF had envisaged both mild and adverse scenarios.</p> <p>\u201cI am encouraged that, because of good policies and the cooperation of central banks, it is currently the mild scenario and not the adverse scenario.\u201d</p> <p>She has welcomed the government\u2019s announcement that negotiations on Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will begin by March next year, but said this week\u2019s sharp fall in the pound was the result of uncertainty about what Brexit would mean for the financial services sector and for trade.</p> <p>Following Theresa May\u2019s attack on ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing, Lagarde said: \u201cWe currently observe that monetary policy has been under a lot of pressure to act. It has been the first port of call. It has acted in many countries in isolation, which is not helpful.</p> <p>\u201cAll policies \u2013 monetary, fiscal and structural \u2013 have to come together. It can\u2019t just be left to central banks. They have used unconventional policies to explore unchartered territories with benefits so far. But it can\u2019t just be monetary policy.\u201d</p> <p>Kim said heightened political uncertainty coincided with the highest number of poor countries in recession since the global slump of 2009.</p> <p>He said growth in sub-Saharan Africa was expected to be 1.6% this year and 2.9% in 2017, insufficient to keep up with population growth of 3% a year. \u201cIf growth can\u2019t keep up with population growth it is essentially negative growth\u201d, he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "EasyJet is set for its first drop in annual profit since 2009 in a year blighted by multiple terrorist attacks, industrial action and a sharp fall in the value of the pound. In a trading update, the budget airline said it expected pre-tax profits to be in the range of \u00a3490m to \u00a3495m for the 12 months to 30 September, compared with \u00a3686m the previous year, a decline of about 28%. Shares in the company closed down almost 7% at 933.5p, making easyJet the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Carolyn McCall, the easyJet chief executive, said the company had faced a series of extraordinary events this year, but she remained confident in the business. \u201cThe current environment is tough for all airlines, but history shows that at times like this, the strongest airlines become stronger,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we will continue to invest for the long-term success of the business, establishing even stronger market positions, delivering excellent customer service and establishing new revenue opportunities for the future.\u201d The company said a combination of \u201cmajor external shock events\u201d would cost the company at least \u00a3125m, while currency movements would cost it \u00a390m, largely because of the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote on 23 June. People were less willing to fly in the immediate aftermath of attacks in Belgium and France, and air traffic control strikes led to disruption and cancelled flights. EasyJet reports in pounds, but the airline buys fuel in dollars and pays air traffic costs and landing charges on its many European routes in euros. In the trading update before its full-year results, easyJet said passenger numbers for the final quarter of its financial year were a record 22 million. Revenue per seat decreased by 8.7% over the three months, compared with the same period a year earlier. Cost per seat, including fuel, is expected to fall by 4.6%. McCall said: \u201cEasyJet continues to attract record numbers of passengers due to its wide range of destinations, convenient flight times and value-for-money fares. We have been disproportionately affected by extraordinary events this year but our excellent network, cost control and revenue initiatives, and our strong balance sheet underpin our confidence in the business.\u201d The airline said it would proceed with its strategy of building leading positions at important airports in key summer beach and European city destinations. EasyJet has sold about 45% of seats available in the current first quarter, in line with the previous year. Revenue per seat continues to decline at about the same rate as in the fourth quarter. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said easyJet was facing challenging times on a number of fronts and was one of the FTSE 100\u2019s worst performers since the EU referendum. \u201cThe group says weaker sterling is making going abroad less affordable for the average Brit, while the rising threat of terrorism is putting customers off too. These are industry-wide factors,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the competition is hotting up too. Other airlines are looking covetously at easyJet\u2019s market share, with pressure coming from the budget players Wizz and Ryanair, and \u2018premium economy\u2019 offerings like Vueling.\u201d",

Its shares are down more than 4% to 323.5p as analysts at Numis reduced their recommendation from hold to reduce with a 295p price target. In a hefty note on the retail sector Numis said there had been a bounceback from the immediate weakness post-Brexit vote, with consumer confidence recovering and trading - apart from weather related problems - holding up. But 2017 could be a little more difficult, the broker said: Looking ahead, 2017 is set to be a challenging, but not disastrous, year for the General Retailers. We expect the early effects of Brexit to weigh on employment growth, and drive some inflationary pressure on household costs, such that we expect retail sales growth of flat to +1%. On Marks in particular, Numis said the company\u2019s new strategy on pricing looked the right move but the jury was out on whether it would succeed: It said: Recognising after five years of negative like for likes that M&amp;S had \u2018clearly got its price dynamic wrong\u2019, new chief executive Steve Rowe announced a series of strategic volte-faces, including double-digit price reductions on 30% of the range, a shift back to \u2018good\u2019 product, reduced seasonal phases, and a de-emphasis of the sub-brands. Essentially, the new strategy, which may well be absolutely right, amounts to having the right product available on the shelves at the right price - we see little to argue with here, but have limited visibility on what will underpin successful execution. Food [is] a downside risk: Having successfully navigated the challenging deflationary environment over the last few years, it seems to be taken as read that M&amp;S will continue to weather the storm in its Food division. With like for likes having tipped marginally into negative territory in the first quarter, and while we see no imminent threat, we do see any weakness in the Food division as a meaningful downside risk. Given the warm August and September, M&amp;S\u2019 current trading will undoubtedly have been weak. As a result, we expect first half pretax profit to be in the region of \u00a3215m, which would suggest, even with a marked improvement in second half like for likes, full year pretax profit closer to \u00a3575m, if not worse. Versus current consensus of \u00a3590m, this suggests yet more downgrades to come. By our calculation, M&amp;S is now achieving a return on cash invested of just 5% and consensus expectations do not suggest any meaningful growth profile. Moreover, we are expecting downgrades in the coming weeks. And yet, on 11.2 times, it trades at a 10% premium to Next (10.2 times) on 2017 PE.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s productivity rate has returned to its pre-crisis level for the first time, but the country still lags well behind other major economies after years of sluggish growth. The Office for National Statistics said output per hour increased by 0.6% in the second quarter of this year and had at last recovered the ground lost after the 2008 downturn. However, underscoring the challenge faced by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who has vowed to improve Britain\u2019s lacklustre productivity, ONS figures for 2015 showed that the gap between Britain the rest of the G7 group of leading economies remained stubbornly wide. At 18 percentage points in GDP per hour worked terms, the divide was unchanged on the 2014 level and economists warned that pressures on UK businesses from the Brexit process could see the gap widen again over coming years. UK productivity was 27, 30 and 35 percentage points lower than in France, the US and Germany respectively. Experts have repeatedly highlighted Britain\u2019s poor productivity performance as a key factor in the squeeze on living standards in the years after the financial crisis. In his speech to the Conservative party conference this week, Hammond said: \u201cIf we raised our productivity by just 1% every year, within a decade we would add \u00a3250bn to the size of our economy \u2013 \u00a39,000 for every household in Britain.\u201d The failure to get UK productivity growing again since the downturn is known as the \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d, with economists offering varying explanations, including an over-reliance on low-paid work, a lack of investment and the idea that productivity cannot rise at a high rate for ever. The ONS noted that if pre-crisis trends had been sustained, output per hour in the UK would be 17.4% higher than it was in the second quarter. \u201cSince 2008, productivity as measured by output per hour has remained broadly flat, following a long upwards trend in prior decades,\u201d statisticians said. Britain was not alone in taking a hit to productivity from the financial crisis. Statisticians said output per hour was lower in all G7 countries in 2015 than it would have been had pre-downturn trends continued since 2007. The UK figures for the second quarter of this year, when the economy grew a relatively strong 0.7%, showed that output per worker was 0.2% higher and output per job was unchanged compared with the previous quarter. But average hours worked fell compared with the previous quarter, resulting in higher growth in output per hour of 0.6%, the fastest pace for a year. Output per hour in the services sector rose by 0.6% on the previous quarter and 1.1% on the year before. Output per hour in manufacturing rose by 2.2% on the previous quarter and was 1% higher than a year earlier. John Philpott, the director of The Jobs Economist consultancy, said news of an increase in overall productivity growth was encouraging, but warned that the process of leaving the EU fuelled uncertainty about the UK\u2019s ability to climb the international productivity rankings. \u201cWhile likely curbs on unskilled migration may aid productivity by removing the drip feed of cheap EU labour to less efficient businesses, productivity could suffer if anti-migrant sentiment prevents the UK from attracting talent,\u201d he said. \u201cFar more important, however, will be the impact of Brexit on business investment, which is almost certain to be adversely affected by short-run uncertainty, with longer run recovery critically dependent on the precise Brexit settlement the UK eventually reaches with the EU. Either way, there is little to suggest that the UK economy will any time soon begin to reverse its post-recession slide down the international productivity league table.\u201d Ian Brinkley of human resources trade group CIPD echoed this warning and said the onus was on Hammond to find ways to keep productivity growing. \u201cWith the long-term challenges posed by Brexit and wider adverse global trends, it is imperative that we do not let this recovery slip away,\u201d he said. \u201cSecuring a sustained recovery can only come from increased investment in people and new technologies. The forthcoming autumn statement needs to show how the government intends to support future productivity growth through investment in infrastructure, skills, and the science base.\u201d Others have urged the chancellor not to focus solely on high-value sectors, but look at productivity in the parts of the economy that employ low-paid workers. By broadening the industrial strategy to include low-paying sectors, the government could make greater economic gains, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said, and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of working poverty. The charity published an analysis this week showing that almost 1 million workers are trapped in working poverty in the retail, residential care, and hotels and catering sectors, in which productivity lags behind the economy as a whole.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are edging lower as investors again pause for breath after this week\u2019s attempt at a new record. Airlines are among the main fallers after easyJet, down nearly 7% at 934.5p, warned its full year profits would drop by around 28% this year after security concerns hit travel and the slump in the pound cost it \u00a390m. British Airways owner International Airlines Group is down 2% at 388.5p. Also among the losers is medical group Smith &amp; Nephew, down more than 3% at \u00a312.21. Its shares have gone ex-dividend but it has also been hit by a downgrade from analysts at Berenberg. They moved from buy to hold and cut their price target from \u00a314.85 to \u00a313.40, saying: Smith &amp; Nephew has gradually de-emphasised its slower growth areas and implemented various cost-savings measures, reinvesting the proceeds in faster growth areas of the business. However, the success of this strategy has been largely offset by various missteps and one-off headwinds, a trend we expect to continue. We have therefore become more cautious about the company\u2019s organic revenue growth outlook, as well as on margins and earnings growth. Tesco is down 4.05p at 203.05p on profit taking following its well received update on Wednesday. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 9.98 points at 7023.27, ahead of the start of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings and - the remaining piece of important data for the week - the US non-farm payrolls on Friday. With a US rate rise this year still a possibility and hopes that Deutsche Bank can find its way out of its current travails, banking shares are among the main gainers. Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 3.4p to 187.2p while Barclays is 1.45p better at 173.9p. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: Much better-than-expected services data out of the US Wednesday makes a December interest rate hike there more likely, which is great news for financial stocks. Banks were stronger in Asia, too, as traders bet that Deutsche Bank would not go under following reassuring comments from IMF officials in Washington. Shrinking oil stockpiles in the US have also sent Brent crude toward $52 a barrel, whetting appetite for risk assets like equities. Wall Street was up overnight, but Friday\u2019s monthly jobs data is the major focus for the rest of this week. Expect trouble if the number comes in below 150,000. GKN is leading the index at the moment, up 6.9p at 338.1p as HSBC analysts started coverage with a buy recommendation and a 395p target price. Among the mid-caps BTG has jumped nearly 7% to 691p after the healthcare group said current exchange rates meant its profits would now be ahead of its previous guidance of \u00a3510m to \u00a3540m. In a hold note Numis said: The statement is relatively light on detail but highlights a good performance in Specialty Pharma and Licensing. Interventional Medicine remains the fastest growing division led by the Oncology, tempered by the steady progress in Varithena and a decline in sales for PneumRx. But homeware retailer Dunelm has dropped 30p to 827.5p after it reported a 1.8% fall in first quarter sales due to unusually warm weather hitting demand.",

      "bodyText": "The dress code of the clientele in Planet Organic, Notting Hill is gym chic. On a hot day in mid-August, the men wore mid-thigh shorts, pectoral-enhancing vests, neon Nikes; the women were in black leggings and intricate ensembles of sports bras and cross-strapped Lycra. They had all either just worked out, were about to work out, or wanted to look as if working out was a constant possibility. They examined the shelves. As well as the usual selection of kale crackers and paleo egg protein boosters, there were promises of wizardry, such as a packet of Alchemy Organic Super Blend Energy Elixir (\u00a340 for 300g of powder). But never mind the food. Life, in 2016, is liquid. Opposite a display of untouched pastries and assorted bread products (who, in Planet Organic in Notting Hill, still eats bread?), were the waters. There was Life, Volvic, Ugly, Sibberi (birch or maple), Plenish, What A Melon watermelon water, Vita Coco, Coco Pro, Coco Zumi, Chi 100% Pure Coconut Water, Rebel Kitchen Coconut Water and coconut water straight from the nut (\u201cyou have to make the hole yourself\u201d, explained a shop assistant). Also: an electrolyte-enhanced water pledging to hydrate you with 40% less fluid than ordinary water (Overly Fitness), a birch water offering \u201ca natural source of anti-oxidising manganese\u201d (Tapped) and an alternative birch water promising to \u201celiminate cellulite\u201d (Buddha). There was also a \u201cwater bar\u201d \u2013 a tap in the corner of the shop \u2013 that, according to the large sign hanging from the ceiling, offered, for free, the \u201ccleanest drinking water on the planet\u201d, thanks to a four-stage process conducted by a \u201creverse osmosis deionising water filter\u201d. Planet Organic\u2019s display was impressive, but only hinted at the full range of waters available to the hydration-conscious consumer. Right now, the global bottled water industry is in one of those strange and energetic boom phases where every week, it seems, a new product finds its way on to the shelves. Not just another bland still or sparkling, but some entirely new definition of the element. It is a case of capitalism at its most hyperactive and brazenly inventive: take a freely available substance, dress it up in countless different costumes and then sell it as something new and capable of transforming body, mind, soul. Water is no longer simply water \u2013 it has become a commercial blank slate, a word on to which any possible ingredient or fantastical, life-enhancing promise can be attached. And it\u2019s working. Over the past two decades, bottled water has become the fastest-growing drinks market in the world. The global market was valued at $157bn in 2013, and is expected to reach $280bn by 2020. Last year, in the UK alone, consumption of water drinks grew by 8.2%, equating to a retail value of more than \u00a32.5bn. Sales of water are 100 times higher than in 1980. Of water: a substance that, in developed countries, can be drunk for free from a tap without fear of contracting cholera. What is going on? * * * For a substance that falls out of the sky and springs from the earth of its own accord, water has always had an extraordinary commercial lure. According to James Salzman, the author of Drinking Water: A History, monks at holy wells produced special water flasks for pilgrims to take away as proof of their visit \u2013 a medieval example of the power of branding. For centuries, wealthy Europeans travelled to spa towns to sample the water in a bid to cure specific ailments. The spa visit was a signal of health, but also of status: somewhere to be seen, an association of liquid and individual that broadcasted social elevation \u2013 a distant precursor to Kim Kardashian clutching a bottle of Fiji, if you like. In 1740, the first commercial British bottled water was launched in Harrogate. By 1914 Harrogate Spring was, according to its website, the largest exporter of bottled water in the country, \u201cproudly keeping the troops hydrated from England to Bombay\u201d. In the early 20th century, however, a water revolution nearly killed the nascent business. After early attempts in Germany and Belgium to chlorinate municipal drinking water, a typhoid epidemic in Lincoln in 1905 prompted the public health crusader Alexander Cruickshank Houston to try out the first extended chlorination of a public water supply. His experiment worked, and soon, chlorination of municipal water had spread around the world. In 1908, Jersey City became the first US city to use full-scale water chlorination, and the practice quickly spread across the country. The bottled water industry almost collapsed as a result. In the past, buying clean water had been a necessity for the rich (the poor simply endured centuries of bad drinking water, and often died from the experience). Now it was freely available to all. Why would you continue to spend money on something that now came, miraculously, out of a tap in your kitchen? The answer arrived in 1977, in the form of what must be one of history\u2019s greatest pieces of television advertising narration. \u201cDeep below the plains of southern France,\u201d rumbled Orson Welles in a voice that sounded as if it were bubbling up from some unreachable subterranean cave, \u201cin a mysterious process begun millions of years ago, Nature herself adds life to the icy waters of a single spring: Perrier.\u201d As viewers watched the water descend into a glass, and admired the glistening green bottle, marketing history was made. The advert was part of a $5m campaign across America \u2013 the largest ever for a bottled water \u2013 and proved a major success. From 1975 to 1978, Perrier sales in the US increased from 2.5m bottles to more than 75m bottles. The Perrier triumph was part of \u201ca perfect confluence\u201d, Salzman told me, of a sudden craze for aerobics in the US, prompted, in part, by Jane Fonda releasing her first exercise video \u2013 Jane Fonda\u2019s Workout, the highest-selling video of all time \u2013 in 1982. There was a new drive not just to be healthy, but to be seen to be healthy. In 1985, Time magazine noted that \u201cwater snobbery has replaced wine snobbery as the latest noon-hour recreation. People order their eau by brand name, as they once did Scotch.\u201d Soon enough, rumours circulated of Madonna bathing in bottled water, and Jack Nicholson was photographed brandishing a bottle of Evian at the Oscars as if it were Cristal. There was also a key practical innovation: in 1977, plastic or PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles were introduced into the soft drink market. By 1990, they were being used for bottled water, making it as convenient and portable as a fizzy drink. The big soft drink brands, spotting the obvious commercial opportunity, soon launched their own waters: PepsiCo\u2019s Aquafina in 1994, Coca-Cola\u2019s Dasani in 1999, and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Pure Life in 2002. Water was back. Water\u2019s glorious renaissance wasn\u2019t just about fashion or convenience. Bottled water can be marked up like no other substance on earth. The \u00a31 that a bottle of water often costs could pay for around 1,000 gallons of tap water. Some waters \u2013 Evian, Perrier, Highland Spring and Harrogate Spring \u2013 come from natural sources, so at least you feel you\u2019re paying for geography, for the fantasy of a shepherd sitting on a rock catching the icy flow in a glass jar specifically for your pleasure. But plenty of bottled waters are simply refashioned tap water. In February 2004, Coca-Cola attempted to launch Dasani in the UK. (\u201cDasani\u201d, by the way, means nothing.) Five weeks later, the company took all 500,000 bottles off the shelves after headlines such as the Daily Star\u2019s \u201cAre They Taking Us For Plonkers!\u201d Coca-Cola had followed its successful strategy in the US and purified tap water, added some mineral salts, and was selling it for 95p a bottle. The company hadn\u2019t, however, accounted for Britain\u2019s long memory for sitcom storylines \u2013 in this case, the episode of Only Fools and Horses when Del Boy and Rodney bottle tap water in their flat and sell it as Peckham Spring. Then there was the issue of a batch of minerals contaminating Dasani with a possibly carcinogenic bromate. In a little more than a month, Dasani was dead. Ten years later, Coca-Cola launched a new bottled water in the UK. In the intervening decade, the industry, after a brief dip following the 2008 financial crash, had entered its hyperactive new phase. Vita Coco \u2013 one of the first of the \u201cnew\u201d waters \u2013 came to the UK in 2009, and in its wake soon appeared a flotilla of further coconut waters (the coconut water market is now worth \u00a3100m in the UK). The industry received a further boost this year from the former chancellor George Osborne, who announced a sugar tax on soft drinks in his final budget. As the \u201cplain\u201d bottled water market continued to expand, new inventions began to spring up. \u201cStrong established growth leads to offshoots,\u201d explained Richard Hall, chairman of Zenith International, a market research company that organises the annual and thrillingly named Global Bottled Water Congress. Water had begun its reinvention: enter maple, birch, energy and even ocean. Coca-Cola\u2019s new water is called Glac\u00e9au Smartwater. The water, which comes from a spring in Morpeth, Northumberland, is \u201cvapour distilled\u201d, then injected with electrolytes. In other words, the water is evaporated and then condensed again, a process Coca-Cola describes as being \u201cinspired by the clouds\u201d. Ten years ago, this, surely, would have got the Peckham Spring treatment from the media. But we live in new times. Glac\u00e9au Smartwater is now worth \u00a321.9m, and, earlier this year, Coca-Cola announced an investment of \u00a315m to expand the factory where it is produced. At present, it turns out 56,000 bottles of water per hour. * * * If the last decade witnessed water\u2019s great commercial expansion, 2016 could perhaps be defined as the year the market lost its mind. There now seems to be no limit on what a water can be, or what consumers are willing to buy. It is no longer enough for water to simply be water: it must have special powers. This summer alone saw the launch of Fl\u00f5 Essence Water, Omega Enhanced Health Water, BiPro Protein Water and Svalbar\u00f0i polar iceberg water. Other recent additions include blk. water (black water), FATwater (water containing \u201cquality fat\u201d) and deep ocean water harvested from off the coast of Hawaii (which allegedly hydrates you twice as fast as \u201cnormal\u201d water). In July, the Evening Standard ran an article that only semi-ironically described water as a \u201csuperdrink\u201d. Powering this proliferation of new brands is a new breed of start-upper: the water entrepreneur. I met one such man \u2013 a 27-year-old named Rahi Daneshmand \u2013 in Planet Organic on that hot August day, doling out samples of his new product, Virtue Energy Water. Virtue offers, in a 250ml can (\u00a31.35), a sugar-free sparkling water that contains \u201cyerba mat\u00e9\u201d, ginseng, citric acid, guarana and natural fruit flavours, and offers a \u201cnatural\u201d caffeine hit equivalent to a cup of coffee. It comes in two flavours, berries and lemon and lime. The response from the clientele was varied: \u201cMore fun than normal water!\u201d said one woman, taking a sip. \u201cIt\u2019s not too sweet,\u201d approved another. \u201cI\u2019m trying to avoid sweetness.\u201d Some were a little bemused. \u201cNatural caffeine? What\u2019s that?\u201d asked a younger customer. \u201cIs it for the 3pm slump or after clubbing? What\u2019s it for?\u201d Virtue is Daneshmand\u2019s big idea. In fact, it\u2019s his second big idea \u2013 after Virtue Iced Tea, which did quite well (it\u2019s stocked on Ocado). In his mind, iced tea has now been surpassed by the great hope of his new creation, which he claims is Britain\u2019s first ever naturally sugar-free energy water. Daneshmand is a committed, joyous entrepreneur. After a few childhood years in Iran, he moved back to England with his family, went to Newcastle University, and somewhere along the way picked up the look and accent of an indefatigably cheerful rugby player. He wears polo shirts, lives by mantras \u2013 \u201cnothing in life is worth getting stressed about\u201d \u2013 and is the kind of hyper-motivated person who reads two business books in a weekend. (In mid-August: Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organisation and Ego is the Enemy.) Daneshmand says he went into water because he wanted to make something pure. \u201cWater is something that everyone needs and something that everyone drinks,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe went with the term water because it has zero sugar.\u201d This, he pointed out, is not always the case. Many of the so-called \u201cwaters\u201d crowding the market are jammed with sugar. Coca-Cola\u2019s Glac\u00e9au Vitaminwater (\u201cvitamins. electrolytes. unstoppableness\u201d) used to contain 23g of sugar, until the public outcry forced the company to start swapping sugar for the sweetener stevia. (Then there was a subsequent outcry about the new taste, so it swapped back.) \u201cPeople are just trying to put water into everything,\u201d said Daneshmand, shaking his head. His water, from the mains supply, is subject to \u201cultra-filtration and reverse osmosis\u201d to remove minerals and make it \u201cclean\u201d. Its added ingredients are entirely natural. On this point, Daneshmand is evangelical: \u201cThat\u2019s what a water is and what a water should always be.\u201d One afternoon this summer, I watched Daneshmand pitch his water to Rahil Vora, managing director of the health food chain Revital. Things seemed to be going well. It was a fiercely hot day, which made any cold liquid seem appealing, and there was the happy synchrony that both Virtue and Revital had incorporated a leaf into their logo. Moreover, Vora was buying into the concept. \u201cI like the fact that it\u2019s an energy \u2018water\u2019 rather than an energy \u2018drink\u2019,\u201d he said. He liked the can, too \u2013 more environmentally friendly than a plastic bottle \u2013 and the natural ingredients, yerba mate in particular. \u201cYou know about it?\u201d said Daneshmand, almost disappointed. \u201cIn south America they drink it religiously \u2013 it\u2019s their equivalent of tea.\u201d Vora didn\u2019t need schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s going to pick up as a trend,\u201d he said. \u201cGive it a year and you\u2019ll see it become not quite as big as green tea but \u2026 it\u2019s one of those ingredients.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said Daneshmand. \u201cWe put the accent on the mat\u00e9 as I think people were reading it as yerba mate.\u201d New water samples were arriving on Vora\u2019s desk every week. \u201cIt\u2019s a fashion thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWater in a can was the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Water in a can? \u201cLiterally. I got sent a box of samples. And it was just water. In a can.\u201d Vora shook his head in disbelief. No yerba mate, no aloe, nothing \u2013 330ml for 99p. Vora paused. \u201cFor water, though.\u201d * * * Water in a can, it turned out, was CanO water, launched by three young British entrepreneurs in January this year. I went to see them in their office in Stanmore, north London \u2013 one room, laptops, a mini basketball hoop on the wall. Ariel Booker, 24, and Perry Fielding, 29, sat opposite each other. (Their third cofounder, Josh White, was away.) Business was going well. Before they had formally launched, CanO had secured the right to supply London Fashion Week and a purchase order from Selfridges, which has banned all plastic bottles from its store as part of its environmental programme, Project Ocean. (CanO also managed to land a celebrity endorsement on Instagram from the model David Gandy: \u201cNo excuses not to be hydrated this summer\u201d.) By March, CanO was stocked in Whole Foods. I mentioned Vora\u2019s bewilderment at their product. \u201cWe have this problem on the phone,\u201d said Booker, the fast-talker, in a monochrome printed shirt and silver bracelet. \u201cWithout seeing it, it can be a bit mind-boggling! Why? What? How? When?\u201d \u201cPeople just think of it as a Coke can filled with water,\u201d said Fielding, the creative, a sun tattoo on his arm and silver chain around his neck. \u201cIt seems very unexciting when you think of it like that.\u201d Everything changes, they believe, when you see CanO. The water, which comes from the foothills of the Austrian alps, is packaged in a minimalist black (sparkling) or white (still) can. \u201cThe visual aspect dictates everything we do,\u201d said Fielding. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just a product or a company or a drink, it\u2019s actually an aspirational brand that you\u2019d want to buy into.\u201d On the brand\u2019s Instagram feed, the cans pose sexily next to MacBook Airs, old-fashioned cameras, swimming pools and YSL handbags. Water just happens to be the thing inside. Fielding had the eureka moment last year while drinking a canned fizzy drink. \u201cIt just dawned on me, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great to be able to drink water out of a can?\u2019\u201d The can, made of aluminium, is easily recyclable and has a resealable lid \u2013 a piece of German design that means you can put the can back in your bag without worrying about it leaking. \u201cI think some people look at this and think it\u2019s a gimmick,\u201d said Fielding. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve packaged it nicely doesn\u2019t actually make it a gimmick.\u201d The brand name, meanwhile, was their second choice. Fielding originally wanted to call the product \u201cWater\u201d, but lawyers informed him that you couldn\u2019t trademark the word that simply described the contents of the can. * * * The arrival of plain water in a pretty German-engineered can feels like some kind of apex, where the market\u2019s relentless demand for novelty has pushed a basic substance to its limit. We are surely only a small step from the unquestioned purchasing of emotions or air. (This, inevitably, is already happening: as Andrea Leadsom excitedly pointed out in her recent Tory party conference speech, a young British entrepreneur, Leo de Watts, now sells glass jars of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Welsh or Yorkshire air for \u00a380 each, mostly to the Chinese.) Even those in the bottled water industry find some of the newer arrivals perplexing. Everyone has their pet farce. For Ariel Booker of CanO, it was black water: \u201cWhat is the need to have water that\u2019s black?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is none.\u201d For Daneshmand, it was Rockstar, an American \u201cenergy water\u201d brand that had the same sugar volume as Red Bull (9g per 100ml). \u201cAbsolutely mad, that was.\u201d Martin Riese, whose website describes him as \u201cthe world\u2019s foremost expert on water\u201d, directs his disdain at Glac\u00e9au Smartwater: \u201cSorry, Smartwater, but you are not a premium product,\u201d he told me in his thick German accent. \u201cYou are a highly processed product and your water belongs in the trash can, nowhere else!\u201d For Riese, a purist, \u201cbottled water has to come from nature\u201d. Any kind of processing is, he believes, \u201cthe biggest scam on planet Earth!\u201d Riese really, really loves water. \u201cIt started for me as a very small child,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was four years old, on vacation with my parents, and I was blown away by the fact that the tap water in the city tasted differently.\u201d After school, he started working in restaurants in Germany, put together what was possibly the world\u2019s first water menu in 2005 for a Berlin bistro, and wrote a book: Die Welt des Wassers (The World of Waters). \u201cIt\u2019s a German book, so you\u2019ll have to learn to read German to read it.\u201d Over the years, Riese has become part of water history. After receiving his certificate as a mineral water sommelier from the German Mineral Water Trade Association, he moved to America in 2010 and became that country\u2019s first water sommelier. In 2013, he launched the longest water menu in Los Angeles at Ray\u2019s and Stark Bar, and cofounded his own brand of mineral water: Beverly Hills 90H20. This self-proclaimed \u201cchampagne of waters\u201d quickly won FoodBev Media\u2019s Beverage Innovation award for the \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Still or Sparkling Water\u201d. A case of 24 500ml bottles is $72, while a bottle from the \u201cLuxury Collection, Diamond Edition\u201d will cost you $100,000. It has a white gold cap set with more than 850 white and black diamonds and holds the profoundly questionable honour of being the world\u2019s most expensive bottle of water. If you buy it, Riese will present the bottle to you in person at a private water tasting anywhere in the world. At present, Riese sommeliers at Patina, a restaurant in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. There, he guides the diners through his water menu, helping them to select the ideal water to accompany their meal. Riese talked me through his technique. First: \u201cDo you prefer sparkling or flat?\u201d Then: \u201cDo you prefer your bubbles a little bit more progressive, like very intense, or do you like your bubbles a little bit on the smaller side, like champagne bubbles, very tiny?\u201d Finally: \u201cDo you prefer something on the high mineral end, on the salty and bitter side, or do you prefer something on the smoother side, with a lower mineral composition, like maybe a little bit on the fruitier side?\u201d \u201cPeople will tell you right away, then, what they want,\u201d said Riese. Perhaps the clientele at the Patina restaurant are better versed in the mineral composition and fruity or salty aspects of water than the rest of us. At a basic level, the taste of water varies according to the total dissolved solids (TDS) it contains. These solids can be any substance, but the key elements are sodium, magnesium and calcium. Any filtered or chemically treated tap water will usually contain fewer solids than a bottled water that still carries the minerals from the water\u2019s source, be it glacial, maple sap or spring. Fiji water, for example, contains 210mg/L TDS, including 18mg/L sodium, 13mg/L magnesium and 18mg/L calcium. (Fiji appears to have pulled off some fairly heavy-duty trademarking, including \u201cUntouched by man\u2122\u201d and \u201cEarth\u2019s finest water\u2122\u201d.) Compare those numbers to San Pellegrino, which contains quadruple the TDS, at 925mg/L, including 33.6mg/L sodium, 53.8mg/L magnesium and 178mg/L calcium. Fiji, with far fewer solids, tastes smoother, while the San Pellegrino is bolder, saltier and naturally fizzy. Nothing, however, compares to Riese\u2019s favourite water, the Slovenian spring water Roi. \u201cI\u2019m always calling it the Big Boy,\u201d said Riese. Roi has a TDS of 7,400mg/L, including more than 1,000mg/L of magnesium. For Riese, the experience of drinking this water is extraordinary, and emotional. He sits with a glass on its own \u2013 no mixer, no food, no distraction \u2013 as if he\u2019s drinking a rare cognac. \u201cThis is something very, very special.\u201d Riese knows how his obsession with water might be perceived. \u201cSome people think I\u2019m the biggest scam artist,\u201d he told me. He believes that he is simply applying the principle of wine to water \u2013 terroir. The taste of natural water, just like wine, is affected by geography, earth, the rock it passes through. And Roi is the ultimate example: \u201cIt has way more electrolytes than Gatorade,\u201d Riese said, his voice climbing in ecstasy. \u201cThink about it! Way more electrolytes than Gatorade! But it\u2019s from Mother Nature!\u201d * * * Take an investigation into the bottled water industry to its logical conclusion and you find yourself drinking melted icebergs. Last year, the Merchant hotel in Belfast launched its water menu to a global chorus of tabloid mockery. \u201cWould you pay \u00a326 for a bottle of water (even if it IS from a Canadian glacier)?\u201d ran the Daily Mail headline. Gavin Carroll, the Merchant\u2019s general manager, gave the whole episode its only possible name: Watergate. When I visited this summer to sample the menu, he still seemed a little puzzled by the reaction. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Really? It\u2019s just water.\u2019\u201d For \u00a326? \u201cWe\u2019re a five-star hotel. We have to offer our customers choice.\u201d The Merchant\u2019s executive chef, and the chief architect of the water menu, Patrick Leonard \u2013 a man so passionate about water that before every sip I took, I could sense him shuffling to the edge of his seat in anticipation \u2013 brought out the notorious \u00a326 bottle, called Iceberg. The water comes from the Canadian Arctic ice shelf in Newfoundland, frozen around 10,000 years ago. \u201cThey\u2019re not allowed to remove parts of icebergs,\u201d said Leonard, \u201cso they have to wait until they separate. They detach naturally, and then they\u2019re netted, brought on a boat to land and allowed to melt.\u201d It\u2019s a beautiful thing, this bottle \u2013 more like a premium vodka bottle, made of thick glass, decorated with white snowflakes. Leonard poured a portion of the ancient iceberg into a tumbler. The pressure mounted; I was painfully aware that the glass of water in front of me was worth a tenner, and I still had my bottle of airport-purchased Boots\u2019 own brand on the table. I sipped, swallowed, felt the passage of liquid down my oesophagus \u2013 and couldn\u2019t taste anything at all. This was not a total failure of my unsophisticated palate. Melted iceberg essentially has no taste, having the lowest TDS (9mg/L) of any water on earth. It is like the ur-water, the water that pre-dates all other waters. \u201cThis is your starting point,\u201d said Leonard, gravely. \u201cYour baseline.\u201d We moved on to Whitehole Springs, a Somerset-sourced, calcium-rich still water that passes through Tufa rock; Vichy Catalan, a salty Spanish sparkler; and finally De L\u2019Aubier Sap Water, from Canada, a byproduct of the maple syrup manufacturing process. Along the way, Leonard explained the origin of his water preoccupation: a radio interview he heard with \u2013 who else? \u2013 Martin Riese: \u201cIt just got me hooked; that was it.\u201d For a chef already infatuated by taste, water was the natural extension. \u201cWe pay so much attention to food and wine, but we forget about the water,\u201d he said. His favourite? Vichy Catalan. \u201cI just had friends for dinner, and instead of bringing out the wine, I brought out three bottles of that.\u201d He looked absolutely delighted. \u201cIt was so much fun!\u201d It\u2019s hard to maintain cynicism in the face of a true enthusiast. Leonard loves water so much he has water parties. This is not to be mocked. And, I\u2019ll admit it, tasting this quartet of waters taught its own lesson. Pay attention, as with anything, and you notice more, appreciate more. These waters tasted dramatically different from each other, had their own peculiarities and characteristics. The maple sap water was sweet, earthy; Whitehole Springs thicker and chalky. And after the featureless purity of the melted iceberg, the Vichy Catalan was like snorting peppercorns. Of course, there is something deranged about the idea of netting an iceberg and waiting for it to melt \u2013 apparently, applying heat would ruin the taste. There is also something disturbing about paying nearly \u00a330 for the experience of drinking the end result. But, for the connoisseur, all of this makes as much sense as buying a vintage claret instead of Jacob\u2019s Creek, a fillet steak instead of a Peperami. Passion has no limit. * * * At some point, surely, we will reach \u201cpeak\u201d water. Perhaps it will be the moment consumers lose faith in the cellulite-eradicating powers of Buddha water or wonder if it\u2019s really worth paying over the odds for birch sap. You hope for cold logic to kick in, some sort of mass awakening to this lunatic capitalist experiment. What are we even looking for, in all these waters? The same thing, perhaps, that we are hoping to find when we buy quinoa crisps, or gluten-free seed bars: perfect health, moral relief, a sense of inner purity that somehow erases all the wine we drank last night. We want to be better people. The peak, however, is not in sight: for now, experts can only see growth steadily increasing in the bottled water market, at 5-6% across the industry over the next five years, according to Zenith\u2019s Richard Hall. The water entrepreneurs are yet to run out of ideas. There are waters that haven\u2019t even been thought of yet, niches still to be fully explored. Minor brands \u2013 the endless coconut waters \u2013 will fall away over time, said the water historian James Salzman, and \u201cyou\u2019ll be left with those who have survived, who will be purchased by the major players\u201d. For the young entrepreneurs, like CanO and Virtue, the future is about staying in the game, making a product that a consumer didn\u2019t even know they needed six months ago, but that now inhabits their fridge door with the permanence of ketchup. In early autumn, things were going well \u2013 both Revital and Holland &amp; Barrett had ordered Virtue for their shops and Daneshmand had meetings set up with two of the four largest supermarket chains (he was too coy to name them). CanO, meanwhile, had shipped its first orders to China, Germany and Thailand. If there is a final frontier of water, then perhaps it is the waters now being invented for children. Zenith have forecasted that the kids\u2019 water category is set to grow even faster than \u201cadult\u201d water. In August, Capri-Sun (owned by Coca-Cola) launched a range of juicy waters; last November, Volvic released its Star Wars collection, including bottles decorated with Chewbacca and Darth Vader; and in May this year, the first ever sparkling water for kids was launched in the US, called Tickle Water. According to Heather McDowell, CEO, Tickle Water was her son\u2019s idea. When he was two, he asked for a sip of her sparkling water, loved it, \u201cand the next day he was like, \u2018Mommy, I want tickle water!\u2019\u201d she told me enthusiastically. Tickle Water comes in a transparent plastic can with an aluminium lid. \u201cSo the kids can feel like they\u2019re drinking a soda because it looks like a soda can, but the parents feel good because they see that it\u2019s clear, plain, transparent water.\u201d For McDowell, if making water look like Coke means kids drink more water and less Coke, this can only be a good thing. True, undoubtedly, but somehow it feels like the final twist in water\u2019s elaborate rebrand, the last stop on a journey that starts with turning on a tap and marvelling that something clean, healthy and potable comes out, and then pauses \u2013 for years \u2013 to watch an iceberg melt very, very slowly, and ends with a child drinking \u201ccola\u201d water (one of Tickle Water\u2019s natural flavours), because he likes the style of the can.

Right now, the global bottled water industry is in one of those strange and energetic boom phases where every week, it seems, a new product finds its way on to the shelves. Not just another bland still or sparkling, but some entirely new definition of the element. It is a case of capitalism at its most hyperactive and brazenly inventive: take a freely available substance, dress it up in countless different costumes and then sell it as something new and capable of transforming body, mind, soul. Water is no longer simply water \u2013 it has become a commercial blank slate, a word on to which any possible ingredient or fantastical, life-enhancing promise can be attached.</p> <p>And it\u2019s working. Over the past two decades, bottled water has become the fastest-growing drinks market in the world. The global market was valued at $157bn in 2013, and is expected to reach $280bn by 2020. Last year, in the UK alone, consumption of water drinks grew by 8.2%, equating to a retail value of more than \u00a32.5bn. Sales of water are 100 times higher than in 1980. Of <em>water</em>: a substance that, in developed countries, can be drunk for free from a tap without fear of contracting cholera.

According to James Salzman, the author of Drinking Water: A History, monks at holy wells produced special water flasks for pilgrims to take away as proof of their visit \u2013 a medieval example of the power of branding. For centuries, wealthy Europeans travelled to spa towns to sample the water in a bid to cure specific ailments. The spa visit was a signal of health, but also of status: somewhere to be seen, an association of liquid and individual that broadcasted social elevation \u2013 a distant precursor to Kim Kardashian clutching a bottle of Fiji, if you like. In 1740, the first commercial British bottled water was launched in Harrogate. By 1914 Harrogate Spring was, according to its website, the largest exporter of bottled water in the country, \u201cproudly keeping the troops hydrated from England to Bombay\u201d.</p> <p>In the early 20th century, however, a water revolution nearly killed the nascent business. After early attempts in Germany and Belgium to chlorinate municipal drinking water, a typhoid epidemic in Lincoln in 1905 prompted the public health crusader Alexander Cruickshank Houston to try out the first extended chlorination of a public water supply. His experiment worked, and soon, chlorination of municipal water had spread around the world. In 1908, Jersey City became the first US city to use full-scale water chlorination, and the practice quickly spread across the country.</p> <p>The bottled water industry almost collapsed as a result. In the past, buying clean water had been a necessity for the rich (the poor simply endured centuries of bad drinking water, and often died from the experience). Now it was freely available to all. Why would you continue to spend money on something that now came, miraculously, out of a tap in your kitchen?</p> <p>The answer arrived in 1977, in the form of what must be one of history\u2019s greatest pieces of television advertising narration. \u201cDeep below the plains of southern France,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qHv4yh4R9c\">rumbled Orson Welles</a> in a voice that sounded as if it were bubbling up from some unreachable subterranean cave, \u201cin a mysterious process begun millions of years ago, Nature herself adds life to the icy waters of a single spring: <em>Perrier</em>.\u201d As viewers watched the water descend into a glass, and admired the glistening green bottle, marketing history was made. The advert was part of a $5m campaign across America \u2013 the largest ever for a bottled water \u2013 and proved a major success. From 1975 to 1978, Perrier sales in the US increased from 2.5m bottles to more than 75m bottles.</p> <p>The Perrier triumph was part of \u201ca perfect confluence\u201d, Salzman told me, of a sudden craze for aerobics in the US, prompted, in part, by Jane Fonda releasing her first exercise video \u2013 Jane Fonda\u2019s Workout, the highest-selling video of all time \u2013 in 1982. There was a new drive not just to be healthy, but to be seen to be healthy. In 1985, Time magazine noted that \u201cwater snobbery has replaced wine snobbery as the latest noon-hour recreation. People order their <em>eau</em> by brand name, as they once did Scotch.\u201d</p> <p>Soon enough, rumours circulated of Madonna bathing in bottled water, and Jack Nicholson was photographed brandishing a bottle of Evian at the Oscars as if it were Cristal. There was also a key practical innovation: in 1977, plastic or PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles were introduced into the soft drink market. By 1990, they were being used for bottled water, making it as convenient and portable as a fizzy drink. The big soft drink brands, spotting the obvious commercial opportunity, soon launched their own waters: PepsiCo\u2019s Aquafina in 1994, Coca-Cola\u2019s Dasani in 1999, and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Pure Life in 2002. Water was back.</p> <p>Water\u2019s glorious renaissance wasn\u2019t just about fashion or convenience. Bottled water can be marked up like no other substance on earth. The \u00a31 that a bottle of water often costs could pay for around 1,000 gallons of tap water. Some waters \u2013 Evian, Perrier, Highland Spring and Harrogate Spring \u2013 come from natural sources, so at least you feel you\u2019re paying for geography, for the fantasy of a shepherd sitting on a rock catching the icy flow in a glass jar specifically for your pleasure. But plenty of bottled waters are simply refashioned tap water.</p> <p>In February 2004, Coca-Cola attempted to launch Dasani in the UK. (\u201cDasani\u201d, by the way, means nothing.) Five weeks later, the company took all 500,000 bottles off the shelves after headlines such as the Daily Star\u2019s \u201cAre They Taking Us For Plonkers!\u201d Coca-Cola had followed its successful strategy in the US and purified tap water, added some mineral salts, and was selling it for 95p a bottle. The company hadn\u2019t, however, accounted for Britain\u2019s long memory for sitcom storylines \u2013 in this case, the episode of Only Fools and Horses when Del Boy and Rodney bottle tap water in their flat and sell it as Peckham Spring. Then there was the issue of a batch of minerals contaminating Dasani with a possibly carcinogenic bromate. In a little more than a month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/apr/18/foodanddrink\">Dasani was dead</a>.</p> <p>Ten years later, Coca-Cola launched a new bottled water in the UK. In the intervening decade, the industry, after a brief dip following the 2008 financial crash, had entered its hyperactive new phase. Vita Coco \u2013 one of the first of the \u201cnew\u201d waters \u2013 came to the UK in 2009, and in its wake soon appeared a flotilla of further <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/27/is-it-worth-it-coconut-water\">coconut waters</a> (the coconut water market is now worth \u00a3100m in the UK).</p> <p>The industry received a further boost this year from the former chancellor George Osborne, who announced a sugar tax on soft drinks in his final budget. As the \u201cplain\u201d bottled water market continued to expand, new inventions began to spring up. \u201cStrong established growth leads to offshoots,\u201d explained Richard Hall, chairman of Zenith International, a market research company that organises the annual and thrillingly named <a href=\"http://www.zenithinternational.com/events/205/13th%20Global%20Bottled%20Water%20Congress\">Global Bottled Water Congress</a>. Water had begun its reinvention: enter maple, birch, energy and even ocean.</p> <p>Coca-Cola\u2019s new water is called Glac\u00e9au Smartwater. The water, which comes from a spring in Morpeth, Northumberland, is \u201cvapour distilled\u201d, then injected with electrolytes. In other words, the water is evaporated and then condensed again, a process Coca-Cola describes as being \u201cinspired by the clouds\u201d.</p> <p>Ten years ago, this, surely, would have got the Peckham Spring treatment from the media. But we live in new times. Glac\u00e9au Smartwater is now worth \u00a321.9m, and, earlier this year, Coca-Cola announced an investment of \u00a315m to expand the factory where it is produced. At present, it turns out 56,000 bottles of water per hour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"79f6d67abf043635d0794b0e46dd0f65e1b3b5d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79f6d67abf043635d0794b0e46dd0f65e1b3b5d7/0_0_5016_3010/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It is no longer enough for water to simply be water: it must have special powers\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It is no longer enough for water to simply be water: it must have special powers\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Washburn/Getty Images/fStop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>If the last decade witnessed water\u2019s great commercial expansion, 2016 could perhaps be defined as the year the market lost its mind. There now seems to be no limit on what a water can be, or what consumers are willing to buy. It is no longer enough for water to simply be water: it must have special powers.</p> <p>This summer alone saw the launch of Fl\u00f5 Essence Water, Omega Enhanced Health Water, BiPro Protein Water and Svalbar\u00f0i polar iceberg water. Other recent additions include blk. water (black water), FATwater (water containing \u201cquality fat\u201d) and deep ocean water harvested from off the coast of Hawaii (which allegedly hydrates you twice as fast as \u201cnormal\u201d water). In July, the Evening Standard ran an article that only semi-ironically described water as a \u201csuperdrink\u201d.</p> <p>Powering this proliferation of new brands is a new breed of start-upper: the water entrepreneur. I met one such man \u2013 a 27-year-old named Rahi Daneshmand \u2013 in Planet Organic on that hot August day, doling out samples of his new product, Virtue Energy Water. Virtue offers, in a 250ml can (\u00a31.35), a sugar-free sparkling water that contains \u201cyerba mat\u00e9\u201d, ginseng, citric acid, guarana and natural fruit flavours<strong>, </strong>and offers a \u201cnatural\u201d caffeine hit equivalent to a cup of coffee. It comes in two flavours, berries and lemon and lime. The response from the clientele was varied: \u201cMore fun than normal water!\u201d said one woman, taking a sip. \u201cIt\u2019s not too sweet,\u201d approved another. \u201cI\u2019m trying to avoid sweetness.\u201d Some were a little bemused. \u201cNatural caffeine? What\u2019s that?\u201d asked a younger customer. \u201cIs it for the 3pm slump or after clubbing? What\u2019s it <em>for</em>?\u201d</p> <p>Virtue is Daneshmand\u2019s big idea. In fact, it\u2019s his second big idea \u2013 after Virtue Iced Tea, which did quite well (it\u2019s stocked on Ocado). In his mind, iced tea has now been surpassed by the great hope of his new creation,<strong> </strong>which he claims is Britain\u2019s first ever naturally sugar-free energy water. Daneshmand is a committed, joyous entrepreneur. After a few childhood years in Iran, he moved back to England with his family, went to Newcastle University, and somewhere along the way picked up the look and accent of an indefatigably cheerful rugby player. He wears polo shirts, lives by mantras \u2013 \u201cnothing in life is worth getting stressed about\u201d \u2013 and is the kind of hyper-motivated person who reads two business books in a weekend. (In mid-August: Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organisation and Ego is the Enemy.)</p> <p>Daneshmand says he went into water because he wanted to make something pure. \u201cWater is something that everyone needs and something that everyone drinks,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe went with the term water because it has zero sugar.\u201d</p> <p>This, he pointed out, is not always the case. Many of the so-called \u201cwaters\u201d crowding the market are jammed with sugar. Coca-Cola\u2019s Glac\u00e9au Vitaminwater (\u201cvitamins. electrolytes. unstoppableness\u201d) used to contain 23g of sugar, until the public outcry forced the company to start swapping sugar for the sweetener stevia. (Then there was a subsequent outcry about the new taste, so it swapped back.)</p> <p>\u201cPeople are just trying to put water into everything,\u201d said Daneshmand, shaking his head. His water, from the mains supply, is subject to \u201cultra-filtration and reverse osmosis\u201d to remove minerals and make it \u201cclean\u201d. Its added ingredients are entirely natural. On this point, Daneshmand is evangelical: \u201cThat\u2019s what a water is and what a water should always be.\u201d</p> <p>One afternoon this summer, I watched Daneshmand pitch his water to Rahil Vora, managing director of the health food chain Revital. Things seemed to be going well. It was a fiercely hot day, which made any cold liquid seem appealing, and there was the happy synchrony that both Virtue and Revital had incorporated a leaf into their logo. Moreover, Vora was buying into the concept. \u201cI like the fact that it\u2019s an energy \u2018water\u2019 rather than an energy \u2018drink\u2019,\u201d he said. He liked the can, too \u2013 more environmentally friendly than a plastic bottle \u2013 and the natural ingredients, yerba mate in particular.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/2015/jul/09/where-does-your-bottled-water-come-from-in-pictures\">Where your favourite bottled water comes from \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou know about it?\u201d said Daneshmand, almost disappointed. \u201cIn south America they drink it religiously \u2013 it\u2019s their equivalent of tea.\u201d</p> <p>Vora didn\u2019t need schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s going to pick up as a trend,\u201d he said. \u201cGive it a year and you\u2019ll see it become not quite as big as green tea but \u2026 it\u2019s one of those ingredients.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Daneshmand. \u201cWe put the accent on the mat\u00e9 as I think people were reading it as yerba mate.\u201d</p> <p>New water samples were arriving on Vora\u2019s desk every week. \u201cIt\u2019s a fashion thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWater in a can was the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Water in a can? \u201cLiterally. I got sent a box of samples. And it was just water. In a can.\u201d</p> <p>Vora shook his head in disbelief. No yerba mate, no aloe, nothing \u2013 330ml for 99p. Vora paused. \u201cFor <em>water</em>, though.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Water in a can, it turned out, was CanO water, launched by three young British entrepreneurs in January this year. I went to see them in their office in Stanmore, north London \u2013 one room, laptops, a mini basketball hoop on the wall. Ariel Booker, 24, and Perry Fielding, 29, sat opposite each other. (Their third cofounder, Josh White, was away.) Business was going well.</p> <p>Before they had formally launched, CanO had secured the right to supply London Fashion Week and a purchase order from Selfridges, which has banned all plastic bottles from its store as part of its environmental programme, Project Ocean.<strong> </strong>(CanO also managed to land a celebrity endorsement on Instagram from the model David Gandy: \u201cNo excuses not to be hydrated this summer\u201d.) By March, CanO was stocked in Whole Foods.</p> <p>I mentioned Vora\u2019s bewilderment at their product. \u201cWe have this problem on the phone,\u201d said Booker, the fast-talker, in a monochrome printed shirt and silver bracelet. \u201cWithout seeing it, it can be a bit mind-boggling! Why? What? How? When?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople just think of it as a Coke can filled with water,\u201d said Fielding, the creative, a sun tattoo on his arm and silver chain around his neck. \u201cIt seems very unexciting when you think of it like that.\u201d</p> <p>Everything changes, they believe, when you see CanO. The water, which comes from the foothills of the Austrian alps, is packaged in a minimalist black (sparkling) or white (still) can. \u201cThe visual aspect dictates everything we do,\u201d said Fielding. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just a product or a company or a drink, it\u2019s actually an aspirational brand that you\u2019d want to buy into.\u201d On the brand\u2019s Instagram feed, the cans pose sexily next to MacBook Airs, old-fashioned cameras, swimming pools and YSL handbags. Water just happens to be the thing inside.</p> <p>Fielding had the eureka moment last year while drinking a canned fizzy drink. \u201cIt just dawned on me, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great to be able to drink water out of a <em>can</em>?\u2019\u201d The can, made of aluminium, is easily recyclable and has a resealable lid \u2013 a piece of German design that means you can put the can back in your bag without worrying about it leaking.</p> <p>\u201cI think some people look at this and think it\u2019s a gimmick,\u201d said Fielding. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve packaged it nicely doesn\u2019t actually make it a gimmick.\u201d</p> <p>The brand name, meanwhile, was their second choice. Fielding originally wanted to call the product \u201cWater\u201d, but lawyers informed him that you couldn\u2019t trademark the word that simply described the contents of the can.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4515a56908457e5888661c594714a6875cc9d5c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4515a56908457e5888661c594714a6875cc9d5c2/0_0_5016_3010/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Even those in the bottled water industry find some of the newer arrivals perplexing.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Even those in the bottled water industry find some of the newer arrivals perplexing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Washburn/Getty Images/fStop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The arrival of plain water in a pretty German-engineered can feels like some kind of apex, where the market\u2019s relentless demand for novelty has pushed a basic substance to its limit. We are surely only a small step from the unquestioned purchasing of emotions or air. (This, inevitably, is already happening: as Andrea Leadsom excitedly pointed out in her recent Tory party conference speech, a young British entrepreneur, Leo de Watts, now sells glass jars of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Welsh or Yorkshire air for \u00a380 each, mostly to the Chinese.)</p> <p>Even those in the bottled water industry find some of the newer arrivals perplexing. Everyone has their pet farce. For Ariel Booker of CanO, it was black water: \u201cWhat is the need to have water that\u2019s black?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is none.\u201d For Daneshmand, it was Rockstar, an American \u201cenergy water\u201d brand that had the same sugar volume as Red Bull (9g per 100ml). \u201cAbsolutely <em>mad</em>, that was.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Riese, whose website describes him as \u201cthe world\u2019s foremost expert on water\u201d, directs his disdain at Glac\u00e9au Smartwater: \u201cSorry, Smartwater, but you are not a premium product,\u201d he told me in his thick German accent. \u201cYou are a highly processed product and your water belongs in the trash can, nowhere else!\u201d For Riese, a purist, \u201cbottled water has to come from nature\u201d. Any kind of processing is, he believes, \u201cthe biggest scam on planet Earth!\u201d</p> <p>Riese really, really loves water. \u201cIt started for me as a very small child,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was four years old, on vacation with my parents, and I was blown away by the fact that the tap water in the city tasted differently.\u201d After school, he started working in restaurants in Germany, put together what was possibly the world\u2019s first water menu in 2005 for a Berlin bistro, and wrote a book: Die Welt des Wassers (The World of Waters). \u201cIt\u2019s a German book, so you\u2019ll have to learn to read German to read it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A bottle from the Luxury Collection Diamond Edition costs $100,000. It has a white gold cap set with over 850 diamonds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the years, Riese has become part of water history. After receiving his certificate as a mineral water sommelier from the German Mineral Water Trade Association, he moved to America in 2010 and became that country\u2019s first water sommelier. In 2013, he launched the longest water menu in Los Angeles at Ray\u2019s and Stark Bar, and cofounded his own brand of mineral water: Beverly Hills 90H20.</p> <p>This self-proclaimed \u201cchampagne of waters\u201d quickly won FoodBev Media\u2019s Beverage Innovation award for the \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Still or Sparkling Water\u201d. A case of 24 500ml bottles is $72, while a bottle from the \u201cLuxury Collection, Diamond Edition\u201d will cost you $100,000. It has a white gold cap set with more than 850 white and black diamonds and holds the profoundly questionable honour of being the world\u2019s most expensive bottle of water. If you buy it, Riese will present the bottle to you in person at a private water tasting anywhere in the world.</p> <p>At present, Riese sommeliers at Patina, a restaurant in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. There, he guides the diners through his water menu, helping them to select the ideal water to accompany their meal.</p> <p>Riese talked me through his technique.</p> <p>First: \u201cDo you prefer sparkling or flat?\u201d</p> <p>Then: \u201cDo you prefer your bubbles a little bit more progressive, like very intense, or do you like your bubbles a little bit on the smaller side, like champagne bubbles, very tiny?\u201d</p> <p>Finally: \u201cDo you prefer something on the high mineral end, on the salty and bitter side, or do you prefer something on the smoother side, with a lower mineral composition, like maybe a little bit on the fruitier side?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople will tell you right away, then, what they want,\u201d said Riese. Perhaps the clientele at the Patina restaurant are better versed in the mineral composition and fruity or salty aspects of water than the rest of us. At a basic level, the taste of water varies according to the total dissolved solids (TDS) it contains. These solids can be any substance, but the key elements are sodium, magnesium and calcium. Any filtered or chemically treated tap water will usually contain fewer solids than a bottled water that still carries the minerals from the water\u2019s source, be it glacial, maple sap or spring.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/nov/04/water.g2\">Fiji water</a>, for example, contains 210mg/L TDS, including 18mg/L sodium, 13mg/L magnesium and 18mg/L calcium. (Fiji appears to have pulled off some fairly heavy-duty trademarking, including \u201cUntouched by man\u2122\u201d and \u201cEarth\u2019s finest water\u2122\u201d.) Compare those numbers to San Pellegrino, which contains quadruple the TDS, at 925mg/L, including 33.6mg/L sodium, 53.8mg/L magnesium and 178mg/L calcium. Fiji, with far fewer solids, tastes smoother, while the San Pellegrino is bolder, saltier and naturally fizzy.</p> <p>Nothing, however, compares to Riese\u2019s favourite water, the Slovenian spring water Roi. \u201cI\u2019m always calling it the Big Boy,\u201d said Riese. Roi has a TDS of 7,400mg/L, including more than 1,000mg/L of magnesium. For Riese, the experience of drinking this water is extraordinary, and emotional. He sits with a glass on its own \u2013 no mixer, no food, no distraction \u2013 as if he\u2019s drinking a rare cognac. \u201cThis is something very, <em>very</em> special.\u201d</p> <p>Riese knows how his obsession with water might be perceived. \u201cSome people think I\u2019m the biggest scam artist,\u201d he told me. He believes that he is simply applying the principle of wine to water \u2013<em> </em>terroir. The taste of natural water, just like wine, is affected by geography, earth, the rock it passes through. And Roi is the ultimate example: \u201cIt has way more electrolytes than Gatorade,\u201d Riese said, his voice climbing in ecstasy. \u201cThink about it! Way more electrolytes than Gatorade! But it\u2019s from Mother Nature!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Take an investigation into the bottled water industry to its logical conclusion and you find yourself drinking melted icebergs. Last year, the Merchant hotel in Belfast launched its water menu to a global chorus of tabloid mockery. \u201cWould you pay \u00a326 for a bottle of water (even if it IS from a Canadian glacier)?\u201d ran the Daily Mail headline. Gavin Carroll, the Merchant\u2019s general manager, gave the whole episode its only possible name: Watergate. When I visited this summer to sample the menu, he still seemed a little puzzled by the reaction. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Really? It\u2019s just water.\u2019\u201d For \u00a326? \u201cWe\u2019re a five-star hotel. We have to offer our customers choice.\u201d</p> <p>The Merchant\u2019s executive chef, and the chief architect of the water menu, Patrick Leonard \u2013 a man so passionate about water that before every sip I took, I could sense him shuffling to the edge of his seat in anticipation \u2013 brought out the notorious \u00a326 bottle, called Iceberg. The water comes from the Canadian Arctic ice shelf in Newfoundland, frozen around 10,000 years ago. \u201cThey\u2019re not allowed to remove parts of icebergs,\u201d said Leonard, \u201cso they have to wait until they separate. They detach naturally, and then they\u2019re netted, brought on a boat to land and allowed to melt.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a beautiful thing, this bottle \u2013 more like a premium vodka bottle, made of thick glass, decorated with white snowflakes. Leonard poured a portion of the ancient iceberg into a tumbler. The pressure mounted; I was painfully aware that the glass of water in front of me was worth a tenner, and I still had my bottle of airport-purchased Boots\u2019 own brand on the table. I sipped, swallowed, felt the passage of liquid down my oesophagus \u2013 and couldn\u2019t taste anything at all. This was not a total failure of my unsophisticated palate. Melted iceberg essentially has no taste, having the lowest TDS (9mg/L) of any water on earth. It is like the ur-water, the water that pre-dates all other waters. \u201cThis is your starting point,\u201d said Leonard, gravely. \u201cYour baseline.\u201d</p> <p>We moved on to Whitehole Springs, a Somerset-sourced, calcium-rich still water that passes through Tufa rock; Vichy Catalan, a salty Spanish sparkler; and finally De L\u2019Aubier Sap Water, from Canada, a byproduct of the maple syrup manufacturing process.<strong> </strong>Along the way, Leonard explained the origin of his water preoccupation: a radio interview he heard with \u2013 who else? \u2013 Martin Riese: \u201cIt just got me hooked; that was it.\u201d For a chef already infatuated by taste, water was the natural extension. \u201cWe pay so much attention to food and wine, but we forget about the water,\u201d he said. His favourite? Vichy Catalan. \u201cI just had friends for dinner, and instead of bringing out the wine, I brought out three bottles of that.\u201d He looked absolutely delighted. \u201cIt was so much fun!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to maintain cynicism in the face of a true enthusiast. Leonard loves water so much he has water parties. This is not to be mocked. And, I\u2019ll admit it, tasting this quartet of waters taught its own lesson. Pay attention, as with anything, and you notice more, appreciate more. These waters tasted dramatically different from each other, had their own peculiarities and characteristics. The maple sap water was sweet, earthy; Whitehole Springs thicker and chalky. And after the featureless purity of the melted iceberg, the Vichy Catalan was like snorting peppercorns.</p> <p>Of course, there is <a href=\"http://www.icebergwatereurope.com/home/#harvesting\">something deranged about the idea</a> of netting an iceberg and waiting for it to melt \u2013 apparently, applying heat would ruin the taste. There is also something disturbing about paying nearly \u00a330 for the experience of drinking the end result. But, for the connoisseur, all of this makes as much sense as buying a vintage claret instead of Jacob\u2019s Creek, a fillet steak instead of a Peperami. Passion has no limit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"5334bc172f03a0a4bf9ceb8f39518ac11e011ce4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5334bc172f03a0a4bf9ceb8f39518ac11e011ce4/0_0_7130_4278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There is something deranged about the idea of netting an iceberg and waiting years for it to melt.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is something deranged about the idea of netting an iceberg and waiting years for it to melt.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Washburn/Getty Images/fStop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>At some point, surely, we will reach \u201cpeak\u201d water. Perhaps it will be the moment consumers lose faith in the cellulite-eradicating powers of Buddha water or wonder if it\u2019s really worth paying over the odds for birch sap<strong>.</strong> You hope for cold logic to kick in, some sort of mass awakening to this lunatic capitalist experiment. What are we even looking for, in all these waters? The same thing, perhaps, that we are hoping to find when we buy quinoa crisps, or gluten-free seed bars: perfect health, moral relief, a sense of inner purity that somehow erases all the wine we drank last night. We want to be better people.</p> <p>The peak, however, is not in sight: for now, experts can only see growth steadily increasing in the bottled water market, at 5-6% across the industry over the next five years, according to Zenith\u2019s Richard Hall. The water entrepreneurs are yet to run out of ideas. There are waters that haven\u2019t even been thought of yet, niches still to be fully explored. Minor brands \u2013 the endless coconut waters \u2013 will fall away over time, said the water historian James Salzman, and \u201cyou\u2019ll be left with those who have survived, who will be purchased by the major players\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The water entrepreneurs are yet to run out of ideas. There are waters that haven\u2019t even been thought of yet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the young entrepreneurs, like CanO and Virtue, the future is about staying in the game, making a product that a consumer didn\u2019t even know they needed six months ago, but that now inhabits their fridge door with the permanence of ketchup. In early autumn, things were going well \u2013 both Revital and Holland &amp; Barrett had ordered Virtue for their shops and Daneshmand had meetings set up with two of the four largest supermarket chains (he was too coy to name them). CanO, meanwhile, had shipped its first orders to China, Germany and Thailand.</p> <p>If there is a final frontier of water, then perhaps it is the waters now being invented for children. Zenith have forecasted that the kids\u2019 water category is set to grow even faster than \u201cadult\u201d water. In August, Capri-Sun (owned by Coca-Cola) launched a range of juicy waters; last November, Volvic released its Star Wars collection, including bottles decorated with Chewbacca and Darth Vader; and in May this year, the first ever sparkling water for kids was launched in the US, called Tickle Water.</p> <p>According to Heather McDowell, CEO, Tickle Water was her son\u2019s idea. When he was two, he asked for a sip of her sparkling water, loved it, \u201cand the next day he was like, \u2018Mommy, I want tickle water!\u2019\u201d she told me enthusiastically. Tickle Water comes in a transparent plastic can with an aluminium lid. \u201cSo the kids can feel like they\u2019re drinking a soda because it looks like a soda can, but the parents feel good because they see that it\u2019s clear, plain, transparent water.\u201d</p> <p>For McDowell, if making water look like Coke means kids drink more water and less Coke, this can only be a good thing. True, undoubtedly, but somehow it feels like the final twist in water\u2019s elaborate rebrand, the last stop on a journey that starts with turning on a tap and marvelling that something clean, healthy and potable comes out, and then pauses \u2013 for years \u2013 to watch an iceberg melt very, very slowly, and ends with a child drinking \u201ccola\u201d water (one of Tickle Water\u2019s natural flavours), because he likes the style of the can.</p> <p>From element to commodity, we finally got there: welcome to the age of Water\u2122. </p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 7 October and 8 November 2016.

      "bodyText": "A self-described \u201cbattler\u201d from Sydney has had the cost of his Domino\u2019s Pizza order refunded after 18 months and a successful court battle. Tim Driscoll, a lawyer from Corrimal, placed an order to be delivered by the chain for his Anzac Day celebrations with friends in April 2015. When the order was not delivered, the manager of the branch apologised to Driscoll and promised him a refund. Despite frequent reminders from Drioscoll he did not receive the refund and repeated attempts to contact the Domino\u2019s Pizza board were also unsuccessful even though he was a shareholder in the company. The 2015 pizza order \u2013 three pizzas, two garlic breads and two 1.25L Cokes \u2013 had cost $37.35, including a public holiday surcharge. On the 12-month anniversary of the failed Domino\u2019s order he decided he had \u201cbetter go and initiate proceedings\u201d, as he told 3AW Radio on Thursday. Driscoll \u2013 who specialises in personal injury and workers\u2019 compensation claims \u2013 sued Domino\u2019s for breach of contract. The matter was heard in court on Wednesday, reported the Daily Telegraph. When Domino\u2019s Pizza did not acknowledge or participate in the proceedings, Driscoll was awarded the case by default, with the chain ordered to pay $1,203.27 to cover his legal fees as well as the $37.35 order. Driscroll told 3AW that he had not yet received the payment from Domino\u2019s Pizza. \u201cThey\u2019ve not responded at all, even though I\u2019ve sent the order to them a couple of times.\u201d He rejected the company\u2019s assertion that it was not aware of the proceedings. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve kept them apprised at every step.\u201d In a statement to Guardian Australia, a spokesman said Domino\u2019s was \u201cdisappointed and embarrassed to hear that we have let down a pizza-loving customer [Driscoll]\u201d. He said that Driscoll had been provided with free pizza vouchers at the time of the 2015 incident \u201cbut we clearly could have and should have done more\u201d. He said that Domino\u2019s had \u201clet [Driscoll] down\u201d and was \u201cworking to make it up to him\u201d. Domino\u2019s had been in touch with Driscoll on Thursday morning and was \u201cworking to make it up to him ... and to ensure he is not out of pocket for any expenses incurred\u201d. That included making the court-ordered payment, the spokesman said, adding that a complimentary lunch order had been sent to Driscoll\u2019s workplace in Sydney. Driscoll told 3AW that he had pursued the matter on principle. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be taken lightly, I suppose, in any of these kinds of matters. ... It was a bit embarrassing having my friends there and no food to give them, so it was a bit of a personal insult,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cI just kept fighting. I\u2019ve always been a battler.\u201d He remains a shareholder in the company \u201cat the moment\u201d, he told 3AW.",
