      "bodyText": "Labour called for the former chief executive of Rolls-Royce to lose his knighthood, after the company admitted \u201cextensive systemic bribery and corruption\u201d during the period in which he ran the jet engines manufacturer. Sir John Rose held the job at the Derby-based corporation, which was forced on Tuesday to admit that it was responsible for \u201cegregious criminality over decades\u201d between 1996 and 2011. Barry Gardiner, the shadow secretary of state for international trade, said Rose could not credibly retain his knighthood in light of the company\u2019s conduct during his term as chief executive. \u201cIf Sir John Rose was the controlling mind in the company at the time, and was aware of these allegations, then he is not fit to hold his knighthood,\u201d he said. \u201cIf in fact he was the chief executive of a company in which there was widespread corrupt practices going on, and he was unaware of that, then one has to ask whether he was fit to hold office as chief executive.\u201d \u201cGiven that it is for services to the industry as chief executive that he was knighted, again it comes back to him not being fit to hold his knighthood. So I cannot see in either way that he can credibly retain his honour.\u201d The call came as Rolls-Royce also admitted in a deal with US prosecutors, that it had made corrupt payments worth more than $35m (\u00a328.47m) in a further five countries between 2000 and 2013. The engineering giant had already apologised on Tuesday after UK prosecutors established that it had acted corruptly in seven countries. The UK settlement was ratified in the high court in a deferred prosecution agreement, whereby the company would pay a fine but escape prosecution. At the hearing, presiding judge Sir Brian Leveson said: \u201cI am satisfied that both the senior management and those responsible for the strategic direction of Rolls-Royce are different to those responsible for the running of the company (and its culture) during the period when the events which I have described occurred.\u201d Leveson also found that an internal report into overseas bribery and corruption had been compiled in 2010 but that the company decided not to report the illegal activity to the authorities. As part of the global settlement process, Rolls-Royce stated that it had completely changed its senior management since uncovering the corruption. Gardiner added that the regulators should ensure that all the individuals involved in corruption and bribery at Rolls-Royce should be held to account. The manufacturing multinational has been hit with the biggest criminal penalty in British history after being ordered to pay \u00a3671m in fines. On Monday the company announced the settlement with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), after accepting that its defence and civil aerospace divisions had paid bribes and corrupted officials and politicians around the world. Rolls-Royce has insisted that no member of senior management was involved in the criminal activities, after a series of resignations. \u201cThe company we now look at in terms of its senior management is a different beast,\u201d said SFO\u2019s barrister Sir Edward Garnier told the high court on Tuesday. Rose declined to comment. Under Rose\u2019s management Rolls-Royce\u2019s profits rose more than fivefold, and he was widely praised as a captain of industry upon stepping down in 2011. Vince Cable, the then-business secretary, praised him as \u201ca tremendous business leader\u201d. On Tuesday, details of the additional offences emerged after the US Department of Justice published its own deferred prosecution agreement with Rolls-Royce concerning its energy division. The UK settlement only covered bribery in the defence and civil aerospace sectors. The DoJ said prosecutions of Rolls-Royce employees involved in corruption remained possible. A spokesperson said: \u201cThis remains an ongoing investigation, and a corporate resolution has no bearing on whether charges are brought against individuals.\u201d The SFO is still investigating the possibility of prosecuting individuals in the UK. In the US settlement, which did not name the middlemen used to pay bribes, Rolls-Royce admitted that: In Thailand, its employees hired intermediaries to help it secure contracts with PTT, the state-owned energy company. In one instance an employee and senior executive discussed how a large payment would be disguised in the company\u2019s accounting software. More than $11m of corrupt payments were made over 10 years. In Brazil, Rolls-Royce hired an intermediary who bribed a senior official at the scandal-ridden state oil and gas company Petrobras. The intermediary was paid almost $10m, of which $1.6m was paid to a corrupt official. In Kazakhstan, Rolls-Royce hired three different intermediaries knowing they would pay bribes to help the company secure contracts supplying components to a China-Kazakhstan gas pipeline that was under construction. Staff used personal email accounts and code names and deleted incriminating emails to hide the corruption. In Azerbaijan, almost $8m in corrupt payments were made to an intermediary between 2000 and 2009, securing profits worth over $50m in contracts with the state-owned oil and gas company Socar. In Iraq, an intermediary began bribing officials in Iraq\u2019s state-owned Southern Oil Company in 2006 in exchange for confidential information, and later to stop Rolls-Royce being blacklisted after concerns were raised about turbines they had supplied. In Angola, Rolls-Royce hired an intermediary despite knowing there was a high probability that bribes would be paid to foreign officials to secure contracts. $2.4m of corrupt commission payments helped the company secure almost $30m of profits between 2008 and 2012. Former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin lost his knighthood in 2012 after being heavily criticised over his role in the bank\u2019s near-collapse in 2008. Before Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood, only convicted criminals or people struck off professional bodies had lost knighthoods. Questions have also been raised about Sir Philip Green\u2019s knighthood, after the collapse of the BHS chain of shops. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 January 2017. An earlier version gave a figure of \u00a3691m where \u00a3671m was meant.",

      "bodyText": "Forecasting is difficult, especially about the future, as the old line goes \u2013 but is it quite as hard as John Fallon, chief executive of Pearson, makes it seem? Two errors in 2016 were understandable, or at least not unique. Most big US educational publishers were too optimistic about the numbers of students enrolling in US colleges and the number of students who would opt to rent, rather than buy, their textbooks. Trickier to explain, however, is Fallon\u2019s relative confidence only three months ago. Last October, when revenues from higher education courseware material were running at minus 13% at the nine-month stage, Pearson spoke of \u201cimproving trends\u201d. In the event, revenues plunged 30% in the final quarter of the year. \u201cWe now assume that many of these downward pressures will continue,\u201d warned Wednesday\u2019s statement meekly. Profits for 2016 will still hit the \u00a3630m target but 2017 could see a decline. More significantly, the important target of \u00a3800m for 2018 has been abandoned, or \u201cwithdrawn\u201d in the cute phrasing. Another ambition was to keep paying dividends, at least at the old rate. That, too, has been ditched. Against those upsets and a 29% fall in the share price, the proposed sale of Pearson\u2019s 47% stake in Penguin Random House was almost a side-story for shareholders. The entire educational market in the US, on which Pearson staked its future a decade ago, has been blasted from many directions. An \u201cunprecedented period of change and volatility\u201d \u2013 Fallon\u2019s description \u2013 is accurate, but the question is whether Pearson adapted fast enough in the print-to-digital revolution. Back in February 2014, a year into the job, Fallon reckoned Pearson was \u201cin the middle of what we believe will be a short, but difficult, transition\u201d. Three years later, the transition is having to become faster. Pearson will cut ebook rental prices by up to 50% on 2,000 titles and invest an extra \u00a350m at improving its digital capabilities. Fallon offered a spirited defence that, when the dust settles, the digital future in education will be stable, reliable and \u201cat least as profitable\u201d as the analogue past. The theory runs that educational publishing in the US is not like the newspaper business: prices for digital content, complete with tailored material and self-assessment features, might be lower but old-style printed textbooks will no longer pass through six hands. Will Fallon still be at Pearson to see his prophecy fulfilled or not? One doubts it. The share price has halved on his watch and chief executives tend not to survive five profits warnings in four years. Sidney Taurel, the chairman, is new-ish and thus hard to read \u2013 but Fallon should probably prepare for a short but difficult conversation. Deutsche Bank surrenders bonuses after nightmare year It should not be noteworthy that a bank that isn\u2019t paying a dividend to its shareholders, is forking out $7.2bn in fines to US regulators and is cutting thousands of jobs, has also decided that its senior employees can live without their usual bonuses for a year. Deutsche Bank\u2019s common-sense policy counts as interesting, however. Think back to Barclays in 2014. The bank wasn\u2019t in quite as deep a pickle as today\u2019s Deutsche, but profits had just fallen by a third and Barclays was in the scandalous position of distributing three times as much in bonuses as in shareholders\u2019 dividends. Chief executive Antony Jenkins explained he felt compelled to pay the big bucks to prevent a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of defections. Jenkins\u2019 pusillanimous decision didn\u2019t work to his advantage \u2013 he was dismissed the following year. Deutsche\u2019s John Cryan isn\u2019t being wholly pure in cancelling individual bonuses for the top 25% of staff. He will still spray a few long-term incentives on \u201ca limited number of employees in crucial positions\u201d. But his approach is miles away from Barclays\u2019 in 2014, suggesting the death-spiral is more of a gentle slope that a self-respecting bank ought to be able to confront. How much did Rolls-Royce\u2019s executives know about its criminal dealings? A senior high court judge called Rolls-Royce\u2019s conduct, for which it will pay \u00a3671m in penalties, \u201cegregious criminality over decades\u201d. Sir Brian Leveson also said Rolls-Royce had known about potential corruption in 2010 but decided not to notify the Serious Fraud Office. A report was supplied only after the company, under different leadership, started its own investigations in 2013. So what \u2013 if anything \u2013 were the non-executive directors told at the time? Did they know about the 2010 report? Iain Conn, these days chief executive of Centrica, was Rolls-Royce\u2019s senior independent director in 2010. Asked in Davos (where else?) by the Guardian about what he was told, he said on Wednesday: \u201cI\u2019m not an officer of the company. I can\u2019t speak for the company. You\u2019ll have to ask them.\u201d Really? Surely it is reasonable for shareholders, who ultimately will pay the heavy bill, and outsiders to expect former members of the board to speak for themselves.",

He will still spray a few long-term incentives on \u201ca limited number of employees in crucial positions\u201d. But his approach is miles away from Barclays\u2019 in 2014, suggesting the death-spiral is more of a gentle slope that a self-respecting bank ought to be able to confront.</p> <h2> <strong>How much did Rolls-Royce\u2019s executives know about its criminal dealings?</strong></h2> <p>A senior high court judge called Rolls-Royce\u2019s conduct, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/17/rolls-royce-apologises-bribery-671m-uk-us-brazil\">for which it will pay \u00a3671m in penalties</a>, \u201cegregious criminality over decades\u201d. Sir Brian Leveson also said Rolls-Royce had known about potential corruption in 2010 but decided not to notify the Serious Fraud Office. A report was supplied only after the company, under different leadership, started its own investigations in 2013.</p> <p>So what \u2013 if anything \u2013 were the non-executive directors told at the time? Did they know about the 2010 report?</p> <p>Iain Conn, these days chief executive of Centrica, was Rolls-Royce\u2019s senior independent director in 2010. Asked in Davos (where else?) by the Guardian about what he was told, he said on Wednesday: \u201cI\u2019m not an officer of the company. I can\u2019t speak for the company. You\u2019ll have to ask them.\u201d </p> <p>Really? Surely it is reasonable for shareholders, who ultimately will pay the heavy bill, and outsiders to expect former members of the board to speak for themselves.</p>",

The corrosive role of tax havens in facilitating tax avoidance is not something to be emulated.

Charlie Matthews Head of Advocacy, ActionAid UK \u2022 Theresa May\u2019s negotiating stance, with its no-so-veiled threat to turn Britain into an offshore, low regulation tax haven, resembles nothing more than the person holding a gun to their head, shouting: \u201cIf I don\u2019t get my way I\u2019ll pull the trigger!\u201d Dr Richard Carter London \u2022 Philip Hammond has suggested that the UK could transform its economic model into that of a corporate tax haven if the EU fails to provide it with an agreement on market access.

Currently in the EU, the effective corporate tax rate in the likes of Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ireland, Hungary, Malta and Romania are lower than the UK\u2019s rate of 19% (which is set to be lowered to 18% in 2020). Any member state is free to unilaterally change their corporate tax policy at any time.

      "bodyText": "The official Davos sessions are now over for the day, although there are plenty of working dinners taking place (most off the record, alas). In the hall, it\u2019s Dalian Night - with trays of delicious Chinese food* for the throng, washed down with wine or Tsingtao beer. *stir-fried beef, cabbage and celery, oodles of noodles, with Lychees and Tapioka-coconut pudding and mango to follow. So that\u2019s all from us for today, unless any major news breaks out. Back tomorrow for Theresa May\u2019s special address to Davos, and a lot more.... GW It wouldn\u2019t be Davos without a dose of eurozone angst; and Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, has provided it. Dimon told Bloomberg TV tonight that the euro area could break up unless politicians address the populist anger that has built up. He said: \u201cWhat went wrong is going wrong for everybody, not just going wrong for Britain, but in some ways it looks like they\u2019re kind of doubling down. [Unless leaders address underlying concerns] you\u2019re going to have the same political things about immigration, the laws of the country, how much power goes to Brussels.\u201d The United States may flip at the end of this week from being a climate leader, to being the leading climate change denier, says Thomas Friedman, the author chairing the climate change session. How will Trump\u2019s election, and the changes in Europe, affect the climate agenda? Norway\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, is optimistic that Brexit won\u2019t change the climate agenda I believe the Brits are going to continue being active on this, and that my sister party the Conservatives will hold firm to an agenda against emissions. But the United States could be a different story once Trump is in charge. The Paris Agreement is in place, it\u2019s a long process to get out of it. But of course, not implementing it is a possibility for a new administration. The bottom line is that those who believe in the climate change fight must keep putting the effort in, Solberg continues. People who continue to deny will fall back, and lose out in the future. And we shouldn\u2019t forget that America has never been in the front line of the fight against climate change. As Friedman wryly points out, it\u2019s a little worrying that there are Neo-nazi parties in Europe who believe in climate change, while one of America\u2019s two major political parties doesn\u2019t. Former US vice-president Al Gore is speaking about climate change now, saying there are only three questions remaining on the climate crisis: Must we change? Can we change? Will we change? Gore than takes a swipe at Donald Trump\u2019s administration, saying: On the first question, must we change, most people in the world are now convinced; but we are reminded by some recent elections and appointments that not everyone is there. It\u2019s just been confirmed that 2016 was the hottest year in recorded history, Gore continues, for the third year running. And he adds that the public are seeing the consequences: Every night on the television news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelations. People are connecting the dots and coming to the realisation that the answer to that first question is yes. On \u2018can we change?\u2019, Gore says the cost of renewable energy is coming down as dramatically as computer chips. And on \u2018will we change?\u2019, Gore says the Paris Agreement is \u201cthe most inspiring and greatest accomplishment since the whole negotiating process began\u201d. It has sent a signal to business, individuals, civil society - that signal has been received and had a dramatic change. The link between the pound and the FTSE 100 continues to hold. A dip in sterling - partly on profit taking after Tuesday\u2019s gains in the wake of UK prime minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech - has given a lift to the leading index. The FTSE 100 - which is full of overseas earners who benefit when the pound is weaker - closed up 27.23 points or 0.38% at 7247.61. The pound is currently down 0.8% against the dollar at $1.2304 and 0.5% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1521. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Trading on the FTSE was muted the day after suffering its biggest loss in six months. The British pound, drifting lower in a correction of its biggest daily gain since 2008, helped the UK equity benchmark to modest gains. We view the move in the British pound following Prime Minister\u2019s speech as a game-changer and as such don\u2019t anticipate a near-term resumption of the record winning streak for the FTSE 100. UK multinationals, like Burberry, still stand to benefit from a weak pound. The shift in sentiment in the pound means that gains could now be more concentrated in specific companies and industries, rather than the entire UK stock market. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.51% to 11,599.39 while France\u2019s Cac has closed 0.13% higher at 4853.40. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 20 points or 0.1% lower. Just 21% of delegates at WEF this year are female, despite years of pressure (companies can send an extra delegate as long as one member of the party is a woman). IMF chief Christine Lagarde has highlighted the scale of the problem. We just ran into Liam Fox, the UK\u2019s secretary of state for international trade, as he arrived at WEF. Fox says he\u2019s at Davos make the the case for free trade, and make sure that global markets don\u2019t \u201csilt up\u201d. He\u2019s also here to support Theresa May, who gives a special address to Davos on Thursday morning. Sitting alongside Pierre Moscovici, economist Joseph Stiglitz says that if Europe can\u2019t build the institutions to make the euro work it should admit that it has failed. Unless there is such a mechanism, he says, Europe should \u201cface reality, say this has been an interesting experiment but currencies come and go.\u201d Stiglitz says Europe should not give up on integration, but should simply go about it in a different way. The euro, he says, has \u201cundermined solidarity\u201d. The answer to Europe\u2019s problems is to have more Europe, not less, Moscovici adds (isn\u2019t it always?!). \u201cWe need more convergence, more policy tools, a budget and a minster of finance for the EU. We must invest more.\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for the economy, is speaking at a session on The European Disunion. He admits that people are not happy. \u201cPeople suffer from too weak growth, too high unemployment and too much debt. There\u2019s economic anger and cultural anger.\u201d But he insists that the \u201cEU is solid and a unique model\u201d. The three things Europe needs are economic efficiency, to protect its citizens, and to be more democratic and accountability. Guy Standing, professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)  has been telling Davos that the time has come for a universal income for all citizens. Standing says he has been making the case for a basic income to be paid to everyone regardless of whether they are rich or poor for many years but the idea has recently started to get attention because of the fears of job losses from automation. \u201cA basic income is not a panacea but it is part of the new redistribution we should be building for the 21st Century.\u201d Standing says there are three arguments for a basic income: social justice, freeing people from those wielding arbitrary power, and the provision of basic security.He says a basic income is easily affordable and could be paid for by taking the proceeds of \u201crentier capitalism. \u201cThe returns to property and intellectual property and natural resources are going to a minority and we must do something about that.\u201d Standing bemoans the fact that Britain did not use its oil revenues during the North Sea boom to set up a sovereign wealth fund. \u201cHad Britain set up a sovereign wealth fund, as Norway did, it could be paying out more than a basic income\u201d, he said. In one of those \u2018only at Davos\u2019 moments, 17 Pok\u00e9mon Go \u201cPok\u00e9stops\u201d have been set up around the ski resort to (possibly) raise awareness of inequality. It\u2019s the brainchild of film director Richard Curtis\u2019s development agency, called Project Everyone. Stops include worthy causes like \u201cZero Hunger\u201d and \u201cGood Health.\u201d According to Business Insider, Olympic medal-winning sprinter Michael Johnson and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver have been spotted playing the game. Curtis is hoping that others follow suit, saying: \u201cI\u2019m hoping a surprising number might think it is quite an amusing thing to do. I\u2019ve noticed the Davos audience are quite willing to laugh at even quite weak jokes, because they\u2019re looking for entertainment!\u201d Just be careful on those icy pavements... Away from Davos for a moment once more, and US consumer prices rose in December, up 2.1% year on year mainly due to higher fuel prices as crude recovered more ground from its recent lows. That was the biggest year on year gain since the middle of 2014 and rose from a figure of 1.7% in November, although it was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations. The month on month figure showed a rise of 0.3% in the consumer price index, compared to 0.2% in November. With price pressures increasing - especially if Donald Trump follows through with his promises to boost spending - the chances of a US rate hike are also rising. When the Federal Reserve increased rates in December, it predicted three more rises this year. James Knightley, senior economist at ING Bank, said: Both headline and core inflation are rising faster than 2% year on year, helping to build the case for further Fed rate hikes. US consumer price inflation came in exactly in line for December with the headline rate rising 0.3% month on month leading to an annual inflation rate of 2.1% versus 1.7% in November. The core (ex food and energy) rose 0.2% month on month leaving the annual rate at 2.2% versus 2.1% previously. This is the first time that both headline and core US inflation is rising at 2% or more since the second quarter of 2014. Fuel prices were the main culprit with energy prices rising 1.5% month on month and transportation costs increasing 1% month on month. Most other components rose 0.2% or 0.3% but there was some softness in food (flat on the month) and apparel (-0.7% month on month). With headline inflation likely to move up towards 2.5% in the second half of the year and President Trump promising pro-growth and pro-job policies in what already is a fairly strong story, it means further Federal Reserve rate hikes are not far away. We expect the next one in March with a further move higher in the third quarter of 2017. Europe needs to spend more on defence to protect the Transatlantic Alliance, says Germany\u2019s defence minister. Ursula von der Leyen told a panel that: Europe has to take a fair share of the burden. It\u2019s not at that point that now, so we have to invest more in defence. We want a strong European pillar within Nato, she continues, and the ability to tackle more problems in Africa. Nato\u2019s future bas been cast into doubt by Donald Trump; von der Leyen see a bright future, though. I\u2019m very confident that this wonderful and precious friendship will last long. Von der Leyen says the Alliance between the US and Europe goes beyond military issues; it is based on a long period of friendship and trust, and shared values: We are fighting for something \u2014 for democracy, for the open society, the rule of law. Frederick Pempe, CEO of The Atlantic Council, agrees, saying that he\u2019s caution against seeing the \u2018death knell\u2019 of the Transatlantic Alliance. Currently, the US spends $600bn per year on military spending, while European countries spend $300bn. Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg is also on this panel about \u2018positive narratives\u2019. She explains how it\u2019s important that people have a \u2018common understanding\u2019 of the past, to help create a shared identity. That\u2019s not helped, of course, by the flood of fake news and online misinformation we\u2019ve seen recently on places like, well, Facebook..... If you look at the history of mankind, you see that societal change and progress is a messy thing, Meg Whitman continues. Her message to leaders at Davos is to \u201cbe the change you want to create\u201d. Sometimes these problems are so overwhelming that if you carve out something that matters to you, that you can make a big difference to, that can push the ball down the field. Technology has pulled 100s of millions of people out of poverty, it has connected a lot of people, it has modernised agriculture and medicine. But it\u2019s also creating economic dislocation, the HP boss continues. It\u2019s up to leaders in this room, particularly in the technology field, to think \u2018how do we help manage the transition of people who have been disrupted by robotics or automation\u2019 -- which by the way is a far bigger cause of job losses in the US than economic globalisation. That includes retraining workforces, pooling hiring across companies, to create opportunities for people where they are. Despite the gloom in the global economy, is there a \u2018positive narrative\u2019 out there? On a panel session in the main hall (livefeed here), documentary maker Sharmeen Obaid- Chinoy says technology is giving people more control. People want to take ownership of their stories, especially young people. There are a lot of anxieties. Violence against women in many parts of the world has gone up, but so has access to technology and women are now more aware of their rights. Young people are now beginning to break free. Their anxieties focus on if they\u2019ll have the same opportunities as their grandparents. Will they be told what do by the leaders in their countries, or will they break through? I see less anxiety in the places I work, and more hope. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, says that there needs to be a better discussion about the impact that technology has on jobs. Meg Whitman of HP is blunter, saying that \u201csome of the chickens have come home to roost\u201d. That includes: Declining trust in institutions Economic dislocation leading to the refugee crisis Economic dislocation caused by technology. And technology will only have a bigger impact, she warns, as AI, robotics and 3D printing all develop. So \u201cwe need to create a new narrative\u201d, Whitman adds, based on the right thing for the economy, and giving more hope to people who have been dislocated by technology. Here\u2019s a video clip of Joe Biden telling the global elite at Davos to pull their weight. Mike Gregoire, the chief executive of software giant CA Technologies, has criticised the idea that simply taxing the 1% richest more will solve our economic problems. Speaking to me at Davos, he says the key is to invest more in science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills, to help people in the new economy (a theme Joe Biden touched on in his speech too). Gregoire says: The lack of both business and governments, and I say both, focusing on retraining people in STEM education for the jobs of the future, rather than trying to protect a job of the past, needs a lot more work. The notion of this 1% - it\u2019s a very convenient argument. The math doesn\u2019t work. If you want to talk about taxpayers - I\u2019m a 60% taxpayer, and my company is a 30% taxpayer. If you charge every company and every person, you can\u2019t tax them enough that it would make a difference if you haven\u2019t attacked the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is that the economy is changing, and the value curve is changing, and the skill sets are changing, and that\u2019s what we should focus our attention on. Gregoire adds that modern manufacturing is much cleaner than in the past, has fewer people and it\u2019s highly automated - and that automation will increase. So what are you doing to prepare people for that economy, rather than the economy of the past? CA supports several organisations that promote STEM skills, including Tech Girls Rock. Gregoire is also a board member of Npower, which helps minorities develop the skills to get a tech job. Gregoire explains why this is important: We\u2019re talking about a whole generation of folks who could add value to our economy, and they just don\u2019t have the skills because they haven\u2019t been trained to be able to participate. That\u2019s something we can all help lean into. Here\u2019s foreign policy expert David Rothkopf on Biden\u2019s farewell speech. While Joe Biden was criticising Russia, his predecessor Al Gore was speaking at the Davos Arctic Camp - set up by climate scientists to focus attention on global warning. We should hear more from Gore later today (he\u2019s on a climate panel at 6pm Davos time) Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s top-level panel on the middle class crisis. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has called for urgent action to tackle a middle-class crisis as she warned that inequality, distrust and a lack of hope were fuelling growing political populism. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Lagarde said she had first highlighted the dangers of rising inequality four years ago but had been ignored. \u201cI hope people will listen now,\u201d she said. Lagarde said the gulf between rich and poor was evident from an Oxfam report showing that eight billionaires own the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the world\u2019s population \u2013 3.6 billion people. \u201cWith lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes in the advanced economies,\u201d she said. Here\u2019s the full story: Away from Davos briefly and some more reaction to the UK jobs numbers. Some analysts, while acknowleding the latest figures are generally positive, wonder if the momentum can continue. Nina Skero, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: Given the low unemployment rate and still modest, but accelerating wage growth it may be difficult to think of the labour market as anything but robust. However, other indicators suggest that a labour market softening may not be far off. The latest employment figures saw a decline of 9,000 persons compared to the June to August period. Correspondingly, the proportion of people in work decreased by 0.1 percentage points compared to June to August 2016 and now stands at 74.5%. The Claimant Count statistics, which are considered experimental by the ONS but are the most timely, also suggest that the labour market may be losing some steam. In December 2016, the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits declined by 10,100 compared to November 2016 but was 26,900 higher than in December 2015. With the economy set for a slowdown in 2017 and 2018, many firms will be more reluctant to hire. A worst case scenario could even see some businesses lay off existing staff. For instance, many companies that rely on imports find themselves in a tricky situation given that a weaker pound has increased their production costs but they are unable to raise prices drastically due to fear of losing market share. One option for such firms will be to cut down on spending by reducing head counts. On the bright side, although the labour market may soften in the coming year it is starting its marginal decline from a place of strength. While we expect the unemployment rate to increase from current levels in 2017, it will remain below rates seen for much of 2015 and 2014. The real risk lies within wage growth which despite the acceleration in the most recent data has been unimpressive in the post-crisis period and now stands to be overtaken by inflation. Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Europe, said: The main headlines from the UK labour market report continued the recent run of relatively optimistic news on the state of the economy. The unemployment rate held at 4.8%, the fall in the level of employment of 9k 3m/3m was smaller than the 35k decrease expected and average earnings growth picked up to 2.8% 3m/y (inc. bonuses), the strongest since September 2015. Private sector average earnings growth is now above 3% 3m/y and above 4% 3m/y in the retail/restaurant sector, each for the first time since Q3 2015. The relative weakness in terms of private sector pay is the financial and business service sector where growth is just 1.9% 3m/y. As with the inflation data yesterday, this development won\u2019t ease the MPC\u2019s concerns about the anticipated period of above-target CPI. In our assessment there is a very good chance that unemployment rises to 4.9% next month, but the more concerning element of the report is the news on total hours worked (but also note the highest number of redundancies at 123k since Q1 2014). In the three months to November 2016 total hours worked fell 1.2mn compared to the three months to August. This comprises both the modest fall in the level of employment as well as a reduction in average hours worked to 31.9/wk... As we flagged recently, the near-term risk to our 1.2% 2017 GDP forecast is that the headwinds we have identified don\u2019t materialise as quickly as expected at the start of the year, with survey evidence on the outlook remaining impressive at the end of 2016. That is likely to lead the Bank of England to revise up its GDP forecast at the February Inflation Report but the scale of any such optimistic revisions should be tempered given the context of less encouraging news on the quantity of labour being used in the economy. London mayor Sadiq Khan is in Davos today, as part of his push to protect the capital, and its financial centre, from harm from Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. He\u2019s holding various meeting, and will also address business leaders tonight at a Morgan Stanley dinner. According to his office, he will say: \u201cSecuring privileged access to the single market must be the top priority for the negotiations. It\u2019s critical for London. Nothing else will do. It can\u2019t be brushed aside \u2013 as it was yesterday. \u201cA hard-line approach to Brexit \u2026\u2026. could rip Britain apart. \u201cAnd if we continue on this path - towards a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 \u2013 we risk having to explain to future generations why we knowingly put their economy, their prosperity and their place on the world stage in such peril.\u201d Biden left the stage to a rousing standing ovation - but I suspect it won\u2019t be last time we see him at Davos: The FT\u2019s Katie Martin has a good take on Joe Biden\u2019s sting criticism of Russia, in his final speech as vice-president. US vice president Joe Biden has pointed the finger of blame specifically at Russia for seeking to \u201cwhittle away at the edges of the European project.\u201d The country, he said, is \u201ctesting the fault lines between western nations.\u201d Mr Biden described himself as a committed supporter of globalisation, while issuing a plea to defend the \u201cliberal international order\u201d and the close ties between the US and Europe that he describes as key to securing prosperity and security. \u201cImpulses to hunker down, to build walls, are precisely the wrong answer,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s the full story: Biden ends his final speech as US vice-president with a rousing call for Europe and the US to \u201clead the fight\u201d to defend the values that created today\u2019s world. That means: A fight for democracy, a fight to reject isolationism and protectionism\u201d. Quite a way to bow out of office. Biden then turns to geopolitics, and singles out Russia. Under president Putin, Russia has been testing the fault lines in other nations, says Biden. It is trying to return to a world of \u2018spheres of influences\u2019, even sending \u2018little green men\u2019 across borders to stir up separatism in Ukraine. And he insists that Nato\u2019s \u2018sacred\u2019 commitment to defend each other from attacks can never be questioned (a nudge towards Donald Trump, who has suggested the alliance is obsolete) Looking into his audience of global leaders in Davos, Biden says a \u201cprogressive tax system\u201d where everyone pays a fair share will help address the crisis. And he appeals to their better nature, saying: I told a group of you last night - the top 1%\u2019s not carrying their weight You\u2019re not bad guys, you\u2019re good guys. If you speak to the public and ask if they\u2019d rather have free college education, or a raise - they\u2019d take the free college education, Biden continues. Biden also says that people also need \u201ccontinuing education\u201d through their lives to help them adjust to technology change, and we must ensure basic protections for workers. Millions of people around the world have benefitted from globalisation and new technology, Biden continues. But in other places, factories are closing and jobs are being lost. Taken together, these forces are effectively hollowing out the middle-class, the traditional engine of economic growth and social stability in Western nations. We cannot undo the changes that technology has wrought in our world, nor should we try. But we can and we must take action to mitigate the economic trends that are stoking unrest in so many advanced economies and undermining people\u2019s basic sense of dignity. Biden is speaking about how the liberal world order pioneered by the US and Europe after world war 2 delivered unprecedented growth and security; but it is now at threat. He explains how his father had explained that a job was about more than just a pay cheque; it was also about self respect and worth. And he talks about how workers are losing out: In my country, there used to be a basic bargain since the mid-20th century, agreed by both parties.... If you contributed to the success of the enterprise that you were engaged, you got to share the success and the profits. Biden begins by telling that there is \u201cpalpable uncertainty about the state of the world.\u201d And he doesn\u2019t mean the transfer of power in America this week. In two days there will be a new president of the United States...  calls out one delegate. No, Biden replies. The challenges we face, and the choices we must make as an international community doesn\u2019t hinge exclusively on Washington\u2019s leadership. Whether we reinforce the ties that bind us or whether we unravel under the current pressure. These choices must be made by very single nation. Davos delegates have flooding into the main hall here to watch the set-piece event of the morning, vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s final speech in office. Biden gets a warm, standing ovation as he arrives on stage. And he gets a second round of applause as he introduces himself as \u201cvice-president for the next 48 hours, and after that I\u2019ll be able to say what I really think\u201d. You can watch it live here: The number of people in work in the UK dipped slightly in the three months to November compared to the previous quarter, but average weekly earnings came in higher than expected and the claimant count for December fell by more than forecast. The jobless rate for the three months held at an 11 year low of 4.8%, in line with forecasts, and unemployment fell from 1.65m to 1.6m. But the number of people in work fell by 9,000 to just over 31.8m. This is the second report in a row to show a dip in the number of people in work, perhaps suggesting a slight degree of reluctance among employers in the wake of the Brexit vote. Average weekly earnings including bonuses rose from 2.6% to 2.8% compared to expectations of a figure of 2.6%. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits fell by 10,100 in December after rising by 1,300 in the previous month. Analysts had expected a rise of 5,000 in the claimant figures. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets UK, said: We had another set of promising economic data today which has shown that average earnings have increased and unemployment claims have fallen. It was important that the average earning index picks up pace to keep up with inflation. The inflation data released earlier has already brought headache for the MPC members and it is not a good news for consumers because their purchase power is going to see a dramatic impact. Households will have to dig deeper in their pockets and if their earnings do not match inflation, we have a problem. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: Overall, with employment levels still close to record levels and unemployment continuing to fall, the latest indicators confirm that the UK jobs market remains a major bright spot for the UK economy. While labour market conditions could soften over the next year as economic growth slows, the high degree of flexibility in the jobs market will help limit the extent of any uptick in unemployment. Although there was a welcome pick-up in average earnings growth, the gap between wage and price growth is narrowing. If this continues as we expect, real household incomes will be squeezed further, stifling consumer spending, which is a key driver of UK economic growth. Elsewhere in Davos, delegates have been discussing the gender divide, and how fighting stereotypes can fix it: Do any of the global elite do their own laundry, I wonder... Another takeaway from that session: Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan concludes the session on the middle class crisis with a three-point plan. 1) We need to take populists seriously, he argues, and not just paint them as the bad guys. Often they are the good guys, with genuine concerns about the future. 2) There is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d or short cut to fixing the economic problems fuelling populism. The solutions are complicated 3) Policymakers must deliver a vision of a better future; something that is lacking in Europe right now. Lagarde insists there is still time for \u201ccourageous\u201d politicians to reconnect with the people. They must create policies that address concerns such, as what future their children face and what safety net will be in place. There is hope, and I don\u2019t think we should be resigned to taking the situation as it is. Lagarde argues that globalisation needs to take \u201ca new turn\u201d, and we need more analytical work how jobs are being lost to new technologies. She says: To turn our back to globalisation, to helping development, is entirely the wrong approach. She also cites Oxfam\u2019s warning that the 8th richest people own as much wealth as the poorest half of the population. More from Larry Summers: Hedge fund chief Ray Dalio warns that the age of globalisation may be over, as provincialism and nationalism rise. Larry Summers, though, points out that Dalio won\u2019t suffer -- he\u2019ll manage to position himself in the markets whatever happens. The people who will be the victims of populist policies are the lower income and middle class people in whose name the policy is offered. Italy\u2019s finance minister points out that many Europeans blame the leaders in Brussels, or the central bankers in Frankfurt, for the situation today. Larry Summers, though, disputes whether concerns over income inequality really explain the crisis in the middle classes. The US has just elected the world\u2019s biggest example of conspicuous consumption, he says That is a bizarre manifestation of a concern over inequality. Many people think \u201ctoo much is being done for the poor, rather than that too little is being done for the poor\u201d. Summers argues that the surge in support for populism is due to issues like \u201cnational unity and strength\u201d, not just envy over wealth. Lagarde reveals that she felt a backlash from economists, including in the IMF, after she warned about rising inequality in 2013. Policymakers need to get the signal now, and really think about how to address the public discontent. That means fiscal and structural reforms, and effective monetary policies, but it also includes redistributing wealth better, the IMF chief says: It needs to be granular, it needs to be regional, it needs to be focused on what will people get out of it. It probably includes more redistibution than we have in place at the moment. Bridgewater\u2019s Ray Dalio says populism is now the biggest issue in the global economy, overtaking central banks. Harvard professor Larry Summers says that populism is on the rise because many people in the middle classes of advanced economies feel their governments aren\u2019t fighting for them. They feel the governments are fighting for people in developing countries, for people who have recently come into their countries, for minority groups who used to suffer discrimination, but not the people \u201cin the centre of the country\u201d. They feel they are not being heard, and they\u2019ve expressed that in the Brexit vote, the Italian referendum and in the US election. Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan agrees with Christine Lagarde that the middle classes are in crisis. It is hard to find a country where there isn\u2019t dissatisfaction with the situation today, says Padoan. He cites changes in wealth and income distribution - and about people\u2019s expectations. The middle class is disillusion about the future, disappointed about the figure of their children, and unhappy about the benefits they\u2019re receiving from the state. The session gets under way - here\u2019s a live feed: Christine Lagarde speaks first, and agrees that the middle classes in advanced economies are now in crisis. The middle class is both growing and shrinking, she points out.. Globally, it\u2019s grown from 7% of the global population to 13%. But in America, it\u2019s shrunk from 60-ish% to 50-ish% -- with more money accumulating at the top. That is combined with signs of lack of trust, lack of hope, disenchantment with the vision of the future. With lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes in the advanced economies. Speaking of things that make people angry... Here\u2019s the pitch for the first big session of the morning: Squeezed and Angry: How to Fix the Middle-Class Crisis The middle class is squeezed and aggrieved. Once the lynchpin of developed economies, it\u2019s now threatened by job losses and stagnant wages, paving the way for the rise of populism. In emerging markets, middle class growth rates are stalling. Have middle class problems been forgotten? What can be done? IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan and Founder, Chairman and Co-CIO of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, discuss what\u2019s needed to restore growth in the middle class and confidence in the future. Good morning from Davos, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. Today, some of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful people will be discussing why the rest of the population are increasingly angry and disillusioned with the state of the world. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, will ponder how to fix the middle class crisis, alongside Italian finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan and Harvard professor Larry Summers. Plus, (this is Davos after all) a billionaire! Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, will also chip in. Hopefully we\u2019ll get some decent ideas on how to boost employment prospects and income growth. After yesterday\u2019s focus on globalisation, potential trade wars and president Trump, today will also focus on climate change. A group of scientists has set up an Arctic base camp in Davos, to highlight the dangers of climate change and the warming ice caps. And we salute them for sleeping out in tents last night -- when it was minus 16 degrees C. Europe is also on the agenda, with panel sessions on Brexit, the European Union, and the Transatlantic Alliance. There\u2019s also going to be a scrum to see Joe Biden address delegates, on his final overseas trip as vice-president. Here\u2019s some of the key events today: 9am Davos time/8am GMT: Panel: How to fix the middle-class crisis 10am/9am GMT: Arctic basecamp press conference 10.30am/9.30am GMT: Special address by Joe Biden 1.45pm/12.45pm GMT: Is the Transatlantic Alliance at a tipping point? 2.45pm/1.45pm Fixing European disunion 5pm/4pm GMT: How to accelerate the fight against climate change, with Al Gore",

The pound is currently down 0.8% against the dollar at $1.2304 and 0.5% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1521. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trading on the FTSE was muted the day after suffering its biggest loss in six months. The British pound, drifting lower in a correction of its biggest daily gain since 2008, helped the UK equity benchmark to modest gains.</p> <p>We view the move in the British pound following Prime Minister\u2019s speech as a game-changer and as such don\u2019t anticipate a near-term resumption of the record winning streak for the FTSE 100.

Nina Skero, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the low unemployment rate and still modest, but accelerating wage growth it may be difficult to think of the labour market as anything but robust. However, other indicators suggest that a labour market softening may not be far off. The latest employment figures saw a decline of 9,000 persons compared to the June to August period. Correspondingly, the proportion of people in work decreased by 0.1 percentage points compared to June to August 2016 and now stands at 74.5%.</p> <p>The Claimant Count statistics, which are considered experimental by the ONS but are the most timely, also suggest that the labour market may be losing some steam. In December 2016, the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits declined by 10,100 compared to November 2016 but was 26,900 higher than in December 2015.</p> <p>With the economy set for a slowdown in 2017 and 2018, many firms will be more reluctant to hire. A worst case scenario could even see some businesses lay off existing staff. For instance, many companies that rely on imports find themselves in a tricky situation given that a weaker pound has increased their production costs but they are unable to raise prices drastically due to fear of losing market share. One option for such firms will be to cut down on spending by reducing head counts.</p> <p>On the bright side, although the labour market may soften in the coming year it is starting its marginal decline from a place of strength. While we expect the unemployment rate to increase from current levels in 2017, it will remain below rates seen for much of 2015 and 2014. The real risk lies within wage growth which despite the acceleration in the most recent data has been unimpressive in the post-crisis period and now stands to be overtaken by inflation.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12a7e6083aaa417a392190b443e07f9dddc22a5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12a7e6083aaa417a392190b443e07f9dddc22a5e/598_201_4714_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unemployment rate holds steady but could start to rise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unemployment rate holds steady but could start to rise</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Global Warming Images/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Europe, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The main headlines from the UK labour market report continued the recent run of relatively optimistic news on the state of the economy. The unemployment rate held at 4.8%, the fall in the level of employment of 9k 3m/3m was smaller than the 35k decrease expected and average earnings growth picked up to 2.8% 3m/y (inc. bonuses), the strongest since September 2015.</p> <p>Private sector average earnings growth is now above 3% 3m/y and above 4% 3m/y in the retail/restaurant sector, each for the first time since Q3 2015. The relative weakness in terms of private sector pay is the financial and business service sector where growth is just 1.9% 3m/y. As with the inflation data yesterday, this development won\u2019t ease the MPC\u2019s concerns about the anticipated period of above-target CPI.</p> <p>In our assessment there is a very good chance that unemployment rises to 4.9% next month, but the more concerning element of the report is the news on total hours worked (but also note the highest number of redundancies at 123k since Q1 2014). In the three months to November 2016 total hours worked fell 1.2mn compared to the three months to August. This comprises both the modest fall in the level of employment as well as a reduction in average hours worked to 31.9/wk...</p> <p>As we flagged recently, the near-term risk to our 1.2% 2017 GDP forecast is that the headwinds we have identified don\u2019t materialise as quickly as expected at the start of the year, with survey evidence on the outlook remaining impressive at the end of 2016.

      "bodyText": "In a persistent drizzle on 17 January, a group of protesters swathed in green ponchos unfurled tarps and sleeping bags on the sidewalk in front of Goldman Sachs\u2019 high-rise building on the West Side highway in New York City. A few of them wore handmade swamp creature masks; others bore signs with the swamp creatures on them. A light-board sign declared the bank \u201cGovernment Sachs\u201d. The protest was the beginning of a multi-day camp-out aiming to stay on the sidewalk outside the investment bank until the inauguration of Donald Trump, and to bring people affected by the bank\u2019s policies to the doorstep of some of the world\u2019s richest people \u2013 some of whom will belong to the Trump administration. \u201cIt\u2019s about highlighting the lie that was told to millions of people in this country, the lie that Trump was draining the swamp. If we really want the swamp to be drained, we have to do it ourselves and we\u2019re doing it by going to Goldman Sachs,\u201d says Nelini Stamp of the Working Families party. As the crowd of about 100 people set up camp, the police erected barricades around them but mostly held off as the crowd moved from chanting \u201cThe swamp is getting deeper! The swamp is Goldman Sachs!\u201d to a series of speak-outs from the crowd about the bank\u2019s connection to payday lending, the economic crisis in Puerto Rico, foreclosures and more. For Jean Sassine, who lost his job and nearly lost his home during the 2008 financial crisis, fighting the influence of the big banks in Washington is personal. He became a member of community organization New York Communities for Change (NYCC) six years ago as a way to fight back, and for him the Goldman action \u201cmeans trying to wake people up that these are the people who were part of the big crisis in 2008, that Steven Mnuchin was called Mr Foreclosure at OneWest and Goldman Sachs. Do you want Mr Foreclosure to be secretary of the treasury?\u201d The organizers targeted Goldman Sachs because, as Stamp explains, the bank \u201cis a pipeline to government\u201d. Through Democratic and Republican administrations, she notes, Goldman Sachs in particular has fed its bankers into high-ranking government positions \u2013 if Mnuchin is confirmed as treasury secretary, Trump will be the third of the past four presidents to have hired for that job from Goldman\u2019s ranks. To Stamp, particularly in the post-financial crisis era, this means the bank is being rewarded for its involvement in subprime mortgages and the financial instruments created to profit from them. On that front, says Renata Pumerol of NYCC, it is important to confront the power brokers directly as well as the elected officials who work with them. Calling them \u201cGovernment Sachs\u201d is a way to highlight the level to which they have captured Washington and influence policy that benefits themselves. As for the occupation itself, the tactic obviously brings echoes of Occupy Wall Street, but Pumerol says that this demonstration differs in its specific demands \u2013 to halt the appointment of Mnuchin as well as fellow Goldmanites Gary Cohn, Anthony Scaramucci, Dina Powell and Steve Bannon. Also, she notes, this action is led by people of color and people who have been directly affected by Goldman\u2019s actions. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting circle of life for someone like myself, who was involved with Occupy,\u201d Stamp adds, \u201cto see this fake crony populism of \u2018draining the swamp\u2019 while the swamp is actually continuing to be filled.\u201d \u2018Wall Street is a bipartisan opportunist\u2019 For many of the people involved in the Government Sachs action, it seemed obvious that Trump\u2019s promises to drain the swamp were less than genuine. But for Richard Robinson, they resonated and led him to vote for the president-elect. The 60-year-old veteran and truck driver from Utah lives on social security after a work accident nearly killed him and pushed him into medical retirement. Out of work, he says, he found himself \u201csitting at home feeling worthless, didn\u2019t feel like I was accomplishing anything\u201d. A friend suggested he get a hobby, and, he laughs: \u201cI became an activist, I guess.\u201d Robinson lives in a manufactured home community, and through forming a group called MH Action to deal with the issues that he and his neighbors faced, he began to get in touch with other people working on similar issues around the country. Robinson\u2019s community is owned by a multistate corporation that also owns apartment complexes in New York and Chicago, which helped him get in touch with NYCC. \u201cThese companies are buying communities, buying apartment complexes and their business model is not acceptable to me. It\u2019s to raise rents as quickly as possible and decrease maintenance of the communities, and that\u2019s not a good business model for America,\u201d he says. His vote for Trump, he says, was based on the assumption that because the president-elect was not a career politician, \u201cmaybe things would be run differently in Washington\u201d. But the number of Wall Streeters and ultra-wealthy in the administration has him frustrated, and brought him to New York in protest. \u201cHe actually hit Hillary Clinton over meeting behind closed doors with [Goldman Sachs] and now I believe he was meeting with them at the same time. He\u2019s appointed them so quickly that I\u2019ve got to believe at the same time he was campaigning hard on Hillary Clinton for meeting with them behind closed doors, I believe he was doing the same thing.\u201d Nomi Prins, former managing director at Goldman Sachs turned journalist and author of All the President\u2019s Bankers, says that rather than make sincere promises Trump simply attacked weaknesses, taking advantage of widespread anger at Wall Street to score points against first his Republican opponents and then Clinton. Mnuchin, she points out, was his finance adviser the whole time. \u201cThere were more apparent Wall Street connections through Hillary Clinton because of the foundation, the speeches and because of Bill Clinton that were real,\u201d she says, \u201cbut these are bipartisan relationships; Wall Street is a bipartisan opportunist.\u201d (That relationship is visible in New York City, where Alicia Glen, formerly of Goldman Sachs, serves as deputy mayor to Bill de Blasio.) That bipartisan relationship, and the bipartisan anger at the power of finance, is what makes it so important to target the banks and lay groundwork for white working-class communities to come together with communities of color to fight, Pumerol says. Adds Sassine: \u201cIt is clear that they are ready to raid the American people as opposed to benefiting. Government is supposed to be for the benefit of the people, whether you believe in small government, big government, it\u2019s supposed to be for the benefit of the people.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m the strongest, I\u2019m the best, I\u2019m the top dog\u2019 Goldman\u2019s tendency to wield outsize behind-the-scenes influence is part of the reason for the action, Pumerol says. People tend to think of the bank that they interact with daily, but Goldman, famously deemed the \u201cvampire squid\u201d by Matt Taibbi, has incredible reach. That reach has long extended right up to the presidency, Prins notes. In the wake of the Great Depression, Sidney Weinberg, the then head of Goldman, reinvented himself as an ally to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Even as Roosevelt railed that \u201cgovernment by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob\u201d, Weinberg helped raise money to put him in the White House. Goldman Sachs wasn\u2019t the only bank to have a close relationship with government, but its closeness with the halls of power stands out from FDR through to Bill Clinton, who took Robert Rubin to run the treasury, and George W Bush, who picked Hank Paulsen as his treasury secretary, a man widely criticized for handing bailout dollars to his cronies after the 2008 crash. Alexis Goldstein, senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform and a former Wall Streeter, notes that Goldman\u2019s reputation for being elite even among other big investment banks adds to its power. \u201cIn some ways that aligns with Trump; the idea of Trump being the best is much more about smoke and mirrors, but there is a parallel about I\u2019m the strongest, I\u2019m the best, I\u2019m the top dog.\u201d But beyond the idea of eliteness, Prins notes, the very nature of Washington has ensured a symbiotic relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s a place, as is Wall Street, where people rely on their connections. If you\u2019re already there, you can reach out to the next generation or your colleague and bring them in. It feeds on itself.\u201d And so conservatives have criticized Trump\u2019s choice of Mnuchin, who has donated to Democrats in the past and who Goldstein calls \u201ca banker\u2019s banker\u201d, noting that he is second-generation Goldman Sachs. Both Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, Prins points out, have a long history at Goldman, rising through its ranks and thriving in its high-pressure, high-risk culture. \u201cThose two are just examples of that particular element, running trading desks, working on complex products and securities, squeezing out the juice of financial instruments and taking big bets.\u201d On the other hand, Goldstein notes, Steve Bannon, who didn\u2019t last long at Goldman before leaving to, among other things, run Breitbart News, represents a different thread. \u201cHis rhetoric and the racism and white supremacy perpetuated by Breitbart is the kind of thing that Wall Street is very invested in maintaining that it is against,\u201d she says. The banks, she says, like to tout their diversity and welcoming nature and philanthropy, but \u201canyone who signs up with the Trump administration is more interested in power and money than justice and equality\u201d. There is no bigger sign of that than the impact of the foreclosure crisis, the gutting of public services of Jefferson County, Alabama, and other such dealings. Early in 2016, Goldman finally agreed to a $5bn settlement for fraudulently creating and selling mortgage-backed securities (a settlement that probably amounts to much, much less than advertised), but less than a year later, as Stamp notes, its second-in-command is headed to advise the new president. All of this leads Sassine of NYCC to be incredibly suspicious. Goldman, he notes, owns the mortgage on one of Trump\u2019s NYC buildings. \u201cHow serious is the president going to be against his landlord?\u201d Sassine asks. Camping out in January, if that\u2019s what it takes The encampment at Goldman Sachs is connected to a larger effort, one that extends across the country. The Working Families party has put out calls for action every Tuesday, meant to challenge the Trump administration and also to pressure Democratic elected officials to stand up to Trump. The previous Tuesday saw protesters outside the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s Brooklyn home to demand he whip votes against Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general. In Nevada, activists went to Senator Dean Heller\u2019s office with a similar demand. Richard Robinson is particularly concerned that the financiers in Trump\u2019s administration will aim to privatize the social security he depends on. \u201cWe should be strengthening the social security system within the government as it is, by increasing the taxes of corporate America and doing away with the [tax] cap, not turning it over to Wall Street and private industry \u2013 that\u2019s not a good system,\u201d he says. To that end, and to strengthen his MH Action group, he is looking forward to learning from the New York action. Goldstein points out that the wave of action around Trump\u2019s election is just the latest in recent years, building off the momentum of other mass demonstrations. \u201cI think the challenge moving forward is intake and absorption of all the people that are wondering: what should we do now? Courage is contagious, organizing is empowering, there was something about that particular alchemy that was powerful for me, as a participant in Occupy.\u201d Pumerol agrees, noting that the movements have got to step up in a more militant fashion in the next four years. \u201cWhen I heard camping out, I said: \u2018Oh dear God, camping out in the middle of January\u2019 \u2013 but that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d Sassine has a list of demands for the Trump administration to make him believe in their populism. \u201cWhen they put out a plan for a moratorium on foreclosures, when [the Department of Housing and Urban Development] stops selling my communities out wholesale, hundreds of mortgages at a time, when they put forth a living wage plan out, then they\u2019ll start convincing me.\u201d",

Courage is contagious, organizing is empowering, there was something about that particular alchemy that was powerful for me, as a participant in Occupy.\u201d </p> <p>Pumerol agrees, noting that the movements have got to step up in a more militant fashion in the next four years. \u201cWhen I heard camping out, I said: \u2018Oh dear God, camping out in the middle of January\u2019 \u2013 but that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d </p> <p>Sassine has a list of demands for the Trump administration to make him believe in their populism. </p> <p>\u201cWhen they put out a plan for a moratorium on foreclosures, when [the Department of Housing and Urban Development] stops selling my communities out wholesale, hundreds of mortgages at a time, when they put forth a living wage plan out, then they\u2019ll start convincing me.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Premier Foods, the maker of Mr Kipling cakes, Ambrosia rice pudding and Oxo stock cubes, have fallen sharply after it warned profits would be hit by rising costs linked to the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote. After a tough quarter in the run-up to Christmas, Premier said annual trading profits would be 10% lower than previously expected. City analysts had pencilled in trading profits of \u00a3130m and adjusted pre-tax profits of \u00a386m. The food producer blamed rises in commodity prices in the past 12 months. This was exacerbated by the slide in sterling since the June referendum, which had further driven up the cost of key ingredients such as sugar, cocoa, butter, wheat and palm oil, many of which are imported from abroad. Sugar is mainly priced in euros and much of the butter made in the UK is exported, which has also driven up prices. Premier shares ended the day down 11% at 42.75p (last April it rejected a \u00a31.5bn takeover offer from US food group McCormick worth 65p a share). Premier reiterated it would have to pass on some of the cost increases to retailers by pushing through \u201climited price increases where these cannot be avoided\u201d. For months it has been haggling with big supermarket groups such as Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s about price hikes of 5-6% on some ranges. Those discussions could carry on into the spring. Its sales have been hit by shoppers switching to cheaper, non-branded products and by supermarkets running fewer multi-buy offers. Premier\u2019s overall sales dipped 1% to \u00a3251m, with branded sales down 3.8% while non-branded sales rose 11.6% in the 13 weeks to 31 December. The company unveiled a cost cutting plan, which aims to save \u00a310m in each of the next two years. Outsourcing firm Mitie also blamed Brexit-related issues on Wednesday as it issued its third profit warning since September. Mitie shares were the second-biggest loser on the FTSE-250, falling 4.7% to 195.8p. The company now expects to make an underlying profit of \u00a360m to \u00a370m in the year to 31 March, a 30% downgrade. It said clients were continuing to defer decisions on new contracts and delaying investment plans in the wake of the Brexit vote, in particular in its property management and technical facilities management divisions. Mitie\u2019s cleaning division is also struggling. The firm brought in a new chief executive, Phil Bentley, who used to run British Gas and Cable &amp; Wireless Communications and started at Mitie in early December. He has held crisis meetings over the last two days to discuss strategy and reshuffle of senior management. In November, Mitie said it would pull out of its healthcare business, which provides home care for elderly people. The \u00a3128m cost of writing off the business plunged Mitie into a \u00a3100m pre-tax loss for the first half of the year. Brexit has been partly blamed for the threat to 280 jobs out of a workforce of 781 at the Pizza Factory in Nottingham, owned by food giant 2 Sisters. The Unite union held crunch talks with the company on Wednesday, before planned industrial action next week. The union said the company\u2019s new year message to employees was: \u201cAs [I] am sure you all know, we are in an extremely challenging economic environment following Brexit. We are facing very significant commodity and utility inflation on top of the national living wage increases. At the same time, retailer competition is intensifying, with growth harder to come by and value a key theme.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Forecasting is difficult, especially about the future, as the old line goes \u2013 but is it quite as hard as John Fallon, chief executive of Pearson, makes it seem? Two errors in 2016 were understandable, or at least not unique. Most big US educational publishers were too optimistic about the numbers of students enrolling in US colleges and the pace at which all students would opt to rent, rather than buy, their textbooks. Trickier to explain, however, is Fallon\u2019s relative confidence only three months ago. Last October, when revenues from higher education courseware material were running at minus 13% at the nine-month stage, Pearson spoke of \u201cimproving trends\u201d. In the event, revenues plunged 30% in the final quarter of the year. \u201cWe now assume that many of these downward pressures will continue,\u201d warned Wednesday\u2019s statement meekly. Profits for 2016 will still hit the \u00a3630m target but 2017 could see a decline. More significantly, the target of \u00a3800m for 2018 \u2013 which had been a totem of Fallon\u2019s long-term plans \u2013 has been abandoned, or \u201cwithdrawn\u201d in the cute phrasing. Another ambition was to keep paying dividends at least at the old rate. That, too, has been ditched. Against those upsets and a 27% fall in the share price, the proposed sale of Pearson\u2019s 42% stake in Penguin Random House was almost a side-story for shareholders. The entire educational market in the US, on which Pearson staked its future a decade ago, has been blasted from many directions. An \u201cunprecedented period of change and volatility\u201d \u2013 his description \u2013 is accurate, but the question is whether Pearson adapted fast enough in the print-to-digital revolution. Back in February 2014, a year into the job, Fallon reckoned Pearson was \u201cin the middle of what we believe will be a short, but difficult, transition\u201d. Three years later, the transition is having to become faster. Pearson will cut ebook rental prices by up to 50% on 2,000 titles and invest an extra \u00a350m at improving its digital capabilities. Fallon offered a spirited defence that, when the dust settles, the digital future in education will be stable, reliable and \u201cat least as profitable\u201d as the analogue past. The theory runs that educational publishing in the US is not like the newspaper business: prices for digital content, complete with tailored material and self-assessment features, might be lower but old-style printed textbooks will no longer pass through six hands. Will Fallon still be at Pearson to see his prophecy fulfilled or not? One doubts it. The share price has halved on his watch and chief executives tend not to survive five profits warnings in four years. Sidney Taurel, the chairman, is new-ish and thus hard to read \u2013 but Fallon should probably prepare for a short but difficult conversation.",

Most big US educational publishers were too optimistic about the numbers of students enrolling in US colleges and the pace at which all students would opt to rent, rather than buy, their textbooks.</p> <p>Trickier to explain, however, is Fallon\u2019s relative confidence only three months ago. Last October, when revenues from higher education courseware material were running at minus 13% at the nine-month stage, Pearson spoke of \u201cimproving trends\u201d. In the event, revenues plunged 30% in the final quarter of the year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/18/pearson-penguin-random-house-shares-dive-profit-warning\">Pearson profit warnings wipe almost \u00a32bn off its value</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe now assume that many of these downward pressures will continue,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/18/pearson-penguin-random-house-shares-dive-profit-warning\">warned Wednesday\u2019s statement</a> meekly. Profits for 2016 will still hit the \u00a3630m target but 2017 could see a decline. More significantly, the target of \u00a3800m for 2018 \u2013 which had been a totem of Fallon\u2019s long-term plans \u2013 has been abandoned, or \u201cwithdrawn\u201d in the cute phrasing. Another ambition was to keep paying dividends at least at the old rate. That, too, has been ditched. Against those upsets and a 27% fall in the share price, the proposed sale of Pearson\u2019s 42% stake in Penguin Random House was almost a side-story for shareholders.</p> <p>The entire educational market in the US, on which Pearson staked its future a decade ago, has been blasted from many directions. An \u201cunprecedented period of change and volatility\u201d \u2013 his description \u2013 is accurate, but the question is whether Pearson adapted fast enough in the print-to-digital revolution. Back in February 2014, a year into the job, Fallon reckoned Pearson was \u201cin the middle of what we believe will be a short, but difficult, transition\u201d. Three years later, the transition is having to become faster. Pearson will cut ebook rental prices by up to 50% on 2,000 titles and invest an extra \u00a350m at improving its digital capabilities.</p> <p>Fallon offered a spirited defence that, when the dust settles, the digital future in education will be stable, reliable and \u201cat least as profitable\u201d as the analogue past. The theory runs that educational publishing in the US is not like the newspaper business: prices for digital content, complete with tailored material and self-assessment features, might be lower but old-style printed textbooks will no longer pass through six hands.</p> <p>Will Fallon still be at Pearson to see his prophecy fulfilled or not? One doubts it. The share price has halved on his watch and chief executives tend not to survive five profits warnings in four years. Sidney Taurel, the chairman, is new-ish and thus hard to read \u2013 but Fallon should probably prepare for a short but difficult conversation.</p>",

The dispute centres on a move by some of the financial firms which use the Link network to reduce the fees they pay to allow their customers to withdraw cash from most of Link\u2019s 70,000 cash machines across the UK. About 40,000 of these are provided by independent suppliers to the network, the rest by banks and building societies. More than 97% of transactions through Link machines do not levy a charge for customers withdrawals. The fee paid by card issuers is based on fixed formula. The 30 or so members of the network are to debate proposals at a meeting next week. The proposals suggest a cut in the fee which is paid by card issuers to Link members. The interchange fees total about \u00a3900m a year. It could lead to the first major overhaul of the network since 2000 when cash machines provided by banks and building societies become free to use. Previously, the system had operated with separate machine-sharing arrangements between groups of banks rather than offering free access industry-wide. If an agreement cannot be reached, it is possible that some Link members could break away and start charging. Even if the cut in the interchange fee is agreed, it is possible that unprofitable machines \u2013 such as those rarely used \u2013 could be allowed to impose a charge for the first time. A spokesperson for Link confirmed changes were under discussion, saying: \u201cLink is reviewing its commercial model to ensure that it remains the ATM network of choice for as many card issuers and ATM providers as possible. \u201cAt present, all UK ATM and all major card issuers are connected to Link \u2026 We operate in a competitive market and there are other ATM networks in the UK available for card issuers and ATM operators if our commercial offer becomes unattractive. We are determined to avoid this situation,.\u201d Other ATM networks are provided by Visa and Mastercard, but these are mainly used for overseas transactions. The fee is currently calculated by dividing the cost of running the free-to-use network by the number of transactions. This means the costs rise for those banks whose customers are heavy users of rivals\u2019 cash machines. About 25% of the machines currently charge for withdrawals because they are operated by independent suppliers installed in locations such as convenience stores. Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 which is the biggest user of the network as it has the largest number of current account customers \u2013 has previously raised the need for a review of the system, which could result in many cash machines being removed to cut costs. The meeting is being held at a time of increased scrutiny of the sector by regulators, including the new Payment Systems Regulator. The Competition and Markets Authority has described the Link network as providing an \u201cessential service for millions of customers\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Almost \u00a32bn was wiped from the stock market value of Pearson after the beleaguered FTSE 100 company issued profit warnings for the next two years and said it would cut its payout to shareholders. The group is also putting up for sale its 47% stake in publisher Penguin Random House. Shares in the group plunged by 30% as it said its US education business suffered a near-one third slump in revenues in the final quarter of the year. John Fallon, the chief executive of Pearson, admitted that the company \u201cgot a few calls wrong\u201d at its US business last year, including a belief that college enrolments would stabilise and the huge impact of students renting books through services such as Amazon. He rejected suggestions that he should step down as chief executive but said he would start meeting with disgruntled shareholders in the coming days. \u201cI am accountable and I fully accept that accountability for the fact that we got two big calls wrong last year,\u201d he said. \u201cI am also accountable for leading the company through a far more difficult period than anyone could have imagined. The board have asked me and the management team to get on and that is what we are going to get on and do.\u201d Pearson has issued a string of profits warnings in recent years and axed more than 4,000 jobs last year. The cut in the dividend this year will bring to an end almost 25 years of annual increases. Penguin Random House is the world\u2019s largest book publisher, with titles ranging from Fifty Shades of Grey and The Girl on the Train, to Nigella Lawson and Jamie Oliver\u2019s recipe books. The sale of its stake could net about \u00a31.2bn for Pearson and would mark the final exit from its once-considerable non-education publishing empire, which previously included the Financial Times and a 50% stake in the publisher of the Economist. Bertlesmann, which owns 53% of Penguin Random House, said it was keen to increase its stake to as much as 75% with a further investor such as a private equity firm likely to take the remaining stake. Pearson said it will issue an \u201cexit notice\u201d to Bertelsmann \u201cwith a view to selling our stake or recapitalising the business and extracting a dividend\u201d. It is understood that Pearson\u2019s preferred outcome is to sell-out of the joint venture entirely. The world\u2019s largest education publisher has found itself struggling with a huge decline in textbook sales and the transition to digital learning following the rise of Amazon. \u201cThe education sector is going through an unprecedented period of change and volatility,\u201d said Fallon. \u201cOur higher education business declined further and faster than expected in 2016. We are taking more radical action to accelerate our shift to digital models, and to keep reshaping our business.\u201d Pearson said it had been able to maintain operating profits of about \u00a3630m in line with City expectations for 2016 \u2013 but only because the company was paying \u00a355m less than expected in management bonus payments. It expects profits of \u00a3570m-\u00a3630m this year, well below the City consensus of about \u00a3700m, and has slashed its target of \u00a3800m in operating profits for 2018. Pearson said the ongoing troubles at its North American higher education business, which accounts for about 45% of profits, meant that it would need to \u201crebase\u201d future dividend payments. The company has enjoyed a 24-year run of dividend increases, between 1991 and 2015. The 2016 dividend is being frozen and the cut to future payouts is a major blow to Fallon and senior management. \u201cOur argument has been, and remains, investors have no visibility on what this company looks like in five years,\u201d said Gary Paulin, the head of global equities for Northern Trust Capital Markets. \u201cThe one saving grace, the dividend, is now at significant risk. As, we suspect, is the chief executive\u2019s tenure.\u201d Pearson has issued five profit warnings in the four years since Fallon took over running the company from Marjorie Scardino in 2013. He formerly ran Pearson\u2019s international division. He has pocketed more than \u00a36m since becoming chief executive. This includes an estimate for his pay in 2016, which will not be made public until Pearson publishes its annual report later this year, as well as about \u00a31.5m in total annual and long-term incentive payments. Pearson said it was taking actions including investing a further \u00a350m in speeding up the digital element of its education business, and reducing ebook prices by up to 50% for 2,000 titles, \u201cmaking digital rental the best option for price-conscious students\u201d. Fallon said that its \u00a31.3bn higher education business in the US, which is about 50% tied to print text books, needed to move to a 75% digital model by 2020. He said that while currently Pearson gets one fee of more than $200 for its textbooks for three-year course use, services such as Amazon were eating away at its business by offering repeat rental options for each book to multiple students. \u201cAmazon and others buy in year one and rent five or six times over the course of three years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat rental has done is eat into new book sales and that has had bigger impact than we thought. If that $200 textbook is used by six students over three years we are not getting $200 per use, it is divided by six. In a digital model we get $70 to $110 every time.\u201d Fallon said as Pearson moves to a predominantly digital model, which will mean 5-6% declines in the US business each year while this happens, then its business \u201ccan\u2019t be disrupted in this way any more\u201d. \u201cYou know this is a business that is going to be a winner from the analogue to digital process,\u201d he said. \u201c[It will be] a much more stable, reliable, repeatable business [and] at least as profitable.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has called for urgent action to tackle a \u201cmiddle-class crisis\u201d hitting working people as she warned that inequality, distrust and a lack of hope were fuelling growing populism. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Lagarde said she had first highlighted the dangers of rising inequality four years ago but had been ignored. \u201cI hope people will listen now,\u201d she said. Lagarde said the gulf between rich and poor was evident from an Oxfam report showing that eight billionaires own the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the world\u2019s population \u2013 3.6 billion people. \u201cWith lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes [a US term to describe working people] in the advanced economies,\u201d she said. Lagarde added that the answer was not for countries to turn their back on globalisation but a mix of policies designed to stimulate activity and ensure the fruits of growth were more evenly spread. \u201cPolicymakers need to get the signal now, and really think about how to address the public discontent. It [the policy response] needs to be granular, it needs to be regional, it needs to be focused on what will people get out of it. It probably includes more redistribution than we have in place at the moment.\u201d Lagarde\u2019s view that the middle class was in crisis was shared by the outgoing US vice-president. Joe Biden said globalisation and new technology were in effect \u201chollowing out the middle class, the traditional engine of economic growth and social stability in western nations\u201d. He added: \u201cWe cannot undo the changes that technology has wrought in our world, nor should we try. But we can and we must take action to mitigate the economic trends that are stoking unrest in so many advanced economies and undermining people\u2019s basic sense of dignity.\u201d Addressing his audience directly, Biden said the top 1% was not \u201cpulling its weight\u201d and urged that income tax be made more progressive. Larry Summers, the Harvard professor and former US Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, questioned whether concern over income inequality really explained the crisis in the middle classes. \u201cThe US has just elected the world\u2019s biggest example of conspicuous consumption. That is a bizarre manifestation of a concern over inequality.\u201d This year\u2019s Davos has been dominated so far by concerns that the results of referendums in the UK and Italy together with the election of Donald Trump as US president represent a retreat from globalisation into nationalism and protectionism. Summers said many voters thought \u201ctoo much is being done for the poor, rather than that too little is being done for the poor\u201d, and suggested that the surge of populism was due to issues such as \u201cnational unity and strength\u201d, not just envy over wealth. Middle-class voters, he added, felt governments weren\u2019t working for them. \u201cThey feel the governments are fighting for people in developing countries, for people who have recently come into their countries, for minority groups who used to suffer discrimination, but not the people \u201cin the centre of the country\u201d. He added: \u201cThey feel they are not being heard, and they\u2019ve expressed that in the Brexit vote, the Italian referendum and in the US election.\u201d Summers was dismissive of the policies proposed by Trump, saying that the lesson of history was that populism ended up harming the people it was supposed to help. He said tax cuts would benefit the already super-rich and the small number of jobs relocated to the US by presidential strong-arming of corporations would be dwarfed by the jobs losses caused by the rise in the value of the dollar. \u201cThe people who will be the victims of populist policies are the lower-income and middle-class people in whose name the policy is offered,\u201d Summers said. The Italian finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, said there was no \u201csilver bullet\u201d that would solve the crisis but it was important to take populists seriously. \u201cPolicymakers must deliver a vision of a better future \u2013 something that is lacking in Europe right now,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s labour market showed signs of slowing in November as the number of people in work declined and wage growth slowed for the first time since August. The number of people in employment fell by 9,000 to 31.8 million while month-on-month wage growth, including bonuses, dropped from 2.9% to 2.8%. Analysts said the figures showed that a return to near 3% wage growth in the months after the Brexit vote appeared to have been short lived. John Philpott, director of theJobsEconomist.org, said the employment figures also revealed tumbling levels of self-employment, part-time working and employment of temporary workers, who had borne the brunt of the slowdown. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by headline news of falling unemployment and higher wage growth. The jobs market is at present slowing not growing, as those in precarious work know only too well,\u201d he said. Fathom Consulting said: \u201cWe detect a slight softening in the labour market towards the end of last year. Much of the reduction in unemployment reflected a decline in the number of people seeking work, rather than an increase in employment.\u201d The number of self-employed workers who say they work more than 16 hours a week declined by 49,000 in the three months to November, while the number of part-time employees dropped by 60,000 and temporary workers by 35,000. Only a sharp rise of 143,000 in the number of economically inactive people prevented the weaker jobs numbers from showing up as higher unemployment, Philpott said. The Office for National Statistics\u2019 preferred measure of the labour market data is based on a three-month average compared with the previous three months to iron out sometimes volatile month-on-month data. This showed that in the three months ending in November wage growth picked up and unemployment fell. Pay growth including bonuses picked up to 2.8% from 2.6% while unemployment fell by 52,000 to 1.6 million. The jobless rate was unchanged at 4.8% \u2013 still an 11-year low. The number of people claiming jobless benefits also fell, by 10,100 to 797,800, between November and December, defying City expectations of a 5,000 increase. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the UK jobs market was proving resilient and remained \u201ca major bright spot for the UK economy\u201d. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \u201cWhile employment is little changed on the quarter, the rate remains at an historical high. The rate at which pay is increasing continues to pick up in cash terms, though it remains moderate.\u201d The Resolution Foundation said the modest growth in pay was likely to fall back over the coming months, ending several years of healthy rises in incomes once inflation is taken into account. The thinktank\u2019s latest pay projection shows that with inflation rising sharply, real pay growth is poised to fall to around 1.4% in December, and to around 1% in January, less than half the pre-crisis average of 2.2%. The senior policy analyst Laura Gardiner said: \u201cPay growth is set to change rapidly as inflation picks up. The big question for this year is whether pay settlements respond to rising prices and a tight jobs market. If they don\u2019t, a fresh pay squeeze later this year remains on the cards.\u201d Rachel Smith, principal labour market economist at the employers group the CBI, said the flexibility of the labour market remained a mainstay of the UK economy and would be key to making a success of Brexit. But she added the government would need to step up investment to prevent a decline in living standards. \u201cPay growth is likely to be eroded by increasing inflation during this year, underlining the need for a regionally focused industrial strategy that powers the productivity growth that will enable wages to rise more swiftly,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has delivered a strong defence of globalisation, serving notice to Donald Trump that Beijing will seek to usurp America\u2019s traditional role as the champion of free trade and open markets. Xi used an hour-long address to the World Economic Forum (WEF) to take a number of sideswipes at the US president-elect, attacking Trump\u2019s protectionist views without mentioning him by name. After later meeting US vice-president Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Davos summit, Xi said that the world needed China and the United States to have a stable and cooperative relationship. He added that links between the two countries had \u201cweathered wind and rain, but generally have continued to forge ahead\u201d, saying that under Barack Obama there had been a \u201ccorrect\u201d development in relations. In the first speech by a Chinese president at the annual Davos meeting of global political and business leaders, Xi said China would keep its borders open, stressed that there would be no winners from a trade war, and urged that all countries continued to support the 2015 Paris climate change accord. With Trump preparing for Friday\u2019s inauguration in Washington, Xi used the opportunity to make clear that China was keen to take a bigger role on the global stage if the US lapsed into isolationism. \u201cPursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room,\u201d he said. \u201cWind and rain may be kept outside, but so is light and air.\u201d Trump campaigned on a strongly protectionist platform, pledging to protect US firms from unfair overseas competition and threatening tariffs on goods from China and Mexico. \u201cNo one will emerge as a winner in a trade war,\u201d Xi told a packed hall at the WEF. Xi said originally globalisation had been seen as Ali Baba\u2019s treasure trove but for many had become a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d. He added, however, that the economic liberalisation of the past quarter or a century was not the root cause of the world\u2019s many problems and that the financial crash of 2008 was the result of excessive pursuit of profit. IHS Markit\u2019s chief economist, Dr Nariman Behravesh, said: \u201cPresident Xi gave a very rigorous and articulate defence of globalisation. \u201cVery importantly, he made commitments about opening China up to more imports and foreign direct investment and making sure that China\u2019s exchange rate policy didn\u2019t destabilise the global economy. All this is very encouraging. \u201cHowever, actions speak louder than words. A lot will depend on what China does. This is a good start. This is a good set of commitments on his part. It is encouraging, but we will see what the follow-through is.\u201d Xi likened the global economy to a big ocean from which it was impossible to escape. \u201cAny attempt to cut off the flow of capital, goods, and people between economies, and channel the waters into the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks is simply not possible. China\u2019s move towards open markets had been choppy, with plenty of whirlpools and choking along the way,\u201d Xi added. \u201cBut we have learned to survive, and we must have the courage to keep swimming in the global market.\u201d Xi sought to counter fears that the US and China were heading for a currency or trade war. Beijing would keep its doors open and would not seek to drive down the value of its currency, the yuan. WEF founder Klaus Schwab said Xi\u2019s presence was a sign of the shift from a uni-polar world dominated by the US to a more multi-polar system in which rising powers such as China will have to step up and play a bigger role. Li Shuo, senior global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia, welcomed the commitment on global warming. \u201cGiven the current volatility of global politics, President Xi Jinping\u2019s address helped calm nerves. His reference to climate change highlights a growing sense of China\u2019s international responsibility, and the country\u2019s evolving calculus towards taking action on the issue. \u201cAs Trump drops Obama\u2019s climate legacy, Xi might well establish one of his own. 2017 presents a real opportunity for China to rise to the challenge of responsible climate leadership. Having moved from climate villain to a reluctant leader in five short years over the first half of this decade, it\u2019s reasonable to expect China to become a true leader by its end.\u201d Davos: the best quotes from day one Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P, on trade wars \u201cIf you did go into a trade ice age, who would be better placed to survive it, economically? I think the answer is the US, because the US is a very large economy, resource rich, with a very large population. China has got more to lose ... But it\u2019s not clear that Trump has the upper hand. You\u2019ve got the mid-term elections in two years. If it\u2019s like \u2018oh my God this guy screwed up\u2019, he\u2019s on a short fuse.\u201d US secretary of state John Kerry, on the Iran nuclear deal \u201cTake Iran. If the US were to decide suddenly that we\u2019re not going to pursue this, I bet you that our friends and allies who negotiated this with us will get together, and Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain will say \u2018this is a good deal, we\u2019re going to keep it\u2019. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll have done a great injury to ourselves. \u201cThere are now no longer 19,000 centrifuges spinning and enriching, there are 5,000, which is the agreement. \u201cThere is no longer a 12,000 kg stockpile that could produce 10 to 12 bombs. There\u2019s 300kg, measurable every day. And you can\u2019t build a bomb with 300kg.\u201d Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, on globalisation \u2018Someone\u2019s got to make the counterargument for \u2018What has globalisation ever done for us?\u2019. \u201cThe benefits of globalisation in terms of more competition, better productivity, the fact that medium incomes haven\u2019t moved as much as people thought they might, but those medium incomes are buying a great deal more because of the benefits of globalisation in terms of the cost of imported goods. \u201cThe fact that the world\u2019s a healthier place than it was before.\u201d John Nelson, chairman of Lloyds of London, on Brexit \u201cWe\u2019ve had all the arguments about the various options. We are leaving. We\u2019ve got to get used to it. Let\u2019s get cracking. The sooner we get negotiations going the better. We need decisions at the top. \u201cWe need to make the best of it. It doesn\u2019t make sense to discriminate against the UK as a punishment. \u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s interests to have as much free trade as possible. But I don\u2019t expect a special deal.\u201d Matt Damon on raising money for his Water.org charity \u201cWe\u2019ve tried humour. A few years ago I went on a toilet strike for an entire year. \u201cOne of the first hurdles we\u2019ve had to clear in the west is that it\u2019s very hard for people to relate to this issue. If you grew up in Europe, if you grew up in America, you\u2019ve never been thirsty in your entire life and you\u2019ve never been five metres away from a clean drink water. \u201cThe water in our toilet is cleaner than the [drinking] water that 663m people have access to.\u201d Shakira on building schools in Columbia \u201cSometimes we encounter a tremendous lack of infrastructure. No potable water in many cases, no electricity, no paved roads, so it definitely means that we have to work twice as hard in order to offer a quality education. \u201cNot only that, but many of the children concerned are affected by violence or have lost family members.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook is to fly almost 1,000 UK customers out of the Gambia, following a change in Foreign Office advice due to unrest in the country. The west African nation has become a political battleground following presidential elections last month, with incumbent leader Yahya Jammeh unwilling to hand over power to the winner in the polls, Adama Barrow. In response, the UK Foreign Office (FCO) are now advising against all but essential travel to the Gambia, citing the \u201cdeteriorating political situation and potential military intervention following the presidential elections on 1 December\u201d. In the latest of a series of attempts to retain power, a 90-day state of emergency was declared by Jammeh on Tuesday, two days before he is due to leave office. In a televised announcement he said he was making the order \u201cto prevent a constitutional crisis and power vacuum\u201d, and that security forces were instructed to \u201cmaintain absolute peace, law and order\u201d. Thousands of Gambians have reportedly been leaving the country in fear of the situation deteriorating. \u201cThey\u2019re worried there might be war,\u201d said one Gambian immigration official. As well as implementing their contingency plan to bring all 985 UK customers they currently have on holiday in the Gambia home, Thomas Cook have also cancelled all flights to the Gambia until Friday 20 January. They will be running four additional flights on Wednesday 18 January and are contacting approximately 2,500 of their flight-only customers in the Gambia, to give them the option of early flights to the UK. In a statement, they said: \u201cWe are dispatching a special assistance team with our first flight from the UK to provide additional support at Banjul airport for our customers. Our colleagues on the ground in the Gambia will proactively contact all customers on holiday with us as soon as possible to prepare for return to the UK.\u201d The FCO have advised tourists: \u201cThe potential for military intervention and civil disturbance is high and could result in Banjul International Airport being closed at short notice. \u201cYou should follow events closely, take extra care, keep in regular contact with your tour operator and airline and continue to monitor travel advice and social media updates in case tensions rise as the current political deadlock continues.\u201d",
