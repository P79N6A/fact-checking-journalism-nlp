      "bodyText": "You want me to stay for an extra three years? I\u2019ll do one more and then I\u2019m off. Mark Carney\u2019s decision to leave the Bank of England in 2019 looks to be a straightforward snub to Theresa May. Earlier on Monday, the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman described the governor as \u201cabsolutely\u201d the best person for the job, which is the sort of thing you say if you think he\u2019ll do the full eight-year term. But he\u2019s doing six. Yes, it\u2019s one more year than was signalled back at his appointment, but it is not the full deal. Those angry Tory Brexiters who have been making mischief at Carney\u2019s expense for the past month will count this result as a victory for them. May has played this saga terribly. The Brexiters\u2019 grumbles about Carney\u2019s pre-EU referendum comments were fading from most people\u2019s memories before she breathed new life into the soap opera in her speech to the Conservative party conference a month ago. She complained about the \u201cbad side-effects\u201d of low interest rates and quantitative easing, and said \u201ca change has got to come\u201d. What sort of change? She didn\u2019t say, but suddenly it was open season on Carney. The Brexiters who resented Carney\u2019s comments that leaving the EU would be the \u201cbiggest domestic risk to financial stability\u201d popped up to denounce the governor and all his works. Michael Gove said Carney should learn some humility. Nigel Lawson thought he should resign. If he must stay, said the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, Carney should know his place. \u201cIt\u2019s important to comport yourself as a quiet and discreet public servant,\u201d he said. William Hague was a rarity in being a remainer, but he filled in May\u2019s blank about the possible form of change. Central bankers had lost the plot in their addiction to low interest rates, Hague argued, and \u201cthe era of their much-vaunted independence will come, possibly quite dramatically, to its end\u201d. Would those voices have been so emboldened had May not spoken? It\u2019s hard to say, but the chorus line has been an extraordinary spectacle. Senior politicians, even those who are years out of office, are normally wary of treading on the Bank\u2019s operational independence. Suddenly, the criticisms were personal \u2013 Hague excepted \u2013 but also woefully vague about alternative monetary prescriptions. Does anybody seriously believe the UK economy would be in better shape if only interest rates had been, say, 3% for the past few years? May, we were told after the conference speech, did not mean to question the Bank\u2019s independence and was merely expressing sympathy with savers. She should learn to take care. Her words provoked a pointless row about central bank independence and she ended up begging Carney to stay. In the event, the governor has agreed the shortest possible extension. He has had the last laugh while May\u2019s handling looks amateurish. Clara Furse: from bailed-out director to HSBC UK chair Former director of bailed-out bank to chair of HSBC UK. That is probably not how Clara Furse\u2019s appointment will be announced, but it would be accurate. Furse was a non-executive director of Belgian bank Fortis when, in partnership with Royal Bank of Scotland, it did the disastrous top-of-the-market purchase of ABN Amro in 2008. As with RBS, a state-sponsored rescue for Fortis followed. Furse, a former successful chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, was rehabilitated via a stint on the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee. All the same, chairing HSBC\u2019s ringfenced division in the UK is a big job. If Fortis had been British, would she be deemed suitable by the regulators? It\u2019s hard to think so. Tesco\u2019s \u00a3100m damages claim may not be so damaging A group of 124 British institutional funds want to be paid at least \u00a3100m in damages by Tesco. The poor souls feel terribly misled by the supermarket\u2019s overstatement of profits a couple of years ago and are calling for their investors to be compensated for the subsequent fall in the share price. That, at least, is the official explanation for filing a claim in the high court, courtesy of Bentham Europe, a group that funds such legal actions. Some of the fund managers may indeed be driven by the righteous sense that investors \u201chave a right to rely on statements made by companies to ensure that they correctly allocate capital\u201d, as Bentham\u2019s Jeremy Marshall puts it. But more than a few, one suspects, aren\u2019t terribly interested in US-style litigation and would be happy to take the rough with the smooth, if only everybody else would. They may be participating solely because they fear missing out if Tesco ends up having to write a cheque. Last year, Tesco settled a similar class action in the US for a fraction of the value of the initial claim. In the latest case, the supermarket could try offering the litigants, say, \u00a310m for their nuisance value and see if their heart is really in it.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a long old day, and quite a dramatic one as Mark Carney\u2019s future came to a head faster than most experts expected. No-one really predicted that the BoE governor would split the difference between his fans, and his critics, and plump to do an extra 12 months duty at Threadneedle Street. That\u2019s why the decision has been greeted fairly calmly, with the government insisting it\u2019s good news, but businesses understandably concerned about what happens in 2019. Sir Martin Sorrell probably spoke for many business leaders when he said it was \u2018a pity\u2019 that Carney wouldn\u2019t be at the helm until 2021. Whatever you think about the European Union, there\u2019s an argument that it\u2019s better not to change central bank governors in the middle of the Brexit negotiations. Now, the Treasury has almost three years to find the perfect candidate to replace Carney on 1 July 2019 and help steer Britain into its post-EU future. The immediate reaction from the City is still quite positive, with the pound up 0.6 of a cent at $1.2245. We\u2019ll may find out one day how hard Theresa May fought to keep Carney, or whether this compromise really suits all parties. We may also find out whether the governor still has serious political ambitions back in Canada. Several commentators, including Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward, have suggested he has an eye on the next federal elections, which are due in late 2019.... With that, I\u2019m wrapping up for the night. Larry Elliott\u2019s full story on Carney\u2019s decision is now live. Here\u2019s a flavour: Mark Carney to serve extra year as Bank of England governor Mark Carney has ended weeks of speculation about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England until Brexit negotiations with the EU have ended in 2019. Despite being urged by the prime minister, Theresa May, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to serve a full eight-year term at Threadneedle Street, until 2021, Carney said he would only agree to remain in place for an extra year. Hestarted in the job in July 2013. The governor said in a letter to Hammond that he had intended to leave the Bank for personal reasons after five years, but the altered landscape for the UK following the vote in June to leave the EU had caused him to change his mind..... Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Elizabeth Martins, an economist with HSBC, has dubbed Carney\u2019s decision a halfway house (which is a relief, as I plumped for that term earlier :) ). She says: \u201cI guess that markets would have liked to see a 2021 extension, and expected it given indications in the media. But this will go down better than an earlier departure.\u201d (that\u2019s via Reuters) And Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight has given the news \u201ctwo cheers out of three\u201d, and suggests Carney\u2019s detractors should rein themselves in: Now that Mr. Carney has made his intentions clear, it is to be hoped that everyone gives the Governor maximum support, including his critics. The UK faces a very challenging period ahead which will be demanding for all policymakers. Matters will not be helped by sniping at the Bank of England Governor or making statements that seemingly question at the Bank of England\u2019s independence Some Bank of England trivia, from Newnight\u2019s Lewis Goodall: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who clashed with Mark Carney at several parliamentary hearings, doesn\u2019t appear very happy with tonight\u2019s news. He told Reuters that: \u201cI think the uncertainty was bad, but I still think he ought to have gone because of his bias over Brexit.\u201d Some pro-Brexit Conservative MPs aren\u2019t best pleased that Mark Carney will remain at the Bank of England until 2019, says the City AM newspaper. One leading Tory brexiteer told them that: My sense is that if [Carney] is going to stay to 2019 he needs to find a way to row in behind the Prime Minister and start to find a way to be a bit more positive. I would like him to stay and do a good job, and demonstrate some enthusiasm for leaving the EU, seeing as we are going to. More here. Duncan Weldon, head of research at Resolution Group, suggests Mark Carney has played the game rather well.... Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is pleased that Mark Carney has decided his future. But he\u2019s also concerned that his replacement (whoever she or he is) will take over at a critical time: \u201dBusinesses want stability at a time of economic change, particularly at key institutions like the Bank of England. Firms will be reassured that the recent speculation over the timing and nature of Mark Carney\u2019s departure has been put to rest. However, the Governor will still be leaving at a sensitive time for the economy - so businesses will want to see a clear and ordered transition plan.\u201d An interesting reaction from Rupert Harrison of BlackRock, the asset manager. Harrison is a former advisor to George Osborne, who appointed Carney in the first place. British prime minister Theresa May has welcomes Mark Carney\u2019s decision to extend his term at the Bank of England by one year. May\u2019s spokeswoman says (via Reuters). \u201cThe prime minister welcomes the governor\u2019s decision to stay on beyond his initial five-year term. This is good news for the UK. It will provide continuity and stability at the Bank of England as we negotiate our exit from the European Union and look to take advantage of the opportunities that Brexit will present.\u201d However, there\u2019s no word on whether May would rather Carney had stayed until 2021. Zing! Andrew Tyrie, the influential chair of parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee, is determined to find out why Mark Carney is only going to serve a six year term. And he\u2019s promising to ask the governor a lot of searching questions when they next face each other.... The much needed clarification is welcome. The less uncertainty the better. Still, the Treasury Committee concluded in November 2011 that a non-renewable term of 8 years for the post of Governor was appropriate. The Government agreed, and changed the law in the Financial Services Act 2012, in line with the recommendation. In making this announcement, the Government and the Governor are sticking neither to the timetable set out in the exchange of letters, nor returning to the statute. More uncertainty needs to be avoided. So the decision requires a good deal of examination and explanation, which the Committee will seek when it next sees the Governor in a fortnight. The CBI\u2019s principal economist, Alpesh Paleja, says Carney has given us a Halloween treat: Sir Martin Sorrell, head of advertising giant WPP, is disappointed that Carney won\u2019t stay on until 2021. Sorrell told Sky News that \u201cone year is better than nothing... but it\u2019s disappointing that he won\u2019t serve his full term.\u201d \u201cMaybe he was a little bit bruised by the criticism, I think unjustified criticism, that he\u2019s been subjected to,\u201d Sorrell said. Sorrell also warned that it will be \u201ctouch and go\u201d as to whether the UK has finished the Brexit negotiations by June 2019. Chris Chapman, a London-based trader at Manulife Asset Management, has told Bloomberg that the City ought to welcome Carney\u2019s decision: \u201cCarney is a respected central banker and overall I\u2019d say that him staying with the BOE until 2019 would be seen as a positive for the country, but again, near term there are so many other factors weighing on the pound. Grant Lewis, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets, tweets that Mark Carney is doing Britain a favour: While James Mackintosh of the Wall Street Journal says Carney\u2019s departure is well-timed. Sterling has rallied a little following Mark Carney\u2019s announcement. The pound is up half a cent against the US dollar at $1.224. It\u2019s up a similar amount against the euro, at \u20ac1.115. These are small gains, but not enough to stop sterling being the worst-performing major currency this month [it lost 6% in October, after Theresa May announced she would trigger article 50 by March 2017, and prioritise migration control] Ed Conway is two steps ahead of us in the game of fantasy central bank governors: Sky News\u2019s Dharshini David says Carney has made a sensible decision by staying on for an extra 12 months. Kate Devlin of The Herald points out that Downing Street\u2019s charm offensive this morning didn\u2019t persuade Carney to do three more years: ITV\u2019s Chris Ship wonders if Mark Carney has half an eye on Canadian politics.... Mark Carney has surprised pretty much everyone by deciding that he\u2019ll hang around at the Bank of England for another 12 months, until June 2019. It feels like a halfway-house decision, which will disappoint those who hoped he\u2019d stay until 2012. But it may also placate some of his Brexit-supporting critics; as Carney will depart shortly after Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is completed (assuming Theresa May starts the process in March 2017, as planned). Philip Hammond has sent a rather short reply to Mark Carney. In it, the chancellor says he is \u201cvery pleased\u201d that he will continue as Bank of England governor until June 2019, to provide \u201chighly effective leadership\u201d during this critical time. Here\u2019s the full letter which Mark Carney sent to chancellor Philip Hammond tonight, saying he would be \u201chonoured to extend my time of service as Governor for an additional year to the end of June 2019.\u201d BREAKING NEWS: Mark Carney has decided to staying on as Bank of England governor for another year. The Bank of England has just announced that Carney will remain in post until the end of June 2019, 12 months longer than originally planned. But crucially, Carney is not taking up the option of three more years -- despite Theresa May\u2019s vote of confidence today. Carney says this extra 12 months should cover the period over which Britain leaves the European Union, and will help \u201csecure an orderly transition\u201d to the UK\u2019s new relationship with Europe. More to follow! If you\u2019re just tuning in, I\u2019d better explain that the question on the City of London\u2019s collective mind is whether Mark Carney decides to stay on at the Bank of England until 2021. Under his original contract, he is due to leave in the summer of 2018, but he has the option to stick in the job for another three years. Some pro-Brexit politicians have heaped heavy criticism on Carney, saying he was discredited for being unduly pessimistic about leaving the EU. But earlier today, Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman gave him a resounding endorsement, saying: \u201cIt is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years. The PM has always had a good working relationship with the governor of the Bank of England and intends to continue that.\u201d Carney and May then spoke for around an hour and a half today. We\u2019re also hearing that a decision on Mark Carney\u2019s future could come this evening.... Investors would probably be reassured if Mark Carney announces he\u2019ll stay at the Bank of England for another three years. This is from Reuters\u2019 latest update on the governor: The career plans of a man once dubbed the \u201coutstanding central banker of his generation\u201d have gripped financial markets. Some of the recent slide in sterling and rise in government bond yields have been attributed by analysts to the prospect of Carney leaving the BoE. \u201cIf Carney was to stay until 2021 that would somewhat reassure markets,\u201d said Hetal Mehta, senior European economist with Legal &amp; General Investment Management. \u201cIt would be really unwelcome for (finance minister) Philip Hammond to have to find someone new over the course of next year when he will have a million and one other things to worry about.\u201d While we wait for developments, here\u2019s a video clip of Mark Carney responding to an MP\u2019s question: Danny Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policymaker, has warned that Mark Carney is the main defence between Britain and chaos. Writing in the Guardian tonight, Blanchflower says: Mark Carney is unequivocally not responsible for the slowing of the UK economy or the fall in the pound. Quite the contrary, he almost single-handedly turned around a potential collapse in output and sentiment in the days after the EU referendum on 23 June. Far from harming Britain, Carney has been the country\u2019s saviour. I have criticised the Bank of England governor rather harshly in the past, especially for his claim in August 2015, that \u201csustained momentum\u201d in the UK economy and rising inflation would \u201clikely put the decision as to when to start the process of gradual monetary policy normalisation into sharper relief around the turn of this year\u201d. That didn\u2019t happen. But I have changed my mind. Right now we all need to stand behind Carney for the good of the country. Without him, chaos reigns. Here\u2019s the full piece. We could get an announcement from the Bank of England tonight, according to Jason Groves of the Daily Mail. That\u2019s not official, though -- so hopefully it won\u2019t interfere with anyone\u2019s trick or treating.... Over at the Oxford Union, the US treasury secretary is educating students about the problems in the global economy. Jack Lew is running through a familiar litany of problems -- from corporate tax avoidance to worries about migration, and the rise of popularism among those who feel they\u2019re getting an unfair deal. Our economics reporter Katie Allen is tweeting the key points: Hopefully one of the students will ask Lew why the government he\u2019s served in hasn\u2019t managed to tackle these problems... That \u2018pop\u2019 in the pound a few minutes ago may simply be due to trading around the 4pm fix - when the value of the pound is recorded each day, City traders tell me. Today\u2019s fix may be more volatile as it is the final reading of the month, so investors may be rebalancing their portfolios. Here\u2019s an explanation of The Fix. Here\u2019s the official (no) comment from Downing Street about today\u2019s meeting between Theresa May and Mark Carney. \u201cThis was a scheduled, planned meeting that had been in the diary for a while. I\u2019m not going to go into the details of the discussions.\u201d Curiously, the pound just jumped by half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.2217. It\u2019s also up half a percent against the euro, to \u20ac1.114. It\u2019s not clear what sparked this mini rally, or whether it will last. Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman won\u2019t say how the meeting with Mark Carney went, alas. The long-term value of the pound will be determined by the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU and the trade deals it secures, not the identity of the Bank of England governor. So argues Neil Wilson of City trading firm ETX Capital, who says Carney\u2019s future shouldn\u2019t distract from the fundamental issues affecting the UK economy. He writes: Investors are selling the pound for a variety of reasons and the whole Carney saga doesn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans for the currency.... Sterling was the worst performing currency in October, having had its worst month since June, which has more to do with \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 talk since the Tory party conference than speculation over Mr Carney\u2019s future. For sterling what really matters is how Britain handles the Brexit process and what direction Theresa May and co plan to take the country in the coming months before invoking Article 50. The chief drivers of the pound value now are political, not which city Mr Carney chooses to live in. (Also if the economy continues to hold up well into next year we could see sterling crank higher.) And while Mr Carney provides continuity and reassurance, it\u2019s hard to see him doing an awful lot between now and 2018 that would be different to any other central banker.\u201d Even the satirists are having their say: Unless we get a late rally tonight, the pound is going to rack up its worst month since June - having dropped by over 6% in October. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, says the uncertainty over Mark Carney\u2019s future has weighed on sterling. \u201cThe talk of Carney not taking up the extra three years after 2018 has rattled investors in what is a very uncertain outlook. Until his decision to stay on is formally acknowledged,markets are correct in treating the situation as uncertain.\u201d Carney also waved what looked like an A4 leather binder towards the press pack as he exited Number 10 a few minutes ago: Here you go -- photos of Mark Carney leaving his meeting with Theresa May - with a shy smile for the cameras (but no words, alas) Mark Carney has just left his meeting with Theresa May, according to Sky\u2019s Ed Conway. No news on his future yet, though.... Mark Carney hasn\u2019t been slack at the BoE. Since joining in summer 2013 he\u2019s: Launched a new policy of \u2018forward guidance\u2019 on interest rates, changed it, and now put it on the backburner while Brexit plays out. Kept interest rates on record lows for years, and then cut them to just 0.25% after the referendum Shaken up the Bank of England, by holding open days for the public to have their say Launched Britain\u2019s first plastic banknotes (and dipped one in a pot of curry] Made a series of warnings about the dangers of Brexit before June 23, and had to justify them ever since. Our timeline has the full story: Mark Carney has long been rumoured to fancy a career in politics. And recent events suggests he may have a fine grasp of the dark arts of political spin. The Telegraph\u2019s James Kirkup argues that Carney has played a blinder this month, by using the attacks from Brexit supporters to spark a debate about his future. The key to the saga is Carney\u2019s declaration last week that his decision on whether to stay or go in 2018 was \u201centirely personal\u201d. That sent the hare running.... and it got a second burst of speed when various Carney \u2018friends\u2019 suggested he was leaning towards a return to Canada. Kirkup explains how Carney outfoxed his detractors within Theresa May\u2019s government: Before the row over his ideological commitment to Brexit blew up, there was a perfectly respectable question to be asked about Mr Carney\u2019s future based on his competence as a central banker. Some of his policies, especially \u201cforward guidance\u201d about rates, have been less than impressive, leading to confusion instead of the clarity he promised. But the Carney-bashers have allowed that debate to shift from economics into politics, an arena where Mr Carney does rather well. He understood that Mrs May could not afford to have markets and investors (and even some voters) see Brexit Britain as the sort of country where the central bank governor can be purged for failing to pass a political purity test. Simply, it might (just) have been viable to let Mr Carney go for being incompetent, but it wasn\u2019t sensible to do so for reasons of politics. The Governor saw that and upped the ante accordingly: he could afford to walk away; could Britain afford to have him go? Here\u2019s our latest news story on Mark Carney\u2019s future, by economics editor Larry Elliott: Right, let\u2019s quickly recap before Mark Carney emerges from his meeting at Number 10 Downing Street. The future of Britain\u2019s central bank chief could be decided soon, following a weekend of speculation that has gripped the City. Mark Carney is meeting with Theresa May now, less than a day after the Financial Times reported that he was ready to serve another three years as Bank of England governor. Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has already signalled that the government backs Carney, following several days of criticism from politicians who campaigned for Brexit. The spokeswoman said that Carney was \u201cabsolutely\u201d the right man to run the BoE, saying: The PM has been clear in her support for the governor, the work he is doing for the country. It is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years. The PM has always had a good working relationship with the governor of the Bank of England and intends to continue that. As things stand, Carney\u2019s current contract expires in the summer of 2018, but he has the option of a three-year extension. A string of City investors and economists have argued that Carney should stay on, to provide stability at this time. Prominent voices today include Hendrik Du Toit, the chief executive of Investec Asset Management, former BoE policymaker Adam Posen, and Lothar Mentel, CIO of Tatton Investment Management. But Carney\u2019s critics insist that the governor\u2019s reputation has been damaged by his comments in the run-up to June\u2019s referendum, and his actions since. Daniel Hannan, the MEP who played a key role making Brexit a reality, said Carney has made mistakes at the Bank - and needed to stop acting like a politician. He told the Today Programme that: If he does stay, it\u2019s on the basis that he\u2019s not the rockstar banker who presumes to tell Scotland how to vote, and [instead he] stays narrowly to his brief. Two Conservative MPs, Nicholas Soames and Anna Soubry, also publicly backed Carney this morning. But the pound remains under pressure, and is now down 0.2% at $1.216. Traders say that the criticism of Carney may have undermined the Bank of England\u2019s independence, even if he does decide to stay on until 2021. Mark Carney has arrived at Downing Street, and is meeting with Theresa May right now... just a couple of hours after the PM offered the governor her full support. Could an announcement on his future come today?.... This uncertainty over Mark Carney\u2019s future has come at a bad time, says Costas Milas, professor of finance at the University of Liverpool, in a new blog post. With Britain probably entering a \u201cincreasing economic uncertainty\u201d, the governor needs to reassure himself that he has Downing Street\u2019s full support, before deciding whether to extend his tenure until 2012. Milas writes: One of the unwritten rules of football is never substitute a player \u2013 let alone your captain \u2013 when defending a corner. Indeed, with Brexit headwinds moving fast(?) our way, this is not the time to replace the Governor. Mark Carney himself should seek reassurances of no further \u2018foul play\u2019 by the government so that he confirms his Governorship until 2021. Unless, of course, government officials have already found a \u2018suitable\u2019 replacement. But then again, would another candidate be willing to risk their reputation on such a demanding job knowing, or at least suspecting, that their predecessor decided to step down partly because of rising tensions and/or interference by government officials? The pound continues to dip, and is now down 0.2% today at $1.215. October really has been a rough month for sterling. It ended September worth nearly $1.30, but began sliding once Theresa May indicated Britain was heading for a hard Brexit. The pound has now lost over 6.3% during the month, making it the worst performing currency... Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch fear that the row over Mark Carney\u2019s future may have caused long-term damage to Britain\u2019s reputation in the markets. They suspect international investors may still be wary of UK assets, even if the governor announces he\u2019ll stay on until 2021. They say: At this stage we are not sure even Carney extending his contract would eliminate the extra policy uncertainty: it may be tricky to undo the impression markets have already formed. That\u2019s via fastFT: You might expect the pound to have rallied on the back of Theresa May\u2019s show of support for Mark Carney. But actually, sterling is still flat today at $1.2170. I don\u2019t think that means traders aren\u2019t interested in who runs the Bank of England, though. Instead, they\u2019re probably waiting for firm news, and also a little alarmed that an independent central bank governor could have faced a campaign to drive him out. With Theresa May\u2019s vote of confidence in the bag, could Mark Carney announce later today that he\u2019d like to serve a full term at the Bank of England? Sam Coates of The Times reckons the story could now move fast.... The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports that Mark Carney is due to meet the prime minister today, but it\u2019s been in the diary for a while..... Theresa May has just slapped down critics of Mark Carney, such as Dan Hannan, says the Sun\u2019s political editor Tom Newton Dunn: Newsflash from Downing Street: Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has just given Mark Carney a resounding vote of confidence. The Prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman has told Westminster reporters that May is \u2018clear in her support\u2019 for governor Carney, and the work he is doing for the country. And May would also support Carney if he decided to extend his original contract, and stay at the BoE until 2021 (rather than leaving in 2018, as originally planned). But the governor must decide if he wants to do an extra three years. The spokeswoman says: The PM has been clear in her support for the governor, the work he is doing for the country. It is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years. The PM has always had a good working relationship with the governor of the Bank of England and intends to continue that. ITV\u2019s Chris Ship tweets from the Lobby: And asked if Carney was the best man for the job, the spokeswoman said: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Huffington Post\u2019s Paul Waugh says it\u2019s a significant intervention (following weekend reports that Carney might announce his departure date this week). Political and economic journalist Iain Martin has written a good piece about the Carney saga. He points out that our governor is not above criticism. Carney can appear somewhat thin-skinned when his judgement is questioned (a not-uncommon Achilles heel among central bankers, frankly). But still \u2013 undermining the Bank of England governor is a serious business. Especially when we\u2019ve also seen cabinet leaks undermining chancellor Philip Hammond (for being too pessimistic about Brexit). Martin says this is the equivalent of playing with matches in a petrol station, at a time when the government should be reassuring the financial markets: We\u2019re in ravens at the Tower of London territory here with Carney and Hammond. What they symbolise via the authority of their respective offices is stability, relative calm and continuity. Perception and confidence matters, a lot. Tories used to have a better feel for the realities of markets, back when many of them had worked in the City. Now, they seem to think a war on Carney is simply an extension of the Brexit campaign. It is to his credit if he has decided to leave this recent mess in the past and get on with helping guide Britain through Brexit. Just in... America\u2019s Treasury Secretary has met with top bankers in London, and told them the US hopes to see a \u2018smooth\u2019 Brexit process. Jack Lew also argued that politicians need to use government spending (fiscal policy) to boost growth, rather than simply relying on loose monetary policy (low interest rates). Here\u2019s the official \u2018readout\u2019 from the US Treasury office. During the conversation, Secretary Lew underscored the United States is committed to continuing to work with the UK and the EU to ensure sustained economic stability and shared, global prosperity as the UK and the EU negotiate their future economic relationship. The Secretary reiterated that a transparent, smooth and cooperative process that results in a highly integrated economic relationship is in the best interests of Europe, the United States, and the global economy. Secretary Lew added that the United States remains committed to maintaining its Special Relationship with the UK and its strong partnership with the EU. Secretary Lew noted that U.S. economic growth remains solid in the face of headwinds from the global economy. The Secretary added that, looking forward, it is important that leaders make robust use of all policy levers \u2013monetary, fiscal, and structural \u2013 to achieve strong, sustainable, and balanced growth and to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared inclusively within countries. Lew met with Jes Staley (CEO of Barclays), Bill Winters (CEO of Standard Chartered), Xavier Rolet (CEO of the London Stock Exchange), James Cowles (EMEA chief at Citigroup), Mark Gavin (European chairman of JPMorganChase), and Gary Campkin (director of TheCityUK). Mark Carney\u2019s future is becoming a litmus test of the Bank of England\u2019s independence, says the Reuters Breaking Views team: Back in 2012, chancellor George Osborne described Mark Carney as \u201cthe outstanding central banker of his generation\u201d, as he announced his appointment to the Bank of England. Historians may make a stronger case for the ECB\u2019s Mario Draghi (who also has a habit of upsetting politicians), but at the time, Carney\u2019s appointment was pretty well received. Indeed, even arch-critic Dan Hannan hailed the move on Twitter:.... US economist Adam Posen fears that the attacks on Mark Carney will damage the whole concept of Bank of England independence: He tweets: Posen is a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, who now runs the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Newsflash: The eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2016. That\u2019s in line with forecasts, and matches the 0.3% growth in the April-to-June quarter. European politicians will be pleased that growth didn\u2019t weaken following the UK\u2019s brexit vote. But it\u2019s still a lacklustre recovery; too slow to drag down the unemployment total. Just in! The number of mortgages approved by UK banks has jumped to their highest level since the EU referendum. Mortgage approvals for house purchases rose to 62,932 in September from 60,984 in August, according to new data from the Bank of England. That\u2019s the highest since June, beating City forecasts of a decline to 60,150. It\u2019s the latest sign that Britain\u2019s economy isn\u2019t falling into recession, following last week\u2019s GDP figures (which showed growth of 0.5% in the last quarter). Mark Carney\u2019s supporters could argue that this vindicates his decision to ease monetary policy after the referendum. His opponents, though, could claim that it simply shows he was simply too alarmist and pessimistic about Brexit. Without a \u2018counterfactual\u2019 (an alternative universe where Carney takes a monastic silence in the run-up to the vote, and cowers in his office afterwards), we\u2019ll never know for sure.... Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Societe Generale, says the speculation that Carney would extend his term until 2021 is preventing the pound sliding today. The FT reports that BOE Governor Mark Carney has told friends he is planning to stay on for his full term. That\u2019s stopped the rot for sterling, for now. Hendrik Du Toit, the chief executive of Investec Asset Management, has just thrown his weight behind the governor: The speculation over Mark Carney\u2019s future began nearly four weeks ago, when prime minister Theresa May criticised the Bank for keeping interest rates so low. That intervention, during May\u2019s speech to her party conference, appears to have opened the door for Brexit supporters to take a pop at the governor. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services argues that the spat doesn\u2019t reflect well on the government: The stench of UK Conservative Party internecine warfare hangs over Bank of England governor Carney, serving as a reminder why Mrs May once called the Conservative Party the \u2018nasty\u2019 party. Economist Vicky Pryce, of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, has also defended Carney, arguing that his critics are effectively \u201ccriticising the Bank\u2019s independence.\u201d She reminded the Today Programme that the BoE helped to stabilise the economy after the EU referendum: \u201cMark Carney was absolutely right to be prepared to do something about Brexit. The economy wouldn\u2019t be growing anything like as fast as it is if it wasn\u2019t for his very immediate intervention in the markets.\u201d (that\u2019s via the Independent) Reminder: the Bank of England provided more liquidity to banks in June, and then cut interest rates and boosted QE in August. Two Conservative MPs have rallied to Mark Carney\u2019s side. Sir Nicholas Soames hit out at the governor\u2019s critics, such as Dan Hannan, accusing them of undermining the UK. Soames also tweeted yesterday: Fellow Tory Anna Soubry has also criticised Hannan this morning, over his comments on Radio Four today. Dan Hannan MEP, one of Mark Carney\u2019s most robust critics, says the governor needs to behave better if he stays on at the Bank of England. He was speaking on that Today Programme this morning. Q: What would you say to Carney, as he decides whether to leave in 2018 or stay until 2021? I\u2019d say that if you do stay, it\u2019s important to comport yourself as a quiet and discreet public servant who errs on the side of saying too little. Q: But you\u2019d like him to resign? Umm. It\u2019s up to him. But if he does stay, it\u2019s on the basis that he\u2019s not the rockstar banker who presumes to tell Scotland how to vote, and [instead he] stays narrowly to his brief. Hannan then argues that Carney has brought the current spat on himself, by violating the independence of the BoE. If you\u2019re going to engage in straight-forward political argument, and have views that eerily echo the chancellor who appointed you, you can\u2019t then argue if you get criticised. Hannan claims his criticism isn\u2019t personal - saying Carney did a \u2018pretty good job\u2019 when he was governor of the Bank of Canada. But then he puts the knife in, saying: As a matter of observable fact, he has tended to get things wrong. He cites Carney\u2019s famous \u2018forward guidance\u2019, when he said he\u2019d consider raising interest rates when unemployment fell to 7%, then when real wages started to rise, but he never did.\u2019 He said during the campaign that if we voted leave, unemployment would rise and the economy would stall As a matter of observable fact, unemployment has fallen since the vote and the economy expanded by 0.5% since the vote. Sir Martin Sorrell, the boss of advertising giant WPP, has revealed he wants Mark Carney to remain at the BoE. He told the BBC Breakfast that the governor has handled the aftermath of the EU referendum well: If Mark Carney stays as Bank of England governor, which I really hope he will do, that will help. His prompt action post the Brexit vote I think softened the blow of Brexit. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of leading shares has dipped in early trading, down 25 points at 6972. There\u2019s nervousness ahead of the US presidential election, especially given the new FBI inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, as well as chatter about Mark Carney. And the oil price is also down, with Brent crude dropping 0.5% to $49.53 after a group of non-Opec members didn\u2019t agree any production cuts at a weekend meeting. Sterling could strengthen if Mark Carney commits to serve a full eight year term at the Bank of England, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index She says: The US election saga has been garnering all of the headlines this weekend until one popped up from the FT, which is reporting that Mark Carney is willing to serve an 8-year term at the BOE. This is big news for UK assets, the pound had a mini pop higher during the Asian session, but there could be more to come. If this story is true, then it is a beacon of stability during a period of uncertainty for the UK economy, which should benefit the currency and stocks alike. Brooks reckons the pound could rally back toward $1.25. But she also reminds us that Carney was once dubbed an \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019, after rejigging his \u2018forward guidance\u2019 on when he\u2019d raise interest rates. We need confirmation from the BOE that he is staying before we get too giddy with excitement that the \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d has finally committed to the Old Lady*. * - that\u2019s the \u2018Old Lady of Threadneedle Street\u2019; an old nickname for the BoE The pound jumped back over the $1.22 mark overnight after the Financial Times reported that Mark Carney was \u2018ready to serve\u2019 until 2021. It\u2019s now dipped a little, to around $1.219, as investors await fresh developments. IHS\u2019s chief economist, Howard Archer, believes Carney needs to put an end to this speculation soon: The Daily Telegraph\u2019s international business editor, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, argues that Britain needs Mark Carney right now: Kleinwort Benson\u2019s chief investment officer, Mouhammed Choukeir, also believes the City wouldn\u2019t be happy if governor Carney quit in 2018. He tells Bloomberg TV that: If Carney were to leave right now, it would add another level of uncertainty\u2026.which the market is trying to avoid right now. Q: But hasn\u2019t Carney\u2019s credibility been damaged by his warnings ahead of the Brexit vote? Choukeir argues that Carney was actually doing the \u2018prudent\u2019 thing, but this has now turned into a political debate. Lothar Mentel, CIO of Tatton Investment Management, says investors would be very concerned if Mark Carney chooses to leave the Bank of England in 2018. Carney is one of the \u201cstabilising factors\u201d we have in the UK, Mentel tells Bloomberg TV. He thinks the City would be reassured if the governor chooses to extend his term by three years, to 2021. Mentel says: If he decided to go that would be a very, very strong signal that there is not enough support from politicians.... I think the markets would take it quite negatively Mentel adds that the pound could take \u2018another leg down\u2019, and suffer new losses if Carney chose to walk away in two years. There\u2019s one main topic of conversation in the foggy streets of the City this morning; is Mark Carney going to be driven out by his opponents in the pro-Brexit camp? Yesterday, several UK newspapers reported that Carney was poised to turn down the option of staying at the Bank of England until 2021. Instead, he would simply leave the governorship in summer 2018, when his current five-year term ends. The Sunday Times, for example, declared that: Mark Carney may announce within days that he is to quit his job as governor of the Bank of England amid signs he has become a controversial figure in the post-Brexit debate. Senior City figures who know the governor said they believed it was more likely than not that he would choose to return to Canada in 2018, adding that his family\u2019s feelings were a concern. He has the option of leaving five years after his appointment, which was in July 2013, or staying for the full eight-year term. Suggestions that he could leave before 2018 were firmly rejected. Earlier this year, Carney suggested he could well stay on until 2021. But since then, he has faced steady, rising criticism from the Leave campaign, following his pre-referendum warnings that a Brexit vote could push the UK into an immediate recession. MEP Daniel Hannan, for example, argues that Carney should quit for having politicised the governorship. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and former chancellor Lord Lawson have also criticised him. But late last night, the Financial Times dramatically reported that Carney was \u201cready to serve\u201d a full eight-year term (assuming the government want him to, of course). The FT\u2019s Chris Giles says: Mr Carney is said to be leaning strongly towards staying in his post. He would like to help steer the UK economy through treacherous waters once the government triggers Article 50 in March 2017, starting a two-year clock on divorce negotiations with Brussels. \u201cMid-2018 could be the darkest days for the UK,\u201d said a person familiar with the governor\u2019s thinking. The issue is likely to dominate this week, as the Bank of England is presenting its quarterly inflation report on Thursday. Carney\u2019s press conference, at 12.30pm, will be unmissable... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The new week has started with some bad economic news from Germany. German retail sales have fallen at their fastest pace in two years, suggesting that consumer confidence in Europe\u2019s largest economy may be weakening. Retail sales slid by 1.4% in September, missing expectations of a 0.2% rise. That\u2019s a worrying sign, with Brexit continuing to cast a shadow over Europe. These retail sales figure can be volatile. But Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, thinks we should be concerned: The sentiment is very negative over in Europe and the economic data out of Germany made things even more worse. The retail sales data out of Germany was well below the expectations raising concerns about the domestic growth in the country. The retail sales data always tells us the story about the health of the economy That sets the scene for the main event of the morning; the eurozone GDP reading for the third quarter of 2016. It\u2019s due at 10am. Economists expect quarterly growth of 0.3%, which would count as \u2018steady but unspectacular\u2019. On Friday, we learned that France only grew by 0.2%, while Spain looked healthier with 0.7% growth. On the corporate front, advertising group WPP is reporting results. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

And recent events suggests he may have a fine grasp of the dark arts of political spin.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/31/mark-carney-hasnt-just-played-a-political-game-hes-won-it-hands/\">The Telegraph\u2019s James Kirkup argues</a> that Carney has played a blinder this month, by using the attacks from Brexit supporters to spark a debate about his future.</p> <p>The key to the saga is Carney\u2019s declaration last week that his decision on whether to stay or go in 2018 was \u201centirely personal\u201d. That sent the hare running.... and it got a second burst of speed when various Carney \u2018friends\u2019 suggested he was leaning towards a return to Canada.</p> <p>Kirkup explains how Carney outfoxed his detractors within Theresa May\u2019s government: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before the row over his ideological commitment to Brexit blew up, there was a perfectly respectable question to be asked about Mr Carney\u2019s future based on his competence as a central banker. Some of his policies, especially \u201cforward guidance\u201d about rates, have been less than impressive, leading to confusion instead of the clarity he promised.</p> <p>But the Carney-bashers have allowed that debate to shift from economics into politics, an arena where Mr Carney does rather well.

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has ended weeks of speculation about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England until Brexit negotiations with the EU have ended in 2019. Despite being urged by the prime minister, Theresa May, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to serve a full eight-year term at Threadneedle Street, until 2021, Carney said he would only agree to remain in place for an extra year. He started in the job in July 2013. The governor said in a letter to Hammond that he had intended to leave the Bank for personal reasons after five years, but the altered landscape for the UK following the vote in June to leave the EU had caused him to change his mind. \u201cSince then, my personal circumstances have not changed, but other circumstances clearly have, most notably the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRecognising the importance to the country of continuity during the UK\u2019s article 50 negotiations, and notwithstanding those personal circumstances, I would be honoured to extend my time of service as governor for an additional year to the end of June 2019. \u201cBy taking my term in office beyond the expected period of the article 50 process, this should help contribute to securing an orderly transition to the UK\u2019s new relationship with Europe.\u201d His announcement followed a meeting with May in which the prime minister gave the governor her full backing for his handling of interest rates and called on him to stay to help steer the UK economy through the post-Brexit vote period. The public show of support for Carney from the government\u2019s two leading figures reflected concerns that news of his early departure would put further downward pressure on an already weak pound. Sterling fell by 6% in October, during which it was the weakest of 150 global currencies tracked by Bloomberg. While May and Hammond will be disappointed that Carney has declined to stay on until 2021, they will be relieved that he is remaining at the Bank while the two-year article 50 talks are taking place. May has pledged to trigger article 50, beginning the process of the UK leaving the EU, by the end of March 2017. The pound rose by half a cent on foreign exchanges on Monday following the prime minister\u2019s show of support. May\u2019s spokeswoman said Carney\u2019s decision to stay on was good news for the UK and would provide continuity and stability while Britain negotiated its EU exit. However, Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said it needed \u201ca good deal of examination and explanation\u201d and that he would be questioning the governor at a meeting of the committee in a fortnight\u2019s time. Before the referendum, Carney said he would make a decision on whether to stay on at the Bank before the end of 2016, but he has been forced to make his intentions clear by a flurry of speculation about his future. This began when May used her speech at the Conservative party conference to question the \u201cbad side-effects\u201d of ultra-low interest rates and the Bank\u2019s money creation programme. Downing Street apologised to the Bank, insisting that May had not intended to attack the governor, but her comments prompted open criticism of Threadneedle Street and Carney from senior Conservative politicians including the former chancellor Lord Nigel Lawson, the former foreign secretary William Hague and the leading Brexit campaigner Michael Gove. His critics were unhappy at what they saw as the overpoliticisation of his role in the run-up to the EU referendum. They have also attacked the Bank\u2019s forecasting record and the ramifications of its seven-year stimulus programme. With rumours about Carney\u2019s future helping put pressure on sterling, Hammond publicly backed the governor and said he would be delighted if he stayed on until 2021. May\u2019s spokeswoman had made it apparent ahead of the announcement that the prime minister was also concerned Carney might stick to his original plan to leave after five years. \u201cThe PM has been clear in her support for the governor; the work he is doing for the country. It is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Asked whether May considered Carney to be the best person for the job, the spokeswoman said: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Responding to the news, Hammond wrote in his letter to Carney: \u201cI am very pleased to hear that you intend to continue as governor of the Bank of England until the end of June 2019. \u201cThis will enable you to continue your highly effective leadership of the Bank through a critical period for the British economy, as we negotiate our exit from the European Union.\u201d But Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of advertising company WPP, expressed disappointed that Carney would not be staying on until 2021. \u201cOne year is better than nothing ... But it\u2019s disappointing that he won\u2019t serve his full term,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cMaybe he was a little bit bruised by the criticism, I think unjustified criticism, that he\u2019s been subjected to.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Liberal democracy and free market capitalism are under threat unless governments do more to tackle inequality, the US Treasury secretary has warned on a visit to the UK. Jack Lew called for Britain and the EU to ensure their economies remain \u201chighly integrated\u201d when Britain leaves the bloc. He linked the vote for Brexit to a more general rise in anxiety among people over how economies have evolved and the \u201clopsided\u201d nature of gains. With just over a week to go to the US presidential election and against the backdrop of a tight race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Lew told an audience in Oxford that populism was on the rise in many countries, calling it \u201ca challenge in so many parts of the world right now\u201d. Lew told the Oxford Union debating society: \u201cClearly it was an issue during the vote here and the decision whether or not to remain part of the European Union. It\u2019s clearly a part of the elections taking place in the United States this year. And if you look around in Europe, it\u2019s part of elections in so many countries in Europe.\u201d He said people\u2019s worries about their economic situation and economic prospects stemmed from many sources, including technological changes and globalisation. \u201cIn the United States \u2013 and I would hazard to say that this is true here in the vote for Brexit \u2013 there is some anxiety that flows from the way that the modern economy has evolved that is looking for a solution,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t people feel good? They are looking at an economy that increasingly seems lopsided,\u201d he added, saying many workers who paid tax felt wronged by what they saw as a business tax system where \u201con the international side you see a whole lot of international firms organising themselves to avoid paying in some cases any taxes\u201d. The onus was on government to reform the tax system, to increase investment in people so that they have the right education and skills for the modern workplace and to spend on infrastructure, according to Lew, who has served as Treasury secretary under the US president, Barack Obama, since 2013 after a stint as White House chief of staff. Without such moves, he predicted drastic long-term consequences. \u201cWe run the real risk that middle class, working class people say, \u2018I see the economy is growing but I don\u2019t see how I am going to benefit from it.\u2019 The danger, if that is where things drift to, is not just a short-term political one, I actually think it\u2019s a fundamental threat to liberal democracy and to free-market capitalism.\u201d Without referring specifically to Trump and his proposal to build a wall between the US and Mexico, Lew also addressed rising concerns among voters over immigration. \u201cWe have a history [in the US] of \u2018everyone should have an opportunity\u2019, and you look at the way the modern economy has evolved and people are beginning to question that proposition. \u201cWhen people question that proposition they lash out and historically one of the places people lash out is against outsiders. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise to see that when people are anxious they lash out on issues like immigration. But the answer is not to put up borders that are impermeable \u2026 but it\u2019s also not to ignore the anxieties,\u201d Lew told his audience in Oxford. Touching on a debate at the heart of the UK\u2019s referendum battle, when pro-Brexit MP Michael Gove remarked \u201cpeople in this country have had enough of experts\u201d, Lew also raised concerns about widespread scepticism over fact-based analysis. \u201cI fear that there is a growing distrust of authorities in general \u2026 The alternative to relying on expert analysis is making decisions more emotionally and that worries me,\u201d he said. He also championed US efforts to strike free trade deals but said politicians had a responsibility to convey to people how those trade deals were improving economic growth and living standards. Barriers, on the other hand, hindered economic growth, he added, in another apparent dig at Trump\u2019s protectionist policies. Lew also congratulated himself and his administration for progress made on shoring up financial stability since the global crisis. He said conversations with big banks in the week after the Brexit vote showed him that moves to build up capital and readiness to deal with shocks was paying dividends. But he stressed that the fact the global economy had been able to withstand shocks like the referendum should not lead to complacency. \u201cWe should never take our eye off the ball in terms of asking what is the threat of the future \u2026 False complacency is a thing to worry about,\u201d he said. Earlier on Monday, Lew met bank bosses in London. Following the discussions, his spokeswoman relayed his pleas for an orderly Brexit process. \u201cThe secretary reiterated that a transparent, smooth and cooperative process that results in a highly integrated economic relationship is in the best interests of Europe, the United States, and the global economy,\u201d she said.",

    "webTitle": "Dominic Chappell 'bled BHS dry', says rival Paul Sutton", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The man who introduced Dominic Chappell to the prospect of buying BHS has accused him of bleeding the department store chain dry and said he wishes he had never met him. Paul Sutton said Chappell had done \u201cincredible\u201d damage and BHS could still have been saved after it was sold for \u00a31 by the billionaire tycoon Sir Philip Green in March 2015. BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. The retailer failed 13 months after it was bought by Chappell, a serial bankrupt. His consortium, Retail Acquisitions, is estimated to have been paid at least \u00a317m by BHS. The unwinding of BHS took another twist on Monday when a high court hearing due to consider whether to wind up Retail Acquisitions was adjourned. Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrator to BHS, is seeking the winding up order because it wants access to the Retail Acquisitions accounts and the return of millions of pounds owed to BHS. The case was adjourned after lawyers acting for Chappell submitted evidence against the order. Chappell was Sutton\u2019s driver while the latter was working with Green on a deal to buy BHS. However, this collapsed after a whistleblower delivered a dossier to Green \u2013 revealing that Sutton was convicted of fraud in France in 2002 and making a string of other allegations against him. Sutton claims that the dossier is part of a blackmail plot, which police are investigating. After Green halted talks with Sutton, Chappell stepped in and continued negotiations. \u201cI wish I had never met Dominic Chappell. The damage he has caused is incredible,\u201d Sutton told the Guardian. \u201cHe changed the team [after taking over discussions to buy BHS] then took millions of pounds and bled it dry. \u201cIf things had turned out different, I could easily have saved BHS. I told the select committee that.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco is facing a claim of more than \u00a3100m in damages by a group of investors who say the supermarket made misleading statements to the stock market. The group of 124 British institutional funds, who say they lost millions of pounds after Tesco mis-stated profits two years ago, are involved in the claim filed by law firm Stewarts Law at the high court in London on Monday. The action is being funded by Bentham Europe, a group that specialises in funding litigation and is ultimately controlled by US activist hedge fund Elliott Management. It will aim to prove Tesco made misleading statements to the stock market that omitted material information and on which investors relied when making investment decisions. Jeremy Marshall, the chief investment officer of Bentham Europe, said: \u201cThe mis-statement of profits, leading to a dramatic collapse in the Tesco share price, caused substantial damage to many shareholders who manage money for thousands of investors. \u201cInvestors have a right to rely on statements made by companies to ensure that they correctly allocate capital. The claim will assert that Tesco\u2019s mis-statements are in clear breach of its obligations under the Financial Services and Markets Act and investors must be compensated.\u201d Stewarts Law began soliciting disaffected shareholders to support joint action against Tesco in November 2014, shortly after more than \u00a32bn was wiped off the supermarket\u2019s value when it admitted in September 2014 that profits had been artificially inflated by at least \u00a3250m. The accounting scandal has led to several investigations and threatened legal action against Tesco. Law firm Scott + Scott is representing a group called Tesco Shareholder Claims, which is seeking to bring British investors together to claim billions of pounds in compensation for losses from Tesco. David Scott, the firm\u2019s managing partner, has said the group will wait to see the results of the SFO investigation before pressing ahead with the claim. Tesco is also facing potential legal action in the US, where it has agreed a $12m (\u00a39.87m) deal to settle one of two shareholder class action suits over the accounting scandal. The Serious Fraud Office has charged three former Tesco executives over the accounting scandal with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. Christopher Bush, who was Tesco\u2019s UK managing director, Carl Rogberg, the former UK finance director and John Scouler, who used to be the UK commercial director for food, have pleaded not guilty to the charges and will stand trial in September 2017. The SFO said its investigation into Tesco continues and further individuals could face action. City analysts have warned that Tesco may face a \u00a3500m fine for the accounting scandal. But there has also been speculation that the supermarket could be one of the first companies in the UK to strike a new type of deal with the SFO, which would enable it to avoid a criminal prosecution. Under powers introduced in 2014, the SFO can offer a deferred prosecution agreement, a deal requiring high court approval, which includes fines and other undertakings with a cooperating company if such a course of action is considered to be in the public interest. In January, the UK supermarket regulator, the Groceries Code Adjudicator, ruled that Tesco had deliberately delayed payments to suppliers to support its profits between June 2013 and February 2015, a move that spurred Stewarts Law to push ahead with its legal action. Sean Upson, the partner leading the Tesco case for Stewarts Law, said: \u201cTesco has mis-stated its accounts, and in particular its treatment of payments from suppliers, to give the appearance of static trading margins. The reality was that those margins were falling. \u201cInstitutional investors were therefore misled when making investment decisions in respect of Tesco. This is precisely the type of wrongdoing which the Financial Services and Markets Act was designed to redress and therefore to prevent.\u201d Tesco declined to comment on the latest action.",

    "webTitle": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso cleared of ethics breach over Goldman Sachs job", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An ethics panel has cleared the former European commission chief Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso of breaking an EU integrity code for taking a job at Goldman Sachs, but questioned his judgment in moving to the bank. An independent panel said that Barroso had not shown the considerate judgment expected of someone who had held high office for many years, but concluded there were \u201cnot sufficient grounds\u201d to determine that he had broken the commission\u2019s ethical code. The former Portuguese prime minister led the European commission for a decade until 2014. His move to Goldman Sachs to advise the bank\u2019s clients on Brexit triggered an avalanche of criticism. More than 150,000 people signed a petition drafted by EU staff criticising his decision as \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d, a French government minister rebuked him on the floor of the national assembly, and the commission launched an unprecedented ethics inquiry into the move. The investigation centred on whether Barroso had violated the EU\u2019s code of conduct that requires senior officials to \u201cbehave with integrity and discretion\u201d once they have ceased to hold high office. The petition drafted by EU staff alleged their former boss had broken the code by working for a bank that was implicated in the global financial crash and the Greek debt crisis, thus sullying the reputation of the entire European project at a time when it was rocked by the vote for Brexit. But in an eight-page report, published on Monday, the independent panel concluded there were \u201cnot sufficient grounds to establish a violation of the duty of integrity and discretion\u201d and accepted Barroso\u2019s assurances that he would not be lobbying on behalf of the bank\u2019s clients. The panel did not reach a conclusion on whether the EU\u2019s reputation had been damaged by Barroso\u2019s move. Whether fears of reputational harm were justified or not, \u201cthis damage has now been done\u201d, the committee said, adding that its remit was not to assess the wisdom or blameworthy nature of Barroso\u2019s actions. The panel said former commissioners had a right to work in the private sector, adding: \u201cGoldman Sachs may be considered at the vanguard of aggressive capitalism but as long as it respects the rule of law, it is in itself not against the law to accept a position at the bank.\u201d The three-person panel consisted of the former MEP Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, the former European court judge Christiaan Timmermans and the former commission official Heinz Zourek. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said neither the bank nor Barroso would be commenting on the report. In a recent letter to Brussels, the former commission chief accused his successors of \u201cbaseless and wholly unmerited\u201d discriminatory action against him and his new employer. The bank has said that it follows rules set by global regulators. But the case may not be completely closed. The EU ombudsman, who is responsible for upholding standards in the European institutions, said she could launch an inquiry. \u201cGiven the concern that continues to be expressed about Mr Barroso\u2019s appointment and the existing code of conduct, the ombudsman will now reflect on the next steps, including a possible inquiry,\u201d her office said. Emily O\u2019Reilly, who served as Ireland\u2019s ombudsman before taking the EU job in 2013, told the Guardian recently that the Barroso case would make the commission \u201cdeal with the revolving doors issue in a more serious way\u201d. The campaign group Transparency International described the ethics panel\u2019s conclusions as very disappointing and questioned the independence of the body. \u201cBarroso\u2019s move is just one of several revolving door cases in the last few months which point to a wider problem of integrity for the EU institutions,\u201d said Daniel Freund of Transparency International. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Brussels to up its game on ethics.\u201d The campaign group wants to reform the code of conduct for European commissioners, including extending cooling-off periods to three years. Current rules require ex-commissioners to have new jobs vetted for 18 months after leaving office. Barroso took up his bank position 20 months after leaving the commission.",

      "bodyText": "Prosecutors in Brazil have uncovered what is believed to be the biggest corruption scandal in the country\u2019s history. Many companies have been accused of paying bribes to officials at a state-owned oil giant known as Petrobras. One of them is Rolls-Royce, which is alleged to have paid a $200,000 (\u00a3165,000) bribe to win a contract to install equipment on oil rigs. Rolls-Royce has said previously that it is cooperating with the Brazilian investigation. Rolls-Royce admitted in 2013 that it had failed to declare that it had employed middlemen on civil energy contracts awarded by state-run bodies. Firms are required to declare the payment of commission to agents in civil contracts. Separately, Indian police have been examining arms deals involving Rolls-Royce between 2007 and 2011. An anonymous blogger using the name Soaring Dragon alleged that Rolls-Royce paid large bribes to two Chinese officials in 2005 and 2010 to win contracts from two of the country\u2019s airlines. One official was jailed for life, although Rolls-Royce was not named as the payer of the bribe in the court case. A former employee has claimed in interviews with newspapers that Rolls-Royce had given \u00a320m to the then Indonesian president\u2019s son Tommy Suharto to persuade the country\u2019s main airline to buy its engines in the 1990s. Suharto has denied that he received the money, or a blue car from Rolls-Royce, or that he recommended the engines to the Indonesian airline. Fana Hlongwane, a former aide to a South African defence minister, was implicated in an arms deal scandal and in 2008 was accused of channelling large payments to secure contracts for British arms firm BAE. He was not prosecuted. A leaked document seen by the Guardian and the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism in South Africa shows that in 2005, Rolls-Royce hired Hlongwane as a commercial consultant to \u201csupport and promote\u201d its business in the country. He was to be paid \u00a3140,000 for his work, according to the document. Hlongwane, who has denied being involved in corruption in the past, did not respond to a request for comment. Rolls-Royce hired agents in oil-rich Angola to try to secure lucrative contracts with Sonangol, the powerful state-owned oil company, according to leaked documents obtained by Fairfax Media. Between 2008 and 2013, the company hired a partnership between the Monaco-based agent Unaoil and another firm of agents to try to secure contracts worth more than $110m. In the aftermath of the Iraq war, Rolls-Royce hired Unaoil to help it secure contracts with the state-owned Southern Oil Company. Between 2007 and 2011, the company was particularly keen to try to secure a contract to sell three industrial turbines. In 2008, a subsidiary of Unaoil was hired to represent Rolls-Royce in Iran, though the contract would be cancelled just one year later over fears of reputational damage. Prior to this, Rolls-Royce sold industrial components to the country through a separate firm of agents. Unaoil represented Rolls-Royce in Kazakhstan from 2008, attempting to secure a contract to contribute to the China-Kazakhstan pipeline. According to Unaoil\u2019s lawyers, the partnership was still active as of July 2014, despite corruption allegations having been made against Unaoil the previous year. Rolls-Royce was using Unaoil\u2019s help to secure contracts in Azerbaijan as early as 2001. The relationship between the two companies was sufficiently close that in 2006, as work dried up, plans were made for Unaoil\u2019s Baku operation to be subsumed into Rolls-Royce\u2019s international division rather than being shut down. The Serious Fraud Office is examining whether Rolls-Royce and its agents were involved in bribing government officials to win energy contracts as recently as 2013, according to a report in the Financial Times. Rolls-Royce reportedly no longer employs the agents, who told the paper that they were not aware of the SFO\u2019s investigation. The paper said the agents did not respond to emailed questions. Britain\u2019s huge al-Yamamah arms deal with the Saudis was mired in corruption claims for years. A court case in the late 1990s revealed that Rolls-Royce, which made engines for warplanes, had paid \u00a323m to Saudi royals as part of the deal. The Guardian has previously reported details of the court case, including the claim that the money was paid into an anonymous company in Panama. The payments became public when the Saudi royals sued, claiming that Rolls-Royce had promised them nearly double that sum. The matter was settled out of court. It is unclear if these payments are being examined by the SFO in its current inquiry. Unaoil has said it was not \u201cinvolved in corrupt practices relating to its business relationship with Rolls-Royce\u201d. It said that some of the information that formed the basis of the allegations against it \u201chas been gathered as a result of criminal activity including extortion\u201d. If you would like to pass on any confidential information, you can send a message via the Guardian\u2019s SecureDrop service (see how here and here). Panorama: Rolls-Royce will be broadcast on BBC1 at 8.30pm on Monday 31 October.",

      "bodyText": "For Rolls-Royce, the stakes are high. One of Britain\u2019s most celebrated companies is facing potential prosecution over allegations it spent years hiring middlemen who paid bribes all around the world. For the company, prosecution could mean tremendous reputational damage. For any individuals implicated, it could mean jail. It is a humiliating prospect for a \u00a313bn company widely regarded as one of the jewels of British business. Rolls-Royce is considered so essential to the UK\u2019s economic wellbeing that the government retains a so-called \u201cgolden share\u201d that allows it to veto decisions it perceives to threaten the national interest. Ministers have met with the company\u2019s representatives more than 200 times since May 2010, according to an analysis by the Campaign Against Arms Trade. It also bears a proud history. Founded more than a century ago with ambitions to create the finest motorcars in the world, Rolls-Royce later supplied the engines for the single-seater Supermarine Spitfire, which repelled the Luftwaffe during the darkest days of the Battle of Britain. Following the second world war, the company began supplying equipment to aerospace, energy and marine industries all over the world. The Rolls-Royce car has been manufactured by a different company for years. So how could a company with such a stellar history find itself in such a precarious position? The modern Rolls-Royce seeks to land big contracts in highly competitive industrial arenas. Billions of pounds in profit are at stake, with many companies seeking the same contracts. Corruption is part and parcel of doing business in many of the countries in which Rolls-Royce operates, and with so much riding on each and every contract firms can come under enormous pressure to secure an advantage. At the heart of the allegations against Rolls-Royce is the suggestion that the company may have secured multimillion-dollar contracts in foreign jurisdictions by using agents who paid bribes. Rolls-Royce acknowledges it hired agents \u2013 otherwise known as commercial advisers, intermediaries or middlemen \u2013 to help sell its products. It is not illegal to hire them. These agents often market themselves to multinationals as an essential part of doing business, purporting to have exclusive access to key decision-makers or unique insights into how a bid for a contract should be structured. However, middlemen can also provide a convenient channel by which illicit cash can change hands at arm\u2019s-length. Rolls-Royce has declined to comment in detail on the corruption allegations since they first emerged four years ago. In its annual report in 2014, the multinational revealed that it had \u201cdramatically\u201d cut the number of intermediaries through which it did business around the world, a tacit acceptance that such practices were either unnecessary or inappropriate. As the Serious Fraud Office inquiry into Rolls-Royce is about to enter its fifth year, dozens of investigators continue to examine the evidence against the company. A fresh leak of documents from a firm of agents, Unaoil, to investigative journalists at Australia\u2019s Fairfax Media only adds to the complexity. Unaoil represented Rolls-Royce in at least five countries, according to those documents. As such, any decision about whether or not to prosecute Rolls-Royce and its staff or executives is unlikely to be made before 2017, according to sources familiar with the investigation. Sue Hawley, policy director at the monitoring group Corruption Watch, said: \u201cThis decision will be a key test of the UK\u2019s ability, and willingness, to bring large and politically sensitive companies to book. If Rolls-Royce are found to have engaged in wrongdoing, they must also be barred from public procurement contracts for an appropriate length of time.\u201d The British government decisively failed the last such test. An SFO investigation into alleged bribery in Saudi Arabia by Britain\u2019s biggest arms manufacturer BAE was halted by Tony Blair\u2019s government in 2006. Though said to be motivated by fear that the Saudis would withhold counter-terrorism intelligence should the investigation proceed, few anti-corruption specialists saw the decision as the UK\u2019s finest moment. So the Rolls-Royce inquiry is important for the SFO too. Theresa May was widely reported to view the agency as an unsuccessful anachronism while home secretary, and taken with the idea that its fraud and bribery functions might be folded into her new National Crime Agency. However, anti-corruption campaigners oppose such a move, and the agency may have earned a reprieve after this year securing the convictions of bankers who manipulated the Libor rates. The agency also appears to have become more proactive, establishing a new intelligence unit that follows up reports from journalists or NGOs rather than waiting for tip-offs to present themselves. Even if the SFO were to conclude it possessed sufficient evidence to prosecute Rolls-Royce, it could opt for a course of action that would inflict less collateral damage to the many entirely innocent employees and suppliers that depend on Rolls-Royce for their livelihoods. A deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) would, instead of a full criminal prosecution of the company, entail the presentation of an agreed statement of facts to a court, laying out the details of the company\u2019s conduct, as well as a large fine. Such an approach may be considered suitable for Rolls-Royce given the company\u2019s parlous financial health: it sold its energy business to Siemens in May 2014, and issued its fifth profit warning (paywall) in 20 months in September this year. However, DPAs are controversial. After HSBC was awarded one, along with a record $1.9bn fine, in 2012 after it admitted laundering money for Mexican drug cartels, the New York Times damned the settlement as \u201ca dark day for the rule of law\u201d and an effective admission that the company was too big to prosecute. As a less harsh outcome to a prosecution, such settlements are obviously attractive to companies that find themselves in the SFO\u2019s crosshairs. But to be seen to treat a defendant with kid gloves could prompt the SFO\u2019s critics to accuse it of being soft on crime, and would raise questions around fairness were any of the company\u2019s agents to be subject to full prosecution.

      "bodyText": "When Sir John Rose stepped down as chief executive of Rolls-Royce in March 2011, the company had been transformed. The so-called \u201cLion of Rolls-Royce\u201d had been in charge for 15 years and overseen the expansion of one of Britain\u2019s best-known blue-chip companies into an engineering giant on the world stage. The firm that had made engines for Spitfires during the second world war had become a \u00a313bn leviathan. Yet, cracks in its carefully crafted corporate image were about to emerge. Exactly how it started is still unclear, but by December 2012, Rolls-Royce had put itself on red alert. It acknowledged, somewhat opaquely, that it had a problem \u2013 and the Serious Fraud Office said it was investigating. At first, the SFO focused on the company\u2019s activities in the emerging markets of India and China, but the list of jurisdictions was to grow. Before long, the SFO declared it had opened a criminal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption at Rolls-Royce. In an unusual move, the company, which had conducted its own internal review of its business, made clear the seriousness of the situation. \u201cIt is too early to predict the outcomes, but these could include the prosecution of individuals and of the company. We will cooperate fully,\u201d Rolls-Royce said. In an effort to get ahead of the problem, but in a way that underlined its predicament, the company appointed Lord Gold, a former head of litigation at City law firm Herbert Smith, to review Rolls-Royce\u2019s \u201ccompliance procedures\u201d. Four years since the first reports of potential problems, and three years since the SFO began its inquiry in earnest, the scale of the investigation has become apparent. The Guardian has established the SFO team is now 30-strong, and is being supported by so-called \u201cblockbuster funding\u201d \u2013 money from the Treasury to cover exceptional costs. \u201cIt soon became clear that it was multiple jurisdictions, across several strands of its business,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the inquiry. So what has happened in the past three years? The SFO has given little away and has only confirmed making two arrests. They happened in February 2014, when it emerged that two businessmen Sudhir Choudhrie and his son Bhanu were questioned as part of its wide-ranging investigation into the activities of Rolls-Royce. Neither has been charged and a few months after the arrests, the two men had their bail conditions lifted, but the Guardian understands the SFO\u2019s inquiries are continuing. The early focus on the Choudhries has been intriguing \u2013 their lawyers said they had not and have never been middlemen for Rolls-Royce, nor paid bribes to government officials or acted as middlemen in defence deals. In short, they say they have done nothing wrong. So who are they? The Choudhries are among the wealthiest and best-known families in India. They have a wide range of business interests and have become familiar faces in political circles in the UK too. They are entrepreneurs and philanthropists, and have also been major donors to the Liberal Democrats. They and their extended families own a number of mansions in the heart of London\u2019s Belgravia. With such a high profile, they have not avoided scrutiny \u2013 or criticism. In India, for instance, Sudhir Choudhrie was investigated in 2004 by India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) \u2013 the country\u2019s foremost law enforcement agency \u2013 over suspicions related to alleged payoffs to a company agent. Years later the investigation was dropped, with Choudhrie insisting he had been a victim of a plot to damage his reputation. His lawyers told the Guardian: \u201cSudhir Choudhrie was investigated but was never arrested. He was subsequently cleared of all allegations of wrongdoing and the investigation as a whole was closed in 2011.\u201d In a closure report filed in a Delhi court that year, the CBI stated it did not find any evidence to suggest there was any payoff to Choudhrie or his companies. A list compiled and disseminated by the CBI names Sudhir Choudhrie as one of 23 \u201cunscrupulous persons\u201d on a list of \u201cundesirable contact men\u201d. The list, which has been seen by the Guardian, is undated but is understood to still be in circulation in the Indian government. Choudhrie has challenged its authenticity. His lawyers say that although he has been made aware of it, he has no knowledge of its content and has never been contacted about it by any official body. Separately from their alleged interaction with Rolls-Royce, there have been other occasions when the family\u2019s finances have raised concerns. One Swiss banking source has described to the Guardian and BBC how money transfers between the Choudhrie family group\u2019s companies sparked an anti-money laundering alert at Clariden Leu, which was then a private banking division of Credit Suisse. The Guardian has seen a report created by the risk management team at Clariden Leu in October 2008, which highlights the flow of vast sums that triggered the inquiry. The report analysed 18 \u201caccount relationships\u201d and looked at money transfers between companies owned or managed by members of Bhanu Choudhrie\u2019s extended family. One was Belinea Services Limited, which received \u20ac37,200,000 (\u00a333,400,000) from Rosoboronexport State Corporation, the Russian state\u2019s arms dealership. Bhanu Choudhrie was a director of Belinea. In the year leading up to the report, another company, the Seychelles-registered Cottage Consultants, received \u20ac28,100,000 from Rosoboronexport and transferred \u20ac22,700,000 to an Isle of Man bank. On company documents, Bhanu Choudhrie is described as the \u201cfirst and sole director\u201d of Cottage Consultants. The company is owned through bearer shares, which means it is owned by whoever physically holds the share certificates. Bhanu Choudhrie has denied being a beneficial owner of the company. Cottage Consultants had also received \u20ac9,700,000 from an entity called \u201cABC\u201d, with the money originating from Vnesheconombank, a now-sanctioned Moscow bank. The Guardian asked Bhanu Choudhrie about the transfers that had alerted Clariden Leu. His lawyers said he had no knowledge of the internal report and any suggestion that these payments were improper or illegal was false and defamatory. The twists and turns of the Choudhries\u2019 business empire have rarely been out of the news in recent years, but it is their apparent knowledge of the bureaucracy and red tape in their home country \u2013 and how best to navigate it \u2013 that might make them seem ideal middlemen for any company hoping to break into the lucrative Indian market. One such firm is alleged to have been Rolls-Royce. The firm was involved in the the massive \u2013 and massively complicated \u2013 Hawk deal, which involved India buying Rolls-Royce engines and BAE-produced planes. A first tranche of this was agreed in 2004, a second in 2010. The total value of all the contracts involved came to \u00a32.1bn. The parts were assembled at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, an Indian state-owned aerospace and defence firm, where Sudhir Choudhrie\u2019s uncle had been the chairman. The Guardian has spoken to one Rolls-Royce source. The source said the Choudhries and their companies had worked with the firm during this period. \u201cYou had to work your way and it took time,\u201d said the Rolls-Royce source. \u201cWe needed to have Indian partners or a sister company in India.\u201d The source said local fixers would help arrange the deal, before senior Rolls-Royce figures arrived to complete it. The Guardian and the BBC understand that millions of pounds of Rolls-Royce money went to the Choudhrie family. Even if this were true, it does not mean there has been any wrongdoing. Using middlemen is not illegal, so long as they abide by the rules. The Guardian asked the Choudhries to explain what role, if any, they \u2013 or their companies \u2013 had played in the Hawk deals. Lawyers for the Choudhries said they had not been middlemen or intermediaries and that any allegation that Rolls-Royce had paid them for the purpose of securing deals in India was untrue. The Guardian has been told about a curious meeting between Bhanu Choudhrie and a British businessman. It came from a banking source who spoke to the Guardian. The source alleged that Bhanu Choudhrie and a former BAE executive called Peter Ginger visited Geneva together in 2007. Ginger was BAE\u2019s president in India until 2005. The Guardian has been told that during this trip, Ginger allegedly deposited hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash into a Clariden Leu account from another account he held. By 2009, the account, which was called No 120467 Portsmouth, held about 1m Swiss francs. The Guardian has seen a copy of a bank document that shows the details of the Portsmouth account. Separately, documents discovered among the Panama Papers \u2013 the investigation into the Mossack Fonseca law firm carried out by the Guardian, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung \u2013 also reveal the family of Peter Ginger asking for a payment from an educational foundation with an apparent link to Bhanu Choudhrie. An email seen by the Guardian shows the Panamanian foundation paid to cover the university costs of one of Ginger\u2019s relatives. In one email, a member of the family requested money from the foundation to pay an allowance. \u201c[\u2026] is now back in [university ] for the summer term so we would be most grateful for payment to the same account as before,\u201d he wrote. He added: \u201cI hope this is in order and meets with [the] foundation council\u2019s approval. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me or [\u2026] if you have any questions.\u201d The payment was for \u00a3540 for four weeks of \u201cfood and subsistence\u201d. We asked Ginger and Choudrie to explain these apparent interactions. Is there a benign explanation? Could the banking source in Geneva have got it wrong? Lawyers for Bhanu Choudhrie insist he has. \u201cOur client has no knowledge of what bank accounts have been set up or operated by Mr Ginger or what sums (if any) he has deposited in them in cash. Mr Choudhrie did not pay any bribe to Mr Ginger.\u201d They added: \u201cOur client has no knowledge of any payments made [by the Foundation].\u201d The Guardian asked Ginger why he visited Geneva with Bhanu Choudhrie, and why the Panamanian foundation was funding his relative\u2019s education. He declined to comment on the allegations: \u201cI am not prepared to talk about it at all. I\u2019m not going to respond to the media at all.\u201d BAE Systems said it had \u201cno record indicating that Mr Ginger had a personal financial relationship with Mr Choudhrie during the period that Mr Ginger was employed by the Company\u201d. The episode may be nothing more than an intriguing vignette, but the SFO may have an opportunity to judge for itself. The source, who asked not to be named, has offered to speak to the SFO\u2019s investigators. The Choudhries had to wait seven years to be cleared after Indian authorities launched an inquiry \u2013 the SFO has been looking at them, and at Rolls-Royce, for a mere three. And the investigation appears to be broadening even now. Panorama: Rolls-Royce will be broadcast on BBC1 at 8.30pm on Monday 31 October.

Is there a benign explanation? Could the banking source in Geneva have got it wrong? Lawyers for Bhanu Choudhrie insist he has. \u201cOur client has no knowledge of what bank accounts have been set up or operated by Mr Ginger or what sums (if any) he has deposited in them in cash.

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce plc, Britain\u2019s leading manufacturing multinational, hired a network of agents to help it land lucrative contracts in at least 12 different countries around the world, sometimes allegedly using bribes. An investigation by the Guardian and the BBC has uncovered leaked documents and testimony from insiders that suggest that Rolls-Royce may have benefited from the use of illicit payments to boost profits for years. The network of agents is now the focus of large-scale investigations by anti-corruption agencies in the UK and the US. The Guardian understands the inquiries are looking into specific allegations that these hired intermediaries were bribing people. Rolls-Royce, which sells turbines and engines for passenger jets and military aircraft and is worth an estimated \u00a313bn, declined to answer detailed questions. A spokesman said: \u201cConcerns about bribery and corruption involving intermediaries remain subject to investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and other authorities. We are fully cooperating with the authorities and we cannot comment on ongoing investigations.\u201d The Guardian/BBC investigation, to be broadcast on the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme on Monday, discloses that the use of agents by the blue-chip manufacturer is far wider than previously publicly known. The agents have been hired in at least 12 countries \u2013 Brazil, India, China, Indonesia, South Africa, Angola, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. One individual who it is alleged has worked for Rolls-Royce is a businessman whose family has donated more than \u00a31.6m to the Liberal Democrats and is currently an adviser to the party\u2019s leader, Tim Farron. Sudhir Choudhrie and his son, Bhanu, have been arrested and questioned by the SFO over the bribery allegations. Both denied wrongdoing and were released without charge. The Guardian and the BBC understand that Choudhrie family companies were paid millions by Rolls-Royce. Labour and Conservative administrations have forged close relations with Rolls-Royce and have often lobbied foreign governments to give large export contracts to the manufacturer. David Cameron once praised it as \u201ca world leader in the development of advanced technologies \u2026 of which the whole country can be proud\u201d. The Duke of Cambridge called it \u201cone of the United Kingdom\u2019s great global companies\u201d. The investigation into Rolls is likely to concern ministers \u2013 a situation that has echoes of the controversy that enveloped the SFO\u2019s inquiry into the arms manufacturer BAE Systems. In 2006, Tony Blair\u2019s government pulled the plug on that inquiry, saying Britain\u2019s security would be put in danger if it was allowed to continue. The SFO\u2019s entirely separate investigation into Rolls-Royce became public in 2012 when the firm announced that the agency had requested information about allegations of malpractice in Indonesia and China. The following year, the SFO, backed by special funding from the Treasury, disclosed that its director, David Green, had opened a criminal investigation into allegations of bribery and corruption. It emerged in 2014 that the Department of Justice in the US had opened its own inquiry. A legal source said 30 investigators in the UK were now focused on the multinational\u2019s use of agents, or middlemen, to clinch export contracts in a number of countries across several strands of its business. Part of the SFO investigation is likely to centre on Rolls-Royce\u2019s relationship with Unaoil, a Monaco-based firm that has been accused of using bribes to win contracts in a series of countries for dozens of multinationals. This year, the SFO opened a criminal investigation into Unaoil over allegations of bribery, corruption and money laundering. Leaked documents, obtained by Fairfax Media in Australia, suggest Rolls-Royce hired Unaoil to seal contracts in Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Angola and Azerbaijan. Unaoil said it was not \u201cinvolved in corrupt practices relating to its business relationship with Rolls-Royce\u201d. It said that some of the information that formed the basis of the allegations against it \u201chas been gathered as a result of criminal activity including extortion\u201d. Another agent hired by Rolls-Royce is Fana Hlongwane, who is close to South Africa\u2019s ANC government and in 2008 was implicated in a separate corruption scandal. A confidential contract shows that in 2005, Rolls-Royce signed up Hlongwane as a commercial consultant to promote its business in South Africa. Hlongwane has previously denied that he or his companies have been involved in any corruption or wrongdoing. He has not been prosecuted for any offences and did not respond to a request for comment. Anti-corruption experts say that firms can use well-connected agents to channel bribes to key politicians or officials who are responsible for awarding contracts, although there are many different legitimate uses for agents in foreign countries. Rolls-Royce has said that since the bribery allegations began to surface, it has dramatically culled the number of agents it uses, although it has not specified how many. Admitting in its annual report two years ago that the allegations were a \u201cbody blow\u201d, Rolls-Royce has said its employees now have more direct responsibility for selling its products. In a statement, Rolls-Royce plc said: \u201cWe have made it clear that Rolls-Royce will not tolerate business misconduct or inappropriate behaviour of any kind and in recent years we have intensified our focus on ethics and compliance, which are foundations of our culture.\u201d \u201cOur global code of conduct, which applies to all of our employees, makes it clear that we have zero tolerance to bribery and corruption. \u201cIn 2014, our anti-bribery and corruption compliance team, working with internationally respected independent authority on ethics and compliance Lord Gold, completed a thorough review and update of the group\u2019s anti-bribery and corruption policies including those concerning the use of advisers and intermediaries.\u201d The SFO said it \u201cis conducting major investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption involving both Rolls-Royce and Unaoil. We cannot comment further at this time.\u201d If you would like to pass on any confidential information, you can send a message via the Guardian\u2019s SecureDrop service (see how here and here).

The RMT union and Southern\u2019s operating company, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), both issued statements on Monday proclaiming their readiness for talks, but the parties are yet to agree to a meeting. The long-running dispute over planned changes to the role of conductors, which the union fears will threaten jobs, has led to 15 days of strikes since April, adding to major disruption caused by staff shortages and engineering works. RMT members will strike all day on Friday and Saturday, and five more days of strikes are planned in November and December. GTR said it would rescind a \u201cfull and comprehensive offer\u201d made to the union should this week\u2019s strike go ahead. The company has made some guarantees on jobs, as well a \u00a32,000 bonus payment and above-inflation pay rises for two years. It has also offered to run more trains with a second, safety-trained crew member on board. In a letter to the RMT\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, GTR\u2019s human resources director, Andy Bindon, asked the union to reconsider its position, stating: \u201cYour unnecessary action is continuing to have a material and negative impact on people\u2019s work and family lives as well the regional economy and I urge you to stop.\u201d GTR said it was ready to meet this week if the union wanted to discuss its offer. However, the company still wishes, in exceptional circumastances, to have the option of running trains with just a driver\u2013 a demand the union views as the thin end of the wedge. Cash said the letter was \u201ccompletely meaningless, as the union has already rejected the \u00a32,000 bribe to sell out safety and the company are well aware of that\u201d. He added: \u201cThe action later this week goes ahead due to intransigence of the GTR bosses and their cheerleaders in government who are pulling the strings in this dispute. \u201cThe union remains available for serious talks and we would repeat the call to transport secretary Chris Grayling to get out of his bunker, get hold of the Southern management and get round the table.\u201d The union will be holding a protest and rally at parliament on Tuesday in support of its conductors, with groups representing pensioners and disabled people joining opposition politicians and unions. Southern\u2019s full timetable was due to be restored on Monday after months of reduced services and daily, unpredictable cancellations. It has not yet announced what trains it will be able to operate during this week\u2019s strike, although around three in five trains ran during the last walkouts. However, a longer, more crippling strike looms in December if the standoff is not resolved, with drivers likely to join the action. The drivers\u2019 union Aslef is balloting members this month over issues at the heart of the Southern dispute, such as the plans for driver-operated trains, and additional responsibilities for opening and closing the doors at stations. A strike called by Aslef on Southern earlier this year was halted by an injunction due to balloting irregularities.",

      "bodyText": "National Grid has been forced to replenish its buffer zone against winter blackouts as unexpected power plant outages and the clocks going back put extra pressure on the network. The grid used its capacity market notice for the first time, warning power companies to keep a closer eye on the energy market because the gap between supply and demand was narrowing. It was also permitted by energy regulator Ofgem to activate another measure, the supplemental balancing reserve, 24 hours earlier than planned. The SBR involves the grid paying dormant power plants to become operational again during winter, in case they are required to boost the UK\u2019s power supply. Its activation is understood to have been prompted by unexpected outages when plants began firing up for winter. Industry analysts said the actions did not signal the likelihood of winter blackouts, but warned that they were a symptom of an energy crunch likely to push up household bills. The Eggborough coal plant in North Yorkshire was among generators charging just under \u00a32,500 per megawatt hour for electricity at short notice, compared with average prices of about \u00a350/MWh a day in advance. Capacity market notices are issued automatically, four hours ahead of when the grid\u2019s excess capacity is forecast to fall below 500MW. This threshold is over and above the standard capacity margin safety net the grid maintains in order to ward off power cuts. But the notice indicates concern that the gap between supply and demand is falling below the level the grid would like. The week when the UK moves back to GMT is traditionally one of the tightest for electricity supply, because the darker evenings mean people use more power. The changing of the clocks also coincides with a period in which plants that have been offline during the low-demand summer months are yet to fire up again in readiness for winter. The grid warned of a squeeze beginning at 4.30pm on Monday, when it said demand, including the capacity margin, was likely to be 44,263GW, while supply would be 44,487GW. The capacity market notice is intended to warn generators so they can step in to sell electricity to the grid at short notice, while companies that use energy can agree to reduce demand in return for payments. It was the first time the operator of Britain\u2019s electricity transmission network had deployed the warning system, the government\u2019s controversial policy to ensure that the UK has enough power. National Grid eased fears about winter blackouts earlier this year, saying it expected to operate with a higher than expected margin of 6.6% this winter, ahead of the \u201ctight but manageable\u201d 5.1% margin last year. Industry sources said there were likely to be more capacity margin notices during winter as part of a new system designed to put multiple safety nets in place to minimise the risk of power outages. The energy expert Peter Atherton, a consultant at advisory body Cornwall Energy, said while the grid\u2019s decision to issue a notice should not raise fears about blackouts, it could lead to higher energy bills. \u201cThe demand and supply tightness is real,\u201d he said. \u201cNational Grid is very confident that it\u2019s manageable, but you are seeing it come through in prices.\u201d Atherton said the price that power suppliers paid for energy on the wholesale markets was already being affected by the weakness of sterling and globally higher prices for oil and gas. He said a narrow supply gap would exacerbate wholesale energy price increases, which companies were likely to pass on to consumers. \u201cWhen the system gets genuinely tight, the first canary in the coalmine is pricing, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of spiky prices,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of that will eventually come through on to bills.\u201d If margins become even tighter, the grid has an arsenal of tools it can deploy to preserve the headroom above the UK\u2019s electricity needs. The next step would be an electricity margin notice, when power plants are asked to fire up to put more power into the UK\u2019s electricity network. More drastic measures beyond that include asking companies to reduce their power usage, switching off interconnectors exporting power to Ireland and continental Europe, and switching on small local power plants, usually fuelled by gas or diesel.",

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney's time as Bank of England governor \u2013 key moments", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Carney appointed King\u2019s successor November 2012: The chancellor, George Osborne, springs a surprise on the City by announcing that Canada\u2019s central bank chief will succeed Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England. Mark Carney is the first non-Briton to become Bank governor. He is largely unknown outside the cloistered circles of central bankers and financial regulators, but has gained a reputation as a tough operator able to confront the banks at the heart of the financial crisis. December 2012: It emerges that Carney will receive a \u00a3250,000 annual housing allowance, taking his total pay package to \u00a3874,000 a year when he takes the reins in summer 2013. July 2013: Carney takes over from King. On his first day, he arrives at Threadneedle Street by tube. Carney launches \u2018forward guidance\u2019 August 2013: Carney unveils a strategy of \u201cforward guidance\u201d, under which policymakers will not consider raising rates until unemployment declines to 7% (from 7.8%). The Bank\u2019s forecast puts unemployment above 7% in 2016. The scheme is greeted with scepticism in the City. November 2013: Carney reins in the mortgage market in an attempt to prevent five years of ultra-low interest rates and Osborne\u2019s help-to-buy scheme from fuelling a housing bubble. Carney announces plastic banknotes December 2013: Carney announces that Britain will switch to using plastic banknotes from 2016, ending 320 years of paper money. The Bank says it will introduce \u201cpolymer\u201d notes, as it prefers to call them, starting with a \u00a35 note featuring Winston Churchill in 2016 and a Jane Austen \u00a310 note a year later. The move follows Carney\u2019s native Canada, where plastic notes are being rolled out. Carney insists forward guidance \u2018is working\u2019 February 2014: Six months after forward guidance was launched, the unemployment rate has dropped below 7% \u2013 two years earlier than the Bank had been expecting. However, Carney signals that the Bank will keep interest rates at a record low of 0.5% for at least another year and says policymakers \u201cwill not take risks with this recovery\u201d. He also insists that \u201cforward guidance is working\u201d. May 2014: Carney warns that the housing market poses the biggest risk to Britain\u2019s economic recovery as a shortage of new homes drives up prices. \u2018Unreliable boyfriend\u2019 warns of rate rise ahead June 2014: The Bank is given powers to control the size of mortgages. Carney says interest rates are likely to rise before the end of 2014. Later this month, members of the Treasury select committee accuse the Bank of behaving like an \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d, giving mixed messages on when the first rise in interest rates is likely. September 2014: Carney warns workers that they face higher interest rates in spring 2015, before real wages rise. May 2015: The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government is replaced by a Conservative government. The former was the first administration in more than half a century to enjoy unchanged borrowing costs for its entire term. In the first announcement from the Bank under the new government, interest rates are held at 0.5%. New interest rate rise hints July 2015: The Bank governor says an interest rate rise in the UK is \u201cmoving closer\u201d. Later this month, Carney suggests the first interest rate rise since the global financial crash could come around the turn of the year. November 2015: The Bank is ready to step up housing market controls if a prolonged period of record-low interest rates risks inflating a property bubble, Carney says. As he signals that interest rates are likely to remain on hold well into 2016, Carney suggests that the Bank may have to revert to other measures, such as tighter lending rules, to keep a lid on house prices. February 2016: Carney says policymakers in the UK could cut interest rates to zero if necessary, but would seek to avoid following Sweden, Denmark and the eurozone by setting negative rates to bolster growth and inflation. Responding to questions from MPs on the Treasury select committee, Carney says the world economy has entered a period of low growth and low interest rates and is likely to be prone to financial shocks. Seven years of record-low rates March 2016: The UK marks seven years of record-low interest rates. Research marking the anniversary claims that rock-bottom borrowing costs and quantitative easing (QE) have cost savers an estimated \u00a3160bn, but supported strong increases in the prices of property, stocks and bonds. In its analysis, financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown suggests that loose monetary policy has \u201cannihilated\u201d returns on cash. March 2016: Carney tells MPs that the referendum on EU membership is the main homegrown threat to stability. Later this month, the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee warns that a leave vote risks causing a run on sterling, a credit crunch and higher interest rates for mortgage payers and businesses. April 2016: The Bank repeats a warning that a Brexit vote could harm economic growth and have a serious impact on the pound and other UK assets. This chimes with earlier comments from the International Monetary Fund that a British vote to leave the EU risked damaging the whole region, spilling over into an already fragile global economy. Carney says the impact of current uncertainty is already being felt in the fall in the number of commercial property transactions, while jittery markets had sent the pound down by 10% since the beginning of the year. \u2018Dangerous intervention\u2019 on Brexit May 2016: The Bank warns for the first time that Britain could enter recession in the aftermath of a vote to leave the EU. At a news conference to present the Bank\u2019s economic forecasts, Carney says there are a range of possible scenarios for the economy in the event of Brexit and these \u201ccould possibly include a technical recession\u201d \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP. Carney\u2019s comments draw anger from pro-leave campaigners, with the Conservative energy minister Andrea Leadsom calling them an \u201cincredibly dangerous intervention\u201d. Carney hits back by saying the Bank has a responsibility to the British people, \u201cwho don\u2019t want risks kept from them\u201d. 16 June 2016: A week before the referendum, the Bank issues a fresh warning that a vote to leave the EU risks harming economic growth, pushing the pound sharply lower and sending shockwaves through the global economy. Announcing a decision to keep interest rates at 0.5%, the Bank says the vote is the biggest immediate risk to UK financial markets. The warning comes after Nigel Lawson, Norman Lamont, Michael Howard and Iain Duncan Smith write a Telegraph article accusing the Treasury and the Bank of a \u201cwoeful failure\u201d to offer a fair analysis of what might happen in the event of Brexit. But the prime minister, David Cameron, defends the Bank, saying the leave campaign\u2019s criticism is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. Carney steps in to calm markets 24 June 2016: As Britain wakes up to news of a leave vote, Carney seeks to calm financial markets by insisting that Threadneedle Street will take any measures needed to secure economic and financial stability. In a statement choreographed to follow Cameron\u2019s announcement that he intends to step down as prime minister, Carney says contingency plans drawn up by the Bank and the Treasury will swing into action. The governor draws praise in financial markets for his calm manner and timely comments, but worries grow over Osborne\u2019s silence. 30 June 2016: Carney lays the ground for interest rate cuts following the Brexit vote, saying the UK economy is showing signs of strain. The governor uses a speech to reassure business leaders and investors that the Bank\u2019s contingency plans are \u201cworking well\u201d and it is considering further measures to safeguard financial stability. 5 July 2016: The Bank warns of \u201cchallenging\u201d risks to financial stability and takes steps to release up to \u00a3150bn of lending to households and businesses by relaxing regulatory requirements on the banking sector. 12 July 2016: At a Treasury select committee hearing, Carney faces questions about whether he had \u201cpeddled phoney forecasts\u201d about the risks of a Brexit vote. Carney agrees to hand MPs notes of private meetings he had with the chancellor in the run-up to the EU referendum. 14 July 2016: At a scheduled policy meeting, the Bank holds interest rates at 0.5%, confounding City analysts, who had expected a collapse in business and consumer confidence to convince policymakers to support the economy and cut the cost of credit. However, the Bank puts households on notice that a rate cut is certain if the economic situation fails to improve over the next month. Rate cut to shore up economy 4 August 2016: The Bank cuts interest rates for the first time in more than seven years and expands its electronic money printing programme in a bigger than expected package of measures designed to prevent a post-Brexit vote recession. The move brings relief to borrowers, but angers savers, who have been getting low returns for years due to rock-bottom interest rates. 9 August 2016: The Bank\u2019s post-Brexit economic recovery plan gets off to a stumbling start when it is unable to buy as many government bonds as it needs from major City investors. Threadneedle Street must get reluctant investors to part with government bonds, also known as gilts, in order to provide additional stimulus to the economy under its \u00a360bn QE programme. Carney defends pre-EU referendum warnings 7 September 2016: Carney rejects claims that the Bank overcooked warnings of a hit to the economy after the Brexit vote, despite growing signs that the downturn will be shallow. Under fire from leave campaigners, the governor says he is \u201cabsolutely serene\u201d about the Bank\u2019s warning of a possible downturn in economic growth and its preparations for the impact from the Brexit vote. But the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg accuses Carney and the monetary policy committee of going too far in their warnings. 15 September 2016: The Bank leaves the door open to another interest rate cut this year, but decides that the safest option is to wait and see if the economy can continue to weather the initial shock of the Brexit vote. 16 September 2016: Carney reveals that his childhood nickname was \u201cCarnage\u201d. He tells an audience of schoolchildren in Coventry that he likes Dairy Milk chocolate, dogs and the Specials \u2013 but not Craig David. Carney responds to May\u2019s QE criticism 6 October 2016: Theresa May prompts questions about a rift between Carney and Downing Street after she criticises the impact of quantitative easing in her Conservative party conference speech, saying \u201cpeople with assets had got richer, people without them had suffered\u201d. Carney backs the prime minister\u2019s call to rethink Britain\u2019s economic policy and rejects the idea that criticism of the side-effects of unconventional measures amounted to an attack on the independence of the Bank. Carney says: \u201cI entirely agree with the spirit of what the prime minister said. I have long said that monetary policy has been overburdened. There needs to be a better balance of monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural policy.\u201d 14 October 2016: Carney says the Bank will not take instructions on policies from politicians, a week after Theresa May took a swipe at the impact of the its actions on \u201cordinary\u201d people. Speaking at Birmingham town hall as part of the Bank\u2019s Future Forum, Carney says it becomes difficult for Threadneedle Street when politicians comment on its policies rather than its objectives. 21 October 2016: Michael Gove becomes the latest senior Conservative to criticise the governor, accusing Carney of being intolerant of criticism and lacking in humility. Gove compares Carney to the Chinese emperor Ming, whose \u201cperson was held to be inviolable and without imperfections\u201d and whose critics were flayed alive. Writing in the Times (paywall), Gove says: \u201c[Carney\u2019s] position is held to be independent and without any error. And so any criticism of his actions is regarded as a thought crime.\u201d Will he stay or will he go? 25 October 2016: Carney indicates that an onslaught of criticism of his performance by the Conservative establishment will not influence whether he stays in his post beyond 2018. Asked by a House of Lords committee whether high-level interference will force him to leave, the Bank\u2019s governor says he will not be swayed by political issues as he weighs up the option of departing in two years or extending his contract by a further three years to 2021. He stays ... for an extra year 31 October 2016: Financial markets grow impatient for an indication from Carney as to when he will leave his post, following a barrage of criticism from Eurosceptic MPs about his approach to Brexit. An announcement is expected by Thursday, when the Bank next presents its economic forecasts. But sources say Carney is equally likely to delay the announcement until later in November and will take the decision based on his personal circumstances. Theresa May gives her full backing to Carney and praises his efforts to steer the UK economy through the post-Brexit vote period during a Downing Street meeting. Finally, in a 6pm announcement, Carney ends weeks of speculation about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank until Brexit negotiations with the EU have ended in June 2019 - adding an extra year to his original five year term.",

Speaking at Birmingham town hall as part of the Bank\u2019s Future Forum, Carney says it becomes difficult for Threadneedle Street when politicians comment on its policies rather than its objectives.</p> <p><strong>21 October 2016:</strong> Michael Gove becomes the latest senior Conservative to criticise the governor, accusing Carney of being intolerant of criticism and lacking in humility.</p> <p>Gove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/mark-carney-michael-gove-criticism-thought-crime-bank-england\">compares Carney to the Chinese emperor Ming</a>, whose \u201cperson was held to be inviolable and without imperfections\u201d and whose critics were flayed alive. <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/6f669c40-96fb-11e6-914a-7a36010296b9\">Writing in the Times</a> (paywall), Gove says: \u201c[Carney\u2019s] position is held to be independent and without any error. And so any criticism of his actions is regarded as a thought crime.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Will he stay or will he go?</strong></h2> <p><strong>25 October 2016:</strong> Carney indicates that an onslaught of criticism of his performance by the Conservative establishment will not influence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/should-he-stay-or-should-he-go-mark-carney-faces-big-decisition-as-he-weathers-attacks\">whether he stays in his post</a> beyond 2018. Asked by a House of Lords committee whether high-level interference will force him to leave, the Bank\u2019s governor says he will not be swayed by political issues as he weighs up the option of departing in two years or extending his contract by a further three years to 2021. </p> <h2>He stays ... for an extra year</h2> <p><strong>31 October 2016:</strong> Financial markets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/mark-carney-may-announce-decision-to-quit-thursday-bank-of-england\">grow impatient for an indication</a> from Carney as to when he will leave his post, following a barrage of criticism from Eurosceptic MPs about his approach to Brexit. An announcement is expected by Thursday, when the Bank next presents its economic forecasts. But sources say Carney is equally likely to delay the announcement until later in November and will take the decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/mark-carney-political-issues-stay-job-bank-england-lords-tory\">based on his personal circumstances</a>. </p> <p> </p> <p>Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/theresa-may-support-mark-carney-full-term-bank-of-england-governor\">gives her full backing to Carney</a> and praises his efforts to steer the UK economy through the post-Brexit vote period during a Downing Street meeting.</p> <p>Finally, in a 6pm announcement, Carney ends weeks of speculation about his future <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-extra-year-bank-of-england-governor\">by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank until Brexit negotiations with the EU have ended in June 2019</a> - adding an extra year to his original five year term. </p>",

The prime minister said she would support the Canadian if he decided to put back his departure date from Threadneedle Street until 2021 and praised his efforts to steer the UK economy through the post-Brexit vote period. May\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cThe PM has been clear in her support for the governor, the work he is doing for the country.

Asked if May considered Carney to be the best man for the job, the spokeswoman said: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Carney has said he will make a decision before the end of the year, but concluded that he needs to put the matter to rest before then. His next public appearance will be at a press conference on Thursday to mark the publication of the Bank\u2019s first quarterly inflation report since it cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% in August. May fuelled speculation of a rift between Downing Street and the Bank when she used her speech at the Conservative party conference to criticise the side-effects of ultra-low interest rates and money creation under the quantitative easing programme. No 10 quickly apologised to Carney for the remarks, insisting that they had not been intended as a sign of a lack of confidence. But the speech was followed by strong attacks from senior Conservatives, including William Hague and Michael Gove, on the Bank\u2019s conduct of monetary policy. Carney became the Bank\u2019s governor in July 2013 and said at the time that he would only serve for five years. For some time, he has been weighing up whether to stick to his original decision or remain at Threadneedle Street until 2021. Philip Hammond has already said he would welcome Carney serving a full eight-year term. The chancellor believes that the departure of the governor would create needless instability at a time when the pound has been under downward pressure on foreign exchanges.",

      "bodyText": "Governments must take the lead on reducing gender inequality to unlock almost \u00a310tn of additional global economic output, a report argues. Closing the gender gap on employment, pay and business leadership is an important source of growth in an environment of persistently sluggish figures, UBS Wealth Management says. If countries increase national female participation rates to match the best in their region it could add $12tn (\u00a39.9tn), or 11%, to the world economy by 2025, a recent McKinsey study found. But a report by the World Economic Forum found the gender gap had widened in the past four years and predicted it could take 170 years for women to reach parity. To remove obstacles, governments need to make hard choices and think long-term by providing adequate maternity and paternity leave and high quality subsidised childcare as well as promoting employment policies that encourage women to succeed, UBS said in its report, Women as a force for economic change. Only half the world\u2019s women are gainfully employed, compared with 75% for men, and women earn on average 24% less than men globally, the report said, citing OECD figures. UBS said to address the imbalance, governments needed to change the ways companies behave, getting them to remove the so-called glass ceiling that prevents women from reaching the top of organisations. The biggest barrier to equality was the lack of choice for women who have children, who are forced to leave their job or work part time, the report said. Women also take fewer advanced degrees than men so that they make up just 30% of science researchers and a third of IT workers. Tan Min Lan, who co-wrote the report at UBS, said: \u201cDespite the evidence linking gender diversity to significant gains in economic growth and company profitability, women are still largely under-represented in the workforce worldwide and continue to face daunting obstacles in corporate environments.\u201d UBS said it was in companies\u2019 self interest to treat women equally and promote their advancement because businesses with women in their senior ranks are more profitable. In the UK there has been some progress but senior business roles remain heavily dominated by men. Emma Walmsley will be the most powerful woman in the FTSE 100 when she takes over as chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline at the end of March. But she will be one of only seven women running FTSE 100 companies on current numbers. Sir Philip Hampton, GSK\u2019s chairman, is leading a government-commissioned review into increasing the number of female senior executives at Britain\u2019s top companies. Part of the plan is to promote more women into management positions who can go on to lead Britain\u2019s biggest companies. Tan said: \u201cGetting more women into work is only a partial victory if they are confined to lower levels of the corporate hierarchy. Companies have to realise that there are tangible benefits to increasing gender diversity in senior positions.\u201d Hampton\u2019s review follows progress made since the 2011 Davies report that asked FTSE 100 companies to ensure a quarter of their directors were women. That goal was achieved last year but the increase was mainly among non-executive directors and increases have since stalled. Parliament\u2019s women and equalities committee criticised the government in March for lack of action on closing the gender pay gap. The committee said the 19.2% gap had barely improved in four years despite a pledge to eradicate it within a generation.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell has warned that slowing revenue growth at his advertising company WPP appears to be early signs of business nerves over Brexit. WPP, the world\u2019s biggest ad company, said UK revenue at established businesses rose 2.1% in the third quarter \u2013 a slowdown across most of its divisions from 3.5% growth in the previous three months. Sorrell, WPP\u2019s chief executive, told the BBC: \u201cIn the third quarter we softened a bit in the UK \u2026 What it tells you is that uncertainty in the UK over Brexit and some of the other things that are going on round the world makes our clients a little bit nervous and hesitant to invest. \u201cThat level of uncertainty makes our clients less willing to invest in capital investment, building plants and making investments and, in our own parochial case, investing in innovation for consumers and brand. Uncertainty is the enemy of growth.\u201d Sorrell campaigned to stay in the EU and warned that Britain was in danger of sleepwalking into a black hole that would damage economic growth. After slowing down before the referendum, WPP\u2019s UK business picked up straight after the vote to leave but Sorrell said the economy faces tough times as Brexit takes hold. He said there would be further spats between retailers and suppliers over price rises such as last month\u2019s face-off involving Tesco and Unilever, and that consumers would feel the pinch as the weak pound raises the price of imports. \u201cIf I look at our numbers, the uncertainty doesn\u2019t help. If I look at the longer term, I look at the currency being the equivalent of the country\u2019s stock price and it doesn\u2019t help either.\u201d WPP benefited from the pound\u2019s post-referendum plunge because it earns more than 80% of its revenue outside the UK. Reported revenue surged 23.4% to \u00a33.6bn in the third quarter \u2013 excluding currency fluctuations, it rose 7.6%. The UK economy has continued to grow quicker than expected in the three months since the Brexit vote on 23 June but economists have warned about tougher times ahead when the government triggers withdrawal from the EU before April 2017.

      "body": "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell has warned that slowing revenue growth at his advertising company WPP appears to be early signs of business nerves over Brexit.</p> <p>WPP, the world\u2019s biggest ad company, said UK revenue at established businesses rose 2.1% in the third quarter \u2013 a slowdown across most of its divisions from 3.5% growth in the previous three months. </p> <p>Sorrell, WPP\u2019s chief executive, told the BBC: \u201cIn the third quarter we softened a bit in the UK \u2026 What it tells you is that uncertainty in the UK over Brexit and some of the other things that are going on round the world makes our clients a little bit nervous and hesitant to invest.</p> <p>\u201cThat level of uncertainty makes our clients less willing to invest in capital investment, building plants and making investments and, in our own parochial case, investing in innovation for consumers and brand. Uncertainty is the enemy of growth.\u201d</p> <p>Sorrell campaigned to stay in the EU and warned that Britain was in danger of sleepwalking into a black hole that would damage economic growth. After slowing down before the referendum, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/24/wpp-profits-uk-growth-brexit-sir-martin-sorrell-advertisers\">WPP\u2019s UK business picked up straight after the vote to leave but Sorrell</a> said the economy faces tough times as Brexit takes hold. </p> <p>He said there would be further spats between retailers and suppliers over price rises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/tesco-unilever-resolve-marmite-dispute-price-supermarket\">such as last month\u2019s face-off involving Tesco and Unilever</a>, and that consumers would feel the pinch as the weak pound raises the price of imports.</p> <p>\u201cIf I look at our numbers, the uncertainty doesn\u2019t help. If I look at the longer term, I look at the currency being the equivalent of the country\u2019s stock price and it doesn\u2019t help either.\u201d</p> <p>WPP benefited from the pound\u2019s post-referendum plunge because it earns more than 80% of its revenue outside the UK. Reported revenue surged 23.4% to \u00a33.6bn in the third quarter \u2013 excluding currency fluctuations, it rose 7.6%.</p> <p>The UK economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/uk-economy-shrugs-off-brexit-uncertainty-with-05-growth\">has continued to grow quicker than expected in the three months since the Brexit vote on 23 June</a> but economists have warned about tougher times ahead when the government triggers withdrawal from the EU before April 2017. Consumers, who have kept spending since the vote, are growing gloomier as price rises threaten to squeeze incomes.</p> <p>\u201cWe are really in the foothills of Brexit.

The brand favoured by Beyonc\u00e9, the actor Selena Gomez and the model Kylie Jenner increased total sales by 9% to \u00a3252.5m in its last financial year, driven by a 7.4% rise in the UK, almost none of which was down to new store openings. The UK performance comes despite widespread difficulties experienced by many British fashion brands after a warm autumn and winter last year. William Kim, the chief executive of AllSaints, said sales in the UK were up after it introduced bags for the first time and expanded its range of knitwear as well as coats and jackets, particularly in leather. Kim said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on the weather at our regular meetings. Our obsession is on the customers and the brand experience.\u201d He said AllSaints had developed its own technology to ensure it had the right product in stores at the right time and could make all items in its stores available to shoppers online as well. Online sales both via its website and third party sites rose 33% to \u00a347.3m, accounting for almost a fifth of its total sales. Overseas, AllSaints achieved strong growth in the US and Canada. It is in discussions to open more department store concessions in north America as well as in east Asia, where it recently moved into Japan. \u201cA number of American brands have struggled in Europe and vice versa but we have a strong foothold across the Atlantic,\u201d Kim said. He said AllSaints had begun selling its clothing via department store websites including Selfridges, John Lewis and in the US Bloomingdales in the past year and was now in talks with a number other third party sites to help with overseas expansion. Kim said a move into China was on the horizon and the company was also looking at other Asian markets beyond South Korea, Taiwan and Japan where it already operates. \u201cLast year we moved from 11 countries to 18 and by 2020 we should be trading in 30 to 35,\u201d he said. Kim would not give details on planned store openings but he said last year the company opened 23, and so far this year had opened about 50. He said: \u201cWe have a healthy pipeline of concessions, stand-alone stores, pop-ups, outlets, wholesale opportunities which we evaluate and prioritise accordingly.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s fund managers have written to the top 350 public companies telling them to publish how much their chief executives make compared with the average employee and to justify the amounts paid out each year. The Investment Association, which represents \u00a35.7tn in funds, said it had toughened up its guidelines for companies because of growing unease about the sums earned by chief executives. Theresa May has promised to rein in runaway pay for bosses that she says has left ordinary workers behind. In its letter to remuneration committee chairmen, the association warned that the current political and economic climate meant pay would receive a lot of attention at next year\u2019s annual general meetings. The association called on companies to publish the ratio of chief executive pay to that of the median employee and also between the chief executive and the executive team to help shareholders judge whether the payments were fair. It also told companies to explain properly why the amount paid to the chief executive was justified each year instead of referring to pay schemes set down beforehand. The more demanding guidelines follow a heated series of AGMs that featured defeats and bruising protests over pay at some of Britain\u2019s biggest companies. BP shareholders voted against the \u00a314m award for Bob Dudley, the oil company\u2019s chief executive, for a year in which it reported record losses, cut thousands of jobs and froze employees\u2019 pay. There were also heavy votes against pay at WPP, where Sir Martin Sorrell received more than \u00a370m, and at other companies such as Weir and Smith &amp; Nephew. At next year\u2019s AGMs, shareholders will cast binding votes on pay reports that every three years set out how bosses will be paid. The leaders of Britain\u2019s public companies earned an average \u00a35.5m each last year \u2013 a 10% increase \u2013 and typically earn 129 times more than their employees, according to the High Pay Centre thinktank. No FTSE 100 company yet publishes the chief executive-to-employee pay ratio. Andrew Ninian, the association\u2019s director of corporate governance, said: \u201cIssues surrounding executive pay are a growing concern for investors, politicians and society as a whole. The Investment Association and its members felt that it was vital to rebuild trust and update our principles to ensure that we are not only acting as responsible stewards for our clients but also show that we are aligned with the current climate.\u201d The association made changes to its guidelines to reflect the recommendations of a working group that reported in July. Like the group of City grandees, the association stopped short of calling for binding annual votes on pay, as proposed by Theresa May in her attack on corporate excess when campaigning for the Tory leadership. Ninian said changes to the association\u2019s principles were separate from proposals for binding votes, which are the subject of political discussion. He said investors would wait to see the government\u2019s proposals before taking a position on binding pay votes. He said overly complex pay plans had helped fuel big rises because investors had trouble understanding them. The association told companies to simplify pay structures and to publish the terms alongside the resulting pay figures so shareholders could see how they worked. The association also asked companies to consider alternatives to long-term incentive plans that have paid out huge sums to some chief executives. WPP has said it is drawing up a new pay plan for Sorrell after the previous one gave him one of the biggest paydays in UK corporate history. In another example of big payouts under existing schemes, Berkeley Homes paid founder and chairman Tony Pidgley \u00a321.5m last year thanks to share options granted in 2009. Ninian said: \u201cThe increasing complexity of remuneration structures has been the driving force behind these issues. It is vital that companies have the opportunity to choose the right structure for their business and this must be done in close partnership with their shareholders.\u201d Shareholders are under pressure to take a tough line with companies over pay. The Institute of Directors, an employers\u2019 lobby group, has said soaring pay at the top threatens to undermine capitalism and could bring unwanted government interference if companies do not put their own houses in order. Ninian said: \u201cWe look forward to working with the government as it puts together its own corporate governance agenda.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2016. There was a vote against boardroom pay at Smith &amp; Nephew, not Smiths Group, as previously reported.",

      "bodyText": "There are not enough jobs in Australia for the number of people with limited skills and experience who are looking for work, according to a new report. It shows there is only one job advertised for every six low-skilled jobseekers in Australia, and the problem is worsening. The Anglicare report, Positions Vacant? When the Jobs Aren\u2019t There, has warned the growing complexity of the economy has contributed to a downward trend for lower-skilled roles over the last decade, and an increase in demand for high-level roles. It raised concerns about the number of low-skilled people being pushed below the poverty line because the labour market can no longer accommodate them. According to the report, 13% of all jobs advertised in May were for entry-level positions, which require year 10 or equivalent education, marking a steep decline from 21% in 2006. By comparison, more than 37% of jobs advertised in May were for high-level positions, which require a bachelor degree or higher qualification. Over the past 12 months, positions at the highest skill level were the most frequently advertised, averaging 60,000 a month, compared with just 25,000 positions for the lowest skill level. Tony Nicholson, the executive director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, said it was becoming harder for unemployed and low-skilled people to find a job in Australia. \u201cOur modern economy is placing a greater focus on knowledge and service-based industries, it\u2019s placing a real premium on skills and qualifications and experience,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cAs a consequence, we\u2019re seeing a dramatic decline in the level of low-skilled, entry-level jobs \u2013 the type of jobs that, in past decades, unemployed people could have easily walked into and used as a base to build a career path.\u201d Nicholson said even in areas of strong employment growth, such as social care and health, employers now demand that employees have qualifications and skills. He said the government needed to understand that unemployed people need help to develop the skills and capabilities to match the types of jobs being created by the modern economy. \u201cThis reality is starting to dawn on many policymakers,\u201d he said. The Anglicare report condemns the \u201ccontinuing public campaign in politics and the media\u201d that suggests people without work are entirely responsible for their own circumstances, and that they could and should try harder and more successfully to get a job. It says policymakers need to understand that the economy has become increasingly complex. \u201cDisadvantaged job seekers confront additional barriers to employment,\u201d the report says. \u201cThey also face a strong presumption that there would be work available to them if they tried harder, and \u2013 for those on income support \u2013 have to live with a number of activity tests and financial penalties informed by that presumption. \u201cIn other words, rather than looking at the most effective mechanisms for improving participation by the unemployed, especially disadvantaged jobseekers, successive governments have adopted approaches aimed at shaping behaviour and punishing people when they do not respond as required.\u201d The report comes days after Christian Porter, the social services minister, warned the welfare system was flawed because \u201cthousands of parents claiming government benefits are financially better off not getting a job\u201d. He made the case for welfare cuts by claiming a single parent with four children could receive $52,523 from various government payments, an amount more than the $39,841 take-home pay of the median worker. But his claim has been hotly disputed.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney could announce a decision about his future as governor of the Bank of England as soon as Thursday, amid a barrage of criticism from Eurosceptic MPs about his approach to Brexit. It is understood that the governor is considering making an announcement on Thursday at a press conference for the Bank\u2019s third-quarter inflation report, given the speculation about his future. However, sources said Carney was equally likely to delay the announcement until later in November and would take the decision based on his personal circumstances. George Osborne, the former chancellor, played a key role in recruiting Carney for the move from Canada to the UK in 2013. According to an article in the Financial Times (\u00a3) on Sunday, the governor has \u201ctold friends\u201d that he is ready to serve his full eight-year term. The governor said last week he would make a decision by the end of this year about whether to stay on for his full eight-year term or take advantage of terms allowing him to leave after five years, in 2018. \u201cTo be clear, it\u2019s an entirely personal decision and no one should read anything into that decision in terms of government policy. It is a privilege for me to have this role,\u201d he told a parliamentary committee last week. \u201cLike everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This role demands total attention and I intend to give it as long as I can.\u201d Theresa May prompted questions about whether there has been a rift between Carney and the Downing Street after she criticised the impact of quantitative easing in her Conservative party conference speech, saying \u201cpeople with assets had got richer, people without them had suffered\u201d. Both sides have played down any suggestion of divisions since then, and the pair have recently talked on the phone. Greg Clark, the business secretary, told BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Carney had done a \u201ctremendous job\u201d for the UK economy. However, there has also been a campaign against the governor by leading Tory Eurosceptics who were annoyed by his pre-referendum predictions about the possible impact of Brexit on the UK economy, which they claim have not come to pass. Those calling for him to go early include Lord Lawson, the former chancellor; Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the public administration committee; Jacob Rees-Mogg, a member of the Treasury committee; and Daniel Hannan, a leading MEP. Before the vote, Carney suggested campaigners in favour of leaving the EU were \u201cin denial\u201d about some of the economic risks, although he has sounded more positive about the UK\u2019s prospects since the referendum. The former foreign secretary, William Hague, warned earlier this month that central bankers could lose their independence if they ignored public anger over low interest rates, while Michael Gove, the leading pro-leave campaigner and former cabinet minister, compared Carney to the Chinese emperor Ming, whose \u201cperson was held to be inviolable and without imperfections\u201d and whose critics were flayed alive. Two former members of the Bank of England monetary policy committee have rallied to Carney\u2019s defence. Andrew Sentance, who served from 2006 to 2011, told the Guardian that the story had been \u201chyped up following Theresa May\u2019s comments and articles by William Hague and Michael Gove\u201d. \u201cIf the question is whether Mark Carney is going to stay beyond 2018, when he was appointed he wasn\u2019t going to stay beyond 2018. If he makes a clear decision then it gives the government plenty of time to appoint a successor. \u201cI think he has been targeted a bit unfairly by the pro-leave Brexit campaign. The consequences of Brexit are going to play out over a number of years and to say the economy hasn\u2019t collapsed after Brexit means Mark Carney got it badly wrong is unfair. \u201cHe made it clear that he thought leaving the EU would be negative for the UK and the timescale over which that plays out depends on how that unfolds, but to jump to the conclusion within a few months when nothing has greatly changed \u2013 we are still in the EU \u2013 I think some of the criticisms of him from Brexiteers, as you might call them, have been unfair.\u201d David Blanchflower, who was on the committee from 2006 to 2009, said on Twitter that it was \u201cludicrous for Brexiters to force Carney\u201d, as it would only hurt the UK economy.",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury is warning all cash-handling retailers and vending machine operators that they need to be prepared for the new pound coin which comes into circulation in March next year. Since 2014, when the government announced in the budget its intention to introduce a \u201chighly secure\u201d \u00a31 coin after admitting the existing ones were easy to fake, the Royal Mint has been working towards a new coin\u2019s launch next spring. Millions of vending and parking machines will have to be adapted to enable them to accept the new coins, which have already been likened to the 12-sided 3d piece that disappeared with decimalisation in 1971. From Monday, businesses and other cash-handling bodies are being targeted with a new campaign to help them prepare for the new coin\u2019s arrival. A website \u2013 thenewpoundcoin.com \u2013 has also gone live. The Treasury wants retailers and others to make sure equipment and other cash-handling processes are ready for the new coin\u2019s arrival. The process is complicated by the fact that the current \u00a31 coins, which date back to 1983, will continue to be legal tender alongside the new ones until September 2017. The new coins have been introduced because 3% of the existing ones are thought to be counterfeit. The Guardian understands that around 40% of vending and other cash-receiving machines will require the coin mechanism to be removed and sent away to be upgraded. Newer machines can be updated with a simple software upgrade. However, all will be expected to accept both coins for the six-month changeover. The Royal Mint has already provided vending equipment manufacturers with sample new coins to allow upgrades to be ready in time. David Gauke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cThe pound as we know it will not be round for much longer. The introduction of this new \u00a31 coin will be a highly significant event and we are working with the Royal Mint to ensure key industries are ready and to ensure a smooth transition. \u201cThe new \u00a31 coin will be the most secure of its kind in the world and its cutting-edge features will present a significant barrier to counterfeiters, reducing the cost to businesses and the taxpayer.\u201d Jonathan Hart, chief executive of the Automatic Vending Association, said he was confident that the nation\u2019s machines would be ready. \u201cWe will continue our work to ensure that members of the vending industry are fully informed and prepared for the changes in order that the transition be as smooth as possible,\u201d he said.",
