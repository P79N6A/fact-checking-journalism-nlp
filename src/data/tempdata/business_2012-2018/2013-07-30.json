      "bodyText": "Bank of England records detailing its involvement in the transfer and sale of gold stolen by Nazis after the invasion of Czechoslovakia were revealed online on Tuesday. The gold had been deposited during the 1930s with the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the so-called Central Banker's bank, as the Czechoslovak government faced a growing threat from Germany. The document goes on to detail how a request was made in March 1939 to transfer gold, then worth \u00a35.6m, from a Czech National Bank account at the BIS to an account operated by Germany's Reichsbank. Some \u00a34m of the gold went to banks in the Netherlands and Belgium, while the rest was sold in London. The document tells how the chancellor, Sir John Simon, had asked the governor of the bank, Montagu Norman, if it was holding any of the Czech gold in May 1939, two months after the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia. It says: \"The Governor in his reply (30th May) did not answer the question, but pointed out that the Bank held gold from time to time for the BIS and had no knowledge whether it was their own property or that of their customers. Hence, they could not say whether the gold was held for the National Bank of Czechoslovakia.\" A further transaction was made that June \u2013 despite concerns from Simon being raised. On that occasion, there were sales of gold to the value of \u00a3440,000 and a \u00a3420,000 shipment to New York. According to the documents: \"This represented gold which had been shipped to London by the Reichsbank. This time, before acting, the Bank of England referred the matter to the Chancellor, who said that he would like the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown.\" The BoE's account, of what some regard as one of the Threadneedle Street's darkest episodes, was written in 1950 and published online on Tuesday following the first stage of the digitalisation of the bank's archive. It admits that the incident involving the Czech gold \"still rankled\" at the outbreak of the second world war \"and for some time afterwards\". \"Outside the Bank and the government the Bank's position has probably never been thoroughly appreciated and their action at the time was widely misunderstood,\" it adds. \"On the BIS enquiring, however, what was causing delay and saying that inconvenience would be caused because of payments the next day, the Bank of England acted on the instructions without referring to the Law Officers, who, however subsequently upheld their action.\" Professor Neville Wylie, a historian at the University of Nottingham who has examined the period as part of research into Nazi Germany's looted gold and the role of Britain and Switzerland, said on Tuesday that the Bank of England's official history of the period was news to him and shed new light on a number of issues. Wylie said that the attitude shown by the BoE in the history was consistent with what emerged from his own research into the British position towards Germany's wartime financial activities, which he described as \"wanting\". He added: \"The bank was wedded to a view of international finance and central bank co-operation. It was too concerned about maintaining London's status as an international financial centre \u2013 and clung to the need to maintain sterling's convertibility long after it was wise to continue with this policy.\" Sources at the Bank of England on Tuesday drew attention to a section in the official history, containing comments by the chancellor to the House of Commons in June 1939, when he stated that Law Officers had advised him that the British government was precluded by protocols from preventing the BoE from obeying instructions given to it by the BIS to transfer the gold.",

That's the clear message from the monthly snapshot of the UK provided by GfK, which found that sentiment is back to the level attained in April 2010, a period in which the economy posted its fastest quarterly growth since the start of the recession in 2008. On the evidence from GfK, this is more than a one-day wonder. Consumer confidence has a tendency to bounce around, but the index has risen by 11 points in the past three months and has been on a clear upward trend since the end of 2012. The 12-month moving average started the year at -29 and now stands at -25. While this hardly suggests that consumers are jumping for joy it does indicate that the mood is less gloomy than it was this time last year. Good weather could have something to do with this, but this would only explain the five-point improvement in July, not the pick up in earlier months when it was cold and wet. The compensation payments for mis-sold protection payment insurance have also helped boost consumer incomes, but were probably more important in 2012 than 2013. So what is going on? The past few months have seen the confluence of three separate trends, all positive for consumer confidence. First, the labour market has improved. There are more jobs available, and anyone who has survived this long without being made redundant is now probably breathing a sigh of relief. Second, the Bank of England has indicated that low interest rates are here to stay. There is no chance of the cost of borrowing rising until 2015 at the earliest; this may well have released some of the spending pent up over the years of hunkering down. Finally, inflation has come down from its peaks; not by enough to provide workers with increases in real wages but by enough to take a bit of pressure off household budgets. Only when incomes start to rise faster than prices will consumers finally get their mojo back. But the data now suggest solid growth in the economy in the second half of 2013.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays is asking its shareholders to come up with almost \u00a36bn as its new management team races to comply with a demand by the Bank of England that it plug a \u00a312.8bn hole in its balance sheet. The bigger than expected cash call \u2013 the largest since 2009 \u2013 sparked a 5.5% sell-off in shares, and is the centrepiece of a four-pronged strategy by the chief executive, Antony Jenkins, to meet the stringent new tests. It will allow the bank to avoid a dramatic contraction in lending to businesses and households. Jenkins also admitted the bank was increasing its provisions for mis-selling financial products by an unexpectedly large \u00a32bn, and conceded that plans he had put in place only five months ago to revitalise the bank in the wake of the Libor\u2013rigging scandal would need revisiting. Promoted only 11 months ago following the departure of Bob Diamond and other top executives after the scandal, Jenkins insisted he had not been forced into the cash call by the Bank of England and refused to apologise to Barclays shareholders for the rights issue, which launches in September. \"It's about doing the best for our shareholders,\" said Jenkins, who indicated that more cuts could come in the investment banking arm built up under his predecessor and that job cuts could be expected across the wider industry. Refusing to say if he would waive his bonus for 2013, he insisted that his plan to transform Barclays into the \"go-to\" bank was making progress but that the cash call would force him to delay achieving a crucial measure of shareholder performance by one year to 2016. Bonuses are likely to be clawed back. Halfway through the year the cost of pay and bonuses in the investment bank already stands at \u00a32.5bn Jenkins, who at the time of his presentation in February had said that 75 business lines had been assessed on the grounds of ethics, said these would now be reviewed again in the light of the Bank of England focus on a new measure of financial health known as the leverage ratio. He said the cash call was part of a \"bold and balanced plan\" to bolster Barclays' leverage ratio from just 2.2% \u2013 lower than had been expected \u2013 to 3% by the middle of June next year. This is later than originally expected but before the end of the 2015 target that Jenkins had built his \"transform\" project around. He received support from David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life, who attacked the regulators for creating a regime that is \"both capricious and hostile to banks\" and lacking consistency on its policies towards capital. Cumming said: \"From a taxpayers and investors viewpoint, this must change. If not, funding available for business both large and small will be reduced, while funds realised from future government share sales will be materially below the levels achievable if we had a more objective and coherent regulatory policy.\" The government is thought to be considering signalling a sell-off of part of its 39% stake in Lloyds Banking Group after the bailed-out bank reports its results on Thursday. In an effort to address Barclays' culture, Jenkins is sending Barclays' 140,000 employees on courses to train them in his new values, which are also emblazoned on huge acrylic blocks in the cavernous foyer of the bank's Canary Wharf headquarters. He said his successor should inherit a bank free of the legacy issues he is trying to tackle. If it was not raising the capital, Barclays would have had to reduce its balance sheet by \u00a3427bn. The Bank of England's regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, said it had approved the latest capital plan because it did not involve \"cutting back on lending to the real economy\". The \u00a35.95bn cash call will be priced at a 40% discount to Monday's share price and investors will be offered one share at 185p for every four shares they already own. The bank will raise \u00a35.8bn after fees have been paid to the investment banks guaranteeing the cash call, who have a get-out clause if the circumstances change. Jenkins said that he hoped the rights issue would reduce the lingering uncertainty about the bank's capital position for shareholders as he enhanced the bank's dividend \u2013 currently 1p a quarter. Justin Cooper, chief executive of Capita Registrars said there could be have been a bigger fall in the share price without the pledge on dividends from 2014. \"To announce an increase in the dividend for next year at the same time is a contradiction, raising money from shareholders with one hand and paying it straight back to them with the other\". Barclays also published first-half results including another \u00a31.35bn provision for payment protection insurance \u2013 taking the total to \u00a34bn \u2013 and a further \u00a3650m for interest rate swap mis-selling, taking the total to \u00a31.5bn. Including these costs, and a cost of buying back its own debt, the statutory profits were \u00a31.7bn, up 93% from the same time last year. Plugging the \u00a312.8bn gap \u00a36bn Rights issue: a cash call on investors which will not be launched until September and will raise \u00a35.8bn after fees paid to other banks, which are guaranteeing the fundraising \u00a32bn Issue of bonds: a relatively new form of bond called contingent convertibles, dubbed co-cos, which convert to shares during times of crisis. \u00a32.5bn Shrinking the bank: by reducing the size of the bank's balance sheet by 2014 Barclays can reduce the amount of capital it needs to hold by this amount \u00a32.5bn Retaining earnings: the bank will keep a larger portion of the money that it makes between now and June 2014. The cash might otherwise have been paid out in dividends to shareholders or as bonuses to staff",

People across the country tell what it is like not to know how big next week's pay cheque is going to be \u2013 or if they will receive one at all. A few have agreed to be named, but many current employees whom the Guardian has spoken to have done so on condition of anonymity.</p> <h2><strong>Sports Direct, retailer</strong></h2> <p><strong>Zahera Gabriel Abraham, 30, former worker, Croydon</strong></p> <p>\"If you happen to fall out of line, or your manager thinks you have not done very well that week, your hours just get cut \u2013 you feel like you are just at the beck and call of the people above you. I felt I always had to play up to someone's ego just to work \u2013 and in the end you just start to feel a bit bullied. I suffered several panic attacks and had to take a couple of days off ...</p> <p>\"I felt very unhappy, very bullied and intimidated by the situation, because I didn't know week to week what I was going to get. My work life was very uncertain and as a parent I found it very, very difficult to live like that.\"</p> <p>Abraham, who has a 12-year-old daughter, worked for Sports Direct for eight months before walking out after another panic attack in November.</p> <p>\"Regularly they would call you in the middle of the day and they are like 'Can you come to work now?' You feel like you have to say yes because if you say no you are seen as unreliable and the next week you don't get a shift, it is as simple as that \u2026 I felt hugely manipulated and bullied the whole time.\"</p> <p><strong>Part-time staff member, 25</strong></p> <p>\"I had been working full-time for Sports Direct for two years and was entitled to the bonus but I had to demote myself because I'm a single mother and had just got out of an abusive relationship.</p> <p>\"I couldn't work the 45 hours a week I&#xa0;was doing because my daughter's nursery shut at 6pm and I couldn't finish work on time to get there, so I asked my manager if I could go to part-time.</p> <p>\"He told me I could only take a zero-hours contract, but he managed to give me fairly regular hours of around 20 a week. However, the area manager would call up from time to time to say we needed to cut hours because we weren't hitting targets.</p> <p>\"It was really frustrating to have given loyal service for so long to be told when circumstances changed that I could only get a zero-hours contract. And while the hours have been fairly regular, there is always the risk that they could change at the last minute at the whim of the area manager.\"</p> <p>Sports Direct declined to comment.</p> <h2><strong>Cineworld, cinema chain</strong></h2> <p><strong>Anonymous part-timer, 26, London</strong></p> <p>\"I have worked there for about four years. Our working week starts on a Friday and the rotas normally go up on a Monday or Tuesday so we find out then what hours we have. It creates real difficulties, I have to pay rent and phone bills and stuff like that. When you're working five days a week that is pretty much OK but when suddenly you are down to 20 hours or something it becomes a problem.</p> <p>\"You can offer to take other people's shifts but when the work is scarce everyone is looking. You have to get permission to swap from a manager and when they say no, that is when it is really frustrating \u2026</p> <p>\"It's stressful and it's disappointing, to be honest, because often Cineworld don't seem to understand that a lot of people are relying on this money to live. I live with my mum but I still have to pay rent and pay for food and travel and stuff, but I can never plan anything because you never know what your hours are going to be like next week\u2026</p> <p>\"When I left college this is not what I thought my job would be like.\"</p> <p><strong>Student part-timer, 24, East Anglia</strong></p> <p>\"As a student I am part-time so it is not too bad for me but once I finish my studies it is going to be a real problem. There are other people that work there that I don't know how they survive on how little hours we get some weeks.\"</p> <p>He added that he sometimes got as much as 30 hours a week, other times as few as 10 hours.</p> <p>\"It does affect even me because obviously there is a lot less you can do when you are only getting \u00a3280 some months. I can survive off that but it is still quite a low amount of money especially when you are used to a bit more ...</p> <p>\"A lot of the people are between 18 and about my age; there are a few people there who are slightly older but some of them also have full-time jobs and just work here in the evenings or weekends.\"</p> <p><em>Cineworld declined to comment.</em></p> <h2><strong>Tate Catering, services for the modern art museums</strong></h2> <p><strong>Louise Brady, 32, Liverpool</strong></p> <p>\"We were always fighting for hours. I&#xa0;felt I had to prove myself all the time, doing everything they asked, coming into work even when I felt sick. Doing that meant you got a good rating and the most amount of hours on the rota.</p> <p>\"The better people always got the hours. You could see people getting the worst shifts and lowest hours were the ones managers didn't like.\"</p> <p>Brady said only the most compliant staff would emerge with more than 25 hours a week and described how managers would call in the evening asking her to turn up the next morning. In busy periods she was asked at short notice to wait on tables at black-tie dinners and clear up in her own time.</p> <p>\"I felt my employee rights were non-existent. There was no way I could even think about starting a family in that situation.\"</p> <p>The Liverpool-based graduate was paid the minimum wage and statutory sick pay. She had to buy her outfit for evening work and wash her daytime uniform.</p> <p>\"The manager would call, usually in the evening, to say what shifts were available. If I missed him, which happened sometimes, I might only get a few hours. So you needed to have your phone charged and nearby.\"</p> <p>Tate Catering, which is owned by the Tate Gallery and provides food at Tate Modern, Tate Britain and the galleries in St Ives and Liverpool, confirmed that it has staff on permanent zero-hours contracts but refused to give details.</p> <h2><strong>Greene King, pub chain </strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Barman, 30, London</strong></p> <p>\"I've been working for Greene King behind the bar for a year on a zero-hours contract. Our bar operates on the basis that they want more staff available than they actually need, so that they can always call on people when they suddenly get busy, but the business wants absolutely no responsibility to ensure you make the money you need to live on in return.</p> <p>\"I've had random, unpaid training and menu-tasting sessions, and I'm expected to start a shift or change a shift at the drop of a hat. Our rota for the week should be available mid-week the week before, so you have some idea of when you're working and how much. In practice, it actually appears sometime that weekend, right before the week begins.</p> <p>\"You are in no way guaranteed the hours you need, leaving staff to barter and scramble to pick up extra shifts from each other.</p> <p>\"Throughout shifts, managers are constantly trying to gauge how few staff they can get away with. If you're not totally pushed and struggling to keep up, someone will get sent home.</p> <p>\"I'm lucky enough to work several jobs, so I don't have to totally rely on bar hours to pay my rent But I work with a chap with a young family to support, and he has no reliable way of ensuring he will get enough hours to pay the bills. It's heartbreaking to see him constantly fret about whether he'll be able to raise enough money for a child's birthday or school trip, while the parent company posts colossal profits.\"</p> <p>No one was available from Greene King to comment.</p> <h2><strong>London Care, private-sector provider</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Caroline, 49, homecare worker, London</strong></p> <p>\"I have been working in homecare for 25 years, looking after elderly people in their own homes. The contract used to be with the council but it got taken over first by a charitable organisation, then a private company \u2013 London Care. They introduced a zero-hours system and I felt absolutely devastated to get the letter to say that is what they were doing because you budget, don't you, so you never spend more than you have got. But that just isn't possible on these contracts, all of a sudden any sort of security is taken away from you.</p> <p>\"I had to stop getting the internet and you have to shop differently \u2013 you're always looking for the bargains, trying to save anything you can, because you do not know where the next cheque is coming from \u2026 Your whole life changes,&#xa0;really.\"</p> <p>Caroline spent more than a year on a zero-hours contract, then last summer \u2013 following a campaign by the Unison trade union \u2013 she was put on a permanent contract.</p> <p>\"When I was on a zero-hours contract my wages went down by half. It puts a lot of strain on you; it causes you stress and worry, and the thing is, even when they say the work is there, you are never sure how much you will be paid for. You can go out from 7.30am to 7.30 in the evening but only get paid for 5 hours ... it is just mind-blowing to be honest. I don't know how councils can give contracts like that to profit-making companies when we are trying to look after vulnerable people, it doesn't make any sense.\"</p> <p>London Care confirmed that it uses zero-hours contracts for its casual and part-time staff</p> <h2><strong>The career changer</strong></h2> <p><strong>Michael Holliday, 55, Bromborough, Wirral</strong></p> <p>After 29 years in the chemical industry, Holliday went back to college. Last year he completed a computer science degree at the Chester University.</p> <p>\"I was finishing my degree and started to look for jobs when I was given the name of an agency. I was told I had an interview with a local computer firm and arrived to find lots of people completing numeracy and literacy tests. I did mine. Then a few weeks later I got a call, but I had exams. When they rang again, it became clear the contract was zero-hours.</p> <p>\"There are no other jobs like it, but I'm 55 and they want 25-year-olds who don't have responsibilities. With a zero-hours contract you don't know when you are going to work, there is no security, and I've still got a mortgage to pay. Yes, my wife works as a nurse but she doesn't earn very much. I need steady employment.\"</p> <p>Holliday is unable to claim jobseeker's allowance and instead works part-time as a cleaner at a doctor's surgery while he looks for a permanent position. My school in the 1970s was churning out factory fodder and that is what we were all educated to do, but I regretted not being able to go to university so when the opportunity arose I took it.</p> <p>\"I've been to interviews in Manchester and considered Birmingham. Now I've got to think about London. My wife and I have agreed on moving because there aren't the jobs.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Guardian News &amp; Media, publisher of the Guardian, does not employ anyone on zero-hours contracts.</em></p> <p><em>The company also has a fixed team of contracted outsourced staff in the canteen, security and switchboard. In the canteen none of the fixed staff are on zero-hours contracts. </em></p> <p><em>However, the outsourced company does use six zero-hours employees to manage any sickness/holiday/overtime cover for canteen staff who work at GNM offices.</em></p> <p><em>In other outsourced areas there are two people on zero-hours contracts who are based in the Guardian's Kings Place office. They are paid at least the London living wage and receive annual pay rises and training.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 July 31. An earlier version said that Tate Catering had confirmed that all part-time staff were on zero-hours contracts but refused to comment further. This has been amended to say it confirmed that it has staff on permanent zero-hours contracts but refused to give details. It has subsequently contacted us to say that Tate Catering staff on zero-hours contracts accrue holiday pay and are entitled to company sick pay.</p>",

Sports Direct, retailer Zahera Gabriel Abraham, 30, former worker, Croydon \"If you happen to fall out of line, or your manager thinks you have not done very well that week, your hours just get cut \u2013 you feel like you are just at the beck and call of the people above you. I felt I always had to play up to someone's ego just to work \u2013 and in the end you just start to feel a bit bullied. I suffered several panic attacks and had to take a couple of days off ... \"I felt very unhappy, very bullied and intimidated by the situation, because I didn't know week to week what I was going to get. My work life was very uncertain and as a parent I found it very, very difficult to live like that.\" Abraham, who has a 12-year-old daughter, worked for Sports Direct for eight months before walking out after another panic attack in November. \"Regularly they would call you in the middle of the day and they are like 'Can you come to work now?' You feel like you have to say yes because if you say no you are seen as unreliable and the next week you don't get a shift, it is as simple as that \u2026 I felt hugely manipulated and bullied the whole time.\" Part-time staff member, 25 \"I had been working full-time for Sports Direct for two years and was entitled to the bonus but I had to demote myself because I'm a single mother and had just got out of an abusive relationship. \"I couldn't work the 45 hours a week I was doing because my daughter's nursery shut at 6pm and I couldn't finish work on time to get there, so I asked my manager if I could go to part-time. \"He told me I could only take a zero-hours contract, but he managed to give me fairly regular hours of around 20 a week. However, the area manager would call up from time to time to say we needed to cut hours because we weren't hitting targets. \"It was really frustrating to have given loyal service for so long to be told when circumstances changed that I could only get a zero-hours contract. And while the hours have been fairly regular, there is always the risk that they could change at the last minute at the whim of the area manager.\" Sports Direct declined to comment. Cineworld, cinema chain Anonymous part-timer, 26, London \"I have worked there for about four years. Our working week starts on a Friday and the rotas normally go up on a Monday or Tuesday so we find out then what hours we have. It creates real difficulties, I have to pay rent and phone bills and stuff like that. When you're working five days a week that is pretty much OK but when suddenly you are down to 20 hours or something it becomes a problem. \"You can offer to take other people's shifts but when the work is scarce everyone is looking. You have to get permission to swap from a manager and when they say no, that is when it is really frustrating \u2026 \"It's stressful and it's disappointing, to be honest, because often Cineworld don't seem to understand that a lot of people are relying on this money to live. I live with my mum but I still have to pay rent and pay for food and travel and stuff, but I can never plan anything because you never know what your hours are going to be like next week\u2026 \"When I left college this is not what I thought my job would be like.\" Student part-timer, 24, East Anglia \"As a student I am part-time so it is not too bad for me but once I finish my studies it is going to be a real problem. There are other people that work there that I don't know how they survive on how little hours we get some weeks.\" He added that he sometimes got as much as 30 hours a week, other times as few as 10 hours. \"It does affect even me because obviously there is a lot less you can do when you are only getting \u00a3280 some months. I can survive off that but it is still quite a low amount of money especially when you are used to a bit more ... \"A lot of the people are between 18 and about my age; there are a few people there who are slightly older but some of them also have full-time jobs and just work here in the evenings or weekends.\" Cineworld declined to comment. Tate Catering, services for the modern art museums Louise Brady, 32, Liverpool \"We were always fighting for hours. I felt I had to prove myself all the time, doing everything they asked, coming into work even when I felt sick. Doing that meant you got a good rating and the most amount of hours on the rota. \"The better people always got the hours. You could see people getting the worst shifts and lowest hours were the ones managers didn't like.\" Brady said only the most compliant staff would emerge with more than 25 hours a week and described how managers would call in the evening asking her to turn up the next morning. In busy periods she was asked at short notice to wait on tables at black-tie dinners and clear up in her own time. \"I felt my employee rights were non-existent. There was no way I could even think about starting a family in that situation.\" The Liverpool-based graduate was paid the minimum wage and statutory sick pay. She had to buy her outfit for evening work and wash her daytime uniform. \"The manager would call, usually in the evening, to say what shifts were available. If I missed him, which happened sometimes, I might only get a few hours. So you needed to have your phone charged and nearby.\" Tate Catering, which is owned by the Tate Gallery and provides food at Tate Modern, Tate Britain and the galleries in St Ives and Liverpool, confirmed that it has staff on permanent zero-hours contracts but refused to give details. Greene King, pub chain Barman, 30, London \"I've been working for Greene King behind the bar for a year on a zero-hours contract. Our bar operates on the basis that they want more staff available than they actually need, so that they can always call on people when they suddenly get busy, but the business wants absolutely no responsibility to ensure you make the money you need to live on in return. \"I've had random, unpaid training and menu-tasting sessions, and I'm expected to start a shift or change a shift at the drop of a hat. Our rota for the week should be available mid-week the week before, so you have some idea of when you're working and how much. In practice, it actually appears sometime that weekend, right before the week begins. \"You are in no way guaranteed the hours you need, leaving staff to barter and scramble to pick up extra shifts from each other. \"Throughout shifts, managers are constantly trying to gauge how few staff they can get away with. If you're not totally pushed and struggling to keep up, someone will get sent home. \"I'm lucky enough to work several jobs, so I don't have to totally rely on bar hours to pay my rent But I work with a chap with a young family to support, and he has no reliable way of ensuring he will get enough hours to pay the bills. It's heartbreaking to see him constantly fret about whether he'll be able to raise enough money for a child's birthday or school trip, while the parent company posts colossal profits.\" No one was available from Greene King to comment. London Care, private-sector provider Caroline, 49, homecare worker, London \"I have been working in homecare for 25 years, looking after elderly people in their own homes. The contract used to be with the council but it got taken over first by a charitable organisation, then a private company \u2013 London Care. They introduced a zero-hours system and I felt absolutely devastated to get the letter to say that is what they were doing because you budget, don't you, so you never spend more than you have got. But that just isn't possible on these contracts, all of a sudden any sort of security is taken away from you. \"I had to stop getting the internet and you have to shop differently \u2013 you're always looking for the bargains, trying to save anything you can, because you do not know where the next cheque is coming from \u2026 Your whole life changes, really.\" Caroline spent more than a year on a zero-hours contract, then last summer \u2013 following a campaign by the Unison trade union \u2013 she was put on a permanent contract. \"When I was on a zero-hours contract my wages went down by half. It puts a lot of strain on you; it causes you stress and worry, and the thing is, even when they say the work is there, you are never sure how much you will be paid for. You can go out from 7.30am to 7.30 in the evening but only get paid for 5 hours ... it is just mind-blowing to be honest. I don't know how councils can give contracts like that to profit-making companies when we are trying to look after vulnerable people, it doesn't make any sense.\" London Care confirmed that it uses zero-hours contracts for its casual and part-time staff The career changer Michael Holliday, 55, Bromborough, Wirral After 29 years in the chemical industry, Holliday went back to college. Last year he completed a computer science degree at the Chester University. \"I was finishing my degree and started to look for jobs when I was given the name of an agency. I was told I had an interview with a local computer firm and arrived to find lots of people completing numeracy and literacy tests. I did mine. Then a few weeks later I got a call, but I had exams. When they rang again, it became clear the contract was zero-hours. \"There are no other jobs like it, but I'm 55 and they want 25-year-olds who don't have responsibilities. With a zero-hours contract you don't know when you are going to work, there is no security, and I've still got a mortgage to pay. Yes, my wife works as a nurse but she doesn't earn very much. I need steady employment.\" Holliday is unable to claim jobseeker's allowance and instead works part-time as a cleaner at a doctor's surgery while he looks for a permanent position. My school in the 1970s was churning out factory fodder and that is what we were all educated to do, but I regretted not being able to go to university so when the opportunity arose I took it. \"I've been to interviews in Manchester and considered Birmingham. Now I've got to think about London. My wife and I have agreed on moving because there aren't the jobs.\" \u2022 Guardian News &amp; Media, publisher of the Guardian, does not employ anyone on zero-hours contracts. The company also has a fixed team of contracted outsourced staff in the canteen, security and switchboard. In the canteen none of the fixed staff are on zero-hours contracts. However, the outsourced company does use six zero-hours employees to manage any sickness/holiday/overtime cover for canteen staff who work at GNM offices. In other outsourced areas there are two people on zero-hours contracts who are based in the Guardian's Kings Place office. They are paid at least the London living wage and receive annual pay rises and training. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 July 31. An earlier version said that Tate Catering had confirmed that all part-time staff were on zero-hours contracts but refused to comment further. This has been amended to say it confirmed that it has staff on permanent zero-hours contracts but refused to give details. It has subsequently contacted us to say that Tate Catering staff on zero-hours contracts accrue holiday pay and are entitled to company sick pay.",

      "bodyText": "So, with the Italian supreme court closed for the night, I'll shut up shop here too. Back tomorrow with more coverage from Rome, and the usual fare. Thanks, and goodnight. GW The Supreme Court in Rome has just adjourned for the day. Silvio Berlusconi's final appeal will resume on Wednesday, when his legal team led by Franco Coppi is expected to present their counter arguments. As explained at 4.07pm, Berlusconi's case is made up of around 50 different point. This includes the argument that the former PM wasn't really in ful charge of Mediaset when the offences took place, as he was busy with his political career. A verdict could come tomorrow, or we might be left wating until Thursday.... A reminder of the importance of this case: Today's appeal hearing at the Supreme Court (which could last until Thursday) is Silvio Berlusconi's final attempt to avoid a ban from public office and a jail term over a tax fraud conviction involving his Mediaset empire. If the sentence is upheld, then political analysts fear Berlusconi's Freedom Party could pull its support for the fragile Italian coalition. That could bring down prime minister Enrico Letta. So, why has the prosecutor recommended reducing the public office ban from five years to three? Reuters explains that the move was made on \"technical legal grounds\" One piece of idle speculation did strike me: that by cutting the sentence, the prosecutors reduce the risk that judges will acquit Berlusconi or void the verdict and start the process again... That's just a personal thought. Alternatively, they could simply be responding to the Berlusconi side's case. (updated for clarity). Reuters' Rome bureau provides details of the latest development in Silvio Berlusconi's appeal -- the fact that the prosecution has proposed that the public office ban should be cut: An Italian public prosecutor on Tuesday asked the country's top court to reduce former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's ban from public office for tax fraud to 3 years from 5, but to confirm a one year prison term. The supreme court is hearing Berlusconi's last appeal in a case which could threaten the survival of Italy's shaky coalition government if his conviction is confirmed. Berlusconi was sentenced to four years in jail by the lower court but this has been reduced to one year under a 2006 amnesty. ANSA, the Italian news agency, has details of the early skirmishes in the Berlusconi court case: The four-year conviction regards a system of inflated film-rights purchases at Berlusconi's Mediaset media empire and the use of offshore companies to create slush funds. Prosecutors say this enabled Berlusconi to dodge taxes on around seven million euros in 2002 and 2003. \"There is a thread that is given from the continuity of the system starting from the period of its invention in the 1980s,\" Prosecutor Antonello Mura told the Cassation Tuesday. Mura said the aim was to \"inflate costs for tax benefits and produce payments for the creation of substantial capital abroad\". Berlusconi says he had nothing to do with these dealings or authorising them as he was too occupied with political matters. He was premier at the time. Franco Coppi, a member of Berlusconi's defence team, said that the \"crime does not exist\", adding that he was aiming to have the conviction overturned. More here. Open Europe's Vincenzo Scarpetta also flags up this latest development: (reminder: Open Europe's analysis of the case is covered at 12.23pm) A late newsflash from Rome, saying the Italian prosecutor has asked for Silvio Berlusconi's ban from public office to be reduced: \u2022 ITALY TAX FRAUD CASE PROSECUTOR REQUESTS REDUCTION OF BERLUSCONI BAN FROM PUBLIC OFFICE TO 3 YEARS FROM 5 BUT CONFIRMATION OF PRISON SENTENCE Looking for more details now.... Associated Press reports that Silvio Berlusconi's lawyer, Franco Coppi, tried to avoid guessing the outcome of today's hearing. Not completely successfully. Here's a flavour of its report from the Italian supreme court in Rome, as Berlusconi's appeal was being heard: The tensely awaited decision, which could have an impact on Italy's fragile, three-month-old coalition government, is expected Wednesday or possibly Thursday, Berlusconi's lawyer Franco Coppi told reporters outside the courtroom. Berlusconi's case is one of eight on the docket, and the last one to be heard. \"I'm superstitious and I don't make predictions,\" Coppi said during a break after the court spent two and a half hours summarizing the case, but he added: \"I expect to win.\" Charles Forelle of the Wall Street Journal calculates that large depositors with over \u20ac100,000 in Bank of Cyprus are only getting back 15% of that 'unsecured' funds straight away, under the deal announced today (see 3.49pm): This handy graphic shows how the Greek bailout funds have been spent since its first bailout in 2010. You'll note that a lot was used to cover maturing debt (the large purple slice), along with interest payments (red) and recapitalising the banks (grey/blue). Very little was actually spent by the Athens goverment (primary deficit in blue, and 'other government needs' in green). That's via Yiannis Mouzakis, a handy expert on the crisis based in Cyprus (who blogs as The Prodigal Greek). Just in - the European Commission has (as rumoured last week) approved France's \u20ac7bn loan to the financing arm of struggling auto firm PSA Peugeot Citroen. The EC did insist, though, that the loan was made at a higher price, to avoid competition concerns. Commissioner Joaquin Almunia explained: This is a balanced result which offers the PSA group the chance to make a new start on a sound basis. Readers with an interest in economic history might like to know that the Bank of England has made various historical documents available online. News Release - Historic Bank of England publications and documents now available online It includes more than 80,000 ledgers, files and individual records. FT Alphaville's Joseph Cotterill has been trawling, and dredged up a few highlights already: Nice piece in the Economist this afternoon on Silvio Berlusconi's court appeal hearing today. Between a rock and a hard place It points out that Berlusconi's defence is based on around 50 objections to the original conviction: Central to their case is the argument that the billionaire media proprietor, who was prime minister at the time of the alleged offences in 2002 and 2003, was then not really in charge of Mediaset, his television empire. That is the first of the ironies: his lawyers\u2019 task would be a lot easier if, back in the 1990s when he entered politics, Mr Berlusconi had listened to his adversaries and ring-fenced his business interests from his political career. If Berlusconi loses this final fight, \"JH\" writes, then prime minister Enrico Letta might have to ask his MPs to vote against the sentence \u2013 even though Berlusconi is a longtime opponent. If they refuse, the coalition could fall. At the least, it would enhance the prospects of Letta's rival, \"the more telegenic, albeit less experienced, Matteo Renzi, the mayor of Florence\". One of the PdL\u2019s lawmakers, Francesco Giro, told an interviewer as the court was assembling that Mr Berlusconi, though incurably optimistic, was \u201canxious\u201d. He was not the only one. It's official. Large investors with more than \u20ac100,000 in Bank of Cyprus when the country collapsed into a bailout this year are surrendering 47.5% of that money in exchange for new shares in the company. The Central Bank of Cyprus announced the news today. It put a positive spin on it, saying \"significant progress\" had been made in recapitalising BoC. According to Reuters, the move means depositors will lose around \u20ac8bn. And what of the rest? The Central Bank of Cyprus explained that 12% of deposits that were previously blocked will be released. The balance will be split into three deposits per customer, which will be locked for six, nine and 12 months each. However,... BoC will have the option to renew the time deposits once for the same time duration So in practice, savers might not get their hands on any of the money for a year, and could have to wait 24 months for the lot. Here's the full statement: Significant progress at Bank of Cyprus with the completion of the recapitalisation and the exit from resolution And as this picture shows, anger over the Cypriot bailout is still visible: Mixed news from America on the consumer confidence front -- the headline measure calculated by the Conference Board fell ths month, to 80.3 from 82.1 in June. US consumers, it seems, are growing more worried about the future. The expectations index slid to 84.7, from 91.1. That suggests growing worries about America's economic growth through the year, as fiscal cutbacks hit home. The 'present situations' index, though, climbed to its highest level since May 2008. Back in Italy, its supreme court spent this morning hearing a summing up of the legal arguments in Silvio Berlusconi's tax fraud case. They then called a lunch break \u2013 giving the crowds of reporters outside the court a glimpse of Berlusconi's legal team. Public prosecutor Antonello Mura was lined up to present his case after the break. As flagged up earlier, Berlusconi's lawyers \u2013 and some legal experts \u2013 don't expect a verdict tonight. Strong housing data from America this afternoon, where prices continue to romp ahead. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index, covering 20 US cities. showed a 2.4% rise in house prices during May. That means a positively perky 12.2% year-on-year rise - the biggest annual increase since March 2006. House prices in Dallas and Denver are now at record levels. The San Francisco showed the biggest gains, up 4.3% in May. Atlanta, Chicago, San Diego, and Seattle also posted gains of more than 3%. Analysts had expected an even bigger rise, of 12.4% year-on-year. But ithe broad picture remains upbeat And here's a couple of snaps of Greece's finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, during his upbeat interview with Reuters (see 1.27pm). Alas, no photos of the broken window... Over in Greece, finance minister Yannis Stournaras has suggested the Greek government may avoid incurring a black hole in its bailout plan. In a decidedly upbeat interview with Reuters, Stournaras argued that Greece's economy may actually perform better than its lenders predict. A decent tourism season and a well-executed reform plan could mean Greece avoids the fiscal gap, of around 2% of GDP, which the Troika has predicted. Stournaras argued that Greece's main threat is \"political risk\", not economic, due to MPs running out of enthusiam and patience for austerlty. He said: MPs just reflect the average man or woman in the street - they have to believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel. If they believe it they will continue voting the few necessary measures left over, if they don't they are not going to. This is the great risk. Reuters also reports that Stournaras's office, in the centre of Athens, still sports a broken window thanks to \"a bullet fired by angry anti-austerity demonstrators in 2010\". This 'feature' has also caught the eye of investors visiting Greece... It can be hard to keep track of Silvio Berlusconi's various legal travails. On top of the Mediaset tax fraud case under consideration today, he has also been convicted of breaching confidentiality in March 2013 over a leaked police wiretap, and also found guilty of underage sex charges in June. Helpfully, Open Europe have published a guide to today's case: Q&amp;A: All you need to know about Berlusconi's tax fraud trial and its potential implications for the Italian government It explains how the four-year prison sentence, if upheld, would need to be approved by the Senate, and that Berlusconi's age means most of the sentence would probably be annuled. But Open Europe also warns that the political implications are unclear: Several senior members of Berlusconi's party have evoked drastic retaliation (withdrawal from government, resignation en masse of Berlusconi's MPs and Senators, snap elections, and so forth). The truth is Il Cavaliere would make the final decision - and his party would then almost certainly follow the leader. Sure enough, there would be the potential to trigger a political crisis in Italy. A couple more snaps from Rome, as judges at the supreme court consider Silvio Bersluconi's appeal: Berlusconi's court case drama did not alarm bond investors this morning at an auction of Italian debt. Italy managed to raise its target of \u20ac6.75bn through selling new five and 10-year bonds without any obvious difficulty. Yields (or interest rates) dropped compared to the previous sale of this type. Nick Spiro, sovereign bond expert at Spiro Sovereign Strategy, said the results showed that markets remain unconcerned over political risk in Italy, thanks to the potential support on offer from the European Central Bank Mario Draghi, it seems, is more important than Silvio Berlusconi to Italy right now. Spiro writes: Once again, the travails of Mr Berlusconi cast a long shadow over Italian politics. The \"Berlusconi factor\" seems to be a permanent fixture on Italy's political landscape. Yet the big difference between now and 2011 is that Italian politics is of scant concern to markets. Only a sudden collapse of Mr Letta's government is likely to trigger a sharp sell-off - and even this would almost certainly not be as severe as previous bond market routs if the reaction to February's inconclusive election is anything to go by. The reality is that the ECB's bond-buying programme, in spite of all its shortcomings, continues to suppress Spanish and Italian yields. Silvio Berlusconi's lawyer, Franco Coppi, has told journalists in Rome this morning that he doesn't expect a verdict today. That's via Reuters, which adds that Coppi said the defence would not request that the case be postponed until September. The judges could still decide to do that on their own account, though. It appears that the Italian judges will not issue a verdict tonight, unless it is to postpone the whole process: Back to Italy, and here's a photo from outside the Court of Cassation building in Rome. Police officers are in action as the judges settle down to consider Silvio Berlusconi's final appeal against his conviction, ban from public office and prison sentence for tax fraud (see opening post for the details). Interestingly, shares in companies within Berlusconi's media empire are all up this morning, as trader Alessandro Aimone explains: Perhaps investors anticipate a good result for the former PM. As Alberto Nardelli explained at 7.58am, the sentence could be overturned, or voided, or delayed.... Eurozone economic sentiment is now at a 15-month high (see previous post), which reinforces the chances that the euro area will exit recession this quarter. But with the main readings stuck in negative territory, or below the long-term average, the data also shows that the recovery will be tough. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons the eurozone should eke out 'marginal growth' later this year. All business sectors saw confidence rise in July, with the exception of construction, which consumer confidence rose to a 23-month high. Similarly most countries saw confidence pick-up including Germany, France, Italy and Spain. However.... it is hard to see consumers generally lifting their spending markedly in the near term as their confidence is still limited despite improving appreciably to a 23-month high in July while they are still facing generally high unemployment and limited purchasing power (as limited wage growth and tight fiscal policy counters moderate inflation). The situation does vary markedly though between countries and German consumers are well placed to spend more. Business and consumers across the eurozone are less pessimistic about the economic climate, according to data just published by the European Commission. Economic sentiment across the eurozone rose to 92.5 in July, from 91.3 in June, the EC reported. Better, but (understandably) still below the 100-mark average. The data generally showed an improving situation, although the picture is clearly still tough: \u2022 The industrial climate reading rose to minus 10.6, from minus 11.2. \u2022 Services sentiment picked up to minus 7.8, from minus 9.6 And consumers remained nervous, with a sentiment reading of minus 17.4, from minus 18.8. Elsewhere in the City this morning: BP's $20bn fund to compensate those hurt by the Deepwater Horizon disaster is running dry, with just $300m in the tank. Full story here. Here's our full story on Barclays revealing a \u00a312.6bn capital shortfall this morning, and announcing a \u00a36bn rights issue: Barclays pushed into \u00a36bn cash call to plug capital gap Barclays is asking shareholders for almost \u00a36bn of cash as the bank's new management team races to comply with a demand by the Bank of England that it plug a \u00a312.8bn capital shortfall. As Antony Jenkins admitted on Tuesday the bank was increasing its provisions for mis-selling financial products by \u00a32bn, he conceded that Barclays had been forced to change its plans as a result of the actions of the Bank of England, which showed the bank's finances were in a worse state than previously thought. The crisis in the eurozone may have hit Sweden, with the surprise news that its economy shrank in the last three months. The Swedish statistics office dashed forecasts of a 0.1% rise in GDP by reporting a 0.1% contraction in the April-June period. That's a sharp deterioration on the 0.6% expansion in the first quarter of 2013. The contraction means the Swedish economy has only grown by 0.6% over the last 12 months, down from 1.7% year-on-year three months ago. Analysts urged caution, as these are only preliminary statistics. As Robert Bergqvist of SEB put it: The main reason for the weakening of the economy in second quarter is very weak external demand, and problems within the euro area. On other hand, private consumption is fairly strong, and retail sales yesterday were also strong and that confirms the key growth driver is households, and private consumption. And this graph from the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica shows how Spain's economy has slumped over the last eight quarters: Ebrahim Rahbari, Citi analyst, is more downbeat about Spain's prospects, commenting: We're not counting on a further improvement in the third quarter and are very sceptical of any statement that the recession in close to being over. In an environment where there is more than 25 percent unemployment, a slightly positive GDP figure does not mean the recession has ended. (via Reuters) Economist Shaun Richards agrees that the Spanish GDP data is an improvement: Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale tweets that the 0.1% drop in Spanish GDP in the last three months shows its economy is levelling out. Breaking: Spain's economy has now been shrinking for two full years. Data just released by the Spanish National Statistics Institute showed that Spanish GDP fell by 0.1% between April and June. That's the eighth quarterly contraction in a row. Encouragingly, though, the pace of decline has slowed -- following the 0.5% contraction suffered in the first three months of 2013. And on a year-on-year basis, the Spanish economy has shrunk by 1.7% -- slightly better than the 1.8% economists had expected. I don't think we can call it a green shoot of recovery \u2013 but perhaps the bitter frost is easing? There are four possible scenarios of how the Supreme Court ruling over Silvio Berlusconi could play out, explains political analyst Alberto Nardelli. \u2022 the ruling is postponed. \u2022 Berlusconi\u2019s lawyers ask for the ruling to be postponed - they have until Tuesday morning to put in a formal request. Risky, as it would freeze the statute of limitations. \u2022 Berlusconi is acquitted - two possibilities in this scenario: 1) sentence is void and the appeal trial needs to start again (which could end with the statute of limitations kicking in (Sept. 2014)) and 2) full acquittal. \u2022 the sentence is upheld - the key point here, which is missing from lots of media analysis I\u2019ve read is the fact that the ban from public office needs to be rubber stamped by a Senate committee vote Nardelli also suspects that a` final ruling might not come until Wednesday or Thursday. Here's his full analysis: Silvio Berlusconi Mediaset verdict - possible scenarios Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Judgement Day is looming for Silvio Berlusconio, in a case that could have major implications for the stability of the Italian government, and perhaps the eurozone too. Italy's supreme court will meet today to consider Silvio Berlusconi's final appeal against a 1-year jail sentence and 5-year ban from office for tax fraud. If the judges uphold the ruling, then the three-times prime minister \u2013 who has dominated the Italian system for two decades \u2013 would face ejection from politics. And that prospect raises the threat that Berlusconi's People of Liberty party would pull the plug on Enrico Letta's shaky-looking coalition. Tense times, with rumours swirling that the judges might take the pragmatic step of delaying a decision. As my colleague Lizzy Davies explains from Rome: If the judges agree with those verdicts, they are likely to enforce the requested sentence of four years in prison and a five-year ban on holding public office. The former is unlikely to cause the 76-year-old to lose much sleep as prisoners of his age rarely go to jail in Italy and, due to a 2006 amnesty law, he would be more likely to spend a year under some form of house arrest. But the latter could effectively end the political career of a man who, for better or worse, still plays a highly influential role in his country's affairs. As head of the centre-right Freedom People (PdL) party, the main partner in centre-left prime minister Enrico Letta's government, Berlusconi is still capable of bringing down the coalition by withdrawing his support, should the moment suit him. However, as the date of the cassation hearing has approached, speculation has mounted that the decision could be postponed. Tense times - especially as legal experts are split on how long it will take to get the verdict... Here's Lizzy's full story. It's looking like a busy day generally. There's plenty of economic data to shed new light on the state of the eurozone, including Spanish GDP data for the last three months (at 8am BST) and euro area consumer confidence and business confidence (at 10am BST). It's also hectic in the City -- with Barclays dominating attention with news that it is tapping shareholders for almost \u00a36bn to improve its capital base. It's also announced that another \u00a32bn is being set aside to cover compensation for consumer misselling.... Here's the statement from Barclays on its rights issue. My collleagues are on the case with that story now.... I'll be tracking all the developments through the day....",

If the judges uphold the ruling, then the three-times prime minister \u2013 who has dominated the Italian system for two decades \u2013 would face ejection from politics.</p> <p>And that prospect raises the threat that Berlusconi's People of Liberty party would pull the plug on Enrico Letta's shaky-looking coalition.</p> <p>Tense times, with rumours swirling that the judges might take the pragmatic step of delaying a decision.</p> <p>As my colleague <strong>Lizzy Davies</strong> explains from Rome:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the judges agree with those verdicts, they are likely to enforce the requested sentence of four years in prison and a five-year ban on holding public office. The former is unlikely to cause the 76-year-old to lose much sleep as prisoners of his age rarely go to jail in Italy and, due to a 2006 amnesty law, he would be more likely to spend a year under some form of house arrest. But the latter could effectively end the political career of a man who, for better or worse, still plays a highly influential role in his country's affairs.</p> <p>As head of the centre-right Freedom People (PdL) party, the main partner in centre-left prime minister Enrico Letta's government, Berlusconi is still capable of bringing down the coalition by withdrawing his support, should the moment suit him.</p> <p>However, as the date of the cassation hearing has approached, speculation has mounted that the decision could be postponed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tense times - especially as legal experts are split on how long it will take to get the verdict... <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/29/silvio-berlusconi-appeal-final-verdict\">Here's Lizzy's full story</a>.</strong></p> <p>It's looking like a busy day generally.

The bank, which is also being investigated alongside the four employees, refused to reveal the conclusions reached by the City regulator but said it was contesting them. The regulator has not yet issued a formal warning notice, which would outline more details of its case, but the completion of the preliminary investigation comes as the bank prepares to draw up a prospectus asking investors to back a \u00a36bn cash call vital to plug a \u00a312.8bn capital shortfall. Antony Jenkins, the bank's chief executive, refused to elaborate on the FCA findings at a time when the bank is under particular scrutiny by shareholders who must decide whether to back the crucial fundraising exercise. In a formal statement contained in seven pages of legal and regulatory warnings, the bank said the FCA had provided its preliminary findings on 27 June and that it had responded to these on 25 July. \"Barclays expects further developments in the near term,\" it added. The City regulator's investigation was later followed by other authorities. In August last year, the Serious Fraud Office also began an investigation into the matter while in October the US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission and the justice department launched an investigation to establish if there were any breaches of the US foreign corrupt practices act. Last July when Barclays first disclosed the investigation by City regulator \u2013 then the Financial Services Authority \u2013 Barclays said that it \"considers that it satisfied its disclosure obligations and confirms that it will co-operate fully with the FSA's investigation.\" The bank said on Tuesday that the investigation was specifically into \"certain commercial agreements between Barclays and Qatari interests and whether they have related to Barclays capital raisings in June and November 2008\". \"Barclays is co-operating with all the authorities fully.
