      "body": "<p>Argentina was engaged in a last-ditch attempt to avert its second debt default in 13 years on Wednesday night as tense negotiations with bondholders ran to the wire ahead of a midnight deadline in New York.</p> <p>Markets were optimistic that a deal could be hammered out at the eleventh hour, with the value of the country's bonds and shares rising.</p> <p>Hopes were boosted by the prospect of a potential intervention by Argentina's banking association. Under the proposals, a consortium of Argentinian banks would offer to buy the country's debt held by so-called holdout investors, who refused to join other bondholders in taking a haircut on Argentina's debt holdings in restructuring deals in 2005 and 2010.</p> <p>A US judge ruled earlier this year that the holdout investors should be paid in full, saddling Argentina with a bill of more than $1.5bn that it says it is unable afford.</p> <p>An agreement appeared some way off, however, after a senior banking executive familiar with the offer and quoted by Reuters said that discussions had yet to be held with the hedge funds involved. \"The idea is to sit down with the funds and buy all their debt. We have to negotiate the final amount, the terms and how payment will be made,\" the executive said.</p> <p>Axel Kicillof, Argentina's economy minister, was holding late-stage talks in New York with its holdout creditors and US mediators to try to reach an agreement and avoid a default.</p> <p>Neil Shearing, chief emerging economist at Capital Economics, said that negotiations were likely to be taken to the brink of the deadline. \"There is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding this and it is going down to the wire. The chances of an eleventh hour agreement are higher than they were on Tuesday but we may well end up with an Argentinian default. The key point is that contagion to other markets has been extremely limited, so it remains a localised issue.\"</p> <p>The deadline of midnight New York time marks the end of a 30-day grace period after Argentina was blocked from paying a $539m (\u00a3319m) instalment due on its restructured bonds on 30 June. The payment was due to the vast majority of Argentina's bondholders who accepted the debt restructuring deals in 2005 and 2010, wiping value off their holdings, and which the government wanted to honour.</p> <p>The move was blocked, however, by the US judge Thomas Griesa, who ruled Argentina could not pay the restructured bonds back unless it also paid more than $1.5bn to the holdout investors. Argentina has insisted it cannot afford to do both. Once the 30-day grace period expires, Argentina will technically default on the restructured bonds.</p> <p>Led by the country's president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Argentina has refused to pay investors she has branded \"vulture funds\", which are holding out for full repayment. The fear in Argentina is that any deal to repay the holdouts in full would trigger lawsuits from the bondholders who accepted haircuts in 2005 and 2010, demanding to be paid on similar terms. The government in Buenos Aires estimates that the associated liability could run to as high as $15bn.</p> <p>The holdouts are US hedge funds spearheaded by the billionaire Paul Singer's NML Capital, an affiliate of Elliott Management, and Aurelius Capital Management.</p> <p>More than 90% of Argentina's bondholders agreed to the debt restructuring deals in 2005 and 2010, under which they would get regular interest payments provided they accepted a reduction of more than 70% in the value of their investment.</p> <p>The restructuring was agreed in the wake of Argentina's previous crisis, when the country defaulted on around $100bn of debt in 2001.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Argentinian embassy in London said on Wednesday there was no update on the last minute talks in New York and that negotiations were ongoing.</p> <p>Emiliano Surballe, a fixed income analyst at the Swiss private bank Julius Baer, said Argentina faced mixed outcomes from the talks, even if it avoids a default.</p> <p>\"Choosing to default should free up cash resources to serve other immediate financial liabilities. However, it would completely shut down access to foreign funding,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Avoiding the default has two main consequences: it could generate contingent liabilities from other creditors that received large haircuts in the past, but would open the door to access international financial markets, resulting in a re-valuation of Argentinian assets.\"</p>",

The payment was due to the vast majority of Argentina's bondholders who accepted the debt restructuring deals in 2005 and 2010, wiping value off their holdings, and which the government wanted to honour. The move was blocked, however, by the US judge Thomas Griesa, who ruled Argentina could not pay the restructured bonds back unless it also paid more than $1.5bn to the holdout investors. Argentina has insisted it cannot afford to do both. Once the 30-day grace period expires, Argentina will technically default on the restructured bonds. Led by the country's president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Argentina has refused to pay investors she has branded \"vulture funds\", which are holding out for full repayment. The fear in Argentina is that any deal to repay the holdouts in full would trigger lawsuits from the bondholders who accepted haircuts in 2005 and 2010, demanding to be paid on similar terms. The government in Buenos Aires estimates that the associated liability could run to as high as $15bn. The holdouts are US hedge funds spearheaded by the billionaire Paul Singer's NML Capital, an affiliate of Elliott Management, and Aurelius Capital Management. More than 90% of Argentina's bondholders agreed to the debt restructuring deals in 2005 and 2010, under which they would get regular interest payments provided they accepted a reduction of more than 70% in the value of their investment. The restructuring was agreed in the wake of Argentina's previous crisis, when the country defaulted on around $100bn of debt in 2001. A spokesman for the Argentinian embassy in London said on Wednesday there was no update on the last minute talks in New York and that negotiations were ongoing. Emiliano Surballe, a fixed income analyst at the Swiss private bank Julius Baer, said Argentina faced mixed outcomes from the talks, even if it avoids a default. \"Choosing to default should free up cash resources to serve other immediate financial liabilities. However, it would completely shut down access to foreign funding,\" he said. \"Avoiding the default has two main consequences: it could generate contingent liabilities from other creditors that received large haircuts in the past, but would open the door to access international financial markets, resulting in a re-valuation of Argentinian assets.\"",

      "bodyText": "The cost of the payment protection insurance scandal has soared again after Barclays set aside another \u00a3900m to cover the costs of compensating customers mis-sold the insurance product. Consumer body Which? calculated the total bill faced by banks and other lenders had now hit \u00a323bn \u2013 and it could rise further on Thursday when Lloyds Banking Group, which has already made \u00a39.8bn of provisions, is scheduled to update the market. Barclays, which has now set aside \u00a34.8bn for PPI, said on Wednesday that the latest claims related to policies sold more than 10 years ago and have been brought by claims management companies. More than 40% of the claims were from customers who never had a Barclays policy. Barclays revealed the rising cost of PPI as the bank reported a 7% fall in first-half profits to \u00a33.3bn, including a near-halving of profits in its once-dominant investment bank, which is now no longer the biggest contributor to profits. The high street bank contributed \u00a31.5bn compared with the investment bank's \u00a31bn. The bank's shares \u2013 down a third this year and hit by fraud allegations brought by the New York attorney general in June \u2013 rose 4% to 228.4p and were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100. The allegations by attorney general Eric Schneiderman about the way Barclays treated customers in its \"dark pool\" private stock exchange have been a setback for chief executive Antony Jenkins's attempt to clean up the bank's reputation after it was fined for rigging Libor two years ago. Barclays denies the charges. Jenkins, who has also been under pressure about bonus policies, refused onWednesday to disclose how much of the investment bank's revenue will be used to pay its staff. He said this figure \u2013 the compensation ratio \u2013 would now be published only at the end of the year as it was \"not very useful\" to continue publishing it every three months. Dismissing suggestions that the ratio was higher than the 46% published for the first quarter of the year, Jenkins said: \"I've been very clear about compensation \u2026 Compensation should move in line with performance.\" He faced criticism earlier in the year after raising bonuses 10% when profits for 2013 had fallen 32%. He justified the payments by saying the bank would have faced a \"death spiral\" of staff quitting if the payments had not been made. Since then he has announced plans to scale back the investment banking arm, including cutting 19,000 jobs in the coming years. Barclays's total global workforce \u2013 135,000 \u2013 is already at its lowest level since 2007 after 5,000 roles went in the first half of the year. \"Structural cost reduction is vital to achieving strong returns, and we continued to make progress on reducing operating expenses while maintaining controls and improving customer and client experience. Headcount across the group is now at the lowest level since 2007,\" he said. With the industry facing a full-blown investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, Jenkins said he thought it was a \"good idea this inquiry explore fully every aspect of the market\". Profits in the investment bank fell 46% and by 12% in its African arm. Profits in Barclaycard rose by 24% and its high street banking division saw a rise of 23%, largely because of a cut in provisions for bad debts rather than a rise in income. Eight pages of legal warnings attached to the interim results showed the bank would be subjected to additional scrutiny by the US authorities for another year as the department of justice was extending the two-year non-prosecution agreement (NPA) put in place at the time of its \u00a3290m Libor-rigging fine in June 2012. That NPA would have expired last month but has been extended because of the ongoing investigations into alleged foreign exchange manipulation, which could also lead to another American regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services, installing monitors in the bank. The legal disclosures repeat that the bank is fighting a \u00a350m fine from the Financial Conduct Authority for disclosures it made at the time of cash calls during 2008 and that this process has been stalled by an ongoing investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. As part of his efforts to clean up the bank's image, Jenkins has shut the structured capital markets business, which conducted tax avoidance. Two-thirds of the 100 staff that used to work in the controversial division were still employed by the bank, he said. The Luxembourg arm, through which much of the tax planning business was channelled, reported profits of \u00a31.4bn in 2013, a sum which should halve this year, the finance director, Tushar Morzaria, said.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a brief recap: America\u2019s economy has returned to growth, with GDP surging at an annual rate of 4.0% in the second three months of 2014. The growth, equivalent to 1.0% during the April-June quarter, beat forecasts. January-March\u2019s data also revised to show a less severe contraction. Economists say the report shows the US recovery is on track, with consumer spending and business investment both rising. However, some are warning that a build-up of inventory stocks was responsible for a third of the expansion. The chair of Barack Obama\u2019s council of economic advisors has warned that America would be in even better shape if politicians on Capitol Hill would show more leadership. Jason Furman wrote: The economy could do even better if Congress does its part to help \u2014 starting with taking the steps needed to ensure that work on our roads and bridges is not brought to a halt this fall. Here\u2019s our story: US economy bounces back with 4% GDP growth in second quarter In other news: Spain\u2019s economy has posted its strongest growth since the financial crisis began, growing its GDP by 0.6% in the last quarter (the equivalent of almost 2.5% in an annualised basis). While Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate fell. In the UK, new rules to allow bankers bonuses to be clawed back after seven years have been outlined. Simon Chouffot, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says it is welcome, but not enough: \u201cAfter five scandal-ridden years it is right that the authorities are promising to clamp down on the industry\u2019s rewards for failure.\u201d The new sanctions imposed on Russia had little immediate impact on the Moscow stock market, where the ruble and many shares rallied. Economists warn that Russia faces the threat of economic stagnation, though: The day began with Barclays announcing another \u00a3900m provision for PPI mis-selling, and a big drop in profits at its investment banking arm. However it refuses to say how much cash is being set aside for those bankers. And in New York tonight, the Argentina default talks are going down to the wire.... Time spent reading Joseph Cotterill on Argentina\u2019s debt battles is never wasted: The International Monetary Fund has warned that Cyprus must make further progress to emerge from its bailout. In its latest assessment of the Cypriot deal, released this afternoon, the Fund said: Cyprus has come a long way in addressing the crisis. The financial sector has been stabilized, substantial fiscal consolidation has been implemented, and sweeping structural reforms are underway. The cost of the crisis has been large, and painful but necessary measures have imposed an unavoidable cost on the population. Looking forward, significant challenges remain, and they will not be resolved overnight. The authorities will need to stay focused on and committed to adopting the necessary policies to advance their adjustment program in order to pave the way for sustainable growth. Cyprus: 2014 Article IV Consultation Concluding statement of the IMF Mission Argentina\u2019s bid to avoid defaulting on its debt is heading to the wire. The country\u2019s economy minister, Axel Kicillof, has reportedly arrived at the New York offices of the New York-based mediator in the last hour. They have until midnight US time (5am BST tomorrow) to hammer out some kind of deal with the holdout investors who are demanding full repayment on bonds which Argentina defaulted on over a decade ago. Reuters adds: A Reuters witness said Kicillof made no comment as he entered the building. Argentina has until the end of the day to clinch a deal or it will default on its debt for the second time in 12 years. Here\u2019s a photo of Kicillof leaving last-night\u2019s talks: There has been speculation today of a last-minute deal, possibly with Argentina\u2019s banks buying the bonds from the holdout investors. The cost of insuring Argentinian debt fell sharply, but still remained very elevated, while the value of its government bonds recovered a little. The head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s European department has resigned, after some turbulent years during the eurozone crisis. Reza Moghadam is leaving the Fund to join Morgan Stanley, become their Vice-Chairman in Global Capital Markets. Moghadam has run the European Department since 2011, and \u201cplayed a crucial role in shaping the most important decisions in the Fund\u2019s work on Europe in recent years.\u201d The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has done a great take on the news: Another crisis figure moves on: IMF\u2019s Moghadam Here\u2019s a flavour: When the crisis broke, Moghadam, a Briton of Iranian heritage, was head of the IMF\u2019s strategy, policy and review department, long viewed as the part of the fund most critical of the way the eurozone handled the crisis in its early days. Moghadam rose to prominence as one of the most vocal early advocates of a write-down of Greek debt, something that only adopted nearly two years into the crisis \u2013 a delay the IMF later argued was a mistake. Moghadam also clashed with the EC during the Cyprus bailout debacle, over Brussels\u2019 reluctance to impose losses on bank depositors. Poul Thomsen, who has been leading the IMF\u2019s mission to Greece, has been named Acting Director for an interim period while a permanent replacement is found. We mentioned earlier that roughly a third of the increase in GDP was due to companies restocking their inventories. This means growth is likely to slow later this year, say Barclays analysts: Barack Obama\u2019s top economic advisor, Jason Furman, argues that the US economy could grow even faster with some bipartisan co-operation on Capitol Hill. Furman, chair of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, writes: Economic growth in the second quarter was strong, consistent with the recent further improvement in the labor market and other indicators. The economy could do even better if Congress does its part to help \u2014 starting with taking the steps needed to ensure that work on our roads and bridges is not brought to a halt this fall. But to make further progress, the President is pressing ahead on his own authority, taking action to facilitate investments in American manufacturing, energy, and infrastructure. Furman also points out that real GDP growth in 2011 and 2012 was revised down today, to an average annual rate of 1.6 percent. That takes the shine off the upgraded growth rates in 2013 and Q1 2014. Chris Williamson of Markit tweets a graph showing that the contraction in January-March was an anomaly, due to icy blizzards: The economy looks stronger now, Williamson says: \u201cHowever, this is not just a case of better weather. There is evidence to indicate that there has also been an underlying improvement in the economy, and that robust growth will be sustained into the third quarter.\u201d Although probably at a more moderate pace. Here\u2019s our news story on the US GDP report, by Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe: The US economy bounced back strongly in the spring, shaking off the effects of an unusually harsh winter, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy, grew by 4% on an annual basis, better than the average of 3% predicted by economists. In the first three months of the year the economy shrunk by 2.1%, the Commerce Department announced, softening its first estimate of a 2.9% fall. Annual revisions also released on Wednesday show the economy grew by 4% in the second half of 2013, its fastest pace of growth in a decade. Despite the good news the economic recovery remains the weakest since the second world war. GDP has grown by just 1% in the first six months of the year. The pick up in the economy in late 2013 was wiped out by one of the harshest winters on record and even at 4% the pace of recovery remains sluggish.... More here: US economy bounces back with 4% GDP growth in second quarter Here\u2019s a handy chart showing which sectors contributed to the strong US growth in the last quarter: James Knightley of ING reckons that the Federal Reserve will take the plunge and raise US interest rates in April 2015: After all, the economy is showing clear signs of strengthening and inflation is likely to become more of an issue. The strengthening labour market will mean wages eventually respond while the lagged effects of house price rises are starting to be seen in various housing rent indices \u2013 remember shelter accounts for around a third of the inflation basket. The Fed are likely to acknowledge this stronger tone to some extent in tonight\u2019s FOMC statement, but a more significant shift in language is probable at the September FOMC. Ben Brettell, Hargreaves Lansdown Senior Economist, is encouraged that the US economy has bounced back faster than expected. \u201cThe rebound was driven by lower energy prices, strength in the manufacturing sector and increased demand for exports. A healthier labour market is boosting consumer confidence, which is at a near-seven-year high. However, the IMF and the Federal Reserve disagree on prospects for the year as a whole, with the IMF forecasting a disappointing 1.7% and the Fed a more optimistic 2.1%-2.3%. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, reckons the Fed will raise US interest rates in eight months time. This GDP report supports our view that an improving economy will persuade the Fed to begin raising rates in March next year. Nancy Curtin, CIO at Close Brothers Asset Management, says that growth in the US has stepped up a level in recent months. \u201cThe US economy has a spring back in its step after the disastrous impact of arctic conditions in the first quarter. Since the weather abated, data has been broadly positive. Strong figures for the service sector combined with resurgent consumer confidence and improving manufacturing all hinted at a revival in fortunes, and the second quarter reading has delivered in spades.\u201d The US dollar has rallied on the back of the US GDP report, gaining 0.2% against both the pound and the euro. Traders are calculating that the growth report means the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates a little earlier than before. Dovish Fed members, though, are likely to remain focused on the US labour market. As Janet Yellen pointed out to senators this month, wage growth remains weak. A stronger dollar is also good news for the eurozone: Reminder: Fed policymakers are meeting today, and are expected to trim their stimulus programme by $10bn per month, from $35bn to $25bn. Neil King, the WSJ\u2019s global economics editor, isn\u2019t getting carried away with excitement either: Don\u2019t forget, GDP estimates can go down as well as up. As our US business and economics editor Heidi Moore tweets, a growth rate of 4.0% per year may prove too good to be true: So, what drove the US recovery in the second quarter? Consumers played a big role. The Commerce Department says consumer spending grew by 2.5%, with Americans buying more long-lasting manufactured goods. Spending on services also rose. But some economists are worried that the growth figures are flattered because companies expanded their inventories \u2013 stocking up on goods and materials for the future. Inventory building provided around a third of the total growth recorded in Q2. Business investment, government spending and investment in home building all picked up too. And exports jumped by 9.5%, having slumped by 9.2% in the first quarter -- as ice and snow hampered US companies. The Commerce Department has also revised last year\u2019s GDP figures -- showing that America grew more rapidly than previously estimated in 2013. The revisions to Q1 GDP means that the US economy has grown by 0.9% so far this year. More good news. The US economy did not shrink as badly as feared in January-March. The Bureau of Economic Analysis has revised up its estimate of GDP in the quarter, to an annualised rate of -2.1%, from -2.9% before. Breaking: The US economy grew by 4% on an annualised basis in the second three months of 2014. That\u2019s a much stronger bounceback than expected, and means US GDP rose by 1.0% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. America has put its winter contraction firmly behind it -- that\u2019s going to calm some nerves. Bloomberg are calling it a \u201creally strong\u201d report. Encouragingly, business investment has risen strongly during the quarter -- by 5.5%. Lots more detail and reaction to follow! The waiting is nearly over.... We\u2019re about to find out whether the US economy has bounced back from its winter contraction. The first estimate of America\u2019s GDP for April-June is due shortly, at 8.30am Washington time or 1.30pm BST. Economists think GDP will rise by around 0.7% to 0.8% in the quarter, showing the economy is growing at an annualised rate of around 3%. A strong reading would suggest America\u2019s economy is back on track. A weak reading, though, will raise fears over the strength of the global recovery.... Interesting....trading has been suspended on the Moscow stock market. No reason was given, according to Reuters.... Russia\u2019s stock market has shrugged off the sanctions announced by the US authorities last night. The RTS index of the largest Russian companies has jumped by 2.3% so far today, with almost every share gaining ground. And the Russian currency has also strengthened, to 35.8 rubles to $1, from 35.8 last night. Moscow investors may have been reassured by Russia\u2018s central bank, which has pledged to support the financial institutions hit by US sanctions. In an online statement, the bank promised to \u201ctake adequate measures\u201d to support targeted institutions. The long term consequences of the deterioration of relations between Russia and the West could be severe, though. David Savage, sanctions expert at law firm Eversheds, warns that Russia\u2019s economic growth will suffer: \u201cThis latest wave of sanctions should come as no surprise. The impact of these far-reaching measures is as yet unknown, but with both the EU and the US imposing further restrictions on Russia\u2019s financial sector, as well its weapons and energy industries, it seems likely that the Russian economy will increasingly stagnate over the coming months. The corollary of this, of course, is that EU and US companies with Russian interests are also likely to experience some financial discomfort going forward.\u201d And there\u2019s a good piece in the FT about the end of a \u201c25-year chapter with Russia\u201d Barclays chief executive, Antony Jenkins, apparently supports the proposed tough rules for the City \u2018in principle\u2019: The British Bankers\u2019 Association is concerned that the new rules on bonus clawbacks and management accountability could make it hard for the City to hire and keep staff. Really? These new rules (details) should only affect bankers who make an almighty botch of the job \u2013 Britain\u2019s had its fair share of them, thanks. Associated Press is reporting that the central bank of Albania has been burgled, losing 713 million leke (or just over \u00a34m), from its reserve storage building. Two bank employees have been arrested, according to AP, which adds: The Bank of Albania, which is in charge of the country\u2019s price stability and manages 16 private banks, said Wednesday that the cash was stolen over time. It did not provide further details, but insisted that the bank\u2019s operations had not been affected and it was supplying the country\u2019s banking system with the necessary liquidity. Local media reported that one of the suspects acknowledged the theft over the last four years, saying he had spent much of the money on gambling. The bank, police and judicial authorities declined to comment on the report. Over to Greece where the government has forged ahead with a series of steps aimed clearly at placating international creditors and the population at large. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports on this week\u2019 developments: After appointing a new team to head the country\u2019s privatization agency \u2013 the fifth such change since 2012 - finance ministry officials signaled that a major shift in doing business with foreign lenders keeping the country afloat was also underway. Instead of holding talks in Athens, the next round of negotiations, currently scheduled for September, would take place in the neutral setting of Paris, they said, before mission chiefs and technical teams representing the EU, ECB and IMF wrap up the review with a quick visit to the Greek capital at the end of the month. \u201cThe spectre of the troika coming in for long, drawn out talks will, we hope, soon belong to the past,\u201d one insider confided. \u201cWe want to de-dramatise the process.\u201d With the prospect of early elections a distinct possibility if political parties fail to muster enough votes to elect a new president in February, the ruling coalition is keen to avoid political tensions at a time when the stridently anti-austerity main opposition Syriza party, the victor of Euro elections in May, is gaining ground. Prime minister Antonis Samaras has reportedly beseeched troika heads to change the location of the of talks for several months arguing that the presence of international monitors on such a regular basis in the Greek capital is not only fuel for the fire of anti-bailout but severely undermining for the government itself and the morale of Greeks at large. Ministers \u2013 targeted by anti-bailout protestors from unionists to sacked cleaners \u2013 have frequently complained of the drama surrounding such visits including the lack of respect the international mission chiefs have often displayed for politicians in Athens. The Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis, an economics professor appointed to the post in June, will no doubt see the change of tact as particularly encouraging, Helena adds: The no-nonsense Hardouvelis, who has promised to implement a number of reforms in what he says will be an \u201cAmerican August,\u201d has openly spoken of changing the timbre of relations with the troika, insisting that the enormous sacrifices made by Greeks have to be respected. The academic came to the job asking that lenders split their review of the economy in two parts between fiscal and structural goals and the finding gap the debt-stricken country s likely to face in 2015. Ministers hope the shift will help Athens negotiate a new memorandum that Greeks will feel they own \u2013 many currently feel that bailout terms have been thrust upon them. The government hopes, meanwhile, to show creditors that it also means business, tabling a huge omnibus bill of reforms in parliament on Tuesday signed by 13 ministers. The far-reaching legislation \u2013 changes range from new tax laws to relaxation of commercial activities on Greek seashores \u2013 is due to be voted on by August 8 and is key to the country receiving its next 1 bn euro aid installment in September. Similarly, Greek officials hope that the new team overseeing the sale of state assets will kick-start long delayed privatizations even if they also concede that the process will likely be linked to debt reduction talks that the government hopes to launch in the fall. Back in the eurozone, and Ireland\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 11.5% in the latest sign that its economy is slowly healing. The number of people on the \u2018Live Register\u2019 fell by 3,400 in July to 382,800, on a seasonally-adjusted basis. So far this year, the Irish jobless total has dropped by 8.5%. Some instant reaction to the new proposals to raise standards in British banking: (that\u2019s the clock will start ticking when the bonus is awarded, rather than waiting until they are actually paid) (this \u2018bright idea\u2019 was proposed by the ResPublica thinktank yesterday) It\u2019s official: British bankers could see their bonuses clawed back seven years after they are granted, under new rules to clean up the City. Bonuses will also be held back for longer, to give more time for incompetence or malpractice to come to light. Britain\u2019s financial watchdogs have also proposed a \u201cnew approval regime\u201d for senior executives who could cause \u201cserious harm\u201d to customers, or bring a bank crashing down. That will force banks to explain exactly who is responsible for what, making it harder for top bankers to evade responsibility. And new conduct rules will spell out the behaviour expected from them. The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) say their joint proposals \u201cwill make it easier for firms and regulators to hold individuals to account\u201d. Here are the key proposals to improve accountability: A new Senior Managers Regime which will clarify the lines of responsibility at the top of banks, enhance the regulators\u2019 ability to hold senior individuals in banks to account and require banks to regularly vet their senior managers for fitness and propriety; A Certification Regime requiring firms to assess fitness and propriety of staff in positions where the decisions they make who could pose significant harm to the bank or any of its customers; and A new set of Conduct Rules, which take the form of brief statements of high level principle, setting out the standards of behaviour for bank employees. And on pay: Increasing the alignment between risk and reward over the longer term, by requiring firms to defer payment of variable remuneration (e.g. bonuses) for a minimum of five or seven years depending on seniority, with a phased approach to vesting; Further enhancing the ability of firms to recover variable remuneration, even if paid out or vested, from senior management if risk management or conduct failings come to light at a later date; Options to address the problem that employees can sometimes evade the application of malus \u2013 reductions in unvested awards \u2013 by changing firms; and Strengthening the existing presumption against discretionary payments where banks have been bailed out. The PRA has also today published final rules on clawback which introduce a seven-year minimum period for clawback from the date of award. These rules will come into force on 1 January 2015. Back to Barclays\u2019 results -- and City experts are scratching their heads wondering why it has stopped telling us how much money is being set aside for its investment bankers. City editor Jill Treanor explains: One of the numbers analysts and journalists look for in Barclays\u2019 numbers is the compensation to income ratio - a measure how much of income is being kept aside to pay investment bankers. In the first quarter of the year, the figure was 46%, as set out here on p16. But it seems Barclays, which has been publishing this number on a quarterly basis, is no longer going to do so. The number is not there in the interim results published today and the finance director said today \u201cwe don\u2019t disclose this at the half year\u201d. What price transparency? City veteran Christopher Wheeler isn\u2019t impressed: Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, has just welcomed Allied Irish Bank\u2019s first profit since the crisis: IRISH FIN MIN SAYS ALLIED IRISH BANKS RETURN TO PROFITABILITY VERY GOOD NEWS FOR TAXPAYER, MAKES IT A MORE VALUABLE BANK One of Ireland\u2019s state-owned banks is back profit for the first time since the financial crash that brought the Republic to the brink of national bankruptcy. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports on this landmark moment in Ireland\u2019s recovery. Allied Irish Bank, which was rescued by the taxpayer, reported today it has made a \u20ac437m profit in the first six months of 2014. The AIB received more than 20 billion euros in state aid since 2009 and was one of the banks that over-lent to builders and property speculators during the Celtic Tiger boom. In Northern Ireland and Britain AIB operates under the name First Trust Bank. Return to profitability comes as the Irish banking sector prepares for a European wide financial stress test in the autumn carried out by the European Central Bank. The head of AIB, which is still 99.8% owned by tax payers, said the recovery in the overall Irish economy had helped the bank back to profitability. AIB\u2019s chief executive officer, David Duffy, said the bank had \u201cachieved its stated aim of returning to sustainable profitability\u201d with its half year results \u201creflecting strong improvements\u201d in its performance in several areas. \u201cAs the Irish economy and the bank recovers, we remain focused on growth and maximising value for the Irish State, as 99.8% shareholder, and all other stakeholders over time,\u201d he said. But like all Irish banks, AIB still faces a major problem \u2013 tens of thousands of home owners are still in mortgage arrears, with many of them trapped in negative equity. Britain\u2019s energy regulator, which has faced accusations of toothlessness in the past, has announced new price proposals that will cut bills, a little. Ofgem\u2019s plan will see UK electricity bills fall by \u00a31 per month on average, and will also lead to distribution companies spending \u00a317bn upgrading the UK\u2019s energy network. More here: UK electricity bills to fall by \u00a312 a year, Ofgem says Two more UK firms, British American Tobacco and contract caterer Compass, have warned that the strong pound is eating into their profits. The Brazil World Cup has helped ITV post a 40% surge in pre-tax profits. CEO Adam Crozier says. \u201cIn the first six months of the year, we again delivered double-digit profit growth in every area of the business and increased revenues by 7%. Rightmove is benefitting from the upturn in the UK property sector, with revenue up 20%. While new low-calorie sandwiches and a better hot drinks range has lured more customers into Greggs - the UK bakery chain has posted a 3% rise in sales, and a 48% surge in profits. Heads-up. British bankers are about to be told that they\u2019ll face some of the strictest bonus regulations in the world. The proposal won\u2019t stop huge payments being handed out, but they will give authorities the ability to claw back bonuses within the next seven years. This would mean that a banker could be forced to return the cash if unexpected losses come to light, or unexpected losses. The banking watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority, will announce the plans at 10am. Sky News reckons the PRA has abandoned the idea of making the bonus rules retrospective, though. David Roman of the Wall Street Journal also flags up that Spain\u2019s economy is outpacing most European rivals. Economists say this level of growth [+0.6% in Q2] is likely to make Spain the best or one of the best economic performers in the euro zone in the quarter, largely due to a series of effective economic reforms and because of a rebound effect after a long economic slump Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi reckon\u2019s Spain\u2019s economy is growing faster than the experts predicted. The Spanish economy does now appear to be outperforming the rest of the eurozone -- which is most unlikely to match Spain\u2019s 0.6% growth in the last three months. Both France and Germany are expected to report lacklustre growth. Spain has taken another major step away from the darkest days of the eurozone crisis, by posting its strongest growth since the financial crisis began. Spanish GDP rose by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2014, its National Statistics Institute reported. That\u2019s stronger than the 0.5% expected, and means growth accelerated from the 0.4% growth in January-March. Over the last year, Spanish GDP has risen by 1.2%. Another welcome signal that the Spanish economy is recovering \u2013 hopefully it will drag down its record unemployment levels (currently 24.5%). However, Spain is also being hit by the deflationary pressures in the eurozone. New inflation figures, also just released, show that the consumer prices index fell by 0.3% annually in July. That means that nominal GDP (growth plus inflation) remains weak, at just +0.3. No major drama on Barclays\u2019 early conference call. Finance director Tushar Morzaria did confirm that US authorities have another year to assess whether its foreign exchange operations have broken the law (as Jill flagged up earlier). Reuters sums it up: BARCLAYS FINANCE DIRECTOR SAYS NET HEADCOUNT DOWN JUST UNDER 5,000 SO FAR THIS YEAR BARCLAYS FINANCE DIRECTOR SAYS NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT WITH US DOJ EXTENDED BY 1 YEAR MAINLY FOR FURTHER ASSESSMENT OF FX MARKET ACTIVITIES BARCLAYS FINANCE DIRECTOR SAYS CONFIDENT LEVERAGE RATIO WILL BE GREATER THAN 4 PCT IN 2016 AND BEYOND Joshua Raymond of City Index is worried that Barclays investment bank suffered such a steep fall in profits, down almost 50% in the last six months. He warns: What will be troubling for some investors is not just the fact that investment banking continues to sap underlying numbers for the group as a whole, but the deterioration in the last quarter and the potential impact on the group\u2019s full-year performance unless market activity picks up. Barclays shares have jumped 3% at the start of trading, putting it at the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. City traders clearly aren\u2019t worried that it has set aside another \u00a3900m to compensate PPI customers, or that profits at its investment bank halved. There are some encouraging signs in today\u2019s results. For example, Barclays\u2019 Personal and Corporate Banking division has cut its bad loans, thanks to \u201cthe improving UK economic environment\u201d.. Buried in Barclays results statement is the news that the US Department of Justice has extended its \u201cnon-prosecution agreement\u201d for another year. That gives the DoJ another 12 months to decide whether Barclays foreign exchange operations have broken any US laws. Several inquiries are underway into whether FX traders conspired to fix currency rates. Britain\u2019s PPI mis-selling scandal has taken another twist this morning. Barclays, Britain\u2019s third-biggest bank, has hiked its provision for compensating customers who were wrongly sold payment protection insurance protection by a futher \u00a3900m. That pushes Barclays total PPI bill towards \u00a35bn -- a remarkable bill for selling insurance products which its customers simply didn\u2019t need. Not quite the image that CEO \u201cSt\u201d Antony Jenkins is striving for. The news comes as Barclays reports a 7% drop in underlying profits. Earnings were driven down by a weaker performance at from investment banking, where revenues slumped by 18% and profits almost halved. Jenkins, who is trying to reshape Barclays and shrink the investment bank, says: Performance in the Investment Bank was impacted by the repositioning underway as well as difficult trading conditions in the quarter, but it is where we expected it to be at this point. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Has America\u2019s economy bounced back from the shock of its winter slowdown? We\u2019ll find out today (1.30pm) UK time, when the first estimate of US GDP for April-June is released. Economists predict strong growth, of at least 0.7% to 0.8%, or 3% on an annualised basis. That would reverse the unexpected slump in January-March, when annualised GDP shrank by 2.9% as grim winter weather gripped America. If that doesn\u2019t happen, it will spark fresh concerns over the state of the global economy. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: For some time now we\u2019ve heard all manner of speculation that the slowdown in the US economy seen in Q1 was an aberration, caused by the worst winter in living memory. The slowdown in Q1, we were told, would be more than offset by a strong bounce back in Q2. World financial markets will be watching Argentina nervously. It has until the end of today to reach an agreement with its holdout bondholders, or else default on the debt. Talks have been taking place in New York in a final bid to cut a deal: Last-ditch New York talks on Argentina debt Investors will also be digesting the latest raft of sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and EU last night, targeting weapons, energy and finance. Three large banks \u2013 VTB Bank OAO, Bank of Moscow and the Russian Agricultural Bank \u2013 have been cut off from the US economy. Lots of corporate results today, led by Barclays, which is holding a conference call at 8am. A clutch of other companies, including ITV, Taylor Wimpey, Rightmove and Greggs, are also reporting. And then tonight, the US Federal Reserve ends its monthly meeting -- it\u2019s likely to trim its bond-buying stimulus programme by another $10bn/month. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day.",

Separately, Astra was one of a number of companies said to be interested in a possible \u20ac6.5 a share bid for German drug discovery group Evotec, valuing the business at nearly \u00a3600m. America's Johnson &amp; Johnson was also mentioned by traders as another potential bidder. But Antofagasta fell 39p to 816p despite beating forecasts with a near 6% quarter on quarter increase in second quarter copper output to 178,000. Analysts were concerned about the outlook for copper prices. Other miners were also weaker. BHP Billiton lost 48p to \u00a320.48, while Rio Tinto was 41p lower at \u00a334.34 after selling its Mozambique coal assets at a knock down price. Among the mid-caps Pace dropped 24.5p to 337.4p as Liberum cut its target price from 420p to 390p in the wake of this week's news of the unexpected departure of its finance director. Liberum said: We leave estimates broadly unchanged. Pace needs its strongest ever half in the second half of 2014 to reach full year revenue guidance. The sudden departure of the highly regarded finance director may suggest there were internal disagreements over strategy. The 10% free cash flow yield should provide support, but longer term uncertainties remain. Moneysupermarket.com added 3.4p to 185.4p after half year profits rose 9% to \u00a394.4m. Finally construction group Keller fell 23p to 890p after it said it would take a \u00a330m charge relating to a dispute over a project completed in 2008. The charge relates to purported defects in a floor slab at a warehouse, but may be covered by insurance. Analysts at Liberum said: [This is an] unexpected announcement regarding a legacy contract triggering a \u00a330m exceptional charge. The outcome is uncertain but may be significantly less bad than the headline suggests (it may be covered in full by insurance). A short term share price hit is inevitable but we would buy on weakness: the shares are cheap, offer substantial margin recovery potential and the balance sheet is strong.",

One member of the Public Accounts Committee, Richard Bacon, asked at the time: \"When you have sick patients \u2026 can you really trust Vladimir Putin to be their major supplier?\" But fast forward seven years and it seems those warnings have not been heeded. As David Cameron called for tougher sanctions against Putin's administration last week, Gazprom Energy was quietly supplying gas to a range of high-profile customers \u2013 including a number of hospital trusts. The company declined to divulge details but the NHS confirmed Gazprom Energy supplies several trusts in north-west England in contracts worth \u00a312m. But its NHS operations are just one element of Gazprom Energy's spectacular growth. Its business customers across the UK range from local authorities to cinema chains, universities to high street shops and schools. Surveying this growing empire, the company's new global head of retail, Lars Clausen, told its quarterly magazine Energise his aim was to turn Gazprom Energy into \"the pan-European leader\" in its field. \"There are great opportunities; we can learn from what we've done well in the UK and bring that to Europe.\" One of the things competitors say the company has done well in the UK is use its financial muscle to undercut their rivals on price. But a spokesman said its success was based on \"offering sophisticated and bespoke energy solutions to corporate clients\" rather than simply cut-price gas. He added: \"Gazprom Energy offers its clients flexibility, tailored to their specific business needs. It's not about [the] lowest rate and never has been \u2013 it's about designing an energy plan that meets the needs of the client at a good value for money.\" The Greenpeace UK energy campaigner Louise Hutchins said it was time to end a system where Cameron talked tough about slapping sanctions on Russia while presiding over an energy system that ploughs millions into the Kremlin's coffers. \"Every time ministers have scrapped funds for domestic clean technologies and failed to cut energy waste, they've made Putin's oligarchs a bit richer and Britain's energy security a bit weaker. \"This is the price we pay for our addiction to fossil fuels, along with climate change, air pollution, and volatile energy prices. If ministers are serious about bulking up our energy security then the cheapest, easiest, fastest way to achieve this is cutting waste and backing clean, home-grown, high-tech power sources.\"",

Attempts by Greggs to reinvent itself as a healthier, Pret a Manger-style coffee shop chain are starting to pay off with half-year profits up nearly 50%. The bakery chain, with 1,661 stores in Britain, introduced a range of freshly made sandwiches with fewer than 400 calories, and less salt and sugar. Its coffee blend has been changed, according to Greggs, to \"make it taste smoother\". Under its new boss, Roger Whiteside, Greggs has also been refitting its stores and adding more seating to tap into the unabated growth in coffee shops in Britain. Opening hours have been extended by half an hour in the morning and the evening (many Greggs shops are now open from 7am until 5.30pm) to catch people on their way into work and on their way home. Low commodity price inflation (such as lower pork and wheat prices) and the increasing tendency to eat food on the go are also boosting sales. Greggs' finance director, Richard Hutton, said: \"We want to make sure we keep pace with changing taste. People have developed a taste for good coffee and healthy food.\" But he added: \"We still sell more sausage rolls than anything else, more than 100m a year. You will still see the sausage roll as a snack. It has 350 calories. There's nothing to worry about for the sausage roll.\" But even that Greggs stalwart is becoming healthier. The firm has reduced the salt content of its pastry by 30% in the last couple of years. \"We do it gradually and over time,\" Hutton said. \"If the product doesn't taste great, people will vote with their feet.\" Freshly prepared food \u2013 Greggs plans new fresh soup and hot sandwich ranges come autumn and winter \u2013 sets the bakery group apart from the big coffee shop chains, which bring pre-prepared sandwiches in from suppliers, Hutton said. \"Greggs has a similar model to Pret. We have a similar supply chain, although we own our own bakeries, Pret don't. Both are about good food made fresh.\" The company's sales rose 3% to \u00a3373m in the first half of the year, lifting pre-tax profits to \u00a317m. The house brokers, UBS and N+1 Singer, upgraded their full-year forecast by \u00a32m to \u00a348m-\u00a349m. Greggs credited its new ranges as well as \"more settled\" weather than last year and the economic recovery. It acknowledged its numbers were flattered by weak trading in 2013, a year when it issued two profit warnings and blamed hot weather, cold weather and \"promiscuous shoppers\" for its problems. Last August it launched a five-year plan to revamp itself to keep up with the food-on-the-go market. Sales began to pick up at the end of the year, but a decision to scrap dozens of in-store bakeries and a management cull led to the loss of 400 jobs. The company has abandoned plans to increase its total number of stores, but plans to spend \u00a350m to upgrade 200 shops this year.",

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has struck a deal worth more than $2bn (\u00a31.2bn) to buy the rights to Spanish firm Almirall's lung drugs, as part of efforts to build up its respiratory-medicines portfolio. Britain's second-largest drugmaker has announced a string of smaller deals to boost key areas since fighting off a \u00a369bn takeover attempt from bigger US rival Pfizer in May. The firm also signed a clinical trial collaboration with the Japan's Kyowa Hakko Kirin for a study that will assess combinations of the two companies' cancer immunotherapy treatments, another key area. AstraZeneca has said it will pay $875m upfront to Almirall and up to $1.2bn more if the drugs meet development and sales targets. It is acquiring the right to develop and sell Almirall's existing lung treatments, such as the recently launched Eklira, as well as its pipeline of new therapies. This will help fill some gaps in AstraZeneca's portfolio as key medicines come off patent. Andrew Baum, an analyst at Citigroup said: \"AstraZeneca continues to build out its business and smooth out its medium-term earnings profile with strategic, modestly sized, low-risk transactions. Today's announcement with Almirall adds complementary delivery devices and broadens AstraZeneca's respiratory portfolio within ex-US markets.\" Others were more sceptical about the latest deal. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the deal would \"bolster one of AstraZeneca's growth platforms\", but added: \"We see a significant overlap with the recently acquired Pearl's assets, which could raise questions about AstraZeneca's strategy in respiratory.\" Last year, AstraZeneca agreed to buy Californian respiratory specialist Pearl Therapeutics for up to $1.15bn, which gave it a new class of lung treatments known as LABA/LAMA drugs. Some analysts believe these will dominate the future treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which affects about 210 million people worldwide. AstraZeneca is trailing behind rivals such as GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis in the race to develop the new class of drugs. AstraZeneca is due to report its second-quarter results on Thursday, when its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, will set out its strategy as an independent company. He has already pledged to lift revenues by three-quarters to $45bn by 2023, a target considered ambitious by many analysts. Pfizer, for its part, said it was still considering big deals when it released quarterly figures on Tuesday, but refused to say whether it would renew its advances towards AstraZeneca. Under UK takeover rules, it would be able to do so from late August if invited back to the negotiating table by the British firm. Baum said there was a 25% chance of this happening, and noted that the companies would not have to announce this to the stock market.",

      "body": "<p>You can't go far wrong with animal pictures on TV and the internet, and <strong>Pets at Home</strong> is taking full advantage of that fact.</p> <p>The company has reported first quarter underlying sales up 4.1%, helped by television and online advertising campaign. It said:</p> <blockquote> We...returned to TV advertising during the quarter and have been pleased with the very positive reaction to MyPetMoments, with clips crowd sources from our customers. The full length online advertisement has now been viewed over 1.2m times. <br> </blockquote> <p>With plenty of owners keen to pamper their pets, the company's groom rooms and VIP loyalty scheme are also helping to drive growth. It is also strong in animal healthcare, with a growing number of small vetinary surgeries.</p> <p>It currently has 386 stores, 300 vets and 150 groom rooms. During the current financial year it plans to open 25 stores, 60 vets, and 50 salons .</p> <p>The company's shares have jumped 13.8p or 8% to 183.8p following the update.</p> <p>But they are still well short of March's float price of 245p. Analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> Like B&amp;M on Monday, Pets At Home has, unexpectedly come out with a trading update today and though it was apparently \"planned\" the update is no doubt partly timed to respond to the recent alarming weakness in its share price. <br> The news is reassuring, with first quarter (the 16 weeks to July 17) like for like sales up by 4.1%, \"driven by VIP Club momentum, strength in Advanced Nutrition and Health &amp; Hygiene, and continued growth of our veterinary practices and Groom Rooms\", but towards the end of the statement Pets admit that the comparisons were quite soft at the end of the period, given the heatwave last year. </blockquote> <p>Nomura repeated its buy rating, saying:</p> <blockquote> Overall first quarter delivery provides us with comfort around our current full year expectations. <br> For the full year we look for 3.2% growth in like for like sales and an 8.5% rise in total sales.  We highlight that services revenue growth in particular continues to be an important differentiator to the Pets at Home story given the joint venture model for Vets drives high-margin contribution growth.

      "bodyText": "You can't go far wrong with animal pictures on TV and the internet, and Pets at Home is taking full advantage of that fact. The company has reported first quarter underlying sales up 4.1%, helped by television and online advertising campaign. It said: We...returned to TV advertising during the quarter and have been pleased with the very positive reaction to MyPetMoments, with clips crowd sources from our customers. The full length online advertisement has now been viewed over 1.2m times. With plenty of owners keen to pamper their pets, the company's groom rooms and VIP loyalty scheme are also helping to drive growth. It is also strong in animal healthcare, with a growing number of small vetinary surgeries. It currently has 386 stores, 300 vets and 150 groom rooms. During the current financial year it plans to open 25 stores, 60 vets, and 50 salons . The company's shares have jumped 13.8p or 8% to 183.8p following the update. But they are still well short of March's float price of 245p. Analyst Nick Bubb said: Like B&amp;M on Monday, Pets At Home has, unexpectedly come out with a trading update today and though it was apparently \"planned\" the update is no doubt partly timed to respond to the recent alarming weakness in its share price. The news is reassuring, with first quarter (the 16 weeks to July 17) like for like sales up by 4.1%, \"driven by VIP Club momentum, strength in Advanced Nutrition and Health &amp; Hygiene, and continued growth of our veterinary practices and Groom Rooms\", but towards the end of the statement Pets admit that the comparisons were quite soft at the end of the period, given the heatwave last year. Nomura repeated its buy rating, saying: Overall first quarter delivery provides us with comfort around our current full year expectations. For the full year we look for 3.2% growth in like for like sales and an 8.5% rise in total sales. We highlight that services revenue growth in particular continues to be an important differentiator to the Pets at Home story given the joint venture model for Vets drives high-margin contribution growth. The use of the group's loyalty VIP programme and recent TV advertising continues to support merchandise mix favourably too...
