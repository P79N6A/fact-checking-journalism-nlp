The question is whether they will rise enough to worry policymakers into tightening policy sooner than currently envisaged. </p> <p>The general expectation is that inflation is likely to continue to run at or below the Bank of England's 2.0% target for some time, subdued by lower import costs, resulting in turn from sterling's appreciation this year, as well as lower global commodity and energy prices. This means policymakers have greater leeway to keep interest rates at the record low of 0.5% for longer, as the economy goes through a 'sweet spot' of robust economic growth, falling unemployment and low inflation. </p> <p>\"The big uncertainty is pay growth, a revival of which will threaten the Bank's easy-money stance. The potential for wages to start rising strongly should not be underestimated, given the speed with which the labour market is improving. The latest official data showed average wages and salaries rising 1.4% on a year ago in the three months to January. While this means the squeeze on real pay from inflation is now at it lowest since April 2010, helping to engender a long-awaited consumer fell-good factor, it raises the possibility that the Bank could grow more worried about the possibility of wage growth in inflation is wager growth accelerates. There are already some signs of this: d<a href=\"http://www.markit.com/assets/en/docs/commentary/markit-economics/2014/mar/UK_labour_market_14_03_19.pdf\">igging deeper into the official data</a> reveals that pay growth has already in fact risen to an inflation-busting 3.2% in manufacturing, 3.0% in construction and 3.7% in retail, hotels and restaurants. Weak financial services and public sector pay growth remains an overall drag on earnings, but elsewhere the tightening labour market is finally feeding through to higher real-terms pay. </p> <p>Without the fall in inflation, there would undoubtedly be a rising clamour for policymakers to tighten policy to ward off fears of overheating, especially given the recent housing market upturn. Key to how long the Bank of England can keep rates low therefore will be earnings growth. If we see growth of wages and salaries pick up sharply in coming months, concerns about the feed-through to higher inflation will intensify, as will the pressure on policymakers to take some of the heat out of the economy via a first hike in interest rates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-03-25T10:01:25.305Z\">at 10.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5331500de4b038e10603ca03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-25T09:46:15.345Z\">9.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Also out just now, <b>factory-gate inflation in the UK has eased to the lowest since October 2009</b>. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53314eebe4b038e10603ca00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-25T09:41:38.805Z\">9.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to the German Ifo business morale number, which fell to a five-month low.

The Ifo index dropped in March to 110.7, from 111.3 in February. While the expectations component weakened as a result of the Crimean crisis, the current assessment component continued its impressive upward trend and reached the highest level since April 2012.<br>  The German economy is gaining momentum. The exceptionally mild weather has given an enormous boost to construction activity, with new orders in construction up by more than 10% yoy in January. In addition, the well-known growth drivers like the strong labour market, low inventories and filled order books are also doing their work.  Looking ahead, two factors will be highly important for the future path of the German economy: external demand and domestic investment. As regards external demand, risks and uncertainties have clearly increased since the start of the year. The slowdown in some emerging market economies, the Russian-Ukrainian crisis and, above all, concerns about the Chinese economy do not bode well for German exports. As regards domestic investment, this is the growth wild card for the German economy. Weak domestic investment has become one of the unpleasant characteristics of the economic performance of the last ten years. In our view, weak private investment is a result of structural and cyclical factors. While cyclical factors have clearly improved, as eg favourable financing conditions and record high gross operating surpluses of German companies, uncertainty and production facilities which are not yet used to capacity could put a speed limit on investment growth. Capacity utilization rates, for example, are still clearly below past peak levels.  All in all, today\u2019s Ifo index sends two messages: the German economy has again entered the fast lane in the first quarter but continuing the ride at maximum speed will not be an easy task.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-533147c0e4b038e10603c9f6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-03-25T09:11:49.655Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German business confidence shows first fall in five months</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>German business confidence has fallen for the first time in five months, not surprising given Germany's exposure to Russia and China. </b>The latest business climate index from the Munich-based think tank Ifo has dropped to 110.7 in March from 111.3 in February.

      "bodyText": "After days in the doldrums, stock markets have regained some of the recent lost ground. Continuing concerns about Ukraine seem to have been outweighed by talk of possible stimulus measures by Chinese authorities to boost the country's flagging economy, not to mention a host of positive corporate updates. The dovish comments from various members of the European Central Bank (see here onwards) has also helped sentiment. So the closing prices showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 84.5 points or 1.3% higher at 6604.89 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 1.63% to 9338.4 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.59% higher at 4344.12 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.95% better at 20,823.16 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 0.78% to 9990.5 * Russia's Micex closed 2.04% higher at 1324.44 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 120 points or 0.74%. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece it\u2019s been a different sort of day today as the country put on a military extravaganza to mark its Independence Day \u2013 with a show that officials said highlighted its exit from economic crisis. Helena Smith in Athens writes: For the first time since the start of the debt crisis, authorities went all out putting much of the country's military arsenal on display as the nation marked the day that commemorates the start of Greece\u2019s 1821 war of Independence against the Ottoman Empire. Fighter jets and Apache helicopters flew overhead as tanks (many ironically procured from Germany) rolled down the streets. The extravanza had been put on hold by the former socialist prime minister George Papandreou when Greece was forced to turn to the EU, ECB and IMF for emergency rescue funds to avert bankruptcy in May 2010. But addressing reporters after the parade, the defence minister Dimitirs Avramopoulos said the display had sent \u201ca message of self-confidence\u201d that highlighted the country\u2019s economic recovery. \u201cNow that Greece has got through the worst, let us all work together for the better things that are on the horizon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have sent with this grand parade that so many thousands of Athenians and all of Greece has watched, a message of strength and peace \u2026 the Greece of crisis very shortly will not exist [because] the Greece of pride, self-confidence and strength is coming.\u201d The Greek president Karolos Papoulias went further likening the nation\u2019s fight for freedom to the battle against foreign lenders much blamed for a four-year diet of austerity that has plunged the country into prolonged recession and record levels of poverty and unemployment. \u201cToday our people are waging a struggle to break the encirclement of creditors,\u201d the 84-year-old head of state told reporters. \u201cOur history guarantees that this fight will be victorious.\u201d With the plight of ordinary Greeks, hit by successive pay and pension cuts and tax increases worst than it has even been, the display of military might has been quick to spark controversy. Papandreou\u2019s decision is believed to have brought down costs dramatically - from \u20ac3.1m to \u20ac350,000 for national day celebrations and those marking OXI day commemorating the beginning of Greece\u2019s participation in World War II. Security was such that with the exception of a smattering of invited officials, Greeks were unable to even get close to the parade. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an outdated display of nationalism that has no place in Europe but an incredible waste of money at a time when economically things are better but nowhere near as successful as the government makes out,\u201d the political commentator Paschos Mandravelis told the Guardian. \u201cA lot of money has been spent needlessly on fuel and transport of all this equipment and to make things worse, most Greeks weren\u2019t even able to see the parade. \u201c Here is the official statement on the Lloyds share sale: Intention to Dispose c. 7.5% Lloyds Banking Group The news came after the market closed so has had no effect on the Lloyds shares price, which ended 0.61p higher at 79.11p. The government has just announced it plans to sell 5.35bn Lloyds Banking Group shares, or 7.5% of the group, in a placing to institutional investors. This will cut the government's stake from 32.7% to around 25% and would raise just over \u00a34bn at the current 79p share price. And after the comments from members of the European Central Bank's council on the prospect of further stimulus measures, comes president Mario Draghi himself, echoing the same theme. Speaking in Paris, the ECB president said the central bank was ready to act if inflation slipped lower than it expected, that is, rising to 1% this year, 1.3% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016, according to Reuters. He said: If any downside risks to this scenario appear, we stand ready to take additional monetary policy measures that ensure our mandate is fulfilled. We will do what is needed to maintain price stability. Earlier various members of the ECB had hinted at the possible measures, including negative deposit rates and quantitative easing. Draghi also said banks should take prompt action to fix any problems before the ECB unveiled its health checks on the sector, due in October. He said: The cleaning up of bank balance sheets does not need to wait for the end of this assessment. The best outcome is one where banks are forward looking and take any corrective action before the end of the process. And he concluded: Winston Churchill said that \u201cto achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan, and not quite enough time\u201d. I hope that I have made clear today that we do have a plan. And since we certainly have no time to spare, I trust that, if we remain resolute, great things for the euro area and its citizens can become possible. The full speech is here: A consistent strategy for a sustained recovery It's been a busy day for European Central Bank members opining about future stimulus measures. Finland's central bank governor and ECB council member Erkki Liikanen told the Wall Street Journal that it was open to negative interest rates: Setting a negative deposit rate to guard against excessively low inflation is an option for the European Central Bank, said...Liikanen, the latest indication that officials are willing to provide fresh stimulus to protect a fragile economic recovery. \"If you want to tackle the issues with traditional monetary policy, then you should be able to cut rates further. We are at low levels but we haven't exhausted our maneuvering room,\" Mr. Liikanen told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. \"The question of negative deposit rates, in my mind, isn't any longer a controversial issue,\" he said. The full interview is here: ECB's Liikanen: Open to Negative Deposit Rate More US housing data. New home sales fell 3.3% month on month in February to 440,000. This is around 1.1% lower than a year ago. Teunis Brosens at ING said: This is really not that bad at all, given bad weather conditions in parts of the country. Homebuilders did have to accept a median sales price that was 1.2% lower than a year ago. Homebuilders themselves have become a bit more cautious about the outlook for sales, and we agree with them on that. Further drops in new home sales and/or prices cannot be excluded. Weekly mortgage applications have not yet staged a recovery and are still about 15% lower than a year ago. Earlier today, the January Case-Shiller 20-City home price index posted a 0.8% month on month increase (see below). Prices are now 13.2% higher than a year ago, down from a peak of 13.7% year on year back in November. Prices have been holding up quite well so far, despite the fact that January sales were 5% lower than a year earlier. The delayed effects of bad weather, but also higher mortgage rates and a slowly increasing inventory should further slow prices in the months ahead. We expect price rises to drop to single-digit numbers in a few months\u2019 time. With this, it is time to hand over to Nick Fletcher. Thankyou for all your comments. JK Wall Street has opened higher, buoyed by a strong consumer confidence report. Confidence hit a six-year high in March, the latest sign that the economy is regaining momentum after a period of dismal weather. The Conference Boar's index of consumer attitudes rose to 82.3, the highest since January 2008, from 78.3 in February. The Dow Jones opened up 0.6%, the S&amp;P was 0.5% ahead and the Nasdaq 0.7% higher. The standoff over Crimea continues, with G-7 leaders warning Russia of further sanctions if Putin took further action to destabilise Ukraine following the annexation of Crimea. Ukraine is in talks with the International Monetary Fund about a loan package worth $15-20bn. The Ukrainian finance minister, Oleksander Shlapak, said the ministry expected the economy to contract by 3% this year. He was confident of getting the loan package. Over in the US, and a house price survey has shown prices rose by slightly more than expected in January. The S&amp;P/Case-Schiller index of US single family home prices rose 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted month on month basis, compared to forecasts of a 0.7% increase. The year on year increase was 13.2%. On a non seasonally adjusted basis, they dipped 0.1% month on month, which was of course blamed on the cold weather. Chairman of the index committee David Blitzer said, as quoted by Reuters: The housing recovery may have taken a breather due to the cold weather. [But] from the bottom in 2012, prices are up 23% and the housing market is showing signs of moving forward with more normal price increases. More from the European Central Bank, and governing council member Jozef Makuch has also been talking about quantitative easing. He said the ECB was preparing \"non-standard\" measures to avoid deflation, with a number of ECB board members prepared to take decisive steps if necessary. He said there was no reason not to support QE if the circumstances showed it was needed, but there was also no reason to predict his future stance now. The euro fell today, after the European Central Bank stepped up its rhetoric about curbing the single currency's strength. Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, a member of the ECB's governing council, said the ECB could use interest rates to counter strong gains in the euro. He also said it it was not out of the question for the central bank to buy assets from banks to fight deflation \u2013 a softening of the Bundesbank's strict stance on quantitative easing. The euro dropped 0.2% to $1.3808. The Treasury Committee session has finished. Watch out for the head of the OBR Robert Chote tomorrow afternoon and George Osborne next Thursday. Asked about the cap on welfare spending and whether it will improve policy making in the future, Johnson says: Setting it five years ahead with a 2% and a bit margin, I suspect, will not last. It would bite much harder if we were to move into a deep recession. He thinks it could lead to \"more active decision making\". Earlier, Citi's Michael Saunders suggested in front of the Treasury Committee that delaying fiscal tightening to the next parliament creates political risk. IFS director Paul Johnson says Beyond 2015/16 we haven't heard from this government what the spending cuts are. There are three years of very big spending cuts pencilled in and we know next to nothing about what they are. More on the UK data front: The CBI's latest survey shows retail sales growth slowing in March but shops remain optimistic for next month. The retail sales balance for March dropped to 13 from 37 in February (and compared with City forecasts of 28), but the expectations balance was the highest since December 2010 at 36, versus 28 for March. Without taking a break, MPs on Treasury Committee are now going to quiz the Institute for Fiscal Studies on the budget, following the session with the City economists. At the Treasury Committee hearing into the budget, Citi's Michael Saunders has noted that a lot of the planned fiscal tightening won't happen until after the election. Fiscal tightening equivalent to 5% of GDP has been pencilled in for the next parliament. Whether that will be achieved depends on who the next government is, MPs say. Saunders concludes: There is uncertainty as to how the current coalition would achieve that target. They haven't spelled out their plans either. Meanwhile, the TUC is not that impressed by the fall in inflation. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: The longest fall in living standards continues. Lower inflation is good news, but this cannot hide the longest cut in real wages since the 1870s. An average worker is getting nine pounds in pay for every ten pounds they were getting before the crash. Pay packets are about the same level that they were ten years ago. These figures underline just how far we have to go to restore living standards so that ordinary people share in the recovery. Britain needs a pay rise. Indebted households are the next topic. Saunders is quite optimistic about households deleveraging. He says that the debt to income ratio is back to 2003 levels and is still falling, with incomes growing at twice the pace of debt. We don't at the moment have credit-led growth; we are deleveraging more slowly. Back to the Treasury Committee. Michael Saunders, head of European Economics at Citi, has just noted that business investment is \"really low as a share of GDP\". Figures from the British Bankers' Association showed this morning that banks approved fewer mortgages in February than in January while the total amount of lending to buy homes rose to its highest level in nearly two years. Mortgages for homes purchases slipped back to 47,550 last month, down from 49,341 in January which was the highest level since 2007. BBA data don't include lending by building societies, which are included in separate Bank of England data next due for release on 31 March. The ONS reported house prices up 0.6% month-on-month and 6.8% year-on-year in January. The Treasury Committee hearing into the budget has got under way. You can watch it live here. Chris Williamson, chief economist at data group Markit, notes that the fall in inflation to 1.7%, a four-year low, enables the Bank of England to keep interest rates low for longer. The big uncertainty for the outlook for inflation lies with wages and salaries, which are finally starting to show signs of rising. The question is whether they will rise enough to worry policymakers into tightening policy sooner than currently envisaged. The general expectation is that inflation is likely to continue to run at or below the Bank of England's 2.0% target for some time, subdued by lower import costs, resulting in turn from sterling's appreciation this year, as well as lower global commodity and energy prices. This means policymakers have greater leeway to keep interest rates at the record low of 0.5% for longer, as the economy goes through a 'sweet spot' of robust economic growth, falling unemployment and low inflation. \"The big uncertainty is pay growth, a revival of which will threaten the Bank's easy-money stance. The potential for wages to start rising strongly should not be underestimated, given the speed with which the labour market is improving. The latest official data showed average wages and salaries rising 1.4% on a year ago in the three months to January. While this means the squeeze on real pay from inflation is now at it lowest since April 2010, helping to engender a long-awaited consumer fell-good factor, it raises the possibility that the Bank could grow more worried about the possibility of wage growth in inflation is wager growth accelerates. There are already some signs of this: digging deeper into the official data reveals that pay growth has already in fact risen to an inflation-busting 3.2% in manufacturing, 3.0% in construction and 3.7% in retail, hotels and restaurants. Weak financial services and public sector pay growth remains an overall drag on earnings, but elsewhere the tightening labour market is finally feeding through to higher real-terms pay. Without the fall in inflation, there would undoubtedly be a rising clamour for policymakers to tighten policy to ward off fears of overheating, especially given the recent housing market upturn. Key to how long the Bank of England can keep rates low therefore will be earnings growth. If we see growth of wages and salaries pick up sharply in coming months, concerns about the feed-through to higher inflation will intensify, as will the pressure on policymakers to take some of the heat out of the economy via a first hike in interest rates. Also out just now, factory-gate inflation in the UK has eased to the lowest since October 2009. Back to the German Ifo business morale number, which fell to a five-month low. The monthly survey is based on a poll of some 7,000 firms. Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters: In view of the Crimea crisis, a certain caution has returned to the German economy. The word 'uncertainty' would be too strong. There are so far no concrete effects on the German economy. David Brown of New View Economics was more pessimistic: The March dip in Germany's Ifo index provides further evidence that the Ukraine crisis is spilling over with negative effect to hurt business confidence. Germany's recovery could be put at risk the more the crisis deepens. Here are more details on inflation. Transport costs made the biggest downward contribution to the inflation rate, driven by falling petrol and other fuel prices. Smaller price rises for household gas and electricity bills than in February last year, as well as for clothes and shoes also eased price pressures, the Office for National Statistics said. The pound rose on the news, hitting a session high of $1.6510. Inflation in Britain has hit a new four-year low in February \u2013 1.7% \u2013 dipping further below the Bank of England's 2% target and easing the squeeze on household incomes. The gap between inflation and average wage growth is now the smallest since April 2010, the Office for National Statistics said. The last time wages grew faster than inflation was in early 2008. The FTSE 100 is now up 1.1%, or 72 points at 6592.40, bouncing back from yesterday's seven-week closing low. Easyjet and Kingfisher are the biggest risers, while Royal Mail is leading the pack of losers. Impressed but not shocked \u2013 ING analyst Carsten Brzeski's verdict on the German Ifo confidence numbers. Judging from the just released Ifo index, German businesses are impressed but not shocked by the possible economic impact from the Crimean crisis. The Ifo index dropped in March to 110.7, from 111.3 in February. While the expectations component weakened as a result of the Crimean crisis, the current assessment component continued its impressive upward trend and reached the highest level since April 2012. The German economy is gaining momentum. The exceptionally mild weather has given an enormous boost to construction activity, with new orders in construction up by more than 10% yoy in January. In addition, the well-known growth drivers like the strong labour market, low inventories and filled order books are also doing their work. Looking ahead, two factors will be highly important for the future path of the German economy: external demand and domestic investment. As regards external demand, risks and uncertainties have clearly increased since the start of the year. The slowdown in some emerging market economies, the Russian-Ukrainian crisis and, above all, concerns about the Chinese economy do not bode well for German exports. As regards domestic investment, this is the growth wild card for the German economy. Weak domestic investment has become one of the unpleasant characteristics of the economic performance of the last ten years. In our view, weak private investment is a result of structural and cyclical factors. While cyclical factors have clearly improved, as eg favourable financing conditions and record high gross operating surpluses of German companies, uncertainty and production facilities which are not yet used to capacity could put a speed limit on investment growth. Capacity utilization rates, for example, are still clearly below past peak levels. All in all, today\u2019s Ifo index sends two messages: the German economy has again entered the fast lane in the first quarter but continuing the ride at maximum speed will not be an easy task. German business confidence has fallen for the first time in five months, not surprising given Germany's exposure to Russia and China. The latest business climate index from the Munich-based think tank Ifo has dropped to 110.7 in March from 111.3 in February. It's a mixed bag, however: The expectations component has also worsened, to 106.4 from 108.3, while the business conditions measure has strenghtened to 115.2 from 114.4. With Britain's economy on the mend and gold prices falling, is the \"age of the pawnbroker\" over? Pawnbrokers Albemarle &amp; Bond have called in administrators, PricewaterhouseCoopers. As we reported yesterday, lenders have pulled the plug on the firm's turnaround plan, leaving investors little hope of getting their money back. The shares are suspended yesterday. My colleague Jennifer Rankin wrote last night: Albemarle &amp; Bond, which also provides short-term loans, has experienced a sweeping reversal of fortunes since it boasted of \"the age of the pawnbroker\" in 2011 and launched pop-up shops specialising in gold dealing. Following two profits warnings last autumn, it parted company with five of its six directors, saw its share price crash and was forced to melt down its gold reserves to raise emergency cash. Over in Ukraine, the country's acting defence minister offered to step down over his handling of Russia's annexation of Crimea, but his resignation was turned down by parliament, a day after Ukraine began pulling out troops from the Black Sea peninsula. The Treasury Committee starts the first hearings on last week's budget this morning. First up, At 10.00am: \u00b7 Paul Mortimer-Lee, Global Head, Market Economics, BNP Paribas \u00b7 Michael Saunders, Head of European Economics, Citi \u00b7 Robert Wood, Chief UK Economist, Berenberg Bank At 10.45am (approx): \u00b7 Paul Johnson, Director, Institute for Fiscal Studies \u00b7 Gemma Tetlow, Programme Director, Pensions, Savings and Public Finances Institute for Fiscal Studies Tomorrow afternoon at 2.45pm, Robert Chote, who chairs the Office for Budget Responsibility, will be quizzed about the budget by MPs. The chancellor himself will appear before the committee next Thursday 3 April. As well as the latest UK inflation figures and factory-gate prices for February, we are also getting bank lending data for February from the British Bankers' Association at 9.30am GMT, which are likely to show a further increase in new loans for house purchases to the highest level since the autumn of 2007; and the CBI\u2019s retail sales survey at 11am GMT, the first snapshot of highstreet activity in March. The Daiwa economics team have looked at the eurozone: After yesterday\u2019s flash PMIs saw the average composite PMI rise more than 1pt in Q114 to the highest since Q211, today brings further business sentiment data which are likely to signal continued economic recovery at the start of 2014. In particular, the German Ifo indices are expected to remain elevated in March, with the current assessment index expected to step up further from February\u2019s near two-year high. And broadly consistent with yesterday\u2019s flash PMIs, the latest French INSEE indices just released suggested that the business climate improved, albeit only slightly, in March, with the headline indicator up 1pt to 95, the highest since November but still 5pts below the long-run average. According to the detail, conditions in the industrial sector remained favourable at the long-run average, with slight improvements recorded in the retail, wholesale, other services and construction sectors. And the survey\u2019s \u2018turning point\u2019 indicator also signalled expansion. Markets have opened higher as expected: The Footsie is up 0.88%, Germany's Dax and France's Cac are over 0.5% ahead, Spain's Ibex has gained 0.7% and Italy's FTSE MIB has climbed 0.8%. Here's a round-up of this morning's corporate news. Newly-privatised Royal Mail announced that it was cutting a net 1,300 managerial and head office jobs in an attempt to save \u00a350m a year. The job losses won't affect postmen or women. Royal Mail, which has already shed 50,000 jobs in the last 11 years, has started talks with the Communication Workers Union and Unite about the planned latest cuts. It wants to cut 1,600 jobs but will create 300 new roles at the same time. Royal Mail was sold off last October \u2013 Britain's biggest privatisation for decades. Royal Mail shares are the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning. Embattled insurance group RSA has unveiled a heavily-discounted \u00a3773m rights issue, offering three for eight shares at 56p a share \u2013 that's a 40% discount on Monday's closing price. Last month the new RSA chief executive, former RBS boss Stephen Hester, launched a drive to raise up to \u00a31.6bn in capital. B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher delighted investors with the news that it will return \u00a3200m to shareholders this year. Annual profits met City expectations, rising 4% to \u00a3744m, with sales up 3.5%. Kingfisher, which also runs Screwfix, as well as Castorama and Brico Depot in France, is looking for a strategic partner for its lossmaking B&amp;Q China business, aiming to replicate the partner approach it adopted in Turkey. Kingfisher shares were among the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 in early trading. Easyjet shares also rose after the budget airline upgraded its first-half outlook by 25%. It now expects a pretax loss of \u00a355m to \u00a365m, rather than the previously indicated \u00a370m to \u00a390m. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. European shares are expected to bounce back after yesterday's heavy losses. Spreadbetters are expecting Germany's Dax to open 0.4% higher while Britain's FTSE 100 index and France's CAC are set to rise 0.3%. Concerns over Ukraine and weaker-than-expected US manufacturing numbers weighed on markets yesterday, while some of the selling was also due to investors unwinding positions ahead of the end of the quarter. Today investors will be watching the German business confidence report from the Ifo institute, out at 9am GMT, along with UK inflation numbers, out at 9.30am GMT. Germany's ZEW survey showed worsening sentiment last week and Ifo could be similar, given Germany's exposure to the slowing Chinese economy and Russia. Manufacturing and services PMI surveys out yesterday also suggested growth could be plateauing in Germany. In the UK the squeeze on consumer incomes looks set to ease, with inflation expected to have fallen to 1.7% in February from 1.9% the month before. This would be the lowest inflation rate since November 2009, when it was 1.5%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: Expectations about some form of imminent monetary stimulus from China have been rising, and this appears to be helping boost sentiment, but these are likely to be misplaced given the Chinese authorities determination to make their banks more circumspect in their lending practices. In the last few days the overall direction for European markets has been somewhat difficult to predict with Europe\u2019s core indices well off their 2014 highs, even though Italian markets posted multi year highs last week. Investor sentiment is being pulled all over the place as markets wrestle with a prospective improvement in European economic data against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty in Ukraine, Russia and Turkey, as well as fears of a slowdown in China, at the same time as the US Federal Reserve continues to dial back its stimulus dial. Yesterday\u2019s manufacturing PMI data while not terrible was still below market expectations for both Germany and the US and when set against the prospect of a reduction in stimulus left investors few reasons to indulge in fresh buying of stocks.",

The existence of the payouts was leaked to the Observer earlier this month and sparked the resignation of the chief executive, Euan Sutherland, who was in line for \u00a33m of these retention deals over two years. Sutherland, who took the top job only 10 months ago, branded the group as \"ungovernable\" when he suddenly walked out, exposing the tensions at the top of the loss-making supermarkets and funeral homes group. His temporary stand-in, Richard Pennycook, and at least six others of the remaining team assembled by Sutherland are also receiving the payments, which were put in place last July at the height of the problems in the Co-op bank. The bank warned on Monday that it needed another \u00a3400m capital injection on top of last year's \u00a31.5bn rescue package. The call for the retention deals to be repaid was made by Peter Hunt, who runs the pro-mutual thinktank Mutuo. \"There is no place in a consumer owned co-operative business for unearned executive bonuses. How these came to be requested by management and then approved by the board must be explained. Equally, no member of the current executive will carry the confidence of the membership if they do not immediately and publicly declare that they will not accept such payments,\" he said. Hunt also called for the executives to put an end to the Have Your Say national survey, in which the views of the public were canvassed about the purpose of the Co-op and whether it should continue political donations to the Co-operative party, which has 32 MPs in Westminster. Hunt, in a comment piece for the Guardian, also called for a more conciliatory approach from Lord Myners, the former City minister appointed as a senior non-executive director of the group with a mandate to produce a blueprint for reform. A former general secretary of the Co-op party, Hunt said a panel should be created to work with Myners, who has admitted facing opposition to his plans to create a plc-style board to replace the current one dominated by members of the co-operative movement, and set up a national membership council. \"Eminent as Lord Myners may be, it is not credible to base the future governance on the views of one man,\" Hunt said. Myners used a webcast earlier this month to accuse members of the group of using bullying tactics against him. Myners, the chairman of Guardian Media Group until he joined the Labour government during the 2008 banking crisis, is meeting with 100 or so members of the Co-op regional boards in the coming days. These seven regional boards are influential as they hold more than three-quarters of the votes at annual general meetings and the special meeting that is expected to be convened in the summer to vote on Myners' proposals for reform. The bank's full-year results were scheduled for release on Wednesday but Sutherland's sudden departure forced their publication to be delayed to 17 April. Hunt, whose Mutuo organisation does not receive direct funding from the Co-op but asks for sponsorship for projects, said: \"The swift move to dramatically reduce funding for co-operative organisations will dismay long-standing co-operators further now that the hypocrisy of the executive pay policy has been laid bare.\" It is thought that Pennycook \u2013 who is getting a \u00a3900,000 salary and \u00a3900,000 of retention payments on top \u2013 and others are already considering whether to accept the payments.

But he pointed to a strong forecast net asset value and a good dividend yield as potential supports for the share price. And one other support should be the Qatar stake. Black said:</p> <blockquote> Now, we know that the last bastion of a failed bull case is bid talk and speculation, noting as we do that we are neutral with our recommendation on the stock; we are talking about downside protection though. Furthermore, we do not know what the QIA is thinking whilst it is clear that Sainsbury's has not had an approach; a statement would have been made to the market otherwise. With all of these caveat's stated, why could the QIA be interested: <br> The QIA has a 26% stake in Sainsbury's. In tandem with the family, which we estimate to have a near 14% position, around 40% of the group's equity is controlled by what we consider to be two long-term investors; we do not see the family as a likely seller of Sainsbury stock. Therefore, if the QIA were to take a more strategic view of its UK retail investment, it would have to acquire around 0%% of the share base costing \u00a33.69bn at the current Sainsbury share price.  Sainsbury's has it virtues as a medium-term investment proposition with a joint No.2 market position in the UK food retail segment, alongside Asda, including a similar position in the online grocery channel. Whilst the UK supermarket sector is out of favour with investors, so the sector de-rating, this is a strong and valuable market position in a major European country.  The Sainsbury retail estate has robust asset backing, providing a solid back drop for medium-term financing for any new venture, not that the QIA is deemed to be short of cash in our view. The group also has a robust market position in the UK apparel segment and full control of a limited range financial services company in Sainsbury's Bank, which is being integrated.  With a rising UK population and a return to economic growth, particularly in the south and east of England, we see Sainsbury's as a potentially well placed cash generative group in the medium-term (3-5 years), despite current challenges in the form of potential industry gross margin pressure and channel change.  Indeed, we advocate that Sainsbury should, under its present ownership constitution, materially cut its capital expenditure, which with stabilising trading conditions in due course and the prospect of rising sales densities as industry capacity is exceeded by demand, could lead to satisfactory medium term cash returns on an acquisition of the stock; any acquired vehicle would save the annual \u00a3320m or so paid to shareholders in dividends (including the QIA and the family).  It is arguable that Sainsbury under the control of the QIA and family would benefit from private status at this time, allowing management to be both more strategic and flexible against the currently challenging market backdrop. Additionally, with Justin King retiring from Sainsbury's in July 2014, this could coincidentally be an opportune time for broader ownership change, with Mike Coupe representing strategic and operational continuity.  If the QIA bid a 20% premium to Sainsbury's current share price of 310p (i.e. 372p) then it would have to pay around \u00a34.31bn (\u00a37.18bn market capitalisation) for the outstanding 60%% equity assuming the family retain their stake. In addition, the new investors would assume \u00a32.56bn of Sainsbury debt, which we believe the potentially acquiring organisation could accommodate (it may be an issue for the family); it may be able to absorb this so eliminating around \u00a3132m of annual net financing costs. </blockquote> <p>So Black concludes:</p> <blockquote> We believe the QIA is a source of share price support..., maybe something more. <br> Now, we repeat the points that we do not know or suspect any such thoughts are underway in Doha or London. Additionally, industry returns could deteriorate more than we presently estimate and so dilute the near-term financial outcome from any such acquisition. However, with the stock trading at or around its March 2014 forecast net asset value per share, we believe that there is more merit now than has been the case for some years for Sainsbury's largest investor to dust off 'the file' and consider a much more strategic investment, not least of which is an attractive annual cash return of an asset backed retailer.  The potential prospect of such 'dusting' should also be a source of support for Sainsbury's current share price, to our minds. As such, in the midst of weak sector sentiment and genuine concern on gross margins, we see the QIA with income and net asset support as downside protection for Sainsbury's shares. </blockquote> <p>Not much support at the moment however, as Sainsbury's shares are down 2.8p at 307.6p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "King Digital Entertainment, the British and Swedish games studio behind smartphone hit Candy Crush, will be valued at $7bn when it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, as investors show a renewed appetite for technology firms. Shares in the company behind the wildly popular smartphone game Candy Crush will fluctuate wildly when they begin trading, but it is clear that King's biggest shareholders will suddenly be very rich. Based on the expected flotation price of up to $22.50 (\u00a313.60) a share, here is what the shareholders are worth: Melvyn Morris, chairman, estimated shareholding value $821m 36,467,500 shares A self-made millionaire, Morris has chaired King since 2003. He left school at 16 and by 20 was earning a living as a management consultant. He worked in the US before returning to his home town of Derby, where he started a handful of businesses including a hardwood flooring company, a Spanish property group and a dating agency. When uDate was sold in 2002, it was the second-largest dating site in the world. Morris netted \u00a320m and spent part of the money buying a stake in his beloved Derby County football club and part of it establishing King. Riccardo Zacconi, chief executive, $698m 31,042,045 shares King's urbane Italian chief executive was born in Rome, where he studied economics, and started his career at Boston Consulting. He was lured into digital business during the dotcom boom, and ran the German unit of a Swedish web portal called Spray, which failed to make it to the stockmarket before the bubble burst. Zacconi moved to the UK in 2001 to look for digital investments, and by 2002 had been persuaded to join uDate. The company was sold soon after for $150m and merged with Match.com. he eventually launched King with colleagues from Spray, and persuaded some of uDate's backers, including Melvyn Morris and Toby Rowland, to join the new venture. Spray missed its window to make it rich after delaying its IPO by a month and was sold to Lycos instead. Zacconi's timing looks better with King. Sebastian Knutsson (above), chief creative officer, $396m 17,596,075 shares One of King's founders, Knutsson recently claimed to have designed 10 of the company's 15 worst games \u2013 it has made 180 so far \u2013 but Candy Crush also emerged from his Stockholm studio. A keen gamer himself, his vivid designs are inspired by the multicoloured, flashing and bleeping arcade games of the last century, from Pac-Man to Space Invaders and Tetris. He also has a business brain, thanks to a BA in cost-analysis and finance from the Stockholm School of Economics, and comes from a family of entrepreneurs. His parents ran a denim brand and retail chain, and his sister has her own clothing company. Knutsson co-founded Spray, where he met Zacconi. Lars Markgren, Sweden general manager, $203m 9,043,930 shares Stockholm-based Markgren worked at Spray, along with many of King's founders, before moving into gaming. He manages the pivotal Swedish operations and balances work with a passion for pike-fishing. Stephane Kurgan, Belgian chief operating officer, $168m 7,450,748 shares King's Belgian chief operating officer holds an MBA from France's prestigious Insead, and came to King from the data-centre management business Tideway. Patrik Stymne, chief systems architect, $158m 7,040,000 shares Stymne is not on the board, but he is named as a co-founder. One of the technical brains behind King, he designed the company's IT system having previously worked alongside Knutsson at Lycos, the digital advertising agency Razorfish and Spray. Thomas Hartwig (above), chief technology officer, $143m 6,350,000 shares Another co-founder, Hartwig is the brains behind King's data strategy, harvesting information from the 1.4bn game plays a day to hone each product from its testing phase on the King.com website through to its launch as a standalone smartphone app. He places data scientists in each of the small, typically 10-strong teams developing new King games, collating user experience to decide, for example, how difficult to make each successive level. Like his co-founders, Hartwig cut his teeth at Spray. Gerhard Florin, non-executive director, $25m 1,125,000 shares Having joined the board during the hard times in 2010, Florin has stuck around long enough to reap the benefits. Now a full-time non-executive director, he spent 14 years in senior roles at Electronic Arts, the world's third-largest gaming company and maker of the Fifa football games and the sci-fi shooter Titanfall. Apax Partners, investor, $3.25bn 144,330,001 shares King was one of the last venture capital investments Apax made before focusing on taking more mature companies private. It is also the British buyout firm's most successful bet to date. Apax, whose holdings include the fashion chain New Look, the Orange mobile network in Switzerland and a trade publishing joint venture with the Guardian's parent company, injected about $36m in 2005, and its 48% stake is now worth almost 100 times that. Index Ventures, investor, $562m 24,992,502 shares Index is a legend in technology venture capital, having backed Facebook and Skype, as well as British successes such as the clothing retailer Asos and the Moshi Monsters maker Mind Candy. Index invested alongside Apax in 2005, putting in an estimated $7m. Toby Rowland, founder, $0 No shares Toby Rowland co-founded King with Morris and Zacconi and was co-chief executive until 2008, but he sold his shares in 2011, just months before the company launched its first hit Facebook game. He is married to the author and Vogue journalist Plum Sykes, and his father was the mining tycoon Tiny Rowland, who once owned the Observer and House of Fraser department stores.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Inflation at lowest level in four years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A dip in petrol prices helped inflation fall to its slowest level in more than four years last month, bringing welcome relief to households and bolstering expectations that interest rates will stay at their record low for many months to come. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate was 1.7% in February, down from 1.9% in January and the lowest since October 2009. That was in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. The retail price index (RPI) rate, used to set many pay deals, was 2.7% in February, slightly higher than the 2.6% forecast, but still down from 2.8% in January. The slowdown to well below the government target of 2.0% will give the Bank of England more breathing space to assess the strength of the UK's recovery and judge when interest rates should rise from their record low of 0.5% \u2013 a move policymakers have suggested it will not make until well into next year at the earliest. \"Clearly below-target inflation facilitates the Bank of England keeping interest rates down at 0.5%, where we believe they are highly likely to stay through 2014 and during the early months of 2015, despite the economy's improved growth and markedly reduced unemployment,\" said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. The slowdown will also ease pressure on householders who have grappled for years with falling real wages as pay rises have failed to keep up with increasing prices. There have been signs that pay growth is starting to pick up with average earnings up 1.4% in the three months to January, according to official data released last week. That was the fastest growth since April to June last year and narrowed the gap with inflation. With much of the debate ahead of next May's general election centred on the cost of living, the Treasury welcomed the latest inflation news. \"Inflation has fallen to its lowest level in over four years helping households across the country. The government's long-term economic plan is working, boosting economic security for hardworking people,\" a spokesman said, reprising the catchphrases of George Osborne's budget last week. Labour focused on deteriorating household finances over recent years. \"This fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but the squeeze continues as prices are still rising faster than wages. Working people facing this cost-of-living crisis are on average \u00a31,600 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office,\" said Catherine McKinnell MP, the shadow Treasury minister. The ONS said the main downward pressure on the CPI in February came from motor fuels, with petrol prices down by 0.8p a litre between January and February this year, compared with a rise of 4p a year ago. Diesel prices also fell this year and rose a year earlier. There was also some help from gas and electricity bills and clothing prices, which rose by less than in 2013. The core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, rose to 1.7% in February from 1.6% in January. Separate data on producer prices, also known as factory gate prices, showed a rise of just 0.5% on the year, also the slowest pace of inflation since October 2009 and softer than forecasts for 0.7%. Their input prices, or costs, were down 5.7% on the year, more than the 5.3% forecast and again the weakest price pressure for more than four years. Chris Williamson, an economist at the data specialists Markit, said the key factor determining how long the Bank can leave interest rates at their record low would be pay growth. \"The potential for wages to start rising strongly should not be underestimated, given the speed with which the labour market is improving,\" he said. Economists are divided over whether inflation will push back up above its target this year and over when the Bank will tighten borrowing costs after five years of ultra-loose monetary policy. Christian Schulz, senior economist at the German bank Berenberg, noted the rise in core inflation and potential pressure from housing-related products like furniture as the property market heats up. The ONS said on Tuesday that house price inflation was 6.8% in January, led by London, where prices rose 13.2% on the year. Schulz also said slack in the economy was being eroded fast. \"Unemployment is falling, vacancies are rising and firms report high and rising recruitment difficulties. That should push inflation back up to, and possible a touch above, the 2% inflation target by the end of 2015,\" he said. \"The lack of headline inflationary pressures gives the BoE a bit of room to delay a first hike until next year. We expect the first 25 basis point rate hike in the first quarter of next year followed by three more 25bp increases during 2015.\"",

      "body": "<p>A dip in petrol prices helped inflation fall to its slowest level in more than four years last month, bringing welcome relief to households and bolstering expectations that interest rates will stay at their record low for many months to come.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/february-2014/stb---consumer-price-indices---january-2014.html\" title=\"\">consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate was 1.7%</a> in February, down from 1.9% in January and the lowest since October 2009. That was in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.</p> <p>The retail price index (RPI) rate, used to set many pay deals, was 2.7% in February, slightly higher than the 2.6% forecast, but still down from 2.8% in January.</p> <p>The slowdown to well below the government target of 2.0% will give the Bank of England more breathing space to assess the strength of the UK's recovery and judge when interest rates should rise from their record low of 0.5% \u2013 a move <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/25/bank-england-raise-interest-rates-2015-mpc-mccafferty\" title=\"\">policymakers have suggested it will not make until well into next year</a> at the earliest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-433027282\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395772898485/UKinflation.png\" alt=\"UK inflation\" width=\"460\" height=\"381\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\"Clearly below-target inflation facilitates the Bank of England keeping interest rates down at 0.5%, where we believe they are highly likely to stay through 2014 and during the early months of 2015, despite the economy's improved growth and markedly reduced unemployment,\" said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight.</p> <p>The slowdown will also ease pressure on householders who have grappled for years with falling real wages as pay rises have failed to keep up with increasing prices.</p> <p>There have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/19/uk-earnings-rise-budget-2014-boost-unemployment\" title=\"\">signs that pay growth is starting to pick up</a> with average earnings up 1.4% in the three months to January, according to official data released last week. That was the fastest growth since April to June last year and narrowed the gap with inflation.</p> <p>With much of the debate ahead of next May's general election centred on the cost of living, the Treasury welcomed the latest inflation news. \"Inflation has fallen to its lowest level in over four years helping households across the country. The government's long-term economic plan is working, boosting economic security for hardworking people,\" a spokesman said, reprising the catchphrases of George Osborne's budget last week.</p> <p>Labour focused on deteriorating household finances over recent years. \"This fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but the squeeze continues as prices are still rising faster than wages. Working people facing this cost-of-living crisis are on average \u00a31,600 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office,\" said Catherine McKinnell MP, the shadow Treasury minister.</p> <p>The ONS said the main downward pressure on the CPI in February came from motor fuels, with petrol prices down by 0.8p a litre between January and February this year, compared with a rise of 4p a year ago. Diesel prices also fell this year and rose a year earlier. There was also some help from gas and electricity bills and clothing prices, which rose by less than in 2013.</p> <p>The core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, rose to 1.7% in February from 1.6% in January. Separate data on producer prices, also known as factory gate prices, showed a rise of just 0.5% on the year, also the slowest pace of inflation since October 2009 and softer than forecasts for 0.7%. Their input prices, or costs, were down 5.7% on the year, more than the 5.3% forecast and again the weakest price pressure for more than four years.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, an economist at the data specialists Markit, said the key factor determining how long the Bank can leave interest rates at their record low would be pay growth. \"The potential for wages to start rising strongly should not be underestimated, given the speed with which the labour market is improving,\" he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-433027283\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/25/1395772898627/UKHouseprices.png\" alt=\"UK House prices\" width=\"460\" height=\"381\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Economists are divided over whether inflation will push back up above its target this year and over when the Bank will tighten borrowing costs after five years of ultra-loose monetary policy.</p> <p>Christian Schulz, senior economist at the German bank Berenberg, noted the rise in core inflation and potential pressure from housing-related products like furniture as the property market heats up. The ONS said on Tuesday that <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/house-price-index/january-2014/index.html\" title=\"\">house price inflation was 6.8% in January</a>, led by London, where prices rose 13.2% on the year. Schulz also said slack in the economy was being eroded fast.</p> <p>\"Unemployment is falling, vacancies are rising and firms report high and rising recruitment difficulties. That should push inflation back up to, and possible a touch above, the 2% inflation target by the end of 2015,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The lack of headline inflationary pressures gives the BoE a bit of room to delay a first hike until next year. We expect the first 25 basis point rate hike in the first quarter of next year followed by three more 25bp increases during 2015.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Postal unions have reacted angrily and raised the prospect of industrial action after Royal Mail announced plans to cut 1,600 jobs in the postal group's first big round of redundancies since it was privatised in October. The company said the cuts would affect managers, mainly from backroom operations and head office, with no impact on staff who sort and deliver mail. About 300 new or expanded jobs will be created, taking the net number of leavers to 1,300 out of a workforce of 150,000. The Unite union condemned the treatment of employees, who it said deserved better. The union, which represents 7,000 Royal Mail managers, said if management made forced redundancies it would consider balloting for strikes. Brian Scott, Unite's officer for Royal Mail, said: \"First the government sells off Royal Mail on the cheap and now the newly privatised service is ruthlessly sacrificing jobs. \"We do not believe that it's a coincidence that this announcement has been made just before the company prepares to announce its first full set of accounts since privatisation. It's more proof that Royal Mail's primary reason for existing is now about making profits rather than serving the nation.\" Royal Mail shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 index, dropping 1.5% to 575p. The formerly state-owned postal service floated on the stock market in October in what critics said was an underpriced sale that benefited City investors. The company said at the time that it would have to become more efficient to compete with private operators. The company announced its first job cuts since privatisation days before its financial year-end on 30 March. Royal Mail posts its first set of annual results to the City in May. Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said the cuts were drastic and deeply concerning. The CWU mainly represents frontline postal workers but it said it would fight to protect jobs. The union's top Royal Mail representatives will discuss the cuts at a scheduled meeting on Tuesday and may make a further announcement then. The company hammered out a landmark deal with the CWU late last year that enshrined workers' rights and appeared to usher in an era of post-privatisation industrial peace. Royal Mail said it would consult with both unions about the cuts. Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, said: \"We are continuously improving our efficiency, whilst maintaining our high quality of service. We need to do so in order to effectively compete in the letters and parcels markets. This is the best way to ensure the continued delivery of the universal service and the good quality jobs we provide for our people.\" The company said the job cuts would cost it about \u00a3100m and that total \"transformation costs\" for the financial year ending 30 March would be \u00a3230m \u2013 \u00a370m higher than it had predicted. About \u00a325m of the cost savings will take effect next year, partly making up for a likely increase of between \u00a370m and \u00a380m in the cost of pensions. Royal Mail said the job cuts were not a response to the rising pension costs. Royal Mail said about 50,000 employees had left since 2003 and that it had a good record of cutting jobs by not replacing leavers, finding people new jobs and voluntary redundancy.",
