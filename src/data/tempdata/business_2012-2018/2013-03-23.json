      "bodyText": "Cyprus has taken a significant step towards securing its desperately needed bailout. The bills approved in the last couple of hours will allow Nicosia to implement a much-deed restructure its banking sector, impose capital controls to prevent a run at its banks, and set up a solidarity fund that might attract new capital. But it's only part of the battle. Cyprus still needs to meet the demands of international lenders, in time for the eurogroup meeting on Sunday. It is going to be a tense, dramatic weekend for Cyprus. On Saturday, MPs are expected to reconvene at parliament to discuss and vote on the deposit levy -- back on the agenda, as other options run out. The details of that tax will be fascinating, amid rumours that big depositors will lose 15% of their wealth. Cyprus's president Nicos Anastasiades will then travel to Brussels to start the task of persuading eurozone officials to unlock its bailout before the European Central Bank can pull the liquidity plug on Monday. Sunday's meeting of the eurogroup, complete with Christine Lagarde, will be a crucial event -- determining Cyprus's fate, and the long-term future of the eurozone. Thanks for reading, and commenting. Keep watching the website over the weekend for the latest developments. Goodnight! Just to clarify, in case of confusion, the Cypriot parliament did not vote on the issue of a deposits tax. That will be considered on Saturday -- just checked, and we don't have any idea on timings yet. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, is also expected to attend Sunday's Eurogroup meeting to discuss Cyprus. OK, the parliamentary session in Cyprus is over for the night. Here's Reuters' early take on the passing of the bank resolution bill in the last few minutes: Cyprus adopted legislation on Friday allowing the government to split the island's failing lenders into good and bad banks as it races to clinch a bailout from the European Union and avert a financial meltdown. Officials say the law is likely to be applied first to Cyprus's second largest lender, Cyprus Popular Bank [Laiki], to restructure it without hurting small depositors. The Cypriot parliament has approved the legislation to restructure its banking sector. That paves the way for Laiki, the nation's stricken second-largest lender, to be split into a good bank and a bad bank. Here's a live stream of the debate in Nicosia (sorry for the delay, better late than never) This website, 24h.com.cy, is blogging highlights of the debate, in Greek. It reports that Green party MP George Perdikis said he would abstain in the votes tonight (not clear if he meant all of them) due to 'loopholes' Perdikis went on to call for the resignation of the governor of the central bank, and the minister of finance. MPs are now getting their teeth into the remaining laws (seven of them, we believe) which are all based around the restructuring the country's banking sector. To re-iterate, the decision to approve the capital controls bill means Cypriots are likely to soon face tough restrictions on how much money they can take out of their bank, on access to their own savings, and on their ability to transfer funds. This is the full list of powers that could be imposed ( translated by @YiannisMouzakis this morning) Restrictions in daily withdrawals Ban on premature termination of time savings deposits Compulsory renewal of all time savings deposits upon maturity Conversion of current accounts to time deposits Ban or restrictions on non cash transactions Restrictions on use of debit, credit or prepaid debit cards Ban or restriction on cashing in checks Restrictions on domestic interbank transfers or transfers within the same bank Restrictions on the interactions/transactions of the public with credit institutions Restrictions on movements of capital, payments, transfers Any other measure which the Finance Minister or the Governor of Cyprus Central Bank see necessary for reasons of public order and safety MPs are racing through the legislation. They have voted to adopt a law creating a solidarity fund to pool state assets. And they have adopted the law that gives the government power to enforce capital controls. More than 12 hours late, the Cypriot parliament has convened for its emergency session. On the agenda.... implementing capital controls, creating a solidarity fund, and restructuring the nation's second-largest bank, Laiki. Another development -- Brussels has postponed next week's EU summit with Japan, so that Herman Van Rompuy and Jose Manuel Barroso can be in Brussels to assist on Cyprus. In a statement, they said: The on-going efforts to find a solution for the financial situation of Cyprus require our presence in Brussels. We reiterate the importance of EU-Japan strategic relations and would like to thank Prime Minister Abe for expressing his understanding. News is breaking that eurozone finance ministers have agreed to hold a meeting in person, in Brussels, on Sunday. Britain has dispatched a task force of top civil servants to Cyprus to advise the stricken island on how to pull its banking system back from the brink of collapse. The group of officials is led by Treasury mandarin Tom Scholar, one of Britain's most experienced mandarins who played a key role in the UK's own bank rescue. My colleague Jill Treanor has the story: The highly regarded Scholar is the Treasury's second permanent secretary and an expert in public finance and international issues. At the time of the UK financial meltdown he was parachuted into Northern Rock after it was nationalised. He was also a player in the 2008 bailouts of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. He is understood to have assembled a team of experts in banking and crisis management from across government departments to help solve the problems facing the two biggest banks, Bank of Cyprus and Laiki. Here's the full story: Cyprus crisis: UK experts fly out to advise on bailout Developments! Cyprus state TV reckons that the Cypriot parliament is going to vote on nine bills tonight. That legislation is thought to include the restructuring of the Cypriot banking sector, and the imposition of those wide-ranging restrictions on capital movement (see the full list of capital controls here) However, the law to enforce a tax on savings will be delayed until Saturday. And if it's approved, the Cypriot leadership is planning to head to Brussels - presumably to make their case that their \u20ac10bn bailout should be approved. Efthimia Efthimiou, the journalists who is monitoring Greek and Cypriot media, confirms: Christopher Pissarides, the Nobel economics laureate who has been advising the Cypriot government today, has just said that he's confident of a compromise tonight, or tomorrow morning. Speaking to Channel 4 News, Pissarides said that the Cyprus* parliament had to accept a 'resolution' to one or two of its banks and agree to a levy on depositors (he wasn't more specific). Only then could it hope for its bailout loan. It looks like they'll be able to reach a compromise tonight, or at best tomorrow morning. It's not going to be a good one, but that's what has to be done. Asked whether Cyprus had brought the crisis on itself by throwing its doors open to dubious Russian, Pissarides replied that Cyprus's losses on Greek bonds had precipitated the crisis. * - not Greek, as I initially wrote. Sorry guys - thanks, dear reader who pointed it out.... It's now an hour since we had expected the debate in the Cyprus parliament to start, but no joy yet. Clearly the government has not yet reached an agreement that satisfies its own parliament and the eurozone/IMF/ECB officials. The latest reports are that MPs might vote on just three bills tonight, including the restructuring of Laiki, but that legislation on a savings levy would be delayed until Saturday: Amid the swirling rumours tonight, there is further evidence that deposit holders with more than \u20ac100,000 in the bank are in the firing line, for a bigger hit than originally planned. A \"party source\" told Reuters that those wealthy savers could be taxed more than 10%, as Nicosia tries desperately to make the sums add up. Here's the reason: We're trying to safeguard the provident (pension) funds in Cyprus Popular Bank, which are valued at over \u20ac600m. Manos Giakoumis, head of equity research at Euroxx Securities, is monitoring RIK television, and flags up that two parties - DHSY and DHKO - have apparently proposed a 15% haircut: Demonstrators outside the Cyprus parliament have daubed \"No\" across a Flag of Europe this evening, and then burned it* (according to two people at the scene). * - or a second flag (you can see from the second photo that there were too). After a dramatic week our economics editor, Larry Elliott, has written about the five lessons we can learn from the Cyprus crisis. Here's one of them: The eurozone is kidding itself if it thinks it has completely corralled the crisis. Bank depositors in other member states will not forget that the eurozone was willing at one part to target depositors big and small. They will also have picked up that when Cyprus pushed back against the original plan, the eurozone blinked. Five lessons from a week of confusion in Cyprus Update: Johanes points out in the readers comments below (here) that there is a 6th lesson: the human impact of this awful week: Not one of these \"lessons\" has anything to do with the loss of dignity or coming poverty of a block of European citizens. The markets and the troika \"got away with it\" it seems. This time. It would be remiss of me not to mention that Fitch, the rating agency, has just put the UK on Rating Watch Negative - meaning the AAA rating is more likely to be cut. Fitch made the move after analysing the economic growth and debt forecasts in Wednesday's budget. It will decide by the end of April whether to downgrade. The statement is here. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports from Brussels: European Commission officials say that the legislation on restructuring Cyprus Popular Bank and imposing capital controls had to be endorsed by the troika and then implemented virtually immediately to have a chance of meeting Monday\u2019s deadline. Officials said that eurozone finance ministers could stage another emergency session on Sunday either in Brussels or by teleconference. Official confirmation that Cyprus is considering resurrecting the plan to tax some bank deposits (as has been rumoured for some hours), from finance minister Michalis Sarris. Back from Moscow Sarris was asked by reporters if a bank levy was being considered. He replied: I think that is clearly on the table, that is something that needs to be discussed to see whether a levy on deposits of some sort ... would make a contribution to finalising the package. Interestingly, Sarris then suggested that Cyprus's contribution to the bailout may have changed: We are now talking about different numbers and we have to look at what are the possible sources. The disruption in Cyprus this week, and the closure of its banks, has already harmed its economy -- and the capital controls now being considered are likely to depress output further. Just in: the political leaders of Cyprus are expected to meet in around half an hour's time (7pm local time, or 5pm GMT) to consider the proposal which has been ground out today. The plan, according to the RIK TV station, is for the debate to start at 8pm local time (ie, 6pm GMT), followed by a vote tonight. For guidance, the first debate on Tuesday night lasted two hours. It's now been confirmed that Greece's Piraeus is buying the Greek-based units of Bank of Cyprus and Laiki Bank, following the agreement announced this morning (see 11.32am) Shares in Piraeus have leapt by 20% today, suggesting it got rather the end of the deal. Tempting fate? German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has declared that the calm reaction to the Cyprus crisis in the financial markets shows that traders have confidence in the eurozone. Sch\u00e4uble told the Bild tabloid that: The crisis over Cyprus has so far had no measurable impact on the interest rates of, for example, Spain or Portugal. The financial markets clearly recognise that the euro zone is essentially better prepared for possible turbulence. Just checked the bond yields, and Sch\u00e4uble's right - Spanish 10-year bonds are trading at an interest rate of 4.87%. But the counter-argument is that the system is only holding together because of the various 'unorthodox' measures deployed by central bankers, and faith that they would do even more if needed. As this new research note from Capital Economics explains; Potential triggers for a rebound in volatility therefore include a renewed flare-up of the crisis in the euro-zone (perhaps now only starting in Cyprus), the withdrawal of exceptional monetary stimulus and a variable pace of monetary and fiscal tightening in different countries. Employees of Laiki Bank, or Cyprus Popular Bank, continue to hold their rally outside parliament in Nicosia: And this was the scene a little earlier: So, MPs in Nicosia continue to try to reach a deal - and the weather now matches the mood of the nation: Hold that optimism, folks. News agency NMI is reporting that the European Central Bank has vetoed one of the ideas put forward by the Cyprus government today. It appears that Cypriot MP's had asked to be allowed to change some of the legislation heading through the parliament, but this was rejected by the ECB. If nothing else, it suggests the negotiations are continuing -- seven hours after a debate on the plan was due to begin. OK, here's the details of the upbeat comments from the Cypriot government about a deal within \"the next few hours.\" Averof Neophytou, deputy leader of Cyprus' ruling Democratic Rally party, has said the government can reach an \"agreed platform\" so parliament can approve these specific measures that are consistent with the targets and framework of the last Eurogroup meeting (when the original bailout was agreed). If so, that would unlock the \u20ac10bn promised to Cyprus by the eurozone and the IMF, and the risk of it crashing out of the eurozone would recede. Breaking: Cyprus ruling party has said a bailout deal acceptable to the European Union may be only hours away. Crucially, it is talking about a deal 'within the EU framework'. Looking for more details.... The news has sent the euro rallying over the $1.30 level, as traders bet that the crisis could yet end well...... Time for a catch-up of the main developments in Cyprus so far today: \u2022 Cyprus has warned that its future would be decided on Friday as frantic negotiations with international lenders continued. Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said the Cyprus parliament had just a few hours to take tough decisions to save its economy and banking sector, and avoid \u2018social misery\u2019. Stylianides told reporters in Nicosia: In a few hours we will be called upon to take the big decisions and reply to the hard dilemmas. The next few hours will determine the future of this country. We must all assume our responsibility. The full statement is here \u2022 The Cyprus parliament has twice delayed a planned vote on the rescue package hammered out by Cypriot leaders yesterday. The debate was due to start 6 hours ago, but is in limbo as frantic behind-the-scenes talks continue. \u2022 Government insiders have told us the plan could dramatically change again, and include a tax on savers. (see here) It appears, though, that Cyprus would spare those with less than \u20ac100,000 in the bank. \u2022 According to Bloomberg, rich depositors (with over \u20ac100k) at Cyprus's two biggest banks could suffer losses of up to 40%. (See here) \u2022 Russia has declined to offer fresh support to Cyprus, following the finance minister's two-day visit to Moscow. Talks are over, according to the Russian finance minister \u2022 Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, has voiced her opposition to Cyprus nationalising pension funds to fund its \u20ac6bn portion of its bailout. Merkel told her MPs that Cyprus had to realise that its business model was dead (more here) \u2022 Details of Cyprus's plans for capital controls have emerged. They include dramatic restrictions on Cypriots and businesses in the country, including: * unspecified limits on daily cash withdrawals, * a total ban on accessing cash in \u2018timed\u2019 savings accounts, * limits on cashing cheques, and * restrictions on movements of capital, payments, and transfers. The full grim details are here \u2022 And outside the Cyprus parliament, demonstrators continue to protest (photos here) Financial markets are looking calm, with the Dow Jones index gaining 55 points, or 0.4%, in early trading to 14476. The FTSE 100 is up 23 points, also 0.4%, to 6412. The reports from Nicosia today that the government is trying to hammer out a new deal behind the scenes appears to have reassured traders. Market analysts Ransquawk commented: Sentiment has recently lifted in Europe following the news that talks between Cyprus and the Troika are at their final stages. Still some way to go, though. Cyprus's president Nicos Anastasiades has tweeted that it is vital that MPs pass the legislation to restructure its banking sector and bringing capital controls. He said: Parliament will have to take big and difficult decisions. There will be painful aspects but country must be saved As explained this morning (here), the capital controls will mean draconian restrictions for Cyprus. They include limits on daily cash withdrawals, a total ban on accessing cash in 'timed' savings accounts (ie, with a 90-day notification limit). limits on cashing cheques, and restrictions on movements of capital, payments, transfers. Employees of Laiki Bank are still demonstrating outside the Cyprus parliament building. There is still no news of the bank's fate, as the legislation to break it into a good and bad bank has not yet been voted on, as Cyprus continues to negotiate. Bloomberg is reporting that Eurozone finance ministers are pushing Cyprus to hit large depositors at both of its two biggest banks - Bank of Cyprus and Laiki - with losses of up to 40%, in an attempt to get a new bailout deal agreed in time. Under the plan, attributed to four European officials, the two institutions would be smashed together to create a 'good' bank and a 'bad' bank: Insured deposits -- below the European Union ceiling of 100,000 euros ($129,000) -- would go into a so-called good bank and not sustain any losses, while uninsured deposits would go into the bad bank and be frozen until assets could be sold, said the four officials. Losses to unsecured creditors, including uninsured depositors, could reach 40%, which has support from the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. More here. Close watchers of the crisis will know that a similar version of this plan was discussed at the meeting last weekend when the Cyprus bailout was agreed. As this inside story of the negotiations explains, Germany and the IMF wanted a big hit on wealthier savers' deposits, the commission was keen on modest contributions from savers with less than \u20ac100,000 and president Anastasiades didn't want to spook wealthy Russians. A week is a long time in the eurozone crisis So, rather than Plan B, Cyprus appears to be moving towards a rejigged version of the deal fatefully agreed last weekend. Plan A lite, perhaps - Losses for large depositors but protection for smaller ones with less than \u20ac100,000. That matches the deposit guarantee schemes in place across Europe, but whose effectiveness has been questioned by the widely derided decision to hit all savers. Now, if the plan to split Laiki Bank into 'good' and 'bad' units is executed, then Cyprus's contribution to its own bailout falls from \u20ac6bn to perhaps \u20ac3.5bn (because Laiki no longer needs to be recapitalised). Dow Jones Newswires also reckons that savers with less than \u20ac100,000 will be protected if the Cyprus government returns to the original idea of taxing deposits Cyprus insiders have confirmed to the Guardian that the original plan to tax bank deposits is back on the agenda today. But it's likely that small savers with less than \u20ac100,000 in the bank would be spared (but that's not official) The move comes growing criticism of the way Cypriot politicians have handled the crisis. From Nicosia, Helena Smith reports: Insiders are telling me that the tax levy may well be included in legislation MPs will be called to vote on later today. The chief executive of Laiki Bank has also joined the chorus of criticism of the the government's alternative bailout calling the restructuring of Cyprus' second biggest bank \"a disaster.\" \"It will be a disaster not just for the bank but for the economy of Cyprus,\" he said. Dividing the lender between \"good\" and \"bad\" banks would have a knock-on effect for other banks he argued and lead, inexorably, to soaring unemployment, closure of businesses and loss of deposits. \"The bank is a systemic bank and we believe this problem will be transferred to the other banks very quickly. So effectively no bank will be able to operate normally from now on and I don't really know until when.\" That is in line with view of other more cool-headed analysts who have also described the overwhelming repudication of the first bailout package as a classic example of MPs pandering to populist sentiment. Cypriot TV is reporting that those with more than \u20ac100,000 in a Cypriot bank could lose at 15% of their savings. If the would suggest that Cyprus's hope of creating a national solidarity fund has been rejected by the Troika, as rumoured this morning (see here). Greek banks are taking control of the branches and assets of Cypriot banks based in Greece, following a deal hammered out between the two countries, and announced in the last few minutes. This was one element of the original bailout deal agreed last weekend. Financial terms aren't available, but Cyprus insists it got the best deal under the (pretty terrible) circumstances: After talks between Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, it was confirmed that the spinoff issue of Greek branches of Cypriot banks has been settled with the most favourable terms under the present circumstances, with a significant benefit for the Cypriot side. Cyprus's top government spokesman has told reporters that 'the next few hours' will determine the future of the country, as rumour swirls over its latest plans for a bailout (see 10.43am) Christos Stylianides added that MPs will have to take \"difficult decisions\" later today, now that legislation to impose capital controls and split Laiki Bank have been submitted to parliament. Here's the full statement: Statement by the Government Spokesman, Mr Christos Stylianides The President of the Republic and the Government are in hard negotiations with Troika in order to conclude to solutions that will save the banking system, the economy in general and will bring back calmness in the country. During these really critical hours, everyone must demonstrate the highest level of responsibility. The President of the Republic, as he mentioned during his address to the nation, assumed a high political cost and accepted the deal with the Eurogroup for the stability levy, despite his disagreements, bearing in mind the social misery that a possible rejection of the proposal would cause. In a few hours we will be called upon to take the big decisions and reply to the hard dilemmas. The Government has already submitted the bills. The philosophy through which it is trying to find the best possible solution, under the given circumstances, is already known.The House of Representatives will soon be called upon to take the big decisions.Undoubtedly, there will also be painful aspects in any decision taken, but the country must be saved. The political leadership must, despite the different ideological and political approaches,provide the way out. The President of the Republic as the guardian of unity kept the political leadership constantly briefed and respected the decision of the House of Representatives. Through the continuous meetings with the party leaders he aimed at collective wisdom. The next few hours will determine the future of this country. We must all assume our responsibility. [end] People continue to queue up at cash machines of Laiki (Popular) bank this morning - but we're not seeing a big panic (Laiki savers should now have their deposits protected under the plan to split it) The government's plan for a national solidarity fund may have been rejected by the country's international lenders, according to two reports from Cyprus this morning. And that has left some MPs in Cyprus talking about a return to the deposit tax that appeared to have been abandoned a few days ago. Greece's Kathimerini reports: Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades held talks with the troika in Nicosia on Friday morning as it looked like his government might have to abandon plans to create an investment fund to prevent the collapse of its banking system. As reported earlier (see here), Angela Merkel remains opposed to using Cyprus's pension reserves as assets in the Solidarity Fund which was being drawn up. The Financial Times is also reporting that the Troika (the IMF, the ECB and the EU) have told Cyprus that the plan drawn up yesterday isn't acceptable: Lenders rejects latest Cyprus bailout plan \u201cThere was some discussion of going back to the original plan of a bank levy, but there are objections from the central bank,\u201d said one person with knowledge of the talks. We are still chasing more detail on the situation, and it's important to note that other newswires with good people on the ground are not reporting it as fact. Yet anyway. Hopefully we should know more soon \u2013 when government spokesman Christos Stylianides has addressed the media.... My colleague Helena Smith is in Nicosia, and reports that there is still optimism that the legislation will be voted through today: Just spoke to former MP economist Marios Mavrides who was optimistic despite Merkel's criticism of the Cypriot government's latest rescue plan. He said he thought the island's 56-member parliament would easily endorse all nine bills to keep the banking sector afloat. \"Every hour that passes is absolutely critical,\" he said. \"Restructuring of Laiki will raise \u20ac2.7bn and I have no doubt that it will be passed probably later this afternoon,\" he said. We now have details of the 'capital controls' which Cyprus intends to vote into law (sometime) today, thanks to star blogger @YiannisMouzakis: It's a remarkable set of restrictions on the usual nuts and bolts of the financial system - particularly given the final point: Restrictions in daily withdrawals Ban on premature termination of time savings deposits Compulsory renewal of all time savings deposits upon maturity Conversion of current accounts to time deposits Ban or restrictions on non cash transactions Restrictions on use of debit, credit or prepaid debit cards Ban or restriction on cashing in checks Restrictions on domestic interbank transfers or transfers within the same bank Restrictions on the interactions/transactions of the public with credit institutions Restrictions on movements of capital, payments, transfers Any other measure which the Finance Minister or the Governor of Cyprus Central Bank see necessary for reasons of public order and safety The full bill is online here (in Greek) There's talk that the debate and vote in Cyprus has been pushed back again: The crisis in Cyprus has hit business confidence in Germany, which has dropped for the first time in five months (according to Munich's Ifo institute). And if Germany business leaders are worried, it's a fair bet that those in other eurozone countries are too. Not good for the eurozone's hopes of escaping recession soon. More details here on Bloomberg. Another photo from this morning demo in Cyprus: Heads-up: European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso and Russian president Dmitry Medvedev are hold a press conference in Moscow soon. It will be streamed here. Back to Germany, and Angela Merkel has discussed the Cyprus crisis with MPs at a closed door session this morning. Reuters has got the details: German Chancellor Angela Merkel told lawmakers on Friday the nationalisation of pension funds in Cyprus would not be an acceptable way of plugging a hole in its finances to qualify for an international bailout, parliamentary sources said. Merkel was also quoted by two MPs from her centre-right coalition as saying that debt sustainability and the restructuring of its banks must be core elements of any new Cyprus deal, which she called an matter of \"credibility\". Merkel apparently also told MPs that she wanted Cyprus to remain within the euro, but that it \"must realise its business model is dead\". That fuels the suspicion that Germany was determined to end Cyprus's close financial links to Russia. Shares on Europe's financial markets are mainly lower this morning, but the situation remains pretty calm as the Cyprus crisis plays out: FTSE 100: up 3 points at 6391, + 0.04% German DAX: down 47 points at 7884, - 0.6% French CAC: down 24 points at 3750, - 0.6% Spanish IBEX: down 68 points at 8282, - 0 .7% Italian FTSE MIB: down 4 points at 15929. - 0.04% And the euro is flat, at around $1.291 against the US dollar. So why no panic, given the risk of Cyprus's bailout collapsing, followed by its banks next week if the ECB walks away? Well, analysts and traders seem to be clinging to the hope that a deal will be agreed in time. As Chris Weston of IG Index put it: One gets the sense that at the end of the day the Cypriots should see the pain that will come from a disorderly bank failure, and cobble together a weekend deal. Or at least that\u2019s the plan, because if they don\u2019t the ECB will not be there to help them out on the liquidity front. A final weekend agreement is our base-case. Cyprus state TV is reporting that a government spokesman will make a statement on the situation at noon local time, so in around 45 minutes. A protest rally is taking place outside Cyprus's parliament this morning, including many banking sector workers who face losing their jobs through the restructuring of Laiki Bank: The vote in Cyprus has been delayed until this afternoon. There are reports that this is to allow finance minister Michalis Sarris to return to parliament and update MPs on his trip to Russia. Sir Howard Davies, former boss of Britain's Financial Services Authority, just told Radio 4 Today programme that this is a crisis of 'stupidity', and that it was \"too big an ask\" to take a levy from deposit holders (as in the original plan). The IMF and EU are going to have put more funds in unless they want Cyprus to \"slip out\" of the euro, he added. But Germany's Michael Meister, the deputy leader of the CDU party, rejected the criticism - saying Cyprus was being treated fairly, and needed to take the necessary steps to bring its finances into line. If we relax the rules for Cyprus, how will Ireland, Greece, Portugal et al feel, he asks. There are signs this morning of rising frustration in Germany. Volker Kauder, parliamentary leader of Angela Merkel's CDU party, has warned that Cyprus is \"playing with fire\", and needs to find a workable proposal to find its share of the bailout urgently. Kauder also told the ARD TV station that Germany would not support the nationalisation of Cyprus's pension funds (one possible way to find the shortfall in the bailout plan). I don't think this can happen, because this would be huge for pensioners, for the small people. So I don't think this is a proposal that help... If a proposal comes, I am optimistic. But we aren't there yet.....I still believe we will get a settlement, but Cyprus is playing with fire. Russia's finance minister has also confirmed that talks with Cyprus over a possible rescue package have ended without a new deal. Anton Siluanov has told reporters in Moscow that Russia would wait to see whether Cyprus reached a new deal with the Troika (the EU, the IMF and the ECB) first. Siluanov said: The talks have ended as far as the Russian side is concerned Yesterday, Cyprus's finance minister Michalis Sarris had said he hoped to interest Russian investors in taking stakes in Cyprus's banks and energy deposits Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Cyprus crisis, as it struggles to agree a new bailout deal as the clock ticks towards the Monday deadline set by the European Central Bank. MPs in Nicosia are preparing to vote on new legislation to restructure its banking sector this morning. The vote, on nine different bills, will pave the way to restructuring its second largest bank, Laiki, and imposing unprecedented restrictions on financial transactions on the sector. The session, which begins at 8am GMT, is a crucial step for Cyprus (in its push for Plan B), and should cut more than \u20ac2bn off the \u20ac6bn which Cyprus must find. But Cyprus will still need to reach a deal with the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund before the ECB carries out its threat to withdraw liquidity support on Monday. And without that plan, Cyprus's position looks pretty shaky this morning. The vote comes as finance minister Michalis Sarris flies home from Russia, apparently having failed to secure fresh support from Moscow. As Bloomberg reports: \"I think we are not able to get the support that we wanted to get,\u201d Sarris said in an interview after checking out of the Lotte Hotel in downtown Moscow. \u201cBut we must go back home because things are getting serious.\u201d We'll be following all the latest developments through the day.",
