      "bodyText": "One hundred and twenty-five foreign investors have taken up an amnesty offer from the Australian Tax Office to declare their ownership of real estate, according to documents obtained by Guardian Australia from a freedom of information request. The 125 investors have moved ahead of the deadline expiring on 30 November, the documents show. A spokeswoman for the ATO said it had separately identified about 500 potential breaches of foreign investment laws it was investigating, a number of them from disclosures. \u201cAcross our foreign real estate investment investigation program, we have already identified possible breaches and we have about 500 cases on hand, with about 400 of those coming from community disclosures,\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of real estate, we are investigating properties located across all states and territories \u2013 while there are no specific trends, the majority of cases are related to properties in metropolitan areas.\u201d The ATO was unable to provide a more detailed breakdown in order to \u201cmaintain confidentiality of taxpayer information\u201d, but there was evidence to suggest some professions involved in land purchases may be assisting in some breaches. \u201cIn our investigations across Australia we are seeing a range of properties, from apartments, to suburban houses, to waterfront properties worth tens of millions,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of these investigations are indicating the involvement of third parties. We are looking closely at agents, accountants, lawyers and financial advisers who may be facilitating illegal property purchases.\u201d The federal government has flagged a series of changes to foreign investment laws, which aim to improve reporting of foreign investment and increase penalties for breaches. Under foreign investment laws, foreign buyers must seek approval for certain types of real estate purchases in Australia. The ATO will also oversee the implementation of a national register for foreign investments in agricultural, commercial and residential properties. It has also been encouraging foreign investors who have not previously disclosed their property interests under a \u201creduced penalty\u201d scheme that could allow them to avoid criminal penalties and get 12 months to divest their assets. The documents released under freedom of information laws are the disclosures made by foreign investors of residential property across the country but have been heavily redacted. The ATO declined to release details of the identities of those who took up the amnesty offer citing the broad secrecy laws for tax information which it said made the data \u201cprotected information\u201d.I The ATO also disclosed it had not yet produced a database to implement the national register. Guardian Australia also asked for the current version of the databases used for the register of residential and agricultural land, but the ATO said the databases did not exist. In relation to the agricultural land database a tax office freedom of information officer said: \u201cThe FIRB [Foreign Investment Review Board] team advised that they had received some information regarding relevant agricultural land purchases but the data from this information has not been incorporated into any specific database such as Excel at this stage. I am also advised that the database document is expected to be prepared within the short-term timeframe.\u201d A request for the residential land register produced a similar response. The ATO FOI officer wrote: \u201cAs per the government announcement, the residential land register initiative is not due to be delivered until 1 July 2016. I was also advised that given the extended lead time until its launch date there has been no commencement of the building of the database for this register.\u201d The ATO spokeswoman urged foreign investors to come forward before 30 November \u201cto take advantage of reduced penalties and disclose any breaches of the rules for residential real estate purchases\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s our latest news story on today\u2019s developments: And that\u2019s a good time to stop. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with another live blog, which will include developments from Greece and Portugal - where left-wing parties are expected to overturn the new centre-right government. Thanks, and goodnight. GW The eurozone\u2019s finance ministers have now issued a statement following today\u2019s meeting. It confirms that the Eurogroup called on the Greek authorities to finalise the financial sector measures, as well as the legislation agreed under the first set of milestones, in the course of the week. Once that is done, Greece can unlock \u20ac2bn of aid funds, plus up to\u20ac10bn for the recapitalisation of the Greek banking sector. One late development... Greece\u2019s cabinet will meet on Tuesday at 10.30am (local time) at parliament, the prime minister\u2019s office has announced. That\u2019s via the ANA newswire. So, to recap... Greece has been given until the end of the week to deliver on the outstanding measures agreed with its creditors, so new bailout funds can be handed over. At a eurogroup meeting in Brussels today, eurozone ministers decided that Athens has not done enough to qualify for its next aid tranche. That money, including up to \u20ac10bn to recapitalise its banking sector, won\u2019t be released until various outstanding measures have been taken. In particular, the eurogroup insists that Greece must bring in new rules for banks to handle non-performing loans, such as bad mortgage debts. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government wants to protect poorer citizens from losing their homes - but without new foreclosure rules, Greece\u2019s creditors won\u2019t hand over the funds to rebuild its banks. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told tonight\u2019s press conference that Greece has made \u201ca lot of progress\u201d towards meeting the conditions of its third bailout, agreed this summer. But: The next thing to do is have all the financial sector measures in place before the completion of the recapitalisation process. Our Greek colleague, Euclid Tsakalotos, gave his commitment that this will be done. The eurogroup has thus given Greece until the end of the week to tackle these measures around household insolvency and non-performing loans, so that aid funds can be handed over early next week. Pierre Moscovici, EU commissioner, says that these bad loans need to be cleared up so that the Greek banking sector can return to health. A Greek official has told Reuters that Athens is confident that these issues will be resolved in time, so that the bank recapitalisation funds, and \u20ac2bn of loans for Greece, can be disbursed. But the delay has raised fears that Greece\u2019s 3rd bailout, hammered out this summer, could hit problems if Athens continues to struggle to meet the terms of the deal. With a 24-hour strike scheduled for Thursday, to protest against austerity, Greece\u2019s government is coming under more pressure... And that\u2019s the end of the press conference - all over quite quickly. I\u2019ll pull together a summary now Onto questions: Why is the eurozone refusing to compromise and protect more less wealthy Greeks from the new laws on foreclosures? Pierre Moscovici explains that the Greek banking sector must take action on bad loans if it is to become healthy and credible. He also suggests that some people are \u201cstrategic defaulters\u201d, who have chosen to stop servicing their mortgages. (reminder: Athens wants to protect more primary residences from being repossessed if mortgage holders can\u2019t meet their repayments). And Jeroen Dijsselbloem adds that the issues of non-performing loans, governance issues and bank recapitalisations are all linked. In other words, Greek banks can\u2019t have more money until they take a tougher line on bad debt, and are better managed. Jeroen Dijsselbloem\u2019s media team have tweeted that Greece has until the end of the week to meet the remaining milestones: Klaus Regling, head of the ESM, speaks briefly - and confirms that Greece\u2019s banking sector needs less fresh capital than previously feared. That means the final bailout bill will probably be less than 86bn euros. That\u2019s good for Greece, and good for the ESM, he says. Reuters has seen a statement from the eurogroup, which confirms that money will not be handed over to recapitalise Greece\u2019s banks until Athens has hit all the milestones agreed with its creditors. The statement also notes that Athens has pledged to meet the conditions this week. In the document, the eurozone finance ministers say: \u201cWe await the finalisation of all the measures in the first set of milestones and the financial sector measures which are essential for a successful recapitalisation process.\u201d Last month\u2019s stress tests showed that Greek banks need less than 15 billion euros, less than feared. The eurozone has 10bn euros lined up to recapitalise Greek banks. EU commissioner Pierre Moscovici is also attending the press conference -- he says four-fifths of Greece\u2019s milestones have been achieved. Reminder: you can watch the press conference here. On other issues, Dijsselbloem declares that the recovery in the eurozone is continuing. Dijsselbloem begins by telling reporters in Brussels that \u201ca lot of progress has been\u201d achieved by Greece, in a very cooperative process. He singles out the work towards recapitalising Greece\u2019s banks, which is a key milestone in the bailout deal. But more work is still needed before bailout funds are handed over. And Dijsselbloem confirms that the eurozone working group will be asked to reconvene by next week at the latest, to assess if Greece has done enough to qualify for its first aid tranche. Then the eurogroup finance ministers can assess the situation. And then the ESM board of governance will decide how much money to unlock to recapitalise Greece\u2019s banks. (that\u2019s the European Stability Mechanism; the region\u2019s main bailout vehicle). So for Greece, the clock is ticking (again). It must do more to satisfy its lenders before bailout funds are handed over. The press conference is getting underway now. We\u2019re about to hear whether Greece has been handed its next aid tranche (unlikely), along with what progress was made on those other areas such as Spain, monetary union, and the euro economy. Brussels is overwhelmed with press conferences tonight -- ministers are also discussing the refugee crisis in one room, and the problems of the steel industry in another one. So many problems to solve.... Sounds like the press conference is starting soon! While we wait for tonight\u2019s Eurogroup press conference, here are some photos from this afternoon\u2019s meeting: Kathimerini\u2019s reporter in Brussels, Eleni Varvitsiotis, has details from the eurogroup meeting. She\u2019s heard that euro finance ministers will ask their deputies to resume talks with Greece over the remaining milestones needed before its bailout tranche can be paid. EWG is the Eurozone Working Group - one level below the eurogroup. More from Greece: A downbeat start to the week for European markets was made worse once Wall Street opened and US shares began a rapid slide. Poor Chinese trade data set the tone early on, along with reports that Greece would not get its latest tranche of bailout funds at today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. To add to the gloomy mood, the OECD cut its global growth forecasts. The prospect of a US rate rise in December, despite the continuing worries about a slowdown in global growth, sent American markets sharply lower and caused the falls in Europe to accelerate. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 58.67 points or 0.92% lower at 6295.16 Germany\u2019s Dax ended 1.57% down at 10,815.45 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.46% lower at 4911.17 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.88% to 22,107.30 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.22% lower at 10,325.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.89% to 683.49 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 240 points or 1.33%. Despite the differences between Greece and its creditors over foreclosures, MNI is reporting that the country could present updated proposals at the europgroup meeting. MNI reports: The disagreements pushed [Greek prime minister Alexis] Tsipras to have a round of calls over the weekend with Germany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel, France\u2019s President Francois Hollande and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and asked them for a political solution on the issue. A Greek government official told MNI that Tsipras found \u201csympathetic ears\u201d and that an updated proposal from the Greek side would be presented during the Eurogroup meeting and could bring a deal. The source added that Tsipras stressed that maintaining social cohesion in Greece right now is a top priority and that the poor must be protected at a time where the immigration problem is mounting and could strengthen further the fascist Golden Dawn party. Elsewhere Fitch has cut its rating on Volkswagen from A to BBB+ with a negative outlook, in the wake of the emissions scandal. The ratings agency said: The downgrade reflects the corporate governance, management and internal control issues highlighted by the ongoing emission test crisis related to up to 11 million diesel-powered vehicles. Fitch already incorporated the group\u2019s relatively weak corporate governance in its ratings but we believe that the emergence of a fraud of this magnitude, going either unnoticed or uncorrected by top management for so long is not consistent with a rating in the \u2018A\u2019 category. Volkswagen\u2019s recent admission that it understated carbon dioxide emissions on 800,000 vehicles reinforces this view and highlights the fundamental issue of internal control failure within the group. The full report is here: Fitch Downgrades Volkswagen to \u2018BBB+\u2019; Outlook Negative Here\u2019s what finance ministers are due to discuss at today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, and it\u2019s not just Greece on the agenda: There will be an update from the single resolution board, which will be in charge of preparing and carrying out the resolution of any euro area bank in trouble from next January. Then it\u2019s Greece, and an update on the state of play (spoilers: they are behind schedule). Ministers will also get an update on the economic situation in the eurozone from the European Commission and a briefing from the European Central Bank. They will also discuss the results of the latest review mission to Spain which took place in early October. On top of that, there will be talks about further steps toward economic and monetary union. A fairly downbeat day for European markets has been echoed in early trading across the Atlantic. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 126 points or 0.7%, following the poor trade data from China earlier and news that the OECD had cut its global growth forecasts. The prospect of higher US interest rates in December, following Friday\u2019s stronger than expected non-farm payroll numbers, is also a factor. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.28% while France\u2019s Cac is 0.39% lower. On top of the global growth worries, investors are nervous as the Eurogroup meets, with Greece unlikely to have done enough yet to see the latest \u20ac2bn tranche of bailout funds released. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is virtually flat, down just 0.12%. Time for a quick recap. Eurozone finance ministers have arrived in Brussels to discuss the state of the eurozone economy, and Greece\u2019s bailout programme. A string of ministers have warned that Greece\u2019s next aid tranche, worth \u20ac2bn, will not be approved today. Despite measures taken in recent weeks, Athens has still not done enough to satisfy its lenders. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters that while Greece has made progress, he doesn\u2019t expect to sign off the payment. The main dispute centres on new laws to help banks repossess homes from people who can\u2019t pay their mortgage. The Greek government is still pushing for more first homes to be exempt, but creditors have been sticking to the deal agreed in July. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is hopeful that a compromise can be reached later this week, to unlock the funds. Greece\u2019s economy minister, George Stathakis, has warned that a \u2018political decision\u2019 will be needed; that suggests Athens is hoping that its lenders soften their demands. But despite these problems, Athens is reportedly planning to return to the financial markets next summer. Analysts are concerned that the Greek situation is heating up again, although we\u2019re a long way from a full-blown Grexit crisis. The Eurozone is also facing new upheaval in Portugal. Shares and government bond prices have been hit, as socialist parties prepare to take power. And the OECD has cut its forecasts for global growth. It warned that global trade has weakened sharply in recent months. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, was one of Greece\u2019s more vocal critics last summer. He sounds slightly more upbeat today, pointing out that last month\u2019s stress tests showed Greek banks weren\u2019t in as bad shape as feared..... ....before pointing out that Greece is already lagging behind. Which means no bailout cash today: Valdis Dombrovskis, the EC vice-president in charge of the euro, is speaking to reporters outside the meeting. He says he visited Athens two weeks ago, and saw that the Greek government is committed to implementing its bailout programme. But having said that there are still several issues outstanding, he adds. Wolfgang Schauble also flagged up that Greece has not yet implemented its new privatisation fund. This was a key part of July\u2019s bailout deal, under which \u20ac50bn of Greek assets will be sold off to cover the cost of recapitalising its banking sector. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has arrived at the meeting. He sounds fairly relaxed as he speaks to reporters. Sch\u00e4uble says that Greece has not yet taken all the required steps to qualify for its next aid tranche (according to his knowledge anyway). Here\u2019s the key quote from Eurogroup chief Dijsselbloem, confirming that Greece won\u2019t get its \u20ac2bn today: \u201cThe 2 billion will only be paid out once the institutions give the green light and say that all agreed actions have been carried out and have been implemented. That still has not happened.\u201d Some reaction to Jeroen Dijsselbloem\u2019s comments as he arrived at the eurogroup meeting: An official limo has just deposited Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem at today\u2019s meeting. He gave a brief \u2018doorstep\u2019 to reporters -- it sounds like he\u2019s not expecting to sign off Greece\u2019s next aid tranche today. Dijsselbloem says progress has been made in recent weeks regarding Greece\u2019s banks and reform programmes. But there are still open issues, and a lot more work needs to be done in the next two weeks. The first set of milestones must be completed soon, he adds (which would pave the way to disbursing that \u20ac2bn in new loans). And Dijsselbloem says he can\u2019t speculate about the political crisis in Portugal where left-wing parties could soon win power. My understanding is there will be debate today and tomorrow, says Dijsselbloem. There is always a legitimate government in each country, and that\u2019s the government we work with.... Ministers are starting to arrive at today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting in Brussels. Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has told reporters gathered outside that he hopes Greece will receive its \u20ac2bn aid tranche this week, if not today. Moscovici says he had \u201cvery positive, very fruitful meetings\u201d in Athens last week with prime minister Alexis Tsipras and finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos. The moves are positive. Most of the milestones are already adopted or decided. There is still a way to go. We are not yet completely there, but I am hopeful and confident that with the spirit of compromise, with good co-operation with the authorities we can make it... if not today then in the days to come. We are not far from that, but obviously there is a little way to go. Moscovici then vanished inside, where he (or his team) tweeted this optimistic message too: Shares are falling sharply on the Lisbon stock market, as investors react to the latest political upheaval in Portugal. The main stock index, the PSI 20, has shed more than 2%, as the country\u2019s socialist parties prepare to oust the centre-right administration sworn in two weeks ago. Portuguese sovereign bonds are also continuing to fall, showing greater anxiety over the prospect of an anti-austerity government taking over. The 10-year Portuguese bond is now yielding nearly 2.9%, a jump of 23 basis points. That\u2019s a four-month high. Over the weekend, four left-wing parties put aside their differences to support a legislative programme. They collectively hold a majority of seats in the parliament, following October\u2019s election. Analysts at the Royal Bank of Scotland Group have already warned that the Socialist-led program \u201cis clearly less market-friendly than the one of the incumbent government,\u201d Bloomberg flags up. More here: Now here\u2019s a thing. Greece is apparently hoping to return to the financial markets next year. Government insiders have told the Financial Times that plans are afoot to sell debt in the capital markets in 2016. Despite the wild drama this year (capital controls, failing to repay the IMF, nearly leaving the eurozone), Athens hopes that investors will put their faith in them. The FT says: It won\u2019t be in the first quarter but summer has been talked about,\u201d said a person familiar with the situation. \u201cIt depends on a positive chain reaction of events but discussions have been held.\u201d Full story: Greece plans a return to capital markets Experienced City investors may raise their eyebrows.... On the other hand, Greece hasn\u2019t actually defaulted on the three-year debt it issued last summer: European Commissioner president Jean-Claude Juncker has just welcomed eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem to his office, for talks ahead of this afternoon\u2019s meeting of finance chiefs. Dijsselbloem got the tradition greeting: Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, says investors need to pay attention to Greece again: Rosenstreich is worried that Athens and its eurozone neighbours couldn\u2019t reach agreement on how to handle the repossession of houses from people who are in default on their mortgages. It suggests the whole third bailout deal, agreed after so much angst in July, may be in early trouble. Rosenstreich says: Left-wing Syriza is concerned that the high threshold will expose too many Greece citizens to the loss of their primary properties. In addition, Athens is balking at a 23% take rate on private schools. This feels like a repeat of 8-months ago. The whole world understood that the third bailout agreement made was unsustainable. It was only a matter of time before it unraveled. Getting back to Greece... AFP\u2019s man in Brussels, Danny Kemp, has heard that the outstanding issues between Greece ands its creditors *might* be resolved in a few days. The OECD has also cut its forecast for global growth this year to 2.9%, down from 3%, due to the sharp slide in trade. It also predicts growth of 3.3% in 2016, down from 3.6% previously. The two demonstrators who disrupted David Cameron\u2019s speech have revealed they created a fictitious company to get into the CBI\u2019s flagship event: Perhaps the CBI should get some advice from the European Central Bank, which upgraded its own security systems after a protester jumped on Mario Draghi\u2019s desk this year... The OECD\u2019s latest economic outlook is online here. The OECD has just released its latest economic projections. And the Paris-based thinktank has warned that global growth is threatened by the impact of China\u2019s slowdown on world trade, but raised its forecast for US growth. It also urged richer countries to step up investment while keeping monetary policy loose, as my colleague Katie Allen explains. The thinktank\u2019s twice-yearly outlook highlights risks from emerging markets and weak trade. Presenting the Outlook in Paris, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00eda said: \u201cThe slowdown in global trade and the continuing weakness in investment are deeply concerning. Robust trade and investment and stronger global growth should go hand in hand.\u201d The thinktank edged up its forecast for economic growth in the group of 34 OECD countries this year to 2.0% from 1.9% in June\u2019s outlook, when it had noted a sharp dip in US growth at the opening of 2015. For 2016, it has cut the forecast for OECD countries\u2019 growth to 2.2% from 2.5%. The OECD left its forecasts for the UK little changed with growth of 2.4% this year and next, compared with a forecast for 2016 growth of 2.3% made in June. The US economy, the world\u2019s biggest, is now seen growing 2.4% this year and 2.5% in 2016, compared with June\u2019s forecasts of 2.0% and 2.8%. On the UK, the OECD said economic growth was projected to \u201ccontinue at a robust pace over the coming two years, driven by domestic demand.\u201d Greece\u2019s economy minister, George Stathakis, has suggested that eurozone governments might have to take a \u2018political decision\u2019 on whether Greece should get its \u20ac2bn aid tranche. Stathakis told Real FM radio that talks with officials over how to enforce foreclosure laws have run their course: The thorny issue is the distance that separates us on the issue of protecting primary residences. \u201cI think the negotiations we conducted with the institutions has closed its cycle .. so it\u2019s a political decision which must be taken. Two eurozone officials have told the Wall Street Journal that there\u2019s no chance that Greece will get its \u20ac2bn bailout loan at today\u2019s eurogroup meeting. That won\u2019t please Michel Sapin, given his optimistic comments earlier. But it appears that Greece simply hasn\u2019t done enough to satisfy lenders.... ...in particular, over how to treat householders who can\u2019t repay their mortgages. Athens and its creditors are still divided over which householders should be protected from foreclosure. The WSJ\u2019s Gabriele Steinhauser and Viktoria Dendrinou explains: Senior officials from the currency union\u2019s finance ministries were updated on Greece\u2019s implementation of around 50 promised overhauls, known as milestones, during a conference call Sunday afternoon. While progress has been made on some issues\u2014including measures to substitute a tax on private education, the governance of the country\u2019s bailed-out banks and the treatment of overdue loans\u2014Athens and its creditors will need more time to sign off on all overhauls, the officials said. Greece needs the fresh loans to pay salaries and bills and settle domestic arrears. However, the government faces no immediate major payments to its international creditors, reducing the sense of urgency. There will be \u201cno agreement on [the] \u20ac2 billion,\u201d one official said. Drama at the CBI conference! David Cameron\u2019s speech has been briefly disrupted by protesters, chanting that the CBI is the \u201cvoice of Brussels\u201d. They\u2019re clearly unhappy that Britain\u2019s top business group is firmly in favour of EU membership: Cameron handles it pretty well - suggesting they ask him a question rather than looking foolish. Another important meeting is taking place in Brussels today. UK business secretary Sajid Javid will discuss the crisis in Britain\u2019s steel works with EU economy and industry ministers this afternoon. Steel unions have urged Javid to demand a clampdown on cheap steel imports from China, which they blame for triggering thousands of job cuts across the UK steel industry: David Cameron is telling the CBI that he\u2019s met business concerns, by cutting red tape and corporate taxes. On infrastructure, he says the government has made progress - citing the planned HS2 railway - but admits there\u2019s more to do. We want to the most business friendly, enterprise friendly, government in the world, he adds. But the PM also acknowledges that Britain must do better on exports. And he\u2019s now outlining a new plan to give everyone guaranteed access to broadband, by 2020. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering all the key points in his politics liveblog: Heads-up: prime minister David Cameron is addressing the CBI\u2019s annual conference in London. There\u2019s a live feed here. He\u2019s expected to warn that he could consider campaigning to leave the EU, if his attempts to reform Britain\u2019s relationship with Brussels is met with a \u2018deaf ear\u2019. The prospect of yet another tussle over Greece\u2019s bailout programme is casting a pall over Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning. The main indices are mainly in the red, as investors prepare to hear the dreaded phrase \u2018eurogroup deadlock\u2019 again. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says that Greece\u2019s \u201csluggish progress\u201d over implementing foreclosure rules is an unwelcome reminder of the eurozone\u2019s lingering issues. The country\u2019s next \u20ac2 billion tranche, which should be signed off at today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, is currently being withheld by Greece\u2019s creditors, who are dissatisfied with the way the region\u2019s hot potato has (or hasn\u2019t) implemented the required reforms. It\u2019 D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, as China\u2019s stock market is pushed up by stimulus hopes, and Greece\u2019s bailout hits a snag. Open Europe analyst Raoul Ruparel points out that today\u2019s dispute is small potatoes, compared to the big challenge of cutting Greece\u2019s debt pile. Greece is also clashing with its creditors over plans to hike the tax rate for private education, as the Telegraph\u2019s Mehreen Khan explains: That\u2019s a slightly unusual issue for a hard-left party to go to the barricades over, when it needs agreement with its lenders to unlock the big prize of debt relief. France is playing its traditional role as Greece\u2019s ally, ahead of today\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance chiefs. French finance minister Michel Sapin has told reporters in Paris that he hopes an agreement can be reached today over the main outstanding hurdle -- how to handle bad loans at Greek banks (as explained earlier). Sapin offered Athens his support, saying: Greece is making considerable efforts. They are scrupulously respecting the July agreement. One thorny issue remains: the seizure of homes for households who can\u2019t pay their debts. I want an agreement to be reached today. France wants an agreement today. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Greek journalist Nick Malkoutzis of Kathimerini tweets that the gloss is coming off Alexis Tsipras\u2019s new administration: The prospect of a new anti-austerity government taking power in Portugal is hitting its government debt this morning. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year Portuguese bonds has risen from 2.67% to 2.77%, a ten-week high. That\u2019s not a major move, but a sign that investors are anxious about events in Lisbon. This new dispute over Greece\u2019s bailout comes three days before unions hold a general strike that could bring Athens to a standstill. The main public and private sector unions have both called 24-hour walkouts for Thursday, to protest against the pension cuts and tax rises contained in its third bailout deal. ADEDY, the civil servants union, accused the government of taking over \u201cthe role of redistributing poverty\u201d. Just six week after winning re-election, Alexis Tsipras is facing quite a wave of discontent.... The Dow Jones newswire is reporting that eurozone finance ministers definitely won\u2019t agree to release Greece\u2019s next aid tranche at today\u2019s meeting, due to the lack of progress over its bailout measures: Greek officials have already warned that the argument over legislation covering bad loans won\u2019t be resolved easily. One told Reuters that: There is a distance with lenders on that [foreclosure] issue, and I don\u2019t think that we will have an agreement soon. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras discussed the issue with Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday. The official added that those talks were a step towards resolving the issue at \u201ca political level\u201d; Greek-speak for a compromise hammered out between leaders, rather than lowly negotiators. After a couple of quiet months, Greece\u2019s debt crisis has loomed back into the spotlight today. A new dispute between Athens and her creditors is holding up the disbursement of Greece\u2019s next aid tranche, worth \u20ac2bn. Athens spent last weekend in a fevered attempt to persuade its creditors that it has met the terms agreed last summer, to qualify for the much-needed cash. But it appears that lenders aren\u2019t convinced, meaning that the payment won\u2019t be signed off when eurogroup ministers meet in Brussels at 2pm today for a Eurogroup meeting. The two sides are still arguing over new laws to repossess houses from people who are deep in arrears on their mortgage payments. Athens is trying to dilute the terms agreed in July\u2019s bailout deal, but eurozone creditors are sticking to their guns. They insist that Greek residences valued above \u20ac120,000 should be covered by the foreclosure laws, down from the current level of \u20ac200,000. The Kathimerini newspaper explains: The key stumbling block is primary residence foreclosures. Greece has put forward stricter criteria that protects 60 percent of homeowners, while suggesting that this is then gradually reduced over the next years. With a deal unlikely today, officials are now racing to get an agreement within 48 hours or so: Greece told to break bailout deadlock by Wednesday And Greece certainly needs the money, to settle overdue payments owed to hundreds of government suppliers who have been squeezed badly this year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Across the globe, investors are finally facing the prospect that the long run of record low interest rates is ending, at least in America. There\u2019s now a 70% chance that the US Federal Reserve hikes borrowing costs in next month\u2019s meeting, according to this morning\u2019s data. This follows Friday\u2019s strong US jobs report, which show 271,000 new positions created last month. With earnings rising too, Fed doves will probably be tempted to finally press the rate hike button at December\u2019s meeting. That is pushing up the dollar this morning, and weakening the euro. That will please the European Central Bank, as it ponders whether to launch its own new stimulus measures. European stock markets are expected to inch higher at the open: Also coming up.... The OECD will issue new economic forecasts at 10.30am GMT. Britain\u2019s business leaders are gathering in London for the CBI\u2019s latest conference. The event is dominated by the UK\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum, and claims that the CBI is too pro-EU. Eurozone finance ministers are holding a eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon. And there is fresh drama in the eurozone. In Portugal, three left-wing parties have agreed to work together in a new \u201canti-austerity government\u201d. That will bring down minority administration created by Pedro Passos Coelho two weeks ago, after October\u2019s inconclusive election. And with Greece struggling to implement its own austerity measures, Europe\u2019s problems are pushing up the agenda again. We\u2019ll be covering all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "European politicians have promised \u201cfull and speedier\u201d measures to stem the tide of cheap Chinese imports blamed for bringing Britain\u2019s steel industry to its knees. The pledge came as Europe\u2019s largest steelmakers called for immediate action to save an industry that has shed 85,000 jobs across the continent since 2008. It followed a crunch EU summit on Monday attended by the Conservative business secretary, Sajid Javid, amid fierce criticism of the UK government\u2019s handling of the steel crisis. UK steel companies have announced 5,000 job cuts in a matter of weeks, blaming unfairly subsidised Chinese imports, high energy costs and business rates, and a strong pound. Unions have expressed huge disappointment at the outcome of the meeting. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community union, said: \u201cCouncil ministers and the (European) Commission have clearly failed to grasp the urgency of the current situation. Steelworkers whose jobs are at risk and who are seeing the impact of the dumping of cheap steel will take very little comfort from the conclusions of today\u2019s meeting. \u201cWe need action now and would have at least expected a clear statement of intent from the meeting that they will speed up reform of trade defence instruments or introduce other measures so that European steel producers are better protected from dumping. \u201cThe promise of yet another meeting of steel stakeholders only delays the action the industry requires. The summit also failed to give a proper view on the impact of China gaining market economy status, which will pose an existential threat to the European steel industry. Speaking after the summit, Luxembourg\u2019s economy minister, Etienne Schneider, who chaired the talks, promised to \u201cdeliver the right conditions\u201d to ease a \u201chuge crisis\u201d for Europe\u2019s steelmakers. Schneider stopped short of a suggestion from the European Steel Association (Eurofer) to use China\u2019s attempt to win Market Economy Status from the World Trade Organisation as a bargaining chip. Once granted, the status would make it easier for Chinese companies to defend themselves against anti-dumping cases brought by the WTO. Schneider was also tight-lipped about the industry body\u2019s recommendation of a \u201csurveillance\u201d system to monitor imports more closely. Instead, he said Europe would consider proposals to give energy-intensive businesses such as steel an easier ride under the emissions trading scheme, which is aimed at reducing CO2 emissions. He also said politicians would try to make trade defence measures \u201cfull and speedier\u201d. Higher import duties can be imposed on specific products when foreign countries are deemed to be dumping supply into Europe. However, firms say they can take up to a year to enforce. Steelmakers want the system to move as quickly as it does in the US, where extra tariffs can be raised in a matter of weeks. They say this would counteract Chinese firms \u2013 subsidised by artificially cheap \u201csoft loans\u201d from Beijing \u2013 flooding Europe with cheap steel to offset waning domestic demand. \u201cTo avoid imminent, irreparable damage to the EU steel industry, policymakers need to take immediate action, using the full set of available trade defence instruments, including speeding up the imposition of measures,\u201d said Eurofer. European commission rules also allow for temporary trade restrictions when there is an \u201cunforeseen, sharp and sudden increase in imports\u201d. But steelmakers believe the criteria required to impose such safeguards are too onerous. The Tata Steel chief executive, Dr Karl-Ulrich K\u00f6hler, was expected at a dinner with ministers in Brussels on Monday night to urge politicians to sharpen these tools. K\u00f6hler, who announced 1,200 UK job cuts last month, said the sense of urgency among British politicians had increased a lot, but added: \u201cCan we expect at this moment clear actions? No.\u201d \u201cThe US and other countries have already moved to prevent cheap Chinese imports distorting their markets and now the EU must do the same \u2013 and quickly,\u201d said Gareth Stace, director of trade body UK Steel. British firms have complained that they are also being hurt by high business rates and energy costs, both of which they say are far more burdensome than in the rest of Europe. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Angela Eagle, said: \u201cThe government is sitting on its hands and has shown an unwillingness to take the strategic and decisive action required.\u201d Steelworkers ramped up the pressure on the Javid by staging a protest outside the Brussels summit. Union sources said staff from Teesside, Rotherham, Scunthorpe and south Wales travelled to Brussels on the same Eurostar train as the business secretary. Chinese steel imports to the UK have more than doubled since 2013 to 616,808 tonnes, with three months of the year still to go, according to the International Steel Statistics Bureau. The influx has seen the price of hot rolled coil \u2013 a bellwether of European steel \u2013 slump 20% in a year from \u20ac417.5 (\u00a3297) per tonne to \u20ac335, while the People\u2019s Republic will provide around half of Britain\u2019s reinforcing steel \u2013 used in construction to strengthen concrete \u2013 in 2015. China accounts for about 50% of global steel production. The EU\u2019s share has fallen from 22% in 2001 to 10%. Britain\u2019s steel industry, which employed more than a quarter of a million people in 1967, has suffered a parallel period of decline that could cut the industry\u2019s total headcount to just 25,000. Indian-owned Tata Steel\u2019s 1,200 jobs added to layoffs by Caparo and Thailand\u2019s SSI, which put the Redcar steelworks on Teesside into liquidation. Angad Paul, the chief executive of struggling firm Caparo \u2013 set up by his steel magnate father Lord Paul \u2013 was found dead on Sunday morning after falling from his central London flat. Schneider said the EU would now intensify talks with steel producers such as China and Russia, as well as holding a second summit, this time including steel industry figures, before the end of the year. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community union, said: \u201cCouncil ministers and the [European] commission have clearly failed to grasp the urgency of the current situation faced by the steel industry. Steelworkers whose jobs are at risk and who are seeing the impact of the dumping of cheap steel will take very little comfort from the conclusions of today\u2019s meeting. \u201cWe need action now and would have at least expected a clear statement of intent from the meeting that they will speed up reform of trade defence instruments or introduce other measures so that European steel producers are better protected from dumping. \u201cThe promise of yet another meeting of steel stakeholders only delays the action the industry requires.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Tesco, Dave Lewis, has said retailers face a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d as profits slump but costs rise because of business rates and the national living wage. Lewis said jobs were on the line in an industry that employs three million people, with the possibility that shops could close and prices on the high street could increase to pay for the extra costs. In a clear message to George Osborne to take action to support the industry, Lewis said retailers faced \u00a314bn of extra costs in the next five years from an increase in business rates and the introduction by the chancellor of the national living wage in 2016. This is at a time when profitability in the industry is at its lowest level ever due to changes in shopping habits, price deflation and the rise of online shopping. \u201cIn supermarkets, profitability has sunk from [margins of] 5% to 2% in five years and now we face significant new cost pressure. This is a potentially lethal cocktail,\u201d Lewis told the CBI annual conference. He said the business rates system was unsustainable and disproportionate, and an urgent review of the tax was needed. Retailers will pay \u00a38bn in business rates this year, a quarter of the UK total. It is by far the biggest tax the industry pays: for every \u00a31 a large retailer pays in corporation tax, the company pays \u00a32.31 in business rates. Tesco\u2019s business rates bill has risen by 35% in the last five years at a time when profits have fallen significantly. Lewis said: \u201cOver the last five years property values have fallen, profits are down but business rates are up. Quietly but dramatically. Business rates have hit \u00a38bn for retail. That\u2019s over a quarter of the bill and significantly more than any other sector. That\u2019s an enormous pressure. Shops have closed. Businesses lost. Jobs sacrificed.\u201d Lewis urged the government to consult with leading retailers about tax and regulation changes, warning that the national living wage could have unintended consequences when it comes into force. Businesses will be required to pay at least \u00a37.20 per hour to workers over the age of 25, rising to \u00a39 by 2020. He said: \u201cOur concern, and the concern of many colleagues, is that there is pressure to increase base pay at the expense of benefits. We don\u2019t think this is the answer. We shouldn\u2019t simply strip down employment to an hourly rate or draw arbitrary lines. It\u2019s more complex than that. \u201cBenefits are hugely important to our colleagues, valuable too. Our workforce is not homogeneous. Our colleagues say they value different things at different stages in their lives and at Tesco this is what we are trying to accommodate. We need a fuller debate aimed at doing the right thing for the people in our industry without imposing more cost, without providing individual benefit or business return. \u201cAt Tesco we\u2019re working on a menu of benefits which gives colleagues flexibility of choice and support which they value \u2013 including a competitive pension scheme, a 5% turnaround bonus, colleague discount, plus the opportunity to invest in the business through save as you earn. As an industry there is a worry that the unintended consequences of the living wage have not been fully thought through.\u201d Lewis also claimed that a reduction in the salt content of Tesco\u2019s own-brand products had saved 1,500 lives. On Monday shares in the company fell again on the back of analyst downgrades. Tesco shares fell 2.48p, or 1.4%, to 180.42p after Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said \u201cso much more needs to be done for Tesco UK to be a destination of choice\u201d for shoppers.",

      "bodyText": "European leaders have told Greece that it must do more to prove it is pushing through the reforms its creditors have demanded before it can receive a \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.4bn) aid payment. The debt-stricken country has been at odds with its lenders over the protection it can offer families at risk of being made homeless because of mortgage defaults. Greece clinched an \u20ac86bn bailout in the summer, in return for promising measures to reduce its deficit such as higher VAT rates and pension cuts. Its lenders have also demanded new laws to help banks repossess homes from people who cannot meet their loan repayments. The new sticking point turned the buildup to a key Brussels meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Monday night into a series of tit-for-tat briefings reminiscent of the height of the bailout crisis earlier this year. Greece\u2019s EU peers continued to lament the pace of economic reform in Athens, while the country\u2019s leftwing government under the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has stood by demands for social safeguards for its citizens. On the contentious repossession rules, it wants more first homes to be exempt. At stake is the release of Greece\u2019s next tranche of aid from its third bailout. Athens spent the weekend trying to persuade its creditors that it had met the terms agreed this summer to qualify for the much-needed cash. Ahead of the Eurogroup meeting, however, it appeared they were not convinced. \u201cThe \u20ac2bn will only be paid out once the institutions give the green light and say that all agreed actions have been carried out and have been implemented. That still has not happened,\u201d the Eurogroup president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said as he arrived at the Brussels meeting. The European economic commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, was slightly more upbeat, expressing hope that a compromise could be reached later this week to unlock the funds from Greece\u2019s third rescue package in five years. Following the Eurogroup meeting, Moscovici tweeted: Greece\u2019s economy minister, George Stathakis, appeared to suggest Athens was hoping its lenders would soften their demands, saying ahead of the meeting that eurozone governments might have to take a political decision on whether to release the next aid payment. He said talks with officials over how to enforce foreclosure laws had run their course. \u201cThe thorny issue is the distance that separates us on the issue of protecting primary residences,\u201d he told Real FM radio. \u201cI think the negotiation we conducted with the institutions has closed its cycle \u2026 so it\u2019s a political decision which must be taken.\u201d A Greek government official told reporters after the Eurogroup meeting that it was optimistic a deal would be reached with its lenders by next week. Analysts said the tensions had echoes of early summer, when Greece appeared to be on the brink of expulsion from the eurozone. A so-called Grexit was averted when the third bailout deal was hammered out, but it was met with scepticism given the scale of reforms demanded of Greece, which come on top of years of austerity, barely any economic growth, and high unemployment. \u201cThis feels like a repeat of eight months ago. The whole world understood that the third bailout agreement made was unsustainable. It was only a matter of time before it unraveled,\u201d said Peter Rosenstreich, the head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank.",

    "webTitle": "Vote Leave's CBI stunt spoils fair criticism on nuance-free EU stance | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "How to spoil a half-decent point with a silly stunt. The Vote Leave students who heckled David Cameron\u2019s speech to the CBI conference came across as wanting to squash debate on Europe. If, as suggested, similar protests are planned at the annual meetings of companies with pro-EU bosses, the tactic will become tiresome and probably self-defeating. Yet, on the narrow issue of the CBI\u2019s utterances on Europe, there is a fair criticism to make. The problem is not that the CBI gets 0.6% of its funding from the European commission for use of its economic surveys \u2013 the percentage is so small it is not worth making a fuss about. Rather, the difficulty is twofold. First, CBI wonks, while championing the virtues of the UK staying in a \u201creformed\u201d EU, always refuse to say which of its desired reforms, if undelivered, would be a deal-breaker, if any. The position looks a cop-out. The second factor is the breezy confidence with which CBI leaders talk about what business \u201cthinks\u201d about Europe. It is people, not organisations, who do the thinking and any single company is likely to contain a range of views. The CBI is probably right that most directors are favourably inclined towards the EU, but its tone is often too dogmatic. \u201cBusiness must be crystal-clear that membership is in our national interest,\u201d said recently retired president Sir Mike Rake in May. No room for nuance there. Paul Drechsler, Rake\u2019s successor, did at least nod to some of the criticisms on Sunday by acknowledging that there is no uniform business view of EU membership. But then he spoiled the effect by arguing that \u201cbusiness leaders should let their employees, communities, customers and suppliers know what the referendum means for growth and jobs\u201d. Let them know? This is not Downton Abbey, and employees are not waiting breathlessly to be told what to think by their bosses. Lonmin share offer an unlikely investment gem Cash calls don\u2019t come much more desperate than this. Investors in Lonmin, the world\u2019s third-biggest platinum miner, are being offered the chance to buy 46 shares for every one they own at a 94% discount to last week\u2019s share price \u2013 1p versus 17p. With terms like that, you might expect the underwriting banks (HSBC, JP Morgan and Standard Bank) to cut their fees for the job. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Lonmin is a pauper and is being taken to the cleaners. Of the $407m (\u00a3270m) being raised, the company will see just $369m \u2013 the gap of $38m is enormous, even if it also covers arrangement fees on a new $370m borrowing facility. Still, the option of not underwriting the issue was probably a non-starter given that Lonmin had warned it could run out of cash without a fresh injection of funds. This is the company\u2019s third cash call in six years and the fear that shareholders would be reluctant to throw good money after bad was real. In practical terms, the arrival of $369m will ensure that chief executive Ben Magara gets one last chance to ensure Lonmin\u2019s survival within South Africa\u2019s oversupplied, dangerous and strike-prone platinum industry. There are two possible reasons for optimism. First, Magara seems to enjoy better relations with the main trade unions than recent Lonmin bosses: he has managed to complete half the planned 6,000 job losses among a 36,000 workforce without a strike. Second, Lonmin \u2013 belatedly \u2013 has done itself a favour by concentrating on lower cost mines and giving up on chasing higher volumes of production across its portfolio, which had been 2012\u2019s strategy. Unfortunately, there are also reasons to worry that a smaller workforce and lower levels of capital expenditure may not be enough. The platinum price has fallen by a third in the past 15 months and the often predicted upturn seems constantly to slip away over the horizon. And, while industrial relations may have improved since the appalling Marikana massacre in 2012, nobody is pretending that sweet harmony has arrived, or is even possible. Last year, the main platinum producers in South Africa, including Lonmin, suffered a five-month strike. Shareholders will take up their rights because they don\u2019t have much real choice \u2013 but they will do so more in the hope of salvation rather than expectation.",

If, as suggested, similar protests are planned at the annual meetings of companies with pro-EU bosses, the tactic will become tiresome and probably self-defeating.</p> <p>Yet, on the narrow issue of the CBI\u2019s utterances on Europe, there is a fair criticism to make. The problem is not that the CBI gets 0.6% of its funding from the European commission for use of its economic surveys \u2013 the percentage is so small it is not worth making a fuss about.</p> <p>Rather, the difficulty is twofold. First, CBI wonks, while championing the virtues of the UK staying in a \u201creformed\u201d EU, always refuse to say which of its desired reforms, if undelivered, would be a deal-breaker, if any. The position looks a cop-out.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/nov/09/david-cameron-heckled-anti-eu-protesters-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4e37e\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2403716\"            data-video-name=\"David Cameron heckled by anti-EU protesters \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            data-video-poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/9/1447068042014/KP_592341_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56408193e4b0395df3f473bf\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/9/1447068042014/KP_592341_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/09/151109Heckle_2_KP-25926954_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/09/151109Heckle_2_KP-25926954.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10930706&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/09/151109Heckle_2_KP-25926954_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/09/151109Heckle_2_KP-25926954_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2015/nov/09/david-cameron-heckled-anti-eu-protesters-video\">David Cameron is heckled by anti-EU protesters</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The second factor is the breezy confidence with which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/06/cbi-business-opinion-eu-referendum\">CBI leaders talk about what business \u201cthinks\u201d about Europe</a>. It is people, not organisations, who do the thinking and any single company is likely to contain a range of views. The CBI is probably right that most directors are favourably inclined towards the EU, but its tone is often too dogmatic. \u201cBusiness must be crystal-clear that membership is in our national interest,\u201d said recently retired president Sir Mike Rake in May. No room for nuance there.</p> <p>Paul Drechsler, Rake\u2019s successor, did at least nod to some of the criticisms on Sunday by acknowledging that there is no uniform business view of EU membership. But then he spoiled the effect by arguing that \u201cbusiness leaders should let their employees, communities, customers and suppliers know what the referendum means for growth and jobs\u201d.</p> <p>Let them know? This is not Downton Abbey, and employees are not waiting breathlessly to be told what to think by their bosses.</p> <h2>Lonmin share offer an unlikely investment gem</h2> <p>Cash calls don\u2019t come much more desperate than this. Investors in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/24/anglo-american-and-lonmin-cut-jobs-amid-commodity-slump\">Lonmin</a>, the world\u2019s third-biggest platinum miner, are being offered the chance to buy 46 shares for every one they own at a 94% discount to last week\u2019s share price \u2013 1p versus 17p.</p> <p>With terms like that, you might expect the underwriting banks (HSBC, JP Morgan and Standard Bank) to cut their fees for the job. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Lonmin is a pauper and is being taken to the cleaners. Of the $407m (\u00a3270m) being raised, the company will see just $369m \u2013 the gap of $38m is enormous, even if it also covers arrangement fees on a new $370m borrowing facility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e9a429366f7dfe53750fbce9210be3e9fbfcab20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a429366f7dfe53750fbce9210be3e9fbfcab20/0_148_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Marikana platinum mine run by Lonmin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Marikana platinum mine run by Lonmin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, the option of not underwriting the issue was probably a non-starter given that Lonmin had warned it could run out of cash without a fresh injection of funds. This is the company\u2019s third cash call in six years and the fear that shareholders would be reluctant to throw good money after bad was real.</p> <p>In practical terms, the arrival of $369m will ensure that chief executive Ben Magara gets one last chance to ensure Lonmin\u2019s survival within South Africa\u2019s oversupplied, dangerous and strike-prone platinum industry. There are two possible reasons for optimism.</p> <p>First, Magara seems to enjoy better relations with the main trade unions than recent Lonmin bosses: he has managed to complete half the planned 6,000 job losses among a 36,000 workforce without a strike. Second, Lonmin \u2013 belatedly \u2013 has done itself a favour by concentrating on lower cost mines and giving up on chasing higher volumes of production across its portfolio, which had been 2012\u2019s strategy.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are also reasons to worry that a smaller workforce and lower levels of capital expenditure may not be enough. The platinum price has fallen by a third in the past 15 months and the often predicted upturn seems constantly to slip away over the horizon. And, while industrial relations may have improved since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/marikana-massacre-untold-story-strike-leader-died-workers-rights\">the appalling Marikana massacre in 2012</a>, nobody is pretending that sweet harmony has arrived, or is even possible. Last year, the main platinum producers in South Africa, including Lonmin, suffered a five-month strike.</p> <p>Shareholders will take up their rights because they don\u2019t have much real choice \u2013 but they will do so more in the hope of salvation rather than expectation.</p>",

Match Group will be hoping sufficient investors \u201cswipe right\u201d to get the deal off to a good start. Over the past month, almost every initial public offering (IPO) has priced below its range amid lingering nervousness about new issues initially raised by the Chinese stock market crisis. Last week the $3bn flotation of the food delivery business Hello Fresh was postponed in Frankfurt, with the group citing uncertain market conditions. At the end of last month the same fate befell the intended flotation in France of the loss-making music streaming service Deezer. However, Match is a profitable internet business, reporting profits of $148.4m in 2014, up 17%. Revenues rose by 11% to $888.3m. Some analysts suggest the pace of revenue growth could slow as the group is forced to spend an increasing amount on product development. The group includes the dating sites Chemistry.com, Delightful, HowAboutWe, Match, Meetic, OkCupid, People Media, Tinder and Twoo, as well as the fitness site DailyBurn and the tutoring businesses Tutor.com and The Princeton Review. Match will be selling 14% of itself to new investors and hoping to raise $537m. But those who invest will only have 1.6% of the voting power, with the parent company, Barry Diller\u2019s InterActiveCorp (IAC), hanging on to the remainder. Tinder currently focuses primarily on photos, but there are plans to include more information to make personality feature more prominently. Tinder\u2019s chief executive, Sean Rad, said at a recent summit: \u201cWe\u2019re about to announce a huge change we\u2019ve made to the algorithm and we have increased the number of matches by over 30%.\u201d He said the app\u2019s users would get \u201cdeeper connections\u201d and would see a \u201cseries of things that will help you make more sense of the sheer volume of people around you\u201d. The company\u2019s 80-page plus prospectus points out the risks of a security breach in the aftermath of the hacking of the database of the infidelity website Ashley Madison. It says: \u201cWe are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience, or additional regulation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Volkswagen offers $1,000 gift cards as 'goodwill package' to US owners", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After months of apologies, Volkswagen has a solution to appease angry US motorists caught up in its emissions scandal: gift cards. Under the headline \u201cWe\u2019re Working to Make Things Right\u201d, Volkswagen on Monday launched a webpage where VW owners can enter their vehicle identification numbers and learn whether they qualify to receive up to $1,000 to compensate them for their unwitting role in one of the worst car scandals in history. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said in September that some 500,000 US Volkswagen vehicles with two-liter, four-cylinder diesel engines were failing to meet US emissions standards and had been equipped with software designed to fool emissions tests. Vehicles that had been sold on promises they were greener than the average car were in fact emitting up to 40 times the nitrous oxides allowed by law in its exhaust fumes, according to the EPA, and had been programmed to cheat on compliance tests. Volkswagen has since admitted that about 11m cars worldwide currently carry the cheating software. The scandal has devastated VW\u2019s image in the US, a market it has struggled to crack. At least 200 lawsuits have been filed against Volkswagen since the scandal broke. VW owners are angry at being asked to give up their cars to have them repaired, but more broadly there is widespread fury at the company for capitalizing on its image as safe and environmentally friendly in a market anxious about climate change. \u201cOver the past several weeks, we\u2019ve apologized to our loyal customers about the 2.0L TDI emissions issue,\u201d the company wrote on its voucher redemption site. \u201cAs we work tirelessly to develop a remedy, we ask for your continued patience.\u201d The \u201cgoodwill package\u201d is available to registered owners or lessees as of Sunday; anyone wanting to claim the $1,000 in gift cards will have to do so by 30 April 2016. The scandal cost VW CEO Michael Winterkorn his job and has widened as the investigation continues: over the weekend, it was revealed by German newspaper Bild am Sonntag that the company had allegedly engaged in yet broader environmental compliance test cheating, much of it less high-tech and affecting an additional 800,000 vehicles. Appearing before Congress in October, Volkswagen America\u2019s new CEO Michael Horn attributed the faults to \u201ca couple of software engineers who put this in for whatever reasons\u201d and said that he had had no knowledge of the deception prior to a meeting with the EPA. The company lost the top sales spot among carmakers to Japanese rival Toyota at the end of October. Sales were flat for the company\u2019s first financial report since the scandal and sales figures rose last month, but analysts attributed the gains to steep discounts being offered by the firm. The company released its newest model, the 2016 Passat, almost at the moment the scandal broke. US authorities are strictly overseeing VW\u2019s plans to fix its vehicles. The company was handed further woes on Monday when Germany\u2019s transport ministry said that software fixes wouldn\u2019t work for about a quarter of that country\u2019s diesel VW vehicles. Those cars will need to be recalled and retrofitted with better hardware, as well. Volkswagen shares fell precipitously in September and have not recovered; the market dipped on news of the customer payout as well. There are likely to be more falls to come. Also on Monday, Fitch, the credit rating agency, downgraded Volkswagen\u2019s debt by two notches to reflect the potential financial costs of the scandal, as well as the management problems that led to the crisis in the first place. The downgrade follows a similar move by Moody\u2019s last week. Fitch cited the \u201cpossibility of further problems still to be uncovered\u201d by the company\u2019s internal investigation as well as \u201crelatively weak corporate governance\u201d. Early in October, Kelley Blue Book said the average resale value of Volkswagens with two-liter diesel engines fell 13% since mid-September, when VW admitted it cheated on the tests. Used car values often drop in autumn, since demand for them is stronger in the summer. But VW\u2019s diesel decline is unusually large. The price of gas-powered Volkswagens dropped 2% in the same period. Volkswagen is already offering $2,000 to current VW owners to trade in their cars for new vehicles, and the gift cards and vouchers would add $1,000 to that. The scandal expanded last week, when the EPA accused VW of cheating with different software on larger six-cylinder diesels in about 10,000 vehicles. VW also acknowledged finding irregularities in carbon dioxide emissions in 800,000 other vehicles, all outside the US. Some of those were powered by gasoline engines.",

VW owners are angry at being asked to give up their cars to have them repaired, but more broadly there is widespread fury at the company for capitalizing on its image as safe and environmentally friendly in a market anxious about climate change.</p> <p>\u201cOver the past several weeks, we\u2019ve apologized to our loyal customers about the 2.0L TDI emissions issue,\u201d the company wrote on its voucher redemption site. \u201cAs we work tirelessly to develop a remedy, we ask for your continued patience.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cgoodwill package\u201d is available to registered owners or lessees as of Sunday; anyone wanting to claim the $1,000 in gift cards will have to do so by 30 April 2016.</p> <p>The scandal cost VW CEO Michael Winterkorn his job and has widened as the investigation continues: over the weekend, it was revealed by German newspaper Bild am Sonntag that the company had allegedly engaged in yet broader environmental compliance test cheating, much of it less high-tech and affecting an additional 800,000 vehicles.</p> <p>Appearing before Congress in October, Volkswagen America\u2019s new CEO Michael Horn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/oct/08/head-of-vw-america-testifies-us-congress-emissions-live-updates\">attributed the faults</a> to \u201ca couple of software engineers who put this in for whatever reasons\u201d and said that he had had no knowledge of the deception prior to a meeting with the EPA.</p> <p>The company lost the top sales spot among carmakers to Japanese rival Toyota at the end of October. Sales were flat for the company\u2019s first financial report since the scandal and sales figures <a href=\"http://media.vw.com/release/1100/\">rose last month</a>, but analysts attributed the gains to steep discounts being offered by the firm. The company released its newest model, the 2016 Passat, almost at the moment the scandal broke.</p> <p>US authorities are strictly overseeing VW\u2019s plans to fix its vehicles. The company was handed further woes on Monday when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/09/vw-repair-germany-540000-cars-hardware-changes\">Germany\u2019s transport ministry said</a> that software fixes wouldn\u2019t work for about a quarter of that country\u2019s diesel VW vehicles. Those cars will need to be recalled and retrofitted with better hardware, as well.</p> <p>Volkswagen shares fell precipitously in September and have not recovered; the market dipped on news of the customer payout as well. There are likely to be more falls to come.</p> <p>Also on Monday, Fitch, the credit rating agency, downgraded Volkswagen\u2019s debt by two notches to reflect the potential financial costs of the scandal, as well as the management problems that led to the crisis in the first place. The downgrade follows a similar move by Moody\u2019s last week. Fitch cited the \u201cpossibility of further problems still to be uncovered\u201d by the company\u2019s internal investigation as well as \u201crelatively weak corporate governance\u201d.</p> <p>Early in October, Kelley Blue Book said the average resale value of Volkswagens with two-liter diesel engines fell 13% since mid-September, when VW admitted it cheated on the tests. Used car values often drop in autumn, since demand for them is stronger in the summer. But VW\u2019s diesel decline is unusually large. The price of gas-powered Volkswagens dropped 2% in the same period.</p> <p>Volkswagen is already offering $2,000 to current VW owners to trade in their cars for new vehicles, and the gift cards and vouchers would add $1,000 to that. The scandal expanded last week, when the EPA accused VW of cheating with different software on larger six-cylinder diesels in about 10,000 vehicles. VW also acknowledged finding irregularities in carbon dioxide emissions in 800,000 other vehicles, all outside the US. Some of those were powered by gasoline engines.</p>",

He replaces Sir Michael Rake, who has been on the board for eight years and played a role in ousting the chief executive, Antony Jenkins, in July. Rake\u2019s departure from the Barclays board was delayed by the hiatus over the chief executive and he will now leave at the end of December to focus on chairing Worldpay, the payments service floated on the stock market in October. Grimstone will arrive a month after Jenkins\u2019s replacement, Jes Staley, takes on the chief executive role, for which he is receiving up to \u00a38m a year and shares worth about \u00a32m to buy him out of bonuses at the US bank JP Morgan. Staley\u2019s appointment means that John McFarlane can revert to his role as chairman after he temporarily took over the day-to-day running of the bank. At the bank\u2019s annual meeting in April 2014, the fund management arm of Standard Life had led protests about the size of bonuses being paid out. Grimstone, who has spent much of his career at the financial firm Schroders, is also a non-executive director at the accountants Deloitte and the lead non-executive at the Ministry of Defence. He is also an adviser to the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, one of the largest commercial banks in Abu Dhabi. He intends to remain chairman of Standard Life. Crawford Gillies, a Standard Life non-executive director, already sits on the Barclays board although he is leaving the insurer next year.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "<p>Not all IPOs are going according to plan for the investment bank </p>", 
      "body": "<p>Goldman Sachs prides itself on its investment banking business, <a href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/investment-banking/\">saying on its website</a> that it \u201caspires to be the leading trusted adviser and financier\u201d to its clients. </p> <p>The US company is widely considered the most ruthless operator among the leading global investment banks \u2013 an ultra-competitive field in itself.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So there is always interest when deals that Goldman Sachs has been working on don\u2019t go according to plan, as appears to have been the case over the past few weeks in a number of European stock market flotations.</p> <p>The latest came on Friday night when the $3bn (\u00a32bn) flotation of the German home delivery food business HelloFresh by Goldman Sachs and three other investment banks <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-06/rocket-internet-s-hellofresh-food-unit-said-to-postpone-ipo\">was postponed</a>, as uncertain market conditions continued to play havoc with deals that might have got over the line in better times.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This follows another three companies advised by banks including Goldman Sachs who saw their shares fall on the first day of trading in the last few weeks. Flotations have become trickier to get right following the volatility in China\u2019s stock market. Such has been the nervousness in European markets that around half of all flotations have been withdrawn since the start of September.</p> <p>Flotations \u2013 or initial public offerings (IPOs) \u2013 involve private companies, often part- or near fully owned by private equity groups or funds, coming to the stock market to issue new shares so as to raise money and become publicly listed. </p> <p>The companies depend on the likes of Goldman Sachs to determine a valuation of their equity and to sell that investment around the world to their clients or other potential purchasers, namely investing institutions, a mixture of pension funds, insurers and hedge funds. Several investment banks are often involved in underwriting and marketing individual IPOs, with one or more taking the lead role.</p> <p>If the valuation they plump for is too low, the owners of the business can feel cheated, as some UK taxpayers\u200e did when the government sold the first tranche of shares in Royal Mail (a deal that Goldman Sachs and two other banks were involved in). <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In that case, unions and others called on fees to the banks who advised the government on the price <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/20/royal-mail-sale-valuation-debacle-union\">to be withheld</a> amid claims that the UK taxpayer had lost hundreds of millions of pounds on the sale. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There are no hard and fast rules but broadly speaking most bankers in the IPO sector say they aim to issue shares which trade gently upwards on their first day of trading, to give the buyers the short-term boost they expect, and then to trade steadily upward thereafter.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Goldman Sachs raised some eyebrows for not following this path at last month\u2019s <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/10/12/uk-hastings-group-ipo-idUKKCN0S60MM20151012\">London flotation of Hastings Group</a>, a car insurer founded by the maverick entrepreneur Neil Utley.</p> <p>In this case, Goldman Sachs was on both sides of the deal. One of its private equity funds owned a 50% stake in Hastings and was eyeing a sizeable return on its \u00a3350m investment, which it had made only two years before. A Goldman team of investment banking advisers as well as a team from Credit Suisse and Peel Hunt <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/08/motor-insurer-hastings-relaunches-flotation-at-a-cheaper-price\">advised Hastings</a> on how to sell its shares to new investors.</p> <p>After the usual series of investor meetings, which took place against the background of gently deteriorating market conditions\u200e, a price range was launched at 180-220p a share. Ultimately this proved too high, even at the lower end, to attract enough demand.</p> <p>The issue was very unusually relaunched at the end of the marketing process at below the price range in an effort to get the deal away. But even after the shares\u200e were issued at 170p, Hastings has struggled so far to be accepted by the stock market. After nearly a month, the shares were trading at about 160p on Monday, still below the issue price.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A fortnight later, also in London, Goldman advised on the flotation of Equiniti, the share registrar company. Equiniti\u2019s stock was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/26/equiniti-attracts-investors-support-upcoming-ipo\">priced at the bottom end of its 165-200p range </a>but even then was hit by a large hedge fund seller that made a large stock disposal minutes after the shares started trading. Shares traded down on the first day of dealings from the issue price of 165p to around 157.5p, although by Monday they had risen to about 170p.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The bank was also advising on the French flotation of an online women\u2019s discount fashion chain, Showroomprive.com, whose shares <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/30/showroomprive-ipo-idUSL8N12U2BR20151030#SUqY0sq5e31UhqQW.97\">dropped from \u20ac19.50 to \u20ac17.44 on the first day\u2019s trading in Paris</a>. The shares have recovered gently since then and are now just below the issue price at \u20ac19.30.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>No one would say these three examples are anything more than a minor embarrassment for Goldman. They\u2019re nowhere near the scale of some past IPO disasters \u2013 for instance, shares in Sports Direct, which was floated by Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, traded at just 50% of their issue price months after the retailer\u2019s flotation in 2007.

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs prides itself on its investment banking business, saying on its website that it \u201caspires to be the leading trusted adviser and financier\u201d to its clients. The US company is widely considered the most ruthless operator among the leading global investment banks \u2013 an ultra-competitive field in itself. So there is always interest when deals that Goldman Sachs has been working on don\u2019t go according to plan, as appears to have been the case over the past few weeks in a number of European stock market flotations. The latest came on Friday night when the $3bn (\u00a32bn) flotation of the German home delivery food business HelloFresh by Goldman Sachs and three other investment banks was postponed, as uncertain market conditions continued to play havoc with deals that might have got over the line in better times. This follows another three companies advised by banks including Goldman Sachs who saw their shares fall on the first day of trading in the last few weeks. Flotations have become trickier to get right following the volatility in China\u2019s stock market. Such has been the nervousness in European markets that around half of all flotations have been withdrawn since the start of September. Flotations \u2013 or initial public offerings (IPOs) \u2013 involve private companies, often part- or near fully owned by private equity groups or funds, coming to the stock market to issue new shares so as to raise money and become publicly listed. The companies depend on the likes of Goldman Sachs to determine a valuation of their equity and to sell that investment around the world to their clients or other potential purchasers, namely investing institutions, a mixture of pension funds, insurers and hedge funds. Several investment banks are often involved in underwriting and marketing individual IPOs, with one or more taking the lead role. If the valuation they plump for is too low, the owners of the business can feel cheated, as some UK taxpayers\u200e did when the government sold the first tranche of shares in Royal Mail (a deal that Goldman Sachs and two other banks were involved in). In that case, unions and others called on fees to the banks who advised the government on the price to be withheld amid claims that the UK taxpayer had lost hundreds of millions of pounds on the sale. There are no hard and fast rules but broadly speaking most bankers in the IPO sector say they aim to issue shares which trade gently upwards on their first day of trading, to give the buyers the short-term boost they expect, and then to trade steadily upward thereafter. Goldman Sachs raised some eyebrows for not following this path at last month\u2019s London flotation of Hastings Group, a car insurer founded by the maverick entrepreneur Neil Utley. In this case, Goldman Sachs was on both sides of the deal. One of its private equity funds owned a 50% stake in Hastings and was eyeing a sizeable return on its \u00a3350m investment, which it had made only two years before. A Goldman team of investment banking advisers as well as a team from Credit Suisse and Peel Hunt advised Hastings on how to sell its shares to new investors. After the usual series of investor meetings, which took place against the background of gently deteriorating market conditions\u200e, a price range was launched at 180-220p a share. Ultimately this proved too high, even at the lower end, to attract enough demand. The issue was very unusually relaunched at the end of the marketing process at below the price range in an effort to get the deal away. But even after the shares\u200e were issued at 170p, Hastings has struggled so far to be accepted by the stock market. After nearly a month, the shares were trading at about 160p on Monday, still below the issue price. A fortnight later, also in London, Goldman advised on the flotation of Equiniti, the share registrar company. Equiniti\u2019s stock was priced at the bottom end of its 165-200p range but even then was hit by a large hedge fund seller that made a large stock disposal minutes after the shares started trading. Shares traded down on the first day of dealings from the issue price of 165p to around 157.5p, although by Monday they had risen to about 170p. The bank was also advising on the French flotation of an online women\u2019s discount fashion chain, Showroomprive.com, whose shares dropped from \u20ac19.50 to \u20ac17.44 on the first day\u2019s trading in Paris. The shares have recovered gently since then and are now just below the issue price at \u20ac19.30. No one would say these three examples are anything more than a minor embarrassment for Goldman. They\u2019re nowhere near the scale of some past IPO disasters \u2013 for instance, shares in Sports Direct, which was floated by Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, traded at just 50% of their issue price months after the retailer\u2019s flotation in 2007. Goldman Sachs itself came in for extensive criticism after floating the online grocer Ocado in 2010. Its shares took six months to move above the issue price on flotation, amid much scepticism about the \u00a31bn value attributed to the then loss-making group. Goldman Sachs\u2019 supporters argue that against an increasingly nervous market backdrop, weighed down by concerns over economic slowdown in China and fears of rising interest rates, it managed to get all three companies over the line. Since September, a total of 15 planned flotations have been pulled across Europe, including Shield Therapeutics and Deezer, the French rival to Spotify. A further four deals, including Hastings, have had their deals repriced at the lower end of expectations, according to data from Dealogic. Goldman Sachs has also recently advised on deals that have gone extremely well, such as Worldpay, the \u00a34bn-plus payments processing group whose shares are now 18% ahead of the issue price at the time of last month\u2019s float, and McCarthy &amp; Stone, the retirement property group, whose shares began trading above their issue price on Friday. \u201cI think you have to look at things in the context of the current challenging IPO market,\u201d said Dan Martin, who heads Goldman\u2019s European equity syndicate. \u201cThe three IPOs in question all had difficult starts but are recovering, with Equiniti and Showroomprive close to or above issue price.\u201d Goldman says its performance on IPOs that have come to the market since early September has been better than the average, despite the experience of the trio in question, with shares in all the companies it has listed up by an average of 7%, compared with an average of 6% for the market as a whole. In a still jittery market for new-issue companies, investment bankers will be squarely focused on the performance of the next Goldman Sachs deal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pity Wall Street\u2019s bankers. Their year-end bonuses are expected to fall by 5 to 10% this year \u2013 the first drop since 2011, according to a survey released on Monday. But before you reach for the tissues, realise the average bonus (on top of salary) paid to New York\u2019s 167,800 bankers last year was $172,860. The average US household income last year was $53,657, according to the US Census. An annual study of Wall Street pay predicts that most bankers will suffer at least a 5% decline in their year-end bonuses, with some sections of the industry suffering falls of as much as 20%. It is the first time that bonuses have fallen in four years, and is caused by falling profits at many of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, the consultancy which conducts the survey, said 2015 had been a \u201cdisappointment\u201d and \u201cstressful year\u201d. And he warned bankers, who are still waiting for their pay to rebound to pre-financial crisis levels, that he doesn\u2019t expect their pay to recover for at least another three to five years. \u201cGiven the up and down year Wall Street is experiencing this year, smaller year-end incentives across the industry should come as no surprise,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe asset management sector in particular is facing strong headwinds, and after several robust years experienced a change in fortune. Investment and commercial banks are struggling through another uneven year with overall year-end incentives to be mostly down with a few exceptions.\u201d Those working in fixed-income \u2013 which before the 2008 financial crisis was the most reliable engine of Wall Street profits \u2013 are expected to suffer the biggest decline in their bonuses, with a drop of between 10 and 20%. Hedge fund managers are set to be the next-worst hit, with bonuses down 5 to 15% or more, according to Johnson\u2019s survey, which is based on data from Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms. The only bankers expected to receive higher bonuses this year are investment bankers, who have benefited from the recent boom in mergers and acquisitions. Their average bonuses are expected to come in 15 to 20% higher thanks to a 60% increase in US M&amp;A activity to $988bn in the first half of 2015 \u2013 the strongest first six months of the year since records began in 1980. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan, was the best-paid banking boss last year, collecting $27.6m, including a $7.4m cash bonus, according to research firm Equilar. The bosses of the world\u2019s 15 biggest banks took home an average of $14.5m in 2014, a 17% increase on 2013.",

      "body": "<p>Pity Wall Street\u2019s bankers. Their year-end bonuses are expected to fall by 5 to 10% this year \u2013 the first drop since 2011, according to a survey released on Monday. But before you reach for the tissues, realise the average bonus (on top of salary) paid to New York\u2019s 167,800 bankers last year was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/mar15/031115.htm\">$172,860</a>. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.pdf\">average US household income</a> last year was $53,657, according to the US Census.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/wall-street-year-end-incentive-awards-be-modestly-lower-2015-johnson-associates-analysis-2071626.htm\">An annual study of Wall Street pay</a> predicts that most bankers will suffer at least a 5% decline in their year-end bonuses, with some sections of the industry suffering falls of as much as 20%. It is the first time that bonuses have fallen in four years, and is caused by falling profits at many of Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. </p> <p>Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, the consultancy which conducts the survey, said 2015 had been a \u201cdisappointment\u201d and \u201cstressful year\u201d. And he warned bankers, who are still waiting for their pay to rebound to pre-financial crisis levels, that he doesn\u2019t expect their pay to recover for at least another three to five years. </p> <p>\u201cGiven the up and down year Wall Street is experiencing this year, smaller year-end incentives across the industry should come as no surprise,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe asset management sector in particular is facing strong headwinds, and after several robust years experienced a change in fortune. Investment and commercial banks are struggling through another uneven year with overall year-end incentives to be mostly down with a few exceptions.\u201d</p> <p>Those working in fixed-income \u2013 which before the 2008 financial crisis was the most reliable engine of Wall Street profits \u2013 are expected to suffer the biggest decline in their bonuses, with a drop of between 10 and 20%. Hedge fund managers are set to be the next-worst hit, with bonuses down 5 to 15% or more, according to Johnson\u2019s survey, which is based on data from Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms. </p> <p>The only bankers expected to receive higher bonuses this year are investment bankers, who have benefited from the recent boom in mergers and acquisitions. Their average bonuses are expected to come in 15 to 20% higher thanks to a 60% increase in US M&amp;A activity to $988bn in the first half of 2015 \u2013 the strongest first six months of the year since records began in 1980. </p> <p>Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan, was the best-paid banking boss last year, collecting $27.6m, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/06/jp-morgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-bonus\">including a $7.4m cash bonus</a>, according to research firm Equilar. The bosses of the world\u2019s 15 biggest banks took home an average of $14.5m in 2014, a 17% increase on 2013. </p>",

Visitors to the restaurant in Jenner in California\u2019s Sonoma County are instead directed to a table laden with food \u2013 pelmeni, borscht and other Russian specialties. When they ask about prices, the response is always the same: there are no prices. Polina Krasikova and Tatiana Ginzburg\u2019s Russian eatery is an experiment in donation-based restauranteering, one the pair hope will result in a different kind of connection with customers than what is typically made through the exchange of money for products. \u201cWhen people find out there are no prices, there are a range of reactions. Most are shocked and some actually yell at us,\u201d said Krasikova, 39, who moved from St Petersburg to the US to start the venture. \u201cJust our forcing the person to think about it makes a lot of people uncomfortable. It becomes about the self worth they associate with money.\u201d The seed of the idea for the restaurant was planted when Krasikova and Ginzburg went to Burning Man, the counterculture festival held in Nevada\u2019s Black Rock Desert, where a gifting economy is used in place of money. After they left the festival, the friends travelled around the country for a few weeks. When they arrived at the tiny town of Jenner, on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, what they had experienced at Burning Man manifested in a business idea. \u201cThe concept [of the restaurant] is you offer [the patrons] food and tea and in return, it\u2019s the beginning of giving them the attention and finding out about who they are,\u201d said Ginzburg, who is 44 and works as a psychologist. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a connection.\u201d The women, both of whom now split their time between Russia and the US, chose the location for the restaurant because it is on the Russian River, where it meets the Pacific Ocean. A picturesque spot 10 miles from Fort Ross, a former Russian settlement built in the early 1800s by fur trappers. \u201cIt (the area) was incredibly beautiful and reminded me of an old Russian town,\u201d Ginzburg said. \u201cIn our work, we often talk about self-actualization, but here was our chance to take the next step. We decided to jump on it.\u201d In recent years, a number of sliding scale or donation-based businesses have opened, including Karma Kitchen, where diners pay nothing for their own meal but only for the meal of future visitors, also known as \u201cpaying it forward\u201d. The mobile project \u2013 it relies on an existing restaurant to host them \u2013 launched in Berkeley in 2007 and today can be found in 20 cities around the world including Chicago, Detroit and London. Yoga to the People has studios across the US, offering donation-based classes. In 210, Panera Bread launched Panera Cares cafes, where customers are given suggested prices, but can pay whatever they like. According to the company, about 60% of customers leave the suggested donation, about 20% leave more and another 15-20% leave less or nothing, according to the company\u2019s website. However, these companies represent a tiny fraction of businesses in the US, where most restaurants survive by a very slim profit margin. \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re running a business and you have to meet your minimal costs,\u201d Kellie McElhaney, a professor at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, said. \u201cLots of businesses look at profit and their social mission as being at odds with each other, when they have to do both in order to be sustainable.\u201d Russian House #1 may be helped by the fact that it\u2019s located in a small community where many residents support \u201cbuying local\u201d and businesses are perceived as having a higher social mission, McElhaney added. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a risk, but what they\u2019re doing is taking a price tag off a thing and instead saying this cafe is an experience,\u201d McElhaney said. \u201cAnd in doing so, they\u2019re trying to create a sense of community and dialogue in a world where we\u2019ve lost a lot of that.\u201d Krasikova and Ginzburg said that donations cover their food costs, but admitted they are relying on savings for other expenses, such as rent and the remodeling they had to do prior to opening. They said they are counting on the generosity and participation of their many supporters for the success of the cafe. On the weekends, guests can take part in philosophy workshops.These are mostly held in Russian, but are occasionally attended by Americans who are drawn by the opportunity to discuss such themes in a group setting. \u201cI think Russian culture is very interested in exploring ideas and asking the hard questions and that\u2019s what they are doing here,\u201d said Jane Honeycutt, a local yoga instructor. Honeycutt often brings fruit from her orchard to share with the restaurant, one of a number of locals who have given everything from organic vegetables to their skills in exchange for plates of food. One man fixed a piano that now sits in the corner of the restaurant and another decided to stay with the group and work in the kitchen in exchange for companionship and conversation. \u201cSharing, helping, giving ... what they are doing is trying to shift consciousness,\u201d Honeycutt said. \u201cI think the world is ready for this kind of idea.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Argos has apologised after customers trying to take up pre-Christmas discounts complained that the retailer\u2019s website was out of action for much of Sunday. The catalogue store business was offering three toys for the price of two in an attempt to lure Christmas shoppers before Black Friday \u2013 the frenzied discount day scheduled for 27 November. The toy offer runs until Tuesday and will be followed by two further Fridays of offers before Black Friday. The website glitch was badly timed for Argos, coming before the crucial Christmas trading period and as it tries to reinvent itself as a mainly digital business. Argos has spent millions of pounds on a multimedia advertising campaign and taken on hundreds more vans as it tries to phase out in-store laminated catalogues and stubby pencils in favour of sales on tablets and smartphones. Its parent, Home Retail Group, issued a profit warning last month, caused by poor trading and the cost of a new same-day delivery service to combat Amazon. Argos customers on social media protested that they were unable to make purchases on Sunday because the website was not working. Online shoppers found themselves in a queue to view the site with a \u201ccrowd control\u201d timer counting down to when they would be able to use the site. Customers were also presented with red traffic lights refusing admittance to the site. Argos apologised for what it called temporary service issues during Sunday afternoon. It did not say how long the problems lasted or give a reason. But some shoppers reported problems starting on Saturday night. Argos said: \u201cWe have identified and fixed the issue and our site is now up and running. We apologise to any customer who has tried to contact us unsuccessfully and we are working to respond to all inquiries as soon as we can. Customers have been able to transact in our national store network and take advantage of our current offers, including three for two on toys.\u201d Argos warned last month that heavy shopping around Black Friday made Christmas trading highly unpredictable. John Walden, Home Retail\u2019s chief executive, said no retailer could predict how trading would play out after Black Friday. There was chaos in many shops last year as fights broke out between shoppers at Asda and Tesco stores and a number of retailers\u2019 websites struggled to cope with high volumes. For some stores, a Black Friday sales surge was followed by a slump in trade, leading to heavy discounting as Christmas approached. Asda has scaled back its Black Friday promotions this year and John Lewis\u2019s boss, Andy Street, has said retailers should rein in discounts to prevent Black Friday distorting Christmas trading, though he expects business on the day to be 20% higher than last year.",

But its shares have added 72p to \u00a310.04 as it said overall second half revenue would be similar to the 2% decline seen in the first six months, and it was keeping its guidance of full year profits of between \u00a3250m and \u00a3270m. It said revenues in its rental business was down 1%, with a weak oil and gas sector partly offset by stronger growth in other areas such as petrochemical and refining. Power solutions saw revenues fall 11% but within this, industrial was up 12% helped by a successful contract for the European Games in Baku. Traders said there was an element of short covering in the share price rise, given a significant level of shorting by hedge funds. Analysts were not overly enthused. RBC said: We have flattish profits factored in for next year, with a reduction in underlying trading offset by cost savings. However, we do continue to see some risks to forecasts from a weaker resources sector, tough pricing and potentially higher churn given 2016 rebids.

      "bodyText": "A sharp slowdown in global trade on the back of China\u2019s troubles poses a threat to economic growth and calls for richer countries to step up investment while keeping monetary policy loose, a leading thinktank has warned. In its twice-yearly outlook, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) highlighted risks from emerging markets and weak trade. The thinktank cut its forecast for global economic growth to 2.9% in 2015 and 3.3% in 2016, down from 3.0% and 3.6%, respectively, pencilled in at an interim update in September. Presenting the outlook in Paris, OECD secretary general Angel Gurr\u00eda said: \u201cThe slowdown in global trade and the continuing weakness in investment are deeply concerning. Robust trade and investment and stronger global growth should go hand in hand.\u201d The thinktank edged up its forecast for economic growth in the group of 34 OECD countries this year to 2.0% from 1.9% in June\u2019s outlook, when it had noted a sharp dip in US growth at the opening of 2015. For 2016, it has cut the forecast for OECD countries\u2019 growth to 2.2% from 2.5%. The OECD left its forecasts for the UK little changed with growth of 2.4% this year and next, compared with a forecast for 2016 growth of 2.3% made in June. The US economy, the world\u2019s biggest, is now recorded as growing 2.4% this year and 2.5% in 2016, compared with June\u2019s forecasts of 2.0% and 2.8%. The group repeated earlier recommendations that governments increase investment to help support growth. Such spending did not have to come at the expense of debt reduction given the likely boost to growth, it added. \u201cOn the fiscal side, collective action to increase public investment would increase growth sufficiently to reduce debt-to-GDP ratios, as long as investment projects are of high quality and supported by good structural policies. These policy actions would make European growth a driver of the global economy,\u201d the latest outlook said. Policymakers and economists have been divided over whether cutting spending will eventually bring down countries\u2019 debt piles or in fact prove counter-productive because it dents economic growth. Trades union group TUC said that with borrowing costs at a record low, Osborne should heed the OECD\u2019s advice about investment and put more money into building homes and modernising the UK\u2019s energy and transport networks. \u201cInvesting in infrastructure is a no brainer. It will pay for itself in the long-run by stimulating growth and creating the economic conditions that businesses need to thrive,\u201d said TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cBy contrast, limiting investment and imposing severe cuts on vital public services will leave us less able to meet the economic challenges of the future and hold back our recovery at a time of global financial uncertainty.\u201d In the meantime, with global trade weak the OECD raised the spectre of recession. Catherine Mann, OECD chief economist said: \u201cGlobal trade, which was already growing relatively slowly over the past few years, appears to have stagnated and even declined since late 2014. This is deeply concerning. Robust trade and global growth go hand in hand.\u201d \u201cThe growth rates of global trade observed so far in 2015 have, in the past, been associated with global recession.\u201d She said sluggish trade growth in 2012 and 2013 appeared to have centred on advanced countries. \u201cIn 2015, by contrast, weak global trade growth centers on emerging markets. Developments in China appear to be at the heart of this.\u201d OECD forecasts Mann also commented on the refugee crisis and echoed other economists in noting likely benefits to European countries from immigration. \u201cA collective approach to the recent surge in asylum-seekers arriving in the EU would help to reduce political tensions. Given the right policies, asylum-seekers need not impose an unmanageable economic burden. Indeed, if the refugees who stay are rapidly integrated into European society, they are likely to benefit the host countries,\u201d she said. On the UK, the OECD said economic growth was projected to \u201ccontinue at a robust pace over the coming two years, driven by domestic demand.\u201d \u201cThis projection assumes the Bank of England will begin to raise its policy rate in early 2016, and then raise it gradually through 2017 to ward off excess demand pressures,\u201d it noted. Although a new round of spending cuts will be announced by chancellor George Osborne later this month, the thinktank appeared to welcome his previous easing in the pace of government austerity measures. \u201cThe pace of fiscal consolidation has appropriately been smoothed to around 1% of GDP per year and now involves smaller reductions in spending on public services than earlier planned.\u201d",

The US economy, the world\u2019s biggest, is now recorded as growing 2.4% this year and 2.5% in 2016, compared with June\u2019s forecasts of 2.0% and 2.8%.</p> <p>The group repeated earlier recommendations that governments increase investment to help support growth. Such spending did not have to come at the expense of debt reduction given the likely boost to growth, it added.</p> <p>\u201cOn the fiscal side, collective action to increase public investment would increase growth sufficiently to reduce debt-to-GDP ratios, as long as investment projects are of high quality and supported by good structural policies. These policy actions would make European growth a driver of the global economy,\u201d the latest outlook said.</p> <p>Policymakers and economists have been divided over whether cutting spending will eventually bring down countries\u2019 debt piles or in fact prove counter-productive because it dents economic growth.</p> <p>Trades union group TUC said that with borrowing costs at a record low, Osborne should heed the OECD\u2019s advice about investment and put more money into building homes and modernising the UK\u2019s energy and transport networks.<br></p> <p>\u201cInvesting in infrastructure is a no brainer. It will pay for itself in the long-run by stimulating growth and creating the economic conditions that businesses need to thrive,\u201d said TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady.</p> <p>\u201cBy contrast, limiting investment and imposing severe cuts on vital public services will leave us less able to meet the economic challenges of the future and hold back our recovery at a time of global financial uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, with global trade weak the OECD raised the spectre of recession.<br> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/oecd_forecasts/giv-31114TRtHCwZ2THiH/\" data-alt=\"real GDP\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/oecd_forecasts/giv-31114TRtHCwZ2THiH/\">real GDP</a> </figure>  <p>Catherine Mann, OECD chief economist said: \u201cGlobal trade, which was already growing relatively slowly over the past few years, appears to have stagnated and even declined since late 2014. This is deeply concerning. Robust trade and global growth go hand in hand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe growth rates of global trade observed so far in 2015 have, in the past, been associated with global recession.\u201d </p> <p>She said sluggish trade growth in 2012 and 2013 appeared to have centred on advanced countries.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2015, by contrast, weak global trade growth centers on emerging markets. Developments in China appear to be at the heart of this.\u201d</p> <h2>OECD forecasts<br></h2> <p>Mann also commented on the refugee crisis and echoed other economists in noting likely benefits to European countries from immigration.<br> </p> <p>\u201cA collective approach to the recent surge in asylum-seekers arriving in the EU would help to reduce political tensions. Given the right policies, asylum-seekers need not impose an unmanageable economic burden. Indeed, if the refugees who stay are rapidly integrated into European society, they are likely to benefit the host countries,\u201d she said. </p> <p>On the UK, the OECD said economic growth was projected to \u201ccontinue at a robust pace over the coming two years, driven by domestic demand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis projection assumes the Bank of England will begin to raise its policy rate in early 2016, and then raise it gradually through 2017 to ward off excess demand pressures,\u201d it noted. </p> <p>Although a new round of spending cuts will be announced by chancellor George Osborne later this month, the thinktank appeared to welcome his previous easing in the pace of government austerity measures.</p> <p>\u201cThe pace of fiscal consolidation has appropriately been smoothed to around 1% of GDP per year and now involves smaller reductions in spending on public services than earlier planned.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When David Cameron invited one of the world\u2019s most powerful men for a swift pint last month, he was hoping to seal a \u201cgolden era\u201d of relations between London and Beijing. But Xi Jinping\u2019s trip to the prime minister\u2019s local pub had another unexpected consequence: it transformed China\u2019s red emperor into an unlikely poster boy for British brewery Greene King. Sales of Greene King IPA, a pint of which Xi was pictured sipping during his recent visit to The Plough at Cadsden pub in Buckinghamshire, have reportedly soared in China following last month\u2019s state visit to Britain. \u201cIt has just gone berserk. It\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Peter Bloxham, a Beijing-based British businessman who imports Greene King beers into China. \u201cWithin two days of the great bar scene \u2026 people from all over China were ringing: agents, restaurants, bars, hotels. They wanted this beer.\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019t pay for the promotion. It would cost you a fortune,\u201d added Bloxham, who said orders were now coming in \u201cfrom north, south, east and west.\u201d \u201cWe are now completely out of stock in our warehouse in Beijing of everything to do with Greene King,\u201d he said. Xi\u2019s pub trip was a major coup for Communist party spin doctors who have been trying to portray China\u2019s leader as an approachable man of the people. But it has also proved a boon for Chinese bars. In recent weeks at least one Beijing watering hole has started using images of the Xi-Cameron drinking session to draw in customers. \u201cCome and drink beer here. We have the same Greene King beer that Xi Dada drank,\u201d reads its sign, using the president\u2019s nickname, which means Uncle or Big Daddy Xi. Nor is the boom limited to China\u2019s political capital. Newspapers from as far afield as Xinjiang, a sprawling desert region more than 2,000 miles west of Beijing, have reported a spike in the beer\u2019s consumption. Xi\u2019s pint immediately ignited the \u201cpassion and curiosity\u201d of drinkers in Xinjiang, according to Tianshan Net, a government-run news website. \u201cBefore, we were selling about 100 litres each day. Now we can sell as much as 200 or 300 litres,\u201d the landlord of one pub in Urumqi, Xinjiang\u2019s capital, was quoted as saying. \u201cBring me another glass of IPA beer \u2013 the one that Big Daddy Xi drank!\u201d a customer was heard demanding, according to the website\u2019s correspondent. Xinjiang beer aficionados said the IPA\u2019s \u201cfloral aftertaste\u201d meant it compared favourably with the local lager, Dawusu. \u201cThe first bite is a little bitter but it gets better and tastes a bit like the smell of flower,\u201d Tianshan Net reported. The city of Tianjin, about 100 miles south-east of Beijing, has also been caught up in the craze. Alcohol retailers there have been swamped with requests for Greene King, the Tianjin Daily reported. \u201cMy stocks are nearly all gone,\u201d said one local businesswoman, noting that some customers had even offered to pay twice the normal price. China\u2019s infatuation with Greene King could prove lucrative for the Suffolk-based brewery, which was founded in 1799 and now owns 1,600 pubs. China is the world\u2019s leading producer and consumer of beer, with some expecting annual consumption to hit 61bn litres by 2016. Bloxham, who is from Shropshire but has lived in Beijing since 2000, said his company, PFB Associates, normally imported 6,000 bottles of Greene King IPA into China each month. To keep up with demand he plans to bring in at least 80,000 bottles next month. A single Chinese buyer recently commissioned a 20ft container of the beer, holding about 12,000 bottles. \u201cThey are desperate for it,\u201d Bloxham said. A Greene King spokeswoman said the company\u2019s Suffolk brewery already had some Chinese tourists among its visitors, and was now expecting more. She said: \u201cWe are thrilled that more people in China are enjoying Greene King beers following President Xi Jinping\u2019s recent visit to the UK. We are working hard with our distribution partners in China to meet the current demand, by increasing shipments out to China.\u201d Steve Hollings, who has owned and run The Plough with his wife Sharon for almost 17 years, said the Greene King IPA, which he always stocks alongside some local ales, was the best-selling beer at the pub. Cameron, whose official country retreat, Chequers, is nearby visits regularly with his wife, Hollings said. \u201cWhen they come here it\u2019s just Mr and Mrs Cameron, not the prime minister. He\u2019s not working. You couldn\u2019t wish to meet a nicer person.\u201d The IPA is the prime minister\u2019s pint of choice, Hollings said, which is why Xi also tried it: \u201cHe absolutely loved it, really, really enjoyed it. The president wanted another one, but he was told they didn\u2019t have time \u2013 they were on their way to Chequers for a big banquet.\u201d Additional reporting by Luna Lin",

      "bodyText": "Goals Soccer Centres has warned that annual profit will miss forecasts after bookings at its five-a-side football venues failed to recover from a summer slump caused by players holidaying overseas. Goals said in September that cancelled bookings had increased because players were taking advantage of the strong pound to take holidays abroad, leaving league and casual teams without enough people. In response, Goals increased its marketing efforts to lure teams that had taken a break over the summer and new teams to its centres. It also introduced incentives to keep teams coming back. The marketing push was less successful than expected as the holiday trend continued during September and October, prompting Goals to cut its guidance for annual pre-tax profit to between \u00a38.2m and \u00a38.6m. It reduced the guidance, based on normal weather, from a range of \u00a39.3m to \u00a39.8m published in September. Pre-tax profit last year was \u00a310.6m, indicating profit is likely to fall by about 20% this year. Before September, analysts had expected 2015 profit of \u00a310.6m. The company\u2019s shares dropped 12% to 135p after the profit warning. They have fallen more than 40% since approaching a record high at the end of February when they reached 238.5p. In a trading update, the company said: \u201cTrading in the UK business over the summer holiday period had been challenging. Whilst we have made progress since 9 September, delivering week-on-week sales improvements, the speed of this recovery has not been at the level anticipated.\u201d Goals, based in East Kilbride, operates 46 centres in the UK, each typically featuring at least nine floodlit outdoor five-a-side pitches. It also has a centre in Los Angeles. The company aims to capitalise on the increasing popularity of five-a-side, which it says is a fast-growing sport with relatively undeveloped facilities. The company said the number of games are now back to the same level as last year, suggesting the drop-off in demand was temporary.",

It reduced the guidance, based on normal weather, from a range of \u00a39.3m to \u00a39.8m published in September.</p> <p>Pre-tax profit last year was \u00a310.6m, indicating profit is likely to fall by about 20% this year. Before September, analysts had expected 2015 profit of \u00a310.6m.</p> <p>The company\u2019s shares dropped 12% to 135p after the profit warning. They have fallen more than 40% since approaching a record high at the end of February when they reached 238.5p.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/goals-soccer-centres/rns/trading-statement/201511090700089362E/\">trading update</a>, the company said: \u201cTrading in the UK business over the summer holiday period had been challenging. Whilst we have made progress since 9 September, delivering week-on-week sales improvements, the speed of this recovery has not been at the level anticipated.\u201d<br></p> <p>Goals, based in East Kilbride, operates 46 centres in the UK, each typically featuring at least nine floodlit outdoor five-a-side pitches. It also has a centre in Los Angeles. The company aims to capitalise on the increasing popularity of five-a-side, which it says is a fast-growing sport with relatively undeveloped facilities.</p> <p>The company said the number of games are now back to the same level as last year, suggesting the drop-off in demand was temporary.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leading UK shares are heading higher despite more weak Chinese data and a dip in Europe as worries about Greece\u2019s finances re-emerge. But InterContinental Hotels is a notable exception. It had been partly buoyed in recent weeks by takeover speculation, and a report late last week that it was looking at strategic options gave them another lift. But after the market closed on Friday, the company issued a formal denial that it was considering a sale or merger. So in the market\u2019s first chance to react to the statement, InterContinental\u2019s shares have dropped 110p or nearly 4% to \u00a326.64, making it the biggest faller in the leading index. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: It is not the first time that such speculation has arisen and then been denied, but with the firm trading around nineteen times earnings and possessing activist shareholders on its board, the story is likely to return in due course, providing further incentive for investors to book themselves in. Utility shares have fallen back after Exane BNP Paribas cut its rating on Severn Trent to underperform. Severn is down 44p at \u00a321.41, while United Utilities has slipped 18.5p to 939p after a downgrade from Societe General. SocGen said: We downgrade our rating from buy to hold as: i) the recent strong share price performance (up 14% relative to FTSE 100 since August) has driven the share price marginally above our 940p fair value; and ii) the strong share price performance has been at odds with the recent rise in real bond yields. But Standard Chartered has recovered 16.6p to 631.3p after its recent falls, with Nomura suggesting the shares had been oversold. The bank kept its neutral rating although it cut its target price from 795p to 640p. Nomura said: As banks go through macro-economic slowdowns and credit cycles, there are three points of inflection to buy the stock. With the rights issues already announced by Standard Chartered, the first of these three points, dilution risk point, will soon be past us, assuming no further recapitalisations are required. We still have to get past the inflection points when Asian economies bottom (where China drives sentiment) and when the credit cycle turns (when non-performing loans start falling). With Nomura expecting China GDP of 5.8% in 2016, falling to 5.6% in 2017 (consensus is at 6.5% for 2016 and 6.2% for 2017), we appear to be some time away from the latter two inflection points. The main reason to buy Standard here would be an expectation of a shallower cycle and an imminent inflection point in macro-economic developments, which we don\u2019t currently expect. Tactically, we see upside as the stock looks oversold in the near term. Despite Chinese trade data showing a 6.9% fall in exports, adding to the concern\u2019s about the world\u2019s second biggest economy, mining shares are edging higher. Glencore is up 2.85p at 118.7p while Rio Tinto has risen 51p to \u00a323.33. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 18.01 p0ints at 6371.84, with some traders saying the weak Chinese figures were outweighing the concerns about a rise in US interest rates in December. Stronger than expected US jobs figures on Friday seemed to suggest an increase before the end of the year was a foregone conclusion, but a slowdown in China may yet have an influence on the Federal Reserve. But European shares have been undermined by concerns that Greece had not made enough progress with its reforms to get its next bailout tranche at a Eurogroup meeting today. Elsewhere satellite communications group Inmarsat is up 1p to \u00a310.06 after news that Singapore Airlines would use its GX service for broadband connections on its long-haul fleet. There was also talk Inmarsat may also sign up British Airways owner International Airlines Group. Among the mid-caps Tullow Oil is benefitting from crude prices edging higher, as well as a note from Morgan Stanley raising its target price from 275p to 285p. There was also a boost from Maersk buying stakes in three of Africa Oil\u2019s Kenyan exploration licences. Tullow owns five licences in Kenya, and the Maersk move was seen as a positive one for the area. Stephane Foucaud, analyst at FirstEnergy Capital, said: This is a big vote of confidence on the quality and materiality of these assets that have been plagued by uncertainty on capital gain tax and routing of the export pipeline.",

      "bodyText": "The UK steel industry and unions have called on the business secretary to press for urgent action on cheap Chinese steel imports at a European Union summit about the crisis affecting the sector. Sajid Javid will travel to Brussels for a meeting with EU economy and industry ministers scheduled for 4.30pm local time. Javid pushed for the meeting to discuss the steel crisis after he was criticised for responding slowly to mounting job losses in the sector. Companies and workers are united in demanding emergency measures to save Britain\u2019s steel industry, with about one in six steelworkers threatened with losing their jobs. They want Javid to press for swift action to stop the alleged dumping of cheap Chinese steel in Europe. Britain\u2019s steel industry has been battered by falling prices, high energy costs, cheap imports and the strength of the pound, which has made exports expensive. The sector has been hit by the closure of the Redcar steel plant on Teesside with the loss of 2,200 jobs, Caparo industries going into administration and the mothballing of Tata Steel mills in Scunthorpe and Scotland with 1,200 redundancies. UK Steel, the industry\u2019s lobby group, said the latest figures showed Chinese dumping of reinforcing steel would make up more than half the UK steel market this year. The EU\u2019s bureaucracy makes it too slow to respond to such a deluge of imported steel, it said. In the EU, cases of dumping can take months to be accepted and investigated followed by another nine months before a provisional decision is taken, UK Steel said. By contrast, the US took weeks to introduce measures to combat Chinese dumping, it added. Gareth Stace. UK Steel\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe US and other countries have already moved to prevent cheap Chinese imports distorting their markets and now the EU must do the same and, do so quickly. The UK must seize the moment and encourage a rapid response in Brussels if we\u2019re to prevent large scale problems for steel makers spreading in Britain and across the continent.\u201d Workers from the UK, Belgium and France will demonstrate at a rally outside the meeting. Unions have accused Javid of a woefully inadequate response to the crisis and have criticised the government\u2019s reluctance to press the case against cheap Chinese imports when China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, visited the UK last month. Unions also want the government to help with energy costs and business rates and to ensure major infrastructure projects use British steel. Javid has said he wants to help but that he is constrained by European Union rules on providing state aid to business. Harish Patel, national officer at the Unite union, said: \u201cHiding behind the EU as an excuse to do nothing will not wash with the tens of thousands of workers whose livelihoods depend on steelmaking in the UK. \u201cThe business secretary needs to secure urgent action from the meeting to tackle the dumping of cheap Chinese steel and high energy costs. \u201cSajid Javid also needs to use the opportunity to learn from his counterparts in countries such as Germany and Italy and follow their lead in developing an industrial strategy with steel at its heart. A spokesman for Javid\u2019s department said: \u201cThe secretary of state requested Monday\u2019s meeting of the competitiveness council to put the difficulties felt by the steel industry both at home in the UK and across the continent high up on the European agenda.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Falling commodity prices and the aftermath of the Brazil dam disaster have combined to push shares in the mining giant BHP Billiton to a seven-year low, helping to drag the wider Australian market down sharply. BHP Billiton dropped 5.64% on the ASX to $21.42, its lowest since the midst of the global financial crisis as it announced it might cut its iron ore output in the wake of the disaster which has left up to two people dead and dozens still missing. With the market also weighed by the growing prospect of a rise in US interest rates, other mining stocks suffered. Rio Tinto dumped $1.80 at $49.00, and Fortescue Metals eased three cents to $2.20. The major banks were also down as the benchmark ASX/S&amp;P200 index ended the day down nearly 2% at 5,119.5 points. HC Securities senior client adviser Mark Lennox said better than expected US jobs figures on Friday had heightened expectations of a rise in US interest rates. That pushed up the US dollar, which pulled down the prices of commodities such as oil and gold. Lennox said resources stocks exposed to the strength of the US dollar were hit hard on Monday. \u201cAnything with gold and copper in particular seems to be taking the full force of the pain,\u201d Lennox said. He said slowing economic growth in China was also weighing upon commodity prices. On Sunday a report showed that in October China recorded its highest trade surplus on record, due to an 18.8% fall in imports. Analysts saw it as a further indication that the Chinese economy is weakening. BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie was scheduled to arrive in Brazil on Monday to see first-hand the impact of the collapse of the dam disaster and the recovery operation. Three days after the rupturing of two dams unleashed a massive flood of mud on nearby villages, authorities were still struggling to determine the cause of the disaster or even recover the bodies of as many as 28 people lost in the torrent. The disaster in the mineral-rich south-eastern state of Minas Gerais, directly north of Rio de Janeiro, has prompted a rescue and salvage operation involving about 500 people, many of whom are still searching with the help of dogs and special equipment for victims along the floodplain downstream from the dams.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of BHP Billiton will arrive in Brazil on Monday to see at first-hand the devastation wrought by the collapse of a dam at an iron ore mine co-owned by the company that has left at least two dead and dozens missing. Three days after the rupturing of two dams unleashed a massive flood of mud on nearby villages, authorities were still struggling to determine the cause of the disaster or even recover the bodies of as many as 28 people lost in the torrent. Amid mounting criticism by officials, environmentalists and residents of how the dams were allowed to collapse, BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie was due to meet with mine bosses and local authorities at the site of the disaster on Monday. The Anglo-Australian company, which co-owns mine operator Samarco in a joint venture with its Brazilian rival Vale, said on Monday that it was providing \u201call the assistance necessary\u201d. \u201cAt this time, there is no confirmation of the causes of the [dam collapse],\u201d BHP said in a statement. \u201cBHP Billiton has offered its full support to help the immediate rescue efforts and to assist with the investigation.\u201d BHP said its operation included a three-tiered dam complex containing mine tailings, or waste. Within this complex, the Fundao dam failed, and the downstream Santarem dam was affected. Samarco is monitoring the third dam, which is called Germano. Shares in the company, which is listed in London and Australia, fell by 3.5% on Monday on the ASX/S&amp;P200 benchmark index. The disaster in the mineral-rich south-eastern state of Minas Gerais, directly north of Rio de Janeiro, has prompted a rescue and salvage operation involving about 500 people, many of whom are still searching with the help of dogs and special equipment for victims along the floodplain downstream from the dams. Authorities late on Sunday recovered two more bodies of possible victims that if confirmed would raise the death toll so far to four. Of the 28 people listed as missing late Sunday, 13 were mine workers. The remainder were local villagers caught in the destruction, with flooding and mud spreading as far as 100km (60 miles) away. Those missing were unlikely to be found alive, the governor of Minas Gerais said on Sunday. Speaking at a news conference, Fernando Pimentel said it was still not known what triggered Thursday\u2019s failure of the dams, unleashing a massive flood of mud, water and debris which destroyed all but a handful of buildings in the village of Bento Rodrigues. The mud tide has continued to spread, causing flooding in other nearby towns, contaminating the Rio Dolce river and threatening the water supply of several cities in the neighbouring state of Espirito Santo. \u201cOne lost human life would be irreparable. Imagine 28,\u201d Pimentel was quoted as saying by the Rio de Janeiro newspaper O Globo. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster, a tragedy of great dimension.\u201d Pimentel also joined critics calling for a rethink of how regulation of the mining industry, one of Brazil\u2019s leading source of export revenue. \u201cWe have to learn the lessons of this accident,\u201d he told reporters after a flyover of the devastation on Sunday. \u201cObviously, this wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d he added, referring to the existing regulatory framework. Government leaders and residents also criticised what they say has been lax communication by Samarco. Vale, one of Brazil\u2019s biggest companies with a long history of operations in Minas Gerais, has referred all queries about the incident to Samarco. Local people whose homes were destroyed or damaged by sludge stained with mineral waste were especially critical of Samarco for the uncertainty they now face. Authorities said as many as 580 people are taking shelter in hotels or with family and friends. Samarco is paying for accommodations and relocation, but those affected complain that the company has given few answers about how long the displacements might last or how they might eventually repair or replace damaged homes. \u201cThey haven\u2019t said until when we can stay or where we\u2019ll go afterwards,\u201d said Gilberto Perreira da Silva, standing outside a hotel where he is being lodged in the old center of Mariana, the city closest to the mine. Da Silva\u2019s village was washed away by the waters. Cristiane Temporao, a Samarco employee tending to those at the hotel, asked for patience while the company determines the best course. \u201cWhen we settle on a plan it\u2019s got to be a good one,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "When talking of the budget, treasurer Scott Morrison has been quick to talk of a spending problem and just as quick to dismiss any talk of a revenue problem. Now, as he tries to suggest changes need to be made to the taxation system, he conversely has neglected to talk about government spending. His one-side-only approach to the budget will need to end if he wants to propose a new tax system that keeps the system fair and which voters will accept. Since Malcolm Turnbull assumed the office of prime minister and Morrison became treasurer, the tax debate has turned such that it has become almost a fait accompli that the GST will either be raised or broadened. And why should it be raised? Well, the prime minister has told us it is all about efficiency \u2013 a GST, he argues, is an efficient tax. And so it is, but we shouldn\u2019t get too excited about the benefits the added efficiency will bring. In April this year, the Treasury produced a working paper which looked at the efficiency of various taxes. Stamp duties came in as the worst tax \u2013 costing around 70 cents in economic output per $1 raised. By contrast, a flat rate income tax cost 21 cents per $1 of tax raised and the ever efficient GST cost just 19 cents. The Treasury only modelled a flat income tax and not a progressive one such as we have, so you could add a cent or two onto the cost, but still the difference between the cost of the income tax and the GST is pretty slight. And certainly the difference is not enough to be a very big selling point \u2013 especially since the efficiency of a GST overall will be reduced because to combat its regressive nature, welfare will have to be increased. As Michael Potter from the Centre for Independent Studies noted last week, such welfare payments would likely serve to further reduce the efficiency of raising the GST. So why are we even having this conversation about tax? Apparently not to raise more tax, because Morrison would have us believe that won\u2019t happen. But the reality is we have a revenue problem, and we also have a spending problem. Alas, the treasurer seems incapable of realising that of the two, the revenue issue is the bigger one. In the eight years since the GFC hit, the budget has been in deficit. To demonstrate just how big the revenue problem has been, consider this: if the government had not increased spending for stimulus measures and assorted programs and instead kept spending at the average of the eight years before the GFC hit, the budget would still have been in deficit every single year: Conversely, if revenue hadn\u2019t collapsed and the government had available to it the average revenue of the eight years leading up to the GFC, the budget would have been in surplus for four of the past eight years. Cumulatively, revenue over the past eight years was 20.5% of GDP below the 2000-01 to 2007-08 average; whereas cumulative spending was just 8.6% of GDP above the average. In effect, lower revenue was responsible for about 70% of the deficits we have had since the GFC hit. The good news is the budget is predicted to be almost in balance by 2018-19. The bad news is that relies on GDP growth which keeps getting revised down. Last Friday, the RBA revised down its estimate for GDP growth in December 2017 from 3%-4.5% to 3%-4%. The estimates are still within that estimated in the budget, but the margins are getting slim. And the issue \u2013 as Lenore Taylor has highlighted \u2013 is that the budget by 2018-19 is only predicted to be in near balance because of some very large cuts in the growth of expenditure in areas like health and education. But this mix of a need for revenue and slowing spending in health and education brings with it a pretty major problem. When you change the tax mix from one of progressive income tax to greater reliance upon regressive GST, the government will have to increase expenditure to compensate unless it wishes to make the system more regressive. The aged pension, Newstart, the disability support pension and all other cash benefits will have to increase, because just lowering income tax cannot compensate those on low incomes. So if Morrison wants to keep the overall tax take the same, but is also increasing welfare and other cash benefits, then to keep the budget in that nice balanced position he currently hopes it to be in 2018-19, government spending overall cannot increase either. And if welfare spending is increasing that means spending elsewhere has to decrease. The problem is that income tax and welfare spending are only part of the ways in which our system works to reduce inequality. The other way is spending in areas such as education and health. These provide people with \u201csocial transfers in kind\u201d \u2013 effectively the value of goods or services that households receive for free or subsidised: Prior to welfare and income tax, the top 20% receive about 46% of all of Australia\u2019s private income, and the poorest 20% receive around 4%. After welfare and income tax, this changes to 39% for the richest and 7.7% for the poorest. Once the social transfers are taken into account (and education and health are the two biggest), the richest 20% now have around 34.5% of Australia\u2019s disposable income and the poorest 20% get around 10%.

      "body": "<p>When talking of the budget, treasurer Scott Morrison has been quick to talk of a spending problem and just as quick to dismiss any talk of a revenue problem. Now, as he tries to suggest changes need to be made to the taxation system, he conversely has neglected to talk about government spending. His one-side-only approach to the budget will need to end if he wants to propose a new tax system that keeps the system fair and which voters will accept. </p> <p>Since Malcolm Turnbull assumed the office of prime minister and Morrison became treasurer, the tax debate has turned such that it has become almost a fait accompli that the GST will either be raised or broadened. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/06/when-is-a-budget-cut-not-a-saving-when-we-can-no-longer-afford-the-essentials\">When is a budget cut not a saving? When we can no longer afford the essentials | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And why should it be raised? Well, the prime minister has told us it is all about efficiency \u2013 a GST, he argues, is an efficient tax. </p> <p>And so it is, but we shouldn\u2019t get too excited about the benefits the added efficiency will bring. </p> <p>In April this year, <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2015/working-paper-2015-01\">the Treasury</a> produced a working paper which looked at the efficiency of various taxes. Stamp duties came in as the worst tax \u2013 costing around 70 cents in economic output per $1 raised. </p> <p>By contrast, a flat rate income tax cost 21 cents per $1 of tax raised and the ever efficient GST cost just 19 cents. </p> <p>The Treasury only modelled a flat income tax and not a progressive one such as we have, so you could add a cent or two onto the cost, but still the difference between the cost of the income tax and the GST is pretty slight. </p> <p>And certainly the difference is not enough to be a very big selling point \u2013 especially since the efficiency of a GST overall will be reduced because to combat its regressive nature, welfare will have to be increased. As Michael Potter from the Centre for Independent Studies noted <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-02/potter-the-flaws-of-an-increased-gst-might-outweigh-the-benefits/6905012\">last week</a>, such welfare payments would likely serve to further reduce the efficiency of raising the GST. </p> <p>So why are we even having this conversation about tax? </p> <p>Apparently not to raise more tax, because Morrison would have us believe that won\u2019t happen. But the reality is we have a revenue problem, and we also have a spending problem. Alas, the treasurer seems incapable of realising that of the two, the revenue issue is the bigger one. </p> <p>In the eight years since the GFC hit, the budget has been in deficit. To demonstrate just how big the revenue problem has been, consider this: if the government had not increased spending for stimulus measures and assorted programs and instead kept spending at the average of the eight years <em>before</em> the GFC hit, the budget would still have been in deficit every single year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australian government revenue and expenditure 200-2016\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Uc8N5/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Conversely, if revenue hadn\u2019t collapsed and the government had available to it the average revenue of the eight years leading up to the GFC, the budget would have been in surplus for four of the past eight years. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australian government revenue and expenditure 2000-2016\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vcJj4/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Cumulatively, revenue over the past eight years was 20.5% of GDP below the 2000-01 to 2007-08 average; whereas cumulative spending was just 8.6% of GDP above the average.</p> <p>In effect, lower revenue was responsible for about 70% of the deficits we have had since the GFC hit. </p> <p>The good news is the budget is predicted to be almost in balance by 2018-19. The bad news is that relies on GDP growth which keeps getting revised down. </p> <p>Last Friday, <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2015/nov/pdf/06-economic-outlook.pdf\">the RBA</a> revised down its estimate for GDP growth in December 2017 from 3%-4.5% to 3%-4%. </p> <p>The estimates are still within that estimated in the budget, but the margins are getting slim. </p> <p>And the issue \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/06/when-is-a-budget-cut-not-a-saving-when-we-can-no-longer-afford-the-essentials\">Lenore Taylor has highlighted</a> \u2013 is that the budget by 2018-19 is only predicted to be in near balance because of some very large cuts in the growth of expenditure in areas like health and education. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Growth in Commonwealth government expenditure on schools.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YPzJA/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But this mix of a need for revenue and slowing spending in health and education brings with it a pretty major problem.</p> <p>When you change the tax mix from one of progressive income tax to greater reliance upon regressive GST, the government will have to increase expenditure to compensate unless it wishes to make the system more regressive. </p> <p>The aged pension, Newstart, the disability support pension and all other cash benefits will have to increase, because just lowering income tax cannot compensate those on low incomes.</p> <p>So if Morrison wants to keep the overall tax take the same, but is also increasing welfare and other cash benefits, then to keep the budget in that nice balanced position he currently hopes it to be in 2018-19, government spending overall cannot increase either. </p> <p>And if welfare spending is increasing that means spending elsewhere has to decrease. </p> <p>The problem is that income tax and welfare spending are only part of the ways in which our system works to reduce inequality. The other way is spending in areas such as education and health. These provide people with \u201csocial transfers in kind\u201d \u2013 effectively the value of goods or services that households receive for free or subsidised: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breakdown of total income, tax and social security by household income quintile\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/R4dGK/7/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Prior to welfare and income tax, the top 20% receive about 46% of all of Australia\u2019s private income, and the poorest 20% receive around 4%.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s gender pay gap will leave women effectively working for free from 9 November until the end of the year, according to equality campaigners. This year, Equal Pay Day falls on this date, according to the Fawcett Society, which uses official statistics on hourly pay for full-time workers. With the gender pay gap at 14.2%, it falls just five days later than last year, and only two days later than in 2013. The fact that it repeatedly falls in early November reflects how little progress has been made in closing the gap in salaries for men and women. The figure of 14.2% reflects the pay gap for men and women working full time, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. The figures are for 2014 \u2013 the latest available data \u2013 and are measured by average gross hourly pay. This compares to 15.7% for the previous year. Campaigners warn that, based on the tiny reduction in the pay gap last year, it would take 54 years to reach parity at current rates. More than four decades after the Equal Pay Act was introduced, the divide remains across the workforce. Looking at all workers, in full- or part-time employment, the gender pay gap is 19.1%. The UK figure compares with an EU average of 16.4%. Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: \u201cThere has never been a better opportunity to close the pay gap for good. Progress has stalled in recent years but with real commitment from government and employers, together with action from women and men at work, we could speed up progress towards the day when we can consign it to history.\u201d David Cameron has vowed to \u201cend the gender pay gap in a generation\u201d, and set out new rules forcing every company that employs more than 250 people to publish the difference between the average pay of its male and female employees. Among Britain\u2019s top earners, the pay divide between men and women is nearly 55%, according to the TUC. The top 2% of male earners bring in more than \u00a3117,352 a year, while women get \u00a375,745. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThese figures show that the glass ceiling is barely cracked, let alone broken. It is shocking the UK still has such large gender pay differences at the top of the labour market after more than four decades of equal pay and sex discrimination legislation. We need pay transparency, equal pay audits, and a requirement on companies to tackle gender inequality \u2013 or face fines.\u201d Both the TUC and the Fawcett Society believe the government must go further, calling for action plans for employers to close the pay gap in their workplace, as well as tough penalties for companies that fail to comply. Other new recommendations, from the Virgin Money boss, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, who is leading a government-backed review, include linking the bonuses of City executives to hitting targets for the number of senior women appointed at a firm. Fewer women make it to the top in the financial sector than in any other industry. Also last week, the former Conservative minister for women and equalities, Maria Miller, launched an inquiry by the women and equalities committee into government strategy on reducing the difference between what women and men are paid. She said that unequal pay mainly affected women over 40. Meanwhile, according to new research, women are less likely to receive workplace training than men, and men are more likely than women to receive a pay rise following training. The study, published today by the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE) and the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, will say that women are usually given generic training, while companies pay for men to become better leaders. Women get paid 22% less on apprenticeships than their male equivalents. As more than 60% of those earning less than the living wage are women, the Fawcett Society called on companies to become living wage employers. The charity welcomed the introduction of shared parental leave, but remained concerned that too few dads will be able to take it. There should be a dedicated period of leave for fathers and their paternity pay should be closer to what they otherwise would earn, it said. Smethers added: \u201cThe message to women and men at work is \u2013 it\u2019s OK to talk about pay. How can we achieve pay equality if we don\u2019t even know what our colleagues earn?\u201d Fiona Aldridge, of NIACE, said: \u201cAdvancements in flexible working have helped to ensure that there are now a record number of women in work, but this flexibility is often accompanied by a hidden pay penalty: the hourly pay difference between full-time and part-time workers is currently 25%.\u201d Lord Mervyn Davies, who has been championing gender equality in the boardroom, said in a report last month that at least a third of directorships at Britain\u2019s biggest companies should be held by women by the end of the decade, but stopped short of recommending legally enforceable quotas. Critics point out that women tend to be appointed to non-executive director roles, rather than more powerful roles on the executive board. The UK ranks sixth in Europe in terms of female boardroom representation, behind Norway, Sweden, France, Finland and Belgium, many of which \u2013 such as Norway, where women make up 35% of board members \u2013 have set formal quotas for female representation.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pay rises will remain subdued over the next year, despite Britain\u2019s robust recovery and complaints from business leaders of acute skills shortages, according to a survey of employers. Wages will increase by an average of 2% over the next year as UK employers continue to recruit the workers they need without significantly hiking wages. The survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel &amp; Development found that the number of applicants per vacancy remained steady over the past year, with average applications for jobs running at 25 for each low-skilled role, 15 for medium-skilled roles and eight for highly skilled roles. The CIPD said this response showed employers still had the whip hand in the labour market, with most businesses seeing a steady flow of suitable candidates when they advertise jobs. Only a limited number of industries were hit by skills shortages and many of those were putting more resources into training their existing staff or employing apprentices to fill the gaps. Gerwyn Davies, a labour market analyst at the CIPD, said: \u201cIt seems that armageddon warnings about the UK facing a skills shortage crisis understate the ability of many employers to ease their recruitment problems. \u201cMany have heeded previous warnings of a tightening jobs market by providing more job opportunities for young people, including through apprenticeships, while up-skilling the existing workforce. At the same time, others are using migrant workers to strengthen their defence against a tightening labour market.\u201d The number of organisations reporting at least one hard-to-fill vacancy increased from 44% to 49%. The most acute problems were confined to the manufacturing and production sectors, however, which included industries such as construction and utilities as well as the finance and retail sectors. The likelihood of UK employers offering low wage rises for another year will be noted by Bank of England policymakers. They have indicated that they are unwilling to raise interest rates without strong signs that higher wages are pushing up prices in the shops. Last week Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said inflationary pressures remained weak and hinted that interest rates were unlikely to rise until late in 2016. The prospect of muted pay rises come despite George Osborne setting a new minimum wage of \u00a37.20 an hour from next April, up 50p from the current minimum wage of \u00a36.70. This measure is expected to lift the earnings of only a small section \u2013 between 2.5m and 3m \u2013 of Britain\u2019s 30m workforce. According to the chair of the Low Pay Commission, David Norgrove, it will also lead to more than the predicted 60,000 redundancies across the economy as employers seek to reduce costs. In a separate report, the CBI warned that Britain\u2019s recovery was unlikely to gather significant momentum, given the gloomier outlook for global growth and the likely blow to demand for UK manufactured exports. The business lobby group cut its forecast for GDP growth this year to 2.4% from 2.6%. It expects the UK economy to grow 2.6% next year, a cut from from its previous estimate of 2.8%. Publishing its updated outlook before the CBI annual conference, it said the UK was still looking \u201cresilient in the face of global headwinds\u201d, but factory output was likely to stagnate. The CBI\u2019s director-general, John Cridland, said: \u201cManufacturers are enduring tougher conditions, as a persistently strong pound is hamstringing our export competitiveness, alongside dampened global growth. But our domestic story is strong and overall we are now in a phase of stable but solid economic growth.\u201d The CBI also pushed back its forecasts for a rate hike from the Bank of England. It now expects the first hike in more than eight years to come in the second quarter of 2016 \u2013 later than its previous forecast, which had predicted a rise in the first quarter. A survey of businesses by the accountants BDO also heightened concerns that manufacturers face a hard slog next year, in contrast to the more buoyant services sector. BDO\u2019s optimism index, which predicts growth six months ahead, remained above its long-term trend in October at 101.9, indicating that UK businesses expect their order books to continue to grow strongly. However, this reading masked \u201cserious concerns among manufacturers\u201d, the firm said. The index for manufacturing suffered a fall to 90.2, while service sector businesses expected rapid growth, with optimism scores well above the trend at 104.2. \u201cIt seems that the UK\u2019s makers fear a sudden contraction as we go into 2016, even if trading remains strong today,\u201d the report said. \u201cThese trends could see the UK economy become even more unbalanced as sluggish manufacturing growth becomes entrenched and the UK becomes even more reliant on the service sector for growth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "More than a quarter of Britain\u2019s largest companies are failing to explain to investors the criteria by which top executives are awarded bonuses, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC, which advises many FTSE 100 firms on executive pay, said 28% of Britain\u2019s largest public companies are excusing themselves from a requirement, which was introduced two years ago, to explain performance pay. Companies that offer only very limited disclosures, or decline altogether to explain the basis for payouts, have told shareholders that fuller explanations risked giving away commercially sensitive information. Under the 2013 disclosure rules, this excuses companies from a requirement to spell out performance pay measures. But PwC in a report entitled \u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant\u201d, a PwC partner Fiona Camenzuli said that data from the past two years showed that those businesses with the fullest disclosure were also the best at tying bonuses to profit growth. Camenzuli said: \u201cDistrust in executive pay is driven by the belief in some quarters that bonuses don\u2019t reflect performance. Our research suggests that the discipline of better disclosure of how bonus targets are set and met is significantly improving the link between pay and performance. \u201cPay has become more strongly linked to performance since companies have been required to provide fuller disclosure. The link between pay and performance is twice as high in the FTSE 100 companies that provide full target disclosure than in those that don\u2019t.\u201d Camenzuli added that it \u201cseems inevitable\u201d all companies will eventually be pressured by their investors to make full disclosures on bonus payouts. She said there was evidence that greater disclosure was combining with pressure from investors to force those non-executives responsible for setting pay to take a tougher and more robust approach. Sarah Wilson, of Manifest, a firm that advises shareholders of boardroom pay and other issues, agreed. \u201cCommercial sensitivity [as an excuse] does not hold when it is the previous year\u2019s performance you are reporting on. There are still remuneration committees that offer only limited disclosure [of bonus criteria] and that exercise discretion over bonuses \u2013 that\u2019s a toxic combination.\u201d The PwC survey found that only 36% of FTSE 100 firms provided shareholders with full disclosure of all the performance thresholds used to determine performance pay in 2014. A further 24% gave only a single \u201con-target\u201d performance indicator for bonuses, while 12% offered a description of the criteria without giving numbers. That left 28% providing little or no disclosures at all.",
