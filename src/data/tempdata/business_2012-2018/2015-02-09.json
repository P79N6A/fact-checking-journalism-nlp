      "bodyText": "The UK authorities were already in possession of detailed evidence about wrongdoing at HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank when David Cameron made the executive chairman of its parent bank, Stephen Green, a government minister, the Guardian has established. French tax authorities passed leaked Swiss data containing 6,000 British names to Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs in May 2010. Lord Green\u2019s appointment as a Conservative trade minister in the House of Lords was made public a few months later. Green was executive chairman of the HSBC bank group from 2006 to 2010. The bank\u2019s current management now admit serious \u201ccompliance and control failures\u201d occurred at the Swiss bank before January 2011 when HSBC\u2019s current chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, took over. HMRC is also facing questions about its handling of the leaked Swiss data. Its then head of tax, Dave Hartnett, went on to work for HSBC as a consultant after his retirement two years after the data was handed over. The UK has taken no legal action against the bank despite the evidence in the leaked files of wrongdoing, and only one individual has faced prosecution. In France, HSBC is being prosecuted for what the authorities call organised \u201cmoney-laundering\u201d while Belgian prosecutors charged the Swiss bank on suspicion of helping clients evade tax using offshore vehicles. France has recovered \u00a3188m in taxes and fines from a list of 3,000 clients and Spain has recovered \u00a3220m, also from 3,000 clients. The UK, by contrast, has recovered just \u00a3135m from a list of 6,000 clients in a series of secret deals that kept names out of the public domain. Many evaders were offered light penalties of only 10% of tax due, plus immunity from prosecution. The Guardian has pieced together a timeline of the material\u2019s journey into possession of the UK authorities. Documents disclose that in early February 2010 news was first passed in confidence, under international tax information-sharing agreements, that the French government had obtained a sensational leak from HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank. The leak had come from HSBC\u2019s IT technician in Geneva, Herv\u00e9 Falciani, from whom French police seized the incriminating data. France offered to pass on the contents of the so-called \u201cSwiss disc\u201d to HMRC. On 11 February 2010, Hartnett went to see HSBC at its London headquarters, according to his hospitality register. The Guardian asked Hartnett what was said at that meeting about the Swiss leak. He said: \u201cLunch was sandwiches, fruit juice and water. You will have to ask HMRC for details of what was discussed.\u201d In May 2010, HMRC was handed a reconstructed UK version of the data by the French. But while tax inspectors began ploughing through their evidence at their London headquarters, a change of British government was taking place. Cameron\u2019s Conservative-led coalition came to power. A couple of weeks later, it was reported that Green would step down from his \u00a31.25m-a-year HSBC job, and by August Cameron was reported to have persuaded him to take on the post of trade minister. \u201cIn Stephen we will be appointing a minister with a long career as a leading international banker,\u201d the Lib Dem business secretary, Vince Cable, said in a statement issued after the announcement: \u201cOne of the few to emerge with credit from the recent financial crisis, and somebody who has set out a powerful philosophy for ethical business.\u201d A source close to Cable said the welcoming remarks on Green referred to HSBC\u2019s position as the sole major UK bank not requiring a bailout in the financial crisis, and to Green\u2019s writings and speeches on ethical business. Contacted by the Guardian on Monday as to his view on his former junior minister in the light of the HSBC revelations, Cable said: \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know at present if Lord Green was aware of or condoned these practices.\u201d HSBC now accepts that customers, many of them British, had been taking advantage of the secrecy on offer to set up undeclared Swiss accounts. Yet at HMRC it was decided that prominent British individuals found to be cheating on their taxes would not be prosecuted, a process which would have led to them being named and the facts coming out. Hartnett has defended the secret tax repayment deals. \u201cThere was never an intention to deliberately use taxpayer confidentiality to hide the identity of HSBC clients.\u201d Lin Homer, the overall head of HMRC, also defended this non-prosecution approach before the UK\u2019s public accounts committee in 2012, as a cheaper source of revenue. \u201cThe important thing is to get the money in,\u201d she said. But the committee which questioned her was unaware of the mountain of evidence that existed of wrongdoing at HSBC itself. Margaret Hodge, the committee chair, said on Monday: \u201cI am no lawyer. But it seems to me absolutely clear that we\u2019ve got an open and shut case of a systemic policy to support hundreds of people in avoiding paying their tax. And I think the tax authorities here in the UK, HMRC, should look to challenging the bank in the courts.\u201d Other European countries have launched prosecutions against individual clients of HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank since being passed the files. In France last year, Arlette Ricci, heir to a perfume fortune, became the first of some 50 clients to be hauled into court, where she denied tax fraud. In Belgium, a score of Antwerp diamond traders were raided and the bank itself was charged. In the US, not only have individual HSBC tax evaders been prosecuted, but in a separate investigation, the bank narrowly avoided the loss of its licence in 2012 for allowing drug cartels to launder millions of dollars through the group\u2019s Mexican division. Assistant attorney general Larry Breuer said a criminal prosecution would have cost too many jobs and destabilised the banking system. HSBC was allowed to settle with some harsh publicity and cash penalties of $1.9bn. Hartnett retired from HMRC in 2012. Six months later, while the Swiss disc was still under investigation by his old department, he went on the payroll of HSBC itself. He was being hired, the bank said, to advise on its reformed anti money-laundering measures. The watchdog which vets such moves from government jobs into the private sector, the advisory committee on business appointments (ACOBA), was assured, it says, that Hartnett \u201chad official dealings with HSBC over a number of years, but that these contacts were no more significant than the contacts he had with other banks operating in the UK\u201d. Hartnett denies that this version of events was misleading. He said: \u201cI made a detailed application to ACOBA referring specifically to the investigation of customers of HSBC Geneva. My application was reviewed and countersigned by the HMRC chief executive.\u201d He adds it was \u201cHMRC\u2019s chairman who took an interest in the work of the Enforcement and Compliance directorate. I did not then, or at any other time, get involved in decisions about HSBC investigations. You are therefore wrong to associate me with accountability for performance in this area.\u201d HMRC\u2019s chairman at the time was a business outsider, Mike Clasper, the former chief executive of airports operator BAA. He did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "webTitle": "Greece planning to ask Eurogroup for longer bridge programme - live updates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all for tonight. Just a quick recap: Greece is considering asking its European partners for a longer bridging loan, to cover its funding needs until the end of August. The finance ministry is also considering proposing 10 new reforms at the Eurogroup meeting on Wednesday night. It\u2019s a sign that Athens may be softening its position, but there\u2019s nothing official yet. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has warned that it would be catastrophic if the eurozone collapsed. Speaking to the Guardian, Varoufakis said: \u201cAllowing [the single currency] to fragment would be catastrophic \u2026 it is the moral duty of the critics of the Euro Zone to fix it, to make sure it doesn\u2019t collapse because if it does the cost will be immense not just for the Greeks but the Brits, everyone.\u201d The Greek stock market suffered another selloff, down almost 5%, after Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech to parliament last night - in which he ruled out implementing Greece\u2019s old austerity programme. Tsipras was upbeat today on a visit to Vienna, after Austria\u2019s chancellor said all sides must compromise. But Germany remains implacable; Angela Merkel said tonight it is up to Greece to produce substantive plans for the way ahead. Fears over the strength of Greece\u2019s financial sector prompted Moody\u2019s to downgrade five banks. And as covered in the lunchtime summary, Britain has started preparing emergency plans for a Grexit: I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Goodnight, and thanks for all the comments. GW You\u2019d think there was an election coming up.... The AFP newswire has also heard that the Greek government is planning to ask the eurogroup for bridging funding until the end of August, while it hammers out a new long-term plan. Via Kathimerini: Greece wants a new economic deal with its EU creditors to enter into force from September 1, a Finance Ministry source said Monday. \u201cIt is in our interest to have the deal running from September 1, the source said, ahead of crucial talks with eurozone finance ministers on Wednesday. Over in Washington DC, Angela Merkel has told reporters that \u201cwhat counts\u201d is the plan that Greece brings to the eurogroup meeting on Wednesday night. The German chancellor declined to speculate on Greece\u2019s plans until Athens has come up with a sustainable proposal. So, no indication whether she\u2019d be amenable to a bridging loan until the end of August, tied to various (as yet unspecified) new reform measures, as we understand the Greek government is considering (see earlier post). Rating agency Moody\u2019s just cut the credit rating on five major Greek banks, as fears over the country\u2019s future in the eurozone continue to swirl. Last Friday night, Moody\u2019s put Greece\u2019s sovereign debt rating on review for a possible downgrade. Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group reckons Athens will probably execute a \u201cdirty exit\u201d from its bailout at the end of the month, but it\u2019s not a given. Although the Greek government\u2019s policy manifesto includes a number of important concessions to European creditors, it does not go far enough to create the basis for a deal. Therefore, we remain of the view that Greece will undertake a \u201cdirty exit\u201d of its bailout on 28 February with no agreed backstop in place but this is a very close call. Economic and financial stress will increase over the next few weeks, but supportive public opinion means the risk of government collapse over the next few weeks is unlikely (45%). After another day of heavy selling, Greece\u2019s stock market closed down almost 5% tonight. Bank shares were, again, hit by the growing fears that Greece could be ejected from the eurozone. The euro was pretty calm, though. It\u2019s currently up 0.15% against the US dollar. Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, says it\u2019s \u201cpointless to peg a specific likelihood of a Grexit\u201d, but concedes that this \u201ctail-risk scenario is probably \u201cshifting closer to the centre of the bell curve\u201d. Greek financial news website Euro2Day has also published details of Greece\u2019s possible strategy for Wednesday night\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. They suggest that Athens may ask for a bridging loan to cover funding needs until September [as we flagged up at 15.47 GMT]. And they\u2019ve also heard the rumour that Greece might propose 10 new reforms to cover the parts of the bailout programme which it is now rejecting. Meanwhile in Berlin...Alexis Tsipras\u2019s demand for Germany to pay war reparations, and repay the interest-free loan extracted from Greece during world war 2, has been robustly rejected. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s vice chancellor and economy minister, said there is \u201czero\u201d probability of this happening. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has been giving a hint of the way he\u2019ll approach Wednesday night\u2019s emergency eurogroup meeting. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports that Varoufakis, who met with Athens reporters earlier, is planning to stick to his guns. He\u2019ll push his fellow European finance ministers to accept a \u201cbridge programme\u201d to cover the government\u2019s funding needs while a new debt pact can be agreed. But the Athens government is indicating that its creditors at the EU/ECB/IMF could call such a programme whatever they like. And there\u2019s talk that this bridging loan could run until the end of August [only this morning, Varoufakis suggested a four-month bridge -- it just keeps growing....] This suggests it might not differ too much from the six-month extension that the eurogroup was pushing last December [but which former prime minister Samaras rejected, in favour of a two-month window]. But what about the various \u2018prior actions\u2019 that Greece agreed, but hasn\u2019t yet implemented? Well, Varoufakis is likely to pledge to implement around 70% of the existing bailout programme [a point he made to parliament earlier]. We\u2019re hearing that he might give the eurogroup details of perhaps ten new measures to replace the missing 30%. Another photo of those pro-Athens protests in Vienna today: Speaking of world leaders.. Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel has arrived at the White House for talks with president Barack Obama. The Ukraine crisis is top of the agenda, but I suspect they\u2019ll touch on Greece too. There were pro-Greece protests in Vienna today, as prime minister Alexis Tsipras visited Austria to meet chancellor Faymann. As mentioned earlier, Faymnn called for compromise over the Greek debt battle: \u201cThe question is finding a solution between the content of the framework agreed in the past and the efforts of the new [Greek] government,\u201d And Tsipras also sounded upbeat, telling reporters: \u201cWe all have an interest in coming to a mutually beneficial solution.\u201d Those who invested in the Greek government\u2019s failure were \u201cplaying with fire and the danger of the far right rising in Europe,\u201d Tsipras said. And from Athens, Helena reports that Greek TV stations seized on Tsipras\u2019s optimistic tone: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s comments were in a different vein to what we have been hearing [from within and without Greece]. It is clear he wants a solution. Perhaps he knows something that no one else does?\u201d said Marko Deimizi, who anchors SKAI TVs popular Magazino show. The rising tensions in Greece have rippled across to the New York stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average and the wider S&amp;P 500 both dipped around 0.25% at the start of trading. So how could things develop from here? Professor Hari Tsoukas of Warwick Business School fears that Greece\u2019s creditors will refuse to alter its bailout programme, because they don\u2019t believe Athens can implement reforms. Tsoukas (who ran for the centrist Potami party in last month\u2019s elections) says: \u201cThe terms of debt relief for Greece will be decided, ultimately, by politics. Power is what matters, and power is with the creditors, not Greece. The fundamentals of the bailout programme are unlikely to change. \u201cMy sense is that Alexis Tsipras will not back off, for if he does, he knows he will incur the fate of his predecessor \u2013 sticking with austerity will cost him dearly. Besides, he may hope that by putting up a fight, he may ultimately force creditors to change their view, since a Greek exit will be potentially disastrous for the Euro zone. \u201cUnless there is compromise - which for the time being I see as difficult to be achieved - a likely scenario is for Tsipras to put whatever deal he cuts with the creditors to a referendum or call fresh elections. That will complicate things enormously, especially since, most likely, there will be a bank run and the banking system will collapse. The growing popularity of Spain\u2019s new Podemos party highlights why European leaders are unwilling to cut Greece a deal, for fear of vindicating the anti-austerity movement. (Europe\u2019s weak growth and near-record unemployment could be all the vindication we need, mind you....) Germany\u2019s finance minister is maintaining an uncompromising attitude on Greece today. Attending the G20 ministers meeting in Istanbul, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble declared that he didn\u2019t know how the markets would react if Greece abandoned its bailout, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve never forced anyone into a programme. I\u2019m ready for any kind of help, but if my help is not wanted, that\u2019s fine.\u201d So there! Maybe Herr Sch\u00e4uble is sore that The Economist has dubbed him \u201cEurope\u2019s foremost ayatollah of austerity\u201d Associate Press has the full quote from Yanis Varoufakis to the Athens parliament: \u201cThe time has come to say what officials admit when the microphones are turned off and say out in the open. ... At some point someone has to say \u2018No\u2019 and that role has fallen to us, little Greece,\u201d After speaking to the Guardian, Varoufakis went on to address the Athens parliament, as the debate ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s confidence vote picks up. The Greek finance minister got a standing ovation as he said: \u201csomeone has to say No and that is Greece!\u201d. But he also tried not to sound too confrontational, saying the new government would implement around 70% of the current Memorandum of Understanding agreed with the Troika. Back to Athens, and Yanis Varoufakis has outlined how Greece and its lenders can find a mutually agreed face-saving solution. The key, he told our Helena Smith, is Greece\u2019s proposal of a bridging program for two, or three, or four months \u201cto which we make some undertakings to our partners\u201d. During that time the new government would forge ahead with crucial reforms that could be mutually agreed while ensuring the budget is not derailed. \u201cAnd why do we want this to have the time and the space to sit down and deliberate? We just want a little bit of time....\u201d The prime minister tweets.. Over in Greece our correspondent Helena Smith can confirm that Yanis Varoufakis is in fighting form \u2013 and optimistic about the future. Helena writes: I had a long sit-down with the Greek finance minister this morning, and he did not disappoint. Varoufakis\u2019s reaction to George Osborne\u2019s revelations on Sunday that Britain is stepping up contingency plans in preparation of a possible Greek exit from the euro zone was one of slight mystification. He had, he said, had very friendly discussions with the chancellor in London last week. \u201cAnybody can compile contingency plans but I don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d he told me in his sixth floor office overlooking Syntagma square, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to imagine what preparation he [Osborne] is putting in. Maybe he has aces up his sleeve that I am not familiar with.\u201d As for the Alan Greenspan\u2019s predicting Greece\u2019s exit from the currency bloc, Varoufakis was emphatic. The former head of the US federal reserve belonged to the school of thought that the euro zone was untenable \u2013 a view that, he himself, had been loud and clear about back in the 1990s. \u201cGreenspan is part of the tradition of Anglo Saxon financiers, economists and central bankers who never believed in the Eurozone construction. I happened to be one of them \u2026 back in the 1990s I was writing articles that argued that the way the euro zone was constructed was like removing the shock absorbers from the system [the single currency] and ensuring that when the shock comes it is of maximum [strength]. \u201cHowever, having said that, allowing it to fragment would be catastrophic \u2026 it is the moral duty of the critics of the Euro Zone to fix it, to make sure it doesn\u2019t collapse because if it does the cost will be immense not just for the Greeks but the Brits, everyone.\u201d The rest of the world would instantly go into recession, he said, if the eurozone collapsed. Describing himself as an \u201cinternationalist\u201d Varoufakis insisted that Greece\u2019s fate was inextricably bound up with that of Europe. But he was also clear-headedly optimistic. \u201cI cannot possibly separate the fate of Greece from the fate of Europe\u2026 We are perfectly capable as Europeans to mess things up unnecessarily. We can find the accommodation between Greece and our creditors, our partners, the EU, ECB and IMF,\u201d he said before adding that in a depressed economy it was simply impossible for the policies of \u201ccontractionary contraction\u201d to work. \u201cThere is no economist I know in the world who thinks this program has worked, or will work \u2026 it couldn\u2019t work. It\u2019s not a question of willpower or intelligence, it simply cannot be done in a depressed economy that has no viable banking system that is properly functioning and giving out loans.\u201d At the same time Greece\u2019s new government recognised that a loan agreement had been signed and that Athens had entered into a \u201clegal framework\u201d with its international creditors. Varoufakis concluded: \u201cThere has to be continuity but at the same time the argument that the elections don\u2019t change anything and that the government has to adopt a program it was elected to challenge the logic of, is absurd.\u201d The leader of Austria, Werner Faymann, has offered Greece some support after a meeting with prime minister Alexis Tsipras today. Chancellor Faymann told reporters in Athens that both sides must compromise: Tsipras sounds upbeat too: Time for a quick recap, before we hear from the Greek finance minister in under an hour\u2019s time (3pm EET/1pm GMT). Greece\u2019s escalating debt crisis has sent shares sliding across Europe, and triggered a new selloff in Greek bonds. The Athens market is down 6%, as bank shares suffer new double-digit falls. In London the FTSE 100 has lost 54 points. Fears that Greece might default also drove yields high into dangerous territory; the three-year Greek bond hit levels not seen since its 2012 restructuring. The selloff was sparked by last night\u2019s speech by prime minister Alexis Tsipras; he laid out a comprehensive plan to end austerity, and also pledged not to extend the country\u2019s bailout programme [see last night\u2019s story]. Although Greece insists it can reach a deal with its creditors, there are signs that the crisis is sending shivers through the global community. UK prime minister David Cameron held a briefing on Britain\u2019s plan if Greece leaves the eurozone, this morning. Genuine concern, or a politically-motivated move, some wonder.... European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker warned Tsipras that he can\u2019t expect Europe to simply accept his proposals. Canada\u2019s finance minister urged both sides to make compromises. And Timothy Adams of the Institute of International Finance warned that time is running out. City analysts are also increasingly concerned. Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital said Tsipras\u2019s speech had raised the chance of Greece leaving the eurozone, to 50%. But Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has insisted that there\u2019s no conflict with the rest of Europe -- even though fellow nations have shown little support for his attempt to re-engineer the debt mountain. However, Varoufakis\u2019s claim yesterday that Italy also faces unsustainable debts may not have helped his cause, suggests the FT\u2019s editor.... UK officials have dug into their filing cabinets to find the Grexit plan pulled together at the height of the eurozone crisis, tweets Sky\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway. (that\u2019s Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury) But insiders still reckon a compromise will be hammered out... Here\u2019s a summary of the headlines in today\u2019s Greek newspapers, via Enikos.gr. \u201cAlexis message to the Germans: Hand over the money you owe us from WWII\u201d is the main story in Kontranews. Ethnos says that the Greek PM adopts a tough line in the negotiations with the lenders. Eleftheros Typos reckons that Tsipras is set for a head-on conflict with the troika whereas at the same time is looking for a bridging agreement. Ta Nea reveals that 85 names are missing from the \u2018Lagarde list\u2019 [of suspected tax avoiders] I Efimerida ton Syntakton quotes Tsipras: \u2018Our dignity is non-negotiable\u2019 Right-wing Eleftheri Ora says that Alexis Tsipras is Greece\u2019s Che Guevara! The selloff in Athens is picking up pace, sending the main ATG index down almost 6% today. It\u2019s heading back towards the lows plumbed immediately after Syriza won last month\u2019s election. The word from Westminster is that David Cameron chaired a meeting with officials from the finance ministry and the Bank of England this morning, to plan for a possible Greek exit from the euro zone. We\u2019ll have more details very soon. In the meantime, one Treasury source has told Reuters that: \u201cIt is not saying that anyone thinks it is going to happen, but it is right that they have a look at the risk of Greece leaving the euro zone. That would create real instability.\u201d Just what the UK government doesn\u2019t want, three months before the general election. Heads-up: Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, is expected to hold a press conference this afternoon, around 3pm local time or 1pm GMT. Canada\u2019s finance minister has urged Greece and its international creditors to find a compromise. Joe Oliver (in Istanbul for the G20 meeting) told Reuters that both sides need to give ground: \u201cThere has to be compromise. It\u2019s clear that Greece has got to be prepared to make some changes, and I think a wholesale repudiation of their debt is not on the cards. But other countries, creditors will have to work with Greece to arrive at a compromise solution.\u201d Alexis Tsipras outlined a broad range of measures last night, to unravel the austerity programme that Greece has endured since 2010. Teneo Intelligence has helpfully rounded up the key commitments, which MPs will vote on tomorrow night: Abolish the single property tax (ENFIA) and replace it with another tax targeting large real estate properties. Re-increase the tax-free threshold to \u20ac12k (from its current \u20ac5K). Restore the 13th pension for gross monthly pensions below \u20ac700 from end 2015. Introduce subsidized meals for families living below the poverty line. Rehire 3,500 civil servants who lost their jobs as a result of the mobility scheme introduced by the previous government in the public sector. However, this number would be subtracted from the 15,000 recruitments scheduled for this year. Raise the monthly minimum wage in the private sector from \u20ac586 (or \u20ac510 for under-25s) to its 2011 level of \u20ac751 by 2016. Restore collective wages bargaining with the advice of the International Labor Organization (ILO). Extend the existing ban on foreclosures of primary residences. Stop new privatizations, but extend concessions when in the national interest. Introduce legislation enabling the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) to exercise its full voting rights with no restrictions in recapitalized banks. Repel legislation providing immunity to the members of the boards of the HFSF, the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF) and the Bank of Greece. Introduce a new \u2018stable, simple and fair\u2019 tax system and fight corruption and tax evasion. Introduce a comprehensive reform of Greece\u2019s public sector. It\u2019s 2012 all over again - the BBC has learned that David Cameron has met with officials at the Treasury and the Bank of England to discuss the risk that Greece leaves the single currency. Greece\u2019s factory sector was already weakening before the current crisis erupted, new data shows. Industrial production across Greece shrank by 3.8% in December, compared to the previous year, according to statistics body ELSTAT. The only good news is that manufacturing picked up. Here\u2019s the details: Mining and quarrying production decreased by 13.2%. Manufacturing production increased by 2.1%. Electricity production decreased by 18.6%. Water supply production increased by 4.3%. Greece\u2019s finance minister is playing good cop this morning, denying that there\u2019s any dispute between Athens and its creditors. Yanis Varoufakis told reporters gathered outside the finance ministry that: \u201cThere is no conflict, there is discussion and consultation as always happens in the European family.\u201d And Varoufakis shot back \u201cDon\u2019t be so hasty\u201d, when asked if Greece should hold a referendum on the debt crisis. Via Kathimerini. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has warned Greece this morning that the eurozone can\u2019t simply accept all of Syriza\u2019s programme. Juncker told reporters in Germany that Tsipras\u2019s speech last night had \u201conly partly addressed\u201d Brussels\u2019 concerns about his plans. The BBC\u2019s esteemed economics editor is many things, but thick is certainly not one of them.... This chart shows how Grexit worries drove Greek bond yields higher at the start of trading: Another bad morning for Greek bank shares: The Greek parliament is starting to debate the programme that was outlined by Alexis Tsipras last night. Twitter user Diane Shugart is watching, and reports that it\u2019s a slow - and confusing - start. The OECD has also highlighted how Greece\u2019s wealth tumbled, relative to rich countries, since the financial crisis began. Katie Allen explains: The OECD report highlights large increases in income inequality and poverty in Greece, alongside other countries hit hardest by the crisis: Iceland, Ireland and Spain. The OECD is making another attempt to get finance ministers to take inequality seriously. The thinktank told the G20 finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Istanbul to prioritise growth-friendly measures such as educating low-skilled workers and getting more women into work. Katie Allen has the full story: OECD: changes must cut inequality, not just boost economic growth Tsipras\u2019s speech marked a hardening of tone from the Greek government, points out analyst Wolf Piccoli: The Greek stock market has fallen back to a near one-week low this morning: The selloff across European stock markets is picking up pace, sending the main indices deeper into the red. Here\u2019s the damage: Traders blame the escalating Greek crisis, and also cite disappointing Chinese trade data overnight (exports fell 3.3% in January, suggesting global demand weakening.) Ilya Spivak, currency strategist, at DailyFX, says: \u201cComments from newly-minted Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rejecting his country\u2019s EU/IMF bailout \u2013 raising the probability of so-called \u201cGrexit\u201d \u2013 compounded investors\u2019 dour mood.\u201d Greek bonds are tumbling in value this morning, underlining how the crisis has escalated over the weekend. This has driven the interest rate (yield) on its debt sharply higher, reflecting a greater risk of default. The yield on Greece\u2019s three-year bond has leapt to 19.15%, from around 18.1% on Friday night. That\u2019s an alarmingly high level. The yield on Greece\u2019s 10-year bond has jumped too, from 10.4% to 11.1% this morning. That follow\u2019s Tsipras\u2019s address to the Athens parliament, and also Alan Greenspan\u2019s prediction that Greece will exit the eurozone. LNG\u2019s Gary Jenkins adds: In my view the possibility of Greece leaving the eurozone has increased with this speech from 35% to 50%. This Wednesday\u2019s meeting of finance ministers will give us a good indication of whether or not Greece will remain in the eurozone. Over in Athens, the Greek stock market has opened with a rush of selling, sending the AGT index down over 4%. Bank shares are leading the selloff, dropping by around 8%. The selloff is triggered by Alexis Tsipras\u2019s no-holds-barred speech last night (see opening post for details) His insistence that Athens will abandon its bailout programme and seek a bridging loan appear to have fanned the fears that Greece will tumble out of the eurozone. Gary Jenkins, analyst at LNG Capital, sums up the mood: I think it is fair to say that the speech given by the Greek Prime Minister Mr Tsipras to his parliament was a long way from being conciliatory. He said that \u2018Our government\u2019s irreversible decision is to implement in full our pre-election pledges,\u2019 and that \u2018Our government is not entitled to ask for a bailout extension. We are not entitled to ask for an extension of a mistake.\u2019 He added that \u2018We will fulfil the Eurozones\u2019s rules but we will not agree to unreasonable budgetary primary surpluses.\u2019 Just for good measure he added that he would ask for World War II reparations from Germany and increase the minimum wage. While Greece flails under the yoke of austerity, Germany has exported more goods than ever before. German seasonally-adjusted exports hit a record high in December, up by 3.4% month-on-month, data released this morning showed. There was bad news for foreign companies looking to sell to Germany \u2013 imports dropped by 0.8% month-on-month. That helped to push Germany\u2019s trade surplus to a record high. German firms look well-placed to profit from the weaker euro too, now the ECB has embarked on quantitative easing...... The next nine days are crucial for Greece. The government must win a confidence vote on Tuesday, then sell short-term debt on Wednesday. There are then three meetings with political leaders before next Wednesday, when the ECB decides whether to keep providing emergency liquidity to its banks. Credit Agricole analyst Fred Ducrozet suggests this timeline could put pressure on the new government to shift its position: The Mayor of London\u2019s top economic advisor, Dr Gerard Lyons, has endorsed the Greek government\u2019s plan to abandon the fiscal targets set by the Troika. European stock markets have fallen at the start of trading, as Greek crisis fears eat away at confidence. The French CAC, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB all shed around 1% at the open, while the FTSE 100 dropped 37 points, or 0.55%, to 6817 points. Investors will have noted the Greek finance minister\u2019s alarming comments yesterday. Yanis Varoufakis declared that the eurozone was a \u2018house of cards\u2019 that would collapse without Greece, and went on to claim that Italy\u2019s debt situation is \u201cunsustainable\u201d. That prompted Italy\u2019s finance minister to tweet back that the Italian debt was quite sustainable, thankyouverymuchYanis. Over in Istanbul, finance chiefs at the G20 summit are fretting that Greece and its creditors will fail to reach a deal. Timothy D. Adams, the president and chief executive of the Institute of International Finance, warned that time is running out. He told CNBC that both sides must stop playing to the galleries: \u201cI think there is still an opportunity for all sides to have a negotiation but I think (that is) narrowing pretty quickly so let\u2019s hope we can find a way through this,\u201d \u201cI think there is a way through this crisis but it requires cooler heads to prevail, (they need to) tone down the rhetoric and roll up their sleeves and get to work on a solution. I believe there is a solution but the rhetoric doesn\u2019t help.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout crisis, the eurozone, the world economy, the financial markets and business. The Greek debt crisis remains the biggest issue on the table this week, after Greece\u2019s prime minister raised the stakes with its creditors by insisting it will not stick to its old bailout deal. In a passionate address to the Athens parliament last night, Alexis Tsipras insisted that his government would deliver on its pre-election pledges, intensifying the crisis. Athens will not seek an extension when its existing bailout expires at the end of February, he said. Instead, he will seek a new \u201cbridge agreement\u201d to cover Greece\u2019s funding needs until June. As Helena Smith wrote last night: \u201cWe see hope, dignity and pride returning to Greek citizens. Our obligation and duty is not to disappoint them,\u201d Tsipras told the 300-seat house. \u201cWe realise that negotiations [with foreign lenders] won\u2019t be easy \u2026 but we have faith in our struggle, because justice is on our side.\u201d Declaring his administration \u201ca government of national salvation\u201d, Tsipras said he would also pursue claims to win back from Germany wartime loans that Greece had been forced to make to Nazi occupiers. \u201cI can\u2019t overlook what is an ethical duty, a duty to history \u2026 to lay claim to the wartime debt.\u201d Full story: Tsipras favours Greek jobless over creditors in defiant policy speech Tsipras\u2019s speech has blown away any expectations that the Athens government might cave in, after failing to make much obvious progress during last week\u2019s tour of European capitals. There\u2019s little sign of enthusiasm for a bridging loan among Greece\u2019s partners in the eurozone; on Friday, the head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, declared \u201cWe don\u2019t do bridging loans.\u201d It\u2019s heading towards a major clash.....as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: If investors were hoping for a more emollient tone from the new Greek government in light of last week\u2019s events, and the ECB\u2019s intervention in removing its collateral waiver, they were in for a rude awakening as PM Tsipras reinforced his determination to end the bailout at the end of this month, insisting on some form of bridging finance, as well as a determination to \u201chonour and fully implement our pre-election policy commitments, fully respecting the will of the people\u201d The speech sets the scene for another crunch week in the long-running financial crisis. Finance ministers and central bank chiefs are gathered in Istanbul today for talks on the global economy; on Wednesday eurozone finance ministers hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss Greece, and then European leaders hold a summit on Thursday. And with former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan predicting a Grexit, and UK chancellor George Osborne stepping up Britain\u2019s preparations for a crisis, the situation could easily escalate again this week. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day, as usual....",

But he was also clear-headedly optimistic. </p> <p>\u201cI cannot possibly separate the fate of Greece from the fate of Europe\u2026 We are perfectly capable as Europeans to mess things up unnecessarily.

      "bodyText": "Apart from Stephen Green there are five other former senior bankers caught up in the scandal that has engulfed HSBC, one of the world\u2019s biggest banks, following the leak of its Swiss operation\u2019s secret customer list. Sir John Bond, Stuart Gulliver, Clive Bannister, Chris Meares and Peter Braunwalder were involved in either acquiring, overseeing or managing HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank, which helped clients conceal assets from taxman. HSBC\u2019s present leaders now describe the Swiss bank as an operation with \u201ccompliance and control failures\u201d, where individuals \u201ctook advantage of bank secrecy to hold undeclared accounts\u201d, and which took on \u201chigh-risk\u201d customers. Four of them have since left HSBC, and none want to talk about it. Confronted with the evidence of misconduct at the Swiss subsidiary, each has remained silent. Sir John Bond It was Sir John Bond who took the decision to purchase the Swiss bank in 1999. These were the banking boom years, and Bond was on a spending spree, snapping up Edmond Safra\u2019s Republic National Bank of New York together with its Swiss arm. Safra, who built up the business, had died in a Monaco fire. Bond\u2019s newly acquired Swiss operation now sought fresh customers from South Africa, Ireland, the UK, the Middle East, France, Italy and Germany, while retaining many existing customers from Israeli families, Safra\u2019s early client base. When the news originally surfaced early in 2010 that there had been a leak at HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank, it caused consternation. As the wall of secrecy cracked, depositors fled. In Belgium, scores of diamond dealers were raided by the authorities. In Spain, the Bot\u00edn family, who head Santander bank, were forced to pay back taxes. French examining magistrates and the US Department of Justice both began to swing into action. Bond left in 2006 at the age of 65. He went on to chair Vodafone and Xstrata. Stuart Gulliver Stuart Gulliver, handed the job of chief executive in 2010, was faced with the problem. Gulliver, who had become one of the world\u2019s best rewarded investment bankers with a salary in excess of \u00a310m, had himself been on the board of the bank\u2019s private banking division, HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA from 2007 on. But he and the bank maintain that the Swiss arm, although part of the private banking division, was an independent, even maverick, operation. Swiss bank secrecy laws reigned supreme, they say. As alarm grew at HSBC\u2019s London HQ, plans were made for the toxic parts of the Geneva bank to be quietly dumped. A unit that had specifically targeted diamond dealers was shut down. The Chinese business was shifted to HSBC\u2019S Asia-Pacific division in Singapore and Hong Kong, and many of the remaining European clients in Switzerland were sold off for an undisclosed price in 2014 to LGT bank in Liechtenstein. Clive Bannister &amp; Chris Meares Two other British executives, Clive Bannister (top), succeeded in 2006 by Chris Meares, ran the worldwide private banking operation day by day. HSBC insists its group operated under a federal structure, with local subsidiaries enjoying varying degrees of autonomy. But executives were proud of the Swiss operation. Meares publicly applauded at the time its \u201cvery strong performances\u201d, with \u201crecord profits\u201d. He also assured the UK parliament\u2019s Treasury committee in 2008: \u201cWe prohibit our bankers from encouraging or being involved in tax evasion. If our bankers, sitting in London say, get any hint that there is tax evasion \u2026 If they have a suspicion that it is happening, then we file a suspicion transaction report to the authorities.\u201d Bannister left in 2010 and is now CEO of Phoenix Group, a life insurance company. Meares left in 2011 and now chairs the London investment managers Quilter Cheviot. Peter Braunwalder The first manager of the actual Geneva bank was Sem Almaleh, who dated from Safra\u2019s time. He was succeeded in 2002 by Braunwalder, a Swiss who also holds a British passport. In the period 2005-7 covered by the leaks, Braunwalder was directly in charge. By December 2007, he boasted he had doubled deposits to \u00a378bn. Profits were running at \u00a3550m a year. Braunwalder left HSBC in 2008. He is now president of the Swiss dental implant company Thommen Medical. But the bank\u2019s IT specialist, Herv\u00e9 Falciani, had already hacked the files by then and made off to France, and eventually Spain, where he lived under a witness protection scheme before eventually returning to France. HSBC was already in the firing line. Following a withering US Senate committee report, the bank paid a massive $1.9bn in penalties in the US in 2012 for effectively helping launder Mexican drug cash. It says this was an inadvertent failure of controls. The US explicitly declined to pursue a criminal prosecution against HSBC over its Mexican misconduct, on the grounds the bank was too big to lose its licence and employed too many people. But now, as the bank admits, its Swiss unit is under criminal investigation in Europe for \u201corganised money-laundering\u201d. Not much remains behind now of HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA in Geneva and Zurich. It has lost 70% of its clients, either because they fled or because the bank got rid of them. HSBC piously told the public by 2013: \u201cAll over the world, we follow the letter, and also the spirit, of local laws and regulations.\u201d It did not mention the Swiss scandal. While others picked up the pieces, however, some had already stepped away from the bank. \u2022 Braunwalder left HSBC in 2008. He is now president of the Swiss dental implant company Thommen Medical. \u2022 Bannister left in 2010 and is now CEO of the Phoenix Group, a life insurance company. \u2022 Meares left in 2011 and now chairs the London investment managers Quilter Cheviot. \u2022 Bond left in 2006 at the age of 65. He went on to chair Vodafone and Xstrata.",

I am optimistic that we will reach a compromise with our European partners,\u201d he said after meeting the Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, in Vienna. But his comments came as sources close to the government in Athens said Greek negotiators would need a bridging loan lasting until at least August \u2013 two months longer than previously expected \u2013 to allow negotiations over a new bailout package. The growing sense of confusion in European capitals about Athens\u2019 demands for an overhaul of its 2010 debt deal has raised further fears that Greece may eventually be forced out of the eurozone. The Greek stock market dropped by almost 5% on Monday, leading to falls in Paris and Frankfurt. The falls followed a recovery last week as investors had sensed a more conciliatory tone from Athens. David Cameron convened a meeting of Cobra, the British government\u2019s emergency committee, to discuss UK preparations for a possible Greek exit from the euro. The one-hour meeting on Monday morning \u2013 attended by Foreign Office, Treasury, Downing Street and banking officials \u2013 examined the risk of contagion to the UK banking system if the Greeks were pushed out of the eurozone. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, a long-time critic of Greek attempts to break with the existing deal, said that if Greece wanted Berlin\u2019s help there needed to be a programme agreed with creditors, rather than the emergency assistance that Athens had called for. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand how they [Greece] want to do it,\u201d he added after arriving at a G20 meeting in Istanbul. The UK government spokesman stressed the need to be vigilant about the developments, but added that since 2012 the European banks had taken steps to ensure they were more resilient in the face of a further euro crisis. No 10 publicised Monday\u2019s Cobra meeting either because Cameron wants to put pressure on Berlin and Brussels to reach a deal with Greece or because he wants to highlight the continuing threat to the UK recovery posed by the eurozone crisis in an attempt to underline his government\u2019s perceived economic competence in contrast with Labour The chancellor, George Osborne, was not at the meeting because he was on his way to Turkey for a meeting of G20 finance ministers. On Monday, Tsipras said there was nothing to fear from renegotiating a deal after pledges by his government to crackdown on tax evasion and bring public finances further into balance. He said: \u201cThroughout its history the EU has had its ups and downs, and we have always found a solution.

What\u2019s more, car companies are doing little to protect you.</p> <p>Most cars now contain more than 50 separate electronic control units collecting vehicle data and improving performance; nearly all have wireless entry points that could act as a gateway for hackers.

      "bodyText": "Forget crowbars \u2013 all a hacker needs to break into your car is an iPad, according to a report released on Monday by Senator Edward Markey. What\u2019s more, car companies are doing little to protect you. Most cars now contain more than 50 separate electronic control units collecting vehicle data and improving performance; nearly all have wireless entry points that could act as a gateway for hackers. Almost all the cars on the market today are therefore vulnerable to \u201chacking or privacy intrusions\u201d, Markey said. The Massachusetts senator\u2019s investigation of 50 top car manufacturers including BMW, Chrysler, General Motors and Ford found their treatment and protection of such potentially sensitive technology and information to be \u201calarmingly inconsistent and incomplete\u201d. According to Markey, nearly 100% of cars on the market include wireless technologies that could pose vulnerabilities to hacking or privacy intrusions, while most automobile manufacturers are unaware of or unable to report on past hacking incidents. The senator also said security measures to prevent remote access to vehicle electronics are inconsistent and haphazard across all automobile manufacturers, and manufacturers are collecting large amounts of data on driving history and vehicle performance and distributing it to third parties, giving little information on how the data is used, how it is stored or for how long. Markey also said customers are often not explicitly made aware of data collection and, when they are, they often cannot opt out without disabling valuable features, such as navigation. Last November two auto manufacturing trade groups, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers, released a joint statement setting out voluntary privacy protection principles for the industry. Among the suggestions was a call for automakers to collect information \u201conly as needed for legitimate business purposes\u201d. Markey said the protections fell short in a number of key areas by not offering explicit assurances of choice and transparency. \u201cDrivers have come to rely on these new technologies, but unfortunately the automakers haven\u2019t done their part to protect us from cyber-attacks or privacy invasions. Even as we are more connected than ever in our cars and trucks, our technology systems and data security remain largely unprotected,\u201d said Markey, a member of the Senate\u2019s commerce, science and transportation committee. \u201cWe need to work with the industry and cybersecurity experts to establish clear rules of the road to ensure the safety and privacy of 21st-century American drivers.\u201d The senator\u2019s report follows an investigation by CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes which showed hackers taking control of a car via a laptop.

      "bodyText": "Not far from the Jet d\u2019Eau, the famous Lake Geneva fountain, a huge rooftop sign proudly declared: \u201cHSBC Private Bank\u201d. Money didn\u2019t just talk here: it shouted. But the actual facts of what went on inside No 2, Rue Dr-Alfred-Vincent were less well publicised. Through its revolving doors, a stream of visitors slipped in and then out again with packets of cash in untraceable banknotes. From information contained in leaked files from HSBC\u2019s Swiss subsidiary, the Guardian has been able to reconstruct a diary of a year in the life of HSBC\u2019s cash machine. Large cash transactions are a classic warning sign to bankers. But instead of blocking the withdrawals or even interrogating them, the bank repeatedly handed out packets of untraceable banknotes. Specialist UK tax barrister Jolyon Maugham says: \u201cWhy on earth would you travel to Switzerland to take out sterling in cash? Why would you not just ask the Swiss branch to wire the money to your bank account in the UK? I struggle to see an answer to that question that doesn\u2019t involve you wanting to obscure from the UK tax authorities the fact that you have money in a Swiss bank account.\u201d Only when these facts later leaked out did the bank reform. It says it now seeks to operate \u201cstrict controls\u201d on withdrawals of more than \u00a36,600. Day by day, throughout 2005, a succession of holders of numbered accounts arrived, from the UK, France, Germany, Scandinavia, the US, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands. They often emerged with currency of little use in Switzerland itself. These British pounds, euros, US dollars, even Danish krone, were for spending at home, or sometimes to buy villas and flats abroad. Some clients have been frank that they were dodging tax. Retired accountant Andrew Sebastian, who collected a total of \u00a350,000 cash that year, said that since the HSBC data leaked out, he had settled with HMRC for a payment of \u00a342,722. A British antiques dealer, Caroline Carrier, picked up \u00a312,000 cash in April and another \u00a312,000 in August. She told the Guardian the matter had been \u201csettled legally\u201d in 2010, and HMRC had now collected all the taxes due on her inherited account. Others have denied wrongdoing or offered no explanation for their withdrawals when contacted by the Guardian. In the absence of any explanation, it is not possible to assess whether the withdrawals were for legitimate purposes. Arlette Ricci, the Nina Ricci perfume heiress, had the equivalent of \u00a315m in Swiss accounts. The bank provided her with 10 packets of \u20ac7,500 each throughout 2005, totalling about \u00a360,000. She denies all wrongdoing. Jewellery trader Harry Fane, younger son of the Earl of Westmorland, who had a total of up to \u00a3700,000 in HSBC Swiss accounts, confided to the bank that he wanted large sums of cash \u201cto fund ongoing building work on his property in London\u201d. His lawyer told the Guardian his financial affairs were private, had been conducted entirely lawfully, the accounts were now closed and no tax was outstanding on them. Hanne Tox, the widow of a Danish industrialist, did not respond to invitations to comment. She took away a total of 200,000 krone (about \u00a321,000), from a \u00a31.25m offshore trust account. According to the files, HSBC noted that all contact must go via a relative in London, \u201ccritical, as it is a criminal act having an account abroad non-declared\u201d. Another Dane who collected cash in Switzerland was meat trader Torben Lenzberg. Lenzberg\u2019s Danish phone number on the bank file is marked \u201cDO NOT CONTACT!\u201d This again could suggest the bank was aware of a clash with Danish law. HSBC says it has since banned its Swiss \u201chold mail service\u201d under which it kept all correspondence and made no giveaway phone calls. Lenzberg has not commented. Another Briton, recorded as having a \u00a32m share in an inherited trust fund, went half a dozen times to the bank\u2019s Zurich branch. She collected \u00a370,000 over the year, insisting she wanted British low-denomination \u201cused notes\u201d. With untraceable cash, tax returns become voluntary. Former tax inspector Richard Brooks told the Guardian: \u201cIf you withdraw cash from a bank in Geneva or Zurich, there\u2019s no trail of that over here. Most rich individuals will get their accountants to fill in their tax returns. They\u2019ll be working from their banking records. But there\u2019s nothing for your accountant to see.\u201d One particularly large handover by the bank of $100,000 (\u00a366,000) to Swiss tax-resident diamond trader Beny Steinmetz was accompanied by an innocent explanation. He told the bank it was for travel expenses and fuel for trips to South Africa and Russia. (He says he fully complied with all applicable laws). Eufemiano Fuentes, a Spanish doctor, later to be convicted of sports doping, whose offshore funds came from illegal doping of racing cyclists, withdrew a total of \u20ac265,000 in cash in the course of the year, claiming it was to buy a boat and to pay hospital bills for his daughter. More normal withdrawals were equivalent to \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000 a time. The UK cash pilgrims also included property traders, a diet clinic owner and a toy manufacturer. In one ingenious racket, HSBC manager Nessim Elmaleh pleaded guilty in 2013 to a deft laundering operation in which wealthy HSBC clients in Paris would get untraceable cash generated from the proceeds of big drug deals in the city. Elmaleh would reconcile the payments by transferring funds from the clients\u2019 accounts to those of the drug kingpins. The files show the bank reassuring another Briton who collected \u00a330,000 in cash \u201cin a hurry\u201d, HSBC noted. \u201cHe was under the impression that the Swiss banking secrecy was being lifted and the family are therefore trying to remove their assets. I informed them that this was not the case and that they had no need to reduce their account so quickly.\u201d The British owner of a furniture store in central London made clear his unlawful intentions. According to the leaked files, he said: \u201cWhat is the point of having money \u2018offshore\u2019 if one cannot have access to it?\u201d The bank said he wanted \u201cto have someone who would bring cash to him in the UK. He is not interested in the service that we could possibly provide him at HSBC Premier in Knightsbridge, as he would have to identify himself by passport! He said, \u2018I do know banks in your part of the world who are able to provide this service, using \u2026 their representative in Panama to bring in cash.\u2019\u201d But HSBC managers refused to courier such cash themselves across borders. They told him instead that they were prepared to offer \u201cpassive\u201d, but not \u201cactive\u201d assistance. Despite its self-protective caution, HSBC does however appear to have tipped its customers off to behaviour that might alert the taxman. In another case, a banker said two clients \u201casked about taking cash into the UK. I told them that the \u2018limit\u2019 was \u00a310,000 \u2013 information obtained from HSBC Compliance in London who had spoken to HM Customs in 2003\u2026 If a person with funds in excess of \u00a310,000 is stopped by HM Customs he had better have the right answers.\u201d The evidence of a pattern of misconduct is supported by the outcome of court cases in the US and Europe. Months before the IRS formally received the leaked HSBC Swiss data, US surgeon Andrew Silva admitted in 2010 that HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank deliberately gave him \u201cbricks\u201d of $100,000 in notes, to secretly post home in a series of envelopes. According to court papers, the bank told its client not to wire money because that would \u201ccreate a trail for US authorities\u201d. In a 2013 US prosecution, Vaibhav Dahake, a New Jersey businessman, similarly admitted HSBC bankers warned him not to carry in more than $10,000 in illegal funds, but to \u201cstay below the radar\u201d. US attorney Paul Fishman said at the time: \u201cBankers should encourage their clients to comply with the law, not advise them how to break it.\u201d",

He is not interested in the service that we could possibly provide him at HSBC Premier in Knightsbridge, as he would have to identify himself by passport! He said, \u2018I do know banks in your part of the world who are able to provide this service, using \u2026 their representative in Panama to bring in cash.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But HSBC managers refused to courier such cash themselves across borders.

      "bodyText": "Politicians must focus on policies to ensure that stronger economic growth goes hand in hand with fairer distribution of the financial gains if they are to stem rising inequality, a leading economic thinktank has said. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) made its comments on the potentially harmful effects of some pro-growth policies as finance ministers from the G20 group of nations convened in Istanbul to discuss plans to shore up the global recovery. Analysing the effects of pro-growth policies on inequality, the Paris-based organisation identified widening gaps in wealth distribution in many rich nations, with the poorest hardest hit. The OECD urged governments to prioritise policies that help reduce inequality while also boosting growth, such as more education for low-skilled workers and measures to get more women into work. The recommendations, part of the thinktank\u2019s annual Going for Growth report, were unveiled in Istanbul on the first day of the G20 finance ministers\u2019 meeting. They gather as concerns grow that a standoff between Greece and its international creditors could blow up into a fresh eurozone crisis with repercussions around the world. The OECD suggestion that some pro-growth policies have widened inequality will further fuel the heated debate over how countries can best restore sustainable economic growth six years after the global financial crisis. \u201cThe financial crisis and continued subdued recovery have resulted in lower growth potential for most advanced countries, while many emerging-market economies are facing a slowdown,\u201d says the report. \u201cIn the near term, policy challenges include persistently high unemployment, slowing productivity, high public-sector budget deficit and debt, as well as remaining fragilities in the financial sector. The crisis has also increased social distress, as lower-income households were hit hard, with young people suffering the most severe income losses and facing increasing poverty risk.\u201d The report comes as Greece\u2019s new leftwing government argues that relentless cuts under the terms of its bailout package have stifled the economy and caused widespread hardship. The OECD report highlights large increases in income inequality and poverty in Greece, alongside other countries hit hard by the crisis: Iceland, Ireland and Spain. Overall, the thinktank is gloomy about inequality trends across its 34 member countries. \u201cIncome inequality has increased in a majority of OECD countries since the mid-1990s. Households\u2019 disposable income has grown by less than gross domestic product (GDP), and income of the poorest households by less than that of the richest,\u201d the report says. The analysis echoes a series of recent warnings that inequality will worsen as labour markets polarise into high-skilled and low-skilled jobs with many mid-level roles being replaced by machines. The analysis of pro-growth policies found three main patterns. Some contributed to \u201ctechnology inequality\u201d, such as reforms that boosted innovation. Other policies that promoted labour force participation and job creation widened wage dispersion, but there was an offsetting effect of higher employment. Finally, a number of changes, such as better access to education, \u201cunambiguously reduce wage dispersion and/or household income inequality\u201d, the report said. It concludes: \u201cGiven the need in many countries to tackle rising inequalities, priority should be given to policy packages which both reduce income dispersion and boost growth. Especially important is raising the earnings potential of the low-skilled and promoting the labour force participation of women.\u201d The thinktank\u2019s annual overview of structural changes for each OECD country urges policymakers to push on with those in areas such as labour markets and taxation or else risk a \u201cvicious circle\u201d of low demand and low growth. The OECD secretary-general, Angel Gurr\u00eda, said during a launch event in Istanbul that although the changes were hard to enact, they were a crucial part of boosting growth. He said, however, that those that cut inequality should be prioritised. \u201cWe still see structural reforms combined with effective fiscal and monetary policy as part of an essential trilogy to boost growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pursuit of comprehensive reform strategies can be one of the keys to addressing rising inequalities and the lingering social consequences of the crisis. \u201cImplementing reforms that raise the job opportunities and earnings potential of low-skilled workers, help young people get a step on the job ladder and improve the labour market opportunities of women will unlock growth potential in our economies and ensure that it is shared by all.\u201d The OECD\u2019s chief economist, Catherine Mann, noted a \u201cslowdown in the pace of structural reforms observed across a majority of OECD countries over the past two years\u201d. She said some of that stemmed from rising concerns about inequality and a drop in popular support for a \u201cpro-growth reform agenda\u201d. \u201cThese are legitimate concerns. In some of the countries hardest-hit by the crisis, substantial labour market reforms aimed at restoring competitiveness have been introduced without commensurate and parallel efforts in product markets and without the availability of fiscal resources to cushion the social impact. \u201cThe result has been severe job and income losses, hurting young people the most. More broadly, there are indications that the most vulnerable households have been losing ground since the crisis across a majority of OECD countries,\u201d she wrote in the report. \u201cYet, a slowdown in the pace and breadth of reforms carries a bigger risk. That is of letting a vicious circle develop, whereby weak demand undermines potential growth, the prospects of which in turn further depress demand, as both investors and consumers become risk averse and prefer to save.\u201d Other recommendations for governments include making the most of current low borrowing costs to invest in infrastructure, cutting barriers to entrepreneurship and research and development, and promoting cross-border trade and investment. For the UK, the OECD urges more action to improve education outcomes. \u201cStudent performance is below the OECD average and is uneven across social groups,\u201d the report says. It also calls on the UK to strengthen employment programmes, noting that spending on active labour market policies is \u201csignificantly below\u201d the OECD average and that the share of young people not in employment, education or training (neets) is relatively high. It also recommends improving the planning regime and public infrastructure. The OECD launches its Going for Growth report",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Accompanied by a hired bodyguard, Richard Caring, British clothing tycoon and restaurateur, stepped out of his Geneva bank on a warm September day in 2005 with 5m Swiss francs in cash \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a32.25m ($3.4m) \u2013 enough to fill a suitcase. It was a transaction concealed, or so HSBC\u2019s bankers believed at the time, behind an impenetrable wall of Swiss secrecy. This mysterious event is now revealed in the leaked HSBC files and it demonstrates the way the bankers were willing at the time to hand over very large cash sums to their offshore customers. Richard Brooks, an ex-tax inspector and author of The Great Tax Robbery, told the Guardian: \u201cBanks are supposed to fill in suspicious activity reports for such transactions.\u201d He added: \u201cIn the UK I don\u2019t think you would be allowed to withdraw that kind of cash.\u201d LHSBC, which now admits past wrongdoing and lax controls at its Swiss banking arm, says it has since reformed such cash payments, making it possible to refuse them, and bringing in new \u201cstrict controls on withdrawals over [\u00a36,600]\u201d. The Guardian asked Caring, owner of the Ivy restaurant in London, who in Switzerland was to receive this untraceable cash consignment, and why. He would not explain. His lawyers said: \u201cIt is a private matter in which there was no impropriety on our client\u2019s part.\u201d The bank did not record on Caring\u2019s file who in Switzerland was to receive the cash. It recorded only that Caring said he planned to deposit it in \u201ca new a/c with a separate institution in Geneva \u2026 He did not feel it appropriate for either bank to be aware of the relationship with the other\u201d. In internal memos, HSBC displayed concern about handing over the banknotes, but sought to justify its behaviour by recording: \u201cRC goes to great lengths to maintain discretion.\u201d Caring had recently, in July 2005, made clear that if he was crossed by the bank, he was prepared to take away his lucrative business. HSBC had previously objected to a currency shortfall on an account. There was \u201ca lengthy and challenging conversation\u201d as a result, the bank noted. \u201cIt would be possible for him to send funds from Monaco at a moment\u2019s notice, should we insist. However, they would be accompanied by instructions to close the account. He expects us to consider his global relationship.\u201d The bank was anxious, as it put it, \u201cto bring this relationship back on track and to try to repair some of the damage\u201d. It believed Caring was worth up to \u00a3500m ($762m) worldwide. Some weeks later, on Monday 5 September, he summoned an HSBC banker to his London office near Euston station, and demanded that he authorise the \u00a32.25m payment, to be handed over to him in Swiss francs, in Switzerland. \u201cHe is extremely valued,\u201d the Swiss bankers wrote. But they at first demurred: \u201cRC is fully aware that his request is exceptional, particularly in view of the amount involved. He stressed, however, that he has an extensive relationship with the Group \u2026 and that all his dealings have been conducted entirely correctly over the years.\u201d HSBC added: \u201cHe stressed \u2026 due to his non-UK domicile status \u2026 he holds funds outside of the UK entirely legitimately.\u201d Caring is a UK-born citizen, who lives in London in a mansion known as the \u201cVersailles of Hampstead\u201d. But he claimed hereditary \u201cnon-domiciled\u201d tax status thanks to the US origins of his father, a former GI who settled in London after the war. This quirk enabled Caring not to disclose the existence of his Swiss or Monaco accounts to the UK tax authorities, and legally to avoid taxes on his capital held there. The bank made a point of noting that Sir John Bond, the main bank group chairman and other top executives, were personal acquaintances of Caring. (There is no suggestion Bond was aware of the cash transaction.) The head of the Swiss bank himself, Peter Braunwalder, eventually gave the go-ahead with \u201cour exceptional agreement to this request\u201d. Caring\u2019s lawyers told the Guardian there were \u201cinternal administrative procedures \u2026 to check the legitimacy of the transaction and avoid money-laundering\u201d. The bank had been satisfied with his explanation, they said. According to the bank\u2019s files, the funds for the cash handover originated from accounts in the tax haven of Monaco secretly controlled by Caring, but held under the name of Tina Green, wife of the Topshop billionaire Sir Philip Green. Caring was one of his major suppliers, and a close personal friend. The bank recorded: \u201cAs we know, until now [Caring] has hesitated from holding the vast majority of his cash assets in his own name, preferring to accept the offer of Mrs Green that she holds them in trust on his behalf.\u201d There is no suggestion either of the Greens knew about the consignment of cash, or broke any laws. The bank noted that Caring\u2019s offshore accounts, containing more than \u00a3100m ($152m), were, among other things, husbanding profits from an \u201canonymous\u201d 22% holding in BHS, part of Green\u2019s fashion empire. Neither Caring nor Green will say why the BHS investment was concealed in this way. Caring insists that he himself has always paid all due taxes on time, including \u00a333m ($50m) UK tax on dividends he received from BHS. Green, a supporter of David Cameron and a government adviser on \u201cefficiency\u201d, has come under fire from tax campaigners. A huge \u00a31.17bn ($1.78bn) dividend from his companies was paid at this time, apparently minimising tax, to his wife in Monaco, who is registered as their main beneficial owner. Caring, currently a \u00a3413,000 ($629,000) donor to the Conservatives and previously a lender of \u00a32m to Labour, used his access to offshore funds in 2005 to splash out on the purchase of a string of restaurants and clubs, including London\u2019s favourite celebrity haunt the Ivy, Belgo, Soho House and Wentworth golf course. He made showy charitable gestures, including a charityball in a palace in St Petersburg. He handed over $1m (\u00a3650,000) for Bill Clinton to attend in fancy dress, paid to the former US president\u2019s foundation. HSBC said it was not allowed by Swiss bank secrecy laws to discuss individuals. In a statement it said the Swiss bank\u2019s past \u201ccompliance culture and standards of due diligence \u2026 were significantly lower than they are today\u201d. HSBC said it had since introduced a tax transparency initiative under which \u201camended terms and conditions allowed the private bank to refuse a cash withdrawal request, and placed strict controls on withdrawals over US$10,000\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Accompanied by a hired bodyguard, Richard Caring, British clothing tycoon and restaurateur, stepped out of his Geneva bank on a warm September day in 2005 with 5m Swiss francs in cash \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a32.25m ($3.4m) \u2013 enough to fill a suitcase.</p> <p>It was a transaction concealed, or so HSBC\u2019s bankers believed at the time, behind an impenetrable wall of Swiss secrecy.

He would not explain. His lawyers said: \u201cIt is a private matter in which there was no impropriety on our client\u2019s part.\u201d</p> <p>The bank did not record on Caring\u2019s file who in Switzerland was to receive the cash. It recorded only that Caring said he planned to deposit it in \u201ca new a/c with a separate institution in Geneva \u2026 He did not feel it appropriate for either bank to be aware of the relationship with the other\u201d.</p> <p>In internal memos, HSBC displayed concern about handing over the banknotes, but sought to justify its behaviour by recording: \u201cRC goes to great lengths to maintain discretion.\u201d</p> <p>Caring had recently, in July 2005, made clear that if he was crossed by the bank, he was prepared to take away his lucrative business. HSBC had previously objected to a currency shortfall on an account. There was \u201ca lengthy and challenging conversation\u201d as a result, the bank noted. \u201cIt would be possible for him to send funds from Monaco at a moment\u2019s notice, should we insist. However, they would be accompanied by instructions to close the account. He expects us to consider his global relationship.\u201d The bank was anxious, as it put it, \u201cto bring this relationship back on track and to try to repair some of the damage\u201d. It believed Caring was worth up to \u00a3500m ($762m) worldwide.</p> <p>Some weeks later, on Monday 5 September, he summoned an HSBC banker to his London office near Euston station, and demanded that he authorise the \u00a32.25m payment, to be handed over to him in Swiss francs, in Switzerland. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e5e6264c423e246ee8e8dd155ea940b1bc26dc8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/8/1423405087455/5a9f256f-ccc0-44af-b08e-02981039c89e-288x420.jpeg\" alt=\"(from left) Richard Caring, Bill Clinton and Phillip Green at Caring\u2019s charity party in St Petersburg in 2005.\" width=\"288\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">(from left) Richard Caring, Bill Clinton and Phillip Green at Caring\u2019s charity party in St Petersburg in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe is extremely valued,\u201d the Swiss bankers wrote. But they at first demurred: \u201cRC is fully aware that his request is exceptional, particularly in view of the amount involved. He stressed, however, that he has an extensive relationship with the Group \u2026 and that all his dealings have been conducted entirely correctly over the years.\u201d</p> <p>HSBC added: \u201cHe stressed \u2026 due to his non-UK domicile status \u2026 he holds funds outside of the UK entirely legitimately.\u201d</p> <p>Caring is a UK-born citizen, who lives in London in a mansion known as the \u201cVersailles of Hampstead\u201d. But he claimed hereditary \u201cnon-domiciled\u201d tax status thanks to the US origins of his father, a former GI who settled in London after the war. This quirk enabled Caring not to disclose the existence of his Swiss or Monaco accounts to the UK tax authorities, and legally to avoid taxes on his capital held there.</p> <p>The bank made a point of noting that Sir John Bond, the main bank group chairman and other top executives, were personal acquaintances of Caring. (There is no suggestion Bond was aware of the cash transaction.) The head of the Swiss bank himself, Peter Braunwalder, eventually gave the go-ahead with \u201cour exceptional agreement to this request\u201d.</p> <p>Caring\u2019s lawyers told the Guardian there were \u201cinternal administrative procedures \u2026 to check the legitimacy of the transaction and avoid money-laundering\u201d.

There will be little change to petrol excise revenue. And while there will be companies whose profits (and thus tax) will be higher due to paying less for oil, this will be offset somewhat by the lower revenue from companies who produce oil and LNG (the price of LNG is linked to oil).</p> <p>It also notes that as production of LNG ramps up over the coming years, rises and falls in the oil prices will begin to have a greater impact upon both the economy and the budget.</p> <p>The impact of the falling iron ore prices on the budget, however, is expected to be much more of a concern.</p> <p>The RBA notes that in the past year the spot price for iron ore has fallen by 50%. </p> <p>Fortunately the falling value of the Australian dollar has lessened the fall in Australian dollar terms.</p> <p>Since November 2013 the price of iron ore has fallen by 55%, but because the value of our dollar has fallen as well in that time by 14%, the decline of iron ore prices in Australian dollars terms is just 47%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Iron ore price\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/vOGru/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That is still a horrendous fall, but at least the falling dollar also \u201coffsets some of the economic effects\u201d by \u201cstimulating demand\u201d in other industries such as manufacturing, tourism and education.</p> <p>The RBA also suggests that while falling iron ore prices would usually lead to falling household income and in-turn household expenditure, because of the \u201chigh level of foreign ownership of iron ore companies\u201d this impact is less than would be expected.</p> <p>But the hit on the budget of various governments is severe. </p> <p>In December, the Australian government revised down its estimates of the iron prices in it mid-year economic and fiscal outlook. It suggested an average price of $60 per tonne (minus freight).</p> <p>Treasury at the time estimated that \u201ca US$10/tonne reduction in the forecast iron ore spot price\u201d resulted in a \u201cdecline in tax receipts of $0.8bn in 2014-15 and $2.8bn in 2015-16\u201d.</p> <p>So it would cause Joe Hockey (and any other person who may at this point wish to be treasurer) conniptions that some analysts now tip iron ore prices to fall below $US40 a tonne.</p> <p>Rather nicely and subtly, the RBA in noting the declining iron ore prices pauses to give a bit of a slap to state and federal governments over the past decade.</p> <p>It concluded that \u201cduring the mining boom, governments responded to the increase in the tax base by lowering the average tax rate for households, and increasing expenditure and transfer payments\u201d \u2013 ie it cut taxes and increased family payments.</p> <p>But the RBA notes: \u201cAs the iron ore price has fallen from its peak, governments have chosen to offset lower tax and royalty receipts partly through fiscal restraint on current expenditures, such as transfer payments to households, and partly by increasing borrowing over the next few years.\u201d</p> <p>The suggestion that governments may have been too hasty to both cut taxes and also increase payments when the goings were good is left unsaid, but is certainly implied.</p> <p>With Hockey last week leaking to the Australian Financial Review that the budget surplus will be pushed back in the wake of further write-downs in revenue, and the political difficulty he has had with cutting family payments, he may well be one who rather ruefully thinks that the RBA is on the money.</p>",

It also notes that as production of LNG ramps up over the coming years, rises and falls in the oil prices will begin to have a greater impact upon both the economy and the budget. The impact of the falling iron ore prices on the budget, however, is expected to be much more of a concern. The RBA notes that in the past year the spot price for iron ore has fallen by 50%. Fortunately the falling value of the Australian dollar has lessened the fall in Australian dollar terms. Since November 2013 the price of iron ore has fallen by 55%, but because the value of our dollar has fallen as well in that time by 14%, the decline of iron ore prices in Australian dollars terms is just 47%. That is still a horrendous fall, but at least the falling dollar also \u201coffsets some of the economic effects\u201d by \u201cstimulating demand\u201d in other industries such as manufacturing, tourism and education. The RBA also suggests that while falling iron ore prices would usually lead to falling household income and in-turn household expenditure, because of the \u201chigh level of foreign ownership of iron ore companies\u201d this impact is less than would be expected. But the hit on the budget of various governments is severe. In December, the Australian government revised down its estimates of the iron prices in it mid-year economic and fiscal outlook. It suggested an average price of $60 per tonne (minus freight). Treasury at the time estimated that \u201ca US$10/tonne reduction in the forecast iron ore spot price\u201d resulted in a \u201cdecline in tax receipts of $0.8bn in 2014-15 and $2.8bn in 2015-16\u201d. So it would cause Joe Hockey (and any other person who may at this point wish to be treasurer) conniptions that some analysts now tip iron ore prices to fall below $US40 a tonne. Rather nicely and subtly, the RBA in noting the declining iron ore prices pauses to give a bit of a slap to state and federal governments over the past decade. It concluded that \u201cduring the mining boom, governments responded to the increase in the tax base by lowering the average tax rate for households, and increasing expenditure and transfer payments\u201d \u2013 ie it cut taxes and increased family payments. But the RBA notes: \u201cAs the iron ore price has fallen from its peak, governments have chosen to offset lower tax and royalty receipts partly through fiscal restraint on current expenditures, such as transfer payments to households, and partly by increasing borrowing over the next few years.\u201d The suggestion that governments may have been too hasty to both cut taxes and also increase payments when the goings were good is left unsaid, but is certainly implied. With Hockey last week leaking to the Australian Financial Review that the budget surplus will be pushed back in the wake of further write-downs in revenue, and the political difficulty he has had with cutting family payments, he may well be one who rather ruefully thinks that the RBA is on the money.",

As part of the company\u2019s commitment, the thousands of fluffy jumpers and angora coats and caps now sitting in its warehouses will be sent to Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The announcement comes after more than a year of talks with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), which had conducted an investigation into the production of the luxury fibre. In 2013, after visiting 10 angora farms in China, Peta released graphic footage showing fur being ripped out of live rabbits to ensure the angora fibres were as long and thick as possible. The rabbits, whose front and back paws were tied, screamed and writhed in pain as their fur was torn out. Bald and bleeding, the rabbits were pushed back into cramped cages to regrow their fur until it could be plucked again. The footage, said Peta, reflected the standard conditions for angora rabbits in China, which today is home to 90% of the angora fur trade. The Peta investigation prompted several retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, Topshop and Primark, to stop selling garments made from angora. In an about-face from its 2012 advert featuring Lana Del Rey clad in a light pink angora sweater, H&amp;M also said it would stop selling angora. Inditex, controlled by founder Amancio Ortega, one of the world\u2019s richest people with an estimated $63bn (\u00a341bn) fortune, initially stayed quiet. After a petition urging an end to global angora sales gathered more than 300,000 signatures online, the retailer said it would suspend its orders until it could verify that its supplier farms were in compliance with company requirements. Now the company has told the Guardian it will not be resuming its sales of angora. \u201cWe found no evidence of cruel practices at the farms providing angora wool to our suppliers,\u201d Inditex said. \u201cBut after consultation with animal welfare organisations to explore more sustainable ways to produce angora and help develop better standards within the industry, we have decided that banning angora production was the right decision.\u201d The Inditex statement was welcomed by Peta. \u201cInditex is the largest clothing retailer in the world.
