Poundland\u2019s products run from batteries to cleaning fluid to screwdrivers to reading glasses to sweets. If Woolworths had been half as efficient it would still be in business. The breadth of the offer ought to have persuaded the Competition and Markets Authority that Poundland\u2019s proposed \u00a355m takeover of smaller rival 99p Stores would be good for competition. A bigger Poundland \u2013 adding 250 stores in the UK to the current 550 \u2013 should cause slightly more headaches for the likes of B&amp;Q, Boots, the supermarkets and others.

Nonsense. Almost every product Poundland sells is available at a large Tesco; that is decent protection against underhand attempts to tweak quality or product sizes. In the face of the CMA\u2019s initial ruling, Poundland has three choices. It can walk away from the deal; it can agree to shed 80 stores and proceed; or it can opt for an in-depth investigation.

If business folk think politicians\u2019 language is \u201cextreme and hyperbolic\u201d then \u201cyou want to hear what we hear from our constituents on the doorstep\u201d. Neither answer, one suspects, satisfied the questioner since the eternal plea from one corner in the business world is that politicians should change the tax laws if they are unhappy with current ones. But both politicians\u2019 appeal to common sense is not quite the cop-out it might seem. Aggressive tax avoidance can indeed be hard to define under the UK\u2019s overly complicated tax rules, even before some multinationals have explored the delights of Luxembourg. But most sensible people can identify dodgy practices when they see them. The directors of most companies, too, will know when they\u2019ve exploited loopholes unfairly.

      "bodyText": "There is a smokescreen around the IMF\u2019s thinking on the world economy at its spring meetings in Washington this week. Discussion of the UK\u2019s slowing recovery is largely absent, presumably because of obvious political sensitivities as the country gears up for polling day. Analysis of the situation in Europe is anodyne compared with previous years. The US, still suffering the after-effects of the financial crisis in the form of low business investment and faltering consumer spending, is given a clean bill of health. The words of deep concern have been reserved for the developing world, which is dogged by falling commodity prices, low investment, corruption or all three. Russia was described as a virtual basket case that will struggle to benefit from the lower value of the rouble. Brazil, which has suffered a severe drought and cut public spending to prevent spiralling debt, will suffer a recession this year. Growth in south-east Asia will slow in response to China\u2019s determination to restrict a rampant property market that has become a favoured investment vehicle for a newly rich Chinese middle class. Like the western powers, China also gets the kid-glove treatment. Its forecast growth rate conforms largely to the official Beijing figures that most City analysts believe are a fiction. Rather than the decline from 6.8% growth this year to 6.3% next year in the IMF\u2019s latest forecasts, the figures could be closer to half. Diana Choyleva of Lombard Street Research, a renowned China expert, said growth last year was 4.4%, well below the IMF\u2019s 7.4%. In her most recent report she said: \u201cDire data out of China are competing head-on with the Greek political drama as the most destabilising factor for the global economy and financial markets.\u201d According to the IMF neither the China slowdown nor the Greek crisis pose much of a threat to the global economy. Apart from the deterioration in developing countries, it highlights volatile markets as a cause for concern. The ups and downs of currencies on international exchanges make it difficult to plan. Commodity prices, which have tumbled over the last year, can be a matter of life and death in the developing world while in the west they have become another reason businesses refuse to invest. But there are deeper worries about the world economy that the IMF merely skates over. In recent years there has been a huge rise in savings across the globe and a commensurate increase in borrowing. That is because investing savings in business ventures would put the money at risk, so most want to lend the money \u2013 they get a guaranteed stream of interest payments and the likelihood, especially in the case of government debt, they will get their money back. Former US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke worries about the way these forces are distorting decision-making by governments and businesses. Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers, who argues that high debts and low wages have brought about a long period of stagnation, also asks deeper questions about why growth remains, in the IMF\u2019s words, mediocre. The IMF should join the debate and be a little more worried about the risks lurking in the economic undergrowth.",

Diana Choyleva of Lombard Street Research, a renowned China expert, said growth last year was 4.4%, well below the IMF\u2019s 7.4%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/04/world_economic_growth-zip/giv-3982LgDXsew8600C/\" data-alt=\"imf graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/04/world_economic_growth-zip/giv-3982LgDXsew8600C/\">imf graphic</a> </figure>  <p>In her most recent report she said: \u201cDire data out of China are competing head-on with the Greek political drama as the most destabilising factor for the global economy and financial markets.\u201d</p> <p>According to the IMF neither the China slowdown nor the Greek crisis pose much of a threat to the global economy.</p> <p>Apart from the deterioration in developing countries, it highlights volatile markets as a cause for concern. The ups and downs of currencies on international exchanges make it difficult to plan. Commodity prices, which have tumbled over the last year, can be a matter of life and death in the developing world while in the west they have become another reason businesses refuse to invest.</p> <p>But there are deeper worries about the world economy that the IMF merely skates over.</p> <p>In recent years there has been a huge rise in savings across the globe and a commensurate increase in borrowing.</p> <p>That is because investing savings in business ventures would put the money at risk, so most want to lend the money \u2013 they get a guaranteed stream of interest payments and the likelihood, especially in the case of government debt, they will get their money back.</p> <p>Former US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke worries about the way these forces are distorting decision-making by governments and businesses. Former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers, who argues that high debts and low wages have brought about a long period of stagnation, also asks deeper questions about why growth remains, in the IMF\u2019s words, mediocre. The IMF should join the debate and be a little more worried about the risks lurking in the economic undergrowth.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Greece has vigorously rebutted speculation that it will declare a debt default and plunge out of the eurozone if it fails to strike a deal with lenders to keep its bankrupt economy afloat. Acknowledging that the Syriza-led anti-austerity government had faced the \u201cteething problems\u201d of any administration new to power, the minister tasked with overseeing the country\u2019s international economic relations expressed confidence that a deal with creditors would be reached even if negotiations went to the wire. \u201cI can assure you we are working flat out for the good scenario,\u201d said deputy foreign minister Euclid Tsakalotos. \u201cI am absolutely confident an agreement will be reached on 24 April. Deals are always done five or three or one minute before midnight, it\u2019s not unusual that they should go right to the brink.\u201d In what is widely seen as a make-or-break date for the debt-stricken nation, eurozone finance ministers have said they will pass judgment on the reform package Athens has been told to submit next week when they gather in the Latvian capital, Riga, on 24 April. With the country facing a series of debt repayments in May and June \u2013 when its existing bailout agreement ends \u2013 and the Greek economy forced to survive on emergency funding from the European Central Bank, failure to endorse the proposals could spell disaster for the continent\u2019s most indebted state. The reform-for-cash deal, an interim accord before Greece signs up to an anticipated third bailout later this year, would unlock \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.2bn) in financial assistance withheld since August as Athens has argued with creditors at the European Union, ECB and International Monetary Fund over the extent of austerity measures required to release aid. In the 10 weeks since prime minister Alexis Tsipras assumed power, the state of the economy has become ever more perilous as the government has struggled to meet debt obligations and keep up with public sector pensions and salaries while surviving on ever-waning reserves of credit. On Monday, the Financial Times reported that Greece was poised to take the dramatic step of declaring a debt default \u2013 a move that would almost certainly lead to the closure of Greek banks and imposition of capital controls \u2013 citing an unnamed official as saying the cash-starved country had \u201creached the end of the road\u201d. But Tsakalotos, an Oxford-educated economics professor catapulted into office with Tsipras\u2019 far-left Syriza party, hit back, saying the criticism was wholly unfair. Many of the reports emanated from Germany, the main provider of Greece\u2019s \u20ac240bn bailout programme, and other countries that took an equally tough line on austerity. \u201cThere are some teething problems that one might expect from a young government without experience but we are concerned that there is quite a bit of unfair criticism about the preparedness of the Greek government and its ability to provide details on its ambitious reform programme,\u201d he said. A deal would be reached if creditors did not continue to insist on the new administration implementing reforms that even the previous pro-bailout premier, Antonis Samaras, found impossible to enforce. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think they will do that,\u201d said Tsakalotos, adding that despite all the criticism the leftists were avowedly pro-European. \u201cThis is a government that is systemically pro-European, not just tactically pro-European and that\u2019s because we believe that the break-up of the euro will lead to right-wing nationalism and competitive devaluation, a straight re-run of the 1930s that no progressive person would want.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Poundland sales hit \u00a31bn as it mulls over deal for 99p Stores", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Poundland has reported annual sales of more than \u00a31bn for the first time as discounters pass another milestone in their transformation of the British high street . From a single shop in Burton-on-Trent, the one-price chain has grown to 600 stores with a turnover on a par with more established names like WHSmith and more than double Mothercare\u2019s. Poundland said it sold more than 1bn items priced at \u00a31 - although it has been carpeted by the advertising watchdog for selling some products at more than a pound - with its top ten sellers including cotton buds, Cadbury\u2019s Milk Tray and aluminium foil. Retail industry experts say the emergence of Poundland, Aldi and Lidl as powerful retail brands has confirmed the impact of austerity and squeezed living standards on shopping tastes. Poundland passed the \u00a31bn mark a week after Aldi overtook Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s sixth-largest supermarket chain. \u201cDiscounters have always been part of the retail scene, catering for people who didn\u2019t have a lot of money,\u201d said Clive Black, retail analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital. \u201cWhat happened was that in 2011 the UK became a country that didn\u2019t have a lot of money and bargain hunting became a national pastime and not just the preserve of people on low incomes.\u201d As the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s retrench by closing stores and mothballing sites, Poundland has ambitious plans to reach 1,000 outlets in the UK and Ireland and to expand in Europe, starting in recession-battered Spain. A deal to buy rival chain 99p Stores could add 250 stores in one go, though the competition regulator has said it is unhappy about overlapping stores in 80 places. Even without the 99p Stores deal, Poundland is growing strongly, reporting a 12% rise in sales to \u00a31.1bn for the year to March 29, with analysts predicting profits of around \u00a344m. With real wages finally starting to rise and the economy growing, the retailer believes its one-price policy will hold firm despite the return of the feelgood factor for shoppers. Jim McCarthy, Poundland\u2019s chief executive, said that its US counterpart Dollar Tree has been selling all items for a dollar or less for about twice the time Poundland has been trading. \u201cIt is much tougher to deliver that at a dollar than at a pound and that tells you there is longevity in this offer.\u201d Poundland launched 25 years ago when Steve Smith opened the first store in Burton-on-Trent with the help of a \u00a350,000 loan from his father. Smith, who became a multimillionaire when he sold the business in 2002, came across the idea for Poundland while helping out on his father\u2019s market stall in Bilston market in the west Midlands. He had seen shoppers snap up goods from a box of items with damaged packaging all priced at 10p. The company grew steadily to 100 stores by the early 2000s when it was sold for \u00a350m, which compares with its stockmarket valuation today of \u00a3830m. By 2006 there were 150 shops selling to mainly lower income customers. Better-off shoppers had little incentive to move downmarket at the peak of a long consumer boom. The great recession and the age of austerity were the making of Poundland. Rising unemployment, high household debts and soaring inflation for essential goods made bargain hunting a necessity for more people. Then it became fashionable as names such as Aldi, Lidl, Primark and B&amp;M came to the fore. Poundland said more than one in five of its customers is now from the affluent AB socioeconomic group. Well-heeled shoppers are happy to pull up to Poundland in a BMW or a Mercedes to look for deals, according to Shore Capital\u2019s Black. The sales figure for 2015 is three times the company\u2019s revenues for 2006. The top-line revenue growth of 12% has been fuelled by opening new stores but sales at branches open for a year or more rose 2.4%. Just as the discounters have helped eat into the big supermarkets\u2019 sales, Poundland is taking advantage by striking better deals that help it keep prices low. The big grocers are ordering less but Aldi and Lidl mainly sell their own brands so suppliers turn to Poundland, McCarthy said. McCarthy, who ran Sainsbury\u2019s convenience stores before switching in 2006, said: \u201cSuppliers are always interested in businesses that are growing. They like to deal with us because they get volume, we make quick decisions and they get paid on time and in full.\u201d Poundland also scours the world for deals it cannot get in the UK, including from the US and Asia. For example, it buys multipacks of Polo mints from Indonesia though that bit of dealmaking got the company bad press in 2008 when a store close to Nestle\u2019s Rowntree factory in York was found selling the sweets. McCarthy says keeping costs down is also an important part of his \u00a31 offer. Like other big retailers, the company has not signed up to the living wage. Two years ago, the supreme court ruled that a government scheme requiring Cait Reilly, a geography graduate, to work for free at Poundland was legally flawed. Some analysts have argued that the price paid by society for ultra-cheap goods is low wages and squeezed suppliers. But more than \u00a31bn of sales says the draw of a bargain is enduring. Black at Shore Capital said: \u201cThings will ebb and flow but the discount genie is out of the bottle and it isn\u2019t going back.\u201d Poundland\u2019s top 10 sellers Toblerone 170g Maltesers box 120g 10 plus 1 Kodak batteries Replay DVDs Johnson &amp; Johnson cotton buds Classic Finish dishwasher tablets - 10 pack Cadbury\u2019s Milk Tray Semi skimmed milk - 2 litre Aluminium foil Silksoft toilet roll",

      "body": "<p>Poundland has reported annual sales of more than \u00a31bn for the first time as discounters pass another milestone in their transformation of the British high street . </p> <p>From a single shop in Burton-on-Trent, the one-price chain has grown to 600 stores with a turnover on a par with more established names like WHSmith and more than double Mothercare\u2019s. Poundland said it sold more than 1bn items priced at \u00a31 - although it has been carpeted by the advertising watchdog for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/04/poundland-must-no-longer-claim-everything-it-sells-costs-1-says-asa\">selling some products at more than a pound</a> - with its top ten sellers including cotton buds, Cadbury\u2019s Milk Tray and aluminium foil. </p> <p>Retail industry experts say the emergence of Poundland, Aldi and Lidl as powerful retail brands has confirmed the impact of austerity and squeezed living standards on shopping tastes. Poundland passed the \u00a31bn mark a week after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/08/aldi-overtakes-waitrose-to-become-uks-sixth-largest-supermarket-chain\">Aldi overtook Waitrose</a> to become the UK\u2019s sixth-largest supermarket chain.</p> <p>\u201cDiscounters have always been part of the retail scene, catering for people who didn\u2019t have a lot of money,\u201d said Clive Black, retail analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital. \u201cWhat happened was that in 2011 the UK became a country that didn\u2019t have a lot of money and bargain hunting became a national pastime and not just the preserve of people on low incomes.\u201d</p> <p>As the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s retrench by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/28/tesco-names-43-stores-to-close\">closing stores</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/13/sainsburys-profit-new-supermarkets-write-off\">mothballing sites</a>, Poundland has ambitious plans to reach 1,000 outlets in the UK and Ireland and to expand in Europe, starting in recession-battered Spain.</p> <p><br></p> <p>A deal to buy rival chain 99p Stores could add 250 stores in one go, though the competition regulator has said it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/09/poundland-takeover-99p-stores-market-watchdog-low-price-chains\">unhappy about overlapping stores</a> in 80 places. Even without the 99p Stores deal, Poundland is growing strongly, reporting a 12% rise in sales to \u00a31.1bn for the year to March 29, with analysts predicting profits of around \u00a344m. </p> <p>With real wages finally starting to rise and the economy growing, the retailer believes its one-price policy will hold firm despite the return of the feelgood factor for shoppers. </p> <p>Jim McCarthy, Poundland\u2019s chief executive, said that its US counterpart Dollar Tree has been selling all items for a dollar or less for about twice the time Poundland has been trading.</p> <p>\u201cIt is much tougher to deliver that at a dollar than at a pound and that tells you there is longevity in this offer.\u201d</p> <p>Poundland launched 25 years ago when Steve Smith opened the first store in Burton-on-Trent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/10/poundland-ipo-founder-steve-smith\">with the help of a \u00a350,000 loan from his father</a>. Smith, who became a multimillionaire when he sold the business in 2002, came across the idea for Poundland while helping out on his father\u2019s market stall in Bilston market in the west Midlands. He had seen shoppers snap up goods from a box of items with damaged packaging all priced at 10p.</p> <p>The company grew steadily to 100 stores by the early 2000s when it was sold for \u00a350m, which compares with its stockmarket valuation today of \u00a3830m. By 2006 there were 150 shops selling to mainly lower income customers. Better-off shoppers had little incentive to move downmarket at the peak of a long consumer boom.<br></p> <p>The great recession and the age of austerity were the making of Poundland. Rising unemployment, high household debts and soaring inflation for essential goods made bargain hunting a necessity for more people. Then it became fashionable as names such as Aldi, Lidl, Primark and B&amp;M came to the fore.</p> <p>Poundland said more than one in five of its customers is now from the affluent AB socioeconomic group. Well-heeled shoppers are happy to pull up to Poundland in a BMW or a Mercedes to look for deals, according to Shore Capital\u2019s Black.<br></p> <p>The sales figure for 2015 is three times the company\u2019s revenues for 2006. The top-line revenue growth of 12% has been fuelled by opening new stores but sales at branches open for a year or more rose 2.4%.</p> <p>Just as the discounters have helped eat into the big supermarkets\u2019 sales, Poundland is taking advantage by striking better deals that help it keep prices low. The big grocers are ordering less but Aldi and Lidl mainly sell their own brands so suppliers turn to Poundland, McCarthy said.</p> <p>McCarthy, who ran Sainsbury\u2019s convenience stores before switching in 2006, said: \u201cSuppliers are always interested in businesses that are growing. They like to deal with us because they get volume, we make quick decisions and they get paid on time and in full.\u201d</p> <p>Poundland also scours the world for deals it cannot get in the UK, including from the US and Asia. For example, it buys multipacks of Polo mints from Indonesia though that bit of dealmaking got the company bad press in 2008 when a store close to Nestle\u2019s Rowntree factory in York was found selling the sweets.</p> <p>McCarthy says keeping costs down is also an important part of his \u00a31 offer. Like other big retailers, the company has not signed up to the living wage. </p> <p>Two years ago, the supreme court ruled that a government scheme requiring Cait Reilly, a geography graduate, to work for free at Poundland was legally flawed. </p> <p>Some analysts have argued that the price paid by society for ultra-cheap goods is low wages and squeezed suppliers. But more than \u00a31bn of sales says the draw of a bargain is enduring.</p> <p>Black at Shore Capital said: \u201cThings will ebb and flow but the discount genie is out of the bottle and it isn\u2019t going back.\u201d</p> <h2>Poundland\u2019s top 10 sellers</h2> <p>Toblerone 170g</p> <p>Maltesers box 120g</p> <p>10 plus 1 Kodak batteries</p> <p>Replay DVDs</p> <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson cotton buds</p> <p>Classic Finish dishwasher tablets - 10 pack</p> <p>Cadbury\u2019s Milk Tray</p> <p>Semi skimmed milk - 2 litre</p> <p>Aluminium foil</p> <p>Silksoft toilet roll</p>",

      "bodyText": "Centrica has recruited an insurance industry veteran with no experience in the energy sector as head of British Gas. Mark Hodges will take over at Britain\u2019s biggest domestic energy supplier on 1 June and will join Centrica\u2019s board. He will be paid an annual salary of \u00a3625,000, a bonus of up to twice that figure as well as up to three times his salary every year in shares under a long-term incentive plan \u2013 making the whole package worth up to \u00a33.75m a year. His appointment after an 11-month search by the company comes at a time of political and regulatory scrutiny. If Labour is the biggest party after the 7 May general election, Hodges could be thrown immediately into a political battle as Ed Miliband has promised to freeze household energy prices and shake up the industry to give consumers a better deal. Energy companies are also the subject of a Competition and Markets Authority inquiry. The regulator said in its initial findings that the big providers charged loyal, often vulnerable customers \u00a3200-plus a year more than those who shop around. Hodges quit abruptly after three years as the head of Towergate Insurance in October, a month before the company revealed it was struggling to stay afloat. The debt-laden broker sold itself to its senior creditors in February in a rescue deal. Hodges has spent his career in the insurance sector, but Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, said his work in a regulated industry and improving businesses qualified him for the job at British Gas. \u201cHe brings substantial experience of running a major UK customer-facing business and has a strong track record in improving customer service, increasing performance and driving growth through innovation. British Gas will benefit significantly from these capabilities,\u201d Conn said. \u201cMark is ideally suited to lead the business in this next phase.\u201d British Gas\u2019s operating profit fell by 20% to \u00a3823m in 2014 because of a sharp drop in demand during Britain\u2019s warmest year on record. The business also lost 368,000 customers, ending 2the year with 14.8 million. The slump contributed to Centrica\u2019s move to cut its dividend in February for the first time since it was created in 1997 as Conn, who took over the at the start of the year, attempted to maintain the company\u2019s credit rating. Hodges said he was looking forward to joining the business. Before joining Towergate, Hodges spent 20 years at Aviva, where he rose to run the company\u2019s UK business. He will take over from British Gas\u2019s interim boss Ian Peters, who has managed the business since Chris Weston left to run Aggreko last year. Angelos Anastasiou, a utilities analyst at Whitman Howard, said: \u201cThe appointment of Mark Hodges seems sensible and should complete the series of managerial changes that Centrica has seen over the past year or so, and it should allow chief executive, Iain Conn, to progress with the implementation of his strategy for Centrica, following the \u2018kitchen-sinking\u2019 that we believe was incorporated into the results in February.\u201d Centrica is scheduled to update the market on its current trading on 27 April \u2013 before the CMA\u2019s findings are published.",

      "bodyText": "Another mixed day for stock markets, writes Nick Fletcher, with European shares under pressure on continuing worries about Greece\u2019s finances as the latest deadline to reach a deal with its creditors approaches. Wednesday sees the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, with investors hoping an update on its quantitative easing programme will provide some support to the markets. But a revival in the mining sector saw the UK market buck the falling trend, while lower than expected US retail sales cast doubts again on an imminent rate rise from the Federal Reserve. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 10.96 points or 0.16% at 7075.26 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.9% to 12,227.60 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.69% at 5218.06 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 1.07% to 23,752.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.36% at 11,704 The Athens market fell 2.24% to 758.63 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently nearly 50 points or 0.3% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Investors are seriously underestimating the dangers that Greece\u2019s potential exit from the eurozone would pose to the rest of the region, warns Paul Donovan of Swiss bank UBS. He fears that the current rally in eurozone government bonds (which are now trading at record highs) has helped create a dangerous complacency. If Greece were to quit the eurozone, it could spark a major banking panic across the region as savers in other peripheral countries took out their savings just in case they were next. As Donovan puts it: The contagion risk after a possible Greek exit arises if bank depositors elsewhere in the Euro area believe that a physical euro note held \u201cunder the mattress\u201d at home today is worth more than a euro in a bank \u2013 because a euro in a bank might be forcibly converted into a national currency tomorrow. Donovan adds that \u201cThere are some important things to note here\u201d: \u0083 This is not a question of banking system solvency. Highly solvent banks will be subject to deposit flight if it is the value of the currency in that country that is uncertain. This is not a question of the fiscal strength of the government. The question is whether the government is willing to bear the cost of staying in the monetary union . This is not a question of bank depositors being certain of a monetary union breakup. The catalyst of deposit flight is likely to be triggered by the possibility of a breakup in the monetary union. Popular opinion is irrelevant (it is worth noting that a very sizeable majority of Greeks wish to remain in the Euro and this has not stopped deposits falling in that country). In dealing with one\u2019s assets the important driver of action is not what one wants to happen but what one fears might happen. The example of economic pain in Greece in the wake of an exit from the Euro is irrelevant. Depositors in other countries may recognise that exit from the monetary union is economically disastrous, but if they think there is any possibility that their own economy could be forced down that route then it is logical to withdraw deposits. Indeed, economic chaos in Greece after an exit may be an incentive to accelerate deposit withdrawal elsewhere. He also provides a chart, showing that Greek bank deposits tend to fall as anxiety over the crisis rises.... EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini doesn\u2019t share Olivier Blanchard\u2019s optimism that a Grexit would be manageable...... Olivier Blanchard, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s chief economist, has just told reporters that the eurozone could cope if Greece quit the single currency. Speaking at the press conference in Washington, Blanchard said that a Gexit would be very costly and painful, but not impossible to handle. There are better firewalls in place than in 2012, he pointed out, but obviously it wouldn\u2019t be smooth sailing. It feels like a nudge to Greece to finally deliver a credible reform package by next Monday, as its increasingly impatient creditors have asked. If the IMF forecasts are accurate, then Britain will be the second-fastest growing advanced nation this year (having been the fastest in 2014). Here\u2019s the full forecasts just released by the IMF: Here\u2019s another interesting chart from the IMF\u2019s new World Economic Outlook, showing the damage caused by the financial crisis: The IMF has also paid tribute to the European Central Bank, saying its QE stimulus programme appears to have \u201cstalled the decline in inflation expectations\u201d. But there\u2019s less love for Germany; just a nudge to do more to help its euro neighbours. The IMF has good news for the eurozone -- it has raised its growth forecast for the region in 2015 to 1.5%, up from 1.2% previously. It sees growth strengthening a little in 2016, to 1.6%. The weaker euro, and the fall in oil prices, should give European countries a boost, it believes. The Fund is still optimistic for Greece, too, despite the current crisis. Breaking: The International Monetary Fund has reiterated that global growth will pick up in 2015 and 2016, but warned that the recovery is \u201cmoderate and uneven\u201d. In its new World Economic Outlook, just released, the IMF stuck to its forecast of global growth of 3.5% this year, rising to 3.8% in 2016 (compared with 3.7% in its January forecasts). It has raised its forecast for Japan, but has downgraded its hopes for the US economy. The Fund has also warned that the global economy is vulnerable to shocks, following the 2008 financial crisis. As our economics correspondent Phillip Inman reports from Washington: The IMF.... warned that the \u201ccomplex forces\u201d that affected global activity in 2014 \u2013 including wild swings in exchange rates and collapsing commodity prices \u2013 were still shaping economic events. Longer-term issues have also depressed the \u201cproductive capacity\u201d of many countries, the IMF said, including large debt mountains and ageing populations in Europe, Japan and the US. Heads up: The International Monetary Fund will release its latest assessment of the world economy in 10 minutes time. Over to the US.... and the latest retail sales figures have just been released, and missed forecasts. Granted, sales jumped by 0.9% in March - the fastest rise in a year. But the dollar is weakening, because economists had expected a bigger bounceback. It bolsters the case that the US Federal Reserve might not raise interest rates until the autumn, or even later. A June rate hike was already looking unlikely, as this chart from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch shows: Time for a recap. Britain has avoided falling into negative inflation for the first time in over half a century. The Consumer Prices Index was unchanged year-on-year in March, the second month running of zero inflation in the UK. Food prices are down by 3.2% annually, while motor fuel prices have tumbled by 13.7%. Core inflation, which ignores such items, fell unexpectedly to a nine-year low of 0.9% - indicating that underlying inflationary pressures have weakened. The Office for National Statistics also found that clothing and footwear prices fell during March, the first monthly decline since they started calculating the CPI in 1996. Petrol prices, though, inched up during the month. Historic data shows that the CPI hasn\u2019t been negative since March 1960: Economists remain split on whether inflation will fall below zero in a month\u2019s time. But there\u2019s broad agreement that we are not heading into a deflationary spiral. Reaction starts here. UK chancellor George Osborne claimed the data showed the economy is in good health; Labour disagreed. For more, just scroll back to 9.30am -- or even better, read Katie Allen\u2019s story: Allan Monks of JP Morgan says there\u2019s a decent chance UK inflation will inch up this month: With petrol prices having risen in April, the currency falling, utility bill cuts largely passed through, and global agricultural commodity prices having stabilized, headline inflation could rise to 0.1% in April even as core weakens. We still see downside risk to our forecast for headline inflation, but March may have marked the trough in headline. And here\u2019s JPM\u2019s inflation forecasts, from a research note titled \u201cUK skirts deflation despite drag from womens clothing\u201d* * We\u2019ll do the puns, you do the thinking, ok? Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis will meet Barack Obama on Thursday, as the clock ticks towards Athens\u2019 next deadline. Greek newspaper eKathimerini reports: Varoufakis is in Washington for the Spring Meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund. He is expected at the White House on Thursday to attend celebrations for the March 25th Greek Independence Day celebrations, becoming the first official of the recently elected Greek government to meet with the US president. Sources say he will have a few moments to talk with Obama and US Vice President Joe Biden at a time when Greece is in crucial negotiations with its international creditors. Greece\u2019s creditors want to see a detailed list of reforms by next Monday, so finance ministers could discuss then and potentially release bailout funds on Friday 24th April. Back to Greece.... and European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has told the European Parliament that he\u2019s still waiting for a detailed reform list from Athens: One of the City\u2019s most pessimistic analysts, Albert Edwards of Societe Generale, has just warned that Britain\u2019s will face a currency crisis due to the large current account deficit. Living up to his reputation as a \u2018permabear\u2019, Edwards\u2019 latest report claims the UK was a \u2018ticking time bomb\u201d..... Here\u2019s my colleague Katie Allen on today\u2019s inflation data: It\u2019s a tale of two inflation rates, says former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance: Today\u2019s inflation report contains bad news for motorists, who may have got used to paying less at the pump. Average petrol prices rose by 3.8 pence per litre between February and March this year, suggesting that the boost from weaker oil prices has ended [Brent crude has risen during 2015, after tumbling in late 2014]. If fuel prices keep rising, then Britain\u2019s inflation rate may not fall below zero at all, says Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown. He adds: Falling inflation has largely been driven by falling fuel and food costs, and this should be positive for the economy. When the price of essential goods and services falls, it acts like a tax cut, boosting disposable incomes and allowing consumers to spend on other items. [Bank of England governor] Mark Carney has described the impact of cheaper oil prices as \u201cunambiguously good\u201d for the economy. This is a rather neat chart from the Economist Intelligence Unit: High street sales helped to keep inflation at zero, points out Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk: \u201cToday\u2019s confirmation that UK inflation has remained at zero is welcome news..... Although we are expected to return to inflation in the not too distant future, we\u2019re facing uncertain times and it\u2019s likely our flirt with deflation is not yet over.\u201d Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says Britain could be flirting with negative inflation for several months: \u201cWe expect inflation to remain close to zero until the latter months of this year, at which point the base effects, caused by the collapse in oil prices, will begin to kick in. But core inflationary pressures are likely to remain well contained, ensuring that inflation remains below the 2% target for a prolonged period. Therefore, while the threat of \u2018noflation\u2019 becoming entrenched looks low, there is equally little threat of inflation taking off. Let\u2019s hope \u2018noflation\u2019 catches on Inflation could turn negative by the summer, predicts Peter Cameron, assistant fund manager at Ecclesiastical Investment Management. He\u2019s not worried, though: \u201cInflation has remained at 0% this morning but could well fall negative in the next couple of months. The fall in inflation over the past year has been driven by declines in the prices of essential, everyday items like food and fuel. Therefore it is the equivalent of handing consumers a temporary tax cut through cheaper household bills. What we have not witnessed in the UK so far is the toxic form of deflation that occurs when people defer purchases of big ticket items on the idea that they will become cheaper in the future. As long as that is avoided, these inflation figures should be considered a positive for the UK economy and also provide more wriggle room for the Bank of England when determining when to begin raising interest rates\u201d. Reaction to today\u2019s inflation data is flooding in, so I\u2019ll round up the best quotes now.... ....starting with Joshua Raymond of City Index, who sees little chance of an interest rate rise soon: Clearly the UK remains on the cusp of deflation and this continues to put the Bank of England between a rock and a hard place when it comes to hiking interest rates. The threat of deflation is pushing market views for the BoE\u2019s first rate hike further out and whilst todays inflation reading will do little to change current forecasts, there were some fears we could see a deflationary print today. No prizes for spotting the trend: As flagged earlier, the UK\u2019s core inflation rate (ignoring food, fuel, tobacco etc) has hit a nine-year low of 1.0%. The two main political parties didn\u2019t waste seizing on today\u2019s inflation figures. Chancellor George Osborne (who saw the data yesterday) swiftly welcomed the news that CPI inflation remained at zero. But Chris Leslie, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, was predictably less impressed: \u201cA few months of falling world oil prices won\u2019t solve the deep-seated problems in our economy or make up for years of bills rising faster than wages. \u201cWages continue to be sluggish and are down \u00a31,600 a year on average under this government. And tax and benefit changes since 2010 have left families \u00a31,100 a year worse off on average. Britain\u2019s housing boom is slowing down, according to this morning\u2019s statistics. The ONS reports that average prices rose by 7.2% year-on-year in February, compared with 8.4% a month ago. London still outpaced the market, with prices up 9.4% year-on-year. But strip out the capital and the South East, and average prices were only up by 5.9%. Still faster than wage growth, but a sign that the market is cooling. According to the ONS: House price annual inflation was 7.4% in England, 1.1% in Wales, 6.4% in Scotland and 14.2% in Northern Ireland. Annual house price growth is showing signs of slowing across the majority of the UK. The full report is online here. Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon argues that deflation is not a threat: Hat-tip to Sky\u2019s Ed Conway for showing that UK inflation is at its lowest since the start of the swinging 1960s. UK retailers usually hike the cost of cardigans and shoes in spring, but not this year.. The cost of clothing and footwear fell month-on-month in March for the first time since the consumer prices index was created in 1996, according to the ONS. Here\u2019s how the inflation report explains it: Clothing and footwear: prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between February and March this year, compared with a rise of 1.8% between the same 2 months a year ago. This is the first time that prices have fallen between February and March since the CPI was introduced. Normally prices rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The downward contribution came from price movements for a range of women\u2019s outerwear, particularly trousers, dresses and cardigans. There was also a smaller downward effect from men\u2019s outerwear. This chart from the ONS shows how inflation has rocketed towards zero in the last year: And this chart confirms that food and transport costs were the biggest drag on the annual inflation rate last month. Eating out or getting educated cost more, though: Cheaper food and energy prices are the main reason why inflation remained at zero last month. The ONS says: In the year to March 2015, food prices fell by 3.2% and prices of motor fuels fell by 13.7%. In both cases, the falls were smaller than in the year to February but the 2 groups still provided the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate for March The pound has just fallen by half a cent against the US dollar, hitting $1.4614. I reckon that is because Britain\u2019s core inflation, which strips out volatile factors such as energy and food, fell to 1.0% in March, from 1.2% 1.4% in February. That\u2019s the lowest measure of core inflation since July 2006, suggesting weak underlying inflation pressures. The Retail Prices Index measure of inflation rose by 0.9% year-on-year in March, down from 1.0% in February. That\u2019s weaker than expected. Britain came extremely close to negative inflation, though. The Office for National Statistics says that March\u2019s consumer prices index actually dropped by 0.01% - which it has rounded up to zero. Breaking: Britain has avoided falling into negative inflation. Consumer price inflation remained steady in March at 0.0%, meaning prices were unchanged year-on-year. So inflation remains at its weakest level since 1960 More to follow.... Just 4 minutes to go until we find whether UK inflation remained at zero in March or not.... Greece\u2019s denial that it\u2019s preparing to default next month hasn\u2019t prevented its government bonds weakening this morning. That\u2019s driving the yield, or interest rates, on its debt into even higher and more worrying levels: Weak inflation isn\u2019t just a British phenomenon. Prices across the eurozone have been falling since December, and America\u2019s CPI rate also briefly dipped below zero in January. Why? Falling oil prices and sluggish economic growth get the blame. If you look back into history, periods of falling prices were a common sight until second world war. As our economics editor Larry Elliott wrote back in 2007: In the 19th century there were as many years of falling prices as of rising prices, with the result that the cost of living was lower when the first world war broke out in 1914 than it had been when Wellington triumphed at Waterloo in 1815. But since 1945, deflation has been considered yesterday\u2019s problem - in the UK at least. Japan, Sweden and the Czech Republic have all had periods of negative inflation, but the last time the published inflation rate went negative in Britain was in 1947. For most of the time, policymakers have been terrified at the prospect of an inflationary spiral, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, when the annual increase in the cost of living rose above 20%. That followed the death of the gold standard, which gave countries the flexibility to weaken their currencies by expanding the money supply. There will be a splurge of data at 9.30am, as the Office for National Statistics releases its latest survey of UK house prices alongside the inflation data. We also get the latest Retail Price Index, another inflation measure that also includes housing costs. That\u2019s expected to have risen by 1.0% in March -- so no sign of deflation there.... We probably shouldn\u2019t get too excited about inflation turning negative this morning. A majority of City economists surveyed by Reuters reckon the Consumer Prices Index will remain unchanged in an hour\u2019s time, meaning inflation remained at 0.0% for the second month running. That would still mean the weakest inflation since 1960 (when My Old Man\u2019s A Dustman was leading the charts). Dominic Bryant, head of UK economics at BNP Paribas, reckons inflation will remain weak for some months: \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be deflation. The bigger picture is it is going to be close to zero for another two or three months. It is low inflation now \u2013 you might get a negative print, you might not, but it is not deflation.\u201d Today\u2019s inflation data will include the impact of a recent 5% price cut by British Gas. That should bring utility bills lower, after years of inflation-busting price hikes helped to drive the cost of living up. Petrol prices, though, appear to have bottomed out. Centrica, incidentally, has just announced the new boss of British Gas -- Mark Hodges, an insurance industry veteran. It\u2019s a politically charged appointment, given Labour pledge to rein in the energy sector if it wins the general election. Denial ain\u2019t just a river in Egypt, it\u2019s also the Greek government\u2019s standard response to most media reports these days. This time, Athens has rubbished a report in the Financial Times that said it was preparing to default if it can\u2019t reach agreement with creditors by the end of April. According to the FT, Greece would withhold payments due to the IMF next month. Here\u2019s a flavour: The government, which is rapidly running out of funds to pay public sector salaries and state pensions, has decided to withhold \u20ac2.5bn of payments due to the International Monetary Fund in May and June if no agreement is struck, they said. \u201cWe have come to the end of the road . . . If the Europeans won\u2019t release bailout cash, there is no alternative [to a default],\u201d one government official said. A Greek default would represent an unprecedented shock to Europe\u2019s 16-year-old monetary union only five years after Greece received the first of two EU-IMF bailouts that amounted to a combined \u20ac245bn. Such reports could potentially help Greece squeeze a deal out of its lenders. But a Greek government official insists it\u2019s not true. However, if Greece doesn\u2019t get a cash injection soon, it may not have much choice.... Today\u2019s inflation numbers will not improve the Bank of England\u2019s track record on hitting (or missing) its goals. Since the financial crisis began, the CPI index has only enjoyed a passing relationship with the BoE\u2019s 2% target, as this chart from last month shows: Press Association have published a Q&amp;A about the possibility of the UK inflation rate falling below zero today. Has this ever happened before? CPI has never turned negative since comparable records began in 1989. According to an experimental data series by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) going back to 1950 it was last negative, at minus 0.6%, in March 1960. Would it mean the pound in my pocket is worth more? Yes. CPI at minus 0.1% would mean a basket of goods worth 100 a year ago is now worth 99.90. Low inflation has been driven by falling petrol and grocery prices. Is there a downside? Sustained falling prices could mean shoppers putting off purchases and firms delaying investment, while mortgages become less affordable, especially if wages drop. But this is thought unlikely, with temporary causes such as low oil prices likely to fade. What will this mean for the General Election? Coalition politicians will hope added purchase power creates a feel-good factor as well as boosting consumer spending and lifting the economy. But the boost to growth might come too late to affect first quarter figures out a week before the poll. How will this affect interest rates? The Bank of England must try to return inflation towards its target of 2% so low CPI should mean rates at 0.5% for longer. Deeper or more prolonged negative inflation could create growing speculation of interest rates being cut even further. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is Britain experiencing its first bout of negative inflation since Harold Macmillan was running the country? We\u2019ll find out at 9.30am BST today, when the Office for National Statistics reveals the latest consumer prices index. With the UK election just 23 days away, the figures will be scrutinised by all sides for clues into the state of the economy. Some City economists predict the annual CPI turned negative in March, indicating that the cost of living actually fell (slightly) compared with a year ago. That hasn\u2019t happened in over half a century, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics which suggest CPI (had it existed) would have fallen by 0.6% in March 1960. The headline measure of inflation hit zero in February, dragged down by price-cutting between supermarkets and the slide in the oil price since last summer. Other number-crunchers, though, reckon CPI probably remained nailed at 0.0% last month. And either way, we\u2019re unlikely to see full-blown deflation in Britain (a protracted period of falling prices, where people expect inflation to keep falling). Alicia Higson, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, says: It is likely this will be a short-lived bout of deflation and the UK will returning to inflation later this year. And we shouldn\u2019t forget that inflation was significantly over the UK\u2019s 2% target between 2011 and 2014. So shoppers have earned some relief. As Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, put it: \u201cWhile food price deflation of close to 4% year on year may sound extreme, this represents something of a relief after years of rapid price increases. More specifically, over the seven years between 2007 and 2013, the average annual pace of increase in food price inflation was 5% per year. Enjoy the cheap food and fuel while it lasts!\u201d Here\u2019s our full preview: We\u2019ll bring you all the data and full reaction from 9.30am, along with other developments through the day, including Greece\u2019s bailout talks.",

Wednesday sees the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, with investors hoping an update on its quantitative easing programme will provide some support to the markets.

Highly solvent banks will be subject to deposit flight if it is the value of the currency in that country that is uncertain. <br></li> <li><strong>This is not a question of the fiscal strength of the government.</strong> The question is whether the government is willing to bear the cost of staying in the monetary union .<br></li> <li><strong>This is not a question of bank depositors being certain of a monetary union breakup</strong>. The catalyst of deposit flight is likely to be triggered by the possibility of a breakup in the monetary union.<br></li> <li><strong>Popular opinion is irrelevant </strong>(it is worth noting that a very sizeable majority of Greeks wish to remain in the Euro and this has not stopped deposits falling in that country). In dealing with one\u2019s assets the important driver of action is not what one wants to happen but what one fears might happen.<br></li> <li><strong>The example of economic pain in Greece in the wake of an exit from the Euro is irrelevant. </strong>Depositors in other countries may recognise that exit from the monetary union is economically disastrous, but if they think there is any possibility that their own economy could be forced down that route then it is logical to withdraw deposits. Indeed, economic chaos in Greece after an exit may be an incentive to accelerate deposit withdrawal elsewhere.<br></li> </ul> <p>He also provides a chart, showing that Greek bank deposits tend to fall as anxiety over the crisis rises....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99f806db645142098d61f56e150176636ef56134\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/14/1429023980653/8ec44112-46f9-4304-9223-af351c2cc3a9-460x261.png\" alt=\"Greek bank deposits\" width=\"460\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek bank deposits</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UBS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-552d25aae4b0e16b7c1cabad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-14T14:36:45.778Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini doesn\u2019t share Olivier Blanchard\u2019s optimism that a Grexit would be manageable......</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/statuses/587985371859914752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>*MOGHERINI: GREXIT `COULD BE BEGINNING OF END&#39; FOR EUROPE UNITY</p>&mdash; lemasabachthani (@lemasabachthani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemasabachthani/status/587985371859914752\">April 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-552d1a08e4b04b4dc25b77cc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-14T13:53:26.283Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">IMF: Grexit would be costly, but manageable</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Olivier Blanchard, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s chief economist, has just told reporters that the eurozone could cope if Greece quit the single currency.</strong><br></p> <p>Speaking at the press conference in Washington, Blanchard said that a Gexit would be very costly and painful, but not impossible to handle. </p> <p>There are better firewalls in place than in 2012, he pointed out, but obviously it wouldn\u2019t be smooth sailing.</p> <p><strong>It feels like a nudge to Greece to finally deliver a credible reform package by next Monday, as its increasingly impatient creditors have asked.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OpenEurope/statuses/587974835659284480\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Interesting that IMF Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard just publicly stated that a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Grexit?src=hash\">#Grexit</a> &quot;could be done&quot; &amp; handled by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eurozone?src=hash\">#Eurozone</a></p>&mdash; Open Europe (@OpenEurope) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenEurope/status/587974835659284480\">April 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-04-14T13:54:12.336Z\">at 2.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-552d1881e4b0ce66a5baf103\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-14T13:40:38.753Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If the IMF forecasts are accurate, then Britain will be the second-fastest growing advanced nation this year (having been the fastest in 2014).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RBS_Economics/statuses/587972563420209152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Latest IMF growth forecasts for the major advanced economies.

According to an experimental data series by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) going back to 1950 it was last negative, at minus 0.6%, in March 1960. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Would it mean the pound in my pocket is worth more?</strong> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes. CPI at minus 0.1% would mean a basket of goods worth 100 a year ago is now worth 99.90. Low inflation has been driven by falling petrol and grocery prices. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Is there a downside?</strong> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sustained falling prices could mean shoppers putting off purchases and firms delaying investment, while mortgages become less affordable, especially if wages drop. But this is thought unlikely, with temporary causes such as low oil prices likely to fade. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What will this mean for the General Election?</strong> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Coalition politicians will hope added purchase power creates a feel-good factor as well as boosting consumer spending and lifting the economy. But the boost to growth might come too late to affect first quarter figures out a week before the poll. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>How will this affect interest rates? </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bank of England must try to return inflation towards its target of 2% so low CPI should mean rates at 0.5% for longer.

      "bodyText": "A revival in the mining sector helped push the FTSE 100 close to its record high again but with investors still facing a number of uncertainties, it ended up falling short. On the positive side, the UK avoided falling into deflation with the latest CPI figures showing zero for the second month in a row. But with the election campaign now well underway, the impact was limited. In the US retail sales rebounded, but not by as much as analysts had expected, adding to the doubts about when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. And as usual, there was Greece to contend with, as the country struggles to agree a deal with its creditors before it runs out of cash. But with miners providing support, the UK market outpaced its European peers, with the FTSE 100 finishing 10.96 points higher at 7075.26, around 15 points shy of last Friday\u2019s peak. The commodities sector recovered from Monday\u2019s falls, lifted by hopes that Chinese GDP figures later in the week may dispel some of the concerns about the country\u2019s future growth. Anglo American added 40.8p to 1039.5, BHP Billiton was 43.5p better at 1459.5p and Rio Tinto rose 78.5p to 2892.5p. A rally in the oil price - Brent crude was around 1% higher at $58.57 a barrel by the time the London market closed - helped lift Weir, which supplies equipment to the oil industry, by 91p to \u00a318.80. Banks were helped by better than expected figures from US groups JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Barclays, which also received a positive recommendation from Credit Suisse analysts, added 2.7p to 262.15 while Lloyds Banking Group climbed 0.5p to 79.90p. But Aberdeen Asset Management fell 12.7p to 493.8p after RBC moved from sector perform to underperform and the company received an unexpected tax bill from India. Pubs group Enterprise Inns jumped 6.2p to 116.7p after a buy note from Deutsche Bank: Recent legislative changes that introduce a free-of-tie option for licensees change the commercial basis of the tenanted and leased pub market. Our analysis suggests that Enterprise should be able to offset any negative profit pressures, and that [its] evolving strategic responses will lead to eventual profit upgrades. We think that the potential changes should convert Enterprise into a more proactive, commercially minded property manager that could also encompass a partially owned REIT and a managed pub division alongside the traditional tenanted estate. We have tweaked up our price target by 5% to 215p, and remain confident that the share price should double from here. But lower down the market Gulfsands Petroleum dropped 4% to 20.5p after it removed Mahdi Sajjad from his role as chief executive and appointed Alastair Beardsall, a nominee of its top shareholder Waterford Finance, as executive chairman with immediate effect. Finally, after their recent troubles, there could be better times ahead for the UK\u2019s supermarkets, according to Shore Capital\u2019s Clive Black and Darren Shirley. They have a neutral rating on the sector, with Morrisons, down 1.2p at 199p, a buy and Tesco, 0.1p lower at 244.2p, a hold. They have sell recommendations on both Sainsbury, up 0.1p at 275p, and Ocado, off 2.4p at 364p. The Shore Capital team said: The British supermarkets fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into the wall at great speed, resulting in considerable collateral damage for shareholders. Earnings and returns collapsed, assets written down and debt mushroomed. Management and strategies have had to change. There are still challenges facing the major British supermarkets; the discounters, deflation, rebalancing to mention just three. However, we feel that heavy lifting has been undertaken and that better strategies are being applied by superior management. With favourable comparatives in tow, a rising population and economic growth could drive sustained improvement in sales densities and cash generation, progress that could have a \u2018Bookeresque\u2019 feel in time. Indeed, returns may even rise with asset values bolstered. Many institutions have been correctly underweight on the sector. We feel that a neutral position is more appropriate. Within the sector we prefer Morrison\u2019s due to its freehold and pension position plus especially favourable comparatives. We also like Dave Lewis\u2019s immediate strategy for Tesco albeit near-term benefits are priced in to us; will there yet be a rights issue? We worry about Sainsbury as it appears particularly exposed to recovering competitors and management guidance is very cautious. Finally, now profitable Ocado has still to prove its worth.",

      "bodyText": "The UK economy is a ticking time bomb set to explode after the general election, according to a leading City commentator who has warned of a fresh crisis for the pound. Albert Edwards, who heads the global strategy team at investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and is well known for downbeat views, chides the coalition for a legacy of \u201cgrotesquely wide deficits\u201d in both the public sector finances and on the UK\u2019s current account \u2013 its overall trading position with the rest of the world. In a note for the bank, Edwards wrote: As the UK general election rapidly approaches, we take a look at the UK economic situation. We say what we see, and after five years of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government, the UK economy looks like a \u2019ticking time bomb\u2019waiting to explode after the election.\u201d Edwards says his commentary is apolitical and notes he previously heaped scathing criticism on the UK economic situation under Labour in 2008. The difference with his latest critique, he says, is that this time the UK compares particularly badly with other economies. He added: \u201cAt least back then [January 2008] the UK was not alone in reaping the sour fruits of economic mismanagement \u2013 the US and the eurozone periphery were all sailing in similarly unstable, leaky boats. But now the UK economy stands alone, up to its eyeballs in macro manure. Eventually the stench will fill the nostrils of currency markets with the inevitable result \u2013 another sterling crisis.\u201d Edwards, who has previously taken aim at chancellor George Osborne\u2019s scheme to boost the housing market as one of the \u201cmost stupid economic ideas\u201d of the past 30 years, says a push to cut the deficit has failed. To the extent the UK economy has recovered, it is not because the public sector deficit cutting has worked as the government claim, but because, for the last three years, the government has quietly abandoned all pretence at fiscal cuts, kicking the can into the next parliament,\u201d he says. He is not alone in his concern over the UK\u2019s large current account deficit, which reflects the gap between money paid out by the UK and money brought in, and was the widest for more than 60 years in 2014. It emerged last week that the Bank of England is worried the gap could cause financial markets to turn against the British economy in a time of stress. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) discussed the current account deficit at its most recent meeting in March and decided to keep it under close review, the meeting minutes showed. While few financial market commentators have been as outspoken as Edwards over the coalition\u2019s record, there is widespread concern about the impact on the pound and UK shares from an uncertain election outcome. A survey of top company bosses on Tuesday showed they ranked the risk of policy change after the election and a referendum on EU membership as the biggest threats to UK business. The poll of chief financial officers (CFOs) by consultants Deloitte said rising uncertainty had cut risk appetite and prompted companies to cut spending plans. Michael Saunders, economist at Citi bank in London, predicts a protracted period of uncertainty for UK businesses. Reacting to the CFO survey, he said: Given the closeness of opinion polls, and the likelihood that all likely election outcomes will create some uncertainties \u2013 a Conservative-led government would raise risks of an EU referendum, a Labour-led government would raise risks over business costs and regulation \u2013 these policy worries are unlikely to fade quickly in our view.\u201d Analysts are warning of turbulent times on financial markets as the outcome of the 7 May vote remains almost impossible to predict. David Bloom, currency strategist at HSBC, says with polls tight traders are starting to price political risk into the pound. Investors seem to have learnt from their experience with the Scottish Referendum back in September, where political risk was largely ignored, with nothing in the price until two weeks before the vote,\u201d he says. \u201cThis time around the market has been acutely aware of political risk.\u201d Bloom notes that the best outcome for the pound from the election may be a weak coalition government. The political outcomes that worry the market the most would be outright victories. A Labour victory would bring market worries about a fiscal deficit to the fore, despite Labour\u2019s best efforts to allay such concerns. An outright Conservative victory would bring an EU \u2018in-out\u2019 referendum,\u201d he says.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global growth will step up a gear over the next two years according to the International Monetary Fund, following the collapse in oil prices and the easing of austerity programmes in developed countries. But the Washington-based organisation warned that the failure to secure a more sustainable recovery following the 2008 financial crash had left the outlook for global growth vulnerable to further economic shocks. In its six monthly world economic outlook, the IMF forecast global growth of 3.5% in 2015 \u2013 unchanged from its last update in January \u2013 and 3.8% in 2016, 0.1% stronger than it had previously expected. However, it warned that the \u201ccomplex forces\u201d that affected global activity in 2014 \u2013 including wild swings in exchange rates and collapsing commodity prices \u2013 were still shaping economic events. Longer-term issues have also depressed the \u201cproductive capacity\u201d of many countries, the IMF said, including large debt mountains and ageing populations in Europe, Japan and the US. Earlier on Tuesday, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) cut its forecasts for global trade growth this year to 3.3%, down from 4%. It said growth in 2014 fell below its forecast of 3.1%, coming out at 2.8%. \u201cWe expect trade to continue its slow recovery but with economic growth still fragile and continued geopolitical tensions, this trend could easily be undermined,\u201d said WTO director-general Roberto Azev\u00eado. The predictions come only a week after IMF boss Christine Lagarde said that the global recovery could be described as mediocre at best. She said the threat of a \u201cnew mediocrity\u201d was unlikely to go away without a concerted effort by governments to tackle longstanding issues that placed a drag on growth. The dollar has soared on world exchanges over the last year while the yen and euro have slumped. Sterling has risen against most currencies, but declined sharply this year against the dollar. In the latest report, the IMF said growth would prove to be uneven through this year and next as poorer developing nations slowed and more developed nations accelerated. It said: \u201cRelative to last year, the outlook for advanced economies is improving, while growth in emerging market and developing economies is projected to be lower, primarily reflecting weaker prospects for some large emerging market economies and oil-exporting countries.\u201d It identified several countries as a cause for concern, especially should the US increase interest rates and the dollar rise to even higher levels. In the report, it forecast that Russia will slide into a two-year period of recession following the collapse in the oil price and fluctuating markets that have sent commodity prices tumbling in recent months. Iron prices have collapsed along with the spot prices for many other metals. A drought in Brazil has seriously damaged South America\u2019s largest economy, sending it into recession this year before a mild and still-fragile recovery in 2016, the IMF said. Meanwhile, the tiger economies of south-east Asia, which have grown quickly through trade with China, are expected to suffer from the knock-on effects of slower growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Developed economies, which import oil and gas and were previously hampered by high prices, are expected to accelerate as businesses and consumers benefit from lower energy costs. The US is one of the countries likely to benefit most from low energy costs after becoming almost self-sufficient in recent years. It is expected to maintain its role as an engine of consumer demand for the rest of the world\u2019s manufactured goods. UK growth is also forecast to remain strong, but will buck the trend for developed countries to accelerate between this year and next with a fall in growth from 2.7% in 2015 to 2.3% next year. The IMF said the UK should keep interest rates until 2016, amid weak inflation. \u201cIn the UK, monetary policy should stay accommodative for now, given currently weak inflation pressures,\u201d said the IMF. Part of the problem facing Britain and other countries that failed to build enough homes was a dysfunctional housing market that failed to meet demand. The IMF said: \u201cFor Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, containing financial stability risks from housing and mortgage markets remains important.\u201d",

It said: \u201cRelative to last year, the outlook for advanced economies is improving, while growth in emerging market and developing economies is projected to be lower, primarily reflecting weaker prospects for some large emerging market economies and oil-exporting countries.\u201d  It identified several countries as a cause for concern, especially should the US increase interest rates and the dollar rise to even higher levels.  In the report, it forecast that Russia will slide into a two-year period of recession following the collapse in the oil price and fluctuating markets that have sent commodity prices tumbling in recent months. Iron prices have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/02/ron-ore-falls-below-us50\">collapsed</a> along with the spot prices for many other metals.<br>  A drought in Brazil has seriously damaged South America\u2019s largest economy, sending it into recession this year before a mild and still-fragile recovery in 2016, the IMF said. Meanwhile, the tiger economies of south-east Asia, which have grown quickly through trade with China, are expected to suffer from the knock-on effects of slower growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy. <br></p> <p>Developed economies, which import oil and gas and were previously hampered by high prices, are expected to accelerate as businesses and consumers benefit from lower energy costs.<br> <br> The US is one of the countries likely to benefit most from low energy costs after becoming almost self-sufficient in recent years. It is expected to maintain its role as an engine of consumer demand for the rest of the world\u2019s manufactured goods. UK growth is also forecast to remain strong, but will buck the trend for developed countries to accelerate between this year and next with a fall in growth from 2.7%<br> in 2015 to 2.3% next year. The IMF said the UK should keep interest rates until 2016, amid weak inflation.</p> <p>\u201cIn the UK, monetary policy should stay accommodative for now, given currently weak inflation pressures,\u201d said the IMF. <br> <br> Part of the problem facing Britain and other countries that failed to build enough homes was a dysfunctional housing market that failed to meet demand. The IMF said: \u201cFor Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, containing financial stability risks from housing and mortgage markets remains important.\u201d</p>",

      "standfirst": "<p>Thousands of fast-food workers are protesting on Wednesday in the fight for higher wages. But franchisees are dealing with their own problems</p>", 
      "body": "<p>As thousands of fast-food workers prepare to strike over wages on Wednesday, much of their ire will be directed at the franchise owners who control the vast majority of the restaurants where they work. But franchisees have their problems, too.</p> <p>A McDonald\u2019s milkshake machine costs $20,000. Its grills are $15,000. Making ends meet isn\u2019t so easy for either side, says Kathryn Slater-Carter. Until last month, Slater-Carter had been McDonald\u2019s franchisee for close to 35 years. She and her husband, Ed, got into the McDonald\u2019s business in the early 1980s in Daly City, California. Leaving behind jobs in education and banking, respectively, to join her father in the family business. Franchisees account for about 90% of McDonald\u2019s stores in America.</p> <p>\u201cInitially, we had three stores. My dad retired and sold one, so Ed and I ended up with two,\u201d she said. Then, a few years ago, McDonald\u2019s refused to renew a franchisee license for one of their stores. The store, in the local mall, brought about $2m a year, and provided jobs for about 30 people. Yet, just like that, it was shut down, Slater-Carter told the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e63924c2-0a23-40f6-815d-1b9edc2a2917\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/13/1428958930481/e0a469a9-3286-41bb-a400-fb405cdae297-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"McDonald's staff members serve hamburgers at their fast food restaurant downtown Milan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franchisees say computers are to blame for McDonald\u2019s oversight of their day to day operations. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McDonald\u2019s, which collected rent worth of about 12.75% of each month\u2019s sales, did not renew the lease with the mall. The space, which Slater-Carter and her husband had spent $500,000 renovating a few years back after asbestos removal, had to be restored to its original state, which cost them another $10,000 in contractor fees.</p> <p>Shocked by the way they were treated, they decided to sell the second location, where they employed about 55 workers and brought in about $3.6m in sales each year. The license on that store was valid until June 2016, but they weren\u2019t going to take any chances.</p> <p>\u201cMcDonald\u2019s decisions about whether to enter into new franchise agreements with existing owner/operators are determined on a case-by-case basis. We discuss those decisions with our owner/operators, but do not discuss them publicly,\u201d Lisa McComb, a spokeswoman for McDonald\u2019s told the Guardian.</p> <p>Slater-Carter has <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB610\">attempted to introduce legislation</a> that would give franchisees more rights and allow them to recoup some of their investment if a parent company such as McDonald\u2019s wrongly terminates their agreement. The legislation was vetoed by California governor Jerry Brown in September. This year, Slater-Carter is trying again:<a href=\"http://nrn.com/government/california-lawmakers-bring-back-franchise-relations-bill\"> a new version of the bill was introduced on 6 April</a>.</p> <p>As a recent franchise owner, Slater-Carter is well positioned to talk about the challenges and the costs that franchisees often face.</p> <h2>Wages: corporate v franchisee</h2> <p>\u201cMy rough calculations \u2013 we don\u2019t have precise average wage information from McDonald\u2019s \u2013 are that the impact of a $1 increase to the US average wage is approximately $50,000 to $54,000 per company-owned restaurant,\u201d John Gordon of Pacific Management Consulting Group told the Guardian.</p> <p>If franchisees were to implement similar wage hike, their cost per restaurant is likely to be higher.</p> <p>\u201cFranchisees traditionally pay a little bit less. If they were trying to make it so that they are a dollar over the minimum wage \u2013 state, local or federal \u2013 then the impact might be a little bit more,\u201d said Gordon. Average franchisee wages are not reported, so any estimates are purely a guess, he added. </p> <p>As it stands, McDonald\u2019s franchisees are dealing with additional costs: </p> <ul> <li>franchisees pay a royalty fee to McDonald\u2019s of about 5%, according to Gordon. Slater-Carter said their royalty fee was 3%;</li> <li>they also pay an roughly 5% for advertising to McDonald\u2019s;</li> <li>many of the franchisees pay rent to McDonald\u2019s. For Slater-Cater, that was about 12.5%. On average, Gordon said that number is about 15%;<br></li> <li>remodelling costs can be huge and are required by the company for renewals.</li> </ul> <p>With all these extra costs, franchisees are more likely to have a smaller profit margin than the corporate store and, thus, less funds to use for a pay hike.<br></p> <p>\u201cMcDonald\u2019s does not set wages for the independent owner/operators,\u201d McComb told the Guardian when asked if the company would offer any assistance to franchisees looking to raise wages for their employees. \u201cIndependent owner/operators make decisions that they feel are right for their employees and their businesses.\u201d</p> <p>Slater-Cater claims she has received advice on wages before. Last year <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/08/04/first-person-kathryn-slater-carter-the-franchise-owner-taking-on-mcdonalds/\">she told the Washington Post</a> that McDonald\u2019s representatives had told her to \u201cpay your employees less\u201d when she complained about low prices hurting her business.</p> <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"648c805227cd71efc5ec86f8f2291c4da69ffe7f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/13/1428933776866/77ecc184-185b-4151-971b-4d930b45407b-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"FILE - LOS ANGELES, CA - JULY 24:  The sun rises behind the golden arches of a McDonalds restaurant on July 24, 2008 on Figueroa Street in the South Los Angeles area of Los Angeles, California.

Councilwoman Jan Perry proposed the measure to try to reduce health problems associated with a diet high in fast-food, like obesity and diabetes, which plague many of the half-million people living there.

      "bodyText": "As thousands of fast-food workers prepare to strike over wages on Wednesday, much of their ire will be directed at the franchise owners who control the vast majority of the restaurants where they work. But franchisees have their problems, too. A McDonald\u2019s milkshake machine costs $20,000. Its grills are $15,000. Making ends meet isn\u2019t so easy for either side, says Kathryn Slater-Carter. Until last month, Slater-Carter had been McDonald\u2019s franchisee for close to 35 years. She and her husband, Ed, got into the McDonald\u2019s business in the early 1980s in Daly City, California. Leaving behind jobs in education and banking, respectively, to join her father in the family business. Franchisees account for about 90% of McDonald\u2019s stores in America. \u201cInitially, we had three stores. My dad retired and sold one, so Ed and I ended up with two,\u201d she said. Then, a few years ago, McDonald\u2019s refused to renew a franchisee license for one of their stores. The store, in the local mall, brought about $2m a year, and provided jobs for about 30 people. Yet, just like that, it was shut down, Slater-Carter told the Guardian. McDonald\u2019s, which collected rent worth of about 12.75% of each month\u2019s sales, did not renew the lease with the mall. The space, which Slater-Carter and her husband had spent $500,000 renovating a few years back after asbestos removal, had to be restored to its original state, which cost them another $10,000 in contractor fees. Shocked by the way they were treated, they decided to sell the second location, where they employed about 55 workers and brought in about $3.6m in sales each year. The license on that store was valid until June 2016, but they weren\u2019t going to take any chances. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s decisions about whether to enter into new franchise agreements with existing owner/operators are determined on a case-by-case basis. We discuss those decisions with our owner/operators, but do not discuss them publicly,\u201d Lisa McComb, a spokeswoman for McDonald\u2019s told the Guardian. Slater-Carter has attempted to introduce legislation that would give franchisees more rights and allow them to recoup some of their investment if a parent company such as McDonald\u2019s wrongly terminates their agreement. The legislation was vetoed by California governor Jerry Brown in September. This year, Slater-Carter is trying again: a new version of the bill was introduced on 6 April. As a recent franchise owner, Slater-Carter is well positioned to talk about the challenges and the costs that franchisees often face. Wages: corporate v franchisee \u201cMy rough calculations \u2013 we don\u2019t have precise average wage information from McDonald\u2019s \u2013 are that the impact of a $1 increase to the US average wage is approximately $50,000 to $54,000 per company-owned restaurant,\u201d John Gordon of Pacific Management Consulting Group told the Guardian. If franchisees were to implement similar wage hike, their cost per restaurant is likely to be higher. \u201cFranchisees traditionally pay a little bit less. If they were trying to make it so that they are a dollar over the minimum wage \u2013 state, local or federal \u2013 then the impact might be a little bit more,\u201d said Gordon. Average franchisee wages are not reported, so any estimates are purely a guess, he added. As it stands, McDonald\u2019s franchisees are dealing with additional costs: franchisees pay a royalty fee to McDonald\u2019s of about 5%, according to Gordon. Slater-Carter said their royalty fee was 3%; they also pay an roughly 5% for advertising to McDonald\u2019s; many of the franchisees pay rent to McDonald\u2019s. For Slater-Cater, that was about 12.5%. On average, Gordon said that number is about 15%; remodelling costs can be huge and are required by the company for renewals. With all these extra costs, franchisees are more likely to have a smaller profit margin than the corporate store and, thus, less funds to use for a pay hike. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s does not set wages for the independent owner/operators,\u201d McComb told the Guardian when asked if the company would offer any assistance to franchisees looking to raise wages for their employees. \u201cIndependent owner/operators make decisions that they feel are right for their employees and their businesses.\u201d Slater-Cater claims she has received advice on wages before. Last year she told the Washington Post that McDonald\u2019s representatives had told her to \u201cpay your employees less\u201d when she complained about low prices hurting her business. Blame the technology Life has got harder for franchisees in recent years, said Slater-Carter. Running a McDonald\u2019s store back in the 1970s or 1980s allowed for a much greater level of independence, she said, recalling the years when her dad first opened his. \u201cOne of the bad things that has happened from computers is that that [independence] is no longer there,\u201d she said.

      "bodyText": "Put the \u201cBritain slides into deflation\u201d headlines on hold for another month. Higher petrol prices meant that the annual inflation rate in the UK in March was zero, the same as it was in February. Technically speaking, even had the Office for National Statistics announced that last month\u2019s inflation rate had been negative, it would not have qualified as deflation. Deflation is a generalised and persistent fall in prices. One month of negative inflation caused for the most part by a halving of the cost of oil is neither generalised nor persistent. Even so, the ONS data provides plenty of evidence that upward pressure on inflation in Britain is non-existent. The trend in inflation is unambiguously downwards. That\u2019s apparent from the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living, the consumer prices index, where the annual inflation rate has fallen from 1.6% to zero since last July. More significantly, so-called core inflation has followed a similar trajectory. Core inflation excludes items such as energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, whose prices can shoot up and down as a result of global factors or changes in excise duties. As such, economists consider it to be a good guide to the underlying direction. Core inflation was 1.9% in August last year, but has fallen steadily ever since to stand currently at 1%. This might not classify as deflation, but there is certainly plenty of deinflationary pressure in the UK. What does this mean? It means that the Bank of England is under absolutely no pressure to tighten policy. Indeed, the trend in core inflation suggests that the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is right to suggest that Threadneedle Street should keep the option of providing more stimulus open. It means that living standards are rising, because earnings are growing by 2% while prices are not rising at all. Things could now go in one of two ways. A longer period of low interest rates and rising real incomes could ldrive faster growth, leading to employers offering higher wages to attract and retain staff. Alternatively, low inflation could make employers even meaner with the pay deals they offer their workers. If annual average earnings start to fall rather than rise, deflation would become a reality.",

      "body": "<p>Put the \u201cBritain slides into deflation\u201d headlines on hold for another month. Higher petrol prices meant that the annual inflation rate in the UK in March was zero, the same as it was in February.</p> <p>Technically speaking, even had the Office for National Statistics announced that last month\u2019s inflation rate had been negative, it would not have qualified as deflation. </p> <p>Deflation is a generalised and persistent fall in prices. One month of negative inflation caused for the most part by a halving of the cost of oil is neither generalised nor persistent.</p> <p>Even so, the ONS data provides plenty of evidence that upward pressure on inflation in Britain is non-existent. The trend in inflation is unambiguously downwards.</p> <p>That\u2019s apparent from the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living, the consumer prices index, where the annual inflation rate has fallen from 1.6% to zero since last July.</p> <p>More significantly, so-called core inflation has followed a similar trajectory. Core inflation excludes items such as energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, whose prices can shoot up and down as a result of global factors or changes in excise duties. As such, economists consider it to be a good guide to the underlying direction.</p> <p>Core inflation was 1.9% in August last year, but has fallen steadily ever since to stand currently at 1%. This might not classify as deflation, but there is certainly plenty of deinflationary pressure in the UK.</p> <p>What does this mean? It means that the Bank of England is under absolutely no pressure to tighten policy. Indeed, the trend in core inflation suggests that the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is right to suggest that Threadneedle Street should keep the option of providing more stimulus open.</p> <p>It means that living standards are rising, because earnings are growing by 2% while prices are not rising at all.<br></p> <p>Things could now go in one of two ways. A longer period of low interest rates and rising real incomes could ldrive faster growth, leading to employers offering higher wages to attract and retain staff.</p> <p>Alternatively, low inflation could make employers even meaner with the pay deals they offer their workers. If annual average earnings start to fall rather than rise, deflation would become a reality.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s inflation rate has held at its record low of zero, giving disposable incomes a boost and leaving the country on the brink of a period of falling prices. The Office for National Statistics said inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, held at zero in March, unchanged from February, which was the lowest since comparable records began in 1989. Estimates from the ONS suggest it was the lowest reading since 1960. Statisticians said that if the change in March was calculated to two decimal places, then prices were 0.01% lower than a year before. This would be the first fall on record in consumer price inflation. The news was welcomed by the chancellor, George Osborne, as the Conservatives seek to flag up their economic record and play down Labour talk of a \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d. But critics of the coalition\u2019s economic policy were quick to argue low inflation was a sign of weakness. Inflation holds at record low Economists had forecast that the offsetting effects of rebounding petrol prices and a price cut by British Gas would keep inflation at zero in March. But predictions in the poll by Reuters ranged from negative inflation of 0.2% to inflation of 0.1%. The ONS said the biggest downward effect on the cost of living in March came from falls in clothing and gas prices. These were offset by a rise in fuel prices, as average petrol prices rose by 3.8p in March and diesel by a similar amount against the backdrop of rebounding crude oil prices. Clothing and gas bill cuts keep inflation low The official figures showed core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as food and fuels, was the lowest since July 2006, falling to 1% in March from 1.2% in February. That came on the back of rare March discounting in the clothing sector. The ONS said it was the first time that clothing and footwear prices had fallen between February and March since the consumer price index was introduced. Economists say the UK is still likely to enter a period of falling prices soon \u2013 following in the footsteps of other countries. Eurozone inflation has been negative since December, and the US rate turned negative in January before recovering to zero in February. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, commented: The UK just avoided deflation in March, but inflation could yet dip into negative territory at some point in the coming months ... The indirect impact of lower energy prices will take a while to come through and so the core rate could drop further in the coming months, tipping the headline rate below zero. Even if the UK does narrowly avoid deflation, inflation is still likely to hover close to zero for most of 2015.\u201d Bank of England policymakers and City analysts say a bout of negative inflation should not be cause for alarm. They predict it will prove temporary, unlike the deflationary spiral in Japan, where people have lived with falling prices for two decades. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has sought to allay fears that Britain faces a 1930s-style deflationary spiral, describing the falling oil price as \u201cunambiguously good\u201d for the economy. Low, or non-existent, inflation means there is no need to raise interest rates any time soon. The City expects the first rate rise, from the current record low of 0.5%, to come late next year. The British Chambers of Commerce said low inflation would support the recovery but to sustain business confidence the Bank of England should commit to keeping interest rates on hold until at least early 2016. David Kern, chief economist at the business lobby group, commented: Continued low inflation is good news for the economy, particularly at a time when wage increases are modest and businesses are facing challenges ... If deflation is to emerge it should be short-term because of the strength of the UK\u2019s largest sector, the service sector, where inflation remains above 2%.\u201d But the trade unions group TUC viewed the latest figures as evidence of a shaky economic recovery. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: Zero inflation is a mark of the weak condition the economy has been left in by a failed economic plan. Stagnating prices are not a sound foundation for the strong and sustained pay rises that workers have been waiting years for.\u201d There was little evidence of any inflationary pressure in the pipeline in separate ONS figures on prices paid and charged by manufacturers. Factory gate inflation was negative, with prices charged for goods down 1.7% on a year ago, unchanged from the pace of deflation seen in February. Input prices were down sharply on a year ago, falling 13%, a slightly softer pace of deflation than the 13.5% drop in February. Factory gate prices fall again",

      "bodyText": "Ahead of UK inflation figures, which could fall into negative territory, leading shares are edging higher. Banks and mining shares are leading the way, the latter recovering from Monday\u2019s China-induced falls. Rio Tinto has risen 46.5p to 2860.5p while BHP Billiton is 21p better at \u00a314.37. Among the financials, Barclays is up 4.45p at 263.90 and Royal Bank of Scotland has climbed 5p to 358.2p. Barclays benefited from analysts at Credit Suisse putting it as its second favourite European investment bank behind UBS, although they warned further restructuring and litigation issues were possible. Overall there is still caution around, with continuing worries about Greece running out of cash before it can reach a deal with its eurozone creditors, the uncertainty over the UK election, as well as concerns about when the US will raise interest rates. The US reporting season will also be in focus. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe at Interactive Investor said: US earnings look set to drive markets over the next week, as investors hope that company results don\u2019t disappoint. Dollar strength and the oil price slump have subdued expectations. Companies with overseas earnings will earn less in dollar terms. Companies competing in international markets (either at home or abroad) are likely to have struggled with lower prices or reduced sales volumes. To make matters worse, low oil prices will have affected energy companies significantly, while the unexpected cold snap in March will have hampered sales more generally. But for the moment the FTSE 100 is up 13.03 points at 7077.33. Missing out is Aberdeen Asset Management, down 10.4p at 496.1p after RBC moved from sector perform to underperform and cut its target price from 475p to 455p. It said: We reduce our earnings per share forecasts by 8% in 2015, 4% in 2016 and 5% in 2017.
