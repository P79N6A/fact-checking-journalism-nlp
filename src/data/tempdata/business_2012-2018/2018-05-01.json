      "bodyText": "A group of Nisa shopkeepers are making a last-ditch attempt to stop the Co-op\u2019s \u00a3143m takeover of the convenience chain. The deal is due to clear its final hurdle on Friday with a court hearing in London to approve a fast-track takeover process known as a scheme of arrangement. But a group of Nisa shopkeepers calling themselves \u201cJustice for Nisa\u201d has hired a lawyer to represent them at the hearing, after raising a fighting fund from other disgruntled shareholders. Last year the Nisa board recommended that the 1,190 shopkeepers who own the business accept the Co-op\u2019s offer, which includes \u00a320,000 up front as well as deferred payments worth more than \u00a3410,000 for those who own 250 shares in Nisa, the maximum allowed. When it was voted on in November, the deal won support from 75.8% of Nisa\u2019s members, just over the 75% required to succeed. The group, which is thought to represent 20 to 30 shopkeepers, has written to other shareholders advising them of their plan. \u201cSince the vote was forced over the line by a minute majority, a group of members have been working hard to create a valid and worthwhile representation to the court hearing, objecting to the takeover on a number of grounds,\u201d they wrote in an email. \u201cThere appears to be an ever increasing number of shareholders who regret the decision to sell and a swell of support to challenge the completion.\u201d The Northern Independent Supermarket Association was launched in the late 1970s, aiming to \u201cprotect the interests of independents against the insurgence of the national supermarket chains\u201d. Nisa\u2019s members include entrepreneurs running small chains, giving the business a network of 2,400 stores. The Co-op offer, which valued Nisa at about 20 times its current share price, was given the green light by the Competition and Markets Authority last month. Against a backdrop of Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn acquisition of the wholesaler Booker, Nisa chairman Peter Hartley said it was a good deal as the convenience store environment was \u201cchanging rapidly\u201d. \u201cCo-op will add buying power and product range to our offering, while respecting our culture of independence,\u201d he said. A Nisa spokesman said: \u201cNisa remains confident that all appropriate legal process has been observed throughout the scheme of arrangement and vote \u2013 which resulted in overwhelming member support for the Co-op\u2019s acquisition.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "How are the share prices of Tesco and little ol\u2019 Morrisons doing as a bigger and fiercer supermarket creation \u2013 the two-headed Sainsbury\u2019s/Asda beast \u2013 comes into view? Are they collapsing as investors prepare for keener price competition? Are executives also trembling in fear of their bonuses as Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe vows to unleash 10% price cuts? Hardly. While Sainsbury\u2019s market value has improved by 16% since Monday morning, investors in Tesco and Morrisons have not recoiled in horror. Share prices in both firms have barely budged. Let\u2019s hope the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is watching. Its job is to protect the interest of consumers and, to judge by the stock market\u2019s reaction, it\u2019s hard to spot any clear gain for shoppers via this proposed \u00a315bn mega-merger. Almost nobody in the City is talking about supermarkets having to compete harder for custom, thereby putting their profit margins under renewed pressure. In Coupe\u2019s view, the reward for consumers will be 10% lower prices of \u201cmany of the products customers buy most regularly\u201d, but since he hasn\u2019t bothered to state what these products are, or even be precise about how many are on the list, his promise is too vague to be trusted. He has confidently predicted the annual boost to profits for shareholders will be \u00a3500m but has offered no equivalent round-number saving for shoppers. Bruno Monteyne from Bernstein, viewing affairs through the lens of a stock analyst, calls it \u201ca great deal, at a great time, at a great price\u201d. It probably is \u2013 for Sainsbury\u2019s. But shoppers and the CMA should note two of his observations. First, Asda-owner Walmart, which will end up with a 42% stake in Sainsbury\u2019s, is \u201cnot in the UK to invest material amounts of capital\u201d and is instead in the game of \u201charvesting cash\u201d. Second, the merger partners have signalled they want to be \u201crational\u201d, which means the deal \u201cis not a new phase in a price war cycle\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s has been convinced by its lawyers that the CMA will approve the deal with few restrictions because the boffins, on the evidence of recent Tesco/Booker and Ladbrokes/Coral rulings, take a broader view of what counts as a competitor these days and will be impressed that Aldi and Lidl exist. That analysis may prove correct, but the CMA, if it\u2019s doing its job properly, should look beyond standard spreadsheets detailing local catchment areas. This merger would radically alter the structure of a supermarket industry where competition is demonstrably working well. Two companies would have a combined share of about 60%, a concentration that is surely only tolerable if there are easy-to-identify and permanent benefits for the customers. On evidence seen so far, shareholders have reasons to cheer but shoppers don\u2019t. Barclays stuck in the tunnel Edward Bramson, the activist investor on Barclays\u2019 tail, didn\u2019t copy the climate change protesters by storming the stage at Barclays\u2019 annual meeting. As far as we know, he didn\u2019t even attend. Had he done so, he could have made a reasonable request to John McFarlane: please find a new cliche. At his first annual meeting as chair, in April 2016, McFarlane declared there was \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d. In May last year, there was an upgrade: \u201cDespite a few remaining dark patches, the light at the end of the tunnel gets brighter with each step\u201d. On Wednesday, McFarlane removed the reference to dark spots and said the light is still improving. Up to a point, this talk of Barclays moving into a \u201cnew phase\u201d is legitimate. Chief executive Jes Staley \u2013 when he isn\u2019t being criticised by the Financial Conduct Authority for failing to exercise due skill, care and diligence in the whistleblower episode \u2013 has stuck to the intended script. Barclays Africa was sold, a reasonable deal was done with the US Department of Justice on mortgage-backed securities and it is more possible to believe (but by no means guaranteed) that the investment bank isn\u2019t a money-pit. Yet the self-congratuatory tone from the boardroom jars. Shouldn\u2019t Barclays have exited the tunnel by now? Remember McFarlane\u2019s earlier ambition in July 2015, as told to top managers: the aim was to double the bank\u2019s share price in three years. With two months left on the clock, it\u2019s not happening. The shares were 260p at the time; now they\u2019re 206p. Bramson\u2019s improvement plan for Barclays, whatever it is, may be wrong-headed and risk a return to a murkier part of the tunnel. But, if one complaint is that McFarlane promised faster returns for shareholders than Barclays has delivered, his point would be fair. One assumes the chair knows as much, which would explain why he plans to stay for another year.",

      "bodyText": "And finally.... RBS\u2019s decision to shut 162 branches across the country has caused a stir in Westminster Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow City Minister, is concerned that customer will be left without a local branch - an issue brought into the spotlight by TSB\u2019s tech breakdown. Reynolds says: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely disappointing to see RBS closing yet more branches and putting more jobs at risk. \u201cThese closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. \u201cUnder a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.\u201d Conservative MP Nicky Morgan is also concerned that some customers will lose access to banking services. Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee (which will grill TSB tomorrow), says: \u201cIn recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. \u201cAs a result of RBS\u2019 decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It\u2019s important for the Government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the Government may be required to intervene.\u201d Time for a recap: The pound has fallen sharply to its lowest level since mid-January, as fresh signs of economic weakness undermine the case for raising UK interest rates. Sterling has shed almost one and a half cents to $1.3633, a fall of 1%. The selloff came after output in Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector slumped to a 17-month low in April. A new survey of business chiefs found that production, new business and employment growth across the industry slowed. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) fell to 53.9, from 54.9, and closer to the 50-point mar recorded in March. Economists were expecting a figure of 54.8. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said the UK manufacturing sector lost further steam last month. \u201cWhile adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April\u2019s disappointing performance.\u201d Duncan Johnston, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, says: \u201cUK Manufacturing PMI fell further than expected in April 2018. Having been resilient in the first quarter of 2018 this turning point shows a marked decline in manufacturing confidence. Output increased more slowly and new orders arrived at a slower rate than in Q1. \u201cFalling order backlogs mean that optimism is likely to remain lower for some months. However, on the positive side growth remained above the long-term average of 51.7 and represents almost two years of continuous growth in manufacturing output. Production rose due to strong customer confidence, new products and increased capacity. \u201cIn the coming months, manufacturers need to measure their decisions on increased investment and hiring of staff against these signs of a slowing in output growth.\u201d In another sign of weakness, consumer credit slowed sharply in March, adding to speculation that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold this month. Influencial investor Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said weak data is dragging the pound down. The threat of a trade war was also blamed for hurting business confidence. On that front.... European politicians are unhappy that they\u2019ve only been given a one-month extension to avoid new US tariffs on steel and aluminium. France, Germany, the UK and the European Commission are both pushing for a permanent extension, after president Trump decided to delay tariffs until June - while negotiations continue. In other news: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced the closure of 162 stores, with the loss of nearly 800 jobs. McDonald\u2019s staff have held a walkout to demand better pay and labour rights, with the backing of shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Environmental campaigners have challenged Barclays to clean up its act, at its AGM in London. The slump in the pound has only given the London stock market a small lift. The FTSE 100 had gained 0.2%, while other European markets are closed for May Day. Wall Street has fallen in early trading, as investors brace for Apple\u2019s earnings after the closing bell Just in: Growth in America\u2019s manufacturing sector slowed a little last month, but remained robust, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management. A rival survey from Markit is equally upbeat: Workers at fast food chain McDonalds have received the backing of Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor as they protest against working conditions. McDonald\u2019s staff at five restaurants walked out today, as part of their ongoing campain for union recognition and a minimum wage of \u00a310 per hour. The workers, as Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford in south-east London, and two branches in Watford, formed picket lines outside branches. They chose May Day - or International Workers\u2019 Day - as an ideal time to fight their \u201cexploitative\u201d contracts. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, says he backs the protests. He has written to McDonald\u2019s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, to say that the striking workers are behaving in a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d way. McDonnell says: I believe that every worker deserves what these workers are calling for: 1. A real living wage of at least \u00a310 an hour, 2. Security in work and a choice of fixed hours, 3. The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of Age, 4. And the right to form a trade union and for that union to be recognised by your company. The BFAWU, which supports workers organizing in McDonalds, have informed me that there are allegations that McDonalds is pursuing what could be described as union busting policies and possibly acting illegally in its treatment of workers joining its union. I am writing to request that you investigate these claims seriously in order to ensure any anti union practices are not being undertaken. Labour MP Chris Ruane is alarmed that Royal Bank of Scotland are planning to close 162 branches: Banking expert Ian Fraser isn\u2019t convinced by RBS\u2019s claim that its branches overlap too much: Sky News\u2019s Adam Parsons has a good theory about what\u2019s going on: Newsflash: Royal Bank of Scotland has announced it is shutting 162 branches, with the loss of almost 800 jobs. It\u2019s all because RBS is no longer spinning off its Williams &amp; Glyn business as a separate entity with 300 branches. An RBS spokesperson said: \u201cWe are no longer launching Williams &amp; Glyn as a challenger bank, and we now have two branch networks operating in close proximity to each other; NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, in England &amp; Wales. As a result we have had to review our overall branch footprint in England and Wales and we\u2019ve made the difficult decision to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Customers of Royal Bank of Scotland in England &amp; Wales will be able to use NatWest branches instead for their everyday banking needs. RBS is also hoping that customers will move towards using online and mobile banking, although the ongoing crisis at TSB may have deterred some late adopters from making the switch. Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the slowdown in factory growth...and what it means for UK interest rates. A group of environmental activists have just disrupted Barclay\u2019s annual general meeting in London. A group of climate change protesters stormed the meeting, and were forcibly removed after urging Barclays to stop financing environmentally damaging fossil fuel projects. They chanted: \u201ckeep it in the ground\u201d and \u201cno more fossil fuel finance\u201d , and then: \u201cBarclays bank, we said no! Fossil fuels have got to go! A student network called People &amp; Planet have said they were behind the protest. Separately, a 22-year old activist called Ocean Hyland spoke at the AGM - and asked Barclays to reconsider financing a pipeline carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. Hyland\u2019s nation, Tsleil Waututh, believe the Kinder Morgan pipeline will cause environmental damage. She explained: \u201cIf built, Kinder Morgan\u2019s project will increase tanker traffic in the inlet 7 fold, bringing with it increased risks of oil spills and pollution. It will also enable the expansion of the Alberta Oil Sands which, in turn will accelerate climate change. And that is why The Tsleil Waututh Nation will do whatever it takes to stop the Kinder Morgan project. It\u2019s been a bruising AGM for Barclays, with shareholders accusing CEO Jes Staley of being \u201cirrevocably tarnished\u201d and ask why he hasn\u2019t resigned over the whistleblowing scandal for which he was fined last year. A final decision on whether to allow Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21 Century Fox to buy Sky is close..... In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth slowed sharply in March. Phillip Inman, economics writer, explains that it could show that people are less confident about economic prospects: \u201cConsumers cut back sharply on their unsecured borrowing in March. The total borrowed on credit cards dropped from \u00a3700m in February to \u00a3100m in March, while the total borrowed for other forms of unsecured debt, primarily car loans and overdrafts, fell from \u00a31bn to \u00a3100m The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. But uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks is also understood to have played a large role in consumer\u2019s turning away from extra borrowing to fund big ticket purchases like cars and furniture. The average growth rate in total unsecured lending fell to 0.1% month on month in March, which dragged down the year on year figure to 8.6% from 9.4% in February. Peter Tutton, head of policy at the debt charity StepChange, fears the accumulation of debt in recent years, especially by poorer households, remained a problem despite the recent slowdown. He said: \u201cA decade on from the financial crisis, we must not lose sight of the impact of sustained pressure on already stretched household budgets in coping with the rising daily cost of living. We estimate that severe problem debt currently affects some 3.4 million people in the UK, so tackling and preventing vulnerable households from falling into problem debt should be high on the policymakers\u2019 agenda. \u201cWhile the financial system may not be at risk of history repeating itself in terms of systemic failure, at household finances level the risks are all too real. He said regulators and lenders needed to reduce the number of people inadvertently \u201ctrapped in a vicious cycle persistent problem debt\u201d by reviewing who is offered a loan, while the government must support affordable alternatives to affordable credit. The CBI, which represents British business leaders, says Donald Trump has kicked the (steel) can down the road. Ben Digby, international director at the CBI, says there is some relief that Europe was given a one-month exemption on steel tariffs - but a permanent deal is still needed. \u201cBusinesses urgently need to know what would have to happen for the exemption to become permanent, to properly reflect the close trading relationship between the USA and the UK - the UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over 1 million jobs in the USA, from Alaska to New York. \u201cProlonging the uncertainty around these tariffs is a lose-lose for all concerned \u2013 it damages prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Firms cannot continue making investment decisions based on short-term uncertain deadlines, and we will continue to work closely with the U.S. Administration to protect British trade, jobs and growth.\u201d Getting back to the US tariffs.... and the French government have issued a statement reiterating the EU\u2019s displeasure at Trump\u2019s decision. Paris warns that they will not open talks over wider trade terms unless he gives the bloc a permanent dispensation from tariffs on steel and aluminium. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, and Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister said in a joint statement: \u201cThe French Government takes note of the decision announced by the US authorities regarding the new temporary exemption of one month given to the EU on prices of aluminium and steel. We support the positions expressed by the European Commission. \u201cFrance will continue to advocate that the EU has a full exemption permanent and unconditioned. There is no reason that the EU is subject to unilateral increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum. France and the European Union are US allies. They are not the cause of global overcapacity in aluminum and steel and fully respect all the rules of the WTO. \u201cThe EU must remain united and solid as it has done in recent weeks. \u201cWe agree that there is an overcapacity problem in the steel industry and aluminum. We are ready to work with the United States and our other partners to make quick and appropriate solutions. But we can do it calmly until we are certain to be exempted permanently from the threat of unilateral tariff increases.\u201d Britain\u2019s factories has suffered from the threat of a global trade war, says Stephen Cooper, head of industrial manufacturing at KPMG. Here\u2019s his take on this morning\u2019s manufacturing PMI: \u201cThe implications of the postponed US steel tariffs will also be in the back of manufacturers\u2019 minds. Trade wars are never welcome and whilst it\u2019s helpful that the decision has been delayed, this is another example of uncertainty, with other geopolitical risks such as Brexit, which is not good for business confidence. Sterling has slumped to a three-month low against the US dollar following April\u2019s disappointing manufacturing data. The pound has shed a whole cent, and is languishing around $1.367, its weakest level since mid-January. City investors are concluding that the Bank of England is rather unlikely to raise interest rates this month, with so many signs that growth is slowing. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, is also concerned by the slowdown at UK factories. \u201cThe further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn\u2019t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in Sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets. Some snap reaction to the slowdown at Britain\u2019s factories last month: Business optimism among UK factory bosses has dipped to a five-month low, according to Markit\u2019s survey. It blames \u201cconcerns about Brexit, trade barriers and the overall economic climate\u201d. Britain\u2019s consumer goods industry had a particularly unimpressive April, says Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: \u201cAny hopes for an improvement to last month\u2019s steady if unremarkable pace were dashed in April as new order growth was the slowest for ten months and the consumer goods sector was particularly hit reporting the first job losses since February 2017 and the fastest drop in hiring for six and a half years. \u201cIt was left to stronger levels of export orders from Europe and the US to provide some succour to manufacturers as concerns over potential rate rises resulted in less client spending overall. This meant manufacturers were adrift with the highest growth of stock levels for ten months on the one hand but struggling to get key raw materials on the other. Higher demand and competition from other firms meant shortages returned to beset companies trying to cope with challenging delivery times as suppliers failed to complete. The slowdown in Britain\u2019s economy has gathered pace, with growth in the manufacturing sector hitting its lowest rate since autumn 2016. Data firm Markit reports that factory output, new orders and job creation all rose at a slower pace in April - partly due to an easing in demand from overseas. This pulled Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI down to 53.9, from 54.9 in March (any reading over 50 shows growth). It\u2019s a blow, especially after overall economic growth slowed to near stagnation in January-March this year. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says it\u2019s a disappointing result which can\u2019t be blamed on bad weather. \u201cWhile adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April\u2019s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote. \u201cOn this footing, the sector is unlikely to see any improvement on the near-stagnant performance signalled by the opening quarter\u2019s GDP numbers. I\u2019ll pull together more reaction now. Newsflash: UK factory growth has hit a 17-month low. More to follow..... Back in the UK, Sainsbury\u2019s chastened CEO won\u2019t be breaking into song when he sees the latest supermarket sales figures. Data firm Kantar reports that Sainsbury\u2019s only grew its sales by 0.2% in the last 12 weeks. Tesco managed 2.1% growth, Morrisons achieved 2.2%, while Asda\u2019s sales were up by 1.4%. Such a weak performance by Sainsbury highlights why Coupe has decided to merge with Asda, in the hope of cutting costs and boosting profits. Media news: Germany\u2019s government has called for European countries should receive a permanent exemption from America\u2019s tariffs on aluminium and steel. Echoing the comments from the EU, Berlin argues a deal needs to be reached when Europe\u2019s new extension expires in a month\u2019s time. Deputy government spokeswoman Martina Fietz says. Neither the European Union nor the United States can have an interest in an escalation (in tensions) in trade relation. Rather, both the U.S. and the EU would benefit from further deepening trade relations.\u201d Australia\u2019s stock market has hit a two-month high, driven by relief that Canberra has reached an \u201cagreement-in-principle\u201d with Washington to avoid steel and aluminium tariffs. The ASX 200 rose 0.5% to its highest level since the end of February, as Australia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hailed the \u201cunbreakable friendship\u201d with America. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says last night\u2019s announcement has reassured investors. Trump deciding to extend the deadline for his steel and aluminium tariffs helped lift Australian shares to a 7-week high overnight. This is encouraging news and supports the notion that the tariffs are just a negotiating stance by Trump, who in fact has no intention of implementing them. That said, there is still plenty of uncertainty over the US \u2013 China trading relations and the US - Iran nuclear deal to keep investors on edge. Labour MP Bill Esterson is also unimpressed: Over in Brussels, there\u2019s real disappointment that Europe hasn\u2019t been given a full exemption from Trump\u2019s steel and aluminium tariffs. The European Commission feels that the EU should have been given the same treatment as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. Instead, this new 30-day extension just creates more uncertainty, it feels An EU spokesperson says: \u201cThe US decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions. The EU should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security. \u201cOvercapacity in the steel and aluminium sectors does not originate in the EU. On the contrary, the EU has over the past months engaged at all possible levels with the US and other partners to find a solution to this issue. \u201cThe EU has also consistently indicated its willingness to discuss current market access issues of interest to both sides, but has also made clear that, as a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat. Any future transatlantic work programme has to be balanced and mutually beneficial. The UK Government has welcomed the news that Europe has been given an extra month\u2019s exemption on steel tariffs -- and said it hopes to make the relief permanent. A Department for International Trade spokesman warned that the tariffs could hurt global growth, saying: \u201cWe remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In a dramatic twist, Donald Trump has stepped back from launching a trade war that could have destabilised the global economy and hurt growth. Overnight, the US president reached \u201cagreements in principle\u2019 with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil to exempt them from the steel and aluminium tariffs announced earlier this year. And it what could be a narrow escape for Britain\u2019s steel industry, the US administration has postponed the decision on whether to slap tariffs on EU imports for another month. In a last-minute twist worthy of Trump\u2019s time on The Apprentice, the White House announced it had: ....reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminium, the details of which will be finalized shortly. The Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.\u201d The decision came just hours before 25% penalty on steel imports into America, and 15% on aluminium, would have come into force. Our Washington correspondent David Smith explains that Trump\u2019s decision delays a trade war with Europe -- at least for another few weeks. Trump, who ran on a nationalist \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: \u201cWe need a reciprocal relationship, which we don\u2019t have ... We\u2019re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.\u201d But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU \u2013 which is the biggest US trading partner \u2013 has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the 6.4bn euros\u2019 ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on 2.8bn euros\u2019 ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi\u2019s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. We\u2019ll be tracking reaction to the move today. Also coming up... Data firm Markit is releasing its healthcheck on Britain\u2019s factory sector. April\u2019s manufacturing PMI may show that growth weakened last month. In the City, oil giant BP has just posted a 71% jump in profits, thanks to rising crude prices. Takeaway ordering chain Just Eat is also reporting results - with revenues up 49% in the first three months of 2018. There could be drama at Barclays annual general meeting; corporate raider Ed Bramson may show up and call for the bank to be shaken up. We\u2019ll also be tracking any developments the Sainsbury-Asda merger, which took an unusual twist last night when Sainsbury CEO Mike Coupe was caught singing on camera. It\u2019s a remarkable gaffe, especially given concerns that the deal will hurt suppliers and cost jobs. Here\u2019s the agenda 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for April 10am BST: Treasury committee holds hearing on digital currencies",

    "webTitle": "RBS to close 162 branches with loss of 800 jobs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch. RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale \u2013 which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer. The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant. The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have prompted political outcries and warnings about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs. After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers. She said: \u201cIn recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas. \u201cAs a result of RBS\u2019s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It\u2019s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.\u201d Jonathan Reynolds, Labour\u2019s shadow City minister, said: \u201cThese closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result. \u201cUnder a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.\u201d The Unite union called on RBS to halt its \u201cdisastrous plans\u201d. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles. Unite\u2019s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: \u201cThe TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.\u201d RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch. The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%. Last week, RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to \u00a3792m. The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology. The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets. The FSB\u2019s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: \u201cIt\u2019s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK\u2019s bank branch network. \u201cThis fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result. He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. \u201cMany small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years \u2013 that\u2019s not something that can be replaced by an app.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland is to close 162 branches in England and Wales this summer with the loss of nearly 800 jobs, raising fresh concerns that many rural communities will soon be left without access to a bank branch.</p> <p>RBS said the job losses were the result of a deal made with the European Union last year that meant the Edinburgh-based bank would no longer be forced to sell 300 branches. Instead 60% of them will be shut down. </p> <p>The EU had demanded the sale, to increase competition, as a condition of the RBS taxpayer bailout in 2009. RBS resurrected the Williams &amp; Glyn name for the branches it put up for sale \u2013 which were RBS banks in England and Wales together with NatWest branches in Scotland. However, it was unable to find a buyer.</p> <p>The closures affect branches across England and Wales, from Truro to Colwyn Bay and Barrow-in Furness, with 11 in London. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1xZ_PQySCbH5e-WVYR1LlrJrmMnJkk_kMbfslp_njBFs\" data-alt=\"List of bank branch closures\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1xZ_PQySCbH5e-WVYR1LlrJrmMnJkk_kMbfslp_njBFs\">List of bank branch closures</a> </figure>  <p>The bank said 109 brancheswould close in July and August and 53 would shut in November, with 792 staff to be made redundant.</p> <p>The latest closures come after years of shutting down branches, which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/01/rbs-natwest-to-axe-680-jobs-as-it-closes-259-branches\">prompted political outcries and warnings</a> about the end of high street banking. Only five months ago RBS announced it was closing 259 branches with the loss of 680 jobs.</p> <p>After the latest round of cuts the bank will have 859 branches remaining, about 1,000 fewer than at the end of 2014. Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury committee, criticised the RBS decision, and said the government may have to intervene if closures worsened financial exclusion. RBS is still 71%-owned by taxpayers.</p> <p>She said: <em>\u201c</em>In recent years, retail banks have made decisions to shrink their branch network on the grounds that more people are banking online. But branches remain vital for many, particularly vulnerable people and those in rural areas.</p> <p> \u201cAs a result of RBS\u2019s decision, there is a risk of increased levels of financial exclusion. It\u2019s important for the government to monitor this trend. If financial exclusion is increasing, the government may be required to intervene.\u201d</p> <p>Jonathan Reynolds, Labour\u2019s shadow City minister, said: \u201cThese closures and job losses are devastating for RBS staff and the communities they serve. Concrete plans must be put in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer as a result.</p> <p> \u201cUnder a Labour government, there would be mandatory consultation around the closure of bank branches which includes the regulator. We cannot abandon communities by leaving them without the basic banking infrastructure they need.\u201d</p> <p>The Unite union called on RBS to halt its \u201cdisastrous plans\u201d. It claimed that in 71 out of the 162 locations slated for closure, customers will be forced to make return journeys of about 25 miles.<br></p> <p>Unite\u2019s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: \u201cThe TSB computer systems crash last week has demonstrated without question that the banking system needs its branch network more than it ever has. Unite is calling on the Royal Bank of Scotland management not to abandon their responsibilities to communities across the country.\u201d</p> <p>RBS said the majority of branches marked for closure were within 0.6 miles of another RBS or NatWest branch, pointing out that all of them were within 2.5 miles of another branch.</p> <p>The bank also said the number of branch transactions in England and Wales had fallen 30% since 2014, while mobile transaction numbers had surged 74% over the same period. The number of customers using mobile banking has risen by 53%.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/27/rbs-profits-treble-792m-first-quarter-costs-fall\">RBS reported first-quarter profits had more than trebled to \u00a3792m</a>.</p> <p>The bank pledged to increase telephone banking services and improve online and app messaging services. It has created a specialist taskforce to help customers learn to use the new banking technology.</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses said the closures would deal another blow to small firms and high streets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The FSB\u2019s national chair, Mike Cherry, said: \u201cIt\u2019s thoroughly disappointing to see RBS using the failed sale of Williams &amp; Glyn as an excuse to further decimate the UK\u2019s bank branch network.</p> <p>\u201cThis fresh round of closures will hurt high streets all over the country at a time when thousands of small firms are already struggling. When a bank branch goes it means less footfall, less cash in the local economy and less revenue for local small firms as a result.</p> <p>He added that if small firms cannot easily deposit their takings, it makes them targets for theft. \u201cMany small business owners have built relationships with branch personnel that go back years \u2013 that\u2019s not something that can be replaced by an app.\u201d</p>",

In the mid to late 1990s Cambridge University ran an educational programme for senior managers with high potential. I directed it, recruited from industry for the purpose.

For the best emerging high flyers it aimed to illumine tomorrow\u2019s world and help them navigate and shape it. In its own limited way it offered the mind-expanding experience and honing of judgmental skills that had been espoused for a liberal university education by Cardinal Newman in the face of the utilitarianism of his own age (The Idea of the University Defined and Illustrated, 1873). I believe the approach that programme offered \u2013 eclectic, questioning, principled \u2013 was the opposite of the amoral, prescriptive reductionism of business schools so well described by Martin Parker.

      "bodyText": "TSB bosses will face intense questioning on Wednesday from MPs on the bank\u2019s catastrophic IT failure on Wednesday \u2013 as it emerged that, on the crucial first day of the month, standing orders from some customers went awry. As the embattled bank entered its 10th day of service failures, and as it began processing millions of payments set for the first day of the month, TSB admitted some customers were now having problems with their standing orders. The bank told customers: \u201cDirect debits are working normally. We know there are some issues with a small number of standing orders today, we are working hard to resolve these. Payments through our mobile app and internet banking are available, but we know some customers are experiencing difficulties at the moment and seeing an error message.\u201d Some TSB customers who have set up rent payments to go out on the first day of the month reported that their payments had been bounced back with no explanation. Customer Patrick Ryan wrote on Twitter: \u201cThis is going to cost me severe problems as I\u2019m now late with my rent. What the hell is going on?\u201d TSB chief executive Paul Pester, TSB chairman Richard Meddings and Miquel Montes, group chief operating officer at parent group Sabadell, will be forced to explain what really is going on to MPs on the Treasury committee, led by Nicky Morgan. So what are the key questions MPs will be firing at the bank\u2019s bosses? Why didn\u2019t the new computer system work? TSB spent, by its own admission, the equivalent of 2,500 human years on the IT transfer from Lloyds, with 1,000 people involved in one way or another. Why did it fail? Did TSB perform thorough testing prior to flicking the switch on the migration of user accounts? Why did the testing not uncover the issues? How thorough can it have been, given issues became apparent almost immediately? Was there a back-up? Sabadell\u2019s takeover of TSB was predicated almost entirely on the \u00a3100m savings to be made from cutting TSB free from the \u00a3214m-a-year bill it had to pay Lloyds for continuing to run the bank\u2019s accounts. Was it rushed through, without sufficient back-up? Why was the old system not still in place to mitigate customer troubles when it was clear Proteo4UK, the name given to the new platform, was not up to the task? Why were customers misinformed? The transition was scheduled from Friday evening to Sunday evening. When failures began appearing, almost immediately afterwards, TSB initially said the problems were only \u201cintermittent\u201d. Early on Wednesday, Pester said the system was \u201cup and running\u201d again but customers continued to report problems. Who was in control? Much is being made of a rift between TSB in the UK and Sabadell in Spain. Pictures on LinkedIn showed celebrating IT workers in Madrid toasting the \u201csuccess\u201d of the transfer. Pester is now paying for IBM specialists to fix the problems. Will Pester pin the blame on head office in Spain or other external contractors? Will Pester still receive a \u00a31.6m bonus? He may try to dodge this by saying bonuses are at the discretion of the remuneration committee, and nothing has been decided. But MPs are likely to press Pester on whether he think he deserves a bonus after this fiasco. How will TSB compensate customers? The bank has promised that no one will be left out of pocket. But will they receive compensation only if they complain? Will the bankcontact customers? And what does it expect the compensation bill to be? Did regulation work? MPs will want to know the extent to which the giant transfer of 1.3bn records was supervised by regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority, and what it says about the robustness of Britain\u2019s banking infrastructure. TSB will have to tell MPs how far the debacle has exposed customers\u2019 data, and how much, if at all, any accounts have been compromised.",

      "bodyText": "Climate change protesters have disrupted Barclays\u2019 annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday and were forcibly removed during an often fractious event, where the chief executive, Jes Staley, was accused of being \u201cirrevocably tarnished\u201d by his attempt to unmask a whistleblower. Campaigners from the student group People &amp; Planet said they were behind the protest, which lasted several minutes and brought the meeting at the QEII conference centre in London to a temporary halt. The group \u2013 which called for an end to the bank\u2019s financing of fossil fuel projects \u2013 attempted to rush the stage where Staley and the rest of the Barclays board were seated, before being tackled to the floor and carried out by security staff. \u201cWe know that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground to avoid climate chaos and that means no new fossil fuel infrastructure in the UK or anywhere,\u201d said Sam Leech, a member of P&amp;P. \u201cWe\u2019re here calling on Barclays to ditch fossil fuels in solidarity with communities resisting extraction globally.\u201d Earlier in the meeting a 22-year old activist, Ocean Hyland, asked the Barclays board to reconsider financing a Canadian pipeline project, carrying oil from the tar sands in Alberta through British Columbia to the coast. She said that her nation, the Tsleil-Waututh, believed the Kinder Morgan pipeline would cause environmental damage, threatening the surrounding lands, water and food sources with oil spills. Barclays said it was considering its investment and was working on a review of its approach to investments in oil and pipelines, with the aim of coming up with a new set of rules. The annual meeting proved a bruising encounter for Staley, who faced shareholders for the first time since UK regulators last month announced their intention to fine him an unspecified sum for a \u201cbreach of individual conduct\u201d. The scandal centred on Staley\u2019s attempts to uncover the identity of the author of letters sent to the Barclays board in 2016 raising concerns about the recruitment of Tim Main as head of the bank\u2019s financial institutions group in New York. \u201cYou say you have been in banking over 38 years, you should have known better than to bring shame on our bank,\u201d said Michael Mason-Mahon, a regular attendee and critic at Barclays\u2019 annual meetings. One investor told John McFarlane, Barclays\u2019 chair: \u201cThe chief executive is irrevocably tarnished. I suggest you consider his continuation.\u201d McFarlane repeatedly defended Staley and reiterated the board\u2019s unanimous support for the chief executive. \u201cI\u2019d be quite interested to know how many people in this room have never made a mistake?\u201d he asked shareholders. \u201cJes regrets his mistake. He does not deserve to resign.\u201d McFarlane said that more than 95% of shareholders agreed that Staley was still fit to run the bank. The board escaped a showdown with US-based activist investor Ed Bramson, who did not appear to have attended the annual meeting. Bramson\u2019s investment vehicle, Sherborne, has built a stake of more than 5% in the bank and is advocating a shake-up. McFarlane said that any speculation about his own future as chair was premature, adding that he intended to remain in the role for at least another year. \u201cYou are not getting rid of me yet,\u201d he told the meeting. Both Staley and McFarlane insisted the bank had reached a turning point, having dealt with most of its \u201clegacy issues\u201d, putting scandals such as Libor-rigging and PPI mis-selling behind them. McFarlane said the bank must avoid making any more major \u201cmistakes or missteps\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything necessary to get the growth and returns to get the higher share price you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he told shareholders. |I genuinely believe the best is yet to come.\u201d Staley said shareholders would be rewarded for the bank\u2019s progress with plans for the first programme of share buybacks in 20 years. He would not be drawn on timing. Staley also repeated a pledge to pay a dividend of 6.5p a share for 2018, after the dividend was left unchanged at 3p in 2017.",

Andy Haldane said researchers were increasingly looking at music download sites such as Spotify and studying the lyrics of songs to gauge the public mood. In a speech about the possibilities created by big data, Haldane said it was \u201cdevilishly difficult\u201d to work out how people felt because traditional surveys of market participants or the general public tended to be \u201cbiased in their sampling and framed in their responses\u201d. He said researchers were using non-traditional methods in an attempt to understand consumer behaviour. \u201cTo give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people\u2019s sentiment.\u201d Haldane said the results were at least as good at tracking consumer sentiment as the monthly Michigan University survey, which is considered by economists to be a good guide to how confident Americans are feeling. \u201cAnd why stop at music? People\u2019s tastes in books, TV and radio may also offer a window on their soul. So too might their taste in [computer] games,\u201d Haldane added. Multiplayer online games such as World of Warcraft already had \u201cprimitive\u201d economies attached to them that economists were studying, not only to gauge the public mood but also to assess how individuals would respond to policy changes such as moves in interest rates or tougher regulations. \u201cIndeed, in the latter role, the game could serve as a test bed for policy action \u2013 a large-scale dynamic, digital focus group.\u201d Haldane noted that not all attempts to harness online searches have been successful. Google tried to predict flu outbreaks based on online searches with little success after a promising start. But he expressed confidence that big data would fulfil its promise and help the Bank of England \u201cto create a real-time map of financial and activity flows across the economy, in much the same way as is already done for flows of traffic or information or weather. \u201cOnce mapped, there would then be scope to model and, through policy, modify these flows.

      "bodyText": "Heavy selling sent the pound tumbling to its lowest level against the US dollar in more than three months after a double dose of economic bad news convinced currency dealers that the Bank of England would ditch plans to raise interest rates next week. A sharper than expected slowdown in manufacturing and signs that hard-pressed consumers have lost their appetite for borrowing added to growing evidence that the UK economy has lost momentum since the turn of the year. Until recently, sterling has been rising against the dollar in the financial markets amid speculation that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) would tighten policy in response to above-target inflation and higher earnings growth. But City analysts said an array of recent poor economic data meant the MPC was now unlikely to risk raising official interest rates from their current level of 0.5%. The latest snapshot of manufacturing from the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) and the information company Markit and the Bank\u2019s own survey of money and credit conditions sent the pound tumbling in the foreign exchange markets. With dealers also growing increasingly confident that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, will raise interest rates again in June, the pound was trading at just over $1.36 against the dollar as business closed in the City. In the middle of April, it had risen to just over $1.43, close to its level before the EU referendum in June 2016. The closely watched purchasing managers\u2019 CIPS/Markit fell from 54.9 in March to 53.9 in April \u2013 suggesting that the slowing of the economy seen in the first quarter of 2018 continued into the second quarter. While any reading above 50 points to growing manufacturing output, the rate of expansion was the weakest in 17 months. The MPC will now be waiting for the CIPS/Markit survey of services to see whether other parts of the economy are also seeing a slowdown. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cThe further slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing activity suggests that the weaker official data seen last week wasn\u2019t a temporary aberration. A weaker start to the second quarter with a more subdued pace of growth in new overseas business perhaps reflects concerns about the erection of new barriers to trade, the recent pick up in sterling and a softer growth patch at the start of the year in European markets.\u201d Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, which compiled the manufacturing survey, said: \u201cThe start of the second quarter saw the UK manufacturing sector lose further steam. The headline PMI dipped to a 17-month low as growth of production, new business and employment all slowed. \u201cWhile adverse weather was partly to blame in February and March, there are no excuses for April\u2019s disappointing performance, making the chances of a near-term hike in interest rates by the Bank of England look increasingly remote.\u201d Meanwhile, the Bank of England\u2019s monthly money and credit statistics showed that unsecured lending to consumers stood at just \u00a3300m in March, the smallest increase since November 2012 and well down on the monthly average for the latest six months of \u00a31.5bn. The dramatic decline in consumer borrowing follows a clampdown by the chief financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, on bank lending to consumers, which grew by 10% or more on average between 2014 and 2017. In March, the annual growth rate in consumer credit dropped from 9.4% to 8.6%.Liz Martins, UK economist at HSBC, said the window for a rate rise from the Bank had closed as a result of recent soft economic data. \u201cToday\u2019s money and credit data were poor, but they are for March, and may reflect some weather effects. But the manufacturing PMI is for April, so it is the first piece of data we have for the second quarter. It does not make for a reassuring start.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP\u2019s profits jumped 71% during the first three months of the year, in the latest sign that the British oil company is back on the path to growth. The continued increase in crude and gas prices combined with a 6% rise in production to push profit up to $2.6bn (\u00a31.9bn), the firm\u2019s highest since 2014. Bob Dudley, the BP chief executive, said the company had delivered a strong set of results. Its share price rose to the highest level since 2010. While the growth in earnings was greater than its European peers, BP\u2019s profit was still lower than the Anglo-Dutch company Shell\u2019s $5.32bn and the French group Total\u2019s $2.9bn. Cash flow was nearly $1bn below what analysts had expected, at $5.4bn. BP also had a $1.6bn compensation bill for the Deepwater Horizon disaster, on top of the $65bn it has already paid out since the 2010 oil spill. Brian Gilvary, the BP chief financial officer, said the company had a \u201cpretty strong handle\u201d on what future payments looked like, as it begins to move on from the incident\u2019s financial burden. The company expects to pay out just over $3bn this year, including the $1.6bn, followed by about $2bn in 2019 and then about $1bn a year until 2032. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting more confidence around what that looks like [future payments]. The only uncertainty left now is 300 claims left to resolve,\u201d said Gilvary. While oil and gas production will dip in the second quarter because of maintenance and BP missing out on renewing its operations in Abu Dhabi, production for 2018 is expected to be up on last year. Gilvary said this would be driven by momentum from 2017 projects ramping up, as well as six new projects starting this year. He also hinted that investors could be rewarded by an increase in dividends in the second half of the year, saying the board would be talking about what conditions could see \u201ca move on the dividend\u201d. Dudley said 2018 would see BP \u201cdetermined to keep delivering our operational targets and maintaining capital discipline while growing cash flow and returns\u201d. Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that if the company\u2019s net debt went down in the next quarter from its current level of $40bn, \u201cBP will be well and truly on the road to recovery\u201d. The company is the latest oil major to benefit from a bullish oil price, which has climbed from about $67 a barrel at the start of the year to nearly $75. Brent crude averaged $67 a barrel in the first quarter, compared with $61 in the final quarter of 2017. The price of oil has been pushed up by Saudi and Russian-led production curbs, which have brought global supply and demand closer into balance. Geopolitical instability, including the prospect of Donald Trump not renewing the Iran nuclear deal later this month, has also been a driver. If the US president fails to renew the agreement, experts said Iranian oil exports could fall by about 1m barrels a day, pushing up crude prices significantly. \u201cIf that happened, Brent prices could jump to near $90,\u201d said Tomomichi Akuta, a senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo. Gilvary said the oil price was a \u201cbit frothy\u201d and would be influenced this year by Opec, US shale growth and global demand. However, he said: \u201cThere remain significant uncertainties including geopolitical risks and the possibility of further guidance from Opec.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s workers in Britain are striking in a dispute over zero-hours contracts and working conditions that is being closely observed by the fast food industry and trade unions. Staff from branches in Manchester and Watford will join colleagues in Crayford and Cambridge as part of a \u201cMcStrike\u201d as workers demand a minimum \u00a310-an-hour living wage. Members of the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union are also asking for a choice of fixed-hour contracts, the end of unequal pay for young workers, and union recognition. Employees at UK branches attracted worldwide attention in September by striking for the first time. Britain is one of McDonald\u2019s strongest markets, reporting 12 years of quarterly growth. While the numbers of employees taking strike action on Tuesday is small \u2013 just 11 are officially involved \u2013 one academic said the move was significant. Tony Royle, a professor of employment relations at the University of York, said the dispute was symbolic of the growing income gap, an increase in precarious work and a decline in independent trade union representation. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s is a multibillion-dollar corporation which continues to pay its senior executives sky-high salaries while paying low wages for the vast majority of its 2 million employees. \u201cYoung workers in particular have felt the brunt of the \u2018flexible\u2019 labour market and austerity government policies and are increasingly frustrated, angry and ready to fight for a more just workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s now 40 years since McDonald\u2019s entered the UK market. Today\u2019s strike and the strike in September 2017, despite McDonald\u2019s\u2019 attempts to play down and undermine [the action], could be the beginning of a shift in UK employment relations.\u201d McDonalds\u2019 employees won their biggest pay rise in 10 years in January, but it was banded by position, region, and age. Only company-owned McDonald\u2019s restaurants \u2013 about a quarter of branches in Britain \u2013 were affected. Annalise Peters, a worker at a McDonald\u2019s in Cambridge said: \u201cThe public and the labour movement have given us so much support and encouragement.\u201d Striking fast-food workers also plan to demonstrate in Watford, the hometown of McDonald\u2019s chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, as part of the industrial action. Lewis Baker, a McDonald\u2019s worker in Crayford, said: \u201cEvery message of support builds our confidence as we stand up to this bullying company and demand a fair wage and respect on the job.\u201d A McDonald\u2019s spokesman said on Tuesday afternoon that only one person had walked out across three strikes planned for the morning, while a maximum of of five people could walk out across the other two due to take place this afternoon. \u201cThe vast majority of our employees - across all stores, franchised and company-owned - received the annual pay rise in January, and the increase referred to within your piece started back in 2015. \u201cUnion recognition did not feature on the ballot paper, there is no suggestion this strike is calling for McDonald\u2019s to recognise the union. \u201cWe offered all 120,000 employees the chance to move to fixed hours contracts, more than 80% of them opted to stay on their existing contracts,\u201d she said. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell has written to McDonald\u2019s calling for a meeting to discuss the union\u2019s demands. McDonald\u2019s owns or franchises more than 37,000 restaurants in 120 countries.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s planned \u00a37.3bn takeover of Asda comes as the London-based supermarket continues to be outgunned by its three major rivals, according to the latest sales figures. Sainsbury\u2019s sales rose by just 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 22 April, its slowest pace of growth for more than a year. Asda\u2019s sales rose by 1.4% in the period, but the Leeds-based chain and Sainsbury\u2019s both lost market share, according to the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel, while Tesco and Morrisons held steady thanks to their turnaround plans. \u201cIt is very competitive out there for Sainsbury\u2019s,\u201d said Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel. \u201cHaving had a difficult couple of years, Morrisons is now doing the basics of retail very well and Tesco is not seeing hugely rapid growth but it is consistent. In the light of a zero-sum game for food retail that has put pressure on everybody else.\u201d Sales at Tesco rose by more than 2% for the first time since 2011, helping the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain retain a 27.6% share of the market compared with 15.9% at Sainsbury\u2019s and 15.5% at Asda. Morrisons also achieved sales growth in excess of 2% in line with the overall market. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to take market share as they increased sales by 7.7% and 9.1% respectively, helped by new stores openings. But analysts at Bernstein noted that the discounters\u2019 growth had slowed to the weakest pace since 2010, excluding a brief period in late 2016. Analyst Bruno Monteyne suggested the chains were finding it harder to secure new property. McKevitt said sales growth would now be harder to find for all supermarkets as grocery inflation is slowing. Prices rose by 2.1% in the 12-week period, the slowest pace since March last year, driven by increases in the cost of butter, bottled colas and bread, while the price of fresh poultry and laundry detergent fell.",
