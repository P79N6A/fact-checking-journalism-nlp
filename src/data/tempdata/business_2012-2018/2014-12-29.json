      "bodyText": "When on 30 December 1999 the FTSE 100 index closed at an all-time high of 6930.2, it did not make the next morning\u2019s front pages. At the time, it felt like nothing special \u2013 just another high for an index that, like its main US equivalents, had been setting records for months. Trading volumes had been thin, noted the Guardian in its report on page 21, because most investors were sitting on their hands to see if something called the millennium bug would throw the world\u2019s computers into chaos as the year turned. On the final day of 1999, a Friday, stock markets were to remain closed just in case. At the level of individual stocks, market reports of the day also read as if from another world. Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland, locked in a takeover battle for NatWest, were being closely watched. Shares in Marconi, half of GEC, rose 54p to \u00a310.96 on the now-famous day. Baltimore Technologies, another dotcom darling, hit a new high. Unpopular stocks of the time included Anglo-Dutch cleaning products group Reckitt Benckiser, fresh from a profits warning, and perennial plodder Associated British Foods. Brewer Whitbread, it was noted, had almost halved in value in 12 months. Life was about to change for all those companies and for the FTSE 100 index. The talked-about level of 7000 never arrived. The dotcom bubble burst in 2000, and 2001 brought the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US. By mid-March 2003, as coalition forces gathered to prepare for the invasion of Iraq, the index had fallen to 3,287. Having since then gone through a sharp recovery (2003-2007) and a financial crash (2008-09), the main index this year once again recalled 1999\u2019s high but without quite getting there. It came within 100 points during three months of 2014 (February, May and September) and was nearly 300 points adrift of that millennial peak last night. Whether it will get there in 2015 is anybody\u2019s guess, but the question needs to be put in context. The current standing of the FTSE 100 does not mean that the market has taken 15 years to retrace most of its steps. The missing ingredient is dividend income. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, calculated that a person who had invested \u00a310,000 in the FTSE 100 on 30 December 1999 \u2013 in other words, at the worst possible time \u2013 would now be sitting on slightly more than \u00a315,000 if he or she had reinvested dividends. A 50% return over 15 years is poor but it\u2019s not zero. If your investment horizons are broader than the FTSE 100, your performance ought to have been better. Khalaf\u2019s calculations show that a sum of \u00a310,000 invested on the same day in the FTSE 250 index, containing the next 250 largest companies with a main market listing in London, would now be worth about \u00a324,000, or slightly more than \u00a336,000 with dividends reinvested. Another point to remember is that the FTSE 100 reflects nothing other than the share prices of its constituent members, which are reviewed quarterly. It is not, and never was, a barometer of the health of UK plc. Aside from the banks, the index is dominated by multinationals, most of which make a small fraction of their sales in the UK. The expanded crew of miners \u2013 led by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto \u2013 are not here to look for iron ore. The real moral of the tale is to pick your stocks carefully. Of those companies mentioned in the contemporaneous market reports, Baltimore disappeared in no time. Marconi, having paid for its disastrous top-of-the-market telecoms purchases in cash rather than shares, stumbled from disaster to disaster. Success in the NatWest battle did not halt Royal Bank of Scotland, but its next big purchase, ABN Amro in 2007, did. By then, Bank of Scotland had been shunted into HBOS, the other great British banking disaster-in-the-making. On the other side of the ledger, that trio of 1999 laggards became fortune-makers. AB Foods discovered a gem within its midst called Primark and became a sprinter rather than a plodder; its share price has travelled from 340p to \u00a332.11. Reckitt Benckiser found focus and cost savings and has gone from 650p to \u00a352.15. Whitbread gave up brewing to concentrate on Costa Coffee and Premier Inn; its shares have risen from 600p to \u00a347.26 this century. One of these years, the FTSE 100 will finally reach 7000 and it probably will be front-page \u2013 or front of the website \u2013 news. But the serious money will still be won and lost on the stocks within the index.",

      "bodyText": "There was an immediate knee-jerk reaction to the news that Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras had failed to muster enough support to win the third and final presidential vote, with markets falling back and Greek bond yields soaring. The outcome of a snap election is causing much uncertainty about the outlook for the country\u2019s political status and the prospects for its bailout agreement. Syriza, the party in the lead in the polls, wants to renegotiate the bailout terms, while the likes of Germany are warning Greece to stick to its agreements. But a growing feeling that Greece\u2019s situation, while serious, may not have an immediate knock on effect on the rest of the eurozone, helped markets recover lost ground. The most affected were the Athens market - despite recovering from its worst levels - and Spain and Italy, on fears they were the likeliest to be hit by any contagion. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 23.58 points or 0.36% higher at 6633.51 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.05% to 9927.13 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.51% better at 4317.93 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.15% to 19,130.02 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.84% to 10,394.2 The Athens market dropped 3.91% to 819.81 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently almost unchanged, down just 4.5 points or 0.02%. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The Athens stock market has closed down 3.91%, a recovery from its earlier fall of 11% or so immediately after the news that a snap election would be called. But yields on Greek 10 year bonds are currently at 9.7%, as investors baulked at the uncertainty now surrounding the country\u2019s political and economic future. And let\u2019s not forget Russia. Fitch has just revised its outlook on 20 mid-sized and small Russian banks to negative from stable. The agency believes \u201c the sharp deterioration in the Russian operating environment will negatively impact the banks\u2019 credit profiles in 2015.\u201d The banks include Credit Bank of Moscow, Bank Saint Petersburg OJSC, Bank Zenit, Absolut Bank and, Uraltransbank. Fitch said: The revision of the banks\u2019 outlooks to negative reflects Fitch\u2019s expectation that economic recession, significantly increased funding costs, sharp rouble depreciation, closed wholesale funding markets, a challenging liquidity situation and rising inflation will weigh on the banks\u2019 credit profiles. At the same time, the affirmation of the banks\u2019 ratings reflects (i) their moderate resilience to the weaker operating environment, as financial metrics are for the most part currently reasonable; and (ii) sovereign support for the sector, in the form of regulatory forbearance, liquidity provision and potential capital injections, which should reduce near-term pressures. The full comments are here. Over in the US, and a disappointing figure for Texas manufacturing activity. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u2019 monthly business activity index plunged to 4.1 in December, compared to 10.5 the previous month and expectations of a dip to around 9. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has warned Greece to stick to its economic reforms, and said any new government would be held to the agreements made by Antonis Samaras\u2019s current administration. Reuters reports: \u201cThe tough reforms are bearing fruit and there is no alternative to them,\u201d Schaeuble said after Greek lawmakers triggered an early election by failing to a elect a new president in a decisive third round of voting in parliament. \u201cWe will continue to help Greece help itself on its path of reform. If Greece takes another path, it will be difficult,\u201d Schaeuble added. \u201cNew elections will not change the agreements we have struck with the Greek government. Any new government will have to stick to the agreements made by its predecessor.\u201d Samaras said after the vote in parliament on Monday that he would propose January 25 as the date for a general election. Polls suggest that left-wing Syriza, which rejects the terms of Greece\u2019s euro zone bailouts, will emerge as the strongest party in the election. Back with Greece. and the International Monetary Fund, one of the counry\u2019s troika of lenders, has said talks on the next review would take place one the new government was formed, and that Greece had no immediate financing worries. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said: Discussions with the Greek authorities on the completion of the 6th review of the program that is being supported by an Extended Arrangement will resume once a new government is in place, in consultation with the European Commission and the European Central Bank. Greece faces no immediate financing needs. Turning back to City Link, there was no sign of anger about the handling of the insolvency at one of the company\u2019s London depots this morning. The Guardian\u2019s Josh Halliday has sent this report. RMT organisers reported \u201cscenes of absolute chaos\u201d at CityLink depots across the country, but there was barely a trace of turmoil at the firm\u2019s delivery centre in Bermondsey, southeast London. People arrived in more of a trickle than a flood when CityLink opened its gates for the first time since the company announced its collapse on Christmas Eve. An orderly queue of up to four people formed at the front desk, with customers reporting waiting times of between 15 minutes and an hour an a half. Any sign of staff tumult appeared to have long since subsided. \u201cThere were people here two weeks ago screaming that they wanted to get paid,\u201d said one volunteer at a homeless charity based across the road from the depot. \u201cBut since then the gates have been locked. I haven\u2019t heard of anything unpleasant going on.\u201d Many of those who turned up to collect parcels heard about the company\u2019s misfortune on the television news, but some remained oblivious. \u201cHas it really? Oh, I didn\u2019t know that!\u201d said Minguyan Li, 24, when told CityLink had gone bust. \u201cTheir service is not so good for me. They announced their opening times but they don\u2019t follow them. This is the third time I\u2019ve been here to collect my parcel.\u201d US markets have opened mostly flat on what is expected to be a day of quiet trading. The FTSE100 is also flat, although European markets are slightly down because of the Greek vote. Greek\u2019s main stock market, the ATG, has pared its earlier losses. FTSEEurofirst -0.35% at 1370 points ATG -4.1% at 818 points Time for a lunchtime summary: Greece is heading for snap elections, after Stavros Dimas failed to win enough votes to become president. Prime minister Antonis Samaras had a mandate until mid 2016 for his coalition government, but had promised to bring forward the poll if Dimas, the only candidate, did not win the largely ceremonial post. Dimas won 168 votes in a third and final round of voting - 12 votes short of the super majority he needed. The election is likely to be held on 25 January and could plunge Greece into political chaos, as leading opposition party Syriza has vowed to re-negotiate the country\u2019s eurozone bailout. Read more here Greece plunged into crisis as failure to elect president sets up snap election And Russia\u2019s economy shrank in November for the first time since the financial crisis in 2o09. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia group, gives his verdict on Greece. Speaking of the ECB, it is worth catching up with this interview with Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank and member of the ECB\u2019s governing council. In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung he said the situation in Europe \u201cisn\u2019t as bad as some people believe\u201d. As things are at the moment and if oil prices remain this low, inflation will be lower than expected, but growth will be better. Weidmann is known for his opposition to turning on the money taps of quantitative easing. (With low oil prices) an economic stimulus program has been handed to us, why should we add to that with monetary policy?\u201d \u201cI am irritated by one question dominating the recent public debate: when will you finally buy?\u201d The European Central Bank has issued its statement on the Greek vote. No big surprises, but for the record: It is now for the Greek electorate to decide about the future composition of the parliament and the government. We will not interfere in or comment on this democratic process. We will wait for the views and suggestions of the Greek authorities on how to best proceed with the review, and we will discuss this with the European Commission and the IMF. Once again, those publicity-conscious folks at Ladbrokes have not missed a trick. The bookmaker has cut the odds of a Greek exit from the euro in 2015 to evens from 2/1. It said: The betting firmly suggests 2015 will be a pivotal year for the stability of the Eurozone. Contagion? What contagion? Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi has insisted that Italy will not be affected by further economic turmoil as a result of Greece\u2019s political instability. Speaking at a year end news conference, he said: I feel that I can totally exclude a contagion effect between Greece and Italy, which are profoundly different countries. Syriza might conjure up red-flag economics, but its programme for Greece is basic Keynesianism, according to Paul Mason of Channel 4 News. Here is an extract from his blog on how the party has changed in two years. Two years ago I sat in the HQ of Syriza waiting for a very close election result. \u201cThank god, we\u2019ve lost. That\u2019s great for us,\u201d said one of the party\u2019s journalists as they greeted me. You could see why: they were not prepared for power - the entire party records were in six or seven box files on the shelf next to me. But in the past two years Syriza has professionalised, mounted a fairly consistently slick performance as the official parliamentary opposition, and moderated its demands. Instead of cancelling the debts to the EU and IMF, it wants to negotiate half of them away. It is pledged to something George Osborne will only achieve in 2018 - a balanced budget. So even as the symbolism of moderate Marxism is plastered all over Syriza, in reality its programme for Greece is mainstream Keynesian economics. Courtesy of his blog, I have also stumbled across this quiz: are you Syriza enough? Greeks are already starting to get advice in the wake of the election call, including from the European Commission\u2019s Pierre Moscovici who said (according to Reuters snaps) that it was essential for Greek leaders and voters to support growth friendly reforms for Greece to thrive again. Think tank Open Europe has been looking at the implications of the forthcoming Greek election, and the uncertainty it has caused. For a start, there will be questions about whether Greece can meet the conditions of its recent bailout extension. Open Europe says: The deal allowed the country an extra two months to complete some further reforms and for the EU/IMF/ECB Troika to complete its current bailout review. However, the first two weeks of this period have been spent on the presidential vote \u2013 little time has been spent taking action. Now the parliament is to be dissolved, meaning that nothing can happen for at least a month or six weeks \u2013 and certainly no new legislation can be passed. Some work will continue behind the scenes, but with the political establishment in full election mode, minds will be elsewhere. Furthermore, the landscape could fundamentally change after the elections, providing an excuse to delay any radical reforms. After the election, the new parliament will still have to elect a president, which could again prove tricky depending on how stable the government is. It will then have to negotiate an exit from the bailout and fill Greece\u2019s funding gap of several billions over the next few years: The window to work in here is small meaning the pressure will be on, reducing the room for manoeuvre. With the bailout finishing at the end of February the new government will have little time to secure a deal or face cash shortages in the following months. The negotiations over the future role of the IMF will be particularly fraught, with many in Greece keen to see them leave but with eurozone partners wanting the funds involvement to continue. Fundamentally, Greece and the Eurozone will have to face up to the question of debt restructuring for the first time in two years \u2013 an issue many incorrectly thought had been put to bed. Open Europe also assesses the risks to the eurozone: It has once again been clear from this episode that financial market jitters in Greece are now largely contained, there has been little to no spill over into other Eurozone countries. That said, what happens in Greece could have important implications. If SYRIZA come to power, many could see it as a dry run for what might happen in the Spanish elections due at the end of 2015, in which [anti-austerily party] Podemos are expected to make huge gains and possibly be the largest party. Similarly, SYRIZA are seen by many as the template which a number of populist/anti-austerity parties are trying to follow. This is driven home by the fact that Pablo Iglesias, the leader of... Podemos, tweeted the following earlier today, \u201c2015 will be the year of change in Spain and Europe. We will start from Greece. Come on, Alexis! Come on, SYRIZA!\u201d. The negotiations over Greece\u2019s debt will also be seen a precedent. Any deal or restructuring offered to Greece may have to be offered to other countries, particularly those who took bailouts and have very high debt levels (both Ireland and Portugal qualify). The conditionality will also be scrutinised, particularly at a time when France and Italy are pushing back against the strict reform and fiscal consolidation criteria. Any additional room given to Greece will be noted and demanded by other eurozone states. As has often been the case, Greece may once again become a testing ground for the next round of Eurozone crisis policies. The full report is here: New crisis looms in Greece as snap elections are to be called Market analysts are gazing into their crystal balls, as they ponder what the Greek vote will mean for the rest of the eurozone. The European Central Bank is due to hold its next monetary policy meeting on 22 January - just three days before the Greek vote. So, could this be the moment for the ECB to finally wow the markets with financial stimulus? Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, thinks the Greek vote will intensify the European debate over austerity. Although this [vote] is a specific issue for Greece it will raise fresh fears over the fate of the eurozone and the timelines for the possible implementation of a European version of QE. 2015 could see an escalation in the debate over austerity, with the same old north-south divide on what is proportional still raging. Greece\u2019s main stock market, the Athex General Composite Share Price Index, is *only* down 7.2% at the moment. The ATG has clawed back some of its losses, having fallen almost 8% before the vote took place. It seems investors had already decided the government would fail to win the vote: the Greek stock market has lost one third of its value in 2014. The view from the Greek government ... and opposition leader Alexis Tsipras. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has called elections for 25 January, reports the Associated Press. Finland\u2019s prime minister Alexander Stubb is one of the first European leaders to react to the Greek vote. It is worth pointing out that Finland has been a prominent supporter of the EU\u2019s austerity policies. The most likely date for Greece\u2019s early election is either 25 January or 1 February. Prime minister Antonis Samaras has called a cabinet meeting for 2pm local time (12.00 GMT), and we are expecting a further statement later. For those who enjoy electoral inquests, we now have the breakdown of today\u2019s crucial Greek vote. In a third and final round of voting, Stavros Dimas won 168 votes. He was supported by 127 New Democracy (centre-right) and 28 Pasok (socialist) deputies. A total of 132 MPs declined to back him, including 71 Syriza deputies, 16 from far-right party Golden Dawn, 12 from the Communist party and 9 from the Democratic Left party. A handful of independent deputies voted for Dimas, but not enough to get him to the 180 votes required. More snaps from Reuters Greek PM says we will not allow anyone to put Greece\u2019s place in Europe in question German government spokeswoman says watching closely what is happening in Greece, declines to comment in detail on Greek vote result. The triggering of snap elections comes as no great surprise to political commentators in Greece. Nick Malkoutzis, deputy editor of the English edition of Kathimerini, argues that prime minister Antonis Samaras never had any intention of building consensus. He accuses Samaras of lacklustre campaigning for presidential candidate Stavros Dimas. There has been a distinct sense over recent weeks that the government has lost the appetite to see through the adjustment programme it has repeatedly argued is the only option for Greece to exit the crisis. The final troika review was meant to be wrapped up within a few weeks of the meetings in Paris in early September. However, as the review dragged on so it became apparent that the government did not have the political will (and perhaps the necessary votes in Parliament) to push things over the line. Each troika demand squeezed a little more life out of the coalition until it became clear that a new plan had to be devised. At this point, Samaras made what was a deeply political calculation: He realised that passing the latest clutch of troika demands through Parliament would guarantee that his government had no chance of electing a president in February and would force it to go to national polls having only just approved a new round of unpopular measures. In these circumstances, bringing forward the presidential vote gave the coalition a slightly better chance of success or, if snap elections were not avoided, meant that a SYRIZA or SYRIZA-led government would be left with the task of closing out the troika negotiations. You can read his article on the excellent Macropolis site here The leader of the left-wing opposition party Syriza, Alexis Tsipras, has made his first comments on the presidential election result. Headlines on Reuters: \u201cIn a few days austerity bailouts will be a thing of the past.\u201d \u201cLawmakers proved democracy cannot be blackmailed.\u201d I\u2019ll bring you more as I get it. A prediction for 2015 from the Guardian\u2019s data editor Alberto Nardelli. Greek bonds continued to track upwards following the vote, while German bonds fell to record lows. Yields on Greece\u2019s 10-year bonds have risen 9% on the day, reflecting investors\u2019 expectation that a debt default is more likely. German bonds, a safe haven in any financial storm, fell to a record low: yields on 10-yr German bonds have dropped to 0.564%. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s man in Brussels, Bruno Waterfield, sets out the EU calendar following the Greek vote. The eurozone crisis is back... And it is confirmed: Greece is heading for elections that could derail the country\u2019s international bailout programme. Stavros Dimas, the only candidate in the race, failed to win the 180 majority he needed to become president. He won 168 votes, the same number he won in the second round of the vote. Greece heading for snap elections - Macropolis The vote is underway. Greek ferry update: rescue teams are working to save 149 people from the burning ferry, according to the latest from Reuters. A tug boat was expected to reach the ship to make another rescue attempt by 10 am local time, Greece\u2019s shipping minister Miltiadis Varvitsiotis told Skai TV. Labour MP Chris Bryant gives his verdict on Mervyn King\u2019s interview of Ben Bernanke. Greek vote - timeline Voting on the Greek presidential election is due to be getting underway around now. The results are expected around 1pm local time (11am GMT). Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has called a cabinet meeting for 2 p.m. According to Ekathimerini, if Stavros Dimas, the only candidate, is not elected Parliament has to be dissolved within 10 days and snap elections called within the following 30 days. The most likely date for the early general elections would be January 25 or February 1. Greek bond yields are rising this morning, reflecting investor concern that the government is more likely to default on its debts. Greek 10-year bond yields are up 29 basis points to 8.82% Greek 3-year bond yields are up 97 basis points to 83.7%. The voting starts in around five minutes... The latest polls show that Stavros Dimas will fall just short of the 180 votes he needs to be elected Greek president. Today\u2019s Greek vote comes as the country waits anxiously for the rescue of more than 200 people trapped on a burning ferry. Rescue teams working through the night have pulled 265 people off the car ferry, but more than 200 are stranded on board, the Italian navy said on Monday. Full story: Rescuers battle through night to save passengers on burning Italian ferry Third photo provided by Italian navy With just over half an hour to go until Greek deputies vote, investors are still selling. Greece\u2019s ATG index has extended its losses, and is now down 7.76% on market opening. Russia\u2019s economy contracted in November for the first time since the global financial crisis hit the country in 2009. Data from the economy ministry showed that November GDP was down 0.5% on 2013. The global financial crisis that tipped the western world into the longest downturn since the 1930s. We remember that. Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England, also remembers the crisis as something of a career high. He has been recalling the UK\u2019s response to the financial crisis on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. It was exciting and it was fascinating and it was the sort of problem that we had trained to deal with over many years. So I think both Ben [Bernanke, then chair of the US Federal Reserve] and I felt that having spent a good deal of time thinking through the intellectual foundations of what to do with a banking crisis and the opportunity to deal with one was one that we were well prepared for. Lord King was guest editing the Today programme and interviewed Bernanke, who said central bankers tried not to think of the global consequences of their actions to help focus on their response to the crisis. Ben Bernanke: It certainly was a lot of stress; the crisis was so complicated, there were so many different aspects to it and the response of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England was so complex and so many moving parts that I felt like a pilot in a cockpit, always trying to keep my eye on every light that was going red. So by focusing so much on the individual task, we tried not to be thinking all the time about the consequences for the world of these decisions and that seemed to help somewhat. While we have Greece on our minds, here is another highlight from the interview. Lord King: Greece did not prevent something terrible happening, Greece has been through a repetition of the Great Depression as far as it\u2019s concerned. Via Press Association The TUC has called on the government to reverse laws that make it easier to sack workers, following the City Link collapse. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC said: The fast track sackings at City Link are a prime example of the unacceptable face of casualised Britain, with workers denied even basic rights to proper consultation. But there is nothing inevitable about this company going bust. Too many employers are using insolvency to take the money and run, leaving the taxpayer to foot the redundancy bill. The government must get a grip and reverse the changes in the law they introduced to make sacking workers in Britain so cheap and easy. Vince Cable should urgently meet with the union and administrators to explore alternatives before it\u2019s too late. Investors are in a jittery mood ahead of this morning\u2019s presidential vote in Athens. Greece\u2019s main stock market, the ATG index, is down 5% this morning. Private equity firm Better Capital has mounted a defence over the timing of the City Link collapse, after unions demanded an investigation into the announcement. In a statement issued to investors issued today, the firm said the decision to appoint administrators was leaked to the media, leading to employees finding out the bad news on Christmas day. Unfortunately the appointment of an administrator was leaked to the media ahead of the intended announcement. The directors very much regret the impact on the employees of City Link receiving such bad news on Christmas Day. Administrators at Ernst &amp; Young were appointed on 24 December. The private equity owner who oversaw the collapse of City Link has delivered a combative message, as it emerges that the taxpayer will pick up the bill for redundancy payments to nearly 3,000 workers at the parcel delivery firm. Jon Moulton, the founder of Better Capital, the private equity firm that bought City Link for \u00a31 in 2013, said he had nothing to apologise for. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any need to apologise for the process that we\u2019ve followed. That doesn\u2019t make it a pleasant process \u2014 or a nice outcome.\u201d I\u2019ve taken this quote from the FT, but Moulton has also been on the Today programme with a similar message. We chased every possible way to save this company. As BBC Business blog summarises: He says the company had simply failed, and that delaying the closure over Christmas had not been an option, as trading while insolvent was a criminal offence. Could the affair have been better handled? Not particularly, no. That is certainly not the view of trade unions. Here is RMT general secretary Mick Cash: It says everything about the state of industry in Britain today that a donor to the party of government can wreck the lives of thousands of people, walk away and leave the taxpayer to pick up the redundancy costs. Moulton was a Tory party donor until 2012. The Russian rouble has fallen 3.6% against the dollar this morning. The rouble was trading at around 57 to the dollar and 68 to the euro in early trading. On Friday, the Russian currency hit its strongest levels in more than three weeks against the dollar, but remained well off the 35-40 bracket it was trading in around a year ago. According to Reuters economics team in Moscow, the currency is down this morning, because exporters are reducing sales of foreign currency after having accumulated enough roubles to meet their end-of-month tax payments. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Greece is on the verge of a crucial vote that will determine the future of the country\u2019s international bailout, with consequences that will reverberate around Europe. Greek lawmakers will vote today for a president to take over from 85-year Karolos Papoulias. The only candidate is Stavros Dimas, a former European commissioner for Greece on the centre right, who needs 180 votes to be elected. But failure to win will trigger a general election that could bring the leftwing Syriza party to power. Syriza, who are already preparing for an election, want to renegotiate Greece\u2019s multi-billion euro bailout agreement with the European Union and International Monetary Fund and roll back the austerity policies. Greece\u2019s prime minister Antonis Samaras has been urging deputies to back his man, calling on them to \u201cunderstand that the reforms we\u2019ve shed blood to build in the past three years could be reversed in a single day\u201d. Here is the Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith in Athens on what it all means. What happens in parliament on Monday will not only define the course of Greece but of Europe. If Samaras wins, it will be a huge vote of confidence for a man who, despite being a critic of austerity, has implemented policies at the behest of other EU lenders to keep his country solvent. But if the presidential election fails to deliver his man, and snap polls are called as the Greek constitution stipulates, radical insurgents bent on overturning that order are on course to triumph. More background reading here The vote is at midday local time (10.00 GMT) and we should get the results within an hour. Apart from that, I\u2019ll be getting the latest on the collapse of City Link, the parcel delivery firm that went bust on Christmas Day.",

Open Europe says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The deal allowed the country an extra two months to complete some further reforms and for the EU/IMF/ECB Troika to complete its current bailout review. However, the first two weeks of this period have been spent on the presidential vote \u2013 little time has been spent taking action. Now the parliament is to be dissolved, meaning that nothing can happen for at least a month or six weeks \u2013 and certainly no new legislation can be passed. Some work will continue behind the scenes, but with the political establishment in full election mode, minds will be elsewhere. Furthermore, the landscape could fundamentally change after the elections, providing an excuse to delay any radical reforms.</p> </blockquote> <p>After the election, the new parliament will still have to elect a president, which could again prove tricky depending on how stable the government is.</p> <p>It will then have to negotiate an exit from the bailout and fill Greece\u2019s funding gap of several billions over the next few years:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The window to work in here is small meaning the pressure will be on, reducing the room for manoeuvre. With the bailout finishing at the end of February the new government will have little time to secure a deal or face cash shortages in the following months. The negotiations over the future role of the IMF will be particularly fraught, with many in Greece keen to see them leave but with eurozone partners wanting the funds involvement to continue. Fundamentally, Greece and the Eurozone will have to face up to the question of debt restructuring for the first time in two years \u2013 an issue many incorrectly thought had been put to bed.</p> </blockquote> <p> Open Europe also assesses the risks to the eurozone:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has once again been clear from this episode that financial market jitters in Greece are now largely contained, there has been little to no spill over into other Eurozone countries.</p> <p>That said, what happens in Greece could have important implications. If SYRIZA come to power, many could see it as a dry run for what might happen in the Spanish elections due at the end of 2015, in which [anti-austerily party] Podemos are expected to make huge gains and possibly be the largest party. Similarly, SYRIZA are seen by many as the template which a number of populist/anti-austerity parties are trying to follow. This is driven home by the fact that Pablo Iglesias, the leader of... Podemos, tweeted the following earlier today, \u201c2015 will be the year of change in Spain and Europe. We will start from Greece. Come on, Alexis! Come on, SYRIZA!\u201d.</p> <p>The negotiations over Greece\u2019s debt will also be seen a precedent. Any deal or restructuring offered to Greece may have to be offered to other countries, particularly those who took bailouts and have very high debt levels (both Ireland and Portugal qualify). The conditionality will also be scrutinised, particularly at a time when France and Italy are pushing back against the strict reform and fiscal consolidation criteria. Any additional room given to Greece will be noted and demanded by other eurozone states. As has often been the case, Greece may once again become a testing ground for the next round of Eurozone crisis policies.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full report is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/new-crisis-looms-greece-snap-elections-called/\">New crisis looms in Greece as snap elections are to be called</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54a1415ce4b084424a7b2c50\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-29T12:05:05.165Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Market analysts are gazing into their crystal balls, as they ponder what the Greek vote will mean for the rest of the eurozone.<br></p> <p>The European Central Bank is due to hold its next monetary policy meeting on 22 January - just three days before the Greek vote.</p> <p>So, could this be the moment for the ECB <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2014/dec/04/european-central-bank-qe-signal-mario-draghi-business-live\">to finally wow the markets with financial stimulus?</a><br></p> <p><strong>Alastair McCaig</strong>, market analyst at IG, thinks the Greek vote will intensify the European debate over austerity.<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although this [vote] is a specific issue for Greece it will raise fresh fears over the fate of the eurozone and the timelines for the possible implementation of a European version of QE. 2015 could see an escalation in the debate over austerity, with the same old north-south divide on what is proportional still raging.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54a13f9ce4b084424a7b2c4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-29T11:55:31.395Z\">11.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece\u2019s main stock market, the Athex General Composite Share Price Index, is *only* down 7.2% at the moment.</p> <p>The ATG has clawed back some of its losses, having fallen almost 8% before the vote took place.

He accuses Samaras of lacklustre campaigning for presidential candidate Stavros Dimas.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been a distinct sense over recent weeks that the government has lost the appetite to see through the adjustment programme it has repeatedly argued is the only option for Greece to exit the crisis. The final troika review was meant to be wrapped up within a few weeks of the meetings in Paris in early September. However, as the review dragged on so it became apparent that the government did not have the political will (and perhaps the necessary votes in Parliament) to push things over the line. Each troika demand squeezed a little more life out of the coalition until it became clear that a new plan had to be devised.</p> <p>At this point, Samaras made what was a deeply political calculation: He realised that passing the latest clutch of troika demands through Parliament would guarantee that his government had no chance of electing a president in February and would force it to go to national polls having only just approved a new round of unpopular measures. In these circumstances, bringing forward the presidential vote gave the coalition a slightly better chance of success or, if snap elections were not avoided, meant that a SYRIZA or SYRIZA-led government would be left with the task of closing out the troika negotiations.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read his article on the excellent Macropolis site <a href=\"http://How snap elections in Greece fit into Samaras's strategy - See more at: http://www.macropolis.gr/?i=portal.en.the-agora.2062#sthash.00xWp2wG.x6vpdVBc.dpuf\">here</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54a134e1e4b048dfa405390a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-29T11:05:31.982Z\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The leader of the left-wing opposition party Syriza, Alexis Tsipras, has made his first comments on the presidential election result.</p> <p>Headlines on Reuters:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIn a few days austerity bailouts will be a thing of the past.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLawmakers proved democracy cannot be blackmailed.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><br><em>I\u2019ll bring you more as I get it.<br></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54a13366e4b06182e1ed8a2e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-29T10:57:32.176Z\">10.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A prediction for 2015 from the Guardian\u2019s data editor Alberto Nardelli.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlbertoNardelli/statuses/549516411853615104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Greece, Spain, Sweden, UK, Poland, Denmark. 2015 will be a year of unlikely coalitions and political fragmentation in Europe.</p>&mdash; Alberto Nardelli (@AlbertoNardelli) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlbertoNardelli/status/549516411853615104\">December 29, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54a131f1e4b06182e1ed8a2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-29T10:54:25.196Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greek bonds continued to track upwards following the vote, while German bonds fell to record lows.</p> <p>Yields on Greece\u2019s 10-year bonds have risen 9% on the day, reflecting investors\u2019 expectation that a debt default is more likely.</p> <p>German bonds, a safe haven in any financial storm, fell to a record low: yields on 10-yr German bonds have dropped to 0.564%. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54a1316ee4b084424a7b2c41\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-29T10:49:33.261Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Daily Telegraph\u2019s man in Brussels, Bruno Waterfield, sets out the EU calendar following the Greek vote.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bruno Waterfield\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Election date must be announced within 10 days - 25 Jan or 1 Feb expected. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUCO?src=hash&quot;&gt;#EUCO&lt;/a&gt; summit of EU leaders on 12 Feb, eurogroup on 16 Feb&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bruno Waterfield (@BrunoBrussels) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/status/549515455762026497&quot;&gt;December 29, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54a13057e4b048dfa4053906\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-12-29T10:46:11.685Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The eurozone crisis is back...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/statuses/549514518997762048\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Greece heading for elections - eurozone crisis is back, now it&#39;s political</p>&mdash; Bruno Waterfield (@BrunoBrussels) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrunoBrussels/status/549514518997762048\">December 29, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MatinaStevis/statuses/549515851049996288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> enters period of political turmoil.

The bonus for Mark Carne, who is under fire for being on holiday at the time of the disruption, could be no larger than \u00a333,000 because of the company\u2019s performance. He said he agreed with the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, that the industry should conduct a wider review into whether it is wise to try to concentrate so much engineering work into the Christmas or Easter period on the basis that fewer people travel during those times. Robin Gisby, Network Rail\u2019s managing director of operations, who was responsible for the engineering overruns that caused the cancellation of all trains in and out London King\u2019s Cross on Saturday, is to forfeit a golden goodbye. Gisby was earmarked to receive a bonus of up to \u00a3371,000, but Network Rail said he would be leaving in February without any additional payment beyond that stipulated in his contract.

Travellers were told to use Finsbury Park instead, but there were chaotic scenes at the north London station which was temporarily closed owing to overcrowding. Angry travellers vented their frustration on social media and politicians joined in the condemnation ,with McLoughlin describing the situation as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. On Saturday, Gisby apologised for the problems but defended the decisions that led to King\u2019s Cross being closed. Previous pleas from politicians and the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) for the Network Rail remuneration committee to take into account poor performance have largely been ignored. But paying Gisby a bonus of more than \u00a3300,000 after the latest problems would have been likely to lead to an outcry. Louise Ellman, the Labour MP and chair of the transport select committee, has said she is likely to summon Network Rail executives to explain what happened, including the nature of the planning undertaken and whether enough senior staff had been at work to oversee the repairs. The ORR could, as it has previously, fine Network Rail for overrunning engineering work but customers could end up footing the bill through increased rail fares. There were further delays on the rail network on Monday, as many people returned to work after the Christmas break. In East Anglia, where passengers have been plagued by problems over recent weeks, a broken-down train meant there was no service between Ipswich and Felixstowe, with buses having to operate in the morning rush-hour instead. Another major engineering project over Christmas involved the part-closure of the west coast main line between Euston, London, and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire.

      "body": "<p>In its final week, the 113th US Congress managed to pass a spending bill loaded with policy giveaways to special interests, and a year-long extension of mostly corporate tax breaks. <br></p> <p>But they couldn\u2019t finish off the lobbyist Triple Crown. There was one task Congress couldn\u2019t tackle: approve an extension of the Terrorist Risk Insurance Act, known as TRIA. The bill provides lucrative government bailout protection for the insurance industry in case of a terrorist attack like 9/11 or, as Hollywood has feared, retribution for American entertainment choices by North Korea. <br></p> <p>Although both Democrats and Republicans, motivated by fear of terrorism and support for commercial real estate developers and insurance companies, mostly favored extending TRIA, it failed to get through the Senate. That\u2019s partly due to unrelated policy changes attached to the bill, and partly because \u2013 get this \u2013 Congress wanted to go home early for the holidays.</p> <p>This means that on 31 December, TRIA will expire. </p> <p>Good riddance.</p> <p>TRIA was sold as a temporary program and not a permanent bailout guarantee for a wealthy industry with lots of clout in Washington. For the most part, only conservatives opposed to \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d have raised questions about TRIA. But everyone should question the need for giant subsidies that the insurance industry doesn\u2019t even have to pay for.</p> <p>Unfortunately, both the insurance industry and big businesses, who pay lower premiums because of the bailout guarantee, support TRIA. And you can be sure they will flood the new Congress with lobbyists to demand a restoration of the program.</p> <p>Big developers and insurers have freaked out over losing this cushion, warning even of a <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-12-09/the-terrorism-risk-insurance-act-is-vital-to-the-super-bowl?wpisrc=nl-wonkbk&amp;wpmm=1\">cancellation of the Super Bowl</a>, but we may soon find that life can go on without the government guaranteeing a market for a large, profitable business sector. <br></p> <p>Maybe some good old-fashioned American innovation will ensure that TRIA, initially sold as a temporary program, stays expired.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da6f8a85037e0e3adc2ab2ac04bff453dc25f67f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/22/1419262954430/9b7184d8-6cdd-441d-9e0f-2aea5a7df48a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"AIG\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The CEO of AIG, Edward Liddy, looks back at protesters from the group Code Pink as he arrives to testify before the House in Washington DC in 2009.

Under the program, insurers must offer terrorism policies for commercial developments like skyscrapers and arenas, but they don\u2019t have to pay damages above a certain threshold. The government can then recoup those costs later with a 3% surcharge on annual premiums.</p> <p>In the 12 years since its inception in 2002, insurers have made roughly $40bn from government-guaranteed terrorism insurance, without having to pay a dime on any claim or give the government anything in exchange for that backstop. </p> <p>Before the final machinations, it looked like TRIA would be fast-tracked for extension, as it has been twice before. The <a href=\"http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Newsroom.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=d759e623-ca6c-f90e-483f-4cd485db8404\">House</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kirk.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=1051\">Senate</a> crafted bipartisan coalitions to extend TRIA, and this month the House financial services committee chairman, Jeb Hensarling of Texas, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York came together in principle on compromise legislation.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/hensarling-schumer-near-deal-on-terrorism-insurance-20141204\">deal</a> would have maintained the program for six more years and would have raised the threshold for the government to begin paying out terrorism insurance claims from $100m to $200m. Fiscally conservative Republicans like Hensarling had sought a threshold as high as $500m, to reduce government\u2019s exposure to claims. But he accepted the compromise.</p> <p>Negotiators were all set to stick the TRIA extension into the must-pass CRomnibus budget bill.

      "bodyText": "In its final week, the 113th US Congress managed to pass a spending bill loaded with policy giveaways to special interests, and a year-long extension of mostly corporate tax breaks. But they couldn\u2019t finish off the lobbyist Triple Crown. There was one task Congress couldn\u2019t tackle: approve an extension of the Terrorist Risk Insurance Act, known as TRIA. The bill provides lucrative government bailout protection for the insurance industry in case of a terrorist attack like 9/11 or, as Hollywood has feared, retribution for American entertainment choices by North Korea. Although both Democrats and Republicans, motivated by fear of terrorism and support for commercial real estate developers and insurance companies, mostly favored extending TRIA, it failed to get through the Senate. That\u2019s partly due to unrelated policy changes attached to the bill, and partly because \u2013 get this \u2013 Congress wanted to go home early for the holidays. This means that on 31 December, TRIA will expire. Good riddance. TRIA was sold as a temporary program and not a permanent bailout guarantee for a wealthy industry with lots of clout in Washington. For the most part, only conservatives opposed to \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d have raised questions about TRIA. But everyone should question the need for giant subsidies that the insurance industry doesn\u2019t even have to pay for. Unfortunately, both the insurance industry and big businesses, who pay lower premiums because of the bailout guarantee, support TRIA. And you can be sure they will flood the new Congress with lobbyists to demand a restoration of the program. Big developers and insurers have freaked out over losing this cushion, warning even of a cancellation of the Super Bowl, but we may soon find that life can go on without the government guaranteeing a market for a large, profitable business sector. Maybe some good old-fashioned American innovation will ensure that TRIA, initially sold as a temporary program, stays expired. I explained TRIA for the Guardian back in June. Under the program, insurers must offer terrorism policies for commercial developments like skyscrapers and arenas, but they don\u2019t have to pay damages above a certain threshold. The government can then recoup those costs later with a 3% surcharge on annual premiums. In the 12 years since its inception in 2002, insurers have made roughly $40bn from government-guaranteed terrorism insurance, without having to pay a dime on any claim or give the government anything in exchange for that backstop. Before the final machinations, it looked like TRIA would be fast-tracked for extension, as it has been twice before. The House and Senate crafted bipartisan coalitions to extend TRIA, and this month the House financial services committee chairman, Jeb Hensarling of Texas, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York came together in principle on compromise legislation. The deal would have maintained the program for six more years and would have raised the threshold for the government to begin paying out terrorism insurance claims from $100m to $200m. Fiscally conservative Republicans like Hensarling had sought a threshold as high as $500m, to reduce government\u2019s exposure to claims. But he accepted the compromise. Negotiators were all set to stick the TRIA extension into the must-pass CRomnibus budget bill. But Hensarling decided to attach to TRIA another rollback of the Dodd-Frank law, which would relieve non-financial companies of having to follow the same rules as banks on the derivatives they purchase, including the posting of collateral for every trade. Hensarling described this as a technical change and pointed out how Democrats once supported it. But Schumer blasted the inclusion of an unrelated policy rider \u2013 not unlike those that filled the CRomnibus. The House passed the Hensarling version of TRIA with the Dodd-Frank change before it left town, dropping extension in the Senate\u2019s lap. Despite Senate Democrats\u2019 insistence that they would not put Hensarling\u2019s version up for a vote, the majority leader, Harry Reid, did try to quickly pass the bill on 17 December. But outgoing Republican senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma objected to unanimous consent to advance the bill in opposition to an entirely different provision which maintained a national insurance agent licensing board. Instead of fighting, Reid decided to drop the bill, and wrapped up the congressional session for the year. Coburn could not kill TRIA by himself. His objection merely meant that the Senate would have had to go through the time-consuming process of cloture votes to break filibusters, as they do on other legislation. The House version of TRIA passed the chamber 417-7; it\u2019s highly likely that 60 votes were available to pass it in the Senate. So Coburn didn\u2019t really stop TRIA \u2013 Democrats chose not to pursue it: because they were peeved about the Dodd-Frank rider, because it would take too much time, and because everyone really wanted to get back home for the holidays. If a terrorism insurance backstop were of such monumental importance to the country, one would think the Senate would delay its vacation a few days. At the time Reid said: \u201cSenator McConnell can bring TRIA up on the first day of the new Senate, and I hope he will since there is no time to waste.\u201d But perhaps a better solution would be to see how the insurance industry adapts to losing the government guarantee. For example, reinsurers \u2013 the companies that insure insurance companies \u2013 could actually try to model the risk of a terrorist attack, as they said they would in 2002, and price terrorism coverage accordingly. Or states could band together to create risk pools that would kick in to handle the issue. Or the program could be taken out of the hands of the industry and made completely public, with the federal government taking in premiums and paying out claims themselves, eliminating the middleman.

Thomas Bisacquino of the Commercial Real Estate Development Association said in a statement on Wednesday: \u201cWe hope the President and the new Congress will make renewal of TRIA the first order of business when they return in January.\u201d But perhaps the expiration of TRIA can shed some light on its necessity.

      "bodyText": "Inequality was one of the big issues in 2014 and this is reflected in two of our top 10 most read stories. Consumer issues featured heavily, from air rage over reclining seats to Black Friday and Boxing Day bargains. And our special investigation into the tiny state that rubber-stamped tax evasion of an industrial scale also made it into the top 10. Based on the number of visits to each page, here\u2019s the full list of the most popular stories from theguardian.com/uk/business last year. 1. The windowless plane set for take-off in a decade The vision of a windowless plane that would still would allow passengers to see what\u2019s going on outside, as well as checking their email and surfing the net, really captured readers\u2019 imagination. In a glimpse of what the next generation of commercial aircraft might look like, windows would be replaced by full-length screens allowing constant views of the world outside. Passengers would be able to switch the view on and off according to their preference, identify prominent sights by tapping the screen or even just surf the internet. 2. Black Friday in Britain: where are the best deals? Shoppers were out in force at the end of November, as more and more British retailers adopted the US tradition of Black Friday discounts to kick-start the festive spending splurge. There were scuffles, police were called and shoppers bough things they didn\u2019t really want or need. 3. Tesco\u2019s \u2018penis\u2019-themed buttermilk and other design fails Sometimes designers fail to see the big picture when dreaming up logos or product packaging. But, once you see the design fail, especially the risque ones, it\u2019s pretty obvious really. 4. Oxfam: 85 richest people as wealthy as poorest half of the world The extent to which so much global wealth has become corralled by a virtual handful of the so-called \u201cglobal elite\u201d was exposed in a new report from Oxfam. The world\u2019s wealthiest people aren\u2019t known for travelling by bus, but the 85 who control as much wealth as the poorest half of the population could squeeze onto a single doubledecker. 5. Britain\u2019s five richest families worth more than poorest 20% The scale of Britain\u2019s growing inequality was laid bare in another Oxfam report, A Tale of Two Britains: Inequality in the UK, which showed that the country\u2019s five richest families now own more wealth than the poorest 20% of the population. Oxfam said the poorest 20% in the UK had wealth totalling \u00a328.1bn \u2013 an average of \u00a32,230 each. That was equivalent to the five top UK entries on the Forbes rich list, who were worth \u00a328.2bn in total. 6. Plane diverted as passengers fight over seat reclining The Knee Defender, a controversial $21.95 device that prevents the seat in front from reclining, caused a fight among passengers on United Airlines flight 1462, forcing the plan to divert so the two passengers could be removed. The male passenger, seated in a middle seat of row 12, used the device to stop the woman in front of him reclining while he was on his laptop. 7. Boxing Day sales start early: where are the best deals? Boxing Day remains an important date in the retail calendar but the sales started early this year and Christmas Eve and Christmas Day were big online shopping days. 8. Sainsbury\u2019s puts poster in window that customers were never meant to see A motivational poster asking staff to make customers spend 50p more was mistakenly displayed in a Sainsbury\u2019s store window. The blunder was taken up by Twitter, guaranteeing it an audience far wider than the Sainsbury\u2019s staff room. 9. Vodafone reveals existence of secret wires that allow state surveillance One of the world\u2019s largest mobile phone groups revealed the existence of secret wires that allow government agencies to listen to all conversations on its networks, saying they are widely used in some of the 29 countries in which it operates in Europe and beyond. It broke its silence on in order to push back against the increasingly widespread use of phone and broadband networks to spy on citizens. 10. Luxembourg tax files: how tiny state rubber-stamped tax avoidance on an industrial scale An unprecedented international investigation into tax deals struck with Luxembourg uncovered the multibillion-dollar tax secrets of some of the world\u2019s largest multinational corporations. A cache of almost 28,000 pages of leaked tax agreements, returns and other sensitive papers relating to over 1,000 businesses painted a damning picture of an EU state which is quietly rubber-stamping tax avoidance on an industrial scale.",

If the parliamentary decision goes against prime minister Antonis Samaras, then snap elections are set to be called, which could see the anti-austerity party Syriza come to power, an event which would send shockwaves through the eurozone. So despite US markets hitting yet new highs on Boxing Day, European markets are nervous. However the FTSE 100 is currently 11.22 points higher at 6621.15, outperforming its peers elsewhere. With gold and silver stable, Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo is up 25p at 755p while Randgold Resources has risen 114p to \u00a342.67. Even though there are concerns about China, a key consumer of commodities, as a government think tank forecast a slowdown in the economy from 7.3% this year to 7% in 2015, mining shares have shrugged this aside. BHP Billiton is 39p better at \u00a314.08 and Rio Tinto is up 64p to 2951.5p. Elsewhere BG is 7.4p better at 888.6p as the gases group said it was preparing to deliver its first commecial liquefied natural gas cargo to China from its new Queenland Curtis project. It was a day for companies going ex-dividend, with Burberry down 17p to \u00a316.38 and BT 6.5p lower at 410.2p. Lower down the market Victoria Oil and Gas has jumped nearly 14% to 56.75p after it signed an agreement to supply gas to two power stations in Cameroon.

The governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, would like to see the dollar below US$0.75. To get there, another interest rate cut may be necessary.
