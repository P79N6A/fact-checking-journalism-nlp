      "bodyText": "With its replacement bus services, eccentric time keeping, byzantine fare structures and frequent overcrowding, the British rail system seems an unlikely export. But National Express has won the tender for two routes in Germany, whose state-dominated rail network has long enjoyed a reputation for comfort and sophistication in comparison to Britain's fractured and often criticised privatised system. The British firm, which operates the London-Southend c2c route, has secured two contracts in Germany's most populous region, North Rhine-Westphalia, for the Rheine-M\u00fcnster-Cologne-Krefeld and Bonn-Cologne-Wuppertal services. Mainland European markets are usually closed to external operators and largely the domain of state-owned companies such as the powerful Deutsche Bahn. This has in turn allowed the likes of DB to enter the UK market, acquiring Arriva, the owner of the Arriva Train Wales and CrossCountry franchises. The German rail market is the largest in Europe, nearly twice as big as the UK franchising system. The National Express contracts, worth a combined \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.4bn), are the first \"competitive\" entry into the German market by a UK player. Arriva had acquired a small German rail contract before being bought by DB. The Cologne contracts cover a slightly smaller distance than c2c and about half the number of passengers, at 18 million a year. The move marks another step in the recovery in fortunes for the rail arm of National Express, which was stripped of the British East Coast mainline in 2009. The company, which also has transport services in North America, Spain and Morocco, is in the running for three other franchises in Germany and is applying for licences to operate coach services in that country. Dean Finch, National Express chief executive, said: \"National Express is delighted to have been selected to run these two German commuter rail contracts. I'm particularly pleased that our success in running the UK's best performing franchise has been recognised by the German authorities. We look forward to maintaining these high standards and serving the people of North Rhine-Westphalia for many years to come.\" Last week National Express criticised the government for refusing to reimburse it and three other rail operators estimated to have spent a combined \u00a340m competing for the scrapped Great Western services between London, Bristol and Cardiff. A report published early last year found that Britain's railways were the worst in Europe for affordability, efficiency and speed. The British network lags behind countries including France, Germany, Spain and Italy, according to the RMT-commissioned report by the thinktank Just Economics.",

      "bodyText": "The US's top transportation safety investigator has questioned the \"assumptions\" regulators used before clearing Boeing's use of controversial lithium-ion batteries on its grounded 787 Dreamliner. The national transportation safety board (NTSB) has been investigating the battery of a Japan Airlines 787 that caught fire at Boston's Logan airport in January. NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman told reporters on Thursday that tests showed a failure in a single cell of the battery spread to the rest of the battery in a way unanticipated by Boeing. Before the Dreamliner's approval for flight the company had discounted such an event, Hersman said. The Japan Airlines battery fire and a battery alarm that led to an emergency landing for an All Nippon Airlines 787 days later led to the grounding of Boeing's hi-tech model. Boeing had calculated that the lithium-ion batteries would produce smoke less than once in 10m flight hours, Hersman said. \"The 787 fleet has accumulated less than 100,000 flight hours yet there have been two battery events resulting in smoke less than two weeks apart and on two different aircraft,\" she said. \"Assumptions used to certify the battery must be reconsidered.\" She said those assumptions \"were not met\". The fire in the Japan Airlines battery started with multiple short-circuits in one of the battery's eight cells, said Hersman. The short-circuits led to an uncontrolled chemical reaction, known as \"thermal runaway\", that spread to the rest of the cells. The fire started when the sixth of the eight cells failed. Boeing was required to perform special tests to certify the lithium-ion batteries for the 787. These types of batteries have caught fire in many other situations including in cell phones, cars and light aircraft. The FAA has strict guidelines for passengers carrying lithium-ion batteries as cargo because of fire concerns. The 787 is the first large passenger plane to use them so extensively. Boeing's certification tests had shown no evidence of internal battery failures spreading from cell to cell, Hersman said. The root cause of the fire had yet to be identified. The NTSB is checking whether contamination or internal battery defects led to the fire. A report of the safety watchdog's findings is expected in 30 days. Having identified one issue, Hersman said, the NTSB would now examine the battery's design, how the unit's eight cells are linked, how it was charged and how it was manufactured. Ultimately, she said, the FAA and not the NTSB would determine when the Dreamliner were allowed to fly again. But any hope of a swift resolution appears to have gone. Boeing has orders for about 800 787s and is developing a new version. All 50 planes that have been delivered have been grounded and those on order have been put on hold until the battery issue is fixed. The grounding is likely to lead to a vigorous examination of lithium-ion batteries in passenger planes. The Airbus A350, expected to be ready next year, uses them as well.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Parlophone, the historic British record label behind Coldplay, Blur and Kylie Minogue, is to become part of Warner Music in an estimated \u00a3487m deal. Warner's owner, Len Blavatnik, has beaten rival bids from Simon Fuller, founder of the American Idol TV series, who teamed up with Island Records' founder Chris Blackwell, and an alliance between Sony and BMG. As the label that signed the Beatles, Parlophone was the jewel in the crown of UK major EMI. It was put up for sale on the orders of the European commission, as a condition of the \u00a31.2bn acquisition of EMI by Universal Music. The deal is a victory for Blavatnik, the billionaire part-owner of the Russian oil conglomerate TNK-BP, who had been involved in past attempts to merge Warner with EMI. Having outbid Roman Abramovich on a \u00a341m house in Kensington Palace Gardens in 2004, Blavatnik is known for his deep pockets and is paying cash for Parlophone, which is also home to Pink Floyd. \"This is a very important milestone for Warner Music, reflecting our commitment to artist development by strengthening our worldwide roster, global footprint and executive talent,\" said Blavatnik. As part of the deal, Warner is also acquiring the Chrysalis and Ensign labels, as well as EMI's recorded music operations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia and Sweden. A US citizen who describes himself as an industrialist and philanthropist and dislikes the term oligarch, Blavatnik has been on the board of Warner since 2004, when it was controlled by his friend Edgar Bronfman Jr. The Ukrainian-born businessman was thwarted in a first attempt to buy EMI in 2007 by Guy Hands, whose Terra Firma took control in one of the most catastrophic private-equity buyouts of the credit boom. Unable to cope with its mountain of debt, EMI was seized by its bank, Citi, and put under the hammer in 2011. Blavatnik bid again, hoping to merge EMI with Warner, which had just come under his control in a $3.3bn (\u00a32.1bn) cash deal, but lost out to Universal. With Parlophone, his persistence has paid off. Universal will now have to submit a purchaser-approval request to the European commission. It is understood Warner's offer includes a guarantee to cover any regulatory costs should the sale become tied up in red tape. \"The commission's policy is to verify that the divestiture to any purchaser does not raise new competition concerns,\" said a spokesman for the EU competition chief, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia. Some argue that the deal could be controversial in Brussels, with just three companies \u2013 Warner, Universal and Sony \u2013 now dominating the music industry. BMG is also a player, but often works in collaboration with Sony. \"Warner have basically thrown an unrealistic amount of money at this in order to grow market share,\" said an industry insider. \"I think it will be challenged by the European commission because they are lessening competition.\" Music majors have been driven to merge by falling profits, with sales flattened by the rise of music piracy and digital downloading. The deal will add scale to Warner, whose stable includes Led Zeppelin, Metallica and Bruno Mars but is smaller than Sony and Universal and has been seeking a marriage with EMI since 2000. \"This is the best result for the market,\" said Martin Mills, who runs the Beggars Group independent label and was one of the most vocal opponents of Universal's acquisition of EMI. \"Warner is a great record company and they are going to be a good home for those artists. It will create a more healthy market than if Universal had swallowed EMI whole or if Sony had bought them. Parlophone is the oldest active label at EMI and one of its most prestigious. It began life as Britain's leading jazz label before becoming part of Columbia Records, which was in turn swallowed by EMI. When the producer and composer Sir George Martin took over as manager in 1955, he began with comedy recordings by the Goons and Peter Sellers. The breakthrough came in 1962, when Martin, now known as the Fifth Beatle, signed a Liverpool band who were to become the world's most commercially successful musicians. The Beatles catalogue, however, is not part of the Parlophone deal.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is expected to move more decisively this summer to boost lending, after its incoming boss Mark Carney hinted that he is in favour of more aggressive action to boost growth. Carney, who arrives in June from Canada after being headhunted by George Osborne, told MPs he will consider expanding the tools available to the central bank in its efforts to spur lending to households and small businesses. Appearing before the Treasury select committee, Carney, currently governor of the Bank of Canada, denied he would be an \"emperor\" and played down his film star reputation within the financial community, saying he planned to spend his first six months in the job building a \"consensual institution\" and getting to grips with the Bank's new regulatory powers. Osborne rejected the cream of British financial regulators in favour of the 47-year-old Canadian, offering him a salary of \u00a3874,000, including a \u00a35,000-a-week housing allowance. While young by central banker standards, Carney has already assumed the role as head of the Financial Stability Board, the international body handed the job of preventing a repetition of the 2008 financial crash. Osborne is keen for Carney to make a strong start after his relationship with outgoing governor, Sir Mervyn King, soured. King publicly supported plans to prioritise public spending cuts and pay down UK debts, but has recently frustrated Treasury calls for stronger action, principally printing money to expand lending to households and small businesses. Carney said the Canadian central bank reviewed its practices every five years, which he found very useful. \"The flexible inflation-targeting framework should remain broadly in place, but details need to be reviewed and could be changed,\" he told MPs. Carney, appearing in a parliamentary confirmation hearing, said he favoured a policy adopted in Canada and more recently by the US central bank that involved making a commitment to keep interest rates low for a fixed period or until an agreed target is reached, giving borrowers considerable breathing space before rates increase. But he played down suggestions that he might favour dramatic changes in policy, for instance replacing the bank's inflation target with a target that focused purely on achieving a rise in GDP. \"In my view, flexible inflation targeting \u2013 as practised in both Canada and the UK \u2013 has proven itself to be the most effective monetary policy framework implemented thus far,\" he said. Carney rebutted criticism that his pay package was overly generous, saying it merely maintained his Canadian standard of living in an expensive city like London and was similar to the pay awarded to the outgoing boss of the main City regulator. His pay package was questioned by Labour MP Teresa Pearce, who said it was almost three times the \u00a3305,000 paid to current governor Sir Mervyn King. Andrew Tyrie, the Tory chairman of the committee, contrasted Carney's huge pay rise on taking his new job with a two-year pay freeze for the Bank's staff. But Carney, who stressed he was not taking a pension, which was worth around \u00a3300,000 in final salary contributions to King, was buoyed by support from Tory MP David Ruffley, who said: \"On the question of pay, you will be paid considerably less than recent England football managers and I think you are likely to have more success than them.\" The monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates and will be chaired by Carney, said on Thursday that it would keep base rates at 0.5% and maintain the level of quantitative easing at \u00a3375bn. In a note, the MPC made it clear that the UK economy was still weak despite a bounce back in some areas over the last month and rising inflation. Inflation \u2013 already at 2.7% \u2013 was likely to rise further in the coming months and may remain above 2% for the next two years before falling back, it said. The message surprised many in the City, who are concerned that inflation has already remained stubbornly high for several years. The Bank blamed energy bill hikes and increases in university tuition fees. It also said a batch of positive economic figures, including a strong recovery in industrial production, could prove temporary and fizzle out. Most economic forecasters predict unemployment will continue to rise over the coming months and only fall back again in 2015. Carney was asked by MPs if he was concerned by unemployment and the lack of business investment, which has stifled the recovery. He said the central bank should focus on fighting inflation, but with sufficient flexibility that it continues to support economic growth until it reaches \"escape velocity\". He insisted more could be done under the current framework, which he called \"flexible inflation targeting\", to stimulate the moribund economy, including offering so-called \"guidance\" to reassure investors that the monetary policy committee would not tighten policy until the economy has fully recovered. The Federal Reserve has promised that it will continue with the emergency policy of quantitative easing, until the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.5% or below.",

There is a real danger that the solution to the financial problem creates a really profound political problem.</p> <p>Germany needs to realise that the policy it imposes on the euro area - the austerity programme - is counter-productive. It cannot actually succeed. At the moment they [the south] is being pushed - unwittingly, not with bad intentions, but the effect is that they are being pushed into a long lasting depression and that is what is happening to Europe. And it may last more than a decade, in fact it could become permanent, until the pain is so big that eventually there may be a rebellion, a rejection of the EU, and that would then be the destruction of the EU, which is a terribly heavy price to maintain to preserve the euro, which is meant to be just a servant of the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is the Soviet Union quote. Asked whether the euro would survive, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It could last quite a long time, the same way as the Soviet Union, which was a very bad arrangement, lasted for 70 years. However, I think that eventually, it is bound to break up the European Union. The longer it will take, and&#xa0;it may take generations, those will be lost in terms of political freedom and economic prosperity. The solution is to me a terrible tragedy for the EU. And it's happening to the most developed open society in the world. To me it's a terrible tragedy.

And both were bailed out.</p> <p>Opening up the market to new competition means that barriers to entry - essentially getting authorisation from the Prudential Regulation Authority - need to be eased and that some banks will need to fail.</p> <p>\"With a deposit guarantee scheme and a resolution regime in place, banks, particularly smaller ones, will be able to fail without threatening the stability of the banking system as a whole. It follows that the prudential requirements on new entrants can, and should, be lighter than they have been in the past, although some minimum standards must of course be maintained.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"The PRA is therefore reforming its authorisation requirements for banks in ways that reduce barriers to entry.

My colleague Henry McDonald reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Liquidating the Anglo Irish Bank can only improve Ireland's economic situation, the former deputy chief of the International Monetary Fund said this morning.</p> <p>Last night both houses of the Irish Parliament rushed through legislation to close down the now nationalised bank that almost bankrupted the Republic.</p> <p>It meant that Ireland will avoid having to pay a punitive IOU to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders of more than \u20ac3bn at the end of next month. That debt will now be spread over into a long term government bond.</p> <p>Speaking on RTE's Morning Ireland, former IMF deputy director Donal Donovan said it would reduce the amount the government had to find every year to pay back the the debt.</p> <p>\"By reducing the \u20ac3.1bn principal repayment, pushing it out, we are doing two things: first of all we're reducing the amount the government has to find every year to borrow from the markets in order to come up with this \u20ac3.1bn - it's not going to be zero, but it'll be likely to be much less,\" Mr Donovan said.</p> <p>\"Second, by pushing it out, we are giving the opportunity for the country to grow and for recovery to take place, so that when we do start to repay this down the road, the cost is not going to be so great. That's not a trivial thing.\"</p> <p>The move requires approval from the European Central Bank, which may be endorsed in Frankfurt later today.</p> <p>The historic Anglo Irish Bank debt had been costing Irish taxpayers \u20ac3.1bn each year.</p> <p>Although 800 jobs are at risk as a result of liquidating Anglo which was renamed under state control the IBRC Irish government sources said many of these posts could be saved by re-directing towards the National Assets Management Agency - the body which is in charge of toxic, debt ridden assets banks owned and later had to hand over to the Irish state.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7540647f-23ed-4b8c-905c-64f92b66b88a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/7/1360230483793/24e7250e-cc73-4a27-9b8a-c13f3b3f4ee1-460.jpeg\" alt=\"The Irish government plans to introduce legislation to liquidate the Anglo Irish Bank.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Irish government plans to introduce legislation to liquidate the Anglo Irish Bank.

But, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324445904578282010522792582.html?mod=rss_about_uk\">Simon Nixon argues in the Wall Street Journal</a>, that \"some of the Carney gloss is coming off\". He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is fair to say that in the two months since his appointment, some of the gloss has come off Mr. Carney's reputation\u2014and that some of this damage is self-inflicted.</p> </blockquote> <p data-ls-seen=\"1\">First, he notes that<strong> Carney's decision to seek a pay package worth more than \u00a31m, will make his job harder</strong> as it risks reinforcing the perception that he is a globe-trotting hired gun with no deep commitment to the UK. That will only inflame hostility towards him if and when the central bank is forced to take unpopular decisions.</p> <p data-ls-seen=\"1\">But, writes Nixon, t<strong>he governor-elect has also made his life more difficult by questioning the Bank of England's prized inflation target.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The more puzzling self-inflicted wound was Mr. Carney's decision to float the idea that the BOE might drop its inflation target in favor of a nominal GDP target. This piece of kite-flying, which appears to have been coordinated with the Treasury, has been almost universally dismissed by market economists and fellow central bankers.</p> <p>Adam Posen, a former U.K. rate-setter with a reputation as a \"dove\" who consistently played down inflation concerns and favored greater central-bank stimulus, told Parliament last month that abandoning the inflation target would be a \"grievous error\" that would raise unnecessary concerns over the U.K.'s commitment to sound money. Another former U.K. rate-setter and arch-dove, David Blanchflower, has pointed out that even if nominal-GDP targeting was a good idea in theory, it is a bad idea in practice because nominal GDP is hard to measure and prone to large revisions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-07T09:51:20.399Z\">at 9.51am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51137119b5790c5937938b11\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-07T09:17:13.419Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Merkel in Paris ahead of budget talks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to the EU budget talks, which will be discussed late into the night tonight, with no decision expected until tomorrow morning at the very earliest.&#xa0;</p> <p>It seems German Chancellor Angela Merkel was preparing the ground last night, with a trip to Paris where she tried to strike a deal with French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande ahead of the talks (while taking in the football).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-38eeb604-778e-4071-b940-cdfd4d0ddc2b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/7/1360228006289/0996e596-d500-46ae-9cd8-5241cf19c257-460.jpeg\" alt=\"German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande attend the international friendly soccer match between France and Germany at the Stade de France in Paris last night.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande attend the international friendly football match between France and Germany at the Stade de France in Paris last night.

      "bodyText": "The various whisperings about a budget figure continue to do the rounds ahead of the delayed ministers meeting. And as the summit looks set for another long night, we've shutting up shop here. Back in the morning to read the runes of the discussions and decisions (if any). Thanks for all your comments, and see you all tomorrow. More delays to the start of the EU summit: And here's one of those side meetings: Here's some commentary from Capital Economics on the fall in the euro, down around 1% on the day against the dollar: The euro fell sharply against the dollar on Thursday as ECB President Draghi acknowledged the dampening influence that the recent strength of Europe\u2019s single currency might have on euro-zone inflation and warned that the policies of central banks in other countries would \u201chave to be discussed\u201d if they resulted in the currencies of those countries falling to levels that were not warranted by economic fundamentals. Nonetheless, we would not read too much into these statements, which were possibly partly aimed at placating those calling for the ECB to do more to prevent the euro from appreciating. With the euro falling on the comments from ECB president Mario Draghi about continuing economic weakness in the eurozone, stock markets are - in the main - on a downward trend. Bank of England governor-elect Mark Carney did not help sentiment by suggesting stimulus measures would continue to be needed in the UK. So, with the US market tumbling too after some mixed January sales numbers from a number of retailers, here's the final scores for Europe: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 66.92 points lower at 6228.42, down 1.06% \u2022 Germany's Dax bucked the trend, up 0.13% \u2022 France's Cac closed down 1.15% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB finished 1.22% lower \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended down 0.52% \u2022 But Athens added 0.67% In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 126 points lower or 0.9%. So what are the chances of a budget agreement? One former colleague says: Still with Ireland: the longer term government bonds which replace the Promissory Notes will have maturities of up to 40 years. Premier Kenny said: The first principal payment will not now be made until 2038 and the last payment will be made in 2053. The average maturity of the Government bonds will be over 34 years as opposed to the 7 to 8 year average maturity on the Promissory Notes. The Irish Times has Kenny's full statement here. Despite Mario Draghi's stonewalling, it looks like Ireland has its deal with the European Central Bank. Henry McDonald in Dublin writes: Ireland's premier Enda Kenny has confirmed that the Republic has secured a deal with the ECB to ease the country's \u20ac28bn debt from the now liquidated Anglo Irish Bank. The Republic will now not have to pay more than \u20ac3bn this March to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders. Instead the IOUs or Promissory Notes will be replaced by a longer term government bond. Kenny told the Dail: \u201cToday's outcome is a historic step on the road to economic recovery.\u201d His deputy prime minister/Tanaister Eamon Gilmore added: \u201cWe have wiped Anglo Irish Bank off the map\u201d and that the deal supported by the ECB has \u201ctorn up the Promissory Note.\u201d The leader of the main opposition party, Fianna Fail's Micheal Martin, accepted that today's deal would enable Ireland to exit the IMF, ECB, EU bailout programme and help restore the country's economic sovereignty. Earlier today the president of the ECB Mario Draghi gave a heavy hint in Frankfurt that the Europe was backing the deal that significantly lowers Dublin's debt on the busted bank. Draghi: \u201cWe took note of an action that is being undertaken by the Irish Government.\u201d Officials in Dublin and Frankfurt said that his term \u201ctake note\u201d could be translated as backing for Ireland. Anglo Irish Bank was the bank that almost bankrupted Ireland given its reckless lending of billions of euros to speculators including Ireland's one time richest man Sean Quinn to play the global property market. More comments from leaders as they arrive for the EU summit: However the start time of the gathering has been put back to 17.30, a two hour delay (seems to be a day for them with both Mark Carney and Mario Draghi late for their respective meetings). Here are the new timings and here the original plans. Meanwhile, the EU leaders are arriving for the summit, where they will discuss the trillion-euro budget. But, while Draghi remained tight-lipped on Ireland, we should get some detail from Taoiseach Enda Kenny when he address the Dail before 3pm to outline the deal the Coalition has secured from Europe on Ireland's bank debt. Henry McDonald reports: At present the cost of Anglo Irish Bank's debts is around \u20ac28 billion to the Irish taxpayer. One source in Dublin has said there will be \"no road blocks\" from the European Central Bank to prevent the liquidation of the Anglo Irish Bank now renamed the IBRC. This coming deal is the one Kenny and his government have staked their reputation in terms of managing the Irish economy out of crisis. So what have the markets made of noises coming out of both the Bank of England and the ECB? UK shares fell after incoming bank governor Mark Carney dashed hopes that he would ease monetary policy when he takes charge. But European shares are higher, as Draghi signals the ECB will maintain its accomodative policy. UK FTSE 100: down 0.34% France CAC 40: up 0.13% Germany DAX: up 0.91% Spain IBEX: up 1% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.94% Draghi finishes by batting away yet another question about Ireland. He says the efforts of the Irish government on the financial policy front was what was important to re-establish the credibility of Ireland in the international markets. Someone helpfully reminds Draghi not to forget his glasses as he heads out of the room for another month. Draghi says Bundesbank chief Weidmann is absolutely right about being worried about central bank independence, it is a compliment to credibility. Draghi says the decision not to change interest rates was unanimous. Of course there were hints and discussions on how to improve financial conditions but that's it. More Draghi... he says the ECB is convinced its policies are compatible with price stability and job creation. We foresee a gradual recovery in the second part of this year. Weak demand could explain subdued credit levels. We continue trying everything we can to resume credit flows. Now he's talking about the single supervisory mechanism for EU banks. We can't afford separate banking regulation, we need to converge on one rule for the euro area, maybe the EU. The legal act on the SSM has not been approved yet. The consultation with the EU parliament is still in progress. He says there is a lot of support for the SSM. He is also defending his role as head of Italy's central bank in the supervision Banca Monte deiPaschi di Siena. He says he does not want to take sides in the upcoming Italian elections but... You should discount much of what you hear and read as part of the noise elections produce. Draghi is asked yet again about the Irish promissory note swap. We do not want to enter into details of the swap. He says, acknowledging, at least that there is some kind of swap. Mark Carney, the Canadian head-hunted by George Osborne to run the Bank of England, has told MPs he expects to undertake a thorough review of the UK's economic policy regime when he arrives at Threadneedle Street in July, writes Heather Stewart. Appearing before the cross-party Treasury select committee, Carney, who is currently the governor of the Bank of Canada, praised the process of five-yearly reviews of how inflation-targeting works in Canada \u2014 and conceded that he had discussed with the chancellor the possibility of altering the framework. \"The flexible inflation-targeting framework should remain broadly in place, but details need to be reviewed and could be changed,\" he told MPs. In more than 40 pages of written evidence submitted to the committee, he characterised his conclusion on whether to ditch the current framework as: \"the bar for change is very high but review and debate can be positive\". Carney appeared to back away from one idea he mooted in a speech in December - that the current inflation target could be replaced by a so-called \"nominal GDP\" target, which could force the Bank to do more to kick-start growth. But he insisted to MPs that more could be done under the current framework, which he called \"flexible inflation targeting\", to stimulate the moribund economy, including offering so-called \"guidance\" to reassure investors that the monetary policy committee would not tighten policy until the economy has fully recovered. The Federal Reserve has promised that it will continue with the emergency policy of quantitative easing, until the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.5% of below. Draghi has batted away questions about the liquidation Anglo Irish Bank, referring everyone back to the Irish government. Reuters sources are saying his comments signal ECB approval of the move. In answer to a question about when the recovery would take place, Draghi - seemingly amused - said it was too hard to answer exactly what time that would happen. On the euro, he was asked about the recent rise in the single currency, and whether that posed a risk to stability. He said the appreciation reflected growing signs of the return of confidence in the euro. By and large, he said, the nominal and real exchange rate was at or about the long term average. He did say the bank would continue to closely monitor market developments. There have been growing concerns that the strength of the euro could jeopardise any recovery. Meanwhile we are getting some early comments ahead of the EU summit. German chancellor Angela Merkel is quoted as saying the positions on the EU budget are still quite far apart and it is not possible to say whether there will be an agreement. European inflation was 2% in January, down from 2.2% in November and December, and should fall below 2% in the coming months, says Draghi. Draghi says economic weakness in the euro area will continue in the early part of the year but later in 2013 economic activity should start to recover. This will be helped by better external demand, easier financial market conditions and monetary policy. There is a stabilisation of business and consumer confidence. He emphasises several times the ECB's \"accomodative\" monetary policy stance. Draghi has now started and the press conference can be followed here. Anything Mark Carney can do, Mario Draghi can do too. He is late for the ECB's press conference. Meanwhile in the US, weekly jobless claims came in at 366,000, down on the previous week's revised 371,000 and with the trend figure near a five year low. Analysts had been expecting a slightly larger fall, to around 360,000 Carney is asked about banks shrinking their balance sheets, and the negative effect that has on their lending to small businesses. He says there are other ways of shrinking the balance sheet, such as through higher retained earnings or shrinking balance sheets outside the UK. Back with the euro, and financier George Soros has said in an interview there was a real danger it could break up the European Union. Open Europe has the detail here but among other things, the man credited with making billions out of betting against the pound, compared the single currency to the Soviet Union. He said: I am terribly concerned about the euro potentially destroying the EU. There is a real danger that the solution to the financial problem creates a really profound political problem. Germany needs to realise that the policy it imposes on the euro area - the austerity programme - is counter-productive. It cannot actually succeed. At the moment they [the south] is being pushed - unwittingly, not with bad intentions, but the effect is that they are being pushed into a long lasting depression and that is what is happening to Europe. And it may last more than a decade, in fact it could become permanent, until the pain is so big that eventually there may be a rebellion, a rejection of the EU, and that would then be the destruction of the EU, which is a terribly heavy price to maintain to preserve the euro, which is meant to be just a servant of the EU. And here is the Soviet Union quote. Asked whether the euro would survive, he said: It could last quite a long time, the same way as the Soviet Union, which was a very bad arrangement, lasted for 70 years. However, I think that eventually, it is bound to break up the European Union. The longer it will take, and it may take generations, those will be lost in terms of political freedom and economic prosperity. The solution is to me a terrible tragedy for the EU. And it's happening to the most developed open society in the world. To me it's a terrible tragedy. It doesn't have villains, because I don't think that Germany is doing it with bad intentions but it's happening out of a lack of understanding of very complex problems. My colleague Heather Stewart has just pointed out two rather sobering charts in Carney's written evidence to the Treasury Select Committee. The first shows how reliant the UK still is on slow-growing advanced economies, with some 66% of exports in 2011, going to these markets, and just 12.9% going to the emerging markets. The second chart is a stark depiction of the UK's desperate performance in exports in general. And here's Neil Prothero of the Economist Intelligence Unit with a helpful summing up of Carney's appearance at the TSC, so far. Irrespective of who heads the Bank of England, ultra-loose monetary policy in the UK will persist in some form for a long time to come, given the structural weakness of the economy and because the government views it as a necessary counterbalance to its protracted fiscal austerity programme. Some changes to the inflation-targeting policy framework are, however, likely to be considered once Mark Carney succeeds Mervyn King as governor in July, since the Canadian appears to hold a more optimistic view than Mr King that there is more that monetary policy can do to stimulate the economy at the \"zero lower bound\" (when nominal policy rates are close to 0%). Initially, this is likely to focus on adopting a more flexible inflation-targeting framework, which could include providing more \"forward guidance\" on the future path of monetary policy (for example, an explicit commitment that rates would remain at 0.5% for a stated duration) and/or threshold rules similar to those recently adopted by the US Federal Reserve. A major shake-up of the Bank's remit in the near term, such as a move to target nominal GDP or earnings, seems unlikely, but could still occur over time. Events could well force Mr Carney's hand, should traditional monetary policy tools (including QE) continue to disappoint and the UK economy continues to stagnate.\u201d Right, Carney's back in the hotseat. We'll be keeping one eye on that, as well as covering the ECB press conference at 1.30pm. Here's Capital Economics on the messages coming from the Bank of England and its incoming governor Mark Carney today. Not only did the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) leave policy on hold again today, but in his testimony to the Treasury Committee, Governor-to-be Mark Carney sounded less keen than before on a change in the monetary framework. Nonetheless, he was keen at least to review whether it needs changing, leaving the door open to a shake-up at the Bank of England when he arrives in July. And... the ECB has also left rates on hold at 0.75%. We'll have more from the European Central Bank at Mario Draghi's press conference at 1.30pm. And the TSC is breaking but only for five minutes. You look a fit man, says Tyrie. Carney is asked about helicopter money, see 8.58am. I cannot envision any circumstance where I would support [helicopter money]. He says there is flexibility in existing tools available to the Bank of England. Really? It seems this is only the first half of the Carney hearing and we are merely approaching a break in proceedings. That's quite a marathon for Carney's first appearance in front of the Treasury Select Committee. Still, he's retained his calm so far and seems to have charmed the MPs. It's no wonder the pound doesn't know which way it's going. On the one hand, the Bank of England is saying it stands ready to provide additional monetary stimulus if required. Economists at Newedge note: This suggests more QE is possible in May if recovery stalls and/or eurozone/US risks come back. On the other hand, incoming bank chief Carney is saying returns from QE diminish as the scale of the programme is increased. Just a reminder, RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton is in the Guardian building and ready to answer readers' questions about the \u00a3390m fine the bank is paying to settle allegations it rigged Libor. The webchat will take place from 12.30pm. Post your questions for the RBS chairman in the comments section here. Carney says that evidence from Bank of Canada suggests that returns have declined from the QE programme, as the scale of it has expanded. Those comments from the Bank of England appear to have hit sterling, which is now only up 0.25% on the day at $1.57. More from the Bank of England, which has unusually issued a statement with its interest rate decision. (Could this be the start of a more open central bank, preparing for Carney's entry?) It says it is appropriate to look beyond the fact that inflation is currently running above target, as removing stimulus would risk derailing the recovery. Back to Carney, who says he does not expect to say much about fiscal policy and he does not expect the government to speak about monetary policy. Carney refutes the FT story this morning, which suggests Osborne has been putting pressure on the Bank of England over growth. He says he is not meeting with the chancellor this week. The Bank of England says inflation is likely to rise further in the near term and remain above 2% for the next two years. UK economic output appears to be broadly flat. Business surveys point to muted growth in near term. And the Bank of England has left rates and the quantitative easing programme unchanged. No great surprise there. The bank says it sees a slow and sustained recovery in the economy, but says the risks are to the downside (ie it's more likely that things turn out worse than forecasts, not better). John Mann has come up with some good questions (at last). He is pushing Carney on his use of the word 'flexible' when talking about inflation targeting. He says the talk of flexibility is a new notion in the UK and asks whether this gives politicians scope to put pressure on the Bank of England. Carney says: There is no question about my independence as governor of the Bank of England. There is a governance structure that has been put in place, there is an absolutely clear structure. He says the bank will be given a remit and will execute against that remit. No political influence will come to bear on the execution of that remit. Overall feeling is that Carney has not been as revolutionary as some had hoped/feared. Six minutes and counting until the Bank of England announces its decision from the most recent monetary policy committee meeting. Will it try and steal the limelight from Carney by announcing a change to monetary policy? Unlikely. Carney is asked if the Bank of England should be questioing its own remit - ie asking whether the inflation target is the right target. Carney says: The bank is very well informed on not just the conduct and the effectiveness of the current remit. The bank can play a role in informing that debate. If the bank were invited to question its remit, it is reasonable to respond. Active questioning of that remit can make it less effective. Once a remit is given then the bank's job is to execute against that. Nominal GDP targeting can be useful in the exceptional circumstances that the UK finds itself in, says Carney. That means it is entirely appropriate for the UK to consider it. But he says, My inclination is that flexible inflation targeting \u2013 potentially deployed in a slightly different way \u2013 would remain superior [to nominal GDP targeting]. Carney says he is \"far from convinced\" that the bank should move to nominal GDP targeting, but says it is a valid part of the debate if one is looking at a framework. Carney confirms he has spoken to chancellor George Osborne about the merits of changing the BoE's remit. He says: My view is that the best framework remains flexbile inflation targeting. But he says there are advantages to nominal GDP targeting, which could allow for higher inflation in case of a slump. Did his flexibility over this key question help him get the job? asks C4 News' economics editor. Carney says if more stimulus is required when he is in office he will do his best to persuade other MPC members. But it is not entirely clear that is his focus. His spoken comments seem to be pointing the other way. He says the current state of the UK economy and the labour market merit considerable monetary stimulus for a considerable period of time. That may require new tools... It is the responsibility of the BOE to review the tools it uses and if need be for stimulus to devise new instruments. The pound has surged on the back of Mark Carney's remarks, driven by suggestions in his written evidence that the central bank must exit 'unconventional monetary policy'. Sterling rose 0.5% on the day to $1.575. More from our banking editor Jill Treanor, on what Carney said on the banks: On competition in banking he thinks more needs to be done. He points out there is direct relationship between banking concentration and financial stability. Some countries (Canada, Australia) with concentrated systems proved more stable during the crisis. Others (the UK, Netherlands and Switzerland) did not. \"It is clear that concentration makes instability more costly\" as the two largest lenders \u2013 Lloyds and RBS \u2013 account for 45 per cent of the total stock of lending. And both were bailed out. Opening up the market to new competition means that barriers to entry - essentially getting authorisation from the Prudential Regulation Authority - need to be eased and that some banks will need to fail. \"With a deposit guarantee scheme and a resolution regime in place, banks, particularly smaller ones, will be able to fail without threatening the stability of the banking system as a whole. It follows that the prudential requirements on new entrants can, and should, be lighter than they have been in the past, although some minimum standards must of course be maintained. \"The PRA is therefore reforming its authorisation requirements for banks in ways that reduce barriers to entry. We all need to recognise and accept that, under this regime, new entrants to the banking market may, from time to time, fail, but that this the flipside of a market that is truly open to competition\". My colleague Jill Treanor writes: Carney's written evidence covers ending too big too fail in the banking sector. \"Restoring capitalism to the capitalists\" - ie avoiding taxpayer bailouts - \"discipline\" in the system will increase and systemic risk reduced. He puts much hope in new mechanisms being designed by the Financial Stability Board. \"Some countries need to legislate, not merely propose,\" he says. In times of crisis he makes clear that much hinges on the relationship between the governor and the chancellor. \"Effective crisis management cannot, however, be legislated. It requires contingency planning during \u2018peacetime\u2019, decisiveness if \u2018war\u2019 breaks out and, more than anything else, a good working relationship between the Bank and HM Treasury, and ultimately between Governor and Chancellor. That will be the focus of my efforts\". And another snippet from Carney's written evidence. Asked whether he would consider wading into foreign exchange rates to affect the value of the pound, Carney pointed out that the MPC has that right, as part of its remit, and he would recommend exercising it in an \"extreme scenario\". He is asked about comments he has made that communications from the central bank can help manage market expectations. He says the view in the Bank of Canada is that in normal times policy guidance is not very helpful. It would not move market expectations. But, he says, when the Bank of Canada had got interest rates as low as they could go, it had to consider other policy choices. We felt we could use communication to provide the extra stimulus. It sent a message there was going to be stimulus for a set amount of time, so that people could plan and put in place if they were going to buy a house or renovate. They had time to act on this. Everybody knew about this commitment in Canada. And it had an effect. It was a conditional commitment. In part because of the response [to the communication], we ended up raising interest rates sooner than we had said. Made the outlook conditional on inflation. Looking at the UK, he says, there is a valid discussion to be had about the potential use of this tool. Is the UK's inflation target too flexible, Carney is asked. He says the nature of the question reinforces the point. There should be a shared understanding of the flexibility that is there. Over what period does the bank need to get back to the inflation target? In these exceptional economic circumstances, with inflation above target, it would be useful to have a shared understanding of what is the optimal timeline to return [to the target] and why. There is merit to considering the Fed-style threshold-based guidance. Does one make that [threshold] time-contingent, or state-contingent, [i.e.] is it around a specific economic variable? Asked about quantitative easing... should the bank have a wider consideration of the full effects of QE? Carney says yes. He's looking forward to contributing to the TSC's review of QE. There are distributional consequences of QE. All monetary policy has distributional consequences. The response to those is [someone else's job]. He says the central bank's 12 meetings a year \"verges on too many\". Carney reiterates that he is ready for internal Bank of England members to disagree with him, and he is prepared to be outvoted. I would like to be on the right side more often than not. I fully imagine during the course of my term I will be outvoted. The key issue, says Carney, is the time period over which inflation must return to the 2% target. Carney says flexible inflation targeting is the most successful monetary framework in existence but debate should be encouraged. The flexible inflation-targeting framework should remain broadly in place, but details need to be reviewed and could be changed. Can we turn to monetary policy, says Tyrie, finally. Is the UK's monetary framework \u2013 ie flexible inflation targeting \u2013 the right one, he asks. Carney: In Canada we review our framework every five years. We have found that is an effective process. It ensures shared understanding about the 'flexible' word in 'flexible inflation targeting' In an exceptional envrionment, it is important to ensure there is buy-in to the current framework. He says the bar to change the framework is set very high. Carney says others should decide if reform of the Court of the Bank of England is needed: I hesitate as a foreigner coming in and suggesting changes to the longer traditions of the [Bank of England]. Others should make those judgments rather than me. Mark Carney tells MPs he won't be an \"emperor\" when he's in charge at the Bank of England. My colleague Jill Treanor is ploughing through Mark Carney's written evidence, which runs to 45 pages. She writes: On the key issue of monetary policy where he caused a storm in December by suggesting banks might need to ditch inflation targets and use nominal GDP targets instead. He says he has not \"made an assessment of the merits of altering the monetary policy framework in the UK\" but then goes on to a lengthy explanation on what he did in Canada which reviews its target every five years and he suggests that it should be \"debated periodically\" here in the light of \"current extraordinary circumstances\" He talks about the need for the Bank to \"enhance its forecasting, building on the recent Stockton review to make forecasts more accurate, transparent and better integrated with policy analysis\". And crucially he also spells out the need to \"design, implement and ultimately exit from unconventional monetary policy measures in a manner that reinforces public confidence.\" He backs the proposals by Sir John Vickers' independent commission on banking to erect ringfences around retail and investment banks. \"The implicit state subsidy for banks needs to be removed,\" he said. The Chancellor had originally wanted a governor who would serve an eight year term and justifies his decision to only agree to do it for five years. \"A five-year term is the right managerial timeline to re-launch the Bank of England with its broader responsibilities, and to develop considerable talent, undertake targeted external recruitment, and build a succession plan. \"Over the five years, we can establish the full potential of the new institutional structure, which combines monetary policy, macroprudential and microprudential regulation.\" And by 2018, when his terms end, the Vickers proposals will be in place, he argues. Finally, from a personal perspective, there are two considerations. By the end of five years he will have been a bank boss for over a decade - \"there are limits to these highly rewarding but ultimately punishing jobs\". Plus it suits the ages of his children. And a bit of wishful thinking from Carney, who writes: \"More generally, I would like to achieve an exit in 2018 that is less newsworthy than my entrance. That can be achieved if: the Bank\u2019s existing functions are reaffirmed; its new functions are embedded and understood; a strong leadership team is in place; the credibility of, and trust in, the institution are entrenched; and there is increased recognition that while the Bank of England\u2019s actions provide the cornerstones of British prosperity\u2014price and financial stability\u2014these are necessary but not sufficient conditions for growth\" More on that, as it comes in... He admits that the central bank is not infallible: The Bank of England will make mistakes, all institutions make mistakes. Carney says, given that the bank is being given extra responsibilities, that means he will have to reconfirm or adjust vision for the institution. Says that will be his job for the first six months of his tenure. Some analysis of Carney's comments coming in. Annalisa Piazza of Newedge Strategy: Some of Carney's comments suggest that he favours some changes in the Bank of England's policy framework. Nevertheless, we rule out that changes will be abrupt as he sounds very keen on maintaining confidence in the institution's credibility. Peter Dixon, Commerzbank: Much of it is really suggesting what central bankers around the world have already talked about, in other words price stability is the main thing to focus on. One thing people talked about ahead of the hearing was his views on nominal GDP targeting, and he says well yes it's an option in the vent that interest rates need a bit more traction, so he's not ruling anything out or ruling anything in. Slightly odd line of questioning from one MP, asking Carney to define various pieces of jargon. Carney says: Capital ratio is a ratio of the equity in an institution relative to the assets. Unwinding QE is to return the balance sheet of the Bank of England to its historic level. Tyrie says he gets full marks, prompting a rare laugh from the packed-out room. Carney on his own management style: As governor i will from time to time be in the minority. That is 'fine'. My job is to ensure all views are heard. It will not always be possible to have consensus on the Bank of Engalnd's MPC and FPC. Tyrie notes that in the written evidence Carney talks about his management style, suggesting consensus is key. Is that in contrast to Mervyn King, he asks. Carney says King has always been 'consensual' in committees he has taken part in. Carney says inequality and persistent unemployment can be a factor in monetary policy. He expresses real concern about long term unemployment and suggests aggressive monetary policy should be used to counter it. Some headlines from the written evidence... Carney: BOE Could Intervene On Exchange Rate In Extreme Scenario Carney: BOE Will Need To Design Exit From Unconventional Policies He's asked whether he would extend his term if he feels he hasn't achieved his goals. He says 'no' in a very long and convoluted manner. His daughter doesn't get a mention, although I'm sure that's one reason. Instead he says clarity is crucial, so it's wrong to put a question mark over what is currently a finite timeline. Carney tries to put a line under questions about his pay... My pay and pension is equivalent to the pay and pension of the current governor. The housing allowance relates to the fact that I am moving from one of the cheapest capitals to one of the most expensive capitals. I would add further that the combination of the two is broadly equivalent to the pay and pension of the outgoing CEO of the FSA. Carney's being asked about his \u00a3250,000 housing allowance. He says it is pretty normal to equalise living standards from where he is coming to where he arrives. And justifies it by saying he's moving from one of the least expensive housing markets to one of the most expensive. Tyrie describes it as \"a novelty, at least\", the fact that Carney says timing and location of his daughters' education was crucial in his decision about taking this job. Here's the link to Mark Carney's written evidence to the Treasury Select Committee. There's a whopping 45 pages of it, but my colleague Jill Treanor is scouring it for any intriguing details. More shortly... Carney is asked why he changed his mind over the governor job. He says he originally said no due to concerns about moving his children between schools. Andrew Tyrie on the committee clarifies that he's more interested in why he then changed his mind. Carney is stumbling a bit, but says the possibility of reducing the governor's term to five years was decisive because of his eldest daughter's schooling needs. Do bank governors on \u00a31m a year take the tube? Maybe Carney got caught out by problems on the underground this morning. Still no sign of the Bank of England's incoming chief over at the Treasury Select Committee. Although the live stream has started here. Looks like a full turnout from the MPs at least. UK trade and industrial production figures are also in. Industrial output rose more than expected in December, although oil field shutdowns drove the biggest quarterly fall since early 2009. Manufacturing output climbed 1.6%, after a fall of 0.3% in November Separate data from the Office for National Statistics showed that Britain's goods trade deficit narrowed in December. Peter Dixon of Commerzbank said: The key point is manufacturing output is still 1.5% lower than it was a year ago, so although it was a good month in December, the trend clearly has not been very friendly over the last 12 months. Hopefully we will get a little more strength in the course of 2013 as the eurozone crisis begins to normalise, but obviously it's going to be a slow haul for the manufacturing sector. Just in, Spain has sold \u20ac4.61bn worth of bonds compared with a target of \u20ac3.5bn-\u20ac4.5bn. Borrowing costs rose, with the maximum yield on the March 2015 bond at 2.889% compared with 2.587% on January 10. That is no doubt a reaction to the growing political instability in Spain, following allegations of corruption in the ruling PP party. Back to Carney, it will also be intriguing to see how the Canadian reacts to the typically aggressive questioning of the Treasury Select Committee... Before we head over to the Thatcher Room for the Treasury Select Committee, there are some better economic signs from Dublin. My colleague Henry McDonald reports: Liquidating the Anglo Irish Bank can only improve Ireland's economic situation, the former deputy chief of the International Monetary Fund said this morning. Last night both houses of the Irish Parliament rushed through legislation to close down the now nationalised bank that almost bankrupted the Republic. It meant that Ireland will avoid having to pay a punitive IOU to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders of more than \u20ac3bn at the end of next month. That debt will now be spread over into a long term government bond. Speaking on RTE's Morning Ireland, former IMF deputy director Donal Donovan said it would reduce the amount the government had to find every year to pay back the the debt. \"By reducing the \u20ac3.1bn principal repayment, pushing it out, we are doing two things: first of all we're reducing the amount the government has to find every year to borrow from the markets in order to come up with this \u20ac3.1bn - it's not going to be zero, but it'll be likely to be much less,\" Mr Donovan said. \"Second, by pushing it out, we are giving the opportunity for the country to grow and for recovery to take place, so that when we do start to repay this down the road, the cost is not going to be so great. That's not a trivial thing.\" The move requires approval from the European Central Bank, which may be endorsed in Frankfurt later today. The historic Anglo Irish Bank debt had been costing Irish taxpayers \u20ac3.1bn each year. Although 800 jobs are at risk as a result of liquidating Anglo which was renamed under state control the IBRC Irish government sources said many of these posts could be saved by re-directing towards the National Assets Management Agency - the body which is in charge of toxic, debt ridden assets banks owned and later had to hand over to the Irish state. It will be interesting to see how the MPs treat Mark Carney at his first Treasury Select Committee hearing in about a quarter of an hour from now. The Bank of Canada's appointment was warmly received when it was announced last year. But, Simon Nixon argues in the Wall Street Journal, that \"some of the Carney gloss is coming off\". He writes: It is fair to say that in the two months since his appointment, some of the gloss has come off Mr. Carney's reputation\u2014and that some of this damage is self-inflicted. First, he notes that Carney's decision to seek a pay package worth more than \u00a31m, will make his job harder as it risks reinforcing the perception that he is a globe-trotting hired gun with no deep commitment to the UK. That will only inflame hostility towards him if and when the central bank is forced to take unpopular decisions. But, writes Nixon, the governor-elect has also made his life more difficult by questioning the Bank of England's prized inflation target. The more puzzling self-inflicted wound was Mr. Carney's decision to float the idea that the BOE might drop its inflation target in favor of a nominal GDP target. This piece of kite-flying, which appears to have been coordinated with the Treasury, has been almost universally dismissed by market economists and fellow central bankers. Adam Posen, a former U.K. rate-setter with a reputation as a \"dove\" who consistently played down inflation concerns and favored greater central-bank stimulus, told Parliament last month that abandoning the inflation target would be a \"grievous error\" that would raise unnecessary concerns over the U.K.'s commitment to sound money. Another former U.K. rate-setter and arch-dove, David Blanchflower, has pointed out that even if nominal-GDP targeting was a good idea in theory, it is a bad idea in practice because nominal GDP is hard to measure and prone to large revisions. Back to the EU budget talks, which will be discussed late into the night tonight, with no decision expected until tomorrow morning at the very earliest. It seems German Chancellor Angela Merkel was preparing the ground last night, with a trip to Paris where she tried to strike a deal with French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande ahead of the talks (while taking in the football). My colleague Ian Traynor writes: A senior German official said the differences between [France and Germany] were slight and they expected to agree on a \"common direction\" for EU spending. Hollande said on Tuesday his bottom line was \u20ac960bn for the 2014-2020 period, a figure which coincides with Berlin's marker of 1% of EU GDP. That figure refers to \"commitments\" in EU parlance, meaning legally binding budget pledges for EU projects. Britain, meanwhile, is pushing for a lower figure. Ian Traynor dissects the different countries' positions in an excellent preview here. Looking ahead to Mark Carney's appearance before MPs this morning, Ed Conway of Sky notes the growing political influence on central bankers around the world. He says this could, in turn, raise the prospect of so called 'helicopter money'. This refers to pure money financing of the deficit. For example, the government may send every family in the country a one-off 'bonus' of \u00a31,000, directly financed by money created by the Bank of England. Carney is unlikely to broach such a controversial topic in his hearing this morning, but it will be interesting to see whether he refers to expanding the central bank's arsenal in tackling crises. Also on the Guardian website today, the chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland will be appearing live to answer readers' questions about the \u00a3390m fine the bank is paying to settle allegations it rigged Libor. The webchat will take place from 12.30pm GMT on 7 February. Post your questions for the RBS chairman in the comments section here As the EU leaders gear up for the budget talks, we look at how much each individual European citizen 'gives to' or 'takes from' the European project. Flick through our budget interactive: to find out where your money goes. How much do French farmers benefit from you personally? What about a Polish justice project? Calculate your own contributions to European initiatives in different countries. Then we've got decisions from both the Bank of England and European Central Bank, following their monthly meetings to discuss interest rates and any stimulus measures. The Bank of England is likely to hold rates steady and any decision on expanding the quantitative easing programme will be left until after the latest inflation report, which is out next week. The bank might, however, announce what it plans to do with proceeds of \u00a36.1bn of gilts maturing early next month, The ECB is also expected to retain the status quo. But all eyes will be on Mario Draghi when he gives a press conference at 1.30pm. Questions will likely focus on the strength of the euro and what, if anything, he intends to do about it. But first up, we've got the central bankers. At 9.45 this morning, we'll be hearing from Mark Carney, incoming chief of the Bank of England, when he faces a panel of MPs at the Treasury Select Committee. We will be live-blogging the hearing, which you can also watch online. Among other things, the MPs are likely to ask Carney whether he thinks the central bank should be doing more to drive the UK economy. His response either way could move the markets, as investors anticipate a new regime at Threadneedle Street. Carney has made references to targeting nominal GDP, rather than inflation, which could allow for higher inflation during a slump. Markets will be looking to see whether he expands on that theme, but he is likely to keep details to a minimum before he takes the reins in June. Good morning and welcome back to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other key events in the global economy. EU leaders will be heading to Brussels today for what is likely to be another gruelling summit to discuss the region's trillion-euro budget. The talks will pit Britain against France, after French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande singled out the UK as the biggest obstacle to a breakthrough agreement. This week's summit follows a failed first attempt to reach a deal on the budget in November, with the British arguing for further reductions of at least \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn) on the overall package of \u20ac973bn proposed by Herman Van Rompuy, the summit chair. My colleague Ian Traynor reports: European leaders are inching towards a deal on the EU\u2019s new seven-year trillion-euro budget that should allow David Cameron to argue he has succeeded in forcing a real cut in Brussels spending. The figures, exploiting a big gap between pledged spending and a more accurate estimate of what probably will be spent, will be fiercely contested at a two-day summit opening on Thursday in Brussels. The signals on Wednesday evening, however, were that two separate sets of spending forecasts would be confected enabling the main players to claim victory from very different positions. EU leaders failed to agree on the new seven-year budget in November and a fresh failure over the next few days is likely to throw EU medium-term spending plans into acute disarray We'll have his full preview up online shortly.",

The loss-making stores, including all five Edinburgh sites, three in Glasgow and four in London, will close over the next two months and comes as administrators from Deloittes plan to sell the company's flagship Oxford Street store. Joint administrator Nick Edwards said: \"As part of our ongoing review of HMV's financial position, we have now completed a review of the store portfolio and have identified 66 loss-making stores for closure. This step has been taken in order to enhance the prospects of securing the business' future as a going concern. \"We continue to receive strong support from staff and are extremely grateful to them for their commitment during an understandably difficult period. All other key stakeholders remain very supportive and I continue to be hopeful of securing a future for the restructured business.\" HMV called in administrators in early January after poor Christmas sales. A further 3,000 jobs are at risk. At first gift cards, worth around \u00a37m, were suspended, but these were later reinstated after a customer backlash. Restructuring group Hilco took over the retailer's debts of around \u00a3176m from its lenders, including Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, giving it effective control of the business but not ownership. Hilco is thought to have the support of music labels including Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony for any takeover, having already bought HMV Canada in 2011. It is thought that RBS and Lloyds were owed around \u00a330m each as HMV's biggest secured creditors. It is not known how much Hilco paid to take control, but it is expected to be well below the \u00a360m the banks were owed. The 930 job losses \u2013 the first shopfloor redundancies at the firm \u2013 add to the 190 losses at HMV's head office and distribution arm and led to the company's official Twitter account being hijacked by soon-to-be sacked staff who live-tweeted a meeting with HR at which they learned their fate. This included \"There are over 60 of us being fired at once! Mass execution, of loyal employees who love the brand. #hmvXFactorFiring\" Followed by: \"Just overheard our Marketing Director (he's staying, folks!) ask \"How do I shut down Twitter?\" Later on, the employee, identified as Poppy Rose, said: \"I hoped that today's actions would finally show them the true power and importance of Social Media, and I hope they're finally listening.\"",
