      "bodyText": "The Institute of Directors (IoD) has backed Theresa May\u2019s decision to review the \u00a318.5bn Hinkley nuclear scheme but launched a savage attack on successive government policies for failing to deliver energy security. The traditionally conservative employers group also released an opinion poll showing three-quarters of its members supported action to counter climate change with strong backing for solar, wind, and even tidal power. Only 9% of the 1,000 bosses \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d that the proposed new reactors at Hinkley Point C would make Britain more economically competitive. Less than a fifth strongly believed Hinkley would make the UK more strategically secure although a different poll taken 12 months ago showed a huge majority in general favour of new nuclear power stations being constructed. \u201cThe IoD backs nuclear as a reliable source of low-carbon energy, but each project has to make economic sense. Hinkley Point C would generate reliable power for 5m homes, but given the costs, the government is right to take one final look before signing off,\u201d said Dan Lewis, senior infrastructure policy adviser at the IoD. However, Lewis attacked ministers of all parties for focusing on reducing carbon emissions but underplaying the other two \u201ccrucial aims of energy policy\u201d, delivering secure and affordable power. \u201cGovernment policy at the moment is creating all sorts of bizarre outcomes. Instead of accelerating moves to safely frack for gas and oil in the UK, we are importing coal and oil from Russia, and gas and oil from Norway, with the extra costs and emissions that involves. \u201cInstead of building cleaner gas plants to meet demand when renewables can\u2019t, the government has been subsidising more polluting diesel-fired plants,\u201d he added. The IoD survey shows members are split over shale exploration with only 53% strongly or somewhat in favour with nearly 30% strongly or somewhat opposed. Around 14% of those surveyed neither supported nor opposed fracking, while a very high 53% strongly supported solar arrays, with 45% similarly in favour of offshore wind and 57% behind wave and tidal, neither of which have been tested at scale in Britain. Hinkley has been put under new scrutiny following the EU referendum and decision by David Cameron to quit as prime minister. A final decision by new business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, is expected next month. EDF, the French promoter of the scheme, took a final investment decision to proceed with the Somerset project after a raft of delays but Hinkley\u2019s many critics believe the scheme is too expensive. A previous government agreed to pay EDF a guaranteed price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for the 35-year duration of the scheme, even though the current cost of wholesale electricity is half that figure.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Deutsche Bank whistleblower has turned down his share of the $16.5m whistleblower award, stating that the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) did not do enough to punish the executives responsible for the bank\u2019s wrongdoing. Eric Ben-Artzi, a former risk officer, went to the regulators after he was fired by Deutsche Bank for raising alarm over the bank\u2019s inflated valuation of its portfolio of credit derivatives. According to him, by imposing a $55m fine on the bank but letting the executives off scot-free, the SEC has instead punished the bank\u2019s \u201crank-and-file\u201d employees and shareholders. \u201cI request that my share of the award be given to Deutsche and its stakeholders,\u201d he wrote on Thursday in an opinion piece published by the Financial Times. (Ben-Artzi was eligible to receive $8.25m, according to the FT.) He noted that financial award was a \u201cpowerful incentive\u201d when he first decided to help SEC and that he is not \u201cat liberty to reject\u201d the award since portion of it belongs to his lawyers and his ex-wife. Ben-Artzi said that the result of SEC\u2019s lengthy investigation was \u201cdisappointing\u201d and that \u201ctop executives retired with multimillion-dollar bonuses based on the misrepresentation of the bank\u2019s balance sheet\u201d. The reason why Deutsche Bank was only subject to a $55m fine is that its top lawyers have long been \u201crevolved\u201d in and out of the SEC, according to Ben-Artzi. \u201cRobert Rice, the chief lawyer in charge of the internal investigation at Deutsche in 2011, became the SEC\u2019s chief counsel in 2013,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRobert Khuzami, Deutsche\u2019s top lawyer in North America, became head of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division after the financial crisis. Their boss, Richard Walker, the bank\u2019s longtime general counsel (he left the bank this year) was once head of enforcement at the SEC.\u201d Ben-Artzi added that Mary Jo White, the current chair of the SEC, has known both Rice and Khuzami for as long as 20 years. She \u201cbears the ultimate responsibility for the Deutsche fine\u201d, he wrote. \u201cWe brought all of the charges supported by the evidence and the law, which were unanimously approved by the Commission,\u201d Andrew Ceresney, director of the division of enforcement, said in a statement provided to the Guardian. White\u2019s ties to the banking industry had previously drawn ire from Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. Last year, Warren sent White a 13-page letter telling her that she found her performance as Wall Street\u2019s top cop \u201cdisappointing\u201d. Ben-Artzi, who was fired by Rice, said that being let go ruined his Wall Street career. He now works as vice-president of risk analytics at BondIT, a fixed-income portfolio management company. Sherron Watkins, who blew the whistle on accounting irregularities at Enron, previously said that more than a decade later she was unable to get a job in corporate America. \u201cI have this label \u2018whistleblower\u2019 which is synonymous with troublemaker,\u201d she said in 2014, before praising SEC\u2019s whistleblower program. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of the story of even the most well-known whistleblowers ... You are out of your industry. That\u2019s why I welcome this program, because you have to reinvent yourself and it\u2019s not always easy. Rarely do people have the notoriety that I have, where I am on the lecture circuit. It\u2019s a problem.\u201d In his op-ed, Ben-Artzi said that while he needs the award money \u201cnow more than ever\u201d, he will \u201cnot join the looting\u201d of the Deutsche Bank shareholders. \u201cI never intended to turn a job in risk management into a crusade, but after suffering at the hands of the Deutsche executives I will not join them simply because I cannot beat them,\u201d he wrote. He added that he would happily collect the award if the money was \u201cclawed back from the bonuses paid to the Deutsche executives, especially the former top SEC attorneys\u201d. Earlier this year, while awarding its second largest whistleblower award at $17m, SEC noted that the award program is instrumental in encouraging people with insider knowledge to come forward. By June, the SEC whistleblower program had awarded more than $85m to 32 whistleblowers. According to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal, more awards are coming. SEC settlements with State Street Corp and Bank of New York Mellon Corp could lead to a number of whistleblower awards totaling $100m, according to WSJ. Public coverage of the award announcement often leads to more tips being sent to the SEC. Yet as Ben-Artzi\u2019s op-ed shows, the results are not always to the whistleblower\u2019s liking. According to the Financial Times, Ben-Artzi is the first whistleblower to refuse an award since the program was launched in 2011.",

      "bodyText": "Pity Ivanka Trump. She can\u2019t even shop without her father\u2019s presidential campaign getting in the way, as she learned this week when she received a dose of politics alongside her order from Lady Grey jewelry. After Trump ordered an $84 \u201cear cuff\u201d \u2013 a golden sleeve for her ear cartilage \u2013 from the jewelry designers Jill Martinelli and Sabine Le Guyader, the daughter of the would-be president received a note informing her that the money made from her purchase had been donated to organizations opposing her father\u2019s campaign. In their note to Trump, the two designers wrote: Dear Ivanka, Thank you for your web order! We\u2019re happy to let you know that the proceeds of your sale have been generously donated to the American Immigration Council, the Everytown for Gun Safety Organization, and the Hillary Clinton campaign. We hope you enjoy your new Lady Grey #helixcuff. Best, Sabine and Jill. The note, which was sent to Trump last week, was posted on Instagram on Tuesday. By Thursday afternoon, it had garnered more than 7,300 likes and nearly 3,300 comments. However, not all the comments were positive; some users accused the designers of using Trump\u2019s order as a publicity stunt, and others felt they had behaved unprofessionally. \u201cWhile we were flattered to receive an order from Ivanka Trump, our social and political views couldn\u2019t be further from those of the Trump campaign. When we received her order, we instantly felt compelled to take the money and donate it to a few organizations that were more aligned with our ideals \u2013 Everytown for Gun Safety, the American Immigration Council, and the Hillary Clinton Campaign,\u201d the duo told the Guardian in a statement. \u201cWe strongly feel that everyone and anyone can make a difference through actively supporting the causes that they believe in, no matter how big or small. We decided to share this letter to make that statement, and hopefully inspire people to follow suit.\u201d Lady Grey is not the only business donating profits from its business to organizations lobbying for political causes. Just recently, the makers of Cards Against Humanity, an irreverent card game, launched two expansion packs, one for Clinton and one for Trump \u2013 but the company made clear from the outset who they were backing. \u201cWe\u2019re letting America choose between two new expansion packs about either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump,\u201d they said. \u201cAt the end of this promotion, Cards Against Humanity will tally up the sales of both packs, and depending on which pack gets more support, we will donate all the money in support of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d Each pack costs $4.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of jobs are at risk at one of Britain\u2019s biggest high street retailers, Monsoon Accessorize, after it decided to close its largest shops. The retailer has called time on having the Monsoon and Accessorize brands in a single shop and will close the dual outlets across the country as their leases expire over the next five years. A total of 141 stores will be affected. The company will look to open separate Monsoon and Accessorize shops in the areas with joint outlets, but job losses are possible. Monsoon Accessorize employs 5,500 people across the UK and has more than 300 shops. Monsoon, however, the women\u2019s fashion chain, is struggling in the face of fierce competition on the high street. A source close to the company said the crossover between Monsoon and Accessorize customers was \u201cactually lower than you would think\u201d. Monsoon is thought to attract slightly older shoppers than Accessorize, which mostly sells jewellery. The restructuring is part of a wide-ranging strategic overhaul led by the new chief executive, Paul Allen. It is a reversal of the strategy pursued under the former boss John Browett, who previously ran Dixons and Apple\u2019s retail business and now runs the homeware group Dunelm. Browett expanded the number of joint Monsoon and Accessorize stores, but the company\u2019s bosses now believe this was a mistake. Browett stepped down as Monsoon Accessorize\u2019s boss early last year. He was replaced by Allen, the former boss of the upmarket womenswear brand Jacques Vert, on an interim basis before the appointment was made permanent in January. There have been rumours that Monsoon Accessorize was considering a company voluntary arrangement, an insolvency procedure that allows a retailer to walk away from its rental agreements and close stores quickly. Company sources, however, said this was \u201cnonsense\u201d given its financial strength. Monsoon Acccesorize is owned by the tycoon Peter Simon, who started Monsoon in the 1970s with a market stall on Portobello Road. The first Accessorize shop opened in 1984 after Monsoon started to sell a small collection of fashion accessories which proved popular. Simon and his family are now worth more than \u00a3500m, but the latest financial results for the parent company reveal pressure on the high street retailer. Drillgreat Limited suffered a 9% drop in sales to \u00a3465m in the year to the end of August 2015, including a 5% drop in like-for-like sales in the UK, and racked up a pre-tax loss of \u00a3155m. Allen said in the accounts that Monsoon Accessorize had a disappointing year, describing Monsoon\u2019s performance as poor as it was hindered by unseasonable weather and heavy discounting by its high street rivals. He said the company had launched a \u201cfar-reaching strategic reorganisation programme to address the principal issues which are depressing profitability\u201d. He said: \u201cThese actions include refocusing the way the group\u2019s three brands \u2013 Accessorize, Monsoon Ladies and Monsoon Children \u2013 are operated in the UK, with different strategies to address their distinct core customer propositions, continuing to reshape the UK property portfolio, and reshaping the international business for the future.\u201d The company has also promoted Nikki Hamwee to the role of Monsoon Ladies brand director, focusing the international business on Europe and the Middle East - with store closures in other parts of the world - and it has agreed deals with Debenhams, House of Fraser and Amazon to sell Monsoon clothing. Monsoon Accessorize declined to comment on the plan to close the joint stores or the number of jobs that could be affected.",

      "bodyText": "Here is a tip for Sports Direct that could save Mike Ashley a few bob. Rather than bringing in highly-paid consultants to evaluate the company\u2019s board, just ask your shareholders. City institutions would swiftly tell Ashley that Sports Direct needs a credible chairman and a permanent finance director. The fact that Sports Direct chose to publicly announce that it will conduct an \u201cexternal evaluation\u201d of its board suggests one problem is already clear. Keith Hellawell is not performing as chairman. The UK corporate governance code stipulates that FTSE companies should appoint a third party to review their board at least every three years, but it is unusual for a company to announce the evaluation publicly as Sports Direct did. The company should not need a third party to identify the strengths and weaknesses of its board. The chairman should already know them and the company\u2019s shareholders should be confident that he does. Investors have had concerns about Hellawell\u2019s suitability since he was appointed in November 2009. The former policeman made his name as the chief constable of West Yorkshire and the government\u2019s drugs tsar, but had limited experience of the private sector. At first, such concerns were put to one side because Sport Direct\u2019s share price was rising and the retailer had previously been without a permanent chairman for more than two years after David Richardson, an experienced executive, quit following clashes with the rest of the board. Frustration has grown after criticism of Sport Direct\u2019s working practices, a chastening appearance by Hellawell in front of a parliamentary committee last year and Ashley buying shares in other retailers such as Tesco and Debenhams. Perhaps most importantly, shares in Sports Direct are now worth less than a third of the 922p peak hit in 2014. The lack of a permanent finance director is a farce and another damning indictment of Hellawell. Bob Mellors stepped down in December 2013 for health reasons, but Sports Direct is yet to appoint a permanent replacement, with Matt Pearson filling the role on an interim basis. The company held its last board evaluation in 2014, but did not publish the findings or make notable changes as a result. That cannot be the case this time. It must revitalise its board. It should replace Hellawell and appoint a permanent finance director. It needs to make changes to become a credible investment proposition in the eyes of City institutions, but also to protect the thousands of employees who work for the company. Ashley has pledged to publish the results of an investigation into Sport Direct\u2019s working practices and to make improvements. A strong chairman would ensure this happened. Asda takes sensible route in face of ongoing sales downturn The sharp downturn in Asda\u2019s sales shows how quickly momentum can change in the supermarket industry. Less than three years ago, Asda was the first of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket chains to react to the rise of the discounters Aldi and Lidl, revealing plans to cut prices by \u00a31bn over the next few years. It was the best-performing major supermarket chain in the country ahead of Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. Now it has reported a 7.5% drop in like-for-like sales for the last three months, its worst-ever quarterly performance and the eighth consecutive drop in quarterly sales. Since Asda made its move in 2013, Tesco, Sainbury\u2019s and Morrisons have all responded, while Aldi and Lidl continue to expand rapidly, the Co-op has revitalised its stores, and Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer remain strong upmarket competitors. Asda\u2019s sales have fallen victim to the desire of its US parent company, Walmart, to protect profits in the UK. This has made it vulnerable to aggressive moves from its rivals. The ousting of Asda\u2019s boss Andy Clarke earlier this year suggested that Walmart wanted improvements, but new boy Sean Clarke is unlikely to make dramatic change and launch a new price war. Instead, the strategy will be \u201cfocused on improving the retail basics\u201d, according to Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive. This basically means Asda will focus on keeping its shelves full and costs under control. This is not the drastic response you might expect to a 7.5% fall in sales, but it is sensible. The leading grocery retailers need to move away from their obsession with market share and like-for-like sales, which excludes newly opened or closed stores. Now that the \u201cbig four\u201d are more focused on closing stores than opening them, it is inevitable they will lose market share as the discounters open new outlets across the country and customers buy more on the internet. It is important that the supermarkets remain competitive on price and quality, but a race to the bottom with more steep price cuts would be ruinous and make stores unviable. The \u201cbig four\u201d are already struggling to make their largest stores profitable. It will take years to repair the damage done by opening too many stores, and cutting prices will not solve the underlying problems. Asda and its rivals have a long battle ahead, and there is no easy answer.",

It was the best-performing major supermarket chain in the country ahead of Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons.</p> <p>Now it has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/18/walmart-asda-rejects-price-war-after-eighth-quarter-of-decline\">reported a 7.5% drop in like-for-like sales</a> for the last three months, its worst-ever quarterly performance and the eighth consecutive drop in quarterly sales.</p> <p>Since Asda made its move in 2013, Tesco, Sainbury\u2019s and Morrisons have all responded, while Aldi and Lidl continue to expand rapidly, the Co-op has revitalised its stores, and Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer remain strong upmarket competitors.</p> <p>Asda\u2019s sales have fallen victim to the desire of its US parent company, Walmart, to protect profits in the UK. This has made it vulnerable to aggressive moves from its rivals.</p> <p>The ousting of Asda\u2019s boss Andy Clarke earlier this year suggested that Walmart wanted improvements, but new boy Sean Clarke is unlikely to make dramatic change and launch a new price war. Instead, the strategy will be \u201cfocused on improving the retail basics\u201d, according to Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive. This basically means Asda will focus on keeping its shelves full and costs under control.</p> <p>This is not the drastic response you might expect to a 7.5% fall in sales, but it is sensible. The leading grocery retailers need to move away from their obsession with market share and like-for-like sales, which excludes newly opened or closed stores. Now that the \u201cbig four\u201d are more focused on closing stores than opening them, it is inevitable they will lose market share as the discounters open new outlets across the country and customers buy more on the internet. </p> <p>It is important that the supermarkets remain competitive on price and quality, but a race to the bottom with more steep price cuts would be ruinous and make stores unviable.</p> <p>The \u201cbig four\u201d are already struggling to make their largest stores profitable. It will take years to repair the damage done by opening too many stores, and cutting prices will not solve the underlying problems. Asda and its rivals have a long battle ahead, and there is no easy answer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s obsession with property has sent the country\u2019s net worth soaring to an estimated \u00a38.8tn, an increase of 6% (\u00a3493bn) compared with the end of 2014. A surge in house prices in 2015 offset the UK\u2019s decline in savings, the slow recovery of the banking sector and the government\u2019s growing debt mountain. Overall, house prices increased by 7% in 2015 to add a further \u00a3355bn to the already huge value locked up in Britain\u2019s homes. The Office for National Statistics said in its annual assessment of Britain\u2019s assets and liabilities that the value of dwellings was estimated at \u00a35.5tn at the end of 2015, more than four times their estimated value in 1995, when the figure touched \u00a31.2tn. A more recent survey of house prices for June puts the growth rate at 8.7%. Such is the stellar rise in property prices that the figure for the UK\u2019s total net worth more than tripled between 1995 and 2015, an increase of \u00a36tn, equivalent to an average increase of \u00a387,000 per person, said the ONS. Factories and office blocks add a further \u00a32tn to the value of UK property. The boost to property contrasts with the state of the country\u2019s more liquid financial assets, such as shareholdings, employee stock options, savings and pensions. The financial holdings of British households and companies are vast, but overshadowed by the borrowing and the liabilities attached to the assets. So while private pension funds have accumulated billions of pounds in assets, these are weighed down by the demands on them from current and future pensioners, more than cancelling them out. The state balance sheet makes up another slice of the UK\u2019s assets and in 1995, central government could boast that its assets and liabilities were in balance, but the growing cost of pensioner benefits and the financial crash have thrown red ink all this benign picture and created a \u00a31.5tn deficit. Part of the financial cost of the 2008 banking collapse was the money ministers spent bailing out financial institutions, which were burdened by bad property loans, and the property industry itself. Bankruptcies were avoided and many jobs saved, but at a huge cost to the taxpayer. In contrast to the US, where many banks and property developers were allowed to go bust, in effect writing off the bad loans, UK banks and property companies were bailed out. The effect was that a short sharp fall in property values in 2008 was transformed into a boom that has lasted from 2012 to the present. The ONS figures show that the growth of UK\u2019s property and fixed asset values outstripped that of all other G7 countries while Britain\u2019s total financial assets \u2013 collecting together the financial assets of households, the government and companies - put in the worst performance in the G7. Japan had the highest financial net worth in the G7 at \u00a31.9tn while the UK and Italy had the lowest, both at minus \u00a30.3tn.",

It will be the company\u2019s 13th fulfilment centre in the UK, where Amazon employs a total of 15,500 people. The warehouse is scheduled to open in Tilbury in the spring and will increase delivery capacity. \u201cAmazon is increasing the size of its UK fulfilment centre network to meet increasing customer demand, expand its product selection of more than 150m items and support the needs of a growing number of independent small businesses selling on Amazon Marketplace,\u201d it said. The Tilbury warehouse will be equipped with Amazon\u2019s robotics technology, aimed at facilitating greater product selection and speeding up delivery. Product shelves move to the worker selecting items for delivery, and not the other way round, making the process quicker. The robots slide under a tower of shelves where products are stocked, lift them and move them through the centre. Amazon said the technology also saved space, allowing for 50% more items to be stowed per square foot. John Tagawa, vice president of UK operations, said: \u201cThe Amazon teams are dedicated to innovating in our fulfilment centres to increase speed of delivery while enabling greater selection at lower costs for our customers. \u201cThe introduction of Amazon Robotics is the newest example of our commitment to invention in logistics on behalf of our employees and our customers.\u201d This month the online retailer announced it would open a new centre in Doncaster next summer with the creation of 500 permanent jobs. The jobs at Doncaster and Tilbury are in addition to the 3,500 permanent roles being created by Amazon in the UK in 2016. These include head office roles, customer services jobs, warehouse pickers, and employees at the company\u2019s research and development centres. It is creating jobs at a faster-than-planned rate this year as it rolls out its one-hour delivery operation and extends its web services. Amazon said it was encouraged by the response to its food delivery service, Amazon Fresh, which launched in the UK last month, but has not commented on any expansion plans. Amazon said it would be looking to fill a variety of roles at Tilbury including pickers, operations managers, engineers and IT and human resources workers.",

      "bodyText": "As it\u2019s quietened down, sit back and enjoy this video of retail magnate Sir Philip Green swapping bon mots with Sky News.... Here\u2019s the full story: The latest US unemployment report is as impressive as ever. Just 262,000 people filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, 4,000 fewer than the previous week. That means the initial jobless claims total has been below 300,000 for 76 weeks in a row, which hasn\u2019t happened since 1973. The UK public have shaken off some of their post-referendum worries, according to IPSOS Mori, the polling company. Its latest survey has found that 43% of the public expect the economy to deteriorate over the next 12 months, down from 57% a month ago. And the proportion expecting conditions to improve has risen to 28%, from 23%. Conservative voters have become particularly optimistic this month, apparently, perhaps showing they\u2019re happy with Theresa May\u2019s premiership. But remain supporters, young people and Labour voters are all still gloomy, according to IPSOS Mori\u2019s Gideon Skinner: The European Central Bank has urged EU leaders to pick up their game following Britain\u2019s EU referendum. The minutes of its last meeting, released today, state that: \u201cA strong call was made for European policymakers to contain political uncertainty surrounding the UK exit negotiations and to provide a clear vision for the future path of the European Union and its integration process.\u201d The ECB also hinted that it might deploy fresh stimulus measures at its September meeting, once policymakers had assessed the situation in the eurozone. The minutes of July\u2019s meeting say: \u201cIt was widely felt among members that it was premature tod iscuss any possible monetary policy reaction at this stage. More time was needed to assess the incoming information over the coming months, although downside risks had clearly increased.\u201d Asda\u2019s record fall in sales shows that the company needs to compete better on price, and quality, to stay afloat, says Paul Thomas, senior consultant at Retail Remedy. The limping Asda ship has a new captain and for Sean Clarke\u2019s first trading update, it could be no worse. It is too soon for the new CEO to have had any significant impact but a 7.5% decline in like for like sales is apocalyptic for Asda. There is absolutely no honeymoon period for Sean Clarke: it\u2019s a case of get in there and power up the defibrillator. Back to this morning\u2019s UK retail sales figures, and this chart shows how shoppers have benefitted from falling prices since mid 2014. The weaker pound could end this trend, though, by pushing up import costs.... Some aghast reaction to ASDA\u2019s sales slump: Ouch. In fact. double-ouch. Sales at ASDA, the supermarket chain owned by US mega-group Walmart, have fallen by 7.5% in the last quarter - its worst performance ever! Walmart says it is urgently addressing the situation, but admits turning Asda around will take time given the \u201ccompetitive environment in the UK\u201d, and food deflation. Back in June, Walmart surprise retail experts by parachuting the head of its Chinese operation, Sean Clarke, to run Asda. Like all UK supermarkets, Asda has been squeezed by the rise of discount chains such as Aldi and Lidl. It is also struggling to cope with the shift towards online shopping, and the move away from large supermarkets towards smaller convenience stores. Newsflash: Sports Direct has announced plans to review its own board. The retail chain, whose working practices were exposed by the Guardian last December, has also told the City that its own internal review will be published early next month. Here\u2019s the statement: Sports Direct announces that the independent report on working practices being undertaken by the law firm RPC, which will review and report on the internal investigation announced in December 2015, will be published in the week commencing 5 September 2016, (ahead of the AGM on 7 September 2016). An external evaluation of the board is planned for later this financial year. In other retail news, Amazon has just announced is is opening a new fulfilment centre in Tilbury, Essex next year. This will create 1,500 new permanent jobs, but Amazon will also be deploying its latest Robotics technology, which means.... The robots slide under a tower of shelves where products are stowed, lift it and move it through the fulfilment centre. Robots help speed order processing time and reduce walking time by moving the shelves to employees, reducing the time taken to stow items for sale or pick them for new customer orders. They also save space, allowing for 50 per cent more items to be stowed per square foot. Here\u2019s a recent feature about Amazon\u2019s smart robot work: The jump in the pound suggests investors have been too gloomy about the UK since the Brexit vote, says Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank. Perhaps July\u2019s solid retail sales are a once-off and the positive effects of the weaker pound will be short-lived. However, one thing is certain: the market has been overly pessimistic in the wake of the Brexit vote and clearly needs to better assess the lay of the land. It appears that Britain\u2019s shopkeepers are benefitting from a flurry of tourists, thanks to the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote Joe Grice, Chief Economic Adviser at the Office for National Statistics, explains: \u201cThese are strong numbers showing a pronounced increase in sales compared with last July. Better weather this year could be a major factor with sales of clothing and footwear doing particularly well. There is also anecdotal evidence from respondents suggesting the weaker pound has encouraged overseas visitors to spend. Department stores and specialist retailers like jewellers are among those reporting a good month.\u201d Sterling is rocketing higher, as fears of a Brexit-induced recession ease. The pound has jumped by over one cent against the US dollar to $1.3154, a two week-high, as traders hail the 1.4% jump in retail sales last month. It\u2019s also up 0.8 eurocents at \u20ac1.1631, bouncing back from Tuesday\u2019s three-year low. Andy Scott, economist at HiFX, says British consumers appear to be \u201cunfazed\u201d by the Brexit vote. That could mean the UK avoids falling into recession, as some economists had feared. Scott says: Sentiment is key to avoiding a prolonged downturn or recession and the consumers willingness to spend would point to it holding up well. This chart shows exactly how British retail sales surged by 5.9% year-on-year in July (note how prices fell across the sector) City experts are hailing the surprise rise in UK retail sales in July. Joshua Mahony of IG points out that it follows yesterday\u2019s decent unemployment figures. It may mean the economy actually keeps growing this quarter, despite Brexit uncertainty, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Jeremy Cook of currency exchange firm World First reckons consumers could play a big role in keeping the economy moving: But economist Rupert Seggins remans cautious: No immediate sign of a Brexit shock here.... Every part of the UK retail sector enjoyed growth last month, with non-food stores doing particularly well. And consumers benefitted from cheaper prices in July. The ONS explains: Compared with June 2016, the quantity bought increased by 1.4%; all sectors showed growth with the main contribution again coming from non-food stores. Average store prices (including petrol stations) fell by 2.0% in July 2016 compared with July 2015. Compared with June 2016, there was a fall of 0.8%. BOOM! UK retail sales have soared in July, despite the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Retail sales jumped by 1.4% month-on-month, smashing expectations of a rise of just 0.1% to 0.2%. If you strip out fuel sales, retail sales were 1.5% higher. And on an annual basis, retail sales were almost 6% higher than in July 2015. It\u2019s still early days, but it does suggests that consumers aren\u2019t gripped by post-referendum angst. The Office for National Statistics says that retailers benefitted from warm weather in July, as Brits finally their wardrobes with summery clothing. And the slump in the pound may also have helped, by encouraging overseas visitors to come to the UK. More to follow.... As retail analyst Mark Brumby points out, retail spending isn\u2019t the best route to economic prosperity (especially given Britain\u2019s current account deficit!): Kingfisher, which owns the B&amp;Q do-it-yourself chain, is a decent barometer of the UK retail world. So investors are encouraged to see that it posted a 3% jump in sales over the last quarter. CEO V\u00e9ronique Laury told shareholders that the EU referendum vote has created uncertainty, but: \u201cThere has been no clear evidence of an impact on demand so far on our businesses.\u201d Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, reckons Kingfisher might actually profit from a slowdown in the housing market: Brexit uncertainty, which looks to have cooled the UK property market, may actually be helping as homeowners improve rather than move. Moving home costs money and people may be more inclined to sit tight, perhaps re-mortgage to a lower rate, and carry out home improvements. European stock markets are starting the day with a gentle rally, as fears of an imminent US interest rate hike recede. The FTSE 100 index has risen by 24 points, or 0.35%, to 6883, which recovers most of yesterday\u2019s losses. Mining shares are leading the risers, with Antofagasta and BHP Billiton jumping by 2.5%. The markets in Spain, Italy, Germany and France have all risen by around 0.7%. Last nights dovish minutes from the Federal Reserve are the main factor, with traders anticipating that US interest rates won\u2019t rise in September. Reading the tealeaves in today\u2019s retail sales figures may be tricky, warn economists at RBC Capital Markets. They write: In the UK this morning brings news of retail sales in July. Given it is the first month of data following the referendum result, there will be interest from those trying to discern how the consumer has behaved in the aftermath of the surprise result. However, this isn\u2019t the easiest series to interpret in terms of the read across to broader macro aggregates. Quelle surprise! France\u2019s unemployment rate has hit its lowest level since 2012. In a boost to embattled president Francois Hollande, the French jobless rate has dipped to 9.9% in the second quarter of 2016. That\u2019s the lowest level since the third quarter of 2012, shortly after the socialist leader was sworn in as president (and promptly saw his plane struck by lightning as he flew to meet Angela Merkel). France\u2019s persistently high unemployment rate has dogged Hollande\u2019s presidency; he had pledged to bring it down, but instead the jobless total has hit a series of record highs. And even at 9.9%, France\u2019s unemployment rate is basically double that of the UK or America. So there\u2019s still lots of work for Hollande, or his successor, to do, as Reuters explains: Unemployment was down in all age categories, but the fall in youth unemployment was sharper: it fell 0.4 points to 24.3%, the lowest since 2014. The percentage of long-term unemployed -- those registered as out of work for over a year -- remained stable at 4.3%, however. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Once dubbed a nation of shopkeepers, Modern Britain now looks more like a nation of shoppers. And today we get our first official signal of how June\u2019s Brexit vote has hit consumers. July\u2019s retail sales figures, due at 9.30am, will show whether shopping habits took a knock in the weeks after Britain voted to leave the EU. Economists predict that retail sales crept up by just 0.1% during the month, which would mean sales were 3.9% higher than a year ago. In June, retail sales fell by 0.9% \u2013 the biggest decline in six months \u2013 so the City is hoping for a recovery in July. A poor reading could show that the Brexit vote is eroding confidence, while a decent report might reassure policymakers that Brits are taking the situation in their stride. Yesterday\u2019s unemployment figures didn\u2019t show much impact from the vote, with Britain\u2019s jobless rate remaining at just 4.9%. But it\u2019s not all rosy out there. Pollsters at TMS reported that the British public\u2019s confidence in the economy has fallen sharply since the vote to leave the European Union. TMS found that 33% of Britons think the economy has worsened compared with a year ago, up 11 points from April. Also coming up today.... Investors are still digesting the minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting, which were released last night. They show that the Fed was split over the prospects of an early interest rate hike. That\u2019s likely to push shares higher in Europe today. They\u2019re also watching the Japanese yen nervously, as it bobs a In the corporate world, the Co-operative Bank and retail group Kingfisher are publishing results this morning, with US retail giant Wal-Mart around lunchtime. And in the eurozone, we\u2019re getting French unemployment figures, and eurozone inflation.",

      "bodyText": "Asda has said it will not be increasing its investment in a price cuts regime despite a further 7.5% slump in sales in the spring. On Thursday, the Walmart-owned chain revealed the drop in sales at established stores for the three months to 30 June \u2013 a major worsening of performance after a 5.7% fall in the previous three months and its eighth quarter of decline. One retail analyst described the grocer\u2019s performance as \u201cfairly calamitous\u201d. Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, Brett Biggs, admitted Asda had failed to win back customers from rivals. \u201cIn the UK, fierce competition and food deflation continue to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic,\u201d he said. But despite suggestions that Asda would try to win back shoppers from the likes of Aldi and Lidl with aggressive price cuts, Biggs said the company remained \u201ccommitted to the previously announced five-year \u00a31.5bn price investment\u201d. \u201cOur strategy remains focused on improving retail basics, simplifying and strengthening the offer through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs through our cost analytics programme and driving sales through strategic price investments,\u201d he said. Neil Saunders, chief executive of industry analyst Conlumino, said: \u201cIn our view this is a fairly calamitous outcome and one that certainly reflects the challenges of the UK market, but also underlines the inadequacy of Asda\u2019s response to it.\u201d He said Walmart needed to invest more in price cuts as its traditional low price image had been blunted by heavy competition from Aldi and Lidl. \u201cWalmart, as the biggest retailer in the world, has the firepower and expertise to fight back, but up until now it has been a sleeping giant. These figures will act as a wake up call and that position will, in our view, now change,\u201d he said. But Clive Black, a food retail analyst at broker Shore Capital, said Asda\u2019s problems were not just about price and it was no surprise that the company was not planning to hit the \u201cnuclear button\u201d on a price war. \u201cAsda has got a stronger price perception and relation than a lot of its competitors and it is still underperforming. They have to look at a whole lot more. Their stores are boring and functional and they have lost the art of selling. Product quality is poor and reflects elements of their supply chain and low staff morale.\u201d Asda has been losing market share for the past two years as Aldi and Lidl expanded rapidly, while bigger rival Tesco has improved its prices and service. Price deflation and the rise of online shopping, combined with the use of small local grocery stores, have driven sales declines at all the major traditional supermarket chains. But Asda, which does not operate a chain of small local stores and has based its marketing around price, is faring far worse than its major rivals. The group ousted Andy Clarke from his role as chief executive in June and replaced him with Sean Clarke, a former Asda employee who most recently ran Walmart\u2019s Chinese business. Sean Clarke said: \u201cAlthough Asda is in midst of a very challenging period there is no doubt in my mind that the culture that has always been at the heart of our success is still there. We\u2019ve also started one of the biggest journeys of reinvention in our history to further build on our strong offer and I feel positive about the future.\u201d Asda recruited Roger Burnley, Sainsbury\u2019s operations head, last October and some analysts expected him to replace Clarke once his year-long notice period from Sainsbury\u2019s was over. Burnley will become deputy chief executive when he arrives in October. Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said: \u201cWhile our turnaround will take time, I\u2019m confident in the new leadership team there and want to assure you we\u2019re addressing this with urgency.\u201d In the US, Walmart revealed a better than expected 1.4% rise in sales at established stores, excluding fuel, while total sales for the group rose 0.1% to $119.4bn in the three months to 31 July. The company lifted its profit expectations for the year as it revealed a 1.6% rise in operating profit to $6.2bn. Asda said its US operation had performed well because it had improved its stores, online operation andits prices.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has commissioned an external evaluation of its board of directors, following criticism of the retailer\u2019s corporate governance. In a stock market statement on Thursday, the company also said it would publish a report into how it treats its workers before the annual shareholder meeting next month. Mike Ashley\u2019s retail group, which is facing a shareholder revolt over the re-appointment of its chairman, Keith Hellawell, at the meeting on 7 September, said it was planning an external evaluation of its board of directors by next April. More than 28% of independent shareholders did not back Hellawell at last year\u2019s annual meeting, including the well-respected Standard Life. New rules mean he must now win their support, rather than relying on the vote of Ashley, the company\u2019s founder who owns a 55% stake. The promise of more boardroom scrutiny comes after several large shareholders told the Guardian they planned to vote against Hellawell\u2019s reappointment. Ahead of this year\u2019s vote, shareholder representative group Manifest flagged that Sports Direct had not disclosed the outcome or the process of its last external evaluation, carried out in 2014. The UK corporate governance code recommends that all listed companies have such an external valuation every three years. In a long list of issues with Sports Direct\u2019s corporate governance, Manifest also noted that Sports Direct\u2019s board was not consistent with the code, which recommends at least half of non-executives are independent. Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cSports Direct has a mountain to climb in rebuilding its reputation. Conducting an external board evaluation, and publishing the results, would be a welcome first step. This can\u2019t be just be a cosmetic exercise \u2013 the board must act upon the recommendations of the review. \u201cMike Ashley admitted to a committee of MPs that the company had perhaps grown too big for him to manage, and there is clearly a need to make sure the governance structure is providing independent challenge to management decisions.\u201d Sports Direct has come under increasing pressure to reform its working practices and corporate governance as its sales performance and share price have suffered following damning revelations about its treatment of store and warehouse workers. The company said it would be publishing an independent report on working practices put together by its lawyers, RPC. It said the report would review and report on an internal investigation announced by Sports Direct last December after the Guardian\u2019s revelations about treatment of staff at its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. On 7 September, shareholders are set to vote on a resolution put forward by the Unite union, calling for an independent review of \u201chuman capital management\u201d including the living wage, safe and secure working, guaranteed hours and trade union representation. Sports Direct\u2019s board has recommended that shareholders vote against the resolution as it was \u201cduplicative of current and ongoing efforts of a similar nature\u201d. But earlier this week, Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse workers were awarded \u00a31m in back pay after the retailer admitted it had broken the law in not paying the legal minimum wage. The sportswear chain and its employment agencies are also facing fines of up to \u00a32m imposed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy after they were found to have been underpaying some of the UK\u2019s lowest-paid workers for four years. The payment was agreed between the Unite union, the retailer and HM Revenue &amp; Customs, and includes about 200 workers directly employed by Sports Direct and about 3,000 staff hired through temporary employment agencies. In June, Ashley admitted his company had broken the law by failing to pay staff the national minimum wage. The admission, made when he appeared before MPs investigating his company\u2019s treatment of its workers, confirmed the findings of the Guardian\u2019s investigation, which revealed that Shirebrook warehouse staff were required to go through searches at the end of each shift, during which their time was unpaid. They also suffered deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift a minute late. HMRC is also investigating whether Sports Direct has been paying the minimum wage to the 13,000 workers at its stores. Ashley claimed he was struggling to cope with the scale of Sports Direct when he appeared before MPs, and his board had been criticised for lacking independent directors. The company is also lacking a permanent finance director having appointed Matt Pearson as acting finance officer last summer. Pressure for change has increased after the Financial Conduct Authority, the financial watchdog, required minority investors to approve non-executive directors at companies where a single shareholder owns 30% or more. The rules came into force in May 2014 but did not affect Sports Direct\u2019s last annual shareholder meeting because companies were given six months to comply.",

The first official insight into consumer behaviour following the 23 June poll indicated that sales rose by 1.4% in July after a 0.9% drop in June, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It was much stronger than the 0.2% increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll but echoed industry reports of solid growth in consumer spending last month. It is the latest evidence that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU has had a limited impact on the UK economy in the immediate aftermath of the vote and will soothe fears of a recession later this year. But economists were quick to warn that the prospect of job cuts and of rising prices on the high street could see retailers\u2019 fortunes change. The news of rising retail sales follows jobs figures on Wednesday suggesting that while business sentiment has been hit, employers are not making any sudden decisions to lay off staff. The number of people claiming unemployment benefit dropped by 8,600 in July, surprising economists who were expecting a rise of 9,500. According to the ONS there were signs that the fall in the pound since the referendum, which has made holidaying in the UK cheaper for overseas visitors, had attracted tourists on shopping sprees for luxury goods. Sales of watches and jewellery were up 16.6% on the year. Joe Grice, the chief economic adviser at the ONS, said: \u201cThese are strong numbers showing a pronounced increase in sales compared with last July. Better weather this year could be a major factor with sales of clothing and footwear doing particularly well. There is also anecdotal evidence from respondents suggesting the weaker pound has encouraged overseas visitors to spend. Department stores and specialist retailers like jewellers are among those reporting a good month.\u201d Retail sales volumes were up 5.9% on the same period a year ago as all sectors recorded growth with the main contribution coming from non-food stores, the ONS said. Against the backdrop of stiff competition between supermarkets and widespread discounting, average store prices were down 2% on a year ago in July. But the big rise in sales volumes meant there was still a rise in the amount spent \u2013 of 3.6% on the year. The amount spent online increased by 16.7% compared with July 2015. A spokesperson for the business group CBI, which strongly supported a vote to stay in the EU, said the outlook was still uncertain for retailers. \u201cLooking ahead, we can expect weaker spending. The recent fall in the pound will push up the cost of everyday purchases over the coming year, which will eat into households\u2019 spending power,\u201d said Anna Leach, CBI\u2019s head of economic analysis. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, echoed that. \u201cJuly\u2019s retail sales figures show that consumers have been protected from the immediate fallout of the Brexit vote, but with firms intending to stop hiring and inflation set to soar, the high street is set for a tough year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real test for consumer spending lies in 2017 when jobs cuts will kick in and inflation will erode spending power.\u201d But other commentators said there was little reason to fear a Brexit-related blow to retailers in the near term given spending is being supported by low inflation, low interest rates and low unemployment. Ian Geddes, the UK head of retail at consultants Deloitte, said: \u201cRetailers will be buoyed by the news of steady confidence and increased spending, and the industry as a whole should feel optimistic about the second half of the year, which will be seen as a period of calm before the Brexit process begins. \u201cBetween now and Christmas, consumers\u2019 spending habits are unlikely to change dramatically, and retailers have an opportunity to make hay while the sun shines.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank warned that the economic impact of the Brexit vote was a threat to its recovery plans as the troubled lender revealed a narrowed first-half loss of \u00a3177m. The bank said the uncertain economic backdrop was depleting its capital reserves \u2013 a key cushion against financial instability. It warned that the potential for higher unemployment and falling house prices in the aftermath of the EU referendum could also damage its prospects. Losses before tax narrowed in the first half of the year to \u00a3177m from \u00a3204m in the same period last year, but the bank\u2019s chief executive, Niall Booker, warned it was still facing considerable challenges. \u201cAddressing the bank\u2019s historic legacy issues will continue to impact our overall financial performance until the end of our plan period. While losses have reduced year on year, the potential for headwinds in the economy as a whole presents further challenges,\u201d he said. Booker said all high street lenders faced a challenge from the referendum\u2019s consequences, including the Bank of England\u2019s decision to cut interest rates to 0.25%, which makes it harder for banks to generate profits. \u201cToday\u2019s market conditions are challenging for all retail-focused banks and the macroeconomic uncertainty following the result of the EU referendum, including the likelihood of lower for longer interest rates, may restrict our ability to grow revenue in the short term,\u201d he said. The bank is midway through a five-year turnaround plan and has been cutting jobs in an effort to lower costs. It closed 54 bank branches in the first half of 2016 as customers increasingly prefer to do transactions online or by telephone. A further five closures are planned during the second half of the year, leaving the Co-op Bank with 105 branches. It nearly collapsed in 2013 after losses from bad debts on commercial property opened up a \u00a31.5bn hole in its finances. Bondholders took control of the bank, turning its longstanding owner, the Co-operative Group, into a minority shareholder. Its financial woes were compounded by revelations that its former chairman, Paul Flowers, took class A drugs. The bank\u2019s core tier one ratio \u2013 the main measure of the cushion of capital that a bank holds \u2013 fell to 13.4% at the end of June from 15.5% at the end of 2015 as losses eroded its capital pile. Losses in the first half were lessened by a one-off \u00a358m gain from the sale of the bank\u2019s share in Visa Europe. The Co-operative Group is still the largest shareholder in the bank, with a 20% stake. Its biggest institutional investors are the US hedge funds Silver Point Capital, GoldenTree Asset Management, and Perry Capital. The group has taken up its right to appoint a non-executive to the bank\u2019s board, with Alistair Asher taking on the role from 12 September. The bank confirmed that its deputy chief executive, Liam Coleman, would replace Booker in the top job at the end of year. Dennis Holt, the bank\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cFollowing the appointment of Liam Coleman as deputy chief executive on 3 May 2016, I am pleased to confirm that Liam will succeed Niall Booker as chief executive, subject to regulatory approval, when Niall\u2019s contract with the bank expires on 31 December 2016 following a planned handover during the fourth quarter of 2016.\u201d The number of current accounts held at the bank fell to 1.422m at the end of June, from 1.43m a year earlier. Booker said that although the economic outlook was more uncertain following the vote to leave the EU, there had been no noticeable drop in the number of people applying for a mortgage. He said it was impossible to put a number on what the Brexit vote might mean for the future profitability of the bank because it was \u201cstill too murky\u201d.",

The dollar rose strongly to US77.13c, up from 76.72c on Wednesday, in a sign of renewed market confidence in the Australian economy. But the headline unemployment figure of 5.72% \u2013 the lowest in almost three years \u2013 masked the growing trend towards part-time working as the economy transitions from the investment-driven mining boom to a service-focused base. Full-time employment actually fell by 45,400 jobs in July, while the number of part-time jobs was up by 71,600. The participation rate, which refers to the number of people either employed or actively looking for work, was flat at 64.9%. The data also shows that 72,000 new jobs were created in the first seven months of 2016, compared with more than 150,000 in the same period last year. Full-time job creation has gone into reverse in that time by almost 65,000 compared with jobs growth of almost 90,000 in the same period last year. Savanth Sebastian, an economist at CommSec, also noted a slowdown in new jobs being advertised earlier this year, adding that the uncertainty caused by the lengthy federal election campaign could have had a dampening effect on hiring. \u201cThe softer results across the labour market mirror other indicators across the economy, including retail sales,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the sluggish first half of 2016 resulted in employers managing their major cost base (employees) more carefully. \u201cThe hope would be that now the election is out of the way consumers and businesses will go back to spending, investing and hiring \u2013 particularly given the ultra-low interest rates on offer and significant improvements in the household budget.\u201d In Western Australia, where the jobless rate of 6.3% is the second highest in the country behind South Australia, employment minister Michaelia Cash tried to put some positive spin on the growth in part-time jobs. \u201cI\u2019m not going to demonise part-time employment.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Earlier this week it was reported that Commonwealth Bank CEO Ian Narev\u2019s total pay for the past year rose to $12.3m \u2013 an increase of 50%. Narev\u2019s pay rise comes at a time when Australian workers are receiving the lowest growth in their wages ever recorded. Yesterday the ABS revealed that in the past year, wages in the private sector grew by just 1.9% in trend terms \u2013 marking four years of falling wages growth. As workers sit watching the Olympics at night they probably don\u2019t feel like record breakers, but they are. Australian wages are rising by record low amounts \u2013 both in the private and public sectors. Total Australia wages growth, excluding bonuses, grew by just 2.1% in the past year \u2013 both in trend and seasonally adjusted terms. By either measure it was a record: And it is a record that places some pressure on the budget figures. This year\u2019s May budget estimated that the annual financial year wages growth for 2015-16 would be 2.25%. While the over-estimation in the budget for last financial year shouldn\u2019t have too big of an impact on income tax revenue (lower than expected wages growth = lower than expected income tax revenue), the budget estimated wages in 2016-17 would grow by 2.5% and by 2.75% in 2017-18. The last time wages grew above 2.75% was in 2013, and there is very little sense that a turnaround is about to occur that would see wages growth return to those levels. As a general rule public sector wages tend to rise faster than the private sector, but even the public sector is experiencing record low wages growth. On the private sector side however, the picture is very grim. Annual wages growth has fallen every quarter since June 2012 \u2013 four years of wages growing ever slower: The quarterly wages growth shows no signs of life either. In June, private sector wages grew by just 0.41% in trend terms \u2013 a low beaten only by the GFC quarter of September 2009. The difference is that back then when for one quarter private sector wages grew by just 0.39%, it was followed by growth of 0.7%; by contrast the latest weak growth figure comes off the back of five consecutive quarters of 0.5% or lower growth: The 0.48% wages growth in the public sector is a new record. The slowing wages growth is being felt across the nation in almost all industries. Only in the retail trade; transport, postal and warehousing; and other services industries is annual wages growth higher now than it was a year ago. And in some industries, such as mining, and financial and insurance, the drop in wage growth has been severe \u2013 by more than half a percentage point: The big drop-off in wages growth in the financial and insurance industry might be a bit of a surprise given the Commonwealth Bank CEO, Ian Narev\u2019s $4m-plus pay rise. Of course wage rises across industries don\u2019t have a lot to do with actual pay rates. There is not a lot of correlation between wage rises and average earnings \u2013 both mining and the finance and insurance industries remain at the top end of the earnings scale: But while Narev\u2019s pay rise is large, mostly it comes via bonuses with his fixed pay unchanged at $2.65m. The wages price index does not include bonuses in the overall figure, as they are considered less reflective of the actual wage growth of most workers, but the ABS does measure the growth of total pay including bonuses. However even here Narev is very much the exception. While total pay including bonuses can sometime grow faster than \u201cbase wages\u201d, in the last quarter, pay including bonuses did not grow at all. It meant that in the past 12 months, regardless of which measure used, wages grew by record lows \u2013 and at just 1.8%, wages growth including bonuses actually grew by less than the base amount: The ongoing poor wages growth means that real wages continue to stagnate when measured against inflation. As noted last week, real wages growth is better when measured against the employee cost of living index \u2013 due to falling interest rates assisting those with mortgages: But for those without mortgages and those who have not gained the benefits of lower prices of some items within the inflation basket, the picture of real wages growth is pretty bleak. Over the past three years, real wages have grown just 0.3% using the underlying inflation measure of the \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d. Given changes to welfare payment thresholds and some rises in nominal pay which takes people into higher levels of taxation and above certain cut-offs for welfare payments, this means that on average people\u2019s standard of living would have decreased in that time. Falling mortgage rates have certainly assisted many households, but with continuing weak wages growth, the benefits flowing through into overall standard of living appears negligible. And those benefits from lower mortgage repayment are of course dependent upon banks passing on the rate cuts made by the Reserve Bank. It is thus likely to be a more than a little jarring for workers experiencing barely any rise in their income, to recall that the man who just received a 50% pay rise also decided not to pass on the full 25 basis points cut in interest rates to customers. No doubt he\u2019ll explain that decision in front of a parliamentary committee at some point, but I suspect he has $12.3m reasons to not worry too much about it.",

And in some industries, such as mining, and financial and insurance, the drop in wage growth has been severe \u2013 by more than half a percentage point:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual wages growth - 2015 and 2016\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3qwLx/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The big drop-off in wages growth in the financial and insurance industry might be a bit of a surprise given the Commonwealth Bank CEO, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/cba-chief-ian-narev-receives-123m-in-pay-20160815-gqsy6z.html\">Ian Narev\u2019s</a> $4m-plus pay rise.</p> <p>Of course wage rises across industries don\u2019t have a lot to do with actual pay rates. There is not a lot of correlation between wage rises and average earnings \u2013 both mining and the finance and insurance industries remain at the top end of the earnings scale:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wage growth and average earnings\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PyxCS/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while Narev\u2019s pay rise is large, mostly it comes via bonuses with his fixed pay unchanged at $2.65m. </p> <p>The wages price index does not include bonuses in the overall figure, as they are considered less reflective of the actual wage growth of most workers, but the ABS does measure the growth of total pay including bonuses. </p> <p>However even here Narev is very much the exception. While total pay including bonuses can sometime grow faster than \u201cbase wages\u201d, in the last quarter, pay including bonuses did not grow at all. </p> <p>It meant that in the past 12 months, regardless of which measure used, wages grew by record lows \u2013 and at just 1.8%, wages growth including bonuses actually grew by less than the base amount:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wages price index - private sector annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dgLeV/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The ongoing poor wages growth means that real wages continue to stagnate when measured against inflation. As noted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/aug/09/never-had-it-so-good-the-misconceptions-about-the-cost-of-living\">last week</a>, real wages growth is better when measured against the employee cost of living index \u2013 due to falling interest rates assisting those with mortgages: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual real wage growth - deflated by inflation and cost of living\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BCs4U/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But for those without mortgages and those who have not gained the benefits of lower prices of some items within the inflation basket, the picture of real wages growth is pretty bleak. </p> <p>Over the past three years, real wages have grown just 0.3% using the underlying inflation measure of the \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d. </p> <p>Given changes to welfare payment thresholds and some rises in nominal pay which takes people into higher levels of taxation and above certain cut-offs for welfare payments, this means that on average people\u2019s standard of living would have decreased in that time. </p> <p>Falling mortgage rates have certainly assisted many households, but with continuing weak wages growth, the benefits flowing through into overall standard of living appears negligible. </p> <p>And those benefits from lower mortgage repayment are of course dependent upon banks passing on the rate cuts made by the Reserve Bank. </p> <p>It is thus likely to be a more than a little jarring for workers experiencing barely any rise in their income, to recall that the man who just received a 50% pay rise also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/commonwealth-bank-chief-says-not-passing-on-full-interest-rate-cut-helps-savers\">decided not to pass on the full 25 basis points cut</a> in interest rates to customers. </p> <p>No doubt he\u2019ll explain that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/04/shorten-royal-commission-banks-respect-goverment\">decision in front of a parliamentary committee</a> at some point, but I suspect he has $12.3m reasons to not worry too much about it. </p>",
