      "bodyText": "The ousted Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond is facing fresh pressure after the chairman of the House of Commons Treasury select committee described some of his evidence to MPs yesterday as \"implausible\", as the row grew over who was at the heart of manipulation of interest rates during the credit crisis. Andrew Tyrie, who could take charge of a parliamentary inquiry into Britain's banking industry if MPs can reach agreement today, ratcheted up the pressure on Diamond by writing to Barclays over some of his evidence. Hours after Diamond denounced the behaviour of some of his staff as \"reprehensible\", Tyrie said he would be asking Barclays for correspondence from the Financial Services Authority about its assessment of Diamond. Tyrie said: \"I think, cumulatively, the whole package looks somewhat implausible.\" During a three-hour grilling by MPs yesterday Diamond told the treasury select committee of his disgust when he learned that traders at Barclays had manipulated interest rates in 2005. \"When I read the emails from those traders I got physically ill. It is reprehensible behaviour and if you are asking me should those actions be dealt with \u2013 absolutely.\" Asked by the Conservative MP David Ruffley when he learnt of the practice of rate rigging \u2013 known as low balling \u2013 Diamond indicated that he only learnt about it when he was shown the FSA report a few days before its publication. \"The finding of the investigation, other than the things I learnt as a witness, came to me four or five days before they were published.\" Tyrie is concerned that Diamond said he was not aware of the manipulation of the Libor interest rate by Barclays traders between 2005 and 2009. Tyrie asked Diamond whether it was true that the FSA had raised questions about his initial appointment as chief executive of Barclays in the autumn of 2010. Tyrie said he had also been told that the FSA had raised a number of concerns about the bank at a Barclays board meeting in February, which FSA officials attended. A Barclays source said the allegation made by Tyrie about the FSA was selective leaking of highly confidential documents, which misrepresented the meeting. As the pressure on Diamond was renewed yesterday, Chancellor George Osborne ramped up hostilities with Labour over Britain's banking culture, accusing Ed Balls and other Labour former ministers of being \"clearly involved\" in intervening over the Libor rate. The carefully-staged intervention by Osborne, immediately dismissed by Balls's team as \"desperate\" and \"frenzied\", was designed to intensify the pressure on Labour as Ed Miliband tries to establish a judge-led inquiry into the banking scandal. The Labour leader, who clashed with David Cameron in the Commons on Wednesday on the best way to investigate the manipulation of interest rates at Barclays, will table a motion calling for a time-limited inquiry along similar lines to the Leveson inquiry into press ethics. If Miliband's proposal is rejected by MPs, it is expected that Labour will not block the prime minister's plan for a parliamentary inquiry to be chaired by Tyrie. However, Tyrie has said that he will not preside over an inquiry that is not backed by all three parties. If Tyrie feels unable to chair the inquiry, Downing Street is expected to say that the Treasury select committee should simply continue its work. Labour is likely to deflect criticism of a climbdown by arguing that the prime minister, who had initially rejected an inquiry, has changed tack as the scale of the Barclays scandal has unfolded.

There were two significant findings \u2013 that Barclays traders did favours for colleagues (\"submitters\") to submit higher or lower rates to the Libor panel to help generate profits; and that during the 2008 banking crisis they reduced submissions to avoid any suggestion that the bank was in financial difficulty.

So impressive was his defensive display during the hearing before the Treasury select committee \u2013 hurriedly scheduled after the record \u00a3290m fine was slapped on the bank last week \u2013 that towards the end of the testimony one MP compared him to one of England's cricketing heroes. \"Like Geoffrey Boycott you've occupied the crease for two and half hours but I'm not sure we are any the wiser,\" John Thurso told him.

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Sykes, the former chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, has refused to criticise actions at the large pharmaceutical company, saying he had \"not a clue\" about the details of a $3bn settlement with US authorities. But critics said the case, involving issues dating to 1997, underlined the need for tougher action, which could include certain executives being jailed. FairPensions, the campaign for responsible investment, linked the GSK scandal to the firestorm that has engulfed Barclays bank in the past week, and said the controversies were costing the City much more than tougher regulation ever could. Sykes, now chairman of the Royal Institution, and the UK's largest NHS healthcare trust, said the issues concerning the pharmaceutical group, where he had been chairman, were \"complicated\" and he was still digesting the case, despite a corporate statement from GSK more than 36 hours earlier. \"I have not had a chance to read the newspapers and have not a clue as to what is going on,\" he said, from his home in London. \"It is a complicated situation with two different companies [SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome] and they did not really start coming together till 2001.\" Sykes was chief executive of Glaxo before the \u00a3100bn merger in 2000 but then stood down as chairman of the combined GSK in the middle of 2002. A whistleblower, Greg Thorpe, first alerted the company to the entertainment offered doctors and the culture that allegedly put profits above ethics in 2001. Sykes suggested that the problems could have related mainly to SmithKline, prior to its merger with Glaxo. But GSK insisted that the problem was in the US and in the past: \"Since Andrew Witty became chief executive in 2008, GSK has made significant changes at all levels within the company to ensure we act with integrity in everything we do, and these matters do not reflect the company that we are today.\" The company admitted in its settlement with various American authorities that it had been offering lavish holidays and hospitality to targeted doctors and encouraged the prescription of unsuitable anti-depressants to children. GSK also paid for articles to appear in medical journals lauding its products, and hired \"independent\" doctors to promote the treatments. Thorpe raised his concerns with David Stout, who was then head of the US business, and Bob Ingram, GSK's chief operating officer. When he was forced out of the company he took his case to the regulators, who spent almost 10 years investigating the issues. Stout became a non-executive director of another London-listed pharmaceutical company, Shire plc, and Ingram is chairman of the biotech firm Elan Corporation. Louise Rouse, director of engagement at FairPensions, said shareholders should be asking searching questions to ensure there is sufficient oversight of people and practices at the new companies the executives had joined. \"Even though the management has moved on, shareholders at GSK need to ensure that the root and branch reform promised on paper has in fact been carried out,\" she said. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group at the Washington-based campaign group Public Citizen, noted that the latest fine on GSK was just the latest in a series dating back to 1991. He said: \"Until more meaningful penalties and the prospect of jail time for company heads who are responsible for such activity become commonplace, companies will continue defrauding the government and putting patients lives in danger.\"",

He insists he had no idea that his traders were fiddling Libor, even though he was convinced that every other bank was doing it. He insisted he knew no details of the traders' misdemeanours until two weeks ago. Although there had been numerous reports about the issue, he evidently asked no questions. 4 His predecessor, John Varley, has some questions to answer. Diamond regularly suggested that communication between regulators, government and the bank would have been conducted over his head, when the urbane Varley was chief executive. 5 MPs are not the right people to run a wider inquiry into the banking industry. So many wasted opportunities, so many rambling questions, so few supplementary questions. Compared with the Leveson Inquiry's forensic inquisitor Robert Jay, they were rank amateurs. 6 Diamond just loves Barclays bank. We know because he told us so \u2013 over and over again.",

      "bodyText": "Grim news from the services sector is expected to help Sir Mervyn King win over waverers on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee on Thursday and clinch the vote for an extra \u00a350bn of quantitative easing. Four of the nine-member rate-setting committee, including King, voted for more QE last month; but after a downbeat survey suggested the crucial services sector grew at its slowest pace for eight months in June, City analysts are betting that at least one more will join them. The Purchasing Managers' Index for services, which measures the strength of high street shops to management consultants, fell to 51.3 in June from 53.3 in May, against the background of renewed turmoil in the eurozone. \"The services economy saw one of its worst months since the recovery began three years ago, with the June survey showing signs of growth stalling,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the survey. He added that it, \"probably cements the case for further stimulus from the Bank of England.\" The weak reading dashed hopes of a sharp rebound from the double-dip recession, after similar surveys for manufacturing and construction showed sharply declining output. The Bank had already warned that growth in the second quarter of 2012 would be hit by the extra holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee, which saw workers down tools to watch the celebrations. A renewal of QE - buying up government bonds with electronically created money - which has so far been worth \u00a3325bn, has been widely expected since King used his Mansion House speech last month to warn that the economic outlook had deteriorated sharply. The chancellor has also acknowledged the seriousness of the situation by announcing a series of new emergency measures, which will operate alongside QE to try and boost bank lending. The British Chambers of Commerce warns that these schemes might help businesses more than QE, which it fears could push up inflation, if investors use the funds on other assets such as commodities. \"Increasing QE is not risk-free, and could be counter-productive. It may limit the decline in inflation in the long term, at a time when we need falling inflation to underpin real incomes and boost demand in the UK economy,\" said the BCC's chief economist, David Kern. John Zhu, UK economist at HSBC, said the details of Wednesday's survey, as well as the headline reading, gave cause for concern. \"Firms seem to be running down on outstanding work, while incoming new business is slowing sharply. Expectations have dropped markedly from elevated levels seen at the start of the year, and may fall further given the ongoing eurozone crisis and a potential hangover effect once the Olympics are finished. Services companies also told Markit that they had been forced to cut their prices in the face of weak consumer demand, and felt much less optimistic about the prospects for the next 12 months than they had in May. Separate PMI surveys released for the eurozone on Wednesday showed services firms have continued to cut output as the sovereign debt crisis takes its toll on demand. The composite PMI, which measures the strength of services sector across all 17 member countries of the eurozone, registered 46.4 in June, edging up from 46 in May but still suggesting a downturn in the sector. \"Even Germany looks to have fallen into a renewed decline, though only a very modest drop in output is signalled. The pace of downturns in other major euro member states is far more worrying,\" said Williamson. Following a weak reading from the manufacturing survey recently, the PMIs across the eurozone are pointing to a contraction of 0.6% in the region's economy in the second quarter of 2012, and could help spur policymakers at the European Central Bank to cut interest rates from their record low of 1% when they meet on Thursday.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has claimed members of Gordon Brown's circle were \"clearly involved\" in pressurising banks to manipulate the London inter-bank offered rate (Libor) at the height of the financial crisis of 2008. In an interview with the Spectator magazine to be published on Thursday, Osborne raised the political temperature by pointing the finger of blame on members of the former Labour government, mentioning Ed Balls by name as one of those who had \"questions to answer\". His comments follow a note by Diamond that claimed \"senior figures within Whitehall\" had been involved in applying pressure to Barclays to keep the key inter-bank lending rate down during the financial crisis. In a hearing with MPs on Wednesday at which the former Barclays chief executive made a staunch defence of his tenure at the bank, Diamond made it clear that he did not think Paul Tucker, the Bank of England's deputy governor, had given the bank free rein to cut its interest rates during the October 2008 banking crisis. He mentioned two political figures, former City minister Lord Myners and Baroness Vadera, as he was questioned about remarks he attributed to Tucker that Whitehall figures had been concerned about the high bids Barclays had been submitting for Libor and its European equivalent Euribor. But he was careful not to suggest that they were the figures that Tucker might have been referring to. Osborne said in his interview that both the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the US department of justice were \"very clear\" that the Bank of England did not issue instructions to Barclays to cut its Libor rate. \"As for the role of the Labour government and the people around Gordon Brown, well, I think there are questions to be asked of them.\" Singling out Balls, once a city minister but who served as children's secretary under Brown's premiership, he went on: \"My opposite number, who was the City minister for part of this period and Gordon Brown's right-hand man for all of it \u2026 he has questions to answer as well.

      "bodyText": "With Wall Street closed for Independence Day, the rival distraction of Bob Diamond's appearance at the Treasury select committee libor hearing, and some hesitancy ahead of Thursday's expected rate or QE moves from the Bank of England and European Central Bank, markets were in fairly subdued move for much of the day. An exception was engineering group GKN, which traders suggested could be close to sealing a deal to buy the aerospace division of Swedish group Volvo. Shares in the UK group added 3p to 186.6p on talk an agreement could come in the first half of July. Early reports suggested a price of \u00a3800m for the business although a recent poll by Swedish news agency SME Direkt came up with an average price of \u00a3635m and a high of \u00a3770m. Credit Suisse analysts said the deal could be financed mainly with debt, along with a placing to raise 25% of the price, and could add around 3% to 2012 earnings. Overall the FTSE 100 finished down 3.26 points at 5684.47, but there was little real activity. A disappointing set of UK service sector figures did little to inspire enthusiasm ahead of Thursday's central bank decisions. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: Volumes were thin today and the market drifted sideways not only because the US markets were closed for Independence Day, but also because many people were glued to their televisions watching Bob Diamond's testimony to the Treasury Select Committee.

      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond, former boss of Barclays, indicated he was ready to fight for his payoff of up to \u00a322m at a parliamentary hearing. He told the Treasury select committee he \"got physically ill\" when he first read an exchange of emails between the 14 Barclays staff who manipulated interest rates. Diamond used a series of descriptions such as \"reprehensible\", \"bad\" and \"abhorrent\" as he made his first public appearance since resigning from the bank he \"loves\" on Tuesday after 16 years \u2013 and 18 months at the top. The American-born banker \u2013 who has been paid about \u00a3100m since 2006 \u2013 missed an opportunity to quell any controversy about a potential payoff when asked about the need for claw back and giving up share awards after the \u00a3290m fine for rigging rates was announced last week. Labour MP Andrew Love asserted that \"there has to be recognition in that final payoff of what went wrong\". But Diamond insisted \"that is a question for the board\". In a hearing with MPs at which Diamond made a staunch defence of his tenure at Barclays, he made clear that he did not think Paul Tucker, Bank of England deputy governor, had given the bank free rein to cut its interest rates during the October 2008 banking crisis. During the session Diamond mentioned two political figures \u2013 former City minister Lord Myners and Shriti [Baronness] Vedara \u2013 as he was questioned about remarks he attributed to Tucker that Whitehall figures had been concerned about the high rates Barclays had been submitted for two key interest rate benchmarks \u2013 the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and its European equivalent Euribor \u2013 during the crisis. But he was careful not to suggest they were figures that Tucker might have been referring to. Diamond said that \"it was reprehensible,\" when asked about the emails which showed traders boasting \"this is for you big boy\" and offering bottles of Bollinger champagne. He had not seen the emails until the weekend before the fine, which was announced last Wednesday, when was sent the findings of the regulators in the UK and US. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, levelled a series of allegations against Diamond, asking whether it was true that the Financial Services Authority had raised questions about his initial appointment as chief executive of Barclays in the autumn of 2010. Diamond quit on Tuesday in a dramatic 24 hours for the bank, which the day before had said the chairman Marcus Agius would go, as the buck stopped with him. Tyrie said he had also been told that the FSA had raised a number of concerns about the bank at a Barclays board meeting in February when FSA officials attended. In a packed hearing in the Wilson Room, Diamond said he had no knowledge of concerns registered by the FSA at the time of his appointment \u2013 announced in September 2010. Referring to the FSA's attendance at Barclays board meeting in February, Tyrie said: \"Did they tell you that trust had broken down between the FSA and Barclays?\" Diamond insisted this was the not the case but conceded that regulators had previously expressed concern about Protium, the Cayman Islands fund that was set up to manage $12bn (\u00a37.5bn) of its most troublesome assets but is now being unwound. He said Protium was a \"transaction that created more debate between Barclays and the FSA than anyone anticipated\". To avoid a repeat of the incident when Rupert Murdoch appeared before MPs and was hit by a protester, security was tight with heavy police security and sniffer dogs on hand. Diamond explained that he had quit to break the \"bridge\" between him and the bank. \"I love Barclays, that's where it starts,\" said Diamond. He insisted that he did not know if Agius had been contacted by regulators on Monday night to try to force his resignation. The record \u00a3290m fine levied on Barclays was for attempting to manipulate the interest rate benchmarks, supposedly based on the rates at which banks lend to one another \u2013 the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and its European equivalent Euribor between 2005 and 2009. There were two significant findings \u2013 that Barclays traders did favours for colleagues (\"submitters\") to submit higher or lower rates to the Libor panel to help generate profits; and during the 2008 banking crisis they reduced submissions to avoid any suggestion that the bank was in financial difficulty. Barclays released an email written by Diamond recording a conversation with Tucker in October 2008, which has caused some confusion about whether the Bank of England was encouraging Barclays to reduce its submissions to Libor. In a statement barely an hour before Diamond's Tucker took the unusual step of publicly asking to appear before the committee. Diamond insisted again that he did not interpret Tucker's remarks as a signal to shift Libor submissions even when Tyrie said that it looked to anyone reading it like a \"nod and wink\". The sequence of events unleashed by that email, sent in the darkest days of the banking crisis, also forced the departure of Jerry del Missier, who was Diamond's closest colleague at the bank. Del Missier, a Canadian, was promoted to chief operating officer a fortnight ago, but was named as the top executive who instructed more junior staff to lower the bank's submissions to Libor. Diamond was asked why Del Missier had interpreted his email as a licence to cut Libor submissions. He said he did know and had not discussed it with him.",

Diamond ran Barclays Capital, the investment banking arm of the bank, at the time of the offences \u2013 which took place between 2005 and 2009 \u2013 while Del Missier was also a senior figure at BarCap. Diamond was promoted to chief executive in January 2011; Del Missier to chief operating officer only two weeks ago.</p> <p>The memo written by Diamond \u2013 and sent to the then chief executive John Varley and copied to Del Missier \u2013 implied Tucker was receiving pressure from Whitehall figures to tackle Barclays' relatively high interest rates. The identity of those Whitehall figures is not yet clear.</p> <p>Lady Vadera, the economist who advised Gordon Brown and was made a minister, denied that she had spoken to Tucker about Libor rates.</p> <p>She also rejected claims that she authored a Treasury note titled Reducing Libor, but insisted it dealt with entirely legitimate government concerns.</p> <p>\"I did not have a conversation with Paul Tucker about Libor,\" she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.</p> <p>\"I did not have the conversation that is being alleged and I didn't write that note.</p> <p>\"I commented on the note, in particular to focus the issues on the lending conditions in the real economy for real people.\"</p> <p>Asked if anyone in the Labour government had suggested to the Bank of England that the rate should be manipulated, she said: \"I can only speak for myself. I can't obviously speak for everybody in government.</p> <p>\"You asked me if Libor was a concern and of course it was a concern. There is nothing wrong with concerning yourself with access to credit. That's the job.\"</p> <p>But that concern \"cannot be confused or used as an excuse for the actions of traders who choose, for their own reasons and for their own book, to do certain things\", she added.</p> <p>In the Commons the prime minister said it would be \"inexplicable\" and wrong if top bankers who were forced out or quit as a result of scandals received \"a vast payoff\".</p> <p>Amid reports that Diamond could be in line for a payout of up to \u00a322m, Cameron was urged by fellow Conservative Sir Peter Tapsell to ensure \"the delinquents are not able to walk away with their bonuses and severance payments\".</p> <p>Cameron told MPs: \"I think it would be completely wrong if people who were leaving under these circumstances were given some vast payoff. It would be completely inexplicable to the British public and it would not be right, and I very much hope that doesn't happen.\"</p> <p>The prime minister said the government would legislate so that all pay deals were put to shareholders in a binding vote \"and those deals should include any severance payments\".</p> <p>Earlier in the day, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, bemoaned the fact that Diamond would not be \"short of a bob or two\", despite leaving the bank under a cloud.</p> <p>Clegg said: \"I think many people will be dismayed, as he's leaving under a cloud, that he might be paid handsomely, he'll get handsome rewards for having presided over serious wrongdoing.\"</p> <p>While there appeared to be cross-party consensus against payoffs, the deadlock over the nature of the inquiry that should be held into the failures of banking continued as Cameron underlined his preference for a \"swift and decisive\" parliamentary inquiry over Labour's call for a judge-led independent investigation.</p> <p>Ed Miliband told the prime minister across the dispatch box that his reluctance to set up an investigation along the lines of the Leveson inquiry into media practices showed he did not understand the scale of public concern over the banking scandal.</p> <p>The Labour leader used prime minister's question time to set out a proposal for a two-stage inquiry, with an initial investigation into Libor rigging completed by Christmas and then a wider 12-month investigation of the culture and practices of the City.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"The banking scandal of the last week has revealed traders cheating, the mis-selling of insurance products to small businesses and comes on top of other scandals in the banking system and the continuing multimillion bonus merry-go-round.\"</p> <p>He asked the prime minister: \"How can you convince people that a parliamentary inquiry is a better way of restoring people's confidence than a full, independent, forensic and open judge-led inquiry?\"</p> <p>Cameron argued the need for a swift inquiry into what he described as an \"appalling\" scandal.</p> <p>\"People want to know that crime in our banks, crime in our financial services, will be pursued and punished like crimes on our streets,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I think as well as people being held accountable, they want rapid action to make sure this cannot happen again. In my view the most important thing about an inquiry is that it is swift and decisive, set up as fast as possible, gets going as fast as possible, reports as fast as possible, transparent and open at every stage.</p> <p>\"That's why I favour a public, parliamentary inquiry rather than a judge-led inquiry. I want us to legislate on this, starting next year.\"</p> <p>But Miliband said there were concerns that a parliamentary inquiry would be \"far too narrow\" in its focus on the Libor rate \"when we know the problems go much wider to the culture and practices in the City\".</p> <p>Cameron said he would look at the proposal for a two-part inquiry but added: \"On the issue of the structure of banking and the future of banking, we set up the Vickers inquiry which reported and we are going to implement the Vickers inquiry which will, for the first time, separate investment banking from retail banking. It's a major step forward.</p> <p>\"Second point: the inquiry, the parliamentary inquiry we are proposing, is wider than you say. It is going to look at the culture of banking.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Clearly, the Serious Fraud Office are still considering whether to launch a criminal investigation.</p> <p>\"While that's happening there are dangers in opting for a judge-led inquiry which might not be able to get under way.\"</p> <p>The parliamentary inquiry was the best way to \"get action as fast as possible\", he said.</p> <p>Labour's call for a judge-led inquiry was rejected in a vote in the Lords by 251 to 197 on Tuesday. But in an attempt to force the issue further, Cameron announced that MPs would be asked to vote on Thursday on either setting up a judicial inquiry or a joint parliamentary inquiry of peers and MPs, as proposed by the government.</p> <p>Cameron threw down the gauntlet to Miliband to back the parliamentary inquiry if MPs voted in favour of it, but the Labour leader did not respond to the challenge.</p>",

The memo written by Diamond \u2013 and sent to the then chief executive John Varley and copied to Del Missier \u2013 implied Tucker was receiving pressure from Whitehall figures to tackle Barclays' relatively high interest rates. The identity of those Whitehall figures is not yet clear. Lady Vadera, the economist who advised Gordon Brown and was made a minister, denied that she had spoken to Tucker about Libor rates. She also rejected claims that she authored a Treasury note titled Reducing Libor, but insisted it dealt with entirely legitimate government concerns. \"I did not have a conversation with Paul Tucker about Libor,\" she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. \"I did not have the conversation that is being alleged and I didn't write that note. \"I commented on the note, in particular to focus the issues on the lending conditions in the real economy for real people.\" Asked if anyone in the Labour government had suggested to the Bank of England that the rate should be manipulated, she said: \"I can only speak for myself. I can't obviously speak for everybody in government. \"You asked me if Libor was a concern and of course it was a concern. There is nothing wrong with concerning yourself with access to credit. That's the job.\" But that concern \"cannot be confused or used as an excuse for the actions of traders who choose, for their own reasons and for their own book, to do certain things\", she added. In the Commons the prime minister said it would be \"inexplicable\" and wrong if top bankers who were forced out or quit as a result of scandals received \"a vast payoff\". Amid reports that Diamond could be in line for a payout of up to \u00a322m, Cameron was urged by fellow Conservative Sir Peter Tapsell to ensure \"the delinquents are not able to walk away with their bonuses and severance payments\". Cameron told MPs: \"I think it would be completely wrong if people who were leaving under these circumstances were given some vast payoff. It would be completely inexplicable to the British public and it would not be right, and I very much hope that doesn't happen.\" The prime minister said the government would legislate so that all pay deals were put to shareholders in a binding vote \"and those deals should include any severance payments\". Earlier in the day, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, bemoaned the fact that Diamond would not be \"short of a bob or two\", despite leaving the bank under a cloud. Clegg said: \"I think many people will be dismayed, as he's leaving under a cloud, that he might be paid handsomely, he'll get handsome rewards for having presided over serious wrongdoing.\" While there appeared to be cross-party consensus against payoffs, the deadlock over the nature of the inquiry that should be held into the failures of banking continued as Cameron underlined his preference for a \"swift and decisive\" parliamentary inquiry over Labour's call for a judge-led independent investigation. Ed Miliband told the prime minister across the dispatch box that his reluctance to set up an investigation along the lines of the Leveson inquiry into media practices showed he did not understand the scale of public concern over the banking scandal. The Labour leader used prime minister's question time to set out a proposal for a two-stage inquiry, with an initial investigation into Libor rigging completed by Christmas and then a wider 12-month investigation of the culture and practices of the City. Miliband said: \"The banking scandal of the last week has revealed traders cheating, the mis-selling of insurance products to small businesses and comes on top of other scandals in the banking system and the continuing multimillion bonus merry-go-round.\" He asked the prime minister: \"How can you convince people that a parliamentary inquiry is a better way of restoring people's confidence than a full, independent, forensic and open judge-led inquiry?\" Cameron argued the need for a swift inquiry into what he described as an \"appalling\" scandal. \"People want to know that crime in our banks, crime in our financial services, will be pursued and punished like crimes on our streets,\" he said. \"I think as well as people being held accountable, they want rapid action to make sure this cannot happen again. In my view the most important thing about an inquiry is that it is swift and decisive, set up as fast as possible, gets going as fast as possible, reports as fast as possible, transparent and open at every stage. \"That's why I favour a public, parliamentary inquiry rather than a judge-led inquiry. I want us to legislate on this, starting next year.\" But Miliband said there were concerns that a parliamentary inquiry would be \"far too narrow\" in its focus on the Libor rate \"when we know the problems go much wider to the culture and practices in the City\". Cameron said he would look at the proposal for a two-part inquiry but added: \"On the issue of the structure of banking and the future of banking, we set up the Vickers inquiry which reported and we are going to implement the Vickers inquiry which will, for the first time, separate investment banking from retail banking. It's a major step forward. \"Second point: the inquiry, the parliamentary inquiry we are proposing, is wider than you say. It is going to look at the culture of banking.\" He added: \"Clearly, the Serious Fraud Office are still considering whether to launch a criminal investigation. \"While that's happening there are dangers in opting for a judge-led inquiry which might not be able to get under way.\" The parliamentary inquiry was the best way to \"get action as fast as possible\", he said. Labour's call for a judge-led inquiry was rejected in a vote in the Lords by 251 to 197 on Tuesday. But in an attempt to force the issue further, Cameron announced that MPs would be asked to vote on Thursday on either setting up a judicial inquiry or a joint parliamentary inquiry of peers and MPs, as proposed by the government. Cameron threw down the gauntlet to Miliband to back the parliamentary inquiry if MPs voted in favour of it, but the Labour leader did not respond to the challenge.",

      "bodyText": "Ed Miliband and David Cameron have held telephone talks about the political impasse over the nature of the parliamentary inquiry into the banking crisis. The revelation of the talks, which took place on Tuesday at lunchtime, including a discussion of Cameron's plan to ask the Commons to choose between a parliamentary inquiry and a judge-led inquiry, suggests there may some flexibility emerging between the two parties. Labour expects to lose the vote, to be held on Thursday, but has not said what it proposes to do in the wake of such a defeat. The government continued to argue that a parliamentary inquiry was preferable since it would be quicker, and, in a new argument, suggested it would enjoy parliamentary privilege. But the prime minister's spokesman showed flexibility over the composition of the inquiry, its terms of reference and even its timescale. It is possible that Labour will argue it would be better if the chairman of the inquiry was a cross-party figure. Lord Turnbull, the former head of the civil service, has been proposed as a possible substitute for Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chairman of the Treasury select committee, who has been asked by the government to lead the inquiry. The Treasury select committee is divided on whether to allow the joint parliamentary select committee to go ahead. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, and Lord Myners, Labour's City minister during the banking crisis, have categorically denied speaking to anyone at the Bank of England about the Libor rate-setting process. Bob Diamond, who resigned as chief executive of Barclays, is due to face the Treasury select committee and is expected to make explosive revelations about the role of City watchdogs and senior Whitehall figures in the manipulation of crucial interest rates that landed the bank with a record \u00a3290m fine last week. At his appearance before the committee of MPs \u2013 chaired by Tyrie \u2013 Diamond will try to explain the bank's actions between 2005 and 2009, when the attempts to manipulate Libor took place. Barclays released an email written by Diamond recording a conversation with Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, in October 2008, which will be scrutinised by MPs. The reference in the email to Whitehall sources asking Tucker why Barclays's submissions were higher than those of its rivals sparked speculation about potential involvement from government ministers. Balls categorically denied any contact with Tucker in his time as an adviser and then a minister in the Treasury and said he was \"very happy\" to give evidence to an inquiry. \"There have been some false allegations made about this overnight, for political reasons as always,\" the shadow chancellor told the BBC. \"At no point did I have any conversations with Mr Tucker at all, at any time when I was a Treasury minister and Treasury adviser or, subsequently to that, when I was a cabinet minister. \"I had no conversation with anybody about the Libor market during any of those periods and at no point, in any of the time that I was a minister or an adviser, were concerns raised about the Libor market from the FSA, the Bank or the Treasury to me. \"The idea that I have an issue on this or that I should be nervous this afternoon is completely false and untrue \u2026 and I would be very happy to say that to an inquiry.\" Myners said the government at the time was busy trying to ensure that banks were able to fund themselves. \"We were interested in what was happening in the real world, not what was happening in the Libor area,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. Alistair Darling, the Labour former chancellor, said on Tuesday he had made no calls to the Bank asking them to put pressure on anyone to lower Libor rates and said he would find it \"absolutely astonishing\" if the Bank of England had ordered the banks to lower rates. \"I would find it absolutely astonishing that the bank would ever make such a suggestion, and equally I can think of no circumstances that anyone in departments for which I was responsible \u2013 the Treasury \u2013 would ever suggest wrongdoing like this.\" Myners said he believed the Bank of England would have a recording or a formal minute of the conversation between Tucker and Diamond to confirm whether such an exchange took place and accused the Conservatives of \"putting a lot of flak\" on the email in a bid to \"try to take the take attention away from their role here\". The peer said: \"We will find the answer to this quite quickly. We will find out, because I am absolutely sure that Paul Tucker either has a recording of that conversation or he would have had his private secretary listening to the call and Paul Tucker will have his own contemporaneous record.\" Myners said he was not aware of anyone in Whitehall raising the issue with the Bank of England \u2013 and insisted the Treasury at the time was not interested in the Libor-setting process.",

      "bodyText": "Hopes that the Bank of England will unleash a fresh round of quantitative easing on Thursday to kickstart the economy have been boosted by a weaker-than-expected survey of Britain's key services sector. The Purchasing Managers' Index for services fell to 51.3 in June from 53.3 in May, suggesting the sector grew at its weakest pace in eight months, against the background of renewed turmoil in the eurozone. The weak reading undermined hopes of a sharp rebound from the double-dip recession, after similar surveys for manufacturing and construction showed declining output. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said the survey \"further undermines hopes that the economy avoided further contraction in the second quarter, especially as it was handicapped by the extra day public holiday resulting from the Queen's diamond jubilee\".

Separate PMI surveys released for the eurozone showed services firms have continued to cut output as the sovereign debt crisis takes its toll on demand. The composite PMI, which measures the strength of services sector across all 17 member countries of the eurozone, registered 46.4 in June, edging up from 46 in May but still suggesting a downturn in the sector. \"Even Germany looks to have fallen into a renewed decline, though only a very modest drop in output is signalled.

The reference in the email to Whitehall sources asking Tucker why Barclays's submissions were higher than those of its rivals sparked speculation about potential involvement from government ministers. Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor, said on Tuesday he had made no calls to the bank asking them to put pressure on anyone to lower Libor rates and said he would find it \"absolutely astonishing\" if the Bank of England had ordered the banks to lower its rates. \"I would find it absolutely astonishing that the bank would ever make such a suggestion, and equally I can think of no circumstances that anyone in departments for which I was responsible \u2013 the Treasury \u2013 would ever suggest wrongdoing like this.\" Myners said he believed the Bank of England would have a recording or a formal minute of the conversation between Tucker and Diamond to confirm whether such an exchange took place and accused the Conservatives of \"putting a lot of flak\" on the email in a bid to \"try to take the take attention away from their role here\".

The Bank was given added cause to consider a fresh stimulus on Tuesday when the latest snapshot of the construction sector revealed a marked deterioration in business conditions and heightened fears of a deepening of the UK's double-dip recession in the second quarter of 2012. The CIPS/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index dropped from 54.4 to 48.2 in June \u2013 below the 50 level that separates a sector that is expanding from one that is contracting. Weakness in construction was a big factor behind the economy's 0.3% decline in the first three months of 2012 and analysts warned that the latest data pointed to another quarter of falling output. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said the evidence from the PMI was that construction was contracting at its fastest rate in two and a half years, but that the extra bank holiday to mark the Queen's diamond jubilee probably played a part. \"The weather may also be playing a part \u2013 it's close to being the wettest June in England since 1910.

There were 51,098 mortgage approvals for house purchase in May worth \u00a37.6bn \u2013 the lowest figure since March and significantly down on a 25-month high in January, while the number of approvals for remortgaging also fell back in May, to 29,244 loans worth \u00a34bn \u2013 the lowest number of loans since February. The amount of unsecured credit taken on by consumers leapt to \u00a3732m in May, driven by a sharp rise in borrowing through overdrafts and personal loans, according to figures from the Bank, but one expert warned that the near-doubling from April's \u00a3379m might be the result of consumers struggling to make ends meet. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: \"With inflation continuing to outstrip earnings growth, it takes more and more of our income to put food on the table, travel to work and power our homes. As a result, people have cut back on their spending significantly. However, some find they can't cut back any more, and are borrowing to bridge the gap.\" Last month's rise in unsecured borrowing was fuelled by new borrowing on overdrafts and loans, which increased by \u00a3603m over the month, while credit card borrowing rose by just \u00a370m. Even so, the increase was below the \u00a31.1bn monthly average since 1993.",
