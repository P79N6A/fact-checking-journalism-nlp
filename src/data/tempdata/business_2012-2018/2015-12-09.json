      "bodyText": "Temporary workers at Sports Direct, the booming retail chain controlled by the billionaire Mike Ashley, are receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage, an investigation by the Guardian can reveal. Warehouse staff at the group, which is controlled by Britain\u2019s 22nd richest man, are required to go through searches at the end of each shift, for which their time is unpaid, while they also suffer harsh deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift just one minute late. The practices contribute to many staff being paid an effective rate of about \u00a36.50 an hour against the statutory rate of \u00a36.70 \u2013 potentially saving the FTSE 100 firm millions of pounds a year at the expense of some of the poorest workers in the UK. The discovery of the low pay being received by Sports Direct workers comes on top of a string of criticisms of the working conditions within the retailer\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where more than 80% of staff are on zero hours contracts. Workers are also: Harangued by tannoy for not working fast enough. Warned they will be sacked if they receive six black marks \u2013 or \u201cstrikes\u201d (see document below) \u2013 over a six-month period for offences including a \u201cperiod of reported sickness\u201d; \u201cerrors\u201d; \u201cexcessive/long toilet breaks\u201d; \u201ctime wasting\u201d; \u201cexcessive chatting\u201d; \u201chorseplay\u201d; and \u201cusing a mobile phone in the warehouse\u201d. Banned from wearing 802 separate clothing brands at work. Have to go through rigorous searches \u2013 down to the last layer of clothing, asked to roll up trouser legs and show top of underwear \u2013 which typically takes 15 minutes, because management is so concerned about potential theft. Meanwhile: Local primary schoolteachers have told the Guardian that pupils can remain in school while ill \u2013 and return home to empty houses \u2013 as parents working at Sports Direct are too frightened to take time off work. Union officers say the strict culture in the warehouse has resulted in workers being afraid to speak out over low pay and conditions as they fear immediately losing their jobs. The criticisms of Sports Direct \u2013 which have also included questions about whether its pricing policies are misleading, as well as the influence Ashley has on a company whose shares are held by many UK pension funds \u2013 come as the public company continues to dominate the UK sports retailing market and its trading performance flourishes. The retailer is expected to announce more positive results to the City on Thursday \u2013 part of a financial success story that is almost entirely credited to the unconventional retailing nous of Ashley, a self-made man whose fortune amounts to \u00a33.5bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. By placing two undercover reporters inside Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse, as well as interviewing former employees and speaking with workers about their roles while the journalists were employed on the site, the Guardian has established that many workers are in effect receiving less than the minimum wage per hour, over the total time they are required to spend in the warehouse and after financial penalties. All warehouse workers are kept onsite at the end of each shift in order to undergo a compulsory search by Sports Direct security staff, with the experience of the Guardian reporters suggesting this typically adds another hour and 15 minutes to the working week \u2013 which is unpaid. The discovery raises questions of whether such practices are within the law relating to the minimum wage. Lawyers said that paying workers for going through compulsory security checks had never been specifically tested under European law, but they added that a recent ruling by the European court of justice on the working time directive, which related to technicians travelling to customers\u2019 premises to install equipment, appeared applicable to the policies employed in Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse. That ruling stated that as the workers\u2019 travelling time could \u201cneither be shortened nor used freely by the technicians for their own interests\u201d then they were \u201cat the disposal\u201d of their employer. Therefore, their time is covered by the directive and counts as working time. Zoe Lagadec, a solicitor at Mulberry\u2019s Employment Law Solicitors, said: \u201cGiven that the employees are not free to leave their place of work until and unless the security check has been completed, this time should be considered \u2018working time\u2019 and therefore paid in accordance with the national minimum wage provisions.\u201d Furthermore, Sports Direct workers are docked 15 minutes of pay for clocking in as little as one minute late \u2013 even if they have arrived on the site on time. Conversely, staff are not paid extra for clocking out late, even when they have been finishing a job. Literature handed to one of the reporters by The Best Connection employment agency, used by Sports Direct, said: \u201cIf you do not clock in by your shift start time then you will be recorded as LATE for that day and your hours and pay will be reduced by a minimum of 15 minutes.\u201d Lagadec added that docking 15 minutes of pay for clocking in slightly late is \u201carguably a breach of the national minimum wage, which carries both criminal and civil sanctions\u201d. The legal basis of her views was also confirmed to the Guardian by an employment law barrister at one of London\u2019s top legal chambers. The Guardian\u2019s undercover reporters were employed during November by the two main agencies used by Sports Direct to supply temporary warehouse staff \u2013 Transline Group and The Best Connection. The Best Connection worker was docked 15 minutes\u2019 pay after arriving at the warehouse on time, but clocking in about five minutes late. Meanwhile, the Transline worker was not paid extra after clocking off five minutes later than the official end of the shift, when he had been finishing a job. Overall, the reporters\u2019 pay was 3% lower than it would have been without the penalty and including the time spent on the retailer\u2019s compulsory searches. It averaged about \u00a36.50 an hour over all the shifts the reporters worked in November. Other workers also confirmed that these practices were longstanding and commonplace. If calculated over the whole workforce, the savings would amount to millions of pounds on the annual wage bill of a warehouse, where up to 5,000 workers are thought to report for work each day. At busy times, wages have hit \u00a31m a week within the facility, which is currently being almost doubled in size. A Transline spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not breach national minimum wage legislation. Like many other retail warehouse operations throughout the UK, Shirebrook also has a policy of searches for all warehouse employees, office staff, senior management, directors and visitors. As with all policies, these are constantly under review. The searches are conducted in accordance with employment contracts and are completed as quickly as possible.\u201d He added that docking 15 minutes\u2019 pay for being one minute late was \u201cnot standard procedure\u201d. Sports Direct said the Guardian\u2019s findings contained \u201cinaccuracies\u201d but declined to comment further. The Best Connection agency declined to comment. Luke Primarolo, regional officer at the union Unite, said: \u201cHMRC needs to urgently investigate what looks like a breach of the minimum wage. The majority of these workers are on precarious agency contracts, which while not illegal, make it virtually impossible for them to challenge unfair treatment for fear of losing their job. The culture of fear at Sport Direct\u2019s Shirebrook depot is more akin to a workhouse than a FTSE 100 company. It needs to change with agency workers being given permanent contracts by Sports Direct and paid a decent wage.\u201d The findings that Sports Direct workers are receiving less than the minimum wage follows recent controversy over redundancies at one of Sports Direct\u2019s fashion chains, USC. In October, Sports Direct\u2019s chief executive, David Forsey, pleaded not guilty to a criminal charge of failing to give 30 days\u2019 notice for redundancies at the subsidiary. The case\u2019s next hearing is scheduled for the spring. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cIt will surprise no one that Sports Direct is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons again. All workers should be paid at least the minimum wage for every minute they are required to be on company premises. If the allegations against Sports Direct are found to be true, the government must make sure all their staff receive the full pay they are entitled to.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said: \u201cWe are determined that everyone who is entitled to the national minimum wage receives it. HMRC investigates every complaint made to the Acas helpline. In addition, HMRC conducts risk-based enforcement in sectors or areas where there is a higher risk of workers not getting paid the legal minimum wage.\u201d",

Subscribers to that school of thought may be untroubled by this paper\u2019s revelations about grim working conditions at the company\u2019s huge Shirebrook distribution centre in Derbyshire. Warehouses are rarely uplifting places, it will be argued. Cheap prices for shoppers usually imply clinical efficiency and low wages behind the scenes. Isn\u2019t there something refreshingly counterintuitive in how Ashley has rejected the fashion for greater automation to rely instead on manual labour to sort the replica football kits and trainers? Isn\u2019t the heavy use of imported workers \u2013 to the extent that signs inside Shirebrook are in Polish as well as English \u2013 just the product of EU laws allowing the free movement of labour? All those points will be made. Yet even outside shareholders in Sports Direct \u2013 those who own the 45% of shares not controlled by Ashley \u2013 should pause to wonder. As Michael O\u2019Leary discovered at Ryanair, penny-pinching can get you a long way in a consumer-facing industry but, after a while, a reputation for plain nastiness can be bad for business. Sports Direct may be at that point soon. This is a company led by a billionaire where the top 2,000 managers enjoy share-based incentives that have made many seriously rich. Yet the enterprise depends on the work of many more thousands of workers, some walking 20 miles a day, earning minimum wages on zero-hours contracts. Rewards at the top and bottom of companies have diverged across the corporate landscape, but Sports Direct is in a league of its own. Many retailers use zero-hours contracts, arguing that some workers like the flexibility. But, on the warehouse floor at Shirebrook, temporary jobs are the overwhelming majority. Workers are also security checked on their own time, an ingenious way to deflate even a minimum wage. The hunt for ever-greater efficiencies has led to complaints from unlikely quarters. When schoolteachers complain they are unable to contact parents in an emergency (because talking on a mobile phone is banned at Shirebrook), the employer has surely lost any connection to its local community. Single-minded drive is part of the reason why Sports Direct has wiped the floor with most of its competitors. Sooner or later, though, grubby behaviour \u2013 to put it at its mildest \u2013 usually returns to bite. Sports Direct\u2019s share price has been virtually flat for two years, despite increased profits. Maybe even the City senses increasing risks. Anglo American straps in for the ride Welcome to the Anglo American rollercoaster. Tuesday\u2019s 12% fall in its shares was followed by the same again on Wednesday morning, only for a recovery of sorts to leave the price down only a few pennies on the day. Volatility is the norm with mining stocks these days, but that\u2019s going some. The chief executive, Mark Cutifani, will probably have to get used to it. Investing in Anglo has become a bet on the debt-laden company\u2019s ability to execute its get smaller strategy without tapping shareholders for fresh capital. Not everybody likes the odds. \u201cFor Anglo, a dilutive equity issuance would be a positive as it would help reduce the downside tail risk, but the window of opportunity is closing,\u201d reckons Jefferies\u2019 analyst. That\u2019s correct: rights issues are best launched early. Cutifani will be a hero if he can steer Anglo through the commodities storm without a cash call. Remember, though, that Ivan Glasenberg had the same ambition for Glencore in August. Three weeks later, he announced a $2.5bn placing in response to \u201crecent stakeholder engagement\u201d. One can argue that Glencore, with a big marketing division that requires an investment-grade credit rating, is a different beast from Anglo, a conventional miner. But leverage is leverage and Anglo is now a $8bn company with a $13bn-plus pile of debt. If shareholders think Cutifani\u2019s ambitious plan for disposals and closures requires a safety blanket, they should shout \u2013 loudly and soon. Woodford Rolls over Lauded fund manager Neil Woodford famously didn\u2019t own any bank shares after 2002, judging their business models to be impenetrable (good call).

So there is piquancy in Woodford now dumping Rolls-Royce, which he has held for almost a decade, because he\u2019s lost confidence after the latest profits warning and thinks the civil aerospace engine division is \u201cpretty opaque and difficult to analyse\u201d.

    "webTitle": "Anger over threat of VAT hike on renewable energy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has shocked the renewable energy industry by proposing a massive hike in VAT on solar panels and wind turbines from next summer. The moves, announced by the revenue and customs authority, HMRC, made \u201ca mockery of (David) Cameron\u2019s claims to climate leadership\u201d say critics and come amid proposed cuts of almost 90% in some solar subsidies. HMRC blamed the planned increase in VAT from 5-20% on a European commission ruling covering energy saving materials used in the construction trade and said the EC decision had been upheld by the court of justice of the EU. But the UK tax authorities stoked anger within the industry by claiming the changes would do little damage. \u201cThe measure is likely to affect fewer than 500,000 individuals and households and the impact \u2026 is anticipated to be negligible,\u201d it wrote in a consultation document released on Wednesday. The Solar Trade Association (STA), lobby group for the photovoltaic sector, said it was an astonishing and avoidable blow that could add \u00a3900 to a typical domestic rooftop installation and would only serve to suck even more potential investment from low carbon power. \u2018As countries are racing to secure the new global climate agreement, the UK has just proposed quadrupling VAT on solar installations for people\u2019s homes to 20%, while oil heating, coal and gas remain on 5%. The International Energy Agency is in Paris right now calling for an end to fossil fuels subsidies just as the Treasury proposes tilting the playing field here away from clean power for British households,\u201d \u201cThis is clearly absurd. We will be strongly urging the Treasury to treat solar the same as they propose for oil, gas, heat pumps and biomass boilers. But it is incredible to have to argue for even level VAT treatment for solar VAT just as the Paris conference demands greatly accelerated action to avoid dangerous climate change.\u201d The solar industry is already nervous as it waits to hear next week whether ministers will proceed with a swath of cuts to the feed in tariff subsidies. The STA said it was hopeful ministers would reach a compromise but remained concerned thatthe cuts could still be too heavy to save a sector reeling from thousands of redundancies as business confidence evaporates. Greenpeace said the government should be resisting any misguided regulations from Brussels at a time when it was pushing for lower carbon emissions at the UN climate change talks. \u201cA vital part of the sustainable energy future being championed in Paris today is being undermined in London by changes to VAT that must be resisted,\u201d said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK. \u201cIn addition to the confusion created by dramatic cuts to solar support, this creates a new round of uncertainty for business, and more expense for homeowners who are seeking to do their bit for the climate, as loudly requested by David Cameron last week. This move makes a mockery of Cameron\u2019s claims to climate leadership, and shows once again that is Osborne who is ultimately holding the reins on energy policy in the UK.\u201d Leo Murray, a campaigner for the 10:10 climate change charity, added: \u201cOur government promised to fight this. Something very wrong is going on with the EU tax system when short haul flights are zero rated for VAT meanwhile people who are trying to do the right thing by generating their own energy are being massively penalised for buying products that are absolutely essential to meeting legally binding targets on renewable energy and our climate change objectives.\u201d Critics want to know why some technologies such as insulation, draft-proofing, central heating and biomass boilers will not be affected by the change and yet wind and solar seem to have been singled out. They suggest the government can avoid VAT increases if it shows that the solar panels or wind turbines are being used as part of a wider strategy to beat fuel poverty. A spokesman for HMRC said the British tax authorities had done all they could by arguing in court for a different outcome. \u201cWe lost the case. We cannot appeal or go any further so we have to make changes to the rules to comply with European law.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government remains committed to improving UK homes to help tackle fuel poverty and keep energy bills low. Despite the EU\u2019s ruling, we will continue to help the most vulnerable, such as the elderly, with the installation of energy saving materials, by retaining the vast majority of the relief on energy saving materials.\u201d",

The International Energy Agency is in Paris right now calling for an end to fossil fuels subsidies just as the Treasury proposes tilting the playing field here away from clean power for British households,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is clearly absurd. We will be strongly urging the Treasury to treat solar the same as they propose for oil, gas, heat pumps and biomass boilers. But it is incredible to have to argue for even level VAT treatment for solar VAT just as the Paris conference demands greatly accelerated action to avoid dangerous climate change.\u201d </p> <p>The solar industry is already nervous as it waits to hear next week whether ministers will proceed with a swath of cuts to the feed in tariff subsidies. </p> <p>The STA said it was hopeful ministers would reach a compromise but remained concerned thatthe cuts could still be too heavy to save a sector reeling from thousands of redundancies as business confidence evaporates.</p> <p>Greenpeace said the government should be resisting any misguided regulations from Brussels at a time when it was pushing for lower carbon emissions at the UN climate change talks. </p> <p>\u201cA vital part of the sustainable energy future being championed in Paris today is being undermined in London by changes to VAT that must be resisted,\u201d said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK. </p> <p>\u201cIn addition to the confusion created by dramatic cuts to solar support, this creates a new round of uncertainty for business, and more expense for homeowners who are seeking to do their bit for the climate, as loudly requested by David Cameron last week. This move makes a mockery of Cameron\u2019s claims to climate leadership, and shows once again that is Osborne who is ultimately holding the reins on energy policy in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Leo Murray, a campaigner for the 10:10 climate change charity, added: \u201cOur government promised to fight this. Something very wrong is going on with the EU tax system when short haul flights are zero rated for VAT meanwhile people who are trying to do the right thing by generating their own energy are being massively penalised for buying products that are absolutely essential to meeting legally binding targets on renewable energy and our climate change objectives.\u201d</p> <p>Critics want to know why some technologies such as insulation, draft-proofing, central heating and biomass boilers will not be affected by the change and yet wind and solar seem to have been singled out. </p> <p>They suggest the government can avoid VAT increases if it shows that the solar panels or wind turbines are being used as part of a wider strategy to beat fuel poverty.</p> <p>A spokesman for HMRC said the British tax authorities had done all they could by arguing in court for a different outcome. \u201cWe lost the case. We cannot appeal or go any further so we have to make changes to the rules to comply with European law.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThe government remains committed to improving UK homes to help tackle fuel poverty and keep energy bills low. Despite the EU\u2019s ruling, we will continue to help the most vulnerable, such as the elderly, with the installation of energy saving materials, by retaining the vast majority of the relief on energy saving materials.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Taittinger is to become the first French champagne house to produce fizz in the UK after investing in a former Kent apple orchard. The company has teamed up with British wine agents Hatch Mansfield and private investors to buy 69 hectares of farmland near Chilham and expects to fill its first bottles in five years. In a \u00a34m investment plan, the first 40 hectares at Selling Court farm will be planted with chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier grapes in 2017 to produce English sparkling wine \u2013 only fizz produced in the Champagne region of France can carry the title. Pierre-Emmanuel Taittinger, president of Champagne Taittinger, said: \u201cWe believe we can produce a high quality English sparkling wine drawing upon on our 80 years of winemaking expertise. Our aim is to make something of real excellence in the UK\u2019s increasingly temperate climate, and not to compare it with champagne or any other sparkling wine.\u201d The UK is Taittinger\u2019s biggest export market, accounting for a quarter of its sales outside France, and Taittinger said the company wanted to \u201ccreate something special to show our appreciation of the UK support for champagne\u201d. The new wine will be named Domaine \u00c9vremond, after Charles de Saint-\u00c9vremond, who is credited with helping introduce 17th-century London to the habit of quaffing champagne. The French soldier and writer fled to England after falling out of favour with the court of King Louis XIV. A noted gourmet and wit, he became one the most famous Frenchmen in the capital, not least as an importer of champagne. He promoted a still version of the wine, which helped make him such a hit with Charles II that he was rewarded with the lucrative position of governor of the Duck Islands, a group of islets in St James\u2019s Park. \u00c9vremond remained in London until he died, aged 90, and was buried in Poet\u2019s Corner in Westminster Abbey. Taittinger said the chalky soil and south-facing slopes in Kent created the ideal terroir \u2013 soil, microclimate and topography \u2013 to plant and grow high-quality grapes for sparkling wine. The British land gives the French company an opportunity to expand, which is difficult in its home town of Rheims, where land for new vineyards is almost impossible to find and would cost more than \u00a31.5m a hectare to plant compared with between \u00a360,000 and \u00a370,000 in Kent. Taittinger\u2019s investment comes amid a boom in English sparkling wine production. Champagne producers have been rumoured to have an interest in investing in the UK for some time, as the rising popularity of homegrown fizz threatens to eat into their market. Burgeoning demand for brands such as Nyetimber, Chapel Down, Camel Valley and Ridgeview is turning parts of the South Downs and beyond into an English \u00c9pernay after a doubling of the amount of land devoted to vineyards in the past seven years and a 43% rise in wine production last year. Chapel Down raised \u00a34m via a crowdfunding exercise last year to back expansion into a further 326 acres of vineyard in Kent over five years. Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, which represents the UK industry, said: \u201cYou cannot get a much better seal of approval than a Champagne house as renowned as Taittinger recognising the quality of the sparkling wine we can produce on UK soil.\u201d He said the British appetite for fizz was continuing to grow. But champagne was losing out to other sparkling tipples \u2013 including prosecco and cava as well as English wines. Last year, Britons spent more on prosecco than on champagne for the first time. The Italian sparkling wine is winning favour as it is much cheaper than its French rival. In the past year, sales of all sparkling wines in supermarkets and other retailers in the UK have increased by 27% in volume, while sales of champagne have risen by just 1%. In pubs and restaurants the contrast is even more stark: sales of sparkling wines have risen 41% in volume, while champagne sales have remained static year on year. Pierpaolo Petrassi, head of buying for beers, wines and spirits at Waitrose, said its champagne sales had continued to rise but its growth was being outstripped by prosecco and English sparkling wine. He said English wine was increasingly popular because its quality had improved dramatically in recent years. \u201cIt has reached a critical mass. It\u2019s served at state banquets and has gained credibility and the press it deserves,\u201d he said. Petrassi said in blind tastings, English wines were often judged to be on a par, or even superior to champagnes. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to have something home grown that we could be proud of especially in an area that has been dominated by other countries for many many years,\u201d he said. Patrick McGrath of Hatch Mansfield said the joint venture with Taittinger would give the agent \u2013 which currently trades only in imported sparkling wines \u2013 and the Champagne brand a foothold in the fast-growing market for English fizz. \u201cWe passionately believe in the future of English sparkling wine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a market we feel we need to be in and an industry which is growing quickly.\u201d Petrassi said the investment by a globally recognised brand such as Taittinger would lend credibility to the English wine industry. \u201cIt creates a bridge between champagne and here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the industry has sought to do here is not just say it is a viable alternative to champagne but made sure people realise it is high quality and has a character of its own.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If you needed final proof that rap has sold out, here it is. The sole copy of the Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s super exclusive 2014 album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is now the property of a millionaire drug boss that Donald Trump called a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d. Robert Diggs, better known as the Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s RZA, announced in 2014 that they would produce only one copy of their next album, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, and sell it to the highest bidder. \u201cWe\u2019re about to put out a piece of art like nobody else has done in the history of music,\u201d RZA told Forbes. \u201cWe\u2019re making a single-sale collector\u2019s item. This is like someone having the scepter of an Egyptian king.\u201d That scepter is now in the hands of Martin Shkreli, the 32-year-old boss of Turing Pharmaceuticals, a man most famous for hiking the price of a drug used by cancer and Aids patients by 50-fold overnight, Bloomberg magazine reported on Wednesday. He paid $2m for the privilege. Shkreli tweeted: \u201cIf there is a curious gap in your favorite artist\u2019s discography, well, now you know why.\u201d He also added a link to his live-streaming channel \u2013 \u201ctalking music, drugs and stuff. May play something special\u201d \u2013 which at the time of writing showed video of chemical compounds and an empty chair in a bare-walled office. In November, the Senate opened an investigation into Shkreli\u2019s company over its decision to raise the price of Daraprim, a 62-year-old drug, from $13.50 to $750 a pill. Shkreli himself was summoned by Congress and is expected to testify on Wednesday. The price hike led to Shkreli being dubbed \u201cthe most hated man in America\u201d and attacks from Democratic presidential front runner Hillary Clinton as well as Trump and others. Wu-Tang producer RZA sent the magazine a statement to clarify that the group did not know of his business practices at the time of auction, misspelling Shkreli\u2019s name in the email. \u201cThe sale of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin was agreed upon in May,\u201d RZA wrote, \u201cwell before Martin Skhreli\u2019s [sic] business practices came to light. We decided to give a significant portion of the proceeds to charity.\u201d But Shkreli told Bloomberg that he has not actually listened to the Wu Tang album, which was recorded over several years by the surviving members. Only the record\u2019s two producers, RZA and Tarik \u201cCilvaringz\u201d Azzougarh, have heard the full 31-track double album, which had its duplicates destroyed and was stored in a vault in a Morocco hotel until the sale. \u201cI could be convinced to listen to it earlier if Taylor Swift wants to hear it or something like that,\u201d Shkreli told he magazine. \u201cBut for now, I think I\u2019m going to kind of save it for a rainy day.\u201d As a condition of the sale, Shkreli is not allowed to reproduce the album for sale, though he could make it available for free download if he wished. Album producers RZA and Azzougarh originally wanted to place an 88-year ban on releasing the album to the public, but were eventually convinced otherwise. In 2014, RZA told Forbes that the conceit behind the album was in part motivated by a desire to restore a cash value to music in the age of streaming and internet piracy. Music \u201cdoesn\u2019t receive the same treatment as art in the sense of what the value of what it is,\u201d he said. Shkreli, who started as a clerk at a hedge fund while still in college, has a history of business practices dubbed unscrupulous by critics and, occasionally, by former colleagues and at least one court. Shkreli has been accused of harassing a former colleague and his family on social media, even sending a friend request to the man\u2019s son with the message: \u201cI want you to know about your dad\u201d. The album is also not Shkreli\u2019s first brush with the media over a collector\u2019s item. He has purchased a credit card owned by Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain, an Enigma codebreaking machine and a guitar signed by Katy Perry that he mused, with a sad emoticon, would not buy him a date.",

      "bodyText": "The tumbling price of oil and a brutal battle for customers between supermarkets mean British drivers could be paying less than \u00a31 for a litre of fuel by Christmas, handing a boost to consumers for the festive season. The RAC has predicted that petrol prices will tumble on forecourts across the country and fall below \u00a31 at supermarkets in time for Christmas. This would be the first time since 2009 that petrol has been priced at less than \u00a31 across the country, although Asda ran a promotion on Black Friday last month offering petrol at 99.7p per litre and diesel for 103.7p per litre. The price of Brent crude oil fell below $40 a barrel for the first time since 2009 this week, with oil producers braced for further dramatic falls into the $20 range. Although the slump in the price of the commodity is causing havoc for oil and mining companies, consumers are set to benefit from further falls in the price of fuel for their vehicle just in time for Christmas. Simon Williams, RAC spokesman, said: \u201cWe expect Britain\u2019s supermarkets and cheapest fuel retailers to be selling petrol at \u00a31 a litre or less in time for Christmas. These retailers consistently tend to be 3p to 5p a litre cheaper than the UK average price. We are still some way off the average price of unleaded reaching the \u00a31 a litre mark but this will be a big step in the right direction.\u201d The RAC said there should be a 3p drop for petrol and 5p reduction for diesel at existing prices. This would take average prices to about 103p for petrol and 104p for diesel, with supermarkets even lower. If prices fall below \u00a31 this would represent a 30% drop in the price of petrol since it peaked at a national average of \u00a31.42 in April 2012. Supermarkets are leading the way in cutting the price of petrol as they battle for shoppers in the festive season. The four largest grocery chains \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 are losing market share to the discounters Aldi and Lidl. However, they all have petrol stations while the discounters do not, making it a vital weapon for the supermarket chains. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s have already announced they will cut the price of fuel by about 2p this week. According to the RMI Petrol Retailers Association, the average price of petrol stood at 106.9p on Tuesday, before the latest price cuts, but the wholesale price of petrol was just 80.73p. Brian Madderson, chairman of the PRA, said: \u201cWe could see something of a price war, particularly with the \u2018big four\u2019 supermarkets. They are under pressure from shareholders to have a good Christmas and they have got two discounters Aldi and Lidl snapping at their heels, but one of the points of difference they have is fuel. \u201cWe have already seen on Black Friday that Asda went to 99.7p, below cost, so in the run-up to Christmas anything is possible. Unfortunately for my independent members it is not good news. But \u00a31 a litre fuel will help their customers to get in the Christmas spirit.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There was no repeat of Tuesday\u2019s commodity driven market rout, but it was still a volatile day. With iron ore and oil prices still weak, shares were under pressure initially. But a biggest than expected fall in US crude stocks sent crude sharply higher, at least for a while, and gave some support to stock markets. After further consideration of the figures, however, investors decided they did not like the news of a weekly increase in distillate fuels, and crude slipped back once more, taking the markets with it. Anglo American slumped another 14% initially to a new low of 2277p before recovering to close just 1.2% lower while Fresnillo, down 8% at one point after news of a ruptured pipeline at its Saucito mine, ended down just 6p or 0.9%. Overall the scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 8.54 points or 0.14% at 6126.68 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.76% at 10,592.49 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.95% lower at 4637.45 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was down 0.17% at 21,500,88 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.02% lower at 9835.5 In Greece, the Athens market fell 3.8% to 559.79 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 111 points or 0.6% lower. Meanwhile Brent crude is down 1.5% at $39.62. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Crude prices have come off their best levels on further consideration of the US inventory figures. Yes, commercial crude stocks fell by a higher than expected 3.6m barrels last week, pointing to stronger demand. But stocks of distillate - diesel fuels and fuel oils - rose from 144.4m barrels to 149.4m. Brent is now up 0.52% at $40.47, down from its earlier peak of $41.59. Commenting on the US crude figures, David Morrison at Spread Co said: Crude oil inventories as reported by the Energy Information Exchange slumped by 3.6 million barrels for the week ending 4 December. This was far below the prior reading which showed a build of 1.2 million barrels. The consensus market expectation was for an increase of 700,000. The news led to crude flying higher to the general relief of investors. Persistent weakness in the oil market has weighed on both US and UK stocks. This is due to the major indices heavy weightings of energy stocks and companies who supply services, machinery and infrastructure to the sector. Both WTI and Brent contracts were firmer ahead of the release. The price of crude oil has fallen around 65% since the summer of 2014. The sell-off coincided with the recovery in the US dollar which rallied on expectations of Fed tightening. At the same time there is a glut of crude coming to market which continues to outstrip demand. But despite the drop in US crude stocks, they are still well above last year\u2019s levels: American oil stocks dropped by more than 3.5m barrels to 485.9m last week, a bigger than expected decline which has helped support the crude price. Fears of oversupply and lack of demand have sent oil prices tumbling, with last week\u2019s indecisive Opec meeting adding to the decline. But with US stocks down last week, demand appears to be higher than expected, so Brent crude has reacted by climbing 1.79% to $40.98. A Guardian investigation has revealed that Sports Direct, the retail group founded by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, has effectively been paying workers below the UK minimum wage. The full story is here: The European Central Bank says markets had unrealistic expectations about what stimulus measures the bank would unveil at last week\u2019s meeting, said policy maker Ewald Nowotny. Disappointment at the ECB announcement saw the euro move sharply higher, but Nowotny said the bank\u2019s communication was not to blame for the misunderstanding, Bloomberg is reporting. Not everyone is convinced by this argument. US markets have made an uncertain start, with an initial fall at the opening bell. But as trading got properly underway, shares began to move higher. A calmer day in the commodities market has seen Brent crude rise nearly 1% to $40.64 a barrel, while copper has risen on hopes that output cuts would put a floor under falling prices. Iron ore, however, remained under pressure, down another $0.5 to $38.30 a tonne. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up around 50 points or 0.3%, helped by reports of merger talks between Dow Chemical and DuPont. The rise has given some support to European markets, with the FTSE 100 now up 15 points while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac have come off their worst levels. Here\u2019s our full story on Volkswagen, and the news that just 36,000 or so cars have faulty CO2 emissions. The City usually likes the sound of job cuts and restructuring, but Anglo American\u2019s share price is still deep in the red today (down another 6%). And that\u2019s because analysts fear that axing the dividend, slashing capital expenditure, and losing 85,000 jobs may not be enough to protect Anglo from the mining slump. Des Kilalea, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says shares are sliding because Anglo may need to raise more cash from shareholders. RBC has cut its price target for Anglo to \u00a33 - which is pretty much where its trading today (down around 75% this year!) And Kilalea warns that there are several risks, which could hit Anglo\u2019s share price. They include: fluctuations in commodity prices, South African labour volatility, currencies in operating countries, greater than expected mine operating and new project construction costs, and increasing energy, material and manpower costs. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, Kilalea adds: In a very competitive environment, Anglo American, as with all mining companies, faces challenges finding and replacing mined reserves. The Greek stock market has shed almost 2% today, hitting its lowest level in over three years: Big names continue to pour into ICAP\u2019s offices in the City, and around the world, doing their bit for its charity day (see earlier post for details). The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are the star turn in London; they\u2019ve mingled with the traders raising money for a string of good causes. Kate has tested her skills on ICAP\u2019s trading: The revenues raised form trading today will be donated to a range of charities, including SkillForce, of which William is patron, and SportsAid and Place2Be, of which Kate is patron. Our future king and queen also squeezed in some ping pong \u2013 although not terribly well, frankly. It looks like quite a day: Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined by Swiss authorities over tax evasion allegations involving its wealth manager arm, Coutts. RBS will pay \u20ac23m to Swiss authorities to settle claims that staff at Coutt\u2019s international arm helped clients to dodge tax. The case hit the headlines back in February 2015. As we wrote at the time: German prosecutors are investigating current and former employees of the private bank\u2019s Zurich and Geneva offices. The bank looks after \u00a320bn belonging to 32,000 international customers including sovereigns, celebrities and multimillionaire entrepreneurs. Each must show they have at least \u00a31m in free cash to open an account \u2013 and even then they may not be allowed in. Coutts is famously the Queen\u2019s bank, although this case didn\u2019t involve staff in London. RBS sold the international arm of Coutts this spring, but retained liability for this case. It still owns the UK division. Back in the UK... policymakers at the Bank of England have warned that it is \u201cdifficult to predict\u201d how global markets will react to a US interest rate hike. And that is a worry, given that UK banks are rather exposed to emerging markets; they could suffer if capital surges back into American assets such as the dollar. Here\u2019s the story: You can see the moment that VW announced that its CO2 emissions problems only affected around 36,000 cars, not 800,000: Newsflash: The Volkswagen emissions scandal may not be as bad as feared. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker has announced that far fewer vehicles than originally thought have been pumping out more CO2 than claimed, and breaching fuel efficiency figures. According to VW, its investigation found that around 36,000 cars are affected, not the 800,000 vehicles initially estimated last month. Reuters has the details: \u201cOnly a small number of the model variants of new cars will have the catalogue (CO2) figure slightly adjusted,\u201d VW said on Tuesday, adding the number of affected cars was equivalent to about 36,000 vehicles. It\u2019s some relief for the carmaker, which will update the media on the emissions scandal tomorrow. Shares in Volkswagen have jumped by 4.5% today, as investors welcome the news. It had originally set aside \u20ac2bn to cover the problem; today\u2019s announcement suggests the financial impact will be significantly smaller. VW is not in the clear, though. The CO2 issue is separate from the original scandal, that millions of cars used secret software to disguise nitrogen oxide emissions. Anglo American\u2019s share price has plunged by 90% since its peak in early 2008, before the financial crisis. It did rally in 2010 and 2011, helped by solid demand from China for its coal and iron ore, as well as platinum and diamonds (Anglo\u2019s other main products) But, like other miners, the company has suffered from the emerging market slowdown, which has hurt demand for products like steel. Anyone who received mining shares from Father Christmas last year has our sympathies. The slump in Anglo American\u2019s shares (-8.5% at pixel time) has dragged the FTSE 100 into the red. The blue chip index is down 9 points now, hitting its lowest point since 16 November. Other mining companies are under pressure too. Fresnillo, the silver miner, is down 6%, while copper producer Antofagasta has dropped by 2%. Investors are worried that Anglo may not be the last mining company to axe its dividend in an attempt to preserve capital and ride out the slump. Alastair McCaig of IG explains: Once again the mining sector is dragging the FTSE lower, although not with the aggression seen yesterday. Worries that Anglo American\u2019s actions yesterday might become the template for others in that sector have seen investors running for the exits, as a second day of double-digit falls hit. Cost-cutting and asset stripping have already been exhausted and, as unattractive as it might be, trimming or suspending dividends might be the course of action that others have to follow. Anglo\u2019s decline is eye-watering. My colleague Nick Fletcher flags up that more than \u00a31bn has been wiped off its value since first thing yesterday, when it announced sweeping cutbacks. A quick shout-out for ICAP, the City brokerage which is holding its annual charity day today. The great, the good ( and the not-so good?) will all be manning the phones at ICAP\u2019s offices around the globe today. They\u2019ll be closing deals, swapping bon mots with traders and trying to raise as much as possible for a range of good causes. This year, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will both be taking part. Wills is a regular at ICAPs\u2019 fundraiser, but it\u2019s Kate\u2019s first year (good luck, ma\u2019am) Samantha Cameron, the PM\u2019s wife, is also lending a hand. And the president of Singapore has being doing his bit. Heavyweight champion boxer Tyson Fury, who has been widely criticised for a range of unsavoury, outdated and unwelcome comments, has tweeted that he might be taking part too: ICAP founder Michael Spencer was just interviewed on Bloomberg. He argued that the Federal Reserve should \u201cget it done now\u201d and raise interest rates at next week\u2019s meeting. Spencer, a former Conservative Party treasurer, is managing to sit on the Brexit fence. And asked about Britain\u2019s upcoming EU referendum, he said that: On balance, I think the business would be better if we stay in Europe. Spencer hasn\u2019t decided how he\u2019ll vote, though. And he earlier told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that Britain could thrive outside the EU. Anglo American\u2019s slump is deepening. The mining firm\u2019s shares have now tumbled by 11% today, meaning it has lost 76% of its value this year. Two interesting developments from China to flag up: 1) The People\u2019s Bank of Chine has fixed the yuan at its lowest level against the US dollar in four years. That indicates that the economic slowdown, and capital outflows, are hurting the yuan. The PBoC may be relaxing its efforts to defend the yuan, now that the IMF has agreed to add it to its currency basket. 2) China\u2019s inflation rate came in higher than expected last month, rising to 1.5% from 1.3% in October. However, the prices that Chinese firms are receiving for their goods (the producer prices index) fell again. That indicates weak demand - a key cause of the commodity crash. Societe Generale\u2019s Kit Juckes captures the mood this morning: Oil prices have stopped falling, at least for now. Commodity markets are quiet even as the press is dominated by their weakness. And there\u2019s a dearth of news to drive direction. There\u2019s not relief for Anglo American this morning, as the long-established mining group\u2019s shares hit fresh lows. Shares in Anglo have slumped by almost 6%, having tumbled by 12% on Tuesday to its lowest ever level. Investors clearly don\u2019t think the worst is over for Anglo, after it announced 85,000 job cuts and froze its dividend yesterday. Other mining stocks are recovering a little, though. Rio Tinto is up 0.8%, having hit the lowest since 2009 on Tuesday. BHP Billiton has gained 0.9%, staggering back from a 10-year low. After two days of turmoil, there is a sense of calm in the commodities sector today. Brent crude oil has gained 1.2% to $40.78 per barrel in early trading. That follows a truly dramatic day yesterday when it plunged below $40 before rebounding: US crude is gaining ground too - up 1.6% at $38.12 per barrel. But there\u2019s still plenty of nervousness in the markets. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says prices could easily subside again: The decision from OPEC late last week to leave production levels unchanged has left a damaging mark and with investor sentiment continuously weak, the gates have been left wide open for WTI Oil to trade to extremely low levels, the likes of which have not been seen since the beginning of 2009 when prices reached $35. Germany\u2019s trade surplus actually rose in October to over \u20ac20bn, because imports (-3.4%) fell faster than exports (-1.2%). That\u2019s close to the record surpluses posted this summer. Some may see this as a sign of Germany\u2019s industrial might - producing products the rest of the world is keen to buy. But it will also concern critics who argue that the German trade surplus is causing serious problems; sucking demand from elsewhere, and making it harder for its neighbours to grow. As America\u2019s former top central banker, Ben Bernanke, put it recently: In a slow-growing world that is short aggregate demand, Germany\u2019s trade surplus is a problem. Several other members of the euro zone are in deep recession, with high unemployment and with no \u201cfiscal space\u201d (meaning that their fiscal situations don\u2019t allow them to raise spending or cut taxes as a way of stimulating domestic demand). Despite signs of recovery in the United States, growth is also generally slow outside the euro zone. The fact that Germany is selling so much more than it is buying redirects demand from its neighbors (as well as from other countries around the world), reducing output and employment outside Germany at a time at which monetary policy in many countries is reaching its limits. Today\u2019s trade data show that Germany\u2019s economy is \u201cweakening, but not faltering\u201d, argues Carsten Brzeski, ING economist. He points out that demand from certain large emerging nations has contracted this year. During the first nine months of the year, exports to China were down by 2.5% compared with last year\u2019s period, showing the negative impact from the ongoing slowdown of the Chinese economy. At the same time, exports to Russia were slashed further, dropping another 28% on the back of sanctions. On the positive side, exports to the US surged by more than 20%, reflecting the direct impact of the euro weakening. Germany has benefitted strongly from the ultra-loose monetary policy in the eurozone this year (ironic, given it needed the stimulus rather less than, say, France or Italy) And Carsten predicts that this trend will continue in 2016, with the weak euro making German exports competitive. German exports have become an extremely mixed bag, always up for surprises and full of diverging trends. Due to too many economic slowdowns and geopolitical conflicts around the world, exports will continue having troubles gaining more momentum in the period ahead. However, as long as the monetary policy divergence on both sides of the Atlantic continues and the ECB continues with QE, exports should remain supportive to growth. Germany has kicked the day off with disappointing trade data which suggests Europe\u2019s largest economy is suffering from weakening demand at home, and abroad. German exports fell by 1.2 % month-on-month to \u20ac99bn in October (on a seasonally adjusted basis), according to the Federal Statistics Office. And imports took a sharper hit - contracting by 3.4% during the month to \u20ac78.3bn. It\u2019s a weaker performance than expected: The data also shows that the slowdown in emerging markets has been hurting Germany this year. Over the year, German exports outside the EU have shrunk by 0.9% while sales to other EU countries are up by 6.4%. Not a great sign for German growth this quarter.... I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be watching the commodity markets closely, after yesterday\u2019s rout. Some investors are feeling pretty bruised after seeing iron ore prices hit their lowest in a decade, oil plunge below $40/barrel, and mining company shares hit their lowest in years (or ever, in Anglo American\u2019s case). And worse could be ahead, if oil prices don\u2019t bottom out soon. As Alexei Moiseev, Russia\u2019s deputy finance minister, put it to Reuters: \u201cIf oil goes to $20, we will need to do additional [spending] cuts. Clearly we have shown that we are very willing to cut fiscal spending in line with an oil price at $60, for example. In order for us to be long-term sustainable [with the] oil price at $40, we need to do additional cuts, but if the oil price goes to $20 we need to do even more cuts.\u201d We get a new snapshot of America\u2019s oil industry at 3.3pm GMT today, when the latest US crude oil inventories are released. The commodity rout is raising new concerns over the resilience of the global economy, as America\u2019s central bank prepares to raise interest rates. We find out how worried the Bank of England, when the minutes of its latest Financial Policy Committee meeting are released at 9.30am. And transport group Stagecoach is releasing its results. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

    "webTitle": "FCA set to investigate HSBC amid claims of 'improper practices'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City regulator is set to launch an investigation into whether large numbers of people lost out financially because of \u201cimproper practices\u201d at HSBC, after a 12-year campaign by a whistleblower. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had originally decided to take no action in the case, which involves credit card customers being overcharged, but has reversed that decision after its complaints watchdog accused it of mishandling the matter. In a strongly worded 10-page ruling, the Office of the Complaints Commissioner, which investigates grievances relating to the regulator, said the FCA had presided over a series of events \u201cbordering on the farcical\u201d, was \u201cnegligent\u201d and \u201cdefensive\u201d, and had even attempted to \u201cshift [the] blame\u201d on to the whistleblower, Nicholas Wilson. The case concerns claims by Wilson that hundreds of thousands of people struggling with their credit card payments were overcharged by HFC Bank \u2013 and later HSBC, after it acquired HFC in 2003 \u2013 as a result of the way fees were added to the customers\u2019 accounts. Wilson also claimed there was evidence the FCA had failed to protect consumers adequately and was \u201ccolluding with HSBC\u201d on this matter. There is no argument about the fact that these charges were \u201cimproperly calculated\u201d and in 2010 the bank agreed to discontinue the practice. But there is a dispute about whether this was unlawful, how many people were affected and what action, if any, should have been taken against HSBC. In his ruling, Antony Townsend, the complaints commissioner, said the paperwork showed that in four cases consumers had been significantly overcharged and given refunds, but that Wilson claimed there were \u201cmany more disadvantaged clients\u201d. Wilson continued to campaign on the issue, but the FCA concluded that regulatory action was not necessary. It has now agreed to reconsider this decision. Among the FCA\u2019s many failings, said Townsend, was that it \u201ccopied and pasted\u201d what was clearly incorrect information supplied by HSBC into a letter sent to Wilson. The whistleblower said this was proof the regulator was colluding with the bank, but the FCA has denied this allegation. Townsend said although the copying and pasting was a \u201cvery unfortunate error\u201d by the FCA, he could find no evidence that the regulator had deliberately set out to mislead Wilson. Townsend said the FCA had failed to properly address Wilson\u2019s complaint, and told him that \u201cits attempt to shift blame on to you by suggesting you should have referred the matter to the Office of Fair Trading yourself was unacceptable\u201d. Townsend told Wilson it was essential that the new inquiry included \u201ca full analysis of the harm caused by the improper practices, including the number of customers affected and whether, as you allege, there is continuing overcharging\u201d. The failures in the handling both of your original complaint against HFC and HSBC and then your complaints against the regulators were serious,\u201d he added. \u201cThroughout, this matter has been characterised by delay and muddle. It cannot be satisfactory that the action which was eventually taken to investigate your concerns about HFC and HSBC only occurred because of your persistence; that the consideration of your complaint against the regulators was drawn out and badly handled; and that it was only following the lengthy inquiries, resulting from your complaint to me, that the FCA has now concluded it should reconsider its original decision. For all these matters, I recommend that the FCA offers a full apology for its serial failings.\u201d Wilson, who lives in East Sussex and used to work for a firm of solicitors, welcomed the ruling. It still doesn\u2019t mean they are going to take action, but at least it\u2019s out in the open now, and they can\u2019t bury it,\u201d he said. He claimed he reported what was happening to the bank 12 years ago and had subsequently \u201clost everything\u201d \u2013 he is unemployed, on benefits and his home may be repossessed. The FCA said: \u201cFollowing the complaints commissioner decision, the Financial Conduct Authority can confirm that it will reconsider its decision not to look into allegations made in relation to the debt collection practices of HFC Bank Limited. The FCA will be issuing an apology to the complainant shortly.\u201d HSBC said: \u201cWe will cooperate fully with any requests from the FCA on this matter.\u201d",

Temporary workers at the Shirebrook depot in Derbyshire are subjected to a \u201cstrike\u201d system, where they are sacked if they receive six marks \u2013 or \u201cstrikes\u201d \u2013 within a six-month period. Workers gain a strike for a variety of \u201coffences\u201d including \u201ca period of reported sickness\u201d, being \u201clate in/early out\u201d or \u201cusing a mobile phone in the warehouse\u201d. One local primary school headteacher said: \u201cYesterday one of our students was poorly, but they had come into school. The mum works at Sports Direct but had to go to work as she is on a zero hours contract and can\u2019t get any more work. We wanted to give the child medicine, but we couldn\u2019t get hold of the mum to get consent. These are the sorts of things that happen quite frequently. God forbid that a child had a serious accident, because we wouldn\u2019t be able to get hold of the parents. We would have to call the police to go into the warehouse.\u201d Another local primary school head, who had similar stories of not being able to contact parents working at Sports Direct, added: \u201cWe often find we have latchkey children. The parents are doing long shifts. We have had a nine-year-old child who has gone home at the end of the day, but the parents weren\u2019t there so the child came back to school. The parents are on zero-hours contracts and got asked to stay. They have to work.\u201d Other Sports Direct workers speak of suffering from depression after being abruptly sacked by the employment agencies used by the retailer, while Rev Keith Hebden, co-chair of Maun Valley Citizens, a local alliance of schools and faith groups, said: \u201cThe schools, churches, and other groups we work with in our alliance constantly talk of the problem of insecure and badly paid jobs in Mansfield with teenagers in my own church worried for the future of employment and parents at the gates talking about the hellish working conditions at Sports Direct. [Sports Direct founder] Mike Ashley needs to live up to the promises he made before he set up his sweatshop here and provide good jobs with living wages. God knows he can afford it.\u201d Fr Jonathan Cotton, parish priest at St Joseph\u2019s in Shirebrook, added: \u201cI know local people who are quite satisfied with their contract with Sports Direct and have been employed there for a number of years. And there are others, usually on a zero-hours basis, who are not always satisfied with the unpredictability of employment and the anxiety that this can cause, with bills to pay and mouths to feed, and the consequent health issues that this anxiety can cause.\u201d Sports Direct declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Transline employment agency said: \u201cWe are not aware of such instances and, as a reputable business, would urge anybody with concerns about child welfare to report these to the relevant authorities.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It may be 5.30am and pitch-black on the outskirts of Shirebrook, Derbyshire - but the roads are busy. A stream of cars, typically packed with eastern Europeans, wind their way along country lanes and deliver about 1,500 people to a massive facility surrounded by farmland. After stopping in an overflow car park, most shuffle silently across the road and into an illuminated 800,000sq ft structure that seems to emerge out of the darkness like a visitation in some bad science fiction film. The crowd clutches packed lunches that have been stuffed inside transparent plastic shopping bags, which allow hovering security guards to quickly inspect what is being brought inside. A fingerprint scanner grants access to the building through security barriers, while everybody remains under constant surveillance from cameras. If you are spotted wearing unauthorised clothing, you are immediately pulled aside by the guards. These security procedures are not designed to monitor people attempting to gain access to some secret organisation engaged in highly classified work \u2013 or even individuals visiting dangerous criminals. This is the routine grind for low-paid staff reporting for work on the nine-hour \u201cday shift\u201d at the warehouse of Sports Direct, the thriving sports retail empire founded and controlled by the billionaire owner of Newcastle United, Mike Ashley. The publicity-shy tycoon and his business have been widely criticised for the conditions at Shirebrook \u2013 known locally as \u201cthe gulag\u201d \u2013 where up to 5,000 staff clock in each day. It is hard to discern why the place is so maligned when you first arrive, but slowly the reason emerges. Step by step, minimum-wage workers are informed of what is expected of them for the headline rate of \u00a36.70 an hour (in reality, many receive less) \u2013 including being told they will walk almost 20 miles each day inside the warehouse as they pick products off the shelves. They can occasionally be harangued by name via tannoy if they don\u2019t move quickly enough \u2013 \u201cplease speed up with your order as soon as possible\u201d, the speaker system barks \u2013 while \u201ccrimes\u201d against the company \u2013 called \u201cstrikes\u201d and including \u201cerrors\u201d, \u201cexcessive/long toilet breaks\u201d, \u201ctime wasting\u201d, \u201cexcessive chatting\u201d, \u201chorseplay\u201d, \u201cwearing branded goods\u201d and \u201cusing a mobile phone in the warehouse\u201d \u2013 are punished. Six strikes in six months and you\u2019re out. There are other requirements, too. A daily search \u2013 part of Sports Direct\u2019s zero tolerance of theft \u2013 involves workers lining up before being ordered to strip to the final layer above the waist and empty their pockets. They are then asked to roll up their trouser legs to reveal the brands of their socks and expose the band of their underwear. Occasionally workers are hauled into a side room for a more detailed search. Agency workers are given a list of 802 sports and clothing brands they are prohibited from wearing. They include Sports Direct\u2019s own brands such as Dunlop, Slazenger, Karrimor, Sondico and Lonsdale as well as third-party labels including Nike, Adidas and Reebok. Despite these restrictions, the daily searches still take time and it seems to take most workers about 15 minutes to leave the building after their shift has ended. The extra time is unpaid. Few know details of the working practices at this successful retailer, as executives are extremely loyal to the company\u2019s founder and rarely speak publicly. Meanwhile, many agency workers, who have few rights and can be dismissed without notice, seem to exist in constant fear that any indiscretion could cost them their job. During November, the Guardian placed two undercover reporters inside the Shirebrook warehouse, as well as speaking to scores of current and past Sports Direct workers. The story that emerged shows Ashley refusing to increase productivity by investing in new technology. He believes productivity gains promised by the new technology are non-existent unless you know what products your warehouse will be handling years in advance. Instead, he focuses on building a retail machine whose cogs almost entirely consist of people: cheap people, typically from eastern Europe, who understand little, if any, English. To accommodate them, all signs and announcements inside the building are made in Polish as well as English. \u201cIt\u2019s voodoo retailing,\u201d says one former executive colleague of Ashley\u2019s. \u201cHe makes money out of financial engineering. The buying and manufacturing is very simple and done in the dumbest way possible. There is no complexity. Everything is bought as cheaply as possible. There is one warehouse, located in one of the cheapest places in the country, there is no sophisticated computer system. If you go to the Amazon warehouse it is all very automated. At Sports Direct it is very manual.\u201d The first thing that strikes you when entering the facility is its sheer scale. The main warehouse is the length of 13 Olympic swimming pools placed end-to-end \u2013 about 2,100ft long and 410ft wide. It houses row upon row of goods stacked in cardboard boxes, which in turn are perched on blue and orange metal shelving that rises more than 50ft into the air. There is another floor above. Next door a second warehouse of a similar size is being constructed, and life in both is relentless: Sports Direct operates its warehouses 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Inside, the workers \u2013 about 2,000 on the busiest shifts \u2013 buzz around wearing unbranded clothing, safety boots and various colours of high-visibility jackets. If you wear a white jacket, you are a new starter whose main aim is to avoid getting lost and receiving a rollicking. You get a yellow bib once you\u2019ve earned some stripes, typically after being there about a week; and, most importantly of all, there is a blue jacket for the bosses. \u201cJust do whatever the blue jackets tell you,\u201d new recruits are told on their first day. And you do exactly that \u2013 no matter how laborious or seemingly pointless the task. The nature and the tedium of the jobs on offer is illustrated at the rear of the facility, where rows of workers are engaged in what is known as \u201ctunnelling\u201d. Cages of garments are manually sorted, tossed onto tables corresponding to certain stores that are lettered A to N, or slipped on to coat-hangers and transferred to numbered rails for internet orders. The products are then inserted into polythene covers, on which the worker applies a sticker, before returning the item to the rail for somebody to wheel to another point in the warehouse. The rails are transferred up to the higher levels of the warehouse, where rows and rows of them are stored, waiting for the pickers to select the products to be dispatched. Apart from the \u201ctunnelling\u201d sorters, who use handheld scanners, the most cutting-edge piece of technology on display is a biro, which is used to mark up labels so colleagues know which rail the garment is heading for. These workers do this job for eight hours a day, some chatting away to each other eastern European languages and occasionally managing the odd word in English. \u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d grunts one young Romanian male, who appears built for heavier lifting. Meanwhile, another new Shirebrook recruit, who had previous experience of working in a more automated UK warehouse, was astonished at the scene: \u201cIt is all paper-based. There are no computers or anything.\u201d What these people may never guess \u2013 and are certainly never told \u2013 is that they are providing Sports Direct with one of the retailer\u2019s key competitive advantages: a process whose outcome is so valuable it is envied by at least one of the country\u2019s most respected retail veterans. It is a system that quickly reroutes products that are not selling in some Sports Direct stores to outlets where those items are being bought, or to the online store. So \u201ctunnelling\u201d means Sports Direct can stock its shops with more products that sell, while keeping overall stock, re-ordering and unwanted discounting down. There is clever computer code working out where every product should be sent \u2013 all written by Ashley\u2019s brother John \u2013 but it is hard to see how this key system could possibly work without lots of cheap labour doing menial jobs. Yet while the work is basic, the pressure to perform feels intense. Back in the main warehouse, the pickers are handed sheets listing rows of products they need to fetch and place into their stillage \u2013 a metal cage on wheels for transporting goods around the warehouse. Pickers are given an \u201cestimated finishing time\u201d for this task, which is virtually impossible to hit without running down the aisles. The picking list is scanned at the start of a session, and then again at the end, so managers can see how long employees are taking. Every employee\u2019s performance is published on league tables outside the staff canteen \u2013 showing what percentage of their target they have achieved next to their name. The best performing employees are listed in the \u201cpremier league\u201d. The constant monitoring is justified as a reasonable way of ensuring workers don\u2019t slack off. \u201cThere is nothing to worry about,\u201d says one \u201cblue jacket\u201d. \u201cThe targets are just there for the gabbers.\u201d Yet later that day the same boss takes a different view on the pressures of Shirebrook, when overheard talking to a peer. \u201cI get the blame for everything,\u201d he moans. \u201cFor attendance, for performance.\u201d Literature handed to new starters by employment agency The Best Connection makes the culture clear. \u201cYour performance onsite will be monitored and if you do not meet the expectations of Sports Direct then your assignment will be terminated,\u201d its welcome letter states. Transline\u2019s literature is more succinct still: \u201cTransline reserves the right to end an assignment at any time without reason, notice or liability.\u201d The result seems to be a workforce afraid of the sack \u2013 but also afraid to quit and seek a job elsewhere. \u201cPeople won\u2019t leave because they don\u2019t think they will find anything else. Most of the Polish people who work there don\u2019t speak a word of English,\u201d says one eastern European worker. \u201cEveryone\u2019s afraid of the [employment agency] office. As soon as you go into the office you think they are probably going to sack you.\u201d That office, perched in an elevated room overlooking the warehouse at the centre of the facility, houses the employment agency bosses. They can\u2019t see everything from there, but it feels as though they can, and workers have to file past them as they make their way to one of the staff canteens for each of their two 30-minute breaks. In this case, the term \u201ccanteen\u201d is possibly too grand. The room, about the size of a local authority swimming pool, contains rows of picnic tables lined with workers, most of whom bring their own food rather than use the vending machines at both ends of the room, or another canteen that serves hot food. Stacked in wire shelving are the packed lunches in transparent shopping bags. At the start of each break workers snap open large plastic containers and wolf down spoonfuls of cold pasta and meat. Some then file out to one of the smoking terraces. Amid the low hum of gloomy conversation in foreign languages, thoughts always seem to be drifting back to work. Workers are warned that if they clock in one minute late \u2013 or clock off one minute early \u2013 they will be docked 15 minutes\u2019 pay. Some even wait by the screens for the precise moment their break is due to start before clocking off, despite being warned that this is considered a cardinal sin. \u201cIf they see you waiting to clock out, you can get into a lot of trouble,\u201d says one coordinator. And yet, the system does not quite work the same the other way around. Clock out late \u2013 even if you have been finishing a job \u2013 and there is no extra pay. Meanwhile, workers are also not allowed to leave the warehouse at the end of their shifts until they have been searched. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying,\u201d says one worker waiting in the queue to leave, \u201cespecially after a nine-hour shift.\u201d At that point it is back out through the security barriers and into the overflow car park to share a lift home. You are drained, yet 14 hours later, you return to do the same thing. And you dread it.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has said the number of cars with irregular carbon dioxide levels is far lower than originally feared, providing some much-needed respite for the beleaguered German carmarker. The company warned last month that CO2 emissions levels and fuel consumption figures may have been rigged in 800,000 cars. However, VW now believes that only about 36,000 vehicles are affected. Shares in VW, which have fallen by 30% since the emissions scandal emerged in September, rose by almost 5% in Germany on Wednesday following the news. The dramatic admission that VW may have rigged CO2 emissions as well as diesel emissions threatened to significantly escalate the crisis at the company. It is already facing the prospect of having to pay tens of billions of euros in fines and compensation after admitting rigging diesel emissions levels in 11m vehicles worldwide. The news about CO2 emissions damaged consumer confidence in the brand further and raised the possibility that VW could have to repay tax credits customers had benefited from by driving cars that emitted more CO2 than it claimed. VW estimated the \u201ceconomic risks\u201d of the CO2 discovery at \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.45bn), but said on Wednesday that it was too early to lower this estimate until more was known about the scale of the emissions rigging. In a statement, the carmaker said: \u201cOnly a small number of the model variants of new cars will have the catalogue (CO2) figure slightly adjusted. \u201cAgainst this background, the negative impact on earnings of \u20ac2bn that was originally expected has not been confirmed. Whether we will have a minor economic impact depends on the results of the remeasurement exercise.\u201d The company is scheduled to provide a thorough update on the investigation into the scandal at its Wolfsburg headquarters on Thursday, when VW will also outline plans to cut costs to offset the fines and compensation claims it faces.",

      "bodyText": "After two days of hefty losses in the wake of a \u00a3285m debt refinancing last week, TV distributor and film business Entertainment One has regained some of the lost ground. The company had seen a number of negative comments about the cost of the refinancing from analysts, prompting its shares to lose around a third of their value in just two trading sessions. But they are currently the biggest riser in the FTSE 250, up 15.1p or nearly 11% to 156p after the Peppa Pig owner issued a statement saying it continued to trade in line with expectations and playing down concerns about the refinancing. It said: [The refinancing] provides the company with a long term capital structure appropriate for its strategic ambitions. In addition [it] permits greater flexibility by relieving constraints and costs the company historically suffered when undertaking acquisitions and other corporate activity, and allows the company to react swiftly to commercial opportunities. It said it was confident of doubling the size of the company by 2020 by strong organic growth as well as acquisitions. Broker Peel Hunt, which on Tuesday cut its rating on the shares from hold to reduce has now issued a buy note. Analyst Malcolm Morgan said: In response to the share price fall Entertainment One has this morning reiterated the detail of the refinancing. The flexibility of the covenant-light loan is being paid for by sharply higher interest cost. We leave our target price unchanged but expect the share price to rise after the aggressive falls that have happened as the market digested another earnings per share reduction so soon after the interims and the dilutive rights issue. The recovery may have been helped by news that chief executive Darren Throop bought 130,675 shares on Tuesday at 140.37p each.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is on alert for the reaction in financial markets to an anticipated rise in US interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. Threadneedle Street identified flows in and out of emerging markets as one area which was difficult to predict in the event of a rise by the US Federal Reserve at its meeting on 15 and 16 December. Janet Yellen, chair of the Fed, hinted last week that a rate rise was likely this month. The Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee \u2013 set up to look for risks in the financial system \u2013 said there could be risks to stability from banks\u2019 exposure to debt in emerging markets. \u201cCapital flows had been sensitive to diverging prospects for monetary policy around the world and there was a risk of further volatility in capital flows as that policy divergence progressed. Though the likelihood of a tightening in policy by US policymakers was widely expected, the market reaction to any decision by the FOMC to increase interest rates remained difficult to predict,\u201d the record of the latest quarterly meeting of the FPC said. \u201cGiven the size of UK banks\u2019 exposures to emerging market economies, there were likely to be risks to UK financial stability associated with the rapid buildup in emerging market debt,\u201d the FPC said. This is why it had incorporated a slowdown in emerging markets in to its annual stress tests of major lenders. The results of those stress tests were announced last week and found that Standard Chartered and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland had the weakest financial positions of the seven lenders assessed. At the time, the Bank also flagged it was monitoring the buy-to-let mortgage market. The record of the meeting that led to last week\u2019s announcement lists the main risks to financial stability as emerging market economies, financial market fragility, property markets, the UK \u2019s current account deficit and cybercrime. It also provides more detail about last week\u2019s announcement that banks may be required to hold a special capital cushion of up to \u00a310bn to guard against any economic downturn through what are known as counter cyclical capital buffers. These buffers are currently set at 0% but could be raised at the next FPC meeting in March. Some members of the FPC, which is chaired by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, had argued that the case for raising the buffer could be made soon. \u201cIn the view of some members, it was too soon to consider an increase in capital buffers on UK exposures. Though overall credit growth had increased it remained below that of nominal GDP and below pre-crisis averages. Some members had judged the UK corporate sector to have been more risk averse recently and conditions in capital markets to have tightened, with some spreads more elevated than historical averages. In the view of other members, however, there could be a case for such an overall increase soon,\u201d the record said. On cybercrime, the Bank said and \u201cattack was a serious and growing threat to the resilience of the UK financial system\u201d. \u201cIn the context of elevated geopolitical risks, the FPC emphasised the importance both of strengthening resilience to cyber attacks and of market participants having robust contingency planning arrangements in place that were regularly tested and updated to reflect current threats,\u201d the Bank said.",

      "bodyText": "As leading shares slip back once more on concerns about the continuing commodity rout, one exception is Ashtead. The equipment rental hire group has recently been hit by concerns about its exposure to the oil and gas sector, where companies have been cutting back investment as the crude price slides. But after a reassuring update, the shares have added 84p or more than 8% to \u00a311.15. The company reported a 21% rise in half year profits and said its full year results were now likely to be ahead of expectations, thanks to strong demand from the US. According to Reuters, analysts had been expecting annual profits of around \u00a3608m. Analysts at Peel Hunt said: The shares have suffered from fears over oil and gas exposure and recent peer comments. We feel that this has been overplayed and today\u2019s statement should reassure. Ashtead remains a quality \u2018growth cyclical\u2019 and, with its improving returns profile (2016 estimated return on capital employed of 25%), we remain positive. Investec was also upbeat: Another positive update from the group, with the 2016 results expected to be ahead of previous expectations. Encouragingly, capex guidance has been increased to \u00a31.1bn (from \u00a31.0bn), indicating confidence in future growth. We continue to believe Ashtead remains very well placed to benefit from the ongoing recovery in in its core US construction markets, alongside secular growth. Much has been made of Oil &amp; Gas exposure and peer group trading; today\u2019s results should help dilute some of these concerns. Ahead of results next week Dixons Carphone has climbed 6.6p to 485.9p, helped by a positive note from Barclays: We expect a robust set of figures next week with the UK printing a positive like for like performance in the second quarter despite the very tough comps, which would have been unthinkable of a couple of months ago. Dixons Carphone continues to gain market share aggressively both in mobile and electricals in the UK in a market that printed another record Black Friday growth, according to Barclaycard data (up 9.9%). We expect Dixons Carphone to be a major beneficiary while maintaining good margin control as many of the deals should have been supported and agreed with major suppliers, testament to the good relationships the company has. While first half results will cover the six months to October we would be surprised if we don\u2019t hear comments, even qualitative ones, on Black Friday week trading. We are less optimistic about the Nordics and Southern Europe in the second quarter but we expect significant sales growth acceleration in the second half. But overall the FTSE 100 is down 13.15 points at 6122.07, with mining groups under pressure once more as iron ore edged lower once more. Among the other fallers publishing group Pearson has dropped 22.5p to 741.5p after Deutsche Bank issued a sell note and cut its price target from 950p to 770p. The bank said: We think Pearson\u2019s problems are structural, with cyclical pressures exacerbating them. The challenges are most acute in US College (approximately 35% profits) and where a reduction in margin to the level of the school business would negatively impact profits by 15%. Over time, we think the education market is becoming more competitive, as the old print-based oligopolies are challenged by free content and new entrants. Elsewhere Stagecoach has slid 49.5p to 306.6p after the rail and bus group said customers had cut back on journeys to big cities following last month\u2019s terror attacks in Paris. Still with transport and Go-Ahead Group is down 92p to \u00a326.02 after failing to win the TransPennine Express and Northern rail franchises.

The company reported a 21% rise in half year profits and said its full year results were now likely to be ahead of expectations, thanks to strong demand from the US.

We feel that this has been overplayed and today\u2019s statement should reassure.

Encouragingly, capex guidance has been increased to \u00a31.1bn (from \u00a31.0bn), indicating confidence in future growth.

Reporting first-half results, the company said discretionary journeys to London, Paris and Brussels had fallen significantly since the terrorist attacks on 13 November. Its British business had also been badly affected by the recent floods, and the company said it had made a modest reduction to its expectations for full-year earnings, without giving details. Martin Griffiths, chief executive of Stagecoach, said: \u201cThere has undoubtedly been an impact from the terrible events in Paris. It\u2019s starting to come back but we need to be cautious about the rest of the year. It\u2019s mainly London [in the UK] and we have an intercity coach business in continental Europe which mainly serves big capital cities.\u201d In its East Midlands Trains business, revenue rose by about 8% in the two months before the attacks but growth disappeared in the two weeks after. Business at the service, which runs trains from Leicester, Derby and other east Midlands cities to London St Pancras, is starting to pick up again, Griffiths said. Thomas Cook and easyJet have reported a fall in flight bookings in and out of France after the Paris attacks, but Stagecoach has now reported travel affected within the UK. Like Griffiths, the bosses of Thomas Cook and easyJet said they believed business would pick up again as fears receded. Pre-tax profit excluding exceptional items for the six months to the end of October rose 12% to \u00a3121.5m and the interim dividend increased 9.4% to 3.5p. Statutory pre-tax profit fell to \u00a390.8m from \u00a398.3m. Stagecoach\u2019s shares fell as much as 15% and were down 14% at 305.8p at 9.30am as investors reacted to the impact of the Paris attacks and various other pressures on its operations. Griffiths said Stagecoach\u2019s bus service in Cumbria and the north-west of England, which makes \u00a340m a year in revenues, was \u201cunder water\u201d and that its business in Scotland had also been affected by the recent floods. Scottish operations have also been hit by the closure of the Forth road bridge, he added. In the UK, bus services had been affected by congestion in cities such as Manchester and Oxford and long-distance bus revenues were reduced as car use rose following the fall in the oil price. In the US, long distance bus revenues felt a greater impact from reduced petrol prices and the strong dollar has deterred tourists from Europe, creating competition on bus routes from airports and to out-of-town discount outlets used by shoppers visiting the US.",

      "bodyText": "Anglo American shares have dropped sharply for the second day running, as investors flee the company following its plans to suspend its dividend and dispose of more than half its mines in a response to the slump in commodity prices. Anglo said on Tuesday it would sell or close up to 35 mines and cut employee and contractor numbers from 135,000 to fewer than 50,000 after 2017. The drastic action follows the fall in the price of key commodities, notably iron ore which has dropped around 40% this year as global economic growth slows and demand from China declines. But analysts fear it may not be enough to cope with its debt levels. Anglo\u2019s shares fell more than 12% on Tuesday after its announcement, and has now dropped another 13% or 41.55p to 282.1p, again the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. That marks a near 24% decline in less than a day and a half, and a \u00a31.2bn slide since the announcement. So far this year, Anglo\u2019s shares have lost more than 76%. The company has fared worse than many rivals due to its reliance on iron ore, which is one of the worst hit commodities in the current rout. Analysts remain concerned that if the iron ore price remained at these low levels for any extended period, the company\u2019s actions may not be enough to resolve its debt issues, with a rights issue seen as a possiblity. Credit Suisse said: In our view the company has a 12 month window to execute on sales and improve cash flows; otherwise pressure on debt levels and raising equity will increase further. At UBS, Myles Allsop said: In our opinion, the balance sheet concerns are... likely to remain until commodity prices improve or net debt is reduced... Anglo flags there is a risk the Kumba [subsidiary] will breach its debt covenants in 2016 if iron ore remains below $40 a tonne. Canaccord Genuity said: In difficult markets, the company is trying to accelerate its restructuring and enhance its balance sheet. The challenge remains substantial. When commodity prices do recover, the share price recovery could be significant, but in the meantime investors should remain wary.

The train operators will work closely with the region\u2019s newly established transport body, Rail North, as the government pledges more devolution alongside a transformation of the rail network, despite delays to promised electrification work. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: \u201cAs a one nation government we are committed to closing the economic gap between north and south. This deal, and the joint management of the franchises, will bring the northern powerhouse to life. \u201cArriva Rail North Limited and First Trans Pennine Express Limited went far beyond our requirements with exciting, ambitious plans that will make a real difference to customers, and \u2013 coupled with our commitment to push ahead with electrifying the vital Transpennine route \u2013 will help the region realise its full economic potential, ensuring it has a modern 21st century transport system. This is fantastic news for the north.\u201d Rail upgrades have become a totemic issue for the government and the chancellor, George Osborne, in particular, after he put a proposed high-speed network in the north at the heart of his vision for a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d. But the pledges were undermined by the shelving of promised electrification schemes, which have been officially restarted \u2013 if delayed \u2013 after a review published alongside the autumn statement. The decision to enforce the removal of Pacer trains was taken in an explicit ministerial direction by McLoughlin in February, overruling advice from civil servants that it would represent poor value for public money, saying that \u201cuncomfortable and low quality\u201d vehicles were having a negative impact on rail\u2019s reputation. Arriva will increase capacity by 40% across its northern network, including a higher-quality Northern Connect service on longer-distance routes. It will also significantly boost Sunday services in the north. Chris Burchell, the managing director of Arriva\u2019s UK Trains division, said: \u201cWe will be investing more than \u00a31bn to deliver a step-change in quality for customers and dramatically improving services, stations, information and ticketing. Our aim is to be the communities\u2019 local railway and to leave a positive lasting legacy for the north of England.\u201d Winning the TransPennine franchise outright will be an important boost for First Group, whose fortunes have faltered in recent years, not least since having the lucrative west coast franchise slip away in the 2012 bidding fiasco. First will bring in 220 new carriages, equivalent to 44 trains, and worth more than \u00a3400m, providing 125mph services across the network, as well as introducing new and additional services for Scotland, including a direct Liverpool to Glasgow service from December 2018. It has also promised discounted advance fares for 16- to 18-year-olds and jobseekers. Tim O\u2019Toole, the chief executive of FirstGroup, said: \u201cOur plans include investment in new and refurbished trains on every part of the network, with millions more seats available, free Wi-Fi and simpler smart and mobile ticketing, allowing us to build on the success we have had over the past 11 years, in which we have more than doubled passenger journeys on the network.\u201d First will pay \u00a3303m in premiums to the government over the course of the franchise. Arriva will receive a total subsidy of \u00a31.79bn, a reduction on the current deal with Abellio.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of UK visa applications by wealthy foreigners has collapsed after the government doubled the required investment threshold from \u00a31m to \u00a32m late last year. In the first nine months of 2015, there were just 136 applications for \u201ctier one\u201d investor visas, for which residents from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland can apply provided they have access to at least \u00a32m in investment funds. This compares with 780 applications over the same period last year, an 83% decrease. The number of visa applications under the tier one investor scheme had previously increased every year from 180 applications in 2009, the first full year in which the scheme was in operation, to a record 1,290 applications in 2014. The 2014 peak in applications was partly driven by more than 510 applications received in the final quarter of 2014, almost four times the number received in the first nine months of this year. The drop in applications has been particularly marked among Chinese and Russian investors. In the last three months of 2014 alone, there were 295 applications from China compared with just 20 recorded in the first six months of 2015. Similarly, there were 65 applications from Russia between 1 October and 31 December 2014 compared with just 20 between January and June of this year. London\u2019s property market has experienced a similar drop this year in investments from Russia and Asia, which once made up a third of those buying property in the capital\u2019s wealthiest areas. The Home Office gave no official reason for doubling the investment threshold to \u00a32m. However, a source close to the policy said the change was mainly due to upward pressure on property prices. In addition to the change in the tier one visa rules, the fall in numbers from both countries is likely to have also been influenced by the slowing of Russia and China\u2019s economies and the weakening of their currencies against the British pound. Sergey Litovchenko, an associate at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: \u201cThe level of the investment required for a Russian national to apply for a tier one visa has increased four times in comparison to pre-November 2014. GBP to rouble exchange rate has gone up from 50 rouble to \u00a31, to 100 rouble to \u00a31, and the level of the minimum investment increased from \u00a31m to \u00a32m.\u201d The UK government has recently launched more stringent criminal checks on the people applying for investment visas which, according to several experts, will have also contributed to the drop in applications. Josephine Goube, director of partnerships at Migreat, an online platform providing visa information and guidance: \u201cBefore April 2015, UK banks used the fact that individuals were granted a UK investor visa as a qualifying evidence to overcome due diligence concerns when assessing the individual\u2019s legitimacy. Criminal checks have only been implemented from this September 2015.\u201d This view is shared by Litovchenko, who added that there was now increased competition for high net worth migrants from countries such as Malta, which offer very competitive routes to obtaining an EU nationality and passport. A breakdown of the nationalities of the 3,340 applications to the scheme between its introduction in June 2008 and the end of June 2015 show that Chinese people accounted for 37% (1,220) of applicants. A fifth of all applications were made by Russian residents (705), followed by citizens of the US (205) and the United Arab Emirates (170), according to data published under the Freedom of Information Act. Between June 2008 and June 2015, almost 91% of processed applications were granted, 8% were refused while the remainder were withdrawn or lapsed. Up until late last year, applicants needed to have access to at least \u00a31m in investment funds to apply. However, under new rules introduced in November 2014 the minimum threshold was increased to \u00a32m, excluding investment in companies mainly engaged in property investment, property management or property development.

    "webTitle": "Recovery 'too reliant on consumer debt' as BCC downgrades forecast", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economic recovery remains too reliant on debt-fuelled consumer spending, a leading UK business organisation has warned, as it downgraded its growth forecasts in the face of a manufacturing slowdown. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said on Wednesday that it expected economic growth for this year to be 2.4%, down from the 2.6% it was expecting three months ago; and for 2016 its forecast has been revised to 2.5%, down from 2.7%. The downgrade came after official figures revealed that manufacturers cut back production by 0.4% in October, partly reversing a strong performance the previous month, and underlining warnings of a tough winter for the sector. Official figures published on Tuesday showed that while George Osborne has pledged to unleash a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d, manufacturing output in October stood 0.1% lower than the same month in 2014 \u2013 and remains 6.1% below its pre-recession peak. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the renewed weakness of industry suggested Britain\u2019s recovery would continue to rely on the dominant services sector. \u201cWhat is clear is that fourth-quarter GDP growth is once again going to be highly dependent on the services sector,\u201d he said. John Longworth, the BCC\u2019s director general, commenting on its more pessimistic forecasts, said: \u201cWe cannot rely so heavily on consumer spending to fuel our economy, especially when driven by increased borrowing. We have been down this path before, and know that it leaves individuals and businesses exposed when interest rates do eventually rise.\u201d He added that recent weak trade data showed that the economic recovery has been unbalanced \u2013 too dependent on consumers, instead of exports and business investment. \u201cThe UK still needs to see a fundamental shift in its economic model if we are to remain relevant and prosperous in a changing world economy.,\u201d he said. The BCC, whose member firms employ more than 5 million staff, has also pushed back its expectation for the first rise in official interest rates by three months, to the third quarter of 2016. Bank of England policymakers have held rates at their record low of 0.5% since March 2009. The BCC now expects borrowing costs to rise gradually over the next two years, to reach 1.75% by the end of 2017. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, which has the job of preventing a future crash, warned that it is looking closely at the rapid growth of credit in the economy and considering cracking down on rampant buy-to-let lending to prevent a bubble. Separately, the ONS said overall industrial production, which includes mining and utilities, as well as manufacturing, increased just 0.1% in October on the previous month, to a level 1.7% higher than a year earlier; but economists pointed out that the rise was driven by a sharp swing in gas output. \u201cIndustrial production only edged up in October due to erratic movements in its volatile components,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Pantheon Macro. \u201cThe 0.4% month-to-month fall in core manufacturing output is another sign that the strong pound is starting to stifle the economic recovery, and the continued weakness of the manufacturing surveys suggest further falls lie ahead.\u201d The manufacturing body EEF has warned that conditions in the sector are tough, with the recent appreciation of sterling and the slowdown in emerging economies such as China undermining demand. The continued weakness of commodity prices has also hit industry, with many firms reliant on supplying or servicing the North Sea oil sector. Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, said: \u201cLooking forward, industry will remain under pressure from the low oil price and weak export demand flowing from slower growth in emerging markets.\u201d The ONS said manufacture of some types of machinery and equipment had been the biggest contributor to the decline in output, while other sectors, including pharmaceuticals, had performed more strongly. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research thinktank also issued its latest GDP forecasts on Tuesday after the industrial output data was published. NIESR now expects GDP growth to be 0.6% in the three months ending in November, up from 0.5% in the three months ending October. \u201cThis rate of growth is consistent with the continued absorption of spare capacity in the UK economy and our own view that the Bank of England is most likely to begin to increase rates in February 2016,\u201d it said in a statement.",
