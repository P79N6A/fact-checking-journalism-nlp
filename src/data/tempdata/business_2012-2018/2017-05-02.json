      "bodyText": "Leaving the European Union without a trade deal in place could put up to 97% of British food and drink exports at risk, according to a House of Lords report that lays bare the agricultural industry\u2019s overwhelming reliance on local markets. As negotiations between the EU and British government appear to take a turn for worse, concerns are growing that failure to reach an exit deal could leave many industries facing steep tariff barriers in future \u2013 something government ministers hope could be offset by opportunities in other international export markets. The latest Lords report on the implications of Brexit exposes particularly high dependency on the single market and associated EU trade deals among British farmers and food manufacturers. Evidence to the Lords EU energy and environment subcommittee revealed the interconnected nature of much food and drink production that would be threatened by non-tariff barriers. \u201cIf you take one example \u2013 a bottle of Baileys Irish Cream \u2026 if you are a Northern Irish cow, your milk crosses the border five times before it goes into the bottle,\u201d said Ian Wright, director general of the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). \u201cThe idea that that would be subject to tariffs hither and yon is really very scary.\u201d The production of many baked goods could similarly be vulnerable to disruption as raw ingredients such as flour cross EU borders several times before cakes and confectionery appear on supermarket shelves. It is the impact on farmers that is giving peers most cause for concern, and the report warns of a possible quadruple whammy from Brexit as they lose access to EU farm subsidies, European export markets, access to European workers and protection from a cheap imports from outside the EU. \u201cPost-Brexit, the UK\u2019s agriculture and food sectors face enormous challenges,\u201d said Robin Teverson, the chair of the committee. \u201cLife after the EU\u2019s common agricultural policy will not be easy for the many UK farmers who rely on its financial support.\u201d In other evidence to the committee, Peter Hardwick, head of exports at the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, a statutory industry body, said: \u201cIf we look at our agricultural exports, they are currently very dependent on trade with the European Union and, on average, about 80% of our agricultural exports go to the European Union.\u201d Trade data analysed by the FDF found equally strong ties when finished consumer products were included in the total. It found 70% of food and drink exports went to EU member states, and a further 27% to countries that have a free trade agreement with the EU. There are 27 such agreements in place, covering 38 countries ranging from Turkey to Morocco to Canada, and the Lords investigation concluded that most of these would lapse once Britain left the EU and would need to be separately renegotiated for exporters to continue to benefit from low tariffs. Instead, the only access guaranteed in the event of no new trade deals being struck would stem from Britain\u2019s membership of the World Trade Organisation, which has particularly punitive tariffs for many agricultural goods \u2013 rising to 30% for much of the dairy industry. Lord Teverson said the trade numbers were \u201cstaggering\u201d and revealed \u201chow totally dependent we are on the EU for our export markets in these animal and food process products\u201d. The committee\u2019s report says patchy trade data has previously masked the scale of intra-European trade, particularly as traffic through ports makes precise measurement difficult. Teverson said the impact of Brexit, particularly for sheep, pork and cattle producers, would soon begin to sink in. \u201cAll those issues will come about as soon as the negotiations start. At that point a lot of this will become live,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen, the government itself might not wish to give a running commentary but you can bet your life there is going to be a running commentary from the other side. Real issues will start to come through.\u201d The government insists it is still confident of striking a comprehensive new free trade agreement with the EU as well as many new bilateral deals that can replace and expand those already in place. It has also guaranteed to match farm support payments for a limited period. The Lords report calls for an extensive transition period for farmers to adjust to the host of new challenges on the horizon. \u201cFarmers risk high tariffs and non-tariff barriers on exports, which would render their business uncompetitive, while simultaneously having to adjust to a new UK policy for funding,\u201d the study concludes. \u201cThis could have detrimental effects on an industry \u2013 and rural communities \u2013 which needs long-term clarity and policy stability to adjust to the post-Brexit policy environment.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel has completed the \u00a3100m sale of its speciality steels business to Liberty House, safeguarding 1,700 jobs and creating 300 more in the north of England. The deal secures the future of five UK sites in Rotherham, Stocksbridge and Brinsworth in south Yorkshire, as well as smaller sites in Bolton, Lancashire, and Wednesbury in the West Midlands. It also includes two distribution centres in China. Liberty House, the metals company run by tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, said it would invest up to \u00a320m in new plant and equipment over the next year to boost competitiveness and overseas growth. Gupta said the deal represented \u201ca big vote of confidence in the future of British industry\u201d. He added: \u201cWith the right business model and an innovative approach, the UK steel and engineering sectors can recover and thrive. The government is now pursuing a new post-Brexit industrial strategy and steel must be at the heart of that strategy. \u201cThe speciality steels business is a global leader in its field, with a highly-skilled and well-motivated workforce and we are eager to invest so it can grow and achieve its full potential.\u201d The additional 300 roles will be production jobs at the south Yorkshire sites. Liberty said it would increase output significantly at the electric arc furnaces, casting shop and bar mill in Rotherham, with \u201cbigger plans\u201d across the wider business in the coming years. Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of Community, the steelworkers\u2019 trade union, welcomed the deal: \u201cThe completion of the sale will bring some welcome certainty to a workforce that has faced a tough time over recent months and years. It demonstrates that with the right vision there are opportunities for the UK steel industry to grow.\u201d Tony Brady, the national officer at the union Unite, said the deal brought to an end \u201cmonths of agonising uncertainty\u201d for workers. \u201cThis is a workforce which has done everything asked of them over the last few years to give speciality steelmaking a fighting chance in the UK. Liberty House\u2019s commitments on jobs and new investment are a welcome recognition of the skills of a dedicated workforce.\u201d India\u2019s Tata put the business up for sale last year after reviewing its struggling UK operations, which also include Britain\u2019s largest steelworks in Port Talbot, south Wales. Bimlendra Jha, the chief executive of Tata Steel in the UK, said the company had invested in the specialist steels business in recent years, giving it a \u201csustainable future\u201d. The business will be known as Liberty Speciality Steels, with Jon Boulton appointed as chief executive. The acquisition makes Liberty one of the biggest steel and engineering employers in the UK with more than 4,500 workers. Boulton has about 30 years\u2019 experience in the steel industry and joined Liberty in early 2016. He said he was confident about future prospects for the newly acquired business: \u201cThrough increased output and improved positions in the UK, North American and EU markets, the business can improve its competitiveness and re-establish itself as a global force in the supply of engineering steels. \u201cWe will be running the business with greater focus and a strong vision and will be capitalising on recent investment in state-of-the-art steel-making facilities to strengthen our position in technically challenging markets.\u201d Tata is in talks with the Pension Regulator to try and find a solution for its troubled pension scheme, necessary to secure the future of its UK operations, which employs about 8,500 workers.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "English winemakers are reporting \u201ccatastrophic\u201d crop damage after the worst frost in a generation wiped out at least half of this year\u2019s grape harvest. Chris White, the chief executive of Denbies Wine Estate in Surrey, said up to 75% of its crop was damaged by last week\u2019s sub-zero temperatures: \u201cThe temperature dropped to -6C and at that level it causes catastrophic damage to buds,\u201d he said. White said staff had worked in vain using special fans and heaters to protect the vineyard, which at 265 acres in the UK\u2019s biggest, after an Arctic blast swept across the UK. \u201cWe are very disappointed and it\u2019s quite heartbreaking for the people who work in the vineyard all year round,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom what I hear the majority of English vineyards have been affected to some degree.\u201d Some of France\u2019s most famous winemaking regions, including Champagne, Bordeaux and Burgundy, were also affected by last week\u2019s severe frosts. The bad weather is expected to mean another poor year for French producers after last year\u2019s cocktail of hail, frost and mildew resulted in one of the smallest harvests in 30 years. The blow dealt to this year\u2019s wine harvest is a setback for an industry enjoying huge success, with Denbies, Nyetimber and Ridgeview among the South Downs vintners winning international acclaim for sparkling \u2013 and increasingly still \u2013 wine produced in an area that has a geology and microclimate similar to Champagne. It also comes after four record years, a strong run that has encouraged the industry to plan a record 1m vines over the next 12 months. The number of acres planted with grapevines in England and Wales has already more than doubled to about 5,000 acres over the past 10 years with two big French champagne houses, Taittinger and Vranken-Pommery Monopole, among those investing in English wine projects. Chris Foss, head of the wine department at Plumpton College in East Sussex, said he had contacted vineyard owners around the south-east to gauge the bad weather\u2019s impact on this year\u2019s harvest and while some crops were unscathed others had been \u201cdecimated\u201d with 90% of buds destroyed. One grower described it as the \u201cworst frost since 1997\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been in English wine for 30 years and never seen anything like it,\u201d said Foss. \u201cIt looks like there will be a 50% drop in this year\u2019s expected yield \u2013 if not higher.\u201d The length of the winemaking process means the supply squeeze will not become apparent to wine drinkers until 2018 when this year\u2019s still wines are released and 2020 for sparkling wine. Nick Wenman, who owns the Albury organic vineyard in Surrey, said the devastating cold snap had been the biggest setback he had faced since planting the vineyard eight years ago. Despite lighting 500 candles and burners to warm the air, 80% of its vines were damaged by the freezing temperatures. \u201cIt\u2019s been a stark reminder of the difficulties faced by wine producers in the country, and yes \u2026 at this moment we are asking ourselves whether we were mad to try and grow vines in England,\u201d said Wenman who is trying to look on the bright side. \u201cSome buds have escaped altogether and the damaged vines should develop secondary buds \u2026 whilst these may not be as fruitful or have as much time to ripen, they give us hope for a harvest this year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Despite a raft of uncertainties - Apple\u2019s results later on, the two day US Federal Reserve meeting, US jobs data on Friday, the continuing concerns over Brexit and this weekend\u2019s final round of the French election - European markets maintained a calm tone throughout the day. Sentiment was helped by the agreed deal between Greece and its creditors as well as positive results from the likes of BP and pharmaceuticals group Shire. In the US, Wall Street shrugged off a poor set of car sales figures for April. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: UK and European markets have put in a decent performance this afternoon, which is perhaps ironic given the public falling out between London and Brussels over the weekend, but in the US all is calm, and not just in a \u2018pre-Apple results\u2019 sense of the word. Across markets the talk is of how the volatility index is at multi-year lows; like many much-lauded indicators in technical analysis, this piece of fundamental data will be used in defence of both the bullish and the bearish case. The latter will argue that this state of affairs cannot go on, and that something has to give, while the former will point out that it is reflective of the resilience of this bull market, and that investor flows into equities will mean that this state of affairs will persist for a while yet. With a Fed meeting, non-farm payrolls and the all-important second presidential round in France to come over the next few days, the Vix could well move higher, but I suspect its low level will remain a favourite theme throughout 2017. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 46.11 points or 0.64% at 7250.05 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.56% to 12,507.90 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.7% at 5304.15 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.6% to 20,733.25 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.98% better at 10,820.3 In Greece, the Athens market jumped more than 3% to 733.93 following the country\u2019s deal with its creditors On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 31 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Not everyone is convinced that Greece\u2019s problems have been resolved by this latest deal: After the first 100 days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, what next? Economist Rob Carnell and his colleagues at ING Bank have been looking ahead to the next 100 days. They say: The first 100 days of Trump have been clouded with regime uncertainty, which has seen markets temper their reflation optimism. But in the absence of a spike in global risk aversion, we see enough supportive factors to prevent a full post-election unwind. Looking at the next 100 days of Trump, there are two reasons why we think this could be as good as it gets for the dollar: (1) a more watered-down Trump policy regime and (2) real interest rates in the US staying lower for longer. One of the major issues facing investors is determining which Trump policy paradigm will prevail over the next 100 days. The reality is that all possibilities remain on the table. To shed some clarity, we present four paths that we think global markets could take over the course of 2017. And here they are: And here is what is coming up in terms of US policy: The Dow has come off its best levels, up just 5 points now after disappointing April car sales from the likes of Ford and General Motors. As the US Federal Reserve begins its latest two day monetary policy meeting, Wall Street has opened higher, with Nasdaq hitting another new record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 37 points or 0.19% while the Nasdaq Composite opened 0.15% higher and the S&amp;P 500 added 0.17%. Apple\u2019s shares edged higher to another peak ahead of its results later, while Mastercard jumped 1.4% after its figures. But Pfizer and Advanced Micro Devices fell back on disappointing updates. As for the Fed meeting, the central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, but its statement will be scrutinised for clues as to its views on the state of the US economy. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, said: This week\u2019s announcement should be fairly sleepy, lacking in pomp with no press conference, no updated dot plots, or new growth forecast. Our bias is for a slightly softer statement given the recent run of macro data that saw lower inflation, a lower ISM, weak Q1 GDP growth and soft March payrolls. The urgency to tighten has diminished, though June is still a decent bet with a 70% market-assigned probability. The deal between Greece and its creditors clears one hurdle for the International Monetary Fund to take part in the country\u2019s bailout but debt relief is still needed, the fund said. In a joint statement with Greece\u2019s lenders, it said: \u201cThe Greek authorities have confirmed their intention to swiftly implement this policy package. This preliminary agreement will now be complemented by further discussions in the coming weeks on a credible strategy for ensuring that Greece\u2019s debt is sustainable.\u201d Associated Press have send over some photos from Athens today. One shows a long queue of people waiting to receive food from an organisation helping impoverished Greeks: The second shows graffiti criticising the Greek bailouts: The Wall Street Journal have a good explanation on why today\u2019s Greek bailout deal could be rather significant. They say: \u201cThis could be the beginning of the last phase in Greece\u2019s crisis,\u201d says Panos Tsakloglou, economic professor who represented Greece in eurozone finance meetings in 2012-14. Tuesday\u2019s agreement will release around \u20ac7 billion payment without which Greece would be insolvent by July. But more important, it sets the conditions for talks\u2014possibly by the end of May\u2014with creditors on a deal to lengthen the maturity and lower payments on Greece\u2019s debt. If the debt becomes more sustainable, the European Central Bank could decide to include Greece in its bond-buying program, effectively clearing the way for Athens\u2014which has been shut out of international bond markets since 2010, except for a brief window in 2014, to return to capital markets for financing. Other European Union countries that needed bailouts, such as Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus, have long returned to capital markets. Here\u2019s the full piece: WSJ: Greek Austerity Deal Opens Up Potential Path Out of Bailout Sterling got a lift from today\u2019s unexpectedly strong UK manufacturing figures, and some analysts think there\u2019s more to come. The pound has gained almost half a cent to $1.2928, not far off last week\u2019s six-month high. Traders are calculating that the Bank of England is more likely to raise interest rates soon if the factory sector is buoyant (although the rather larger service sector slowed last quarter, so...). Analysts at Nomura have predicted that the pound could end this year at $1.37 or higher, and argue that the markets are simply too pessimistic. They write: There are three reasons why we expect GBP to outperform: 1) the inflation premium in GBP is starting to look over-stretched; 2) the Bank of England may start to become less pessimistic if a positive global growth surprise catches the UK markets off-guard; and 3) the difficulty of the early stages of the Brexit negotiations looks to be priced in already On Brexit, they provide a handy chart of upcoming event (although the endgame is still rather uncertain) Nomura expect plenty of flashpoints and pitfalls as the Brexit saga plays out, but argue that this is \u2018priced in\u2019 to the pound\u2019s current levels. It\u2019s been nearly a year since the Brexit vote and a lot of the negative implications of Brexit have been widely discussed. So unless the EU starts clarifying its Brexit position as \u201ccliff edge or nothing\u201d, the political noise on its own may not be enough to drive GBP another leg lower from here. Over in Athens, the government\u2019s spokesman is defending the bailout agreement: Back in Greece, the main opposition leader has accused the leftist-led government of condemning the country to a \u201cfourth memorandum\u201d (bailout agreement). Kyriakos Mitsotakis, head of the centre right New Democracy party, slammed prime minister Alexis Tsipras for his mishandling of negotiations with creditors. Mitsotakis says the extra cuts and tax increases which the government had just agreed to are effectively a fourth bailout, declaring: \u201cIn order to stay in power, he [Tsipras] has committed the country to a fourth memorandum that will impoverish society, particularly the middle class.\u201d The new measures, Mitsotakis added, had come without any written agreement regarding debt relief or inclusion in the ECB\u2019s QE programme - long summoned by the leftist-led administration as cause for joy and a turning point in Greece\u2019s long-running ordeal to stay afloat. Much-vaunted \u201ccounter measures\u201d also triumphantly announced by the government would, Mitsotakis said, only be enforced if Greece successfully attained the very high primary budget surplus of 3.5%. Opposition parties have said they will not be endorsing the measures when they come to parliament for vote. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has issued a statement hailing Greece\u2019s agreement with its creditors. He\u2019s confident that eurozone finance ministers will back it and unlock bailout funds. But they must also now turn their attention to Greece\u2019s huge debt pile. Moscovici says: \u201cThe agreement reached overnight in Athens on the Greek Stability Support Programme is a very positive development following months of complex negotiations. These new efforts agreed by the Greek authorities open the way for a rapid conclusion of the second review. The swift implementation of these commitments should enable the Eurogroup to endorse this agreement at its next meeting. This second review is strategic for Greece as it not only delivers on key reforms to modernise the Greek economy but also secures a credible fiscal path for the years to come, beyond the ESM programme. It is now for all partners to reach an understanding on the question of Greece\u2019s debt in the coming weeks. It is time to turn the page on this long and difficult austerity chapter for the Greek people. With this agreement, we need now to write a new story of stability, jobs and growth for Greece and for the euro area as a whole.\u201d The head of the eurogroup, which oversees Greece\u2019s bailout, has welcomed the deal agreed with creditors overnight. Jeroen Dijsselbloem also confirmed that talks can now begin on making Greece\u2019s debt \u2018sustainable\u2019 (Athens hopes this means significant debt relief......) Here\u2019s more reaction to the impressive UK manufacturing report, from Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays: \u201cThe UK economy as a whole may have made a sluggish start to the year but following a solid first quarter, manufacturing continues to grow with healthy order books and encouraging levels of new investment and employment. Despite some easing, inflationary pressures will continue to take their toll on factory gate prices and ultimately manufacturers\u2019 margins, however, the weakness in sterling and an improving global outlook continue to provide export opportunities for the sector. What we don\u2019t want to see now is the prospect of fractious Brexit negotiations fostering a more cautious and uncertain approach to investment from the sector.\u201d And here\u2019s Shannon Murphy, assistant head of risk underwriting at Euler Hermes, the trade credit insurer: \u201cRecord order books and high export levels are undoubtedly a positive sign, but it\u2019s clear UK manufacturers are nervous about Brexit and the fallout from the upcoming General Election. \u201cLeaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms in 2019 could hit industry hard, cutting annual year-on-year turnovers by -1.0 per cent across the sector, and pushing up UK insolvencies across all sectors by 15 per cent. Manufacturers need reassurance from the Government that this will not happen, so it\u2019s unsurprising to see them sit on their hands. \u201cBusinesses across the sector are complaining of inadequate net returns and investment intentions have weakened significantly. While we\u2019re seeing manufacturers continue to spend on asset maintenance, such as machinery, little capital is being invested in growth as firms adopt a wait-and-see approach.\u201d Just in: unemployment across the eurozone is at its lowest level since April 2009, in another sign that Europe is recovering. The euro area jobless rate came in at 9.5% in March, matching February\u2019s level. That\u2019s weaker than forecast; economists had hoped it would fall to 9.4%. The unemployment rate across the wider European Union dropped to 8.0%, a new eight-year low. Italy\u2019s unemployment rate unexpectedly increased in March, from 11.5% to 11.7%, as more people reentered the labour force looking for work. And the youth unemployment rate in the euro area remains close to 20%, highlighting the danger of a \u2018lost generation\u2019 following the debt crisis. Eurostat explains: In March 2017, 3.883 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU28, of whom 2.727 million were in the euro area. Compared with March 2016, youth unemployment decreased by 439 000 in the EU28 and by 268 000 in the euro area. In March 2017, the youth unemployment rate was 17.2% in the EU28 and 19.4% in the euro area, compared with 19.1% and 21.3% respectively in March 2016. In March 2017, the lowest rate was observed in Germany (6.7%), while the highest were recorded in Greece (48.0% in January 2017), Spain (40.5%) and Italy (34.1%). The bad news in today\u2019s flurry of PMI surveys is that Greece\u2019s factory sector is still shrinking.... Economists are cheering the news that Britain\u2019s manufacturing growth has hit a three year high (according to Today\u2019s punchy PMI report). Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, says the manufacturing sector is in \u201crude health\u201d: \u201cFollowing the strong first quarter for manufacturing today\u2019s PMI confirms that lift off continued at the start of the second, with the surge in the pace of expansion partly thanks to the resilience of the UK order pipeline and the fact the global economy is investing again. \u201cAgainst all expectations nine months ago, UK manufacturing appears to be in rude health, having navigated significant exchange rate swings and rising input costs, companies are capitalising on the upswing in the world economy and pressing ahead with some new investments. While all the indicators are pointing to the potential of another year of decent growth for manufacturing, the importance of a comprehensive and enduring industrial strategy for the UK must not get lost in the noise of election campaigning.\u201d Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, believes factories are betting a boost from the fall in sterling. \u201cThe manufacturers we\u2019re speaking to are confident but cautious and even the prospect of a general election in five weeks\u2019 time does not seem to have worried them unduly given the result will mean a government in power until 2022. This mood appears to be reflected in the PMI data. \u201cWhile the pound remains weak and is undoubtedly pushing up import costs, we are seeing a spike in businesses seeking support to export and capitalise on overseas buyers\u2019 appetite for goods priced in sterling. Welcome as this is, though, policymakers will be mindful that long-term export strength cannot be predicated on a weak currency alone. Jeremy Cook of currency firm World First agrees, tweeting: Breaking! Britain\u2019s factory sector performed unexpectedly well in April. The UK manufacturing PMI has surged to 57.3, up from 54.2 in March, and much stronger than economists had expected. Companies reported that output, new order and new exports all grew at a faster pace last month. That means they also took on more staff to handle this extra work. It\u2019s an encouraging signal, especially as UK growth in the first three months of 2017 slowed to just 0.3% from 0.7% (as we learned last Friday). The UK PMI has now risen for nine months in a row (shown by any reading over 50), as industry rebounded quickly from the shock of the EU referendum. Duncan Brock, Director of Customer Relationships at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says companies are actually struggling to keep up with demand. Here\u2019s his take: \u201cThe UK manufacturing PMI sprung back to a three year high in April after a brief blip in March. Spring has ushered in green shoots of growth with April marking the ninth consecutive increase in manufacturing employment. The calling of a snap election has failed to dampen the spirits of industry with output growing at the fastest rate in three months. \u201cWhile the major political parties debate how best to leave Europe, British manufacturers have continued to increase their exports to the continent. A weaker pound has kept British products competitive on the world stage and encouraged the twelfth successive rise in manufacturing exports. \u201cThe British manufacturing industry is moving at such a pace that suppliers are struggling to keep up with demand. Delivery times for raw materials have increased for the twelfth successive month and there are signs of shortages for both metals and plastics. With input costs rocketing upwards, some manufacturers are beginning to stockpile raw materials to protect against future price rises. So long as sterling\u2019s buying power remains weak, however, consumers should prepare themselves for higher prices.\u201d Breaking: The eurozone factory sector recorded its fastest growth in six years last month, as its recovery gathers pace. Data firm IHS Markit reports that output, new orders and employment all jumped at this fastest rate since 2011. Most countries reported a strong rise in output (shown by a PMI of over 50 points). Germany was especially strong. Greece, though, lagged behind as years of austerity and cutbacks continued to weigh on the economy. The survey suggests that eurozone firms are more confident about their economic prospects. Markit believes that Europe\u2019s factory sector is currently growing at an annual rate of 4-5%, enough to make a significant impact. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says: \u201cCompanies are benefitting from the historically weak euro, improved growth in key export markets, rising domestic demand and ongoing central bank stimulus including record-low interest rates. \u201cOptimism about the year ahead meanwhile appears unaffected by political worries, with the first four months of 2017 seeing confidence remaining elevated at the highest level since the future output series started in 2012. \u201cStrong \u2013 and often accelerating \u2013 rates of growth were seen in all countries with the notable exception of Greece, which remained mired in decline in part due to falling exports.\u201d Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector also did well in April. It\u2019s PMI came in at a lofty 58.2, just down on March\u2019s six year high of 58.3. \u201cGerman manufacturing remained in a high gear at the start of the second quarter\u201d, says Trevor Balchin, Senior Economist at IHS Markit. France\u2019s manufacturing sector is enjoying a \u201cresurgence\u201d, reports Markit. Its PMI has risen to a healthy 55.1 in April , from 53.3 in March. Boom! Italy\u2019s factory sector has posted its fastest growth in six years. Companies reported a \u201csharp and accelerated increase\u201d in output and new orders last month, according to Markit, which encouraged them to keep hiring more staff. The Italian manufacturing PMI rose to 58.5 in April, says Markit, up from 56.2 in March. That\u2019s the best level since March 2011. Greece\u2019s government debt is jumping in value, on the back of the bailout deal reached overnight in Athens. The yield on five-year Greek bonds has fallen to around 6.1%, the lowest since October 2014. That means that their price has risen in value, as investors see Greek debt as a safer bet. Two and ten-year Greek bond prices are also strengthening. European stock markets have opened higher, amid relief that Greece is now unlikely to default on its debts this summer. The news that Athens has agreed to further austerity cuts and reforms, paving the way for debt relief talks, has cheered investors. In London, BP (+2.5%) is leading the FTSE 100 risers after reporting a big jump in profits thanks to higher oil prices. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx points out that Britain\u2019s factory report (due in an hour\u2019s time) could dampen the mood: Still to come is Tuesday morning\u2019s main focus \u2013 the UK\u2019s latest manufacturing PMI. Analysts are once again expecting the figure to trip backwards, this time from 54.2 to 54.0 month-on-month; that would take the reading to a 5 month low, and continue the downward spiral that has been in place since 2017 began. The pound would likely bear the brunt of this drop, meaning, if those estimates are accurate, the currency\u2019s current losses may only widen as the day goes on. Over in the Eurozone there was even more to deal with; not only has the region got its own wave of manufacturing PMIs, investors are also processing news of a breakthrough in the Greek bailout negotiations AND the latest polls from the French presidential election race. The latter appears to be what is driving the CAC\u2019s trading, the French index jumping 0.3% as Emmanuel Macron kept a 22 point lead over Marine Le Pen \u2013 admittedly, down from the 26 point lead seen last week. Spain\u2019s factory sector also grew at a faster pace last month, according to data firm IHS Markit. Its manufacturing PMI has risen to 54.5, up from 53.9 in March, and a little higher than expected. Companies reported that output, new orders and employment levels all rose at a faster pace. This is the 41st month running in which the PMI has been above 50 points, signalling growth. Andrew Harker, senior economist at IHS Markit, says there was a \u201cwelcome tick-up in growth\u201d across Spain\u2019s manufacturing sector in April, adding that: This should help to support confidence that the current sequence of growth can be sustained as the year progresses. Elsewhere in the eurozone, Ireland\u2019s factory sector has posted stronger growth last month. The Investec Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 index has hit a three-month high of 55.0, thanks to a rise in exports. Here\u2019s our Athens correspondent Helena Smith on the Greek bailout deal After a marathon 12 hours of negotiations, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos announced in the wee hours that Athens had finally concluded a second compliance review. The milestone will enable debt relief talks to finally begin, but it is also replete with yet more punitive cutbacks for Greeks would enable debt relief talks to finally begin. \u201cWe now have a decision that the Greek government will be called to enforce with laws and decisions,\u201d Tsakalotos told reporters. The prickly issue of primary budget surpluses - and what targets the debt-stricken country should achieve post-2018 when its third \u20ac86bn bailout expires - would be discussed as \u201cpart of a package\u201d when the issue of debt forgiveness was also addressed, the finance minister said. Measures in today\u2019s deal include pension cuts of up to 18%. The conclusion of talks will ensure that default is averted when debt payments of almost \u20ac7.5bn come due in July. But while the agreement will also mark a welcome end to the uncertainty that has plagued Greece - keeping investors at bay and the real economy in a state of turmoil - unions are already girding for battle. On May 1 over 10,000 anti-austerity protestors took to the streets of Athens. \u201cIt will be a a very hot spring,\u201d Odysseus Trivalas the acting president of the union of public sector employees (ADEDY) told the Guardian. \u201cWe have yet to see the details of this agreement but what we know is that it will mean further cuts. There will be a lot of strikes and a general 24-hour lockdown when the measures are brought to parliament for vote be that on May 12 or May 17.\u201d The breakthrough will also be a welcome relief for Berlin, the biggest provider of the more than \u20ac300bn in emergency bailout loans Greece has received since it first skirted the rocks of bankruptcy.Germany has been keen to avoid more \u201cGreek drama\u201d in the run up to general elections in September. Few believe it will seriously countenance debt relief talks before Germans go to the polls. This chart show how Greece has taken a step closer to debt relief, by agreeing to new austerity and reforms overnight: Greek journalist Nick Malkoutzis points out that Greek MPs will now debate and vote on the plan: Associated Press\u2019s Derek Gatopoulous has more details on the deal: (that\u2019s Interior Minister Panos Skourletis, I believe) After months of deadlock, Greece and her creditors appear to have finally reached an agreement on its bailout programme. Under the deal, Greece will push through fresh reforms to its labour market and energy sector, and also accept fresh pension cuts and tax rises. In return, Greece\u2019s lenders will hand over the next tranche of the \u20ac86bn bailout agreed in summer 2015. In classic Greek crisis fashion, the agreement was reached at an all-night session of talks. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos emerged from the session around dawn to declare that: \u201cThere is white smoke\u2026 the negotiation is finished with agreement on all the issues. The Wall Street Journal has details of the deal: Under the accord, Greece commits to further fiscal cuts\u2014after its current bailout ends\u2014through pension reductions equaling around 1% of gross domestic product in 2019, and a similar amount in 2020 from a reduction in the threshold for paying personal income tax. The deal now has to be approved by the Greek parliament in time for the next meeting of the Eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers), on May 22. Tsakalotos added that Greece can now start discussing debt relief, saying there is \u201cno excuse\u201d for not tackling this issue. Manufacturing PMI Day has got off to a bad start in China. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 index has fallen to 50.3 in April. That\u2019s rather lower than March\u2019s 51.2, and weaker than expected. It\u2019s also rather close to the 50-point mark that determines expansion from contraction, which means China\u2019s factory sector may be faltering. Chinese firms reported that production and new business growth slowed, and optimism about the outlook over the next 12 months fell to the lowest this year. Worryingly, companies are also cutting jobs at the fastest rate since January. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points (the full report\u2019s online here) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019re learning how the world\u2019s factories performed in April. Data firm Markit is releasing its monthly Purchasing Managers Index reports, which will show if manufacturers posted faster or slower growth last month. Economists are expecting the eurozone to post robust growth again, with the manufacturing PMI coming in unchanged at 56.8. Any reading over 50 shows growth. A strong reading would underline how Europe\u2019s economy is picking up speed this year, as its recovery gathers some momentum. However, the UK\u2019s manufacturing PMI is expected to drop to 54.0, from 54.2 in March, showing slower growth. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has the details: The final manufacturing PMI numbers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany are expected to remain fairly resilient at 54.3, 55.9, 55.1 and 58.2 respectively.... Of more concern is the fact that in recent months UK manufacturing PMI\u2019s have been drifting lower, and not higher. Today\u2019s April manufacturing PMI number is expected to come in at 54, down from 54.2, and weaker for the fourth month in a row since December\u2019s 56.1. While 54 is still a decent number the trend has been in the opposite direction to the recent trend in Europe. Later this morning, Eurostat releases March\u2019s eurozone labour market figures. Could we get a new post-crisis low? Here\u2019s the key timings: 8.15am BST: Spanish manufacturing PMI 8.45am: Italy manufacturing PMI 8.50am: France manufacturing PMI 8.55am: Germany manufacturing PMI 9am: The Eurozone manufacturing PMI 9.30am: The UK manufacturing PMI 10am: Eurozone unemployment figures We\u2019ll also be watching Greece, and its long-running talks with lenders over fresh austerity measures. Over the weekend, Germany\u2019s finance minister praised Athens, suggesting a deal to unlock more aid could be close.... On the corporate side, oil giant BT, investment group Aberdeen Asset Management, building group Bovis Homes and takeaway firm Just Eat are all reporting results. Europe\u2019s main stock markets are likely to open higher, having been closed yesterday for May Day.",

But in the absence of a spike in global risk aversion, we see enough supportive factors to prevent a full post-election unwind. Looking at the next 100 days of Trump, there are two reasons why we think this could be as good as it gets for the dollar: (1) a more watered-down Trump policy regime and (2) real interest rates in the US staying lower for longer.</p> <p> One of the major issues facing investors is determining which Trump policy paradigm will prevail over the next 100 days.

The calling of a snap election has failed to dampen the spirits of industry with output growing at the fastest rate in three months. </p> <p>\u201cWhile the major political parties debate how best to leave Europe, British manufacturers have continued to increase their exports to the continent. A weaker pound has kept British products competitive on the world stage and encouraged the twelfth successive rise in manufacturing exports. </p> <p>\u201cThe British manufacturing industry is moving at such a pace that suppliers are struggling to keep up with demand. Delivery times for raw materials have increased for the twelfth successive month and there are signs of shortages for both metals and plastics. With input costs rocketing upwards, some manufacturers are beginning to stockpile raw materials to protect against future price rises.

      "bodyText": "It will take an extra \u00a315bn of spending cuts or tax rises to eliminate the budget deficit by the time of the 2022 election, a leading thinktank has said as it laid bare the damaging legacy of the financial crisison UK living standards and public finances. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that despite \u201ctwo parliaments of pain\u201d, the Conservative-led austerity drive had made little difference to public spending when measured as a share of national income and compared with pre-downturn levels. Publishing its analysis as political parties prepare to set out their manifestos for the snap election on 8 June, the IFS said the deficit had fallen considerably since its peak in 2009\u201310. But the gap between public spending and income was still one of the biggest among advanced economies, it added. The thinktank found that while tax revenues had improved and were forecast to continue growing, there had also been a rise in public spending against the backdrop of a long and sluggish economic recovery. \u201cThe deficit is now roughly back to the level it was prior to the financial crisis, although is still above its long-run average. On the tax side, the impact on the public finances of substantial tax cuts has been more than outweighed by tax raising measures,\u201d said Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS and author of the report. \u201cOn the spending side, seven years of austerity has seen significant cuts to areas such as working-age benefits and public order and safety. But despite this, overall public spending remains slightly above its pre-crisis share of the economy. \u201cThis is due to persistently poor economic growth and an increase in the share of national income devoted to health, pensioner benefits and overseas aid.\u201d The financial crisis that began with a credit crunch in 2007 and escalated to the bailout of banks and a recession had led to a sharp reduction in national income for the UK, Emmerson\u2019s analysis showed. \u201cEven more striking is the weakness of the subsequent recovery,\u201d he said, noting GDP per adult only returned to its pre-crisis level around the end of 2015. Alluding to more than a decade of lost growth, Emmerson found that by 2022 GDP per adult would be 18% lower than it would have been had the economy grown by 2% a year since 2008 \u2013 broadly the expected rate of growth at that time. \u201cThis downgrade in expected income has adversely affected the finances of households and of the government,\u201d said Emmerson. His analysis found that in addition to plans already set out, the next government would have to find more savings and more revenues if it wanted to eliminate the deficit before a May 2022 general election. The Conservatives have repeatedly vowed to cut the deficit, which is the gap between what the government receives in tax and other revenues and what it spends on public services, benefits and other areas. In a small boost for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, figures for the last tax year showed the deficit had shrunk by 28% on the previous year to the lowest gap since 2007-08. But some economists have questioned the merits of focusing on eliminating the deficit, arguing that an austerity drive since the crisis has been counter-productive because it dented already lacklustre growth, raised welfare costs and squeezed incomes. \u201cThere is nothing special in eradicating the deficit \u2013 it is a completely arbitrary goal,\u201d said Simon Wren-Lewis, economics professor at Oxford University. He added that how quickly a government chooses to cut the deficit and bring down the stock of national debt was a political choice. \u201cThe only clear message from economics is that adjustment in the debt to GDP ratio should be fairly slow to avoid sharp decreases in spending or large increases in taxes,\u201d Wren-Lewis said. The IFS said the UK still had the fifth largest deficit out of 35 advanced economies in 2016 as a share of GDP, behind Spain, the US, Japan and France. The UK\u2019s national debt was the sixth highest. \u201cThe latest forecasts suggest the deficit will fall over the next five years. But even had the next parliament run from May 2020 to May 2025 eliminating the deficit would have been far from straightforward\u201d said Emmerson. \u201cEliminating the deficit before a May 2022 general election would be even harder: a combination of tax rises and spending cuts worth \u00a315bn on top of current plans.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Italy's \u200bAlitalia to enter administration after staff reject rescue deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Alitalia has filed for administration for the second time in a decade, a move that could see the troubled Italian national carrier restructured, sold or finally wound up. The loss-making airline asked the Italian government to put it in administration on Tuesday following a vote by employees to reject a rescue plan, which would have seen shareholders invest a further \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.7bn) but slash wages. The government is expected to appoint commissioners to assess whether Alitalia can be maintained in any capacity or liquidated. Flight schedules will continue unchanged in the meantime. It has ruled out renationalising Alitalia, which was privatised and relaunched in 2008 after filing for bankruptcy protection earlier that year. The Gulf airline Etihad, which owns 49% of Alitalia, said it would not invest any further \u201cwithout the support of all stakeholders\u201d. James Hogan, chief executive of Etihad, which took its stake in Alitalia during the last restructuring in 2014, said the airline required \u201cfundamental and far-reaching restructuring to survive and grow in future\u201d. Hogan said new challenges, including greater low cost carrier competition and the impacts of terrorist events on tourism demand, meant further, deeper change was required. Alitalia was once one of Europe\u2019s very largest airlines, but it has struggled against rivals including Ryanair and easyJet. Low cost carriers have opened bases in Italy and started operating on domestic routes, and have long surpassed Alitalia in terms of passenger numbers \u2013 and profits. The airline is counting on government support to keep operating, with a short-term loan of up to \u20ac400m likely to see it through the bankruptcy process and enable it to keep flying during the lucrative summer months.

      "bodyText": "The UK nuclear industry has issued its strongest warning yet to ministers on the problems it faces if the government is unable to strike new international atomic power deals during Brexit talks. Failure to put in place alternative arrangements to replace the existing European nuclear treaty, Euratom, which the UK is quitting as part of the article 50 process, would have a \u201cdramatic impact\u201d on Hinkley Point C and other new power stations around the country, the industry said. Ministers must avoid a \u201ccliff edge\u201d when the UK exits Euratom or face \u201cmajor disruption to business across the whole nuclear fuel cycle\u201d, the Nuclear Industry Association will warn the government on Wednesday. The stark briefing to officials, seen by the Guardian, comes just a day after MPs said the continued operations of the UK nuclear industry were at risk from exiting the Euratom treaty. A Lords committee on Tuesday also said the UK risked losing access to markets and skills when leaving Euratom. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the NIA, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had today two select committee reports that have both touched on this. The industry has been and is clear to government we are ready to do what we can \u2013 but it needs the government to get on with this and engage now, regardless of all the other issues they have to deal with.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s decision to call a general election had made matters worse, he added, because it had squeezed the time available to establish alternatives to the treaty. Euratom was first signed in 1957 by Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and covers nuclear power station inspections, trade of materials and research. The UK\u2019s departure will mean the government needs to agree a new inspections regime with the International Atomic Energy Agency to replace Euratom inspectors. \u201cIf the UK has not replaced the Euratom safeguards regime with its own system by the time it left Euratom, normal business could be disrupted right across the nuclear industry,\u201d the NIA paper said. Falling back on World Trade Organisation standards would risk putting the UK in breach of its obligations in international nuclear law, the organisation added. Nuclear cooperation agreements (NCAs) would also need to be put in place with key nuclear countries outside the EU, including the US, Japan and Australia, because the UK\u2019s agreements with those governments are currently based on its membership of Euratom. The report said: \u201cLeaving the Euratom treaty without alternative arrangements in place would have a dramatic impact on the nuclear industry including the UK\u2019s new build plans, existing operations and the waste and decommissioning sector which all depend, to some extent, on cooperation with nuclear states.\u201d Greatrex said that matters were complicated by the fact that things had to be done in sequence, rather than in parallel. The new safeguards and inspection regime needed to be in place before the NCAs were struck, for example. Nuclear experts said that despite the dire warnings, the industry was not exaggerating the risks. Dame Sue Ion, honorary president of the Nuclear Skills Academy and former chair of the Nuclear Innovation Research Advisory Board, said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely real [the impact if alternatives are not in place]. It literally does mean you cannot move material or IP [intellectual property] or services or components or medical isotopes.\u201d She was echoed by Rupert Cowen, a senior nuclear energy lawyer at Prospect Law. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re overstating the case,\u201d he told the Guardian. Cowen was critical of officials in government who he called \u201cignorant\u201d of the impact of leaving Euratom and who \u201cthink it\u2019ll be alright on the night. It won\u2019t.\u201d The NIA urged the government to give \u201cstrong consideration\u201d to remaining a member of Euratom if it had not thrashed out new deals and arrangements by the end of the two-year window triggered by article 50. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has a world-leading nuclear industry and the government is working to ensure effective arrangements remain in place for nuclear co-operation with both Europe and the rest of the world. We will remain absolutely committed to the highest standards of nuclear safety, safeguards and support for the industry.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The future of Britain\u2019s power supply has been jeopardised by Brexit and the government must act urgently to ensure nuclear power stations stay open, MPs have warned. The influential Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee said that any gap between the UK leaving a European atomic power treaty and entering into secure alternative deals would \u201cseverely inhibit nuclear trade and research and threaten power supplies\u201d. The cross-party group of MPs said it shared the nuclear industry\u2019s concern that it would take more than two years to hammer out a new deal for regulating nuclear power stations and trade. It urged the government to delay exit from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) or set up transitional arrangements, which may need to be longer than the three years proposed by the European parliament. In a stark warning, Iain Wright, the committee\u2019s chair, said: \u201cThe impact of Brexit on Euratom has not been thought through. The government has failed to consider the potentially severe ramifications of its Brexit objectives for the nuclear industry. Ministers must act as urgently as possible. The repercussions of failing to do so are huge. The continued operations of the UK nuclear industry are at risk.\u201d The committee\u2019s report echoed a warning from nuclear energy lawyers that leaving Euratom without a new deal would see the trade in nuclear fuel grind to a halt and could ultimately force Britain\u2019s reactors to switch off. A former government adviser had told the committee that the UK nuclear industry would be \u201ccrippled\u201d if new nuclear cooperation deals are not agreed within two years. The Euratom treaty promotes uniform safety standards, cooperation and research into nuclear power. Justin Bowden, national officer of the GMB union, said the committee\u2019s warning \u201cyet again emphasises our government\u2019s lack of anything that could be called a coherent energy policy. \u201cIn a world outside of the European Union, energy self-sufficiency is common sense and nuclear, alongside gas, will be fundamental in that reliable mix,\u201d he said. \u201cDecisive action must take place now. The electorate will not forgive politicians of any political party who fail in their duty to maintain the electricity supply.\u201d Wright said: \u201cThe prime minister has made it politically unfeasible to remain in Euratom long term. The government now has a responsibility to end the uncertainty hanging over the industry and ensure robust and stable arrangements to protect trade, boost research and development, and ensure safeguarding of the highest level.\u201d The government argues that the UK must leave Euratom following Theresa May\u2019s triggering of article 50 on 29 March, but the committee notes that legal opinion is divided. MPs are concerned that in the long run, the UK will become a \u201crule taker\u201d \u2013 complying with but unable to influence European rules and standards. The committee warns that if UK standards diverge too far from those in the EU, Britain could become a dumping ground for energy-inefficient products. MPs are also worried that Brexit could distract the government from achieving emissions reduction targets, enshrined in domestic law. The committee\u2019s report recommends maintaining access to the internal energy market and retaining membership of the emissions trading system until 2020 at least. Alternatives include retaining unrestricted energy trade between the UK and the EU, or seeking third party access to the market. The University of Cambridge suggested that energy cooperation could be reframed as an issue of security rather than trade, and an energy security treaty could be established with neighbouring countries. \u201cWe believe that membership of the internal energy market has been beneficial to UK and EU consumers and has helped provide flexibility and certainty to the supply of energy,\u201d MPs said. \u201cWe therefore agree with the government\u2019s intention to retain as free as possible access to this market and the intention to remain an influential player on energy in the EU. \u201cWhile there are undoubtedly weaknesses in the operation of some EU policies on energy and climate change, notably the EU emissions trading system, the secretary of state, Greg Clark, acknowledged that cooperation with EU partners was generally mutually beneficial. The UK has consistently been a driver of high standards and ambitious climate change targets.\u201d",

The University of Cambridge suggested that energy cooperation could be reframed as an issue of security rather than trade, and an energy security treaty could be established with neighbouring countries.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that membership of the internal energy market has been beneficial to UK and EU consumers and has helped provide flexibility and certainty to the supply of energy,\u201d MPs said. \u201cWe therefore agree with the government\u2019s intention to retain as free as possible access to this market and the intention to remain an influential player on energy in the EU.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there are undoubtedly weaknesses in the operation of some EU policies on energy and climate change, notably the EU emissions trading system, the secretary of state, Greg Clark, acknowledged that cooperation with EU partners was generally mutually beneficial. The UK has consistently been a driver of high standards and ambitious climate change targets.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s failure to deliver on a multimillion-pound competition to develop mini atomic power stations has hurt the nuclear sector and risks international companies walking away from the UK, a Lords committee has warned. In 2015 the then chancellor George Osborne promised \u00a3250m over five years for a nuclear research and development programme, an undisclosed sum of which was for a competition to pave the way for small modular reactors. These reactors are much smaller than conventional nuclear plants with a capacity of less than 300MW \u2013 or a 10th of what Hinkley Point C should provide. But the government has failed to even publish results of the first phase of the competition, expected last autumn, which the Lords science and technology committee said was \u201cparticularly alarming\u201d. \u201cThis has had a negative effect on the nuclear sector in the UK and if the government does not act soon the necessary high level of industrial interest will not be maintained,\u201d they said in a report on Tuesday. The peers urged ministers to publish their plans for small modular reactors (SMRs) without delay, and scolded the government for not showing any urgency to make a decision. The UK and US are vying to attract the companies and supply chains to research, develop and build small modular reactors. The industry argues they could be quicker and cheaper to build than normal nuclear power stations, partly by being prefabricated in factories. Rolls-Royce, which is bidding for a slice of the competition funding, told the Lords it hoped to deploy a small modular reactor in the UK by 2028 if it had government backing. The company is competing with Chinese state firm CNNC, US firm NuScale and the US-Japanese partnership GE-Hitachi. Toshiba\u2019s US nuclear arm Westinghouse was also among the bidders but is now unlikely to proceed after filing for bankruptcy in March. Newcastle-based Penultimate Power UK, which hopes to capitalise on the market, told the committee that a lack of clarity from government had paralysed development of nuclear power generation technology. \u201cWithout urgent action the window of opportunity for meaningful participation will soon close,\u201d the company said. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said he shared the committee\u2019s frustration and the competition had been \u201cleft hanging in the air\u201d, with the roadmap for the reactors \u201clost somewhere in Whitehall\u201d. Trawsfynydd in Wales, the site of a former nuclear power station, has been pitched by the Welsh government as a potential site for the UK\u2019s first SMR, because of its transport and power links, and skilled former nuclear workers. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThe government recognises the potential of small modular reactors to help meet our energy and climate change challenges at a lower cost.\u201d Government officials said earlier this year that one of the attractions of mini nuclear power stations was they fitted with the industrial strategy launched by Theresa May. But Tom Wintle, deputy director at the business department, said they had to provide affordable power. \u201cSMRs will need to deliver energy cost-competitively if they are to play a part in the UK\u2019s future energy mix. As well as securing low-carbon energy, government is also committed to keeping down the cost of that energy for consumers, so there is a key challenge there for the nuclear industry as a whole and for SMRs,\u201d he told an industry conference.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s factories enjoyed their fastest growth for three years last month on the back of strong demand at home and abroad, according to a survey that will temper worries about a Brexit-driven economic slowdown this year. The manufacturing sector, which makes up about a tenth of the UK economy, enjoyed the strongest pick-up in new work since the start of 2014 and smashed expectations in April. Firms also took on new workers at a faster pace and ramped up production, the closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI (pdf) showed. Its main barometer of business activity jumped to 57.3 in April from 54.2 in March. That confounded forecasts for a modest slowdown to 54.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. A reading above 50 shows growth while one below indicates it is contracting. The measure for manufacturing only briefly fell below that no-change mark in the wake of last June\u2019s vote to leave the EU but then recovered along with readings for the construction industry and the much larger services sector. The latest manufacturing report signalled that strong demand came from the domestic market as well as overseas, continuing a pattern of export support for UK firms from the weaker pound. Sterling\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote has made UK goods cheaper in foreign markets. But it has also raised the cost of imports. The survey of more than 600 industrial companies follows official figures last week showing the UK economy slowed markedly in the first three months of 2017 as the effect of higher import costs worked its way through the economy, raising inflation and squeezing consumer spending. But while some consumer-facing businesses have struggled, manufacturers have reported a boost from the weaker pound and from a recovery in the global economy. PMI surveys published earlier on Tuesday showed eurozone factory growth hit a six-year high in April. The PMI report\u2019s compilers said strength and demand from North America, Europe, Africa and Brazil were helping UK factories. But they cautioned against reading too much into April\u2019s bounce. \u201cAlthough only accounting for 10% of the economy, the upturn in the manufacturing sector represents some welcome good news after the sharp slowing in GDP seen in the first quarter,\u201d said Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit. \u201cThe big question is whether this growth spurt can be maintained, especially given the backdrop of ongoing market volatility and a number of political headwinds such as elections at home and abroad. Other surges seen since the middle of last year have generally proved short-lived, as weak wage growth sapped consumer spending.\u201d The report also raised concerns about manufacturers facing shortages of raw materials. That was adding to cost pressures and companies mentioned paying higher prices for a wide range of materials, including chemicals, metals and plastics. But input cost inflation had eased significantly since hitting a record high in January, Dobson noted. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays highlighted the mixed effects of the weak pound on manufacturers. \u201cDespite some easing, inflationary pressures will continue to take their toll on factory gate prices and ultimately manufacturers\u2019 margins, however, the weakness in sterling and an improving global outlook continue to provide export opportunities for the sector,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to see now is the prospect of fractious Brexit negotiations fostering a more cautious and uncertain approach to investment from the sector.\u201d Economists are looking ahead to PMI reports from the construction sector on Wednesday and the services sector on Thursday for more clues on how the economy fared last month. Some doubt how far a manufacturing improvement can make up for weaker consumer spending. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to forecasters the EY ITEM Club, said: \u201cWith \u2018the makers\u2019 accounting for little more than 10% of GDP, it will require a strong performance from the sector to compensate for headwinds from inflation and other sources affecting the dominant services sector.\u201d But Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cAfter last week\u2019s surprisingly downbeat first quarter GDP figures ... today\u2019s survey provides us with optimism that the manufacturing sector should play a bigger role in offsetting the slowdown in the consumer services sector ahead.\u201d",

Last year Rapha sales jumped almost 30% to \u00a363m as it tapped latent demand for fashionable cycling gear and opened stores \u2013 or \u201cclubhouses\u201d as it calls them \u2013 as far afield as Seoul and Chicago. The London-based business founded in 2004 by Mottram, a former branding consultant, got this far in the race under its own steam but recently hired an investment bank to look at options for its future, which could include a sale. Despite its flash gear \u2013 Mottram\u2019s commuting outfit of reflective jacket, tights and overshoes would give little change from \u00a3500 \u2013 it has had less than \u00a36m of external investment from shareholders over the past 13 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to trade our way to success,\u201d says Mottram. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough capital to keep growing the way we are growing but you are always thinking, could you go faster?\u201d Founded in the days before the crowdfunding campaigns that supported companies such as Brewdog, it took more than 200 meetings for the entrepreneur to secure startup cash for Rapha, with some of the pot drawn from friends and family who remain shareholders. It resulted in an unusual set-up with Mottram owning just 12.5% and the remainder shared among a group that includes the private equity firm Active, which has 20%. \u201cFundraising was very difficult at the beginning because there was no obvious market and I had no track record of creating clothing or building an e-commerce business,\u201d says Mottram. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a minority shareholder so have had to make it work.\u201d Last year Rapha was said to be on the shopping list of Catterton, the private equity arm of the luxury goods group LVMH, which has since bought the Italian bike brand Pinarello. Who would be the right backer for Rapha? \u201cWe\u2019re not sure really,\u201d Mottram says. \u201cI\u2019m really happy with the ownership we have. They have been massively supportive. The thing outsiders don\u2019t realise is how pure what we do is. I\u2019ve been allowed to create the perfect model of what I think a consumer brand should be.\u201d Rapha might not be a household name but in the tribal cycling community it is a \u201cMarmite\u201d brand at the centre of fierce forum debates where detractors see it as the fiefdom of wealthy metrosexuals or the \u201cRaphia\u201d. Named after a defunct French cycling team from the late 1950s, it has unashamedly sought to market a lifestyle \u2013 selling everything from luxurious merino jumpers to \u00a320 embrocation creams and bespoke holidays in the Alps where you can \u201creconnect\u201d with your bike on gruelling cols. It even has its own riding club with 9,000 members paying \u00a3135 a year for perks including free coffee in its clubhouses. \u201cWe are totally in love with the sport,\u201d says Mottram. \u201cWe love the product and think the product should be as good as the sport. I care about how I look and perhaps that makes me a shallow person but why on a bike should you not?\u201d Mottram acknowledges the brand is out of reach of some pockets and last year it launched a range of more affordable gear that included jerseys for under \u00a3100. \u201cWe have carved out a market at the top,\u201d he says. \u201cThe future is to keep that quality but to reach more people. Aldi does a cycling jersey for \u00a315 to \u00a320 but we won\u2019t do that because that isn\u2019t really a cycling jersey \u2013 it\u2019s a piece of polyester. But we do need to make our pricing more accessible.\u201d Like an overweight mamil, Rapha\u2019s head office in a converted warehouse in north London is bursting at the seams, and an injection of new funds would presumably accelerate the search for larger premises. Inside, the white-painted brick walls are adorned with cycling memorabilia, while the reception cum coffee bar buzzes like an Apple store. Whereas most companies would put bike racks outside, Rapha\u2019s ground floor is dominated by several rows with new employees indoctrinated into its bike-mad culture. \u201cRapha is by its nature a premium lifestyle brand with its clubhouses and holidays,\u201d says one industry executive with knowledge of the sector. \u201cIf I was Simon I\u2019d be looking for the support of a luxury brand or the private office of a wealthy family, who will let him carry on doing what he\u2019s doing, rather than a private equity firm. There is a lot more mileage in the brand but there is a need to professionalise some aspects of the way it is run.\u201d Official statistics point to cycle use increasing in the UK with 3.5bn miles cycled in 2016 \u2013 23% above the figure for 10 years before \u2013 but the experience of mainstream chains such as Halfords points to a nation of fair weather cyclists with peaks and troughs as the euphoria created by Team GB is dampened by summer rides in lashing rain. The global market for cycling paraphernalia is estimated to be worth $47bn \u2013 five times that of golf \u2013 according to the consultants OC&amp;C, with Rapha seeing scope to move beyond this year\u2019s target of 20 clubhouses to 100 around the world. \u201cThe dream for Rapha is the same as for cycling,\u201d says Mottram. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be a niche sport which has a little boom then goes back into its shell. I want it to be mainstream and for Rapha to be at the centre of making that happen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Parents are predicted to lend more than \u00a36.5bn this year to help their children get on the property ladder as first-time buyers continue to struggle to afford homes. This is a 30% increase on the \u00a35bn loaned in 2016, according to research from Legal &amp; General and economics consultancy Cebr, and means parents will be involved in more than 25% of UK property transactions. The so-called bank of mum and dad will help fund property purchases worth about \u00a375bn in 2017, the report says, including deposits for more than 298,000 mortgages. The \u00a36.5bn figure is similar to the amount lent by the country\u2019s ninth-biggest mortgage lender, Yorkshire Building Society, according to L&amp;G. Parental assistance is expected to have risen from an average of \u00a317,000 in 2016 to \u00a321,600 this year. Millennials are the biggest recipients, with 79% of the funding going to people under 30. The south-west of England and London will see the largest average parental contribution per transaction, at \u00a330,000 and \u00a329,400, with Wales the lowest at \u00a312,500. The report says the amount of lending by parents is more evidence that the UK housing market is failing to work properly. Nigel Wilson, the chief executive of L&amp;G said: \u201cThis is the second year of our bank of mum and dad research programme and the statistics show the problem is getting worse, not better. \u201cTransaction volumes are down in the housing market, but [parental] funding is growing exponentially. This is not a good thing, nor is it sustainable or equitable for our parents [the lenders] or young people [the borrowers]. \u201cThe intergenerational inequality that creates the demand for [parental] funding continues to widen \u2013 younger people today don\u2019t have the same opportunities that the baby boomers had, including affordable housing, defined benefit pensions and free university education. \u201cParents want to help their kids get on in life, and the bank of mum and dad is a testament to their generosity, but it is also a symptom of our broken housing market. \u201cThe UK is experiencing a supply-side crisis in housing \u2013 we are simply not building enough houses. We need to build more homes for the young, old and families alike, more quickly and cost effectively.\u201d The report also found that just 40% of parents provide equal financial support to all their children, with 18% only helping the eldest child buy a property and 16% supporting the youngest child. And most parents provide a fixed amount of help, despite regional variations in property values. Only 20% were prepared to provide more assistance for children living in pricier areas. But in London, 40% of homeowners had received financial help from their parents to buy their property.",

Turnover edged higher at the 100 largest caravan, camping and holiday parks, from \u00a32.66bn in 2015 to \u00a32.67bn, according to research by Ortus Secured Finance. Sterling\u2019s 13% slump against the US dollar and 9% drop against the euro since the EU referendum vote last June has also made holidaying at home more attractive, as the pound\u2019s weakness bumps up the cost of foreign travel. John Salisbury, managing director of Ortus, a property lender, said: \u201cCaravan, camping and holiday parks are going from strength to strength, combining value for money with high-standard facilities to maximise the guest experience. \u201cThe recession and the ensuing trend for staycations gave holiday parks, camping and caravan sites access to an even broader customer base. They have been building on this ever since.\u201d Holiday park firms have become the subject of a flurry of private equity deals, with robust growth and solid revenues catching the eye of investors. Deals have included the \u00a31.35bn sale of Parkdean Resorts, the UK\u2019s largest caravan operator, to the Canadian private equity firm Onex Corporation in December. Park Leisure was snapped up for \u00a3103m by a consortium led by Midlothian Capital Partners, while Intermediate Capital Group bought Park Holidays for \u00a3362m last year. Ortus said facilities such as shops, restaurants, bars and swimming pools were key to keeping holiday parks and campsites attractive and increasing customer spending. But operators needed to continue investing to attract ever more selective holidaymakers, though this could be challenging for such seasonal businesses, especially among the smaller operators. These businesses often struggled to set cash aside for renovations and additional amenities due to peaks and troughs in cashflow, according to the Ortus report. \u201cLike many other businesses in the tourism, leisure and hospitality industries, operators need to commit to continued capital investment in order to maintain competitiveness and stay ahead of the game,\u201d Salisbury said. \u201cAs the market increasingly demands not only well-maintained everyday amenities but luxury add-ons like wood-fired showers, pools, games rooms and wifi, this opens up significant opportunities to generate more revenue and fuel growth. \u201cAlternative sources of funding are playing a critical role here, enabling businesses to access the [capital] they need to deliver the high-quality facilities that many guests have come to expect.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It was night, stormy, and the oil rig Transocean Winner was somewhere in the North Atlantic on 7 August 2016 when her tow-line broke. No crew members were on board. The rig was being dragged by a tugboat called Forward, the tethered vessels charting a course out of Norway that was meant to take them on a month-long journey to Malta. Within the offices of Transocean Ltd, the oil-exploration company that owned the rig, such a journey might have been described with corporate seemliness as an \u201cend-of-life voyage\u201d; but in the saltier language heard offshore, the rig was \u201cgoing for fucking razorblades\u201d \u2013 for scrap, to be dismantled in a shipbreaking yard east of Malta. In that Atlantic storm, several thousand miles from her intended destination, Winner floated free. The 33-year-old rig had never moved with so little constraint. Winner was huge \u2013 17,000 tonnes, like an elevated Trafalgar Square, complete with a middle derrick as tall as Nelson\u2019s Column, her four legs the shape of castle keeps; all this was borne up in the water on a pair of barge-sized pontoons \u2013 and its positioning had always been precisely controlled. While moored, she was held in place by eight heavy anchors. At other times, she was sailed with a pilot at the helm as if she were any other ship. When contracted to drill in the North Sea, as she had been since the 1980s, boring into the bedrock for hidden reservoirs of oil, Winner\u2019s anchors and underwater propellers worked together with her on-board computers to \u201cdynamically position\u201d her \u2013 that is, keep her very still. The men and women who formed Winner\u2019s crew \u2013 drillers and engineers and geologists and divers and cleaners and cooks, most of them Norwegian \u2013 imagined this rig to have a character that would resist such checks. They nicknamed her Svanen, or Swan, because to them she was both elegant and unyielding. Scheduled as she was for destruction, Winner could not have chosen a better moment to bolt. The master on the tugboat Forward radioed for help. Through a series of exchanges with Transocean, as well as with the British coastguard and Forward\u2019s owners, the Rotterdam-based ALP Maritime, the master explained his situation. Both tugboat and rig had been caught in heavy weather while circumnavigating the Hebrides, sailing a mile and a half off the Scottish islands. It turned into the worst summer storm in the region for years, with winds of 40 knots and waves 10 metres high. Throughout the afternoon of 7 August, Forward and Winner were tossed on a course running parallel with the coast of Lewis, one of the outermost Hebridean islands. For a time it seemed they would be sent on by, still fettered to each other, still Mediterranean-bound. But in the early evening the wind changed direction, and Forward and Winner \u2013 or more accurately, Winner and Forward, given that the rig was now acting as a huge metal sail and comfortably tugging her own tugboat \u2013 were forced landward. It was around 4am when the master radioed to confirm that the tow-line had snapped. Winner had, for all of her life, been painted bright orange. The colour had become chipped and rust-stained over time, but was still vivid in daylight, visible for miles. In the storm, the rig disappeared completely. Radar data from those early-morning hours showed Forward moving back and forth in the water off Lewis, as if retracing steps for something misplaced. It was agreed between Transocean, ALP, the coastguard and other emergency authorities that Winner was irretrievable. Everybody would wait until sunrise, and see. * * * Stavanger The world has a problem with its oil rigs. There are too many of them, and for the first time since the earliest manufacture of seaborne drilling platforms 50 or 60 years ago, decisions are being made about how and where to get rid of them in number. That there should be a sudden surplus is vexing for those invested in undersea drilling: as recently as 2010 the rigs were thought too few. Back then, had an oil company such as Shell or BP or Marathon wanted to dig down and discover what was lying beneath a particular patch of sea, it wasn\u2019t unusual for them to wait as long as a year until an exploration company such as Transocean or Diamond or Ensco had a rig available to lease to them. It was a time of undersupply. Dozens of new rigs were commissioned, and worldwide orders tripled between 2010 and 2011. But oil rigs take two or three years to build, and by the time these were ready for use, the price of oil had declined sharply, and with it the industry\u2019s hunger to prospect \u2013 thus the oversupply. Rigs without contracts to drill were either \u201ccold-stacked\u201d (anchored without crew) to wait for a market recovery, or sold for demolition. More than 40 oil rigs were waved off on end-of-life voyages in 2015, according to data gathered by a Brussels-based maritime NGO called Shipbreaking Platform; up from a single dispensed-with rig, so far as the NGO knew, in 2014. It was a hasty and disordered rebalancing of the global fleet, and not all the decisions made were sensible. In the spring of 2016, for instance, at about the time Transocean was considering whether or not to decommission Winner, its drilling rival Ensco sent away two rigs that were relatively new: built in 2004, and meant to bear 30 or 40 years of graft, but hurriedly euthanised after 12. Winner, by comparison, had lived long and busily. She was launched in 1983, and in the decades since had bobbed through market downturns and upturns, through winter hurricanes and underwater blowouts, and at least two on-board deaths. For the most part, Winner\u2019s 33 years at sea had been characterised by day after day of patient, repetitive work \u2013 the stuff that gives offshore life its rhythm and, for many, its special comfort. Drill supervisor Andr\u00e9 Arctander, a tanned greybeard from Stavanger in Norway, calculated that he had spent a third of his life on this rig. The colour of his boilersuit had changed, Arctander said, in accordance with the branding requirements of drilling clients, but he retained throughout a deeper loyalty to Winner and her regular crew \u201cthat went beyond corporate logos\u201d. He spoke of getting so in tune with the rig during his fortnight-long stints on board that he could fall asleep in his cabin and wake up knowing half of what had happened while he was under, just from having felt the changes in Winner\u2019s vibrations and having heard her machine-purrs. In spring 2016, as Winner was nearing the end of an 11-month contract with Marathon to drill in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, rumours of her possible scrapping spread around the crew. In the rig\u2019s \u201csmoko\u201d rooms and coffee shops, they discussed the contradiction that underpinned their industry: while the price of oil might move up and down, shareholders in drilling companies tended to prefer numbers that moved in only one direction. It was difficult and expensive to maintain a cold-stacked rig. Winner had herself been cold-stacked once, and the crew\u2019s first task after reboarding was to snap away the icicles in their cabins. Meanwhile, there were immediate returns to be made by selling for scrap. \u201cIt would be better to have long-term plans and a buffer of funds to use during hard times,\u201d Arctander thought. \u201cBut this is not how it works.\u201d In July, Winner\u2019s scrapping was confirmed. A Norwegian crane operator posted a message on the rig\u2019s Facebook page: \u201cMalta og spiker next.\u201d Loosely translated, he meant: \u201cMalta next, then a furnace \u2013 somewhere.\u201d It is common for rigs on end-of-life voyages to be towed with their tracking systems switched off. On 3 August, Winner sent out a final blip from a fjord in southern Norway, near Stavanger, and then stopped sending a signal. The tugboat Forward then took her out into the North Sea. On 6 August, Winner entered the Atlantic, and the next day she was lost in the storm off the Hebrides. On 8 August, shortly before sunrise on the Isle of Lewis, the oil rig washed in with the tide. * * * Dalmore Bay Her 17,000 tonnes came in on Dalmore Bay, one of the island\u2019s prettiest beaches, a quarter-mile crescent of bone-coloured sand and muscular swell that, on a normal Monday morning, could expect to be visited by dog-walkers, surfers, kayakers, seabirds, even dolphins. Back behind the sand, where the beach narrowed and formed an uneven track up to the coastal road, lay the gravestones of a hundred or so islanders. A fractional difference in the gusts and tides overnight, and the runaway Winner might have brought her great weight down on the resting place of one Malcolm MacCauley, whose grave was set closest to the water. As it was, the rig collided with the headland that defined Dalmore Bay\u2019s southern edge \u2013 a slope of marram grass busy with snails that rose to a boggy cliff and then fell away to rocks on the foreshore. Winner\u2019s pontoons scraped into the shallows and a strut of her crosswise steel snagged on a tall, tooth-shaped crag. The rig pitched to the south, away from the beach, her derrick cutting obliquely across the sky and her helipad inclining at an angle that to the human eye read as almost apologetic. However terrific a noise this made nobody was around to hear it, bar the seabirds and snails. The police started to arrive around 7am, as did the first stunned residents. Lewis is made of old, old rock. There is presumed to be Viking DNA coursing through the islanders, and it is a general trait of the community that its members be stoic and unhysterical, whatever difficulties \u2013 generally weather-borne \u2013 come this far north to trouble them. Perhaps there were some on Lewis that week who heard that an oil rig had struck and shrugged. But most who were mobile and even mildly curious put aside their habitual stoicism to make a trip to the beach and stare. \u201cOn Lewis?\u201d said Don MacKay, a fisherman. \u201cThis was seismic.\u201d When MacKay journeyed to Dalmore to see Winner, he was put in mind of a steel spider, poised on the shore as if plotting some sinister next move. Laura Carse, a surfer, felt it was like the time she returned home to find her house had been burgled. Not because Winner\u2019s presence struck her as violent, or a violation, \u201cbut because my brain could not quite manage the image\u201d. This was as if a church or a rollercoaster had suddenly manifested on the sand. Don MacKay said: \u201cYes. It took a wee bit of time to absorb the info.\u201d Winner\u2019s name was painted on her forward side, the black-on-yellow letters so large as to be crisply distinguishable from the shore \u2013 a scale that would only start to make sense to onlookers when emergency salvage workers boarded the rig, and it could be seen that each letter was about three humans tall. The first salvage mission to Winner was made by coastguard helicopter. A team of six were lowered one by one by winch to the deck of the rig, and were removed again by helicopter that evening. By Winner\u2019s second day in Dalmore, the weather made any more such airborne trips impossible. For a week the rig simply stayed where she was, unoccupied, her weight against the rocks. When the salvors got back on board, they did so by boat, sailing close enough to hop on to a pontoon and scale one of the rig\u2019s legs using ropes. It was not easy to go back and forth from rig to shore this way, so the team sequestered cabins and stayed aboard. One of them reported that, because of Winner\u2019s tilt, her bunks were uncomfortable to sleep in, at least until they removed the cabin doors and propped them horizontally beneath the mattresses. Tugboats and other support vessels now filled Dalmore Bay, waiting for the go-ahead to tow Winner off the rocks. Robotic diving units were sent underwater to collect images of the rig\u2019s pontoons. Both were badly damaged, one with a narrow triangular hole that was at least 10 metres from end to end, the metal drawn and furled at the base so that it resembled a heaved-open theatre curtain. Early visitors to Dalmore had reported a smell of fuel coming over the sands. Nobody in this part of the country could forget what had happened in the Shetlands in the early 1990s when a tanker, Braer, foundered in a storm off the islands\u2019 southern edge and disgorged many thousands of tonnes of crude oil into the water. There were fears of a similar spill from Winner, but the truth was that, although she was often referred to as an oil rig, Winner\u2019s real business was mud. During her decades at sea, Winner was generally a tunneller, commissioned to bore through layers of undersea rock and sludge, after which a purpose-built tanker would float in and slurp up any finds. It was estimated at the time of her grounding that Winner carried a few hundred tonnes of diesel fuel, kept in tanks in her pontoons. Some of this fuel had escaped through the tears in the pontoons. Salvors drained what remained into tanks on the surrounding support boats, and meanwhile concocted a plan to pump compressed air into the newly emptied pontoons. This would set Winner afloat again. She could then be towed off the headland on a high or rising tide, and dragged to a bay on the other side of Lewis, where it could be figured out how to make her properly seaworthy. What had begun as the quiet removal of Winner from Norway \u2013 a journey scarcely noticed by anyone outside the oil business \u2013 was now a richly public event. Nothing quite like it had happened in the Hebrides since the 1940s, when the cargo ship Politician, abundantly loaded with bottled spirits, ran aground on the nearby island of Eriskay. The local response on that occasion \u2013 an outrageous carrying-away of the booze \u2013 inspired a novel and a film, Whisky Galore. In the case of Winner, her plunder value existed in her bones \u2013 her predominantly steel frame \u2013 and it was residual value that would not be easily released; something to which Transocean could by now attest. It had in its fleet more rigs than any other drilling company \u2013 more than 70 in 2016 \u2013 and the earlier pruning of about a dozen of these vessels had been conducted with discretion. Now the sun was up on a fiasco. Dave Walls was one of the Transocean directors who flew to Lewis from the company\u2019s headquarters in Aberdeen. At a press conference on the island 11 days after the accident, Walls pledged that Winner would be recovered from the rocks and put her back on her journey east. \u201cWe will make right any damage,\u201d Walls said. Transocean later gave the Dalmore community \u00a3120,000 in reparations. A financial statement released by the oil company in November 2016 made clear the larger cost of the accident: at least $21m (\u00a316m). That month, on 21 November, Walls was asked at a parliamentary hearing about the circumstances leading up to Winner\u2019s nighttime escape. Why had the rig been pulled into a storm that was long forecast? Walls seemed to suggest that the master on the tugboat Forward had tried, in error, to outrun or outmuscle the Hebridean seas. (The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has been looking into the incident since the summer of 2016, and its report is expected later this year. In response to my request for comment, Transocean cited this ongoing investigation and declined to answer my questions about Winner. In a statement, Transocean added: \u201cWe will continue to meet our responsibilities arising out of this incident.\u201d) On Lewis, in the aftermath of the grounding, there were historically unprecedented traffic jams on the single-track road to the beach. Access was now forbidden, and a policeman guarded the junction. Arriving on the island, I made enquiries about getting aboard Winner and was told, roughly speaking, that I had about as much chance of getting on the whisky-carrying Politician, which had been on the bottom of the sea for 70 years. A restriction zone around Winner took in land, sea and air, so that hikers were forbidden to walk the fringing coastal paths and fishermen were told to putter their boats at a distance. On the evening of 22 August, allowances were made for a seismic local event, and islanders were permitted back to their beach to watch Winner be towed away. Around a hundred people came to watch, a shuttle bus running them down the beach road in shifts. A tea station was set up by volunteers. Midges hummed about. At 9pm the sun went down behind the rig, quite spectacularly, and after that the tow-lines between Winner and her tugs visibly tautened. The underwater pontoons were filled with compressed air. A shout went up on the shore: \u201cShe\u2019s on the move!\u201d There was a ripple of applause. As she came off the rocks, \u201cseemingly inch by inch\u201d, said Don MacKay, Winner continued to list very badly. She was towed north across the bay until hidden by a distant headland. There was another round of applause on the beach, then a polite rush for the first shuttle bus. MacKay was not sorry to see Winner go, he said, but like many of the islanders, he had become curious about the rig\u2019s fate and intended to follow her progress. Authorities had said they expected Winner to arrive on the eastern side of Lewis the next day, a Tuesday. But when MacKay checked that day, she had not yet appeared. He checked again early on Wednesday. Still no sign. The runaway rig had once more disappeared from public view. * * * Gothenburg That Winner floated at all when she came off the rocks was the consequence of an old tragedy, half-forgotten by the summer of 2016, but rawly felt at the time of this rig\u2019s invention. In 1980, a North Sea rig called Alexander Kielland had been struck by savage winds that weakened one of its legs and, with lethal suddenness, caused it to list and capsize. Of 212 crew, only 89 survived. North Sea rigs, it was ruled by British and Scandinavian authorities, must be fit to withstand such winds, and worse. That year, at the G\u00f6taverken Arendal shipyard in Gothenburg, Sweden, an engineer called Hadar Liden sketched Winner\u2019s shape on paper with these instructions in mind. \u201cIf she lost a leg on the water,\u201d recalled Liden, who in the 1970s and 80s was G\u00f6taverken\u2019s chief of structural design, \u201ceven then she should be able to float.\u201d At his drawing board, Liden conceived a rig that would remain buoyant in 100-knot winds, in 100-metre-high waves, even after being hit by, say, a fuel tanker. For improved stability, the new rig would be squatter, squarer and more symmetrical than the clumsily shaped, five-legged Kielland. Four-legged rigs had been built before, but were not then common. Inside G\u00f6taverken, which had built rigs to order but never before designed its own, Liden\u2019s creation was nicknamed \u201cthe Little Chair\u201d. G\u00f6taverken wanted $65m to build the rig for a client (about $180m today), and a first order was placed in 1981 by a maritime firm in Oslo. Liden watched through his ninth-floor window at G\u00f6taverken headquarters, peering deep into the bed of the shipyard as a pair of 80m pontoons were constructed, each in a dry dock. Four circular stumps were built, each the size of pitched-over ferris wheels, added to in pie\u2011quarter portions, to make the rig\u2019s legs. In 1982, the half-made rig was set afloat, and a multi-layered box of steel was craned into place to form the deck. Jutting struts, front and back, were strung with lifeboats. A 49m derrick was erected. By now the rig reached higher than Liden\u2019s ninth-floor window. By 1983 it was ready for delivery, and its owners in Oslo promptly chartered the rig for several years to Saga Petroleum, a Norwegian firm that assumed naming rights. In her early years, the rig was known as Treasure Saga. A picture of her, freshly orange and resplendent, made the cover of one industry magazine. Here was a rig, wrote the trade press, \u201cfor the 90s\u201d. Liden and his colleagues expected their creation would last longer than that. In fact, the rig outlasted both the shipyard in which she was built (G\u00f6taverken closed in 1990) and the oil company she was first leased to (Saga was absorbed by a rival in 1999). Treasure Saga was bought by Transocean in 1998 and rechristened Transocean Winner. She was leased for months and years at a time on contracts to drill in North Sea oil fields, many of which had been given mythological names such as Asgard and Midgard, but which held in their depths somewhat more earthly riches. In 1969, a rig called Ocean Viking had been idly and unhopefully prospecting in this region, when a worker named Stale Salvensen, down on the drill floor enjoying a sly cigarette, smelled the distinctive, sour scent of unprocessed crude. By the time a superior was summoned from his cabin, there was so much oil sloshing around Viking\u2019s lower deck that Salvensen\u2019s boss slipped and fell in his pyjamas. And thus, ingloriously, a continent got its oil industry. The North Sea has been profitably drilled ever since, with exploration rights shared between its bordering countries, Norway, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Winner achieved some fame, in 2010, for striking the year\u2019s biggest find, a reservoir in the Norwegian sector that yielded many hundreds of millions of barrels. Hadar Liden had retired by then. He was living in Gothenburg when I called him at his home, in the autumn, not long after Winner\u2019s grounding. I asked the 88-year-old if he had thought about his rig at all, since seeing it off out of G\u00f6taverken, and he said: \u201cOh, always.\u201d Liden could recall in detail the proportion of high-tension steel that made up Winner\u2019s overall weight (48%), and the mill in Sweden this steel had come from (Oxel\u00f6sund, on the Baltic Sea). He found it harder to grasp just how much life had been lived aboard his Little Chair over three decades \u2013 the birthday cakes and Christmases, the bingo games and barbecues. Every evening she spent on board in the 1980s and 90s, a geologist named Brit Riise Fredheim would take a walk around the rim of the upper deck, and afterwards climb the derrick, for the exercise and the view. Of watching North Sea sunsets from Winner\u2019s pinnacle, Fredheim said: \u201cI felt like I owned the world.\u201d The oil rig had a gym, and one year they brought on board a running machine. The crew got a slow satellite internet service. \u201cWe watched movies and farted and laughed together,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Arctander said. He had been the rig\u2019s unofficial counsellor, reassuring colleagues when the isolation of offshore life got overwhelming. \u201cMany times,\u201d said Arctander, \u201cgrown men came into my office and started to cry. My wife cannot believe this.\u201d Liden was unaware of Winner\u2019s trials in Scotland: the storm, the grounding, and how, after lengthy relief work to tow the rig out of Dalmore Bay, Winner had seemed to vanish again, her reappearance after a 50-mile circumnavigation of Lewis dramatically delayed because of fears she would capsize. The rig eventually arrived in Broad Bay on the east of Lewis two days behind schedule, crewed by exhausted salvors who had hardly slept. While I told Liden about this, he listened patiently, with sympathy. Then the retired chief of structural design asked if I thought the rig had got into difficulties because of her structure. I said I thought not \u2013 that, if anything, her essential strength had prevented a worse disaster. \u201cGood,\u201d said Liden, \u201cgood.\u201d * * * Broad Bay The rig had been in Broad Bay for five weeks. Before dawn one morning in September, a salvage master called Sylvia Tervoort stood next to the boot of her car, putting on her work clothes in the dark. Half a mile over her shoulder, illuminated by onboard lights, Winner bobbed at anchor. Tervoort, a slight 38-year-old Dutchwoman from Castricum near Amsterdam, was quickly encased in bulky safety wear. Her padded orange coat was streaked all over with crusted oil. These streaks, she explained, were traceable back to some wild maritime calamity. There was the sunken rig she had helped raise in Alaska. The scuppered bulk carrier refloated in India. A pair of collided cargo ships (one carrying explosives) that had to be separated off Greece. For months in 2012 and 2013, Tervoort had hiked over the exposed hull of Costa Concordia, the Italian cruiseship that ran aground off the coast of Tuscany. Tervoort had for many years worked for the Dutch salvage firm SMIT, the only female salvage master at the company \u2013 and perhaps, she thought, in the world. She had never encountered another woman in such a position, and she had been all over: to South America, to Africa, deep out in the Atlantic \u2013 wherever a stricken vessel came to occupy the uncertain middle ground between serviceable craft and sea junk, she had been called to attend. Whether she was there to bring a craft back to life, or to siphon off its environment-threatening pollutants before a spill, or simply to strip a ship of its tangible riches before it sank, depended on the situation and the wants of her contractor in each case. Tervoort put on a helmet and moved towards a motorboat that would take her and her team out to Winner in the bay. For this job, SMIT had been contracted by Transocean to oversee the curious work of fixing up a maimed and ailing rig, in order that that it might resume its voyage to be destroyed absolutely. Tervoort was \u201cnot interested in the politics\u201d \u2013 as with the grounded fuel carrier she had dragged off a beach in Morocco, and the flaming cargo ship her team had boarded at sea, \u201ca job\u2019s a job. If people are happy making the signature on my salary, it\u2019s OK.\u201d As a salvage master, she tended to think about troubled vessels in binary terms. If not \u201cassets\u201d still afloat, then \u201cwrecks\u201d. She knew the transition from asset to wreck could be lethally quick, and a consequence of either impatience or overcaution by salvors. With Winner, Tervoot had prescribed caution rather than haste \u2013 much to the frustration, I was told, of authorities, who would have preferred to see the rig leave Scotland as quickly as possible. Tervoort would not be hurried. She had once spent a month in the hold of a stranded bulk carrier off Cuba, without the means to wash, except when a rainstorm gathered, at which point she trotted up on to deck in her bikini. Her life as a salvor seemed to require that she be in possession of a crazy array of skills: seamanship, engineering, calculus, rope climbing, parkour, mild piracy, among others. More than anything, though, the work demanded composure and courage, plus a total lack of awe about outsized seacraft. Civilians crane their necks and coo at large ships. Tervoort saw only assets \u2013 and moreover, assets that itched to become wrecks. It was in my capacity as a neck-craner that I had followed Winner to the Hebrides, getting as close to the rig as I could, which was never that close. Tervoort\u2019s team arrived in the car park, bussed in from the north of the island where they had been billeted at Transocean\u2019s expense in a holiday lodge. While they boarded the motorboat, I asked Tervoort if I could sail out with them. Get up close, see the rig. Tervoort replied, levelly, \u201cNo.\u201d As the boat sped away, I could hear her tease her team about the cold. The sun had started to rise, turning Winner a striking crimson. On a hillside to the east of the bay, I met a pair of hikers who were admiring the rig and counting the support vessels that floated near her. The most impressive of these vessels, a heavy-lifting ship called Hawk, was one of the largest in her class \u2013 really preposterously large, with an awesome rectangular deck that was something like the size of a Pall Mall or a Piccadilly to Winner\u2019s Trafalgar Square. Hawk had been ordered to the Hebrides from Singapore. Most of the smaller boats around her were chartered from Lewis. James Morrison, one of the hikers, itemised the mini economic boom that had bobbed in to Lewis with the rig: day rates for sailors, hotels booked out, all those minicab minutes ferrying oil execs back and forth from the airport. As sun and drizzle conspired to form a rainbow over Broad Bay, Morrison pointed out that, for a moment, Winner seemed to float at the end of it. During the weeks of the rig\u2019s stay on Lewis, there had been an unbargained-for turn in public opinion. Though initially seen as a poised steel spider, and a possible environmental threat, residents had by and large become fond of Winner. In pubs and on coastal paths, they discussed the progress of Tervoort\u2019s salvage with an easy familiarity, as they did weather or tides. \u201cEvery day you look at it,\u201d said Norman Macdonald, a taxi driver. \u201cWherever you drive round this part of the island, you look for the rig, to see how it\u2019s doing.\u201d When I called to book a room at a B&amp;B, the proprietor asked if I\u2019d like \u201ca room with a rig view\u201d. In a Lewis primary school, pupils made cardboard models of Winner, and Tervoort was invited to visit and judge them. If islanders had developed a coy affection for the oil rig, they had become openly adoring of the salvage master, and Tervoort rapidly advanced to local celebrity status. She was invited to take part in the island\u2019s fun-run. She gave a hit lecture at a local university, about a salvor\u2019s life. It was Tervoort\u2019s opinion that Winner would never survive being towed any serious distance, certainly not to the Mediterranean as planned, and so efforts were directed to get the rig on to the back of the heavy-lifting ship, Hawk. In a complicated process that would involve Hawk sinking herself into the water, drifting beneath the rig and then rising again, Winner would have to be lifted up and carried out of Scotland. They call this dry-towing. It happened in early October, after several false starts. Conditions had to be just right for Hawk to submerge and re-emerge, and islanders had several times gathered at vantage points to wave the rig away, only for the departure to be called off because of bad weather. In the end, on 6 October, Winner left Lewis unobserved, stealing away in the dark, her departure as abrupt and even as dashing as her arrival. \u201cI miss her,\u201d said Laura Carse, the Dalmore surfer. * * * Malta Strapped to Hawk, Winner moved south. She passed the outstretched fingers of mainland Scotland and patiently negotiated the busy shipping lanes of the Irish Sea. On 9 October the crafts passed the mouth of the Channel and then picked up speed, ripping through the Bay of Biscay in the better part of a day. After a fortnight at sea, both vessels had passed by Spain and Portugal and were in horn-hailing distance of Africa. They sailed between Tangier and Gibraltar and into the Alboran Sea, then pressed on past Sardinia and into the Mediterranean. Standing tall on the deck of her carrier ship, Winner looked as cool and improbable as a heron crossing water on the back of a paddling hippo. Hawk and Winner made Maltese waters on 25 October, dropping anchor off the capital, Valletta. High in the water as she was, Winner was easily visible over the square, stone rooftops of this ancient city, and she drew many Maltese to the seafront. A sightseers\u2019 boat, known as a luzzu, freighted with tourists, was piloted closer for a look. At anchor in Malta, repair work was carried out on the rig\u2019s damaged pontoons, while her owners exchanged export permissions with various authorities. Otherwise, Winner basked. It was bright and hot in the Mediterranean, and this old rig, once so profoundly chilled by North Sea winters that her steel would be painful to touch, at last warmed through. The Times of Malta sent a photographer to snap a northern celebrity come south to sunbathe. Carmel Pule, a retired professor of engineering, and also a keen sailor and ship-spotter, trained binoculars on Winner from the roof of his home. The 77-year-old had seen countless vessels come and go, Malta being a popular stopping point for shipping enterprise of every sort, and brisk handling of maritime paperwork a key part of the island economy. Pule could not recall seeing an oil rig come in piggy-back before. He got on his motorbike and rode to the coast. \u201cNot beautiful to look at as individual craft,\u201d he told his wife that evening, describing the trussed-together Winner and Hawk. But an appealing couple, \u201ctogether for the sake of convenience, or a temporary love affair\u201d. Pule did it, I did it \u2013 we do this, as humans, we humanise seacraft. Vessels are christened under bottles of fizz. They\u2019re given nicknames and ascribed character. Months after disembarking Winner for the last time, her crew could describe for me with precision, as if they were established personality traits, the rig\u2019s distinctive pitch and roll, the chatter of her anchor chains in wind, the subtle but thrilling smell of helicopter fuel that came through the ventilation system to let them know a batch of letters and newspapers had arrived. Meanwhile, in Malta, Pule kept a vigil on Winner from his roof, and sent me long emails in which he ruminated on the rig\u2019s visible old age, on her retirement, on an end to the obvious usefulness of things; he did not always register a distinction between the vessel\u2019s state and his own. Seacraft engender affinity, and perhaps only those who are obliged to take a wider perspective can remain entirely unromantic about them. The master salvor Sylvia Tervoort, who tended to meet vessels when something had gone dreadfully wrong with them, considered my question about whether she felt any affection towards the craft she had worked on and said: \u201cMaybe if this was a movie.\u201d When I spoke with Patrizia Heidegger of Shipbreaking Platform, she stressed that her organisation was concerned with the humanitarian and environmental burden of shipbreaking. As such, she was politely unenthusiastic about too much sentiment being spent on the boats. On 24 October, a day before Winner\u2019s arrival in Malta, Transocean had put out a statement to investors, confirming her sale as scrap. The company added that the rig would now be dismantled; \u201crecycled\u201d was their word. In describing a great, curling route out of Scandinavia, west and then south and then east (east, east) to the Med, Winner had passed 18 EU-approved facilities for shipbreaking, including those in Fosen in Norway, Grenaa in Denmark, Lowestoft in England, Bordeaux in France, Ghent in Belgium and Vinaroz in Spain. Unwanted sea junk does not often find its way to Europe, or stay long there. Had Winner been a fixed-drill platform, built into northern bedrock, exacting regulations and conventions would have insisted that this structure be dismantled and recycled in place. When an oil rig has an engine and a propeller, however \u2013 when she is classed as a vessel; a mobile she, not a stationary it \u2013 regulations can be outdistanced. Berths can be sought where conventions are not quite so stringent. And to sail a condemned vessel east from Europe is to adjust the financials of a demolition substantially. A secondhand vessel is currently worth about $190 per tonne to a shipbreaking yard in Turkey, a price established by the local market in reclaimed steel. Sail on to China and a different market, and the same metal is worth $210 per tonne. At breakers\u2019 yards in Alang in India, Chittagong in Bangladesh and Gadani in Pakistan, they will pay around $280 per tonne. Meanwhile, at the EU-approved shipbreaking sites, which are bound to conform to continental waste laws, and where vessels are dismantled in closed-off quays or dry docks, rates are less competitive: European yards offer zero dollars per tonne, and, in fact, tend to ask a fee to take a shipowners\u2019 junk. Of the 864 vessels that were dismantled around the world last year, nine were dismantled in Europe. Give or take a dozen (sent to Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and South Korea), the remainder went to breaking yards in Turkey, China, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The NGO Shipbreaking Platform has for some years tracked the movements of surplus ships to these sites, finding it necessary, over time, to start documenting human as well as vessel expiry. They add to their records the blunt, dire summaries of a tragedy every time a shipbreaker is killed in an accident anywhere in the world. Chaudhry Baliram Indrajit, crushed by a crane in Alang in January 2016. Muhammad Asif, killed by fire in Gadani in March 2016. Shibbir Ahmed and Jalal Uddin, both of whom fell to their deaths in Chittagong in July 2016. There are dozens of such deaths every year, the majority of them in yards in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, where men and boys pick apart vessels without appropriate tools or safety equipment, assuming terrific risks. As Winner underwent repairs in Malta, that October, the tally of acknowledged deaths in 2016 stood at 30, all in yards in south Asia. Of those 864 vessels sent for demolition that year, 668 went to yards in that region. \u201cThe incentive is to go to south Asia,\u201d said Patrizia Heidegger of Shipbreaking Platform, \u201cbecause the highest price paid per tonne is there.\u201d Whether individual shipowners took up that incentive depended, in her view, on a moral-financial reckoning. How much they cared about profits, as against how much they cared. \u201cThe reason you have owners going to beaches in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is money,\u201d said Petter Heier, head of Grieg Green, a subsidiary of the Norwegian maritime group Grieg established to promote and advise on responsible shipbreaking. Since 2010, Heier has sought to persuade divesting owners to send their excess to one of a group of vetted breaking yards in Turkey and China, rather than the higher-paying, less-audited yards in south Asia. Heier continued: \u201cThere are major accidents in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh every week. No company wants to be associated with that. So they sell through middlemen. They change the name of their vessels. They try to hide their [radar] tracking.\u201d These evasions infuriate the watchdog groups in their efforts to hold a shadowy industry to account, but do not always scuttle them. For instance, Shipbreaking Platform had laboriously tracked through its final movements a German-owned cargo ship called HS Colon, which happened to arrive in Malta at the same time as Winner. While at anchor in the Mediterranean, HS Colon disappeared. When the NGO caught up with her, she had undergone a brisk identity change, shedding the initials that linked her to her former owners, Hansa Treuhand, and was heading for Alang under the name of Colo. That month, a tanker called Gaz Fountain was bought for scrap by a yard in Gadani. Before she sailed, Gaz Fountain became Rain. On 9 January this year, Rain caught fire during demolition on a Pakistani beach, killing five workers. A few weeks earlier, in November, another ship had exploded at Gadani, killing at least 27 workers. Still astride Hawk, Winner left Maltese waters on 27 October. She moved east towards Crete and wove between a scattering of Aegean islands. She was bound for Turkey, and a place on its west coast called Aliaga, where the Turkish shipbreaking industry is based. This was an expensive choice of destination by Transocean. Around $80 or $90 per tonne in value had been foregone, more than $1m in total, compared with what might have been wrangled for Winner from a yard in south Asia. Petter Heier at Grieg Green said he believed that \u2013 slowly, gradually \u2013 owners such as Transocean were coming to acknowledge the longer-term, intangible gains of careful disposal, even if this meant shorter-term, tangible loss. \u201cInsurance companies are putting pressure on shipowners to recycle responsibly. Their employees are putting pressure. Society is putting pressure.\u201d In the case of Transocean, Heier offered an opinion (\u201ca personal opinion\u201d) that the company was further influenced in its thinking by its involvement in the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe. When it exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Deepwater Horizon was contracted, notoriously, to BP. But it was Transocean\u2019s rig. \u201cI would guess Deepwater Horizon triggered something,\u201d Heier said. \u201cThey are very careful [now], that if something happens with them on the beach in India, Bangladesh or Pakistan, that might ruin their name in the market.\u201d When I expressed surprise that Winner should have departed Malta still a Winner, without a change of identity in the manner of Colon or Gaz Fountain, Heier said: \u201cThey didn\u2019t change the name because they didn\u2019t need to hide anything. They chose a good yard.\u201d * * * Aliaga They lit up the shore with flares on the day the rig came in at Aliaga. This was to acknowledge the end of a three-week journey that had ended up taking three months, and to show a pack of tugboats \u2013 now that Winner was off the submerged Hawk and being pulled and pushed towards the beach \u2013 just where to put her. The float-off took place at lunchtime on 5 November. Winner had a token crew again: representatives from Transocean and SMIT back aboard for the final tow. Guiding flares on the shore, at least from Winner\u2019s deck, appeared only as spots of fire among hundreds. Aliaga beach was aflame \u2013 in the shallows, where carcasses of ships and rigs were disassembled by spark-showering blowtorches, and in the narrow yards beyond, where amputated pieces were further torched. Dense smoke filled the air above the yards. From the water, it must have appeared to the uninitiated that Aliaga had been freshly, plentifully bombed; perhaps doused and jumbled by tidal waves, too. In fact, this was a normal working day on the beach. At its western edge, a Del Monte fruit boat had been perfectly halved. To the east was a cargo carrier, Modern Express, that had some months earlier been abandoned by her crew while stricken and drifting in the Bay of Biscay. Nearby were two demobbed frigates, recently owned by the Spanish navy. Winner was put in next to the halved Del Monte boat, on a part of the beach owned by a local shipbreaking company called Isiksan. Isiksan\u2019s foreman, a muscular 30-year-old Istanbulite named H\u00fcsseyin Essen, sailed out to meet the rig. Essen had been the foreman here when Isiksan accepted its first oil rig for demolition, in early 2015. Ocean Concord had shown up 200 metres from the shore, and when Essen and his colleagues sailed out to meet her, they had no idea what to do next. Ever since they started shipbreaking in Aliaga in the 1970s, vessels had been brought ashore using a method known as \u201cbeaching\u201d; that is, they were piloted inland and made to mount the beach at speed. (Trembling phone footage from 2013 of a ferry being beached in an explosion of smoke and water has been viewed more than 3m times on YouTube.) With the sterns half-ashore, breakers could then cut in and dismantle the ships laterally, as a snacker might eat through a baguette. But oil rigs were not fast enough or strong enough for beaching. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what the hell we were going to do,\u201d Essen said. There was an idea to work on Concord at sea. In the end, heavy chains were tied around her legs and connected via winches to powerful vehicles on the shore. Concord was hauled through the shallows like a struggling fish. Through many oil rig landings since, this method had proved fine. Winner, towed and carried and storm-propelled on this fantastically harried trip east, would be dragged the last metres by straining bulldozers. Unlike the colossal breakers\u2019 beaches of south Asia, or the disparate yards scattered around coastal China, Turkish shipbreaking is packed close in one place, concentrated entirely on this government-allotted mile of coast on the outskirts of Aliaga. The beach here has been divided into as many slim, neighbouring yards as will fit \u2013 25 of them. Considering its comparative scale, Aliaga should be a minor consumer of the world\u2019s excess sea-tonnage. But since Ocean Concord arrived 18 months ago, it has established itself, improbably, as the world\u2019s foremost consumer of oil rigs. Something like 300,000 tonnes of unwanted rig had been brought here \u2013 Hunter and Yatzy and JW McLean and John Shaw and Southern Cross and Aleutian Key and Amirante and Scarabeo 4 and Arctic I and Arctic III \u2013 as well as that pair of young Enscos, the two rigs that were barely a decade old when they were sent by their owners for disposal. The Isiksan yard, its opening on to the Aegean no wider than an average-sized rig, had undertaken most of the demolitions. Petter Heier of Grieg Green, which advised Transocean on these latter stages of the disposal, said Isiksan had been chosen because of this expertise. It was expertise hard-won. Essen and his colleagues learned over the months that the best way to scrap a rig was to deposit a group of blowtorchers on the upper deck (carrying them there in a crane-hoisted cage) and then to let them burn their way downwards. The process took months, but because more men could get at more vessel on a rig than on a beached ship, and because rigs tended to have cranes that could be co-opted into the effort of self-destruction, Essen\u2019s scrappers were getting faster and faster at their work. With Winner, they targeted the helipad first, weakening it with blowtorches before a crane came in to pick it clean away. Winner\u2019s galley went next, then half her accommodation block. A fortnight into the demolition, the horizontal decks were still in place, but the walls between had been so gnawed at that Winner looked liked one of the cut-away diagrams sketched by Hader Liden at his drawing board decades earlier. The rig\u2019s sale to Isiksan was formalised and finalised the moment she came off the back of Hawk. In the words of Isiksan\u2019s young chief, a 26-year-old Aliagan named Soner Sari, Winner was a \u201ccooked meal\u201d, in that she had been brought to the yard whole and the workers there only had to digest her. They did this by cutting 50-tonne pieces off her, lifting these pieces into the yard, where the steel could be separated from everything else, then trucking off this valuable metal in one-metre-squared pieces that would be sold to a foundry nearby. Not all vessels in Aliaga were \u201ccooked meals\u201d. Other deals struck by Sari specified that Isiksan must fetch unwanted craft from wherever they had outlasted their use. These agreements, known in the industry as \u201ccash-buyer\u201d deals, could be profitable \u2013 but they were also risky. Early in 2016, an old ship called Bannock had been cash-bought by Sari from her owners in Italy. Sailed into the Matapan Sea, bound for Aliaga, Bannock had quickly listed and capsized, ceasing to exist in the old-fashioned way, by sinking to the bottom. \u201cThat was a shitty feeling,\u201d Sari said. We were sitting in his office on the yard, watching the slow destruction of Winner through a picture window. Boyish, dark, smartly dressed, Sari sometimes threw out his hands when he spoke, showing a bracelet on each wrist, one of them decorated with pictures of turtles. He had a Range Rover parked outside, in which we had driven together from central Aliaga, passing various chemical factories, oil refineries and foundries. Closer to the breakers\u2019 beach, an informal flea market of maritime bric-a-brac had been established, where traders sold recovered items from the dismantled ships. Sari continued: \u201cWhen we buy in a faraway port it\u2019s cheaper, because we\u2019re taking certain risks, and if it works out, we\u2019ll we make money for taking those risks.\u201d On his phone he had photographs of Bannock sinking. \u201cAt that point, your company\u2019s $20m \u2013 or whatever you\u2019ve paid \u2013 is gone. Poof. It hurts.\u201d Sari did not want to say exactly how much Isiksan had paid Transocean for the right to scrap Winner. Estimating based on local market rates, it could have been as much as $3.5m, though Sari only allowed that it was a seven-figure sum, and that Isiksan expected to turn a profit on the recovered steel. Parts other than a rig\u2019s steel could also be valuable to a breaking firm \u2013 for instance, any deck cranes that were in resellable condition. The lifeboats that came stitched to vessels could also be sold on to the bric-a-brac guys beyond the yard. Hundreds waited to be sold there, bordering the road like giant orange crash barriers. Through Sari\u2019s office window, we looked at a newly removed piece of Winner\u2019s accommodation block, which had just been brought up into the yard. It might once have been a section of corridor, and electric cabling and insulation foam still clung to its steel walls. A hydraulic excavator started tossing and rolling it in the dirt \u2013 cartwheeling it over and over to shake away the wire and the foam. By the end of the day, Sari judged, that steel would be on a foundry floor. About $3,000 worth, he said, pricing it by eye. While we drank strong, tarry coffee, we discussed the environmental consequences of shipbreaking. It was no coincidence, Sari said, that Aliaga\u2019s yards were huddled up beside refineries and foundries. Heavy industry had been moved to Aliaga en masse in the 1970s, \u201cbecause the government wanted to wrap it up in one area, keep everything else nice\u201d. Sari acknowledged that the local yards had not always upheld the strictest standards when it came to minimising environmental damage, but he was working to change that. Beneath the Isiskan yard he had installed a drainage system to catch and pump off pollutants. Down in the water there were brightly coloured booms, bobbing in a circle around Winner\u2019s legs, there in theory to stop any floating waste from getting out into the Aegean. A confidential 2015 report by the shipping consultancy Litehauz, obtained by journalists from the investigative agency Danwatch last year, detailed the potential impact of ships that were torch-cut on tidal water. The report estimated that for every 10,000 tonnes of vessel torched, about 120 tonnes of molten steel and two tonnes of chipped-away paint escaped into the sea. Sari insisted that the water off Isiksan\u2019s yard was regularly tested for pollutants. When I asked if he would swim out there, he thought for a moment and answered: \u201cWhy not?\u201d Petter Heier of Grieg Green said his company had audited the Isiksan yard and found its environmental procedures acceptable. Look, Sari said, it might be distasteful, but somebody had to get rid of shipowners\u2019 garbage. He gestured at the yard through the window. In his view, it was better that it happened out there than on the deadly beaches of Alang or Chittagong. He had applied for European recognition for the Isiksan yard, hoping to see it added to a list of EU-approved shipbreaking sites. * * * The shipbreaking yard We took a walk together through the yard, where the immediate noise was at first so much to contend with \u2013 the guttural, football-crowd \u201cOoooh!\u201d of ignited blowtorches, the grating complaint of metal on metal, bulldozer rumbles, generator whines \u2013 that I put off the matter of sights until a second lap. In the reddish-brown dust, fine as powder in places, a combination of soil and dirt and tiny coloured chips of paint, I found a Norwegian chocolate bar called a Stratos, still in its packaging. Nearby was a plastic shoehorn, apparently flung from the cartwheeling corridor, and a takeaway menu from a Chinese restaurant in Lewis. The discoveries increased in size \u2013 a gas mask, a boot, a barrel on fire, a pile of fire extinguishers, a larger mountain of green and white foam \u2013 until we were standing beside great, upright sections of mud pipe, tall enough for a person to walk through, cut into giant, swiss-roll slices and now being lifted into the bed of a truck. Early in Winner\u2019s demolition, a big, square piece of her decking, like the mat of a boxing ring, had been retained because it was flat and smooth and would skim briskly through the dusty yard when dragged behind a bulldozer. It now served as a carrying palette for the rig\u2019s disparate amputations, and brought sliding up from the shore an entire utility closet, placed upside down. An equipment rack on the closet\u2019s outer wall was slung with vices, chains and thick bolts the size of milk bottles. A sign above the inverted door warned that it might close violently at sea. When I tried to step inside, Sari said: \u201cUh, don\u2019t go in there yet.\u201d He indicated that parts of the room were so freshly torched that they were still smouldering. Airhorns sounded: lunch. I walked among yellow-helmeted breakers \u2013 about 70 of them were rostered to work today \u2013 as they streamed off Winner. The men I met lived locally. They said they earned wages of about $1,300 a month. According to investigations by Asli Odman, a member of Labour Watch Turkey, there had been at least 10 fatal accidents in the various yards of Aliaga since 2010. On the oil-refining ship Kuito, being dismantled at a neighbouring yard in 2015, a worker fell into the hold and died. On the cruise ship Pacific, dismantled by Izmir Ship Recycling Co in 2013, two workers were poisoned by carbon monoxide. I asked a 31-year-old Isiksan employee named Zafer Erdem, who operated a crane, whether he felt any fear whenever the next new rig arrived for demolition. No, said Erdem, when a rig came in he thought: work, two or three months of it. Erdem and his colleague Kamil Conge, a 45-year-old field manager, had a combined 30 years of experience on the beach. An inch beneath the dirt, Conge said, there was a layer of concrete that extended most of the way to the shore \u2013 a recent addition, before which the yard became a muddy horror whenever it rained. In those days, Conge said, a ship \u201ccould take a year to dismantle\u201d. I was told there had been injuries to workers in the Isiksan yard; accidental scorchings was the example given. Everyone remembered the recent death on Kuito, along the beach. Work stopped for a day in a show of respect. Not far from the mess hall, in the mud, I came across something colourful \u2013 a Norwegian consumer magazine, six years out of date and splayed open at an article about red wines. A 26-year-old yard worker called Omer Dogan, about to skip lunch and go to prayers at a nearby mosque, said they had sometimes found \u201cfunnier stuff\u201d on incoming oil rigs. Omer reddened, not wanting to say pornography. H\u00fcsseyin Essen told me he had many times come across collections of family photographs. Sari was once inspecting a brought-in trawler when he found a full outfit of ski gear in a cupboard. The Spanish frigates had come to Aliaga, he said, stripped of computers, but still with several missile launchers intact. Sari liked it best when they found a certain type of brass valve on ships. Isiksan owned a small foundry that processed non-ferrous metals, mostly salvaged bronze, which would be melted down and fashioned into storm valves, for resale to the shipbuilding industry. Sometimes, Isiksan\u2019s valves found their way back to Isiksan, got removed and were melted down again. I mentioned to Sari that I had met a man on the Isle of Lewis, an eccentric local professor called Arne V\u00f6gler, who had led a volunteer mission to scour the waters of Dalmore Bay after Winner had gone. V\u00f6gler, searching for debris that might harm the environment, had ended up fishing out Winner\u2019s enormous propeller. He joked to me about installing it as garden furniture. Hearing this, Sari raised an eyebrow. \u201cI wondered where that propeller had gone,\u201d he said, and sniffed. \u201cBrass alloy. Tell the guy he owes me $50,000.\u201d At the water\u2019s edge, the big steel carrying palette waited in the dirt. Sari stood on one of its upturned corners, hands in his pockets, bouncing on the flexible metal. The Aegean lapped at Winner\u2019s ruptured pontoons. From here I could see the intricate patterning of rust up the oil rig\u2019s legs \u2013 grades of peach, grey, green, black and bleach-white stains, recording, as if they were a sailor\u2019s tattoos, Winner\u2019s many tours in the North Sea. I knew from studying Hadar Liden\u2019s sketches that the thick legs were actually hollow, with ladders inside them to provide a route between the decks and the pontoons in case of emergency. In Aliaga, a doorway had been torched in one of these forward legs, and square windows cut at intervals up to the deck, so that when his workers climbed, Sari said, they didn\u2019t have to do so in the dark. I suggested that I try climbing up the inside of Winner myself. \u201cNo,\u201d said Sari. By this point I was accustomed to being refused requests to get aboard the rig. \u201cNo,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019ve tried going up by the ladder and it\u2019s like scaling a 10-storey building. Better take the cage.\u201d He signalled to an operator in a nearby crane, who answered by rotating and depositing on the shore a carry-cage about the size of a couple of telephone boxes, painted blood-red. I stepped inside and held on to the cage\u2019s central pole, like a commuter on a bus, as it was hoisted fast into the air, spinning through several terrible rotations before settling into a queasy, side-to-side sway. Before landing the cage on the rig, the crane swung me high and wide above the beach, so that for the first time I could see the full, fiery chaos of Aliaga. The fruit boats and frigates and oil rigs were not going quietly, but inchingly, they were going; and soon their berths on the shore would be filled by the next redundant or repented-of thing. Back in his office, I had asked Sari what would happen when the world\u2019s fleet had been adequately thinned, when there were no more superfluous rigs for him to buy and dismantle. He said he expected this to happen soon. \u201cNext year? The year after?\u201d As rigs disappeared, rates to hire the remaining ones would rise and, eventually, an incautious oil industry would find an economic (if not glowingly ethical) equilibrium. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll go looking for the next thing.\u201d Sari had in mind a smaller type of oil platform known as a jack-up, of which there were many hundreds filling the seas. \u201cCold-stacked all over, no jobs, no prospects of jobs \u2026\u201d I asked him if it ever seemed a pity to break up such monumental and characterful structures. Did he look at Winner in the way that I had come to look at her, in the way her former crew looked at her, as something dignified? Sari said the only emotion he could feel about Winner was relief, when she was gone, on schedule. But not long ago, he acknowledged, he had had a wobble. It was over those two young Ensco rigs \u2013 Ensco 6003 and 6004 \u2013 that had come out of Brazilian waters. When Sari won the right to scrap them, he took the unusual decision to sail the rigs under their own power from South America to Turkey. \u201cI piloted one myself, for the last mile to Aliaga. I wanted to try it out.\u201d Sari mimed adjusting thrusters, striking buttons. \u201cEverything was like new, all the controls.\u201d They demolished Ensco 6003 and 6004 over the course of about 10 weeks. \u201cBeautiful machines. Beautiful machines,\u201d Sari said. * * * On the Transocean Winner The cage was lowered on to Winner\u2019s deck, where it smelled of propane and singed steel, of grease and hydraulic fuel. Disorientatingly, here, the rig\u2019s insides were outside, so that a payphone that had once stood in the accommodation block was now upright and exposed in the open air. Two ping-pong balls, mysterious survivors of the long voyage, juddered on the payphone\u2019s coin shelf. Nearby, blowtorchers cut their way out from inside a cabin, and above them a deputation of breakers directed liquid from a hose into a vat marked \u201cChemical Spill\u201d. Thinking of the geologist Brit Fredheim, and her evening constitutionals around the rig, I set off to walk Winner\u2019s circumference. All along the perimeter fence were signs that ordered \u201cRespect this barrier\u201d, signs that continued until the barrier fell away completely, mangled, torn and disrespected by the storm back in the Hebrides. I moved towards the interior, passing pools of standing water on the corrugated floor, and crater-bursts of rust where it was dry. Someone had left a dozen eggs on the floor by a ladder. There were stacks of dusty computer towers in a cupboard, and orange lifejackets that filled two bath-sized tubs to the brim. In a windowless office, where there were two leather-effect chairs and a tacked-up poster of a motorbike, I found a whiteboard on which somebody had written \u201cCrew 6 says goodbye\u201d. Below, on a shelf, there was a leather-bound logbook, neatly filled with the signatures of men and women who had seen through a particular watch on Winner. There were pages and pages of names, going back to the early 1990s. I considered stealing the book, or adding my own signature. In the end, I put it back on the shelf, to be destroyed with the rest. Outside, I passed Zafer Erdem in his crane, merrily terrorising a piece of racking at the base of the derrick. We waved. By the end of November, Winner had been stripped of everything above the midriff, bar her derrick. This was pulled down on 3 December, then chained to bulldozers, which laboured until the tower toppled forward; instead of landing on an outstretched jetty that was meant to catch the pieces, it twisted and crashed pinnacle-first into the shallows. Once the pieces had been fished out, work resumed to reduce the rig\u2019s legs. By mid-December, Winner amounted to little more than a pair of pontoons under blackened stumps, the dwindling structure kept stable by thin strips of horizontal decking, so that it resembled a pair of ice skates strung together by the laces. By Christmas Day, only the pontoons were left. These were dragged out of the water and into the dirt so that another unwanted rig, Transocean Driller, could be parked on the slipway behind. Winner\u2019s port-side pontoon was sliced up and trucked away in the first days of January. Very likely, by this point, there were swirls of the rig\u2019s old steel in the refashioned blocks and beams that were leaving the local foundries, to be sold on for use in construction projects around the Turkish interior. On 5 January, something curious happened on Aliaga beach. Winner\u2019s final piece, her starboard pontoon, was half gone. Snow began to fall, rare in this part of Turkey, carrying on for four days and keeping the breakers from their work. A reprieve \u2013 days in which Winner was left out and unmolested, in weather she knew well. By the following week, the snow had gone and the cutting resumed. The last of the pontoon was lifted on to a truck on 13 January, and smelted that afternoon.

      "body": "<p>It was night, stormy, and the oil rig Transocean Winner was somewhere in the North Atlantic on 7 August 2016 when her tow-line broke. No crew members were on board. The rig was being dragged by a tugboat called Forward, the tethered vessels charting a course out of Norway that was meant to take them on a month-long journey to Malta. Within the offices of Transocean Ltd, the oil-exploration company that owned the rig, such a journey might have been described with corporate seemliness as an \u201cend-of-life voyage\u201d; but in the saltier language heard offshore, the rig was \u201cgoing for fucking razorblades\u201d \u2013 for scrap, to be dismantled in a shipbreaking yard east of Malta. In that Atlantic storm, several thousand miles from her intended destination, Winner floated free.</p> <p>The 33-year-old rig had never moved with so little constraint. Winner was huge \u2013 17,000 tonnes, like an elevated Trafalgar Square, complete with a middle derrick as tall as Nelson\u2019s Column, her four legs the shape of castle keeps; all this was borne up in the water on a pair of barge-sized pontoons \u2013 and its positioning had always been precisely controlled. While moored, she was held in place by eight heavy anchors. At other times, she was sailed with a pilot at the helm as if she were any other ship. When contracted to drill in the North Sea, as she had been since the 1980s, boring into the bedrock for hidden reservoirs of oil, Winner\u2019s anchors and underwater propellers worked together with her on-board computers to \u201cdynamically position\u201d her \u2013 that is, keep her very still. The men and women who formed Winner\u2019s crew \u2013 drillers and engineers and geologists and divers and cleaners and cooks, most of them Norwegian \u2013 imagined this rig to have a character that would resist such checks. They nicknamed her <em>Svanen</em>, or Swan, because to them she was both elegant and unyielding. Scheduled as she was for destruction, Winner could not have chosen a better moment to bolt.</p> <p>The master on the tugboat Forward radioed for help. Through a series of exchanges with Transocean, as well as with the British coastguard and Forward\u2019s owners, the Rotterdam-based ALP Maritime, the master explained his situation. Both tugboat and rig had been caught in heavy weather while circumnavigating the Hebrides, sailing a mile and a half off the Scottish islands. It turned into the worst summer storm in the region for years, with winds of 40 knots and waves 10 metres high. Throughout the afternoon of 7 August, Forward and Winner were tossed on a course running parallel with the coast of Lewis, one of the outermost Hebridean islands. For a time it seemed they would be sent on by, still fettered to each other, still Mediterranean-bound. But in the early evening the wind changed direction, and Forward and Winner \u2013 or more accurately, Winner and Forward, given that the rig was now acting as a huge metal sail and comfortably tugging her own tugboat \u2013 were forced landward. It was around 4am when the master radioed to confirm that the tow-line had snapped.</p> <p>Winner had, for all of her life, been painted bright orange. The colour had become chipped and rust-stained over time, but was still vivid in daylight, visible for miles. In the storm, the rig disappeared completely. Radar data from those early-morning hours showed Forward moving back and forth in the water off Lewis, as if retracing steps for something misplaced. It was agreed between Transocean, ALP, the coastguard and other emergency authorities that Winner was irretrievable. Everybody would wait until sunrise, and see.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2017/may/12/where-oil-rigs-go-to-die-podcast\">Where oil rigs go to die \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Stavanger</h2> <p>The world has a problem with its oil rigs. There are too many of them, and for the first time since the earliest manufacture of seaborne drilling platforms 50 or 60 years ago, decisions are being made about how and where to get rid of them in number. That there should be a sudden surplus is vexing for those invested in undersea drilling: as recently as 2010 the rigs were thought too few. Back then, had an oil company such as Shell or BP or Marathon wanted to dig down and discover what was lying beneath a particular patch of sea, it wasn\u2019t unusual for them to wait as long as a year until an exploration company such as Transocean or Diamond or Ensco had a rig available to lease to them. It was a time of undersupply. Dozens of new rigs were commissioned, and worldwide orders tripled between 2010 and 2011. But oil rigs take two or three years to build, and by the time these were ready for use, the price of oil had declined sharply, and with it the industry\u2019s hunger to prospect \u2013 thus the oversupply. Rigs without contracts to drill were either \u201ccold-stacked\u201d (anchored without crew) to wait for a market recovery, or sold for demolition. More than 40 oil rigs were waved off on end-of-life voyages in 2015, according to data gathered by a Brussels-based maritime NGO called Shipbreaking Platform; up from a single dispensed-with rig, so far as the NGO knew, in 2014.</p> <p>It was a hasty and disordered rebalancing of the global fleet, and not all the decisions made were sensible. In the spring of 2016, for instance, at about the time Transocean was considering whether or not to decommission Winner, its drilling rival Ensco sent away two rigs that were relatively new: built in 2004, and meant to bear 30 or 40 years of graft, but hurriedly euthanised after 12. Winner, by comparison, had lived long and busily. She was launched in 1983, and in the decades since had bobbed through market downturns and upturns, through winter hurricanes and underwater blowouts, and at least two on-board deaths. For the most part, Winner\u2019s 33 years at sea had been characterised by day after day of patient, repetitive work \u2013 the stuff that gives offshore life its rhythm and, for many, its special comfort. Drill supervisor Andr\u00e9 Arctander, a tanned greybeard from Stavanger in Norway, calculated that he had spent a third of his life on this rig. The colour of his boilersuit had changed, Arctander said, in accordance with the branding requirements of drilling clients, but he retained throughout a deeper loyalty to Winner and her regular crew \u201cthat went beyond corporate logos\u201d. He spoke of getting so in tune with the rig during his fortnight-long stints on board that he could fall asleep in his cabin and wake up knowing half of what had happened while he was under, just from having felt the changes in Winner\u2019s vibrations and having heard her machine-purrs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/15/transocean-winner-oil-platform-salvage-crew-isle-of-lewis\">Salvage crew boards stricken Transocean Winner oil platform</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In spring 2016, as Winner was nearing the end of an 11-month contract with Marathon to drill in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, rumours of her possible scrapping spread around the crew. In the rig\u2019s \u201csmoko\u201d rooms and coffee shops, they discussed the contradiction that underpinned their industry: while the price of oil might move up and down, shareholders in drilling companies tended to prefer numbers that moved in only one direction. It was difficult and expensive to maintain a cold-stacked rig. Winner had herself been cold-stacked once, and the crew\u2019s first task after reboarding was to snap away the icicles in their cabins. Meanwhile, there were immediate returns to be made by selling for scrap. \u201cIt would be better to have long-term plans and a buffer of funds to use during hard times,\u201d Arctander thought. \u201cBut this is not how it works.\u201d In July, Winner\u2019s scrapping was confirmed. A Norwegian crane operator posted a message on the rig\u2019s Facebook page: <em>\u201cMalta og spiker next</em>.\u201d Loosely translated, he meant: \u201cMalta next, then a furnace \u2013 somewhere.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"51370940379b5a46c6f1f917b3f025e4da3a8f6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51370940379b5a46c6f1f917b3f025e4da3a8f6c/0_0_4500_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Transocean Winner drilling rig off the coast of the Isle of Lewis after it ran aground in severe weather conditions. Tuesday August 9, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Transocean Winner drilling rig off the coast of the Isle of Lewis after it ran aground in severe weather conditions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is common for rigs on end-of-life voyages to be towed with their tracking systems switched off. On 3 August, Winner sent out a final blip from a fjord in southern Norway, near Stavanger, and then stopped sending a signal. The tugboat Forward then took her out into the North Sea. On 6 August, Winner entered the Atlantic, and the next day she was lost in the storm off the Hebrides. On 8 August, shortly before sunrise on the Isle of Lewis, the oil rig washed in with the tide.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Dalmore Bay</h2> <p>Her 17,000 tonnes came in on Dalmore Bay, one of the island\u2019s prettiest beaches, a quarter-mile crescent of bone-coloured sand and muscular swell that, on a normal Monday morning, could expect to be visited by dog-walkers, surfers, kayakers, seabirds, even dolphins. Back behind the sand, where the beach narrowed and formed an uneven track up to the coastal road, lay the gravestones of a hundred or so islanders. A fractional difference in the gusts and tides overnight, and the runaway Winner might have brought her great weight down on the resting place of one Malcolm MacCauley, whose grave was set closest to the water. As it was, the rig collided with the headland that defined Dalmore Bay\u2019s southern edge \u2013 a slope of marram grass busy with snails that rose to a boggy cliff and then fell away to rocks on the foreshore. Winner\u2019s pontoons scraped into the shallows and a strut of her crosswise steel snagged on a tall, tooth-shaped crag. The rig pitched to the south, away from the beach, her derrick cutting obliquely across the sky and her helipad inclining at an angle that to the human eye read as almost apologetic. However terrific a noise this made nobody was around to hear it, bar the seabirds and snails. The police started to arrive around 7am, as did the first stunned residents.</p> <p>Lewis is made of old, old rock. There is presumed to be Viking DNA coursing through the islanders, and it is a general trait of the community that its members be stoic and unhysterical, whatever difficulties \u2013 generally weather-borne \u2013 come this far north to trouble them. Perhaps there were some on Lewis that week who heard that an oil rig had struck and shrugged. But most who were mobile and even mildly curious put aside their habitual stoicism to make a trip to the beach and stare. \u201cOn Lewis?\u201d said Don MacKay, a fisherman. \u201cThis was seismic.\u201d</p> <p>When MacKay journeyed to Dalmore to see Winner, he was put in mind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/22/china-mieville-covehithe-short-story\">a steel spider, poised on the shore</a> as if plotting some sinister next move. Laura Carse, a surfer, felt it was like the time she returned home to find her house had been burgled. Not because Winner\u2019s presence struck her as violent, or a violation, \u201cbut because my brain could not quite manage the image\u201d. This was as if a church or a rollercoaster had suddenly manifested on the sand. Don MacKay said: \u201cYes. It took a wee bit of time to absorb the info.\u201d</p> <p>Winner\u2019s name was painted on her forward side, the black-on-yellow letters so large as to be crisply distinguishable from the shore \u2013 a scale that would only start to make sense to onlookers when emergency salvage workers boarded the rig, and it could be seen that each letter was about three humans tall. The first salvage mission to Winner was made by coastguard helicopter. A team of six were lowered one by one by winch to the deck of the rig, and were removed again by helicopter that evening. By Winner\u2019s second day in Dalmore, the weather made any more such airborne trips impossible. For a week the rig simply stayed where she was, unoccupied, her weight against the rocks. When the salvors got back on board, they did so by boat, sailing close enough to hop on to a pontoon and scale one of the rig\u2019s legs using ropes. It was not easy to go back and forth from rig to shore this way, so the team sequestered cabins and stayed aboard. One of them reported that, because of Winner\u2019s tilt, her bunks were uncomfortable to sleep in, at least until they removed the cabin doors and propped them horizontally beneath the mattresses.</p> <p>Tugboats and other support vessels now filled Dalmore Bay, waiting for the go-ahead to tow Winner off the rocks. Robotic diving units were sent underwater to collect images of the rig\u2019s pontoons. Both were badly damaged, one with a narrow triangular hole that was at least 10 metres from end to end, the metal drawn and furled at the base so that it resembled a heaved-open theatre curtain. Early visitors to Dalmore had reported a smell of fuel coming over the sands. Nobody in this part of the country could forget what had happened in the Shetlands in the early 1990s when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-20913560\">a tanker, Braer, foundered in a storm</a> off the islands\u2019 southern edge and disgorged many thousands of tonnes of crude oil into the water. There were fears of a similar spill from Winner, but the truth was that, although she was often referred to as an oil rig, Winner\u2019s real business was mud. During her decades at sea, Winner was generally a tunneller, commissioned to bore through layers of undersea rock and sludge, after which a purpose-built tanker would float in and slurp up any finds. It was estimated at the time of her grounding that Winner carried a few hundred tonnes of diesel fuel, kept in tanks in her pontoons. Some of this fuel had escaped through the tears in the pontoons. Salvors drained what remained into tanks on the surrounding support boats, and meanwhile concocted a plan to pump compressed air into the newly emptied pontoons. This would set Winner afloat again. She could then be towed off the headland on a high or rising tide, and dragged to a bay on the other side of Lewis, where it could be figured out how to make her properly seaworthy.</p> <p>What had begun as the quiet removal of Winner from Norway \u2013 a journey scarcely noticed by anyone outside the oil business \u2013 was now a richly public event. Nothing quite like it had happened in the Hebrides since the 1940s, when the cargo ship Politician, abundantly loaded with bottled spirits, ran aground on the nearby island of Eriskay. The local response on that occasion \u2013 an outrageous carrying-away of the booze \u2013 inspired a novel and a film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/28/whisky-galore-film-review\">Whisky Galore</a>. In the case of Winner, her plunder value existed in her bones \u2013 her predominantly steel frame \u2013 and it was residual value that would not be easily released; something to which Transocean could by now attest. It had in its fleet more rigs than any other drilling company \u2013 more than 70 in 2016 \u2013 and the earlier pruning of about a dozen of these vessels had been conducted with discretion. Now the sun was up on a fiasco.</p> <p>Dave Walls was one of the Transocean directors who flew to Lewis from the company\u2019s headquarters in Aberdeen. At a press conference on the island 11 days after the accident, Walls pledged that Winner would be recovered from the rocks and put her back on her journey east. \u201cWe will make right any damage,\u201d Walls said. Transocean later gave the Dalmore community \u00a3120,000 in reparations. A financial statement released by the oil company in November 2016 made clear the larger cost of the accident: at least $21m (\u00a316m). That month, on 21 November, Walls was asked at a parliamentary hearing about the circumstances leading up to Winner\u2019s nighttime escape. Why had the rig been pulled into a storm that was long forecast? Walls seemed to suggest that the master on the tugboat Forward had tried, in error, to outrun or outmuscle the Hebridean seas. (The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has been looking into the incident since the summer of 2016, and its report is expected later this year. In response to my request for comment, Transocean cited this ongoing investigation and declined to answer my questions about Winner. In a statement, Transocean added: \u201cWe will continue to meet our responsibilities arising out of this incident.\u201d)</p> <p>On Lewis, in the aftermath of the grounding, there were historically unprecedented traffic jams on the single-track road to the beach. Access was now forbidden, and a policeman guarded the junction. Arriving on the island, I made enquiries about getting aboard Winner and was told, roughly speaking, that I had about as much chance of getting on the whisky-carrying Politician, which had been on the bottom of the sea for 70 years. A restriction zone around Winner took in land, sea and air, so that hikers were forbidden to walk the fringing coastal paths and fishermen were told to putter their boats at a distance. On the evening of 22 August, allowances were made for a seismic local event, and islanders were permitted back to their beach to watch Winner be towed away. Around a hundred people came to watch, a shuttle bus running them down the beach road in shifts. A tea station was set up by volunteers. Midges hummed about. At 9pm the sun went down behind the rig, quite spectacularly, and after that the tow-lines between Winner and her tugs visibly tautened. The underwater pontoons were filled with compressed air. A shout went up on the shore: \u201cShe\u2019s on the move!\u201d There was a ripple of applause.</p> <p>As she came off the rocks, \u201cseemingly inch by inch\u201d, said Don MacKay, Winner continued to list very badly. She was towed north across the bay until hidden by a distant headland. There was another round of applause on the beach, then a polite rush for the first shuttle bus. MacKay was not sorry to see Winner go, he said, but like many of the islanders, he had become curious about the rig\u2019s fate and intended to follow her progress. Authorities had said they expected Winner to arrive on the eastern side of Lewis the next day, a Tuesday. But when MacKay checked that day, she had not yet appeared. He checked again early on Wednesday. Still no sign. The runaway rig had once more disappeared from public view.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Gothenburg</h2> <p>That Winner floated at all when she came off the rocks was the consequence of an old tragedy, half-forgotten by the summer of 2016, but rawly felt at the time of this rig\u2019s invention. In 1980, a North Sea rig called Alexander Kielland had been struck by savage winds that weakened one of its legs and, with lethal suddenness, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/27/newsid_2531000/2531091.stm\">caused it to list and capsize</a>. Of 212 crew, only 89 survived. North Sea rigs, it was ruled by British and Scandinavian authorities, must be fit to withstand such winds, and worse. That year, at the G\u00f6taverken Arendal shipyard in Gothenburg, Sweden, an engineer called Hadar Liden sketched Winner\u2019s shape on paper with these instructions in mind. \u201cIf she lost a leg on the water,\u201d recalled Liden, who in the 1970s and 80s was G\u00f6taverken\u2019s chief of structural design, \u201ceven then she should be able to float.\u201d At his drawing board, Liden conceived a rig that would remain buoyant in 100-knot winds, in 100-metre-high waves, even after being hit by, say, a fuel tanker. For improved stability, the new rig would be squatter, squarer and more symmetrical than the clumsily shaped, five-legged Kielland. Four-legged rigs had been built before, but were not then common. Inside G\u00f6taverken, which had built rigs to order but never before designed its own, Liden\u2019s creation was nicknamed \u201cthe Little Chair\u201d.</p> <p>G\u00f6taverken wanted $65m to build the rig for a client (about $180m today), and a first order was placed in 1981 by a maritime firm in Oslo. Liden watched through his ninth-floor window at G\u00f6taverken headquarters, peering deep into the bed of the shipyard as a pair of 80m pontoons were constructed, each in a dry dock. Four circular stumps were built, each the size of pitched-over ferris wheels, added to in pie\u2011quarter portions, to make the rig\u2019s legs. In 1982, the half-made rig was set afloat, and a multi-layered box of steel was craned into place to form the deck. Jutting struts, front and back, were strung with lifeboats. A 49m derrick was erected. By now the rig reached higher than Liden\u2019s ninth-floor window. By 1983 it was ready for delivery, and its owners in Oslo promptly chartered the rig for several years to Saga Petroleum, a Norwegian firm that assumed naming rights. In her early years, the rig was known as Treasure Saga. A picture of her, freshly orange and resplendent, made the cover of one industry magazine.</p> <p>Here was a rig, wrote the trade press, \u201cfor the 90s\u201d. Liden and his colleagues expected their creation would last longer than that. In fact, the rig outlasted both the shipyard in which she was built (G\u00f6taverken closed in 1990) and the oil company she was first leased to (Saga was absorbed by a rival in 1999). Treasure Saga was bought by Transocean in 1998 and rechristened Transocean Winner. She was leased for months and years at a time on contracts to drill in North Sea oil fields, many of which had been given mythological names such as Asgard and Midgard, but which held in their depths somewhat more earthly riches. In 1969, a rig called Ocean Viking had been idly and unhopefully prospecting in this region, when a worker named Stale Salvensen, down on the drill floor enjoying a sly cigarette, smelled the distinctive, sour scent of unprocessed crude. By the time a superior was summoned from his cabin, there was so much oil sloshing around Viking\u2019s lower deck that Salvensen\u2019s boss slipped and fell in his pyjamas. And thus, ingloriously, a continent got its oil industry. The North Sea has been profitably drilled ever since, with exploration rights shared between its bordering countries, Norway, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Winner achieved some fame, in 2010, for striking the year\u2019s biggest find, a reservoir in the Norwegian sector that yielded many hundreds of millions of barrels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/31/big-gamble-dangerous-british-betting-shops\">The big gamble: the dangerous world of British betting shops | Tom Lamont</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hadar Liden had retired by then. He was living in Gothenburg when I called him at his home, in the autumn, not long after Winner\u2019s grounding. I asked the 88-year-old if he had thought about his rig at all, since seeing it off out of G\u00f6taverken, and he said: \u201cOh, always.\u201d Liden could recall in detail the proportion of high-tension steel that made up Winner\u2019s overall weight (48%), and the mill in Sweden this steel had come from (Oxel\u00f6sund, on the Baltic Sea). He found it harder to grasp just how much life had been lived aboard his Little Chair over three decades \u2013 the birthday cakes and Christmases, the bingo games and barbecues. Every evening she spent on board in the 1980s and 90s, a geologist named Brit Riise Fredheim would take a walk around the rim of the upper deck, and afterwards climb the derrick, for the exercise and the view. Of watching North Sea sunsets from Winner\u2019s pinnacle, Fredheim said: \u201cI felt like I owned the world.\u201d The oil rig had a gym, and one year they brought on board a running machine. The crew got a slow satellite internet service. \u201cWe watched movies and farted and laughed together,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Arctander said. He had been the rig\u2019s unofficial counsellor, reassuring colleagues when the isolation of offshore life got overwhelming. \u201cMany times,\u201d said Arctander, \u201cgrown men came into my office and started to cry. My wife cannot believe this.\u201d</p> <p>Liden was unaware of Winner\u2019s trials in Scotland: the storm, the grounding, and how, after lengthy relief work to tow the rig out of Dalmore Bay, Winner had seemed to vanish again, her reappearance after a 50-mile circumnavigation of Lewis dramatically delayed because of fears she would capsize. The rig eventually arrived in Broad Bay on the east of Lewis two days behind schedule, crewed by exhausted salvors who had hardly slept. While I told Liden about this, he listened patiently, with sympathy. Then the retired chief of structural design asked if I thought the rig had got into difficulties because of her <em>structure</em>. I said I thought not \u2013 that, if anything, her essential strength had prevented a worse disaster. \u201cGood,\u201d said Liden, \u201cgood.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ccebc6f07cb4a4c97ef04907a44dced71df9e6fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccebc6f07cb4a4c97ef04907a44dced71df9e6fb/0_51_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The oil rig Transocean Winner being loaded on to the semi-submersible heavy-lifting ship Hawk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The oil rig Transocean Winner being loaded on to the semi-submersible heavy-lifting ship Hawk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heather Skull/Maritime and Coastguard Agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Broad Bay</h2> <p>The rig had been in Broad Bay for five weeks. Before dawn one morning in September, a salvage master called Sylvia Tervoort stood next to the boot of her car, putting on her work clothes in the dark. Half a mile over her shoulder, illuminated by onboard lights, Winner bobbed at anchor. Tervoort, a slight 38-year-old Dutchwoman from Castricum near Amsterdam, was quickly encased in bulky safety wear. Her padded orange coat was streaked all over with crusted oil. These streaks, she explained, were traceable back to some wild maritime calamity. There was the sunken rig she had helped raise in Alaska. The scuppered bulk carrier refloated in India. A pair of collided cargo ships (one carrying explosives) that had to be separated off Greece. For months in 2012 and 2013, Tervoort had hiked over the exposed hull of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/22/inside-costa-concordia-in-pictures\">Costa Concordia</a>, the Italian cruiseship that ran aground off the coast of Tuscany. Tervoort had for many years worked for the Dutch salvage firm SMIT, the only female salvage master at the company \u2013 and perhaps, she thought, in the world. She had never encountered another woman in such a position, and she had been all over: to South America, to Africa, deep out in the Atlantic \u2013 wherever a stricken vessel came to occupy the uncertain middle ground between serviceable craft and sea junk, she had been called to attend. Whether she was there to bring a craft back to life, or to siphon off its environment-threatening pollutants before a spill, or simply to strip a ship of its tangible riches before it sank, depended on the situation and the wants of her contractor in each case.</p> <p>Tervoort put on a helmet and moved towards a motorboat that would take her and her team out to Winner in the bay. For this job, SMIT had been contracted by Transocean to oversee the curious work of fixing up a maimed and ailing rig, in order that that it might resume its voyage to be destroyed absolutely. Tervoort was \u201cnot interested in the politics\u201d \u2013 as with the grounded fuel carrier she had dragged off a beach in Morocco, and the flaming cargo ship her team had boarded at sea, \u201ca job\u2019s a job. If people are happy making the signature on my salary, it\u2019s OK.\u201d As a salvage master, she tended to think about troubled vessels in binary terms. If not \u201cassets\u201d still afloat, then \u201cwrecks\u201d. She knew the transition from asset to wreck could be lethally quick, and a consequence of either impatience or overcaution by salvors.</p> <p>With Winner, Tervoot had prescribed caution rather than haste \u2013 much to the frustration, I was told, of authorities, who would have preferred to see the rig leave Scotland as quickly as possible. Tervoort would not be hurried. She had once spent a month in the hold of a stranded bulk carrier off Cuba, without the means to wash, except when a rainstorm gathered, at which point she trotted up on to deck in her bikini. Her life as a salvor seemed to require that she be in possession of a crazy array of skills: seamanship, engineering, calculus, rope climbing, parkour, mild piracy, among others. More than anything, though, the work demanded composure and courage, plus a total lack of awe about outsized seacraft. Civilians crane their necks and coo at large ships. Tervoort saw only assets \u2013 and moreover, assets that itched to become wrecks.</p> <p>It was in my capacity as a neck-craner that I had followed Winner to the Hebrides, getting as close to the rig as I could, which was never that close. Tervoort\u2019s team arrived in the car park, bussed in from the north of the island where they had been billeted at Transocean\u2019s expense in a holiday lodge. While they boarded the motorboat, I asked Tervoort if I could sail out with them. Get up close, see the rig. Tervoort replied, levelly, \u201cNo.\u201d As the boat sped away, I could hear her tease her team about the cold. The sun had started to rise, turning Winner a striking crimson.</p> <p>On a hillside to the east of the bay, I met a pair of hikers who were admiring the rig and counting the support vessels that floated near her. The most impressive of these vessels, a heavy-lifting ship called Hawk, was one of the largest in her class \u2013 really preposterously large, with an awesome rectangular deck that was something like the size of a Pall Mall or a Piccadilly to Winner\u2019s Trafalgar Square. Hawk had been ordered to the Hebrides from Singapore. Most of the smaller boats around her were chartered from Lewis. James Morrison, one of the hikers, itemised the mini economic boom that had bobbed in to Lewis with the rig: day rates for sailors, hotels booked out, all those minicab minutes ferrying oil execs back and forth from the airport. As sun and drizzle conspired to form a rainbow over Broad Bay, Morrison pointed out that, for a moment, Winner seemed to float at the end of it.</p> <p>During the weeks of the rig\u2019s stay on Lewis, there had been an unbargained-for turn in public opinion. Though initially seen as a poised steel spider, and a possible environmental threat, residents had by and large become fond of Winner. In pubs and on coastal paths, they discussed the progress of Tervoort\u2019s salvage with an easy familiarity, as they did weather or tides. \u201cEvery day you look at it,\u201d said Norman Macdonald, a taxi driver. \u201cWherever you drive round this part of the island, you look for the rig, to see how it\u2019s doing.\u201d When I called to book a room at a B&amp;B, the proprietor asked if I\u2019d like \u201ca room with a rig view\u201d. In a Lewis primary school, pupils made cardboard models of Winner, and Tervoort was invited to visit and judge them. If islanders had developed a coy affection for the oil rig, they had become openly adoring of the salvage master, and Tervoort rapidly advanced to local celebrity status. She was invited to take part in the island\u2019s fun-run. She gave a hit lecture at a local university, about a salvor\u2019s life.</p> <p>It was Tervoort\u2019s opinion that Winner would never survive being towed any serious distance, certainly not to the Mediterranean as planned, and so efforts were directed to get the rig on to the back of the heavy-lifting ship, Hawk. In a complicated process that would involve Hawk sinking herself into the water, drifting beneath the rig and then rising again, Winner would have to be lifted up and carried out of Scotland. They call this dry-towing. It happened in early October, after several false starts. Conditions had to be just right for Hawk to submerge and re-emerge, and islanders had several times gathered at vantage points to wave the rig away, only for the departure to be called off because of bad weather.</p> <p>In the end, on 6 October, Winner left Lewis unobserved, stealing away in the dark, her departure as abrupt and even as dashing as her arrival. \u201cI miss her,\u201d said Laura Carse, the Dalmore surfer.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Malta</h2> <p>Strapped to Hawk, Winner moved south. She passed the outstretched fingers of mainland Scotland and patiently negotiated the busy shipping lanes of the Irish Sea. On 9 October the crafts passed the mouth of the Channel and then picked up speed, ripping through the Bay of Biscay in the better part of a day.</p> <p>After a fortnight at sea, both vessels had passed by Spain and Portugal and were in horn-hailing distance of Africa. They sailed between Tangier and Gibraltar and into the Alboran Sea, then pressed on past Sardinia and into the Mediterranean. Standing tall on the deck of her carrier ship, Winner looked as cool and improbable as a heron crossing water on the back of a paddling hippo. Hawk and Winner made Maltese waters on 25 October, dropping anchor off the capital, Valletta. High in the water as she was, Winner was easily visible over the square, stone rooftops of this ancient city, and she drew many Maltese to the seafront. A sightseers\u2019 boat, known as a <em>luzzu</em>, freighted with tourists, was piloted closer for a look.</p> <p>At anchor in Malta, repair work was carried out on the rig\u2019s damaged pontoons, while her owners exchanged export permissions with various authorities. Otherwise, Winner basked. It was bright and hot in the Mediterranean, and this old rig, once so profoundly chilled by North Sea winters that her steel would be painful to touch, at last warmed through. The Times of Malta sent a photographer to snap a northern celebrity come south to sunbathe. Carmel Pule, a retired professor of engineering, and also a keen sailor and ship-spotter, trained binoculars on Winner from the roof of his home. The 77-year-old had seen countless vessels come and go, Malta being a popular stopping point for shipping enterprise of every sort, and brisk handling of maritime paperwork a key part of the island economy. Pule could not recall seeing an oil rig come in piggy-back before. He got on his motorbike and rode to the coast. \u201cNot beautiful to look at as individual craft,\u201d he told his wife that evening, describing the trussed-together Winner and Hawk. But an appealing couple, \u201ctogether for the sake of convenience, or a temporary love affair\u201d.</p> <p>Pule did it, I did it \u2013 we do this, as humans, we humanise seacraft. Vessels are christened under bottles of fizz. They\u2019re given nicknames and ascribed character. Months after disembarking Winner for the last time, her crew could describe for me with precision, as if they were established personality traits, the rig\u2019s distinctive pitch and roll, the chatter of her anchor chains in wind, the subtle but thrilling smell of helicopter fuel that came through the ventilation system to let them know a batch of letters and newspapers had arrived.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Malta, Pule kept a vigil on Winner from his roof, and sent me long emails in which he ruminated on the rig\u2019s visible old age, on her retirement, on an end to the obvious usefulness of things; he did not always register a distinction between the vessel\u2019s state and his own. Seacraft engender affinity, and perhaps only those who are obliged to take a wider perspective can remain entirely unromantic about them. The master salvor Sylvia Tervoort, who tended to meet vessels when something had gone dreadfully wrong with them, considered my question about whether she felt any affection towards the craft she had worked on and said: \u201cMaybe if this was a movie.\u201d When I spoke with Patrizia Heidegger of Shipbreaking Platform, she stressed that her organisation was concerned with the humanitarian and environmental burden of shipbreaking. As such, she was politely unenthusiastic about too much sentiment being spent on the boats.</p> <p>On 24 October, a day before Winner\u2019s arrival in Malta, Transocean had put out a statement to investors, confirming her sale as scrap. The company added that the rig would now be dismantled; \u201crecycled\u201d was their word. In describing a great, curling route out of Scandinavia, west and then south and then east (east, east) to the Med, Winner had passed 18 EU-approved facilities for shipbreaking, including those in Fosen in Norway, Grenaa in Denmark, Lowestoft in England, Bordeaux in France, Ghent in Belgium and Vinaroz in Spain. Unwanted sea junk does not often find its way to Europe, or stay long there. Had Winner been a fixed-drill platform, built into northern bedrock, exacting regulations and conventions would have insisted that this structure be dismantled and recycled in place. When an oil rig has an engine and a propeller, however \u2013 when she is classed as a vessel; a mobile <em>she</em>, not a stationary <em>it</em> \u2013 regulations can be outdistanced. Berths can be sought where conventions are not quite so stringent.</p> <p>And to sail a condemned vessel east from Europe is to adjust the financials of a demolition substantially. A secondhand vessel is currently worth about $190 per tonne to a shipbreaking yard in Turkey, a price established by the local market in reclaimed steel. Sail on to China and a different market, and the same metal is worth $210 per tonne. At breakers\u2019 yards in Alang in India, Chittagong in Bangladesh and Gadani in Pakistan, they will pay around $280 per tonne. Meanwhile, at the EU-approved shipbreaking sites, which are bound to conform to continental waste laws, and where vessels are dismantled in closed-off quays or dry docks, rates are less competitive: European yards offer zero dollars per tonne, and, in fact, tend to ask a fee to take a shipowners\u2019 junk. Of the 864 vessels that were dismantled around the world last year, nine were dismantled in Europe. Give or take a dozen (sent to Mexico, the Philippines, Russia and South Korea), the remainder went to breaking yards in Turkey, China, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.</p> <p>The NGO Shipbreaking Platform has for some years tracked the movements of surplus ships to these sites, finding it necessary, over time, to start documenting human as well as vessel expiry. They add to their records the blunt, dire summaries of a tragedy every time a shipbreaker is killed in an accident anywhere in the world. Chaudhry Baliram Indrajit, crushed by a crane in Alang in January 2016. Muhammad Asif, killed by fire in Gadani in March 2016. Shibbir Ahmed and Jalal Uddin, both of whom fell to their deaths in Chittagong in July 2016. There are dozens of such deaths every year, the majority of them in yards in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, where men and boys pick apart vessels without appropriate tools or safety equipment, assuming terrific risks. As Winner underwent repairs in Malta, that October, the tally of acknowledged deaths in 2016 stood at 30, all in yards in south Asia.</p> <p>Of those 864 vessels sent for demolition that year, 668 went to yards in that region. \u201cThe incentive is to go to south Asia,\u201d said Patrizia Heidegger of Shipbreaking Platform, \u201cbecause the highest price paid per tonne is there.\u201d Whether individual shipowners took up that incentive depended, in her view, on a moral-financial reckoning. How much they cared about profits, as against how much they cared. \u201cThe reason you have owners going to beaches in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is money,\u201d said Petter Heier, head of Grieg Green, a subsidiary of the Norwegian maritime group Grieg established to promote and advise on responsible shipbreaking. Since 2010, Heier has sought to persuade divesting owners to send their excess to one of a group of vetted breaking yards in Turkey and China, rather than the higher-paying, less-audited yards in south Asia. Heier continued: \u201cThere are major accidents in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh every week. No company wants to be associated with that. So they sell through middlemen. They change the name of their vessels. They try to hide their [radar] tracking.\u201d</p> <p>These evasions infuriate the watchdog groups in their efforts to hold a shadowy industry to account, but do not always scuttle them. For instance, Shipbreaking Platform had laboriously tracked through its final movements a German-owned cargo ship called HS Colon, which happened to arrive in Malta at the same time as Winner. While at anchor in the Mediterranean, HS Colon disappeared. When the NGO caught up with her, she had undergone a brisk identity change, shedding the initials that linked her to her former owners, Hansa Treuhand, and was heading for Alang under the name of Colo. That month, a tanker called Gaz Fountain was bought for scrap by a yard in Gadani. Before she sailed, Gaz Fountain became Rain. On 9 January this year, Rain caught fire during demolition on a Pakistani beach, killing five workers. A few weeks earlier, in November, another ship had exploded at Gadani, killing at least 27 workers.</p> <p>Still astride Hawk, Winner left Maltese waters on 27 October. She moved east towards Crete and wove between a scattering of Aegean islands. She was bound for Turkey, and a place on its west coast called Aliaga, where the Turkish shipbreaking industry is based.</p> <p>This was an expensive choice of destination by Transocean. Around $80 or $90 per tonne in value had been foregone, more than $1m in total, compared with what might have been wrangled for Winner from a yard in south Asia. Petter Heier at Grieg Green said he believed that \u2013 slowly, gradually \u2013 owners such as Transocean were coming to acknowledge the longer-term, intangible gains of careful disposal, even if this meant shorter-term, tangible loss. \u201cInsurance companies are putting pressure on shipowners to recycle responsibly. Their employees are putting pressure. Society is putting pressure.\u201d In the case of Transocean, Heier offered an opinion (\u201ca personal opinion\u201d) that the company was further influenced in its thinking by its involvement in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\">Deepwater Horizon</a> catastrophe. When it exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Deepwater Horizon was contracted, notoriously, to BP. But it was Transocean\u2019s rig.</p> <p>\u201cI would guess Deepwater Horizon triggered something,\u201d Heier said. \u201cThey are very careful [now], that if something happens with them on the beach in India, Bangladesh or Pakistan, that might ruin their name in the market.\u201d When I expressed surprise that Winner should have departed Malta still a Winner, without a change of identity in the manner of Colon or Gaz Fountain, Heier said: \u201cThey didn\u2019t change the name because they didn\u2019t need to hide anything. They chose a good yard.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"049e77b32446c776123adc5331e9ad74455193a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/049e77b32446c776123adc5331e9ad74455193a1/0_12_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Transocean Winner arrives in Aliaga, Turkey to be dismantled\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transocean Winner oil rig arrives in Aliaga, Turkey to be dismantled.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deniz Haber Ajansi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Aliaga</h2> <p>They lit up the shore with flares on the day the rig came in at Aliaga. This was to acknowledge the end of a three-week journey that had ended up taking three months, and to show a pack of tugboats \u2013 now that Winner was off the submerged Hawk and being pulled and pushed towards the beach \u2013 just where to put her. The float-off took place at lunchtime on 5 November. Winner had a token crew again: representatives from Transocean and SMIT back aboard for the final tow. Guiding flares on the shore, at least from Winner\u2019s deck, appeared only as spots of fire among hundreds. Aliaga beach was aflame \u2013 in the shallows, where carcasses of ships and rigs were disassembled by spark-showering blowtorches, and in the narrow yards beyond, where amputated pieces were further torched. Dense smoke filled the air above the yards.</p> <p>From the water, it must have appeared to the uninitiated that Aliaga had been freshly, plentifully bombed; perhaps doused and jumbled by tidal waves, too. In fact, this was a normal working day on the beach. At its western edge, a Del Monte fruit boat had been perfectly halved. To the east was a cargo carrier, Modern Express, that had some months earlier been abandoned by her crew while stricken and drifting in the Bay of Biscay. Nearby were two demobbed frigates, recently owned by the Spanish navy. Winner was put in next to the halved Del Monte boat, on a part of the beach owned by a local shipbreaking company called Isiksan.</p> <p>Isiksan\u2019s foreman, a muscular 30-year-old Istanbulite named H\u00fcsseyin Essen, sailed out to meet the rig. Essen had been the foreman here when Isiksan accepted its first oil rig for demolition, in early 2015. Ocean Concord had shown up 200 metres from the shore, and when Essen and his colleagues sailed out to meet her, they had no idea what to do next. Ever since they started shipbreaking in Aliaga in the 1970s, vessels had been brought ashore using a method known as \u201cbeaching\u201d; that is, they were piloted inland and made to mount the beach at speed. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYltdonj2iE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Trembling phone footage from 2013</a> of a ferry being beached in an explosion of smoke and water has been viewed more than 3m times on YouTube.) With the sterns half-ashore, breakers could then cut in and dismantle the ships laterally, as a snacker might eat through a baguette. But oil rigs were not fast enough or strong enough for beaching. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what the hell we were going to do,\u201d Essen said. There was an idea to work on Concord at sea. In the end, heavy chains were tied around her legs and connected via winches to powerful vehicles on the shore. Concord was hauled through the shallows like a struggling fish. Through many oil rig landings since, this method had proved fine. Winner, towed and carried and storm-propelled on this fantastically harried trip east, would be dragged the last metres by straining bulldozers.</p> <p>Unlike the colossal breakers\u2019 beaches of south Asia, or the disparate yards scattered around coastal China, Turkish shipbreaking is packed close in one place, concentrated entirely on this government-allotted mile of coast on the outskirts of Aliaga. The beach here has been divided into as many slim, neighbouring yards as will fit \u2013 25 of them. Considering its comparative scale, Aliaga should be a minor consumer of the world\u2019s excess sea-tonnage. But since Ocean Concord arrived 18 months ago, it has established itself, improbably, as the world\u2019s foremost consumer of oil rigs. Something like 300,000 tonnes of unwanted rig had been brought here \u2013 Hunter and Yatzy and JW McLean and John Shaw and Southern Cross and Aleutian Key and Amirante and Scarabeo 4 and Arctic I and Arctic III \u2013 as well as that pair of young Enscos, the two rigs that were barely a decade old when they were sent by their owners for disposal. The Isiksan yard, its opening on to the Aegean no wider than an average-sized rig, had undertaken most of the demolitions. Petter Heier of Grieg Green, which advised Transocean on these latter stages of the disposal, said Isiksan had been chosen because of this expertise.</p> <p>It was expertise hard-won. Essen and his colleagues learned over the months that the best way to scrap a rig was to deposit a group of blowtorchers on the upper deck (carrying them there in a crane-hoisted cage) and then to let them burn their way downwards. The process took months, but because more men could get at more vessel on a rig than on a beached ship, and because rigs tended to have cranes that could be co-opted into the effort of self-destruction, Essen\u2019s scrappers were getting faster and faster at their work. With Winner, they targeted the helipad first, weakening it with blowtorches before a crane came in to pick it clean away. Winner\u2019s galley went next, then half her accommodation block. A fortnight into the demolition, the horizontal decks were still in place, but the walls between had been so gnawed at that Winner looked liked one of the cut-away diagrams sketched by Hader Liden at his drawing board decades earlier.</p> <p>The rig\u2019s sale to Isiksan was formalised and finalised the moment she came off the back of Hawk. In the words of Isiksan\u2019s young chief, a 26-year-old Aliagan named Soner Sari, Winner was a \u201ccooked meal\u201d, in that she had been brought to the yard whole and the workers there only had to digest her. They did this by cutting 50-tonne pieces off her, lifting these pieces into the yard, where the steel could be separated from everything else, then trucking off this valuable metal in one-metre-squared pieces that would be sold to a foundry nearby. Not all vessels in Aliaga were \u201ccooked meals\u201d. Other deals struck by Sari specified that Isiksan must fetch unwanted craft from wherever they had outlasted their use. These agreements, known in the industry as \u201ccash-buyer\u201d deals, could be profitable \u2013 but they were also risky. Early in 2016, an old ship called Bannock had been cash-bought by Sari from her owners in Italy. Sailed into the Matapan Sea, bound for Aliaga, Bannock had quickly listed and capsized, ceasing to exist in the old-fashioned way, by sinking to the bottom. \u201cThat was a shitty feeling,\u201d Sari said.</p> <p>We were sitting in his office on the yard, watching the slow destruction of Winner through a picture window. Boyish, dark, smartly dressed, Sari sometimes threw out his hands when he spoke, showing a bracelet on each wrist, one of them decorated with pictures of turtles. He had a Range Rover parked outside, in which we had driven together from central Aliaga, passing various chemical factories, oil refineries and foundries. Closer to the breakers\u2019 beach, an informal flea market of maritime bric-a-brac had been established, where traders sold recovered items from the dismantled ships. Sari continued: \u201cWhen we buy in a faraway port it\u2019s cheaper, because we\u2019re taking certain risks, and if it works out, we\u2019ll we make money for taking those risks.\u201d On his phone he had photographs of Bannock sinking. \u201cAt that point, your company\u2019s $20m \u2013 or whatever you\u2019ve paid \u2013 is gone. Poof. It hurts.\u201d</p> <p>Sari did not want to say exactly how much Isiksan had paid Transocean for the right to scrap Winner. Estimating based on local market rates, it could have been as much as $3.5m, though Sari only allowed that it was a seven-figure sum, and that Isiksan expected to turn a profit on the recovered steel. Parts other than a rig\u2019s steel could also be valuable to a breaking firm \u2013 for instance, any deck cranes that were in resellable condition. The lifeboats that came stitched to vessels could also be sold on to the bric-a-brac guys beyond the yard. Hundreds waited to be sold there, bordering the road like giant orange crash barriers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/13/the-death-and-life-of-a-great-british-pub\">The death and life of the great British pub | Tom Lamont</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through Sari\u2019s office window, we looked at a newly removed piece of Winner\u2019s accommodation block, which had just been brought up into the yard. It might once have been a section of corridor, and electric cabling and insulation foam still clung to its steel walls. A hydraulic excavator started tossing and rolling it in the dirt \u2013 cartwheeling it over and over to shake away the wire and the foam. By the end of the day, Sari judged, that steel would be on a foundry floor. About $3,000 worth, he said, pricing it by eye.</p> <p>While we drank strong, tarry coffee, we discussed the environmental consequences of shipbreaking. It was no coincidence, Sari said, that Aliaga\u2019s yards were huddled up beside refineries and foundries. Heavy industry had been moved to Aliaga en masse in the 1970s, \u201cbecause the government wanted to wrap it up in one area, keep everything <em>else</em> nice\u201d. Sari acknowledged that the local yards had not always upheld the strictest standards when it came to minimising environmental damage, but he was working to change that. Beneath the Isiskan yard he had installed a drainage system to catch and pump off pollutants. Down in the water there were brightly coloured booms, bobbing in a circle around Winner\u2019s legs, there in theory to stop any floating waste from getting out into the Aegean. A confidential 2015 report by the shipping consultancy Litehauz, obtained by journalists from the <a href=\"https://www.danwatch.dk/en/undersogelse/maersk-and-the-hazardous-waste/\">investigative agency Danwatch</a> last year, detailed the potential impact of ships that were torch-cut on tidal water. The report estimated that for every 10,000 tonnes of vessel torched, about 120 tonnes of molten steel and two tonnes of chipped-away paint escaped into the sea. Sari insisted that the water off Isiksan\u2019s yard was regularly tested for pollutants. When I asked if he would swim out there, he thought for a moment and answered: \u201cWhy not?\u201d Petter Heier of Grieg Green said his company had audited the Isiksan yard and found its environmental procedures acceptable. Look, Sari said, it might be distasteful, but somebody had to get rid of shipowners\u2019 garbage. He gestured at the yard through the window. In his view, it was better that it happened out there than on the deadly beaches of Alang or Chittagong. He had applied for European recognition for the Isiksan yard, hoping to see it added to a list of EU-approved shipbreaking sites.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"cbd05d56a2048f52e50a3fd74555f34ccd37377a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbd05d56a2048f52e50a3fd74555f34ccd37377a/0_0_3500_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ship-breaking yards in the Turkish port city of Aliaga.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ship-breaking yards in the Turkish port city of Aliaga.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Osman Orsal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The shipbreaking yard</h2> <p>We took a walk together through the yard, where the immediate noise was at first so much to contend with \u2013 the guttural, football-crowd \u201cOoooh!\u201d of ignited blowtorches, the grating complaint of metal on metal, bulldozer rumbles, generator whines \u2013 that I put off the matter of sights until a second lap. In the reddish-brown dust, fine as powder in places, a combination of soil and dirt and tiny coloured chips of paint, I found a Norwegian chocolate bar called a Stratos, still in its packaging. Nearby was a plastic shoehorn, apparently flung from the cartwheeling corridor, and a takeaway menu from a Chinese restaurant in Lewis. The discoveries increased in size \u2013 a gas mask, a boot, a barrel on fire, a pile of fire extinguishers, a larger mountain of green and white foam \u2013 until we were standing beside great, upright sections of mud pipe, tall enough for a person to walk through, cut into giant, swiss-roll slices and now being lifted into the bed of a truck.</p> <p>Early in Winner\u2019s demolition, a big, square piece of her decking, like the mat of a boxing ring, had been retained because it was flat and smooth and would skim briskly through the dusty yard when dragged behind a bulldozer. It now served as a carrying palette for the rig\u2019s disparate amputations, and brought sliding up from the shore an entire utility closet, placed upside down. An equipment rack on the closet\u2019s outer wall was slung with vices, chains and thick bolts the size of milk bottles. A sign above the inverted door warned that it might close violently at sea. When I tried to step inside, Sari said: \u201cUh, don\u2019t go in there yet.\u201d He indicated that parts of the room were so freshly torched that they were still smouldering.</p> <p>Airhorns sounded: lunch. I walked among yellow-helmeted breakers \u2013 about 70 of them were rostered to work today \u2013 as they streamed off Winner. The men I met lived locally. They said they earned wages of about $1,300 a month. According to investigations by Asli Odman, a member of Labour Watch Turkey, there had been at least 10 fatal accidents in the various yards of Aliaga since 2010. On the oil-refining ship Kuito, being dismantled at a neighbouring yard in 2015, a worker fell into the hold and died. On the cruise ship Pacific, dismantled by Izmir Ship Recycling Co in 2013, two workers were poisoned by carbon monoxide. I asked a 31-year-old Isiksan employee named Zafer Erdem, who operated a crane, whether he felt any fear whenever the next new rig arrived for demolition. No, said Erdem, when a rig came in he thought: work, two or three months of it. Erdem and his colleague Kamil Conge, a 45-year-old field manager, had a combined 30 years of experience on the beach. An inch beneath the dirt, Conge said, there was a layer of concrete that extended most of the way to the shore \u2013 a recent addition, before which the yard became a muddy horror whenever it rained. In those days, Conge said, a ship \u201ccould take a year to dismantle\u201d. I was told there had been injuries to workers in the Isiksan yard; accidental scorchings was the example given. Everyone remembered the recent death on Kuito, along the beach. Work stopped for a day in a show of respect.</p> <p>Not far from the mess hall, in the mud, I came across something colourful \u2013 a Norwegian consumer magazine, six years out of date and splayed open at an article about red wines. A 26-year-old yard worker called Omer Dogan, about to skip lunch and go to prayers at a nearby mosque, said they had sometimes found \u201cfunnier stuff\u201d on incoming oil rigs. Omer reddened, not wanting to say pornography. H\u00fcsseyin Essen told me he had many times come across collections of family photographs. Sari was once inspecting a brought-in trawler when he found a full outfit of ski gear in a cupboard. The Spanish frigates had come to Aliaga, he said, stripped of computers, but still with several missile launchers intact. Sari liked it best when they found a certain type of brass valve on ships. Isiksan owned a small foundry that processed non-ferrous metals, mostly salvaged bronze, which would be melted down and fashioned into storm valves, for resale to the shipbuilding industry. Sometimes, Isiksan\u2019s valves found their way back to Isiksan, got removed and were melted down again. I mentioned to Sari that I had met a man on the Isle of Lewis, an eccentric local professor called Arne V\u00f6gler, who had led a volunteer mission to scour the waters of Dalmore Bay after Winner had gone. V\u00f6gler, searching for debris that might harm the environment, had ended up fishing out Winner\u2019s enormous propeller. He joked to me about installing it as garden furniture. Hearing this, Sari raised an eyebrow. \u201cI wondered where that propeller had gone,\u201d he said, and sniffed. \u201cBrass alloy. Tell the guy he owes me $50,000.\u201d</p> <p>At the water\u2019s edge, the big steel carrying palette waited in the dirt. Sari stood on one of its upturned corners, hands in his pockets, bouncing on the flexible metal. The Aegean lapped at Winner\u2019s ruptured pontoons. From here I could see the intricate patterning of rust up the oil rig\u2019s legs \u2013 grades of peach, grey, green, black and bleach-white stains, recording, as if they were a sailor\u2019s tattoos, Winner\u2019s many tours in the North Sea. I knew from studying Hadar Liden\u2019s sketches that the thick legs were actually hollow, with ladders inside them to provide a route between the decks and the pontoons in case of emergency. In Aliaga, a doorway had been torched in one of these forward legs, and square windows cut at intervals up to the deck, so that when his workers climbed, Sari said, they didn\u2019t have to do so in the dark.</p> <p>I suggested that I try climbing up the inside of Winner myself. \u201cNo,\u201d said Sari. By this point I was accustomed to being refused requests to get aboard the rig. \u201cNo,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019ve tried going up by the ladder and it\u2019s like scaling a 10-storey building. Better take the cage.\u201d</p> <p>He signalled to an operator in a nearby crane, who answered by rotating and depositing on the shore a carry-cage about the size of a couple of telephone boxes, painted blood-red. I stepped inside and held on to the cage\u2019s central pole, like a commuter on a bus, as it was hoisted fast into the air, spinning through several terrible rotations before settling into a queasy, side-to-side sway. Before landing the cage on the rig, the crane swung me high and wide above the beach, so that for the first time I could see the full, fiery chaos of Aliaga. The fruit boats and frigates and oil rigs were not going quietly, but inchingly, they <em>were</em> going; and soon their berths on the shore would be filled by the next redundant or repented-of thing.</p> <p>Back in his office, I had asked Sari what would happen when the world\u2019s fleet had been adequately thinned, when there were no more superfluous rigs for him to buy and dismantle. He said he expected this to happen soon. \u201cNext year? The year after?\u201d As rigs disappeared, rates to hire the remaining ones would rise and, eventually, an incautious oil industry would find an economic (if not glowingly ethical) equilibrium. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll go looking for the next thing.\u201d Sari had in mind a smaller type of oil platform known as a jack-up, of which there were many hundreds filling the seas. \u201cCold-stacked all over, no jobs, no <em>prospects</em> of jobs \u2026\u201d</p> <p>I asked him if it ever seemed a pity to break up such monumental and characterful structures. Did he look at Winner in the way that I had come to look at her, in the way her former crew looked at her, as something dignified? Sari said the only emotion he could feel about Winner was relief, when she was gone, on schedule. But not long ago, he acknowledged, he had had a wobble. It was over those two young Ensco rigs \u2013 Ensco 6003 and 6004 \u2013 that had come out of Brazilian waters. When Sari won the right to scrap them, he took the unusual decision to sail the rigs under their own power from South America to Turkey. \u201cI piloted one myself, for the last mile to Aliaga. I wanted to try it out.\u201d Sari mimed adjusting thrusters, striking buttons. \u201cEverything was like new, all the controls.\u201d They demolished Ensco 6003 and 6004 over the course of about 10 weeks. \u201cBeautiful machines. Beautiful machines,\u201d Sari said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>On the Transocean Winner</h2> <p>The cage was lowered on to Winner\u2019s deck, where it smelled of propane and singed steel, of grease and hydraulic fuel. Disorientatingly, here, the rig\u2019s insides were outside, so that a payphone that had once stood in the accommodation block was now upright and exposed in the open air. Two ping-pong balls, mysterious survivors of the long voyage, juddered on the payphone\u2019s coin shelf. Nearby, blowtorchers cut their way out from inside a cabin, and above them a deputation of breakers directed liquid from a hose into a vat marked \u201cChemical Spill\u201d. Thinking of the geologist Brit Fredheim, and her evening constitutionals around the rig, I set off to walk Winner\u2019s circumference.</p> <p>All along the perimeter fence were signs that ordered \u201cRespect this barrier\u201d, signs that continued until the barrier fell away completely, mangled, torn and disrespected by the storm back in the Hebrides. I moved towards the interior, passing pools of standing water on the corrugated floor, and crater-bursts of rust where it was dry. Someone had left a dozen eggs on the floor by a ladder. There were stacks of dusty computer towers in a cupboard, and orange lifejackets that filled two bath-sized tubs to the brim. In a windowless office, where there were two leather-effect chairs and a tacked-up poster of a motorbike, I found a whiteboard on which somebody had written \u201cCrew 6 says goodbye\u201d. Below, on a shelf, there was a leather-bound logbook, neatly filled with the signatures of men and women who had seen through a particular watch on Winner. There were pages and pages of names, going back to the early 1990s. I considered stealing the book, or adding my own signature. In the end, I put it back on the shelf, to be destroyed with the rest. Outside, I passed Zafer Erdem in his crane, merrily terrorising a piece of racking at the base of the derrick. We waved.</p> <p>By the end of November, Winner had been stripped of everything above the midriff, bar her derrick. This was pulled down on 3 December, then chained to bulldozers, which laboured until the tower toppled forward; instead of landing on an outstretched jetty that was meant to catch the pieces, it twisted and crashed pinnacle-first into the shallows. Once the pieces had been fished out, work resumed to reduce the rig\u2019s legs. By mid-December, Winner amounted to little more than a pair of pontoons under blackened stumps, the dwindling structure kept stable by thin strips of horizontal decking, so that it resembled a pair of ice skates strung together by the laces. By Christmas Day, only the pontoons were left. These were dragged out of the water and into the dirt so that another unwanted rig, Transocean Driller, could be parked on the slipway behind. Winner\u2019s port-side pontoon was sliced up and trucked away in the first days of January. Very likely, by this point, there were swirls of the rig\u2019s old steel in the refashioned blocks and beams that were leaving the local foundries, to be sold on for use in construction projects around the Turkish interior.</p> <p>On 5 January, something curious happened on Aliaga beach. Winner\u2019s final piece, her starboard pontoon, was half gone. Snow began to fall, rare in this part of Turkey, carrying on for four days and keeping the breakers from their work. A reprieve \u2013 days in which Winner was left out and unmolested, in weather she knew well. By the following week, the snow had gone and the cutting resumed. The last of the pontoon was lifted on to a truck on 13 January, and smelted that afternoon.</p> <p><em>Photographs by Andrew Milligan/PA; Heather Skull; Deniz Haber Ajansi; Osman Orsal/Reuters</em></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2017.
