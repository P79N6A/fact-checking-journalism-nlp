      "bodyText": "Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke pledged to keep injecting money into the US economy until it recovers Thursday as it announced a rolling program to buy $40bn a month in mortgage-backed securities. The widely anticipated third round of quantitative easing \u2013 dubbed QE3 \u2013 comes after Fed chairman Ben Bernanke had said he was increasingly concerned about the recovery. Bernanke said the plan was aimed at reviving the jobs market by stimulating the still troubled housing market. \"This is a Main Street policy because what we're about here are jobs,\" he said at a press conference. He said the Fed stood ready to take more action if the situation deteriorated further and that the he would not \"rush to tighten policy\" even when signs of a stronger recovery emerge. Wall Street cheered the move, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring over 200 points. Gus Faucher, senior economist with PNC Bank, said the open-ended nature of the mortgage bond buying scheme \u2013 a marked break from previous QE efforts \u2013 sent a clear signal that the Fed was committed to propping up the US recovery. \"It was much more aggressive than we were expecting,\" he said. \"Bernanke clearly feels that the recovery in the jobs market just isn't there.\" On top of the new scheme, the Fed said it would continue its action to bring down long-term interest rates, dubbed \"Operation Twist\", through the end of this year. Together the schemes will pump $85bn a month into the US economy. Bernanke said there were signs of recovery in the housing market and in the wider economy, but the Fed feels the economy is not yet strong enough to go it alone. His move so close to the election is likely to draw fire from Republican critics, though a response to the announcement from presidential candidate Mitt Romney was notable by its absence. The open-ended nature of QE3 will infuriate those who already argue Bernanke is too interventionist. But Faucher said that if the latest stimulus program had been given an expiration date, investors would once again have been asking what comes next. \"He's done this twice already. This is a way of saying we are sticking with it,\" he said. The Fed chairman refused to be drawn on precisely what signs would have to emerge before he turns off the spigot. \"We are looking for ongoing, sustained improvement in the labor market. There isn't a specific number in mind but what we've seen in the last six months isn't it,\" he said. The statement came after clear signals from Bernanke that he was preparing to act. The economy was \"far from satisfactory\" and the continuing high rate of unemployment threatened to \"wreak structural damage,\" Bernanke said in a speech at the high-powered annual economic summit of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City last month. Since that speech, the economic situation appears to have deteriorated. In August, the US added just 61,000 new jobs, half what many economists had been expecting. The unemployment rate ticked down from 8.3% to 8.1% but was driven down not by hiring but by 368,000 Americans leaving the labor force. Worrying economic news has continued to emerge since the job's report. On Thursday more evidence of a weakening global economy emerged as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development issued its latest report. The OECD found indications of slower growth in the US, Japan, China, India and Russia among others. The Fed chairman warned that the US still faced \"headwinds\" most notably the so-called fiscal cliff, a year end deadline for the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts and the imposition of massive spending cuts. Unless a political solution is found to the fiscal cliff, the US could be plunged back into recession, according to the Congressional Budget Office. He said the uncertainty over the fiscal cliff had been a major topic of conversation among the Fed's committee members and that uncertainty was a drag on the economy. \"A lot of businesses are waiting to see whether that problem will be resolved and if so how,\" he said. Bernanke's actions are likely to spark a furious backlash from some members of the Republican party, who have criticised his past interventions. The Fed chairman has become a whipping boy for the right, and Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's vice-presidential pick, has clearly stated he is against more stimulus. \"I'm not a fan of more stimulus or more easing,\" Ryan said last month in a CNBC interview. \"The benefits are clearly outweighed by the long-term costs of this. Iit's not working, and all this loose money from the Fed is basically bailing out the fact that President Obama has failed on fiscal policy.\" All but one of the Fed's committee, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, voted for the new stimulus package.",

EADS has lost 10% of its value since the leak of the talks and BAE shares have given back most of Wednesday's 10% gain. What's the problem?

      "bodyText": "A group of workers at a warehouse that supplies Walmart stores have gone on strike to protest what they say are dangerous labour conditions and retaliation by management against employees who complain about them. Organisers for the activist group Warehouse Workers United, which is working in the booming warehouse industry that has grown up in the Inland Empire region of southern California, say at least 20 workers had walked off the job and were protesting outside the gates of a warehouse run by transport firm NFI. Labour abuses in the Inland Empire's warehouse industry have recently been highlighted in various media and academic reports. Experts say the industry, which is thought to employ some 110,000 people, is often staffed by poor, immigrant workers who toil for long hours with little pay and in unsafe conditions. One recent survey by the WWU and the University of California interviewed 101 workers and found that 83 of them said they had suffered a job-related illness. The striking workers at the NFI facility have filed an official complaint with California labour authorities on conditions that they say show inadequate safety protection, not enough access to drinking water in warehouses that can reach 125F on a hot day, and a management culture that bullies them. They also say that workers listed in their legal complaint have since been retaliated against by things such as demotions or reduced hours, and the threat of losing their job. One of the strikers, David Garcia, 29, said he had walked out of work in order to fight for better conditions. \"We were told we would lose our jobs if we did not shut up,\" he said. The workers are not members of a union and risk dismissal by refusing to work. \"I am willing to risk it for the rights of myself and my co-workers,\" said Garcia. The strike comes as WWU begins a six-day \"pilgrimage\" of warehouse workers who will walk 50 miles from the high desert of the Inland Empire to downtown Los Angeles. The march will aim to use the route taken by the shipping containers that arrive by boat in LA and are then driven to the vast warehouse hub of the Inland Empire, where they are unpacked and then reloaded for entry into the distribution networks of major retailers. In its actions the WWU has specifically targeted Walmart warehouses due to the company's scale, which many experts say dictates the practises of the rest of the entire industry. \"We are hoping Walmart will intervene. They must be aware of these problems,\" said Guadalupe Palma, a WWU director. Neither NFI or Walmart responded to requests by the Guardian for comment.

    "webTitle": "Darty investors vote down pay policies as chief executive quits ahead of shareholder revolt", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The \"shareholder spring\" has spilled into the autumn after investors voted down the pay policies of the electrical retailer Darty in a row over the \"golden hello\" handed to chief executive Thierry Falque-Pierrotin three years ago. Investors had been told the share award had performance conditions attached but in fact it did not. As shareholders were on their way to the meeting in central London the company announced that Falque-Pierrotin was stepping down, by \"mutual agreement\", in December once a business review by the new chairman is completed. But some 58% of shareholders still voted against the remuneration report, making it the seventh pay report thrown out by investors this year following Central Rand Gold, Pendragon, Cairn Energy, Centamin, WPP and Aviva. The storm had been brewing ahead of Thursday's annual meeting at the company, which was known as Kesa before the recent sale of its UK business Comet. Darty admitted it mistakenly told investors in 2009 via a stock exchange \"RNS\" announcement that the signing-on award for Falque-Pierrotin of 772,681 shares, worth \u00a3720,000 when he joined, had performance conditions attached. The mistake was repeated in four annual reports, including the one published last month. It was only discovered when Eric Knight, whose activist investment company Knight Vinke owns a quarter of Darty, began scrutinising the chief executive's pay. In an effort to head off a shareholder rebellion, Darty installed former Whitbread boss Alan Parker as its new chairman last month. Parker dismissed the mistakes in the annual reports as a \"clerical error\" when confronted by shareholders. At the annual meeting one private shareholder asked: \"Who committed the error, who found it out and what action are you taking to resolve it? If it was America people would have been prosecuted for that sort of error.\" Parker has sat on the remuneration committee for two years, including most recently as its chair. He said: \"I have some sympathy with our shareholders over this issue. A mistake was made, I admit to it and we've got to move on.\" Falque-Pierrotin, who presided over a 40% fall in the company's share price, is thought to have earned \u20ac6.4m (\u00a35.1m) in cash, pension payments and shares during his tenure. He will be entitled to an estimated \u20ac1.2m under the terms of his contract, which allows for a year's salary and pension payments in lieu of notice. He received no bonus this year or last. Parker's appointment has for now appeased Knight, who had previously threatened to install himself on the board. The activist investor, who voted in person at the annual meeting, said: \"There has been a huge under-performance in the last three years. If the board had acted more quickly we wouldn't be sitting on the losses which we have incurred today. We want to move towards a meritocracy in the sense that there should be no performance pay for no performance.\" Knight called for all employees to become shareholders, for the number of head offices to be cut, and for the company to sell and lease back its real estate and spend some of the profits on a share buyback to boost the stock price. He also wants the Spanish and Italian ventures, which have lost a combined \u20ac350m, to be sold so the group can concentrate on its operations in France, Belgium and Turkey. Parker has promised to find \u20ac20m a year in cost savings, and to carefully consider Knight's suggestions. Announcing the chief executive's departure, he said: \"In the light of the changing shape and focus of the business, the board and Thierry have agreed that on completion of the review, which he is part of, it is the right time to hand over to a new person.\" Falque-Pierrotin said he had enjoyed his tenure at the top.",

      "bodyText": "Next and John Lewis, two of Britain's fastest-growing retailers, have warned of a slowdown on the high street amid fragile \u2013 albeit stable \u2013 consumer confidence. Next, Britain's second largest clothing retailer after Marks &amp; Spencer, admitted August and September had been disappointing and an \"unusually quiet period\". Its shares plunged to close down more than 7%. The chain made a better than expected start to the year, with revenues up 4.8% and profit 10.2% ahead of last year in the first half. M&amp;S chief executive Marc Bolland, meanwhile, said stock management problems that have hit womenswear sales for six months had been fixed. Addressing a Reuters retail summit, he dismissed talk of a takeover bid and said major investors backed his strategy of focusing on the UK. Next's chief executive, Lord Wolfson, questioned whether the disappointing late summer was a one-off due to the Olympics or a sign of wider problems. Analysts estimate that brand sales fell about 3% in the past five weeks because of the Olympics, Paralympics and holidays. \"Is it the general economy slowing down, or is it one-off effects?\" asked Next chief executive Lord Wolfson asked. He suspected the \"last six weeks are not indicative of a significant slowdown in the economy\", but painted a picture of \"subdued stability, with same-store sales moving backwards\" \u2013 though he said new shop space and growth in online sales would make up for that. He noted the gap between inflation and wage increases was narrowing, but thought this would take time to work through. \"If the economy had a weather forecast, the outlook would be overcast \u2013 patchy rain for the foreseeable future. In the run-up to the credit crunch, individuals, businesses and government lived beyond their means. It will take some time to work our way back to affording the lifestyle to which we became accustomed.\" Richard Hunter, head of equities at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Next's outlook statement has proved to be its undoing. Yet the share price reaction masks another set of solid numbers.\" As well as expanding its profitable international online business, Next will introduce same-day, evening, Sunday and next-day-to-store deliveries in Britain over the next six months. It returned a further \u00a3112m to shareholders through share buybacks and increased the interim dividend by 12.7% to 31p a share. John Lewis said like-for-like sales at its stores rose 8.5% in the past six weeks, down slightly from the stellar 9.2% seen in the first half of the year. Its grocery chain, Waitrose, was 4.5% ahead in recent weeks, compared with 2.2% growth in the first half. The partnership made a half-year profit before tax of \u00a3144.5m, up 60% from last year, having gained market share in home, fashion and electricals. \"Consumer demand remains fragile, but has stabilised and we continue to see opportunities to grow market share,\" said John Lewis's chairman, Charlie Mayfield. \"Our rate of growth will remain positive but will be slower in the second half and, with further investment planned in that period to strengthen our business for the longer term, the rapid rate of profit increase is not expected to be carried through to the full year.\" Managing director Andy Street added that he believed the mood of uncertainty had passed, for now. \"Customers think they can see the economy and personal finances panning out. We are not expecting any shock to this.\" John Lewis has, for the first time, trialled a \"pop-up\" shop in Exeter, ahead of the opening of a department store next month. Home Retail Group, the third retailer to report on Thursday, said like-for-like sales at its Argos stores rose 1.4% in the quarter to 1 September, while DIY chain Homebase suffered a 3.7% decline because of wet weather. Philip Dorgan, retail analyst at Panmure Gordon, said: \"We believe that Argos has too many stores, too high a fixed cost base and is close to making losses.\" Home Retail boss Terry Duddy defended Argos's \"strong model\". Having closed seven Argos stores in the quarter, the group plans to shut more over time while upgrading the Argos website. It has also started rolling out Habitat products such as paint and wallpaper in its Homebase stores. Polly Toynbee, page 37",

Until then, the government of Margaret Thatcher had believed it had cracked Britain's long-term economic problems, with several years of strong growth and low inflation in the mid-80s.

By that point Lawson had gone, but his successor \u2013 Major \u2013 decided that the way for Britain to kick its inflation habit for good was to join the ERM, a device by which European currencies had to trade within fixed bands against the mark.

Firstly, at that very moment the economy was plunging into a deep recession triggered by a doubling of interest rates from 7.5% in the summer of 1988 to 15% in the autumn of 1989. Unemployment rose sharply and many of those who had bought homes during the boom found themselves out of work, unable to pay their mortgages and sitting in homes worth a lot less than they had paid for them. Repossessions rose to record levels, as did bankruptcies.</p> <p>The second factor was the reunification of Germany at the end of the cold war, which led to rapid growth and upward pressure on inflation in 1991 and 1992. Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, raised interest rates and this made the mark more attractive to investors, leading to an increase in its value.

Lamont pleaded with the Germans to cut rates. They refused. The British government made large-scale intervention in markets as the pound dropped towards DM2.77. The pound refused to budge.

      "bodyText": "1. Coming off the Gold Standard in 1931 Winston Churchill during his time as chancellor put Britain back on the Gold Standard at its pre-war rate of $4.86 against the dollar with disastrous consequences. The economy was already struggling and returning to the Gold Standard made UK exports uncompetitive. The global downturn following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 deepened the slump and make it impossible for the minority Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald to hold the line, despite unpopular welfare cuts. Leaving the Gold Standard for good helped the economy recover in the 1930s but split the Labour party. 2. The devaluation of 1949 Britain paid a high economic price for victory in the second world war. The country was flat broke and its industrial base, battered by six years of conflict, needed to be converted back into civilian use. The Attlee government negotiated a loan with the Americans, but was forced by Washington to make sterling convertible with the dollar in return. Britain was unable to compete with the much more productive US economy, and this resulted first in the crisis of 1947, followed by the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80 two years later. Labour won a general election in 1950, but only just, and was ousted from power in 1951. 3. The devaluation of 1967 The UK performed less well than its main rivals in the so-called Golden Age of the 1950s and 1960s. Growth was strong and jobs plentiful, but Britain found it hard to compete with the United States, France and Germany. The Labour government of Harold Wilson came to power in 1964 with an ambitious National Plan designed to accelerate Britain's growth rate, but made the blueprint stillborn by refusing to devalue the pound immediately. Instead, Wilson and his chancellor, James Callaghan, imposed austerity measures to keep the pound's exchange rate at $2.80 before giving up the fight in November 1967. Consumers were squeezed so that resources could be diverted to exports, and Wilson \u2013 to his surprise \u2013 lost the 1970 election. 4. The IMF comes to town In the mid-1970s, Britain suffered a number of unpleasant economic shocks. Ted Heath's 1970-74 Conservative government had caused industrial chaos and left office with the country on a three-day week and inflationary pressure rising. Wilson's second spell in Downing Street saw the advent of stagflation \u2013 rising unemployment and inflation that reached a post-war high of more than 25%. Wilson handed over the reins to Callaghan in March 1976 and the scorching summer that followed saw pressure mounting on sterling, even though it was by now a floating currency. Eventually, the UK had to swallow a package of spending cuts to secure a loan from the IMF. Callaghan lost power, narrowly, to Margaret Thatcher in 1979, but the humiliation of the IMF bailout haunted Labour for more than 15 years. 5. Black Wednesday The stain of the IMF was only removed from Labour when the Conservatives suffered a disaster of equal magnitude: the inability of the UK to continue with its membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in the face of wave after wave of speculative selling of the pound. In many of the other crises of the 20th century, the Conservatives were fortunate that they had left office before the full extent of their economic blunders had been exposed. That was true in 1931, 1967 and 1976, when Labour had a rotten inheritance. In 1992, however, the Conservatives' luck ran out. Black Wednesday was followed in 1997 by the biggest electoral defeat suffered by the party in 150 years.",

      "bodyText": "Within minutes of the London markets opening, it was clear the pound was going to come under renewed pressure. There were only three days until the weekend referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty. Unlike the UK, French voters were preparing to decide on plans drawn up by the then president of the European commission, Jacques Delors, for majority voting and closer economic ties. Polls suggested 58% were against. Sterling had joined the EU's longstanding Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1990 but had struggled to remain inside its designated floating band. Now circling City speculators saw a chance to attack Britain's currency and wreck a fledgling monetary union that many of them thought would never work. The Italian lira and Spanish peseta were also under pressure, but it was the pound that was grabbing the headlines. George Soros's Quantum Fund led a field of speculators who borrowed UK gilts only to sell them and buy them back later at cheaper prices. They repeated the trick every few minutes, making a profit each time. Soros said later he had made \u00a31bn from selling sterling he didn't own. By mid-morning the selling was so intense that Bank of England officials were buying \u00a32bn of sterling an hour. The prime minister, John Major, was staying in Admiralty house in Whitehall. He was told about the frenzy of selling and convened a meeting of key ministers. He talked about the possibility of interest rate rises beyond the already sky-high 10% and the need for further interventions by the Bank of England. Senior Conservatives Michael Heseltine, Douglas Hurd and Kenneth Clarke joined Major and the chancellor, Norman Lamont, who was on the end of a phone. At 11am they agreed to push up interest rates to 12%. Jim Trott, former chief dealer for the Bank of England, described the day as \"stunningly expensive\". He said that behind the scenes he bought more sterling in four hours that day than anybody had before or since. All of his purchases lost value during the day \u2013 and went down even more when the government pulled out. The ERM demanded that currencies stayed within a band set in relation to other currencies in the club. To maintain the currency values relative to each other, countries with the most valuable currencies had to sell their own and buy the weakest. In September the deutschmark was the most powerful currency and sterling the weakest within its band. As Trott tells it, the Bank of England was furiously buying sterling but little was done by the Bundesbank to sell deutschmarks. \"The cavalry were the Bundesbank. We kept on looking over the hill, but there was no dust and there were no hats and no sabres. And then later at the conference call they suddenly didn't speak English, which was extraordinary. So we were kind of stretched on that day,\" he said. Thirteen years later, Treasury papers would be released showing the cost to be an estimated \u00a33.3bn. By lunchtime it was obvious the efforts of the central bank and attraction of high UK interest rates were outweighed by a complete lack of confidence in the UK's ability to stabilise its currency. News had filtered through to traders that the head of the German Bundesbank was in favour of Britain devaluing its currency. If this was his view, it explained why he was unwilling to spend money propping up the UK at a higher exchange rate. He obviously believed it was a doomed project and not worth any more German taxpayers' money.

      "body": "<p>Analysts and trade unions have raised concerns over the proposed \u00a329.8bn merger of BAE Systems and EADS, amid concerns that the transaction faces significant regulatory hurdles and will lead to job cuts in the UK if it is successful.</p> <p>Unite, Britain's largest union, said it would seek an urgent meeting with the business secretary, Vince Cable, and the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, in order to secure guarantees over jobs at BAE, Britain's largest manufacturing employer. The combined business will employ 48,000 people in the UK, encompassing a range of manufacturing sites from BAE's shipyards in Govan, Scotland, to the Airbus wing facility in Broughton, north Wales. BAE has cut thousands of jobs in the wake of the government's strategic defence review. It is shedding around 2,000 jobs at its aerospace division and is reviewing its shipbuilding arm, which could result in the loss of more than 1,000 employees at BAE's Portsmouth yard. In May it announced plans to close the historic Armstrong factory in Newcastle upon Tyne as part of a further 620 jobs at its UK business.</p> <p>Ian Waddell, Unite's national officer, said: \"Our first priority will be to safeguard jobs and skills. Any merger will need political approval in Europe and the USA. Questions need to be asked about when the UK government knew about this and what they will do to safeguard jobs.\" He added: \"We will be seeking an urgent meeting with Vince Cable and Philip Hammond and demanding guarantees from the company that a merger will not result in slashing jobs to cut costs. The new company would be the largest manufacturing company in the UK, employing tens of thousands of people in critical defence manufacturing and at Airbus. It is vital that the government ensures these jobs are protected in the UK before approving the merger.\"</p> <p>The Prospect union, which has around 700 members at BAE, said private sector defence contractors had been under \"immense pressure\" due to spending cuts. \"Whether the news of this merger brings reassurance or not for the workers depends on whatever plans for consolidation or growth the merged company will provide. Prospect will be seeking early dialogue with the companies,\" said Mike Clancy, the union's general secretary designate.</p> <p>Sources close to the deal have indicated that the British government has been made fully aware of the implications of the deal with EADS, which is co-controlled by the French and German governments, alongside the Spanish state as a minor shareholder. A government spokesperson said last night that the UK would ensure that the \"public interest\" was protected, but declined to comment on jobs.</p> <p>A source close to the deal played down the concerns. \"It is not about redundancies. Their activities and geographic strengths are largely complimentary. In terms of cost-savings the cuts will be in sourcing and procurement.\" However, the source added that one long-term fear about EADS's UK operations - that the Airbus wing business will move from the UK to Spain - will be eradicated by a successful deal.\" Referring to BAE's proposed 40% shareholding in the combined business, the source said: \"BAE would not take a 40% interest in Airbus only to let those jobs go abroad.\"</p> <p>Lagard\u00e8re, a key shareholder in EADS, said on Thursday it would closely examine any tie-up between the owner of the planemaker Airbus and BAE before accepting any deal. The French media-to-aerospace group, which owns a 7.5% stake in EADS, said: \"The Lagard\u00e8re group intends to ensure that all consequences associated with the proposed EADS NV-BAE Systems plc merger are taken into consideration in determining the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction before it consents to the deal.\"</p> <p>The Lagard\u00e8re holding in EADS is part of a pact designed to maintain the balance between the company's French and German shareholders. The French state also owns 7.5%, while the German carmaker Daimler holds 15%.</p> <p>BAE and EADS have largely complementary businesses, with BAE specialising in defence from the UK nuclear submarine fleet to armoured vehicles for the US army, while EADS is Europe's largest civil aerospace contractor as the owner of Airbus, the Toulouse-based maker of the A380 superjumbo.</p> <p>The regulatory concerns over the deal are twofold: the clearing of any competition hurdles; and receiving clearance from multiple governments that have defence contracts with BAE and EADS. Guy Anderson, a defence analyst at IHS Jane's, said: \"A merger between BAE and EADS is unlikely and wouldn't happen without a lot of trials and tribulations. It would have to navigate onerous regulatory hurdles and sell off many overlapping chunks along the way. If it did go ahead it would create a goliath in terms of scale, putting BAE/EADS ahead of Boeing in revenues, but there is no telling how much of the combined offering would have to be sold off to satisfy regulators.\"</p> <p>However, Anderson said political concerns might be less difficult to overcome, referring to BAE's statement that the UK government would receive a new golden share in the business, which would safeguard its defence interests. \"There is a political dimension. The fact that the UK will keep a stake of sorts in the combined group bodes well and the UK-France defence pact shows that pragmatism can prevail.\" Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners, told the Financial Times that the deal would be a \"tough sell\" to the US government, BAE's biggest customer. He said it would be difficult to persuade them \"that they should allow one of their top five prime contractors [BAE] to be part of a European group when one of their major concerns over the years has been about transfer of intellectual property\".</p> <p>One of the biggest rivals of a combined BAE and EADS, Boeing, was relaxed about the deal on Wednesday night despite the raising of regulatory concerns. Jim McNerney, Boeing's chief executive, said: \"I have a pretty deep and abiding faith in our company's strength, so I don't see this as something that is going to threaten us fundamentally.\" McNerney added that BAE and EADS were pursuing a strategy of balancing commercial and military units that Boeing and others were attempting to achieve as well. \"It does reflect a global consolidation that is beginning to happen,\" he said.</p>",
