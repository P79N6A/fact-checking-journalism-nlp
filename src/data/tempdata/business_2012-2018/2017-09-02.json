      "bodyText": "It\u2019s fair to say the government has been struggling of late. The prime minister has been battling to look in charge with Tony Abbott sniping and undermining at every opportunity. The dual citizenship crisis has the government\u2019s majority looking very shaky; and the marriage equality postal survey looks to be a loser for the government even if it does get passed the high court. On the economics front things have look relatively more favourable for Labor than the government. Under the umbrella of inequality, the Labor party policy approach has clearly led the debate. Issues such as housing affordability, industrial relations and taxation have been largely debated through the frame of the opposition\u2019s choosing. It has also led to some absurd responses from government members letting fly with all manner of accusations about socialism, seemingly unaware that they are neither accurate nor effective. But on Tuesday the treasurer, Scott Morrison, took a somewhat more measured approach in a speech to Bloomberg in Sydney. The economic news out this week might give him hope that things are improving for both the economy and the government\u2019s chances of staying in power. While Morrison still argued the current ALP is \u201cthe most left wing Labor party we have seen in generations\u201d (which is a mantra Labor must hope the Liberals keep up till the next election), he only obliquely went down the \u201csocialism\u201d path, with one mention of \u201cneo-socialism\u201d (whatever the heck that means). He suggested that \u201cpractical, common sense economics\u201d involved pursuing \u201ceconomic growth\u201d and \u201cyou give businesses incentive to expand and innovate; and Australians directly benefit from the tangible opportunity created. This is the economics of opportunity\u201d. The \u201ceconomics of opportunity\u201d (which was the title of his speech) is the conservatives\u2019 way of dealing with inequality because it mostly enables them to do nothing on the issue except keep in place laws that ban discrimination, give tax cuts to businesses and then argue that people just need to take the opportunity to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and get to work. Morrison argued that \u201cthe progressive design of our tax system and our targeted welfare safety net has protected against rising income inequality, particularly since the GFC. That\u2019s a fact.\u201d This fact of course ignores that the government has reduced the progressivity of our tax system, and has continually sought to push people off an already-targeted welfare system. But Morrison was right when he argued that the big driver of people\u2019s frustration towards the government\u2019s economic policies is flat wages growth. Throughout the entirety of the Abbott-Turnbull government, workers\u2019 real wages have not grown. The average worker has less purchasing power now than they did four years ago. If that situation continues up till the next election, the government is plainly going to struggle. But politics can be all about timing, and there are signs that by the next election aspects of the economy might have turned in the government\u2019s favour. This week, the latest private new capital expenditure figures were released showing the strongest quarterly growth of investment for five years. While the mining investment continues its long fall \u2013 albeit at a slower pace \u2013 the non-mining investment side of things is much improved. Non-mining investment in the past year grew by 4.5% \u2013 the best annual growth for two years, and the outlook for the 2017-18 financial year is optimistic. Every three months businesses are asked to predict their investment for the year ahead. This week saw the release of the third estimate for investment during all of 2017-18. On the non-mining side, things were positively chipper. The estimate for non-mining investment in this financial year was 20% above what it was three months ago \u2013 the biggest such increase in nearly 30 years. Should that estimate hold up, we\u2019re looking at around a 10% increase in non-mining investment over what occurred in 2016-17 \u2013 which would be the best growth for three years. And this good news is linked somewhat with Morrison\u2019s argument that the way to fix low wages growth is through corporate profits. He argued in his speech that the reason for low wages growth has been that \u201cuntil the September quarter last year, company profit growth had been declining for three years by an average 0.8% every year\u201d \u2013 and weak profits equals weak wages. And to an extent he is correct. The problem is the relationship is rather more long-term. Profits bounce up and down much more than wages do, but there is a pretty good correlation between three-year company profit growth and annual wages growth. The problem for Morrison is that while there has been a big surge in profits since September last year, it has occurred mostly in the mining sector due to a doubling in the price of coal and a 70% increase in iron ore prices in the last half of 2016. But not only have those prices not been sustained, investment in the industry continues to fall \u2013 and investment is what drives jobs. Thus the big surge in profits which normally flows through to stronger wages growth is coming in sectors where there has actually been a fall in jobs. There are 34,000 fewer people employed in the mining industry than three years ago. And despite a nice increase in the June quarter, wages in the mining industry over the past year grew by just 1.1% \u2013 lower than the national average. For Morrison\u2019s dream of stronger wages via the \u201ceconomics of opportunity\u201d to come true, he needs it to come from the non-mining sector. And thus he would be well pleased with the latest non-mining investment figures. The problem and possible good fortune for Morrison and the government is that investment that leads to jobs, which then leads to improved profits and finally stronger wages all takes time \u2013 at least two years from the current improved position. That might mean just as the next election is held \u2013 should the government go a full-term \u2013 workers will be finally seeing some improvements in their real wages. All the government will then need to do is convince voters that their policies deserve the credit \u2013 and also that they also deserve to be forgiven for the long wait. But Morrison had better hope the improvement comes, because if it doesn\u2019t, voters will be very unlikely to keep giving him the opportunity to talk about economics as treasurer.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hurricane Harvey was such a distraction last week that Donald Trump forgot to tweet about his country\u2019s return to 3% GDP growth. When the news came that US second-quarter GDP, when extrapolated over a year, showed the country growing at the fastest rate in the G7, he was busy flying down to Texas to support the relief effort. Trump and his Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin have promised to deliver 3%-plus growth and here was the first indication that the president\u2019s arrival in the White House had made a difference. In a way, it is just as well he missed the opportunity to brag. The headline figures may look good, but a peek under the bonnet of the US economy makes for disturbing reading. In a report last week a senior City analyst, Albert Edwards, showed that the Trump effect is quite the opposite and much of the life has been sucked out of the American economic juggernaut in the last six months. Edwards\u2019s chosen measure of the economy\u2019s lifeless state is inflation, which has tumbled since the beginning of the year. Not so much the headline inflation figure, but the measure of core inflation that strips out oil prices and other volatile elements. Core inflation is considered a key indicator of an economy\u2019s health. To the ranks of central bankers it reveals how much domestic pressure there is on prices from long-lasting factors such as wages, and not external shocks to prices that can disappear as fast as they emerge. Edwards argues that the slump in inflation knocks out the Federal Reserve\u2019s arguments for a rate rise beyond the current 1% to 1.25% range currently in place. This is an important consideration, when most of the world\u2019s governments and central bankers have braced themselves for another round of interest rate rises from the Fed that could see a flight of cash from their banks to New York. Without a rate rise, weaker nations can relax, safe in the knowledge that the flows of international capital will still come in their direction. Until recently Fed boss Janet Yellen was sticking to her view that there would be at least one more rate rise this year and another couple in 2018. Then she wobbled, as she admitted to Congress that the Fed had missed its 2% inflation target for the last five years and that core inflation stood at 1.4%. Edwards says his preferred measure of core inflation shows it standing at 1.2% and on a downward trajectory. \u201cIf I were a Fed governor,\u201d he said, \u201cI would be pretty shocked/concerned/bemused at inflation developments this year. However confident the Fed is of a self-sustaining-recovery, there is growing evidence of a slide into outright deflation even ahead of the next recession which will likely unambiguously take us deep into deflationary territory.\u201d Edwards is one of many who believe the business cycle in the US, as elsewhere, is running out of steam and will soon go into recession. Japan is only growing, just like the eurozone, with huge amounts of central bank money injected each month. Britain has its outlook clouded by Brexit, but nevertheless, even the modest growth of the last six months would probably be zero or worse without the ultra-low interest rates on offer from the Bank of England. Like many in the City, Edwards believes that the only option is to let the next US recession take its course without heavy Fed intervention, because to continue with ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing is to store more trouble and invite an even bigger crash. But as usual the debate in the City excludes the potential that governments have to support the economy with much-needed day-to-day spending and investment. Trump says that is exactly what he has in mind, but his reckless budget proposals look like being a rerun of the George W Bush tax cuts 15 years ago that favoured the rich and wrecked Bill Clinton\u2019s efforts to balance the books. To step in and allow the Fed to wind down its stimulus efforts, the US Treasury needs to raise more in tax. But not just any tax. One that targets those who are currently hoarding their winnings from the postwar boom. That puts baby boomers firmly in the frame along with their gains from property and pensions. It is a global phenomena that this group have steadfastly refused to pay the tax needed to keep their governments and economies afloat. The Japanese government regularly runs 10% budget deficits and now has a debt-to-GDP level approaching 250% after the middle class switched to loaning its government funds rather than gifting a higher proportion of its income through tax. The Germans hoard cash, which they then expect the rest of the world to borrow and pay interest on to keep them in a bountiful retirement. Britain and the US are among the countries where richer baby boomers vote to offload the problem to younger, lower-income groups, who must now borrow excessively just to make ends meet. Like it or not, low interest rates will be around for a decade or more unless older voters sanction their governments filling the void with taxpayer cash.",

However confident the Fed is of a self-sustaining-recovery, there is growing evidence of a slide into outright deflation even ahead of the next recession which will likely unambiguously take us deep into deflationary territory.\u201d</p> <p>Edwards is one of many who believe the business cycle in the US, as elsewhere, is running out of steam and will soon go into recession. Japan is only growing, just like the eurozone, with huge amounts of central bank money injected each month. Britain has its outlook clouded by Brexit, but nevertheless, even the modest growth of the last six months would probably be zero or worse without the ultra-low interest rates on offer from the Bank of&#xa0;England.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/05/president-tweeted-it-us-economy-really-great-again-donald-trump\">The president tweeted it \u2013 but is the US economy really great again?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like many in the City, Edwards believes that the only option is to let the next US recession take its course without heavy Fed intervention, because to continue with ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing is to store more trouble and invite an even bigger crash.</p> <p>But as usual the debate in the City excludes the potential that governments have to support the economy with much-needed day-to-day spending and investment. Trump says that is exactly what he has in mind, but his reckless budget proposals look like being a rerun of the George W Bush tax cuts 15 years ago that favoured the rich and wrecked Bill Clinton\u2019s efforts to balance the books.</p> <p>To step in and allow the Fed to wind down its stimulus efforts, the US Treasury needs to raise more in tax. But not just any tax. One that targets those who are currently hoarding their winnings from the postwar boom. That puts baby boomers firmly in the frame along with their gains from property and pensions.</p> <p>It is a global phenomena that this group have steadfastly refused to pay the tax needed to keep their governments and economies afloat. The Japanese government regularly runs 10% budget deficits and now has a debt-to-GDP level approaching 250% after the middle class switched to loaning its government funds rather than gifting a higher proportion of its income through tax.</p> <p>The Germans hoard cash, which they then expect the rest of the world to borrow and pay interest on to keep them in a bountiful retirement. Britain and the US are among the countries where richer baby boomers vote to offload the problem to younger, lower-income groups, who must now borrow excessively just to make ends meet. Like it or not, low interest rates will be around for a decade or more unless older voters sanction their governments filling the void with taxpayer&#xa0;cash.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Home Office employee has been suspended after claims of abuse and assaults against detainees at a G4S-run immigration centre. G4S said on Friday that nine members of its staff had been suspended pending an investigation into BBC Panorama allegations of \u201cchaos, incompetence and abuse\u201d at the Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick airport, in West Sussex. Now sources have confirmed that a Home Office worker has also been suspended while allegations relating to his previous employment for G4S at the facility are investigated. A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cWe condemn any actions that put the safety or dignity of immigration removal centre detainees at risk. We are clear that all detainees should be treated with dignity and respect and we expect G4S to carry out a thorough investigation into these allegations and that all appropriate action be taken.\u201d Panorama claims to have undercover footage showing officers \u201cmocking, abusing and even assaulting detainees\u201d at the facility, where drugs are allegedly rife. Brook House is one of two immigration centres run by G4S in the UK and has capacity for 508 adult men. Concerns were raised in the latest inspection, which revealed that some men had been held there for more than two years. The inspectors highlighted issues with the \u201cstark and impersonal\u201d residential units and unsatisfactory sanitary facilities. But overall the report by the chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, in March said it was an \u201cencouraging\u201d inspection. Despite the controversy, G4S is to continue with its bid to renew its contract to run Brook House. Labour MPs have called for the G4S contract to be suspended and reviewed. The company confirmed it would continue with its bid to renew its eight-year-old contract to run the centre from next May. More than 14,000 people passed through the centre in the year to 30 August. It is the latest in a number of scandals to hit the security company, which is also responsible for five prisons in England and Wales. Panorama uncovered alleged abuse and mistreatment of youngsters at a G4S youth detention centre in Kent last year. Medway secure training centre was later judged inadequate by Ofsted inspectors, who found that young inmates were able to watch sexually explicit content on television. Another G4S facility, HMP Birmingham, was hit by riots in December 2016, some of the worst in a UK jail in years. The Panorama episode is due to air on BBC1 at 9pm Monday.",
