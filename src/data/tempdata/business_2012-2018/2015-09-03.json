      "bodyText": "The chilly August that just capped off the coldest British summer in three years meant mixed fortunes for businesses. It was a washout for clothes retailers but sunny times for cut-price airlines. Bookings slumped for campsites in some parts of the country, but crowds flocked to some indoor attractions. The soggy bank holiday in many parts of the country ensured it was the wettest end to the summer in 50 years in Dorset, Hampshire and Guernsey, according to the Met Office. Cornwall and the south coast had to cope with up to three times the average rainfall for August. Chief scientist Prof Julia Slingo said: \u201cNo one can deny that we have had a pretty disappointing summer with a lot of unsettled weather and only a few warm spells, especially through July and August. Our weather has been dominated by low pressure over and to the west of the country that has brought us periods of heavy rain from the south \u2013 what we call the Spanish plume.\u201d The sweltering heat of July, when the mercury rose to 36.7C (98F) at Heathrow, seemed a distant memory. In the end, the average summer temperature was just 13.9C (57F). With the rainclouds hovering, high street stores endured their worst month since the height of the global banking crisis in November 2008 as shoppers spent on holidays abroad instead of clothing or home furnishings. Underlying clothes sales plunged 5.5% in August \u2013 the fourth month in a row that sales fell \u2013 and made the summer the worst in six years, according to a survey of retailers by accountancy firm BDO. \u201cWith the exception of the last week of the month, consumers deserted the high street. The strength of the pound has encouraged Brits to spend more on holidays abroad rather than in the UK,\u201d said Sophie Michael, head of retail at BDO. Cool temperatures and rainy skies were also bad news for food retailers \u2013 which have already been struggling as the supermarkets fought a price war and the cost of food commodities slumped. \u201cThe weather has been particularly poor and hit sales of soft drinks and ice cream, meaning sales are flat in these categories when members should have seen a good seasonal spike,\u201d James Hall, the director of the Bestway convenience store group told trade journal The Grocer. Grocery prices slid 1.7% in the three months to 16 August and with no help from a surge in barbecue parties or picnics total sales rose just 0.9%. One clear beneficiary, however, has been easyJet. The no-frills carrier said on Thursday it expected to make annual profits of up to \u00a3700m, at least \u00a340m more than expected, after a record August. The company flew 7.1 million passengers last month after a surge of late bookings, as Britons headed for M\u00e1laga, Alicante, Faro and Palma de Mallorca. A spokesman for easyJet said rain and colder than average temperatures in August added to the exodus. Beaches and cities across Europe were popular destinations for holidaymakers encouraged by the strength of the pound against the euro. In the UK, the picture varied with the weather across the country. Business at visitor attractions and holiday resorts depended very much on the location. In Scotland, the number of people heading to visitor attractions fell 3.9% in July, according to Visit Scotland, although the number of visits to indoor activities was up. Garden visits were down 5%. Camping and caravan sites in Northern Ireland, Scotland and south-east England saw bookings fall by between 1% and 5%, according to the Camping &amp; Caravanning Club, while drier East Anglia enjoyed a 14.7% rise in the number of pitches sold this summer. But a spokesman for the club said it was hard to say how much the weather had played a part. \u201cOur members live by the motto that there\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, just bad planning, and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t have deterred them in any way,\u201d he said. He may have a point: sales of pitches in south-west England, where the Met Office recorded damp weather, were up 5.9% and Wales also did well with sales up 12.4%. Visit Cornwall said August had been mixed as many visitors booked ahead and were prepared for potentially bad weather. Visitor numbers at the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth were up 50%, as families looked for an alternative to the beach. \u201cWhile rain and cooler temperatures have dominated, we have had some welcome days of glorious sunshine so it certainly hasn\u2019t been all doom and gloom,\u201d said Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwall. One concern for tourist businesses is whether those who made the best of it despite the weather will have vowed that would be the last holiday they spend on the UK\u2019s shores. \u201cIf people have booked and committed to a holiday when the weather isn\u2019t at its best, they will make the most of it, but the worry is how it will affect their destination decisions for future years,\u201d said Bell. Meanwhile, BDO identified a silver lining for retailers. \u201cThe last week of August was cold and wet enough to make people think about autumn,\u201d said Michael. \u201cSo fashion retailers saw an uplift in sales in that final week that this summer\u2019s fragmented discounting has so far failed to deliver.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "European Central Bank's gloom suggests QE2 may be on the horizon", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank (ECB) launched its \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3800bn) quantitative easing programme only in January. Now, with a full year left to complete the bond-buying spree, QE2 is being prepared. The bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, didn\u2019t put it so baldly, of course, but the hints were there in a gloomy press conference that delivered a 1% fall in the value of the euro against the dollar. If the ECB is ready to adapt the \u201csize, composition and duration\u201d of the current programme, everything is up for grabs. Two conclusions follow. First, the old one: the ECB launched QE too late. Even in the face of a deteriorating eurozone economy, it debated the policy for about 18 months before sceptics at the German Bundesbank could be persuaded. The doubters would surely have been won round earlier if they could have anticipated the ECB\u2019s latest (lowered) inflation forecasts: 0.1% this year, 1.1% next, and then 1.7% in 2017. The second is that China has plainly rattled Draghi. \u201cWe are observing a weakening of the prospects of the Chinese economy,\u201d he said, noting that the ECB\u2019s growth forecasts (also lowered) were compiled before the wobble in western stock markets. For short-termists, it is comforting to hear central bankers sounding worried and talking about heavier doses of monetary medicine. Thus stock markets rallied yesterday. But that is just knee-jerk stuff. If the Chinese economy really has hit a brick wall, it will make little difference if the ECB buys, say, \u20ac80bn of bonds a month rather than the current \u20ac60bn. HSBC leaves Midland Bank in the vault Common sense has prevailed at HSBC. The UK branches will not be rebranded as the Midland Bank, an idea that always seemed unlikely to survive a collision with the views of customers. Those under 40 do not remember the Midland name. Those over that age recall an accident-prone organisation that could be relied on to run into most Latin American debt crises. So, after listening to the punters, HSBC will leave \u201cthe listening bank\u201d in the grave. The \u201cnew\u201d name will be HSBC UK, which qualifies as a change only in the imagination of the bank\u2019s top brass. Hold on, you might say, didn\u2019t HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver decree in June that an entirely new name was required? Yes, he did. New ringfencing rules in the UK, requiring retail and investment banking activities to be separated, were deemed such a fundamental reform that customers had to be able to tell the difference between a ringfenced bank and a non-ringfenced specimen. That goal will not be achieved by adding UK to the moniker, but it matters little. Regulators don\u2019t care what HSBC calls its UK retail business as long as it is properly separated to protect taxpayers in the next banking crisis. One suspects this will not be the last time Gulliver marches everybody to the top of the hill, only to march them down again. His other big idea is a possible move of the group\u2019s domicile to Hong Kong/China. As argued here earlier in the week, after Beijing\u2019s alarming and crude attempts to find culprits for its stock market crisis, quitting the UK is another poorly conceived wheeze HSBC should abandon. EasyJet\u2019s late takeoff What is the definition of a perfect summer for easyJet? Pretty much like the one we\u2019ve had. The UK weather was lousy, the pound was strong against the euro, and French air traffic controllers did not strike. Thus a boom in late bookings from the UK to the continent, the airline\u2019s most important market, prompted a reverse profits warning: easyJet will make \u00a3675m to \u00a3700m this year, about \u00a350m more than it had expected only a couple of months ago. Late bookers, as customers know and accept, pay higher prices. The odd part is that easyJet\u2019s golden summer took the City by surprise. None of those helpful factors was a secret and the ticket prices can be found on the website. Shire/Baxalta battle has a sedative effect It is the dullest $30bn (\u00a320bn) bid battle in history. A full month has passed since Shire, the Anglo-Irish drug maker, launched its attempt to bounce Baxalta of the US into an all-share deal to form \u201cthe leading global biotech company focused on rare diseases\u201d. Baxalta rejected the proposal and, despite the odd rumour that Shire would return with improved terms, nothing material has happened. Shire continues to lobby Baxalta\u2019s shareholders and, in theory, can sustain the bear-hug tactics for weeks yet because the US does not place UK-style \u201cput up or shut up\u201d demands on bidders. The UK way seems cleaner and fairer all round. More exciting, too.",

      "bodyText": "The euro fell sharply and stock markets rose after the European Central Bank boss said he was ready to provide more stimulus to prevent the eurozone\u2019s faltering economy being hit by worries over China. The ECB\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said the eurozone\u2019s growth prospects had suffered in recent months and could worsen if the slowdown in China and turmoil in emerging markets took a turn for the worse. He said he expected to have a better sense of the outlook for the Chinese economy after the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank policymakers in Turkey at the weekend, but in the meantime he held open the possibility of pumping further funds into the Europe\u2019s banking system to boost growth. \u201cWe are observing a weakening of the prospects of the Chinese economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has two effects substantially. One is through the trade channel, weakening the economies of the rest of the world \u2026 and the confidence effect on the stock market and all the other financial markets, which is also operating on the negative side.\u201d Draghi\u2019s comments echoed a report earlier this week from the International Monetary Fund that said weakening growth in emerging markets, largely in response to a cut in China\u2019s forecasts, would damage the recovery of the global economy. The IMF said central banks should maintain flows of cheap credit to households and businesses and consider opening the taps further if the global situation deteriorates. Stock markets have gained and lost trillions of dollars in recent weeks as traders wrestle with a stream of dire economic figures from China. The data, which included an 8% fall in exports in July, has triggered a series of responses from Beijing that included cutting the value of the yuan and buying the shares of smaller companies on the Shanghai exchange. Despite the IMF\u2019s caution, the US Federal Reserve meets on 17 September to consider raising its main interest rate. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said last weekend that the UK was on track for higher borrowing costs early next year. Draghi said the G20 summit was an opportunity to find out whether the current downturn was a blip or a more protracted situation. \u201cWe do expect to have much more visibility than we have today in the coming days of the G20 in Ankara. That is going to be one of the major themes of the meetings.\u201d The ECB, which kept interest rates on hold, has already started a \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3802bn) government bond-buying programme this year. The quantitative easing (QE) scheme, which involves injecting \u20ac60bn into the banking system each month, is due to end in September 2016, but assets purchases can run for longer if necessary, Draghi said. The stimulus is intended to help get consumer price inflation back toward the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2%. In the year to August, it stood at 0.2%. Draghi said it could go negative in the coming months following recent oil price falls. The euro dropped 1% against the dollar and the yen as traders bet on the ECB flooding the eurozone with extra funds in an effort to counteract some of the fallout from Asia. Stock markets jumped at the prospect of cheap credit and a lower-value euro boosting business profits. The German Dax and French CAC rose by more than 2.5% and the FTSE climbed 110 points to 6194, up 1.8%. Howard Archer, the chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, said Draghi was preparing the ground for further stimulus with his remarks. \u201cThe door is now clearly wide open to the ECB stepping up its near-term pace of QE and/or increasing its overall size and duration,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether the ECB steps through that door will clearly depend on whether eurozone growth continues to struggle and inflation prospects deteriorate further.\u201d Andrew Bosomworth, a spokesman for the bond fund manager Pimco, said the ECB was beginning to mimic the Bank of Japan as it struggled to deal with a stagnating economy buffeted by volatile financial markets. \u201cThe ECB has limited confidence in reaching its inflation objective over the next two years, the policy-relevant time horizon, suggesting more stimulus might be needed. \u201cWhile the ECB\u2019s QE programme was always open-ended from the start, downside risks to the 2017 inflation forecast raise the likelihood the ECB increases the quantity of bonds it purchases each month from \u20ac60bn or continues QE beyond September next year.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thousands of parents have been left with a last-minute scramble to buy school uniforms, or been forced to send children back to lessons without the correct clothing, after Tesco failure to keep up with demand for customised shirts and sweaters. Up to 2,000 customers did not receive their items \u2013 embroidered with individual school crests \u2013 in time for the start of term, even though some placed their orders up to six weeks before lessons began. Parents complained of orders failing to arrive on time or last-minute cancellations, giving them little time to source uniforms from alternative suppliers. The supermarket launched its embroidery service in 2010, expanding to supply uniforms for more than 4,000 schools around Britain. It said the supply problems had been due to an exceptional number of orders this year. Claire Burrows, from Eccles, Lancashire, said she would be forced to send her nine-year-old son, Callum, to school in an ill-fitting uniform from last year because her order of three polo shirts and three sweatshirts had been delayed at the last minute. She received a text message from the company on Tuesday, two days before its latest promised date for delivery, saying that \u201cdue to high demand\u201d the order had been delayed until 11 September. \u201cI have one set of uniform [clothes] left from last year \u2013 I binned the rest but there was one in a bag in the boot of a car that Callum left at my mother\u2019s house. But it is not new and he will not be happy. They shouldn\u2019t take orders and promise delivery within 21 days if they can\u2019t meet demand. I won\u2019t use this service again through Tesco.\u201d Leann Chinn, from Dudley, said she had placed an order for jumpers, polo shirts and a T-shirt for her five-year-old son, Cayd, on 11 August, leaving plenty of time for delivery before he started school, in year 1, on 3 September. After chasing the company last week, she received an email saying the delivery would be delayed. A text message then promise the items would arrive on the day he started school, but they did not. \u201cLuckily we have got a school shop quite close, but to buy one polo shirt and one school shirt cost me \u00a318 on top of the \u00a345 I have spent [with Tesco].

      "bodyText": "Pizza Express has become the latest restaurant chain to reverse its policy of taking a cut from tips to waiting staff after a union campaign and a backlash from customers. Waiters called for public support after revealing the 430-branch chain was keeping 8p out of every \u00a31 of tips paid by card, earning the company an estimated \u00a31m a year from what it called an admin fee, according to Unite, the union representing the waiting staff. It later emerged that Pizza Express was not the only chain to take money from staff tips, but now, after protests, media exposes and the opening of a government inquiry into the practice, the chain has announced it will ditch the policy. From 6 October tips made on card at any Pizza Express branch will be fully distributed among restaurant staff according to a formula agreed by the chain\u2019s tronc committee, with 30% going to cleaners and kitchen staff and 70% to the individual waiter. The chain did not admit to bowing to pressure, saying the change was made possible by a new automated system to distribute tips. This system, developed over the past six months, replaced a labour-intensive manual procedure, a company blogpost said. Nevertheless, trade unions hailed it as a victory. Unite released a statement saying champagne corks were popping over the decision and praising staff for taking a brave stand against bosses. \u201cWe will turn tonight\u2019s demo at the Baker Street Pizza Express into a short victory celebration \u2013 a truly champagne moment \u2013 and call on other chains to follow the lead of Giraffe and Pizza Express,\u201d Dave Turnbull, Unite regional officer, said. But the union said work would continue, with a number of other restaurants \u2013 including Ask Italian, Prezzo, Belgo, Strada, Caf\u00e9 Rouge, Bella Italia and Zizzi \u2013 accused of not paying fair tips to staff. Giraffe last month announced it was reversing its policy of skimming a 10% admin fee off tips. Those restaurants continuing the practice face mounting pressure. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, launched an investigation into the abuse of tipping last month, days after intervening in the row by saying chains should pay their tips. The inquiry, which will run until 10 November, will examine whether or not government intervention is necessary. It could lead to a limit being put on the amount that can be withheld, or the naming and shaming of chains who do not pass on tips. Unite welcomed the investigation, but rejected the suggestion that the problem could be solved by putting a cap on the amount taken. That, it said, would simply legitimise the practice and would be difficult to enforce. Announcing the Pizza Express decision, Richard Hodgson, the company\u2019s chief executive, said he agreed with calls for more transparency across the food and drink industry so that customers could make an informed choice about tipping. \u201cWe recognise that our team members are critical to delivering the fantastic customer experience that Pizza Express has built over many years,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cAs a leader in the casual-dining industry, we\u2019re committed to best practice and to ensuring that our people are properly rewarded for the valuable contribution they make to our business.\u201d But Turnbull said the fight was not over. He called for a radical revision of the tronc system that dictates how tips are distributed. He said: \u201cTo ensure the process of allocating tips is wholly independent from employers we want to see new guidance on tronc schemes that ensure only waiting staff themselves are eligible to hold positions, such as tronc \u2018master\u2019 and on the tronc committee. \u201cAlso such officers should be nominated and elected by staff and are obligated to consult widely with all staff before contemplating any future changes to the distribution and share of tips.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "ECB press conference: Markets jump as Draghi hints at more QE - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s stock markets have just shut for the day, with big gains across the board as investors anticipate more stimulus measure from the ECB. The FTSE 100 closed up 110 points, or 1.8%, at 6194 - further away from the losses suffered a week ago. All the main indices jumped, as Mario Draghi\u2019s warnings of lower growth and weaker inflation triggered expectations of more bond-buying from Europe\u2019s central bank. Marchel Alexandrovich of Jefferies, the investment bank, says Draghi gave a clear signal that he would act if needed: Facing a deterioration in the external environment, the ECB nudged down its economic forecasts and opened the door for potentially increasing the scale of the QE programme. All-in-all, the changes to its macroeconomic forecasts were fairly marginal; but to put things into perspective, this is a first downgrade to the euro area\u2019s prospects since last December, so the changes may be small, but they are symbolically important...... As in March and in June, the ECB is on the record stating that it is prepared to ease policy if data does not meet expectations. At a time of heightened global uncertainty, even such a simple message is a good start. And that has left the euro sharply down tonight; it has shed more than one cent against the US dollar to languish around $1.1107 For a full summary, check out the key points from Draghi\u2019s press conference. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow, when we get the latest US jobs data. Goodnight. GW Investec have sent over a handy explanation of the tweaks that the ECB is making to its asset purchase plan (announced early in today\u2019s press conference): The change will see the Public Sector Purchase Programme issue share limit raised from 25% to 33%, except where the Eurosystem would have a blocking minority. This change appears to be aimed at reinforcing views that the ECB maintained full control over its purchases and could work easily around market impediments; indeed Mr Draghi said it was meant to ensure the continued smooth functioning of the programme. We note that Germany in particular could have found itself running up against the 25% limit, so the adjustment today should support the ECB, for example, in buying its full allocation for Germany. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, reckons the European Central Bank will set sail on QE2 soon, following today\u2019s \u201cunambiguously dovish\u201d press conference: \u201cDraghi presented a double-whammy of pessimism, with additional downside risks from recent market volatility adding to the already downgraded growth and inflation forecasts.\u201d Should we see the very real risks of free-falling commodity prices and a weakened growth outlook begin to weigh down on inflation prospects, Draghi has shown his intention to act by altering the duration, composition, or size of QE. Unless some upside price pressure materialises, the ECB will be forced to follow the Fed and Bank of Japan in a second QE programme.\u201d Enrique Diaz Alvarez, Chief Risk Officer and Currency Expert at Ebury, predicts that the euro will continue to weaken in the months ahead. Here\u2019s why: \u201cThe ECB is committed to easier monetary policy, and today\u2019s press conference has reaffirmed that this commitment explicitly includes a lower euro. \u201cWhile there were no changes to the ECB policy stance, President Draghi sent the Euro sharply lower right at the start of the press conference with comments and projections that were extremely dovish. \u201cHe specifically mentioned a weaker Euro as a key lever to the European economic recovery. Inflation and growth forecasts were also slashed, with Draghi suggesting that we may see negative inflation again soon. \u201cIn light of this, our view is that the common currency will resume a gently depreciating path against most other major currencies over the coming months, particularly against the US dollar.\u201d Mario Draghi\u2019s ability to move the markets without actually doing anything has left Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services shaking his head in admiration. The sleight of hand in terms of a renewed dose of \u2018all talk and no action\u2019 was once again masterful, above all in emphasizing the ECB\u2019s dovishness and hefty easing bias. However, the ECB hasn\u2019t actually discussed extending QE today, Ostwald points out. ECB president Mario Draghi gave a clear signal that additional monetary easing is likely in the coming months, says Nick Kounis of ABN Amro. Here\u2019s his early take: The ECB lowered its 2017 inflation forecast as well as now seeing downside risks to these forecasts. At 1.7%, the new medium term forecast is already arguably below its price stability goal, while developments since that forecast was made, suggest it could be downgraded further. We therefore now think that the ECB will like step up its QE programmes going forward. This will likely mean an increase in the monthly purchase amount as well as an expansion of the pool of eligible assets. Wall Street has also welcomed Mario Draghi\u2019s pledge to take more stimulus measure if needed. The Dow Jones industrial average, and the broader S&amp;P 500, are both up by almost 1%. We won\u2019t call it a vintage performance from Mario Draghi, as that might sound agist on his birthday. But it was a timely reminder that the ECB president can move the markets like the best of them, as European shares rise and the euro takes a bath. Here\u2019s a quick summary 1) The ECB is gloomy, and getting gloomier. As feared, the ECB has cut its forecasts for growth and inflation over the next few years, admitting that inflation will still be below target by 2017 (see details here) As Draghi put it: Overall, we expect the economic recovery to continue, albeit at a somewhat weaker pace than earlier expected, reflecting in particular the slowdown in emerging market economies, which is weighing on global growth and foreign demand for euro area exports But the big worry is that these forecasts don\u2019t take into account the turmoil which gripped the markets in the last three weeks, rippling out from China. 2) The ECB may be forced to extend its stimulus programme again. In Draghi\u2019s words: [the governing council] emphasises its willingness and ability to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within its mandate and, in particular, recalls that the asset purchase programme provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting the size, composition and duration of the programme. That means it could buy more than \u20ac60bn of assets per month, or keep buying beyond the current cut-off target in a year\u2019s time. 3) The markets smell more cheap money. Nearly seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the financial world is still driven by central banks. Europe\u2019s stock markets are romping ahead, led by Germany\u2019s DAX: 4) Draghi is worried about China\u2019s slowdown. China will be a key issue at the G20 meeting this weekend, with the ECB concerned that the slowdown in the country\u2019s economy is going to cause serious problems. He said: We are observing a weakening of the prospects of the Chinese economy. This has two effects substantially: one is through the trade channel, weakening the economies of the rest of the world... and the confidence effect on the stock market and all the other financial markets, which is also operating on the negative side. 5) Greece must do its homework The Greek debt crisis got less attention than usual, now that the bailout deal has been agreed. But Athens must do more to satisfy the ECB before it will agree to include Greek bonds in its QE programme: First, Greece must be in a program for financial assistance, it must comply with it, and must then show \u201cstrong ownership and consistent and significant implementation\u201d. There will be some milestones that will be judged and assessed in the weeks ahead and based on that assessment the Governing Council will take a decision. A slice of birthday cake for CNBC\u2019s Carolin Roth, who wishes Draghi a happy birthday. She also gets Draghi to talk about China -- he explains that the slowdown of the Chinese economy will have an impact on trade channels across the globe. He\u2019ll be pushing Chinese officials for answers at the G20 meeting this weekend. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. I\u2019ll pull together a summary and some instant reaction now. Francesco Papadia, a former senior official at the ECB, puts Draghi\u2019s last comments into context: Why are European countries struggle to achieve close integration? These countries fought for centuries, Draghi replies. But after the second world war, they all recognised that integration was fundamentally a political process designed to guarantee permanent peace in Europe. The union isn\u2019t perfect. More progress is needed towards fiscal integration, but each crisis pushes Europe closer (he cites the Five Presidents\u2019 report, which proposed a common eurozone treasury) There was no discussion about expanding QE today, Draghi insists. No-one on the governing council wanted to do it. We didn\u2019t discuss whether interest rates have reached the \u2018lower bound\u2019, says Draghi. They are currently at record lows, of course, with eurozone banks already paying negative interest rates on their deposits at the ECB. Back to China. Draghi says the ECB \u201ctook note\u201d of the devaluation of the yuan last month (I bet they did!). He expects to hear more details at the G20 meeting of central bankers and finance chiefs this weekend. Can the ECB do anything to address the refugee crisis that is unfolding in Europe? Draghi replies that: \u201cAny European should be horrified by the tragic loss of life on our doorstep. The ECB simply doesn\u2019t have any democratic mandate to act in this sphere so it\u2019s a question for our elected leaders, but this certainly shouldn\u2019t hamper our most heartfelt participation to what is happening.\u201d (updated with full quote) Is the worst of the market turbulence over, or does the ECB expect more volatility? Draghi says we must wait to see whether the last few weeks is short-term volatility, or permanent volatility. The latter would increase risk premia, and mean that today\u2019s forecasts on growth and inflation may be too optimistic. Right now, we don\u2019t know for sure. The ECB hasn\u2019t discussed how it could expand its QE programme, says Mario Draghi. We\u2019re not there yet. The ECB has also cut the emergency support provided to Greece today, from \u20ac89.7bn to \u20ac89.1bn. Don\u2019t worry, though. That\u2019s an encouraging sign, as it means there is more liquidity coming back into the banking sector. Draghi thinks the ECB announced it before the press pack sniffed it out. Bloomberg begs to differ..... Onto Greece. Draghi confirms that the ECB insisted that Greek bank depositors were protected from any haircuts on their savings. Could the ECB reinstate the \u2018waiver\u2019 that allowed it to buy Greek bonds despite the low credit rating? That can\u2019t happen unless a country is in a bailout programme, and complying with it, Draghi replies. And there must be a debt-sustainability analysis. That suggests Greece must wait for the first review of its third bailout (once it has got this month\u2019s election out of the way) Is the ECB chasing the wrong inflation target (close to, but below 2%)? Draghi says the governing council hasn\u2019t discussed whether the target is still appropriate. And on the strength of the euro, he says the exchange rate isn\u2019t a policy target, but it is very important for price stability and growth. That looks like a sabre-rattle in the direction of the Currency Wars - if so, it worked, as the euro keeps falling: He adds that This press conference is much less cheerful than the one in mid-July. Mario Draghi then drops another big hint that the ECB could expand its bond-buying programme beyond September 2016. Our new forecasts were drawn up on August 12, Draghi explains. That\u2019s shortly before China\u2019s Black Monday, which roiled stock markets worldwide. Thus, there are downside risks to the current forecasts, meaning growth could be even weaker and inflation even lower. European stock markets are surging, as traders anticipate further stimulus measures from the ECB: Over at the Frankfurt stock market, the German DAX has jumped by 217 points, or over 2%. A weaker euro is very good news for German exporters. Onto questions: Q: What\u2019s the downside risk to the ECB\u2019s forecasts of 0.1% inflation rate this year? And what more can you do about it? Draghi replies that we could see negative inflation prints in the months ahead, but due to lower oil and commodity prices rather than full-blown deflation. And the Governing Council is committed to doing everything in its power, he reiterates. The euro has fallen by almost one cent against the US dollar during Mario Draghi\u2019s statement. The ECB has lowered its forecasts for growth and inflation this year, and in 2016 and 2017. That shows why Draghi is hinting at fresh stimulus measures: Here\u2019s the details: Draghis also drops a clear hint that the ECB could expands its quantitative easing programme, given the new downside risks. We will use all the tools in our mandate if needed, he insists. He points out that the ECB\u2019s asset purchase scheme is flexible, and the central bank could change the size, composition and duration of the programme. (it is currently buying \u20ac60bn of assets each month, and due to run until September 2016). Analysts say Draghi has just announced a small, but significant, tweak to the ECB\u2019s QE programme As expected, Draghi is sounding dovish. He warns that \u2018renewed downside risks\u201d have emerged to the outlook for growth, and inflation, in recent weeks. Draghi is reading his prepared statement. He confirms that the ECB left interest rates unchanged. Our asset purchase scheme (QE) continues to proceed smoothly, he continues. And then he drops a surprise! The EC has decided to increase the share limit on its public sector purchase programme, from 25% to 33%. That means the ECB could buy more of a single asset, addressing fears that it might run out of bonds to buy. Here we go. Mario Draghi is entering the room, fashionably late as usual. No sign of birthday cake crumbs on his suit, but he may be sporting a birthday haircut. Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference is being streamed live, here: Mario Draghi is a tricky man to predict, so traders who expect strong hints about more stimulus measures could be disappointed. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Markets reckons Draghi will probably \u201ckeep his powder dry\u201d until we get more clarity about the global economy, and learn whether the US raises interest rates this month. She warns: President Draghi\u2019s dovishness could fall short of market expectations and surprise the looming ECB doves by pushing the euro higher against the US dollar and pound. Here\u2019s the official announcement: What better way to mark your 68th birthday than a press conference in Frankfurt? Draghi has certainly seen enough confetti this year already, following April\u2019s antics. To no-one\u2019s surprise, the European Central Bank has voted to leave interest rates unchanged. That means: The refinancing rate (the headline cost of borrowing) is still 0.05%. The marginal lending rate (paid by banks to borrow from the ECB) is still 0.3% The deposit facility rate (on bank deposits at the ECB) is still -0.2% (meaning banks face a negative interest rate). Next up, the press conference in 45 minutes. Right, it\u2019s time to turn our attention to European Central Bank day. Here\u2019s what economists and investors are looking out for from Mario Draghi at this afternoon\u2019s press conference: 1) Lower forecasts. With the oil price still weak, and emerging market growth slowing, it\u2019s hard to see how the ECB can avoid revising down its forecasts for inflation in 2015 and 2016. We get new growth forecasts too. 2) More QE? If inflation is weak, shouldn\u2019t the ECB respond with a renewed burst of quantitative easing? Investors expect a hint today, so the markets could be volatile if Draghi disappoints. 3) China. How much damage could the Chinese slowdown cause to the eurozone recovery, and what might the ECB do about it? 4) Financial volatility. European stock markets have fallen by around 12% since the ECB\u2019s last meeting in mid-July. Should we expect more turbulence, and might this affect policymaking in Frankfurt? 5) Greece. Draghi could talk about capital controls, and the possibility of including Greece in the ECB\u2019s QE programme. He may also get quizzed about this month\u2019s general election, as former prime minister Alexis Tsipras continues to lose ground in the polls. Could the bailout deal be heading off the rails? Time for a recap, before the ECB\u2019s decision on monetary policy (12.45pm BST) followed by its press conference (1.30pm BST). World stock markets have bounced back from their recent losses, as investors anticipate fresh hints that the European Central Bank could expand its stimulus measures. At noon, the FTSE 100 index had jumped 1.4%, with healthy rises on all the main indices. Earlier, Asia\u2019s stock markets also rallied, after several days of losses. Investors were given a day off from worrying about China (the Shanghai market was shut), and could admire the huge array of military might which marched, drove and soared through Beijing instead. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, sums up the mood: \u201cMajor equity markets climbed this morning thanks to a late rally in the US (in spite of mixed data) as well as a largely positive session in Asia overnight. A two-day Chinese holiday is providing welcome regional respite from volatility linked to growth-concerns in the world\u2019s number 2 economy and of course its global knock-on effect. There was encouraging news for the eurozone, with companies reporting the fastest pick-up in growth in four years. Spain shone, but France lagged behind. Growth in the UK service sector growth has slowed a little, though: US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has warned Beijing not to mess too much with the value of the yuan. America has long been concerned that China has been keeping the yuan unfairly low, even before last month\u2019s surprise devaluations. Treasury secretary Jack Lew has now fired a warning at Beijing to play fairly and let the yuan float more freely. Speaking to CNBC, Lew said: \u201cThey have to understand, and I make this point to them quite clearly, that there\u2019s an economic and a political reality to things like exchange rates. They need to understand that they signal their intentions by the actions they take and the way they announce them. And they have to be very clear that they\u2019re continuing to move in a positive direction. We\u2019re going to hold them accountable.\u201d Something for Beijing policymakers to ponder, now their military shindig is over. Wall Street is expected to join the rally in a few hours time: US equity market calls (via CMC Markets) S&amp;P 500: 10 points higher at 1,958 Dow Jones: 76 points higher at 16,427 Nasdaq 100: 31 points higher at 4,287 The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that Mario Draghi will hint at further moves to ease monetary policy at this afternoon\u2019s press conference. They reckon the ECB\u2019s bond-buying programme, due to end in September 2016, could be extended by almost another year. By then, though, European politicians must have implemented serious reforms. Despite today\u2019s rally, European markets are still sharply lower than one month ago - before fears over the global economy rattled investors. While Europe picks up pace, Britain\u2019s service sector growth has slowed to its slowest rate in 27 months. The UK services PMI dipped to 55.6 in August, from 57.4, suggesting the recovery weakened last month. That\u2019s still shows quite solid expansion. But with manufacturing growth also slowing in August, Markit predicts overall growth of just 0.5% this quarter, down from 0.7% in April-June. European investors are cheering the surge in eurozone private sector growth last month. The FTSE 100 is now up by 103 points, or 1.7%, while Germany\u2019s DAX is 1.8% higher. Today\u2019s PMI reports are helping to ease concerns over Europe\u2019s economy, as Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight explains: IHS believes that the Eurozone should be able to achieve reasonable, if unspectacular growth over the coming months \u2013 although the threat to global growth that could come from a marked Chinese slowdown clearly poses a downside risk. The increase in eurozone private sector growth means even less chance that the ECB will announce new stimulus measures today. So argues Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi, who predicts plenty of questions about China at this afternoon\u2019s press conference: Despite the slowdown in France, the eurozone\u2019s private sector is growing at its fastest rate in four years. Data firm Markit just released its Eurozone composite PMI, and it shows that output expanded more quickly in August. The easing of the Greek debt crisis appears to have boosted confidence, encouraging companies to hire extra staff to handle a rise in business. Markit\u2019s Final Eurozone Services Business Activity Index rose to 54.4, up from July 54.0. And if you include the latest manufacturing data, the final Eurozone Composite Output Index rose to 54.3, up from July\u2019s 53.9. Chris Williamson of Markit says Spain\u2019s performance was particularly impressive, while France appears to be stalling again: \u201cAlthough global economic worries have intensified in recent weeks, the calming of Grexit fears has led to an improvement in the business environment across the eurozone, pushing the pace of economic growth to its fastest for just over four years in August. The PMI is indicating euro area GDP growth close to 0.4% in the third quarter, a solid albeit unspectacular rate of expansion. \u201cThe upturn was stronger than recorded by the flash reading, thanks mainly to stronger growth in Germany and the best performance for over four years in Italy, where the PMIs are both pointing to 0.5% GDP growth in the third quarter. But it is Spain that remains the star performer among the largest eurozone countries, with the PMI signalling another 1.0% GDP growth spurt in the third quarter. \u201cThe worrying deterioration of growth in France is a major concern, the PMI dropping below the flash reading to signal a near-stagnation of the economy in the third quarter, but the ECB will be reassured by the ability of the eurozone economy as a whole to withstand recent headwinds. Not for the first time (or the last, I fear), Germany\u2019s economy has outperformed France. The German service sector PMI rose to 54.9 last month, from 53.8 in July, indicating faster growth. Companies reported an increase in output and new business, meaning they could hire more staff and even raise prices. That last point will please the ECB as it wonders if inflation can pick up. Less encouragingly, France\u2019s service sector came off the boil last month and only reported modest growth: Now this is encouraging -- Italy\u2019s service sector just grew at the fastest pace since the early days of the financial crisis. The Italian Services PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, jumped to 54.6 in August, from 52.0 in July. Markit reports that: Business activity increases at solid and accelerated pace Employment returns to growth, rising modestly However, business expectations weakened to their lowest level this year. Sweden\u2019s central bank has resisted the temptation to cut borrowing costs to fresh record lows. The Riksbank left benchmark interest rates unchanged at minus 0.35%, but did hint that it could do more, saying: \u201cThe Riksbank remains highly prepared to make monetary policy even more expansionary in the event of inflation prospects deteriorating.\u201d Budget airline easyJet is leading the FTSE 100 risers in London. Shares surged by almost 7%, after raising its profit forecasts and reporting record traffic levels in August. Up we go again! European stock markets have jumped at the start of trading, as investors pile into shares ahead of the ECB meeting. The FTSE 100 leapt by 86 points, or nearly 1.5%, with traders anticipating that Mario Draghi may suggest new stimulus moves at this afternoon\u2019s press conference in Frankfurt. The absence of any dramatic swings in China may have helped the mood too, helping the City has shrugged off its recent angst over the global economy. Spain\u2019s services companies have posted another month of solid growth, as its economy continues to recover. The Spanish Services PMI came in at 59.6 in August, down very slightly on July\u2019s 59.7 but still a strong result (any reading over 50 shows growth). Measures of new business and job creation remained robust too. Overnight, the International Monetary Fund has warned that the downside risks to global growth have risen, partly due to the slowdown in China. In a new report, ahead of the G20 finance ministers meeting in Ankara this weekend, the Fund said: Near-term downside risks for emerging economies have increased, given the combination of China\u2019s growth transition, lower commodity prices, potential adverse corporate balance sheet and funding challenges related to a dollar appreciation, and capital flow reversals and disruptive asset price shifts. The IMF also warned that global interest rates may have to stay low for even longer -- a signal to the Federal Reserve not to hike borrowing costs this month? Most mornings recently, we\u2019ve been glued to the twists and turns on the Chinese stock market. Not today, though. The Shanghai index is closed until Monday, so Beijing could hold a parade to mark its victory over Japan and the end of the second world war. And what an event it was, with masses of tanks, planes and troops on display. Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin was there too; Britain, curiously, was represented by Ken Clarke MP, the long-serving former minister. My colleague Claire Phipps live-blogged the whole thing: And Tom Phillips tweeted from Tiananmen Square: After some tough days, Asia\u2019s markets are staging a modest recovery today. Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped by 0.7%, following three days of losses, and there are also gains in South Korea and India. But there are still concerns over how the region will fare, given the turbulence in China. Angus Nicholson of IG reports \u201cgrowing concern\u201d about the Japanese banking sector, which may have made some reckless loans. In the face of poor growth prospects in Japan, banks aggressively began lending to emerging Asian nations. With the massive falls seen in emerging market currencies over the past twelve months or so, defaults on these loans have been soaring. This is likely to be a major headwind to the performance of the Nikkei over the coming months as well. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s European Central Bank day. President Mario Draghi and the governing council are gathering in Frankfurt to set monetary policy, and discuss the state of Europe\u2019s economy. Economists believe the central bank could downgrade its inflation forecast, with price pressures stubbornly low and growth still somewhat sluggish. Draghi may also hint that the ECB could launch future stimulus measures, if inflation doesn\u2019t pick up soon. It\u2019s currently just 0.2%, compared to a target of just below 2%. And he\u2019ll also field a few questions about Greece, where the banking sector is still gripped by capital controls. Draghi is quite capable of talking the euro down if he fancies it, and the prospect of a dovish performance from the ECB chief will push shares higher this morning: Ian Williams of stockbroker Peel Hunt says: Investors will be looking to ECB President Draghi for more supportive comments later today. Today\u2019s agenda: Sweden\u2019s central bank is also meeting today. It could potentially cut interest rates deeper into negative territory to spur inflation. New PMI surveys of the world\u2019s service sector are released today, which will show if growth eased in August. We also find out how many Americans claimed unemployment benefit last week, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s eagerly awaited Non-Farm Payroll report. 8am-9am BST: eurozone service sector PMIs for August 8.30am BST: Swedish interest rate decision 9.30am BST: UK service sector PMI 12.45pm BST: The European Central Bank announces its interest rate decision 1.30pm BST: Press conference with ECB president Mario Draghi. 1.30pm BST: Last week\u2019s US jobless claims 3pm BST: US service sector PMI I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events though the day.",

We get new growth forecasts too.</p> <p>2) <strong>More QE?</strong> If inflation is weak, shouldn\u2019t the ECB respond with a renewed burst of quantitative easing? Investors expect a hint today, so the markets could be volatile if Draghi disappoints. </p> <p>3) <strong>China.</strong> How much damage could the Chinese slowdown cause to the eurozone recovery, and what might the ECB do about it?</p> <p>4) <strong>Financial volatility</strong>. European stock markets have fallen by around 12% since the ECB\u2019s last meeting in mid-July. Should we expect more turbulence, and might this affect policymaking in Frankfurt?</p> <p>5) <strong>Greece.</strong> Draghi could talk about capital controls, and the possibility of including Greece in the ECB\u2019s QE programme. </p> <p>He may also get quizzed about this month\u2019s general election, as former prime minister Alexis Tsipras continues to lose ground in the polls.

    "webTitle": "HSBC rules out revival of Midland brand for UK high street banking arm", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC has demonstrated its commitment to its high street banking operations in the UK by rejecting the idea of reviving the Midland name that hung over its 1,000-strong branch network 20 years ago. The bank, which is based in Britain and has operations in 73 countries, announced in June that it would rebrand its UK business \u2013 and fuelled speculation it could potentially sell them off \u2013 as a result of the rules that require high street banking to be ringfenced from investment banking. HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said at the time that the new rules \u2013 devised by a committee chaired by Sir John Vickers \u2013 required a rebranding for customers to be able to differentiate between the the two arms of the bank. The UK business will be known as HSBC UK. Gulliver had already said the ringfenced bank, which will employ 26,000 staff, will be based in Birmingham \u2013 the former centre of Midland bank, which HSBC bought in 1992. Announcing that UK would be added to the HSBC name, Gulliver said: \u201cAs outlined at our investor update in June, setting up the UK ringfenced bank in Birmingham is a key strategic action for the group. \u201cOur ambition is to be the bank of choice in the UK and as a name, HSBC UK will build on the global connectivity and customer trust of the HSBC brand and differentiate us in a competitive market\u201d. It was not immediately clear whether the red and white logo that HSBC uses across its global operations, and which features on airbridges at Heathrow airport, will remain part of its UK facias. A new brand look will be rolled out across the country from 1 January 2018, 12 months before the deadline for the ringfencing rules to be implemented. HSBC did not disclose how many people had taken part in the three-month consultation about the new name for its UK operations, but it said retail, private and commercial banking customers and customer-facing staff, had all been part of the process. There was no update to the ongoing review into whether to shift the bank\u2019s headquarters out of the UK, with Hong Kong regarded as the most likely alternative. Gulliver has said the outcome of the review, which was announced before the current stock market turmoil, will be revealed by the end of the year. Since HSBC raised a question mark over keeping its skyscraper headquarters in London\u2019s Canary Wharf just weeks before May\u2019s general election, George Osborne has watered down the bank levy which had cost HSBC as much as \u00a3700m a year.

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group has warned it is on course to break even at best this year, despite returning a profit in the first six months after a strong performance at its convenience stores and funeral homes. The mutual said investment in new stores, IT and higher staff pay meant it could make a small loss for the full 12 months \u2013 down from a \u00a3124m profit last year. It has spent about \u00a3125m on price cuts, mostly on fruit and vegetables, over the summer which will affect profit margins in the second half. Richard Pennycook, chief executive, said: \u201cWe\u2019re making real progress in rebuilding the Co-op and getting back to what makes us different as an organisation, focused on members and the communities in which they live ... We\u2019re fixing the basics, investing for the future and it\u2019s working.\u201d Pre-tax profit rose to \u00a336m in the six months to 4 July compared with a \u00a39m loss in the same period a year before, even though there was a slight fall in group revenues to \u00a34.6bn from \u00a34.7bn. The small decline was a result of a fall in sales at the Co-op\u2019s insurance and electrical goods businesses. Sales at the group\u2019s established food stores rose 0.8% in the six months to 4 July as they coped with a tough market in which all the big supermarkets have seen sales fall. The Co-op\u2019s convenience stores increased sales by 3.3%, excluding gains from new stores. The group also conducted 12% more funerals, as a rise in death rates led to its busiest start to the year since 2008. Growth at the convenience stores was partly helped by \u00a3300m of discount vouchers and \u201cswipe and win\u201d prizes for Co-op members handed out over the half year as Pennycook said it was a priority for the group to ensure that membership felt worthwhile. Sales were boosted by a near 50% rise in capital expenditure to \u00a3144m over the six months. Pennycook said the money had been spent on improving the look of existing stores as well as on 35 new convenience stores, IT systems and 10 new funeral homes. Pennycook said the Co-op would spend up to \u00a3350m in capital expenditure by the year end as it continued to modernise the business after years of underinvestment. He said the investment meant net debt was likely to rise again, to \u00a3900m, by the year end. Net debt more than halved to \u00a3570m in the first half, from \u00a31.4bn a year before. Part of that spending will be funded by the sale of unwanted larger stores \u2013 28 were sold in the half year and the Co-op intends to sell up to 300 in the long term. Pennycook said there would be no fire sale. \u201cWe don\u2019t have urgency and we don\u2019t want to push stores into the market at any price,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will spend many years working them out into the market when we can see good demand.\u201d Allan Leighton, the Co-op\u2019s chairman, said the board wasworking on plans for members to nominate and elect a fourth independent member. He said a process would be in place before the next Co-op AGM but could not put a definite timetable on it. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress but the most important thing is that we get it right,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the Co-op hopes to improve the way it communicates with members with the help of Mike Bracken, the former head of the government\u2019s digital services, who joins next month. Leighton said: \u201cWe are working on making membership really meaningful and part of that has to be the development of one member, one vote. There is a laborious process for members to interact with us and that\u2019s something we want to make a bit easier.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The eurozone\u2019s private sector is growing at its fastest rate in four years, with business confidence boosted by the easing of the Greek debt crisis despite growing fears over global growth. Improved confidence across the 19-member currency bloc prompted companies to hire more people last month to deal with rising business volumes. Spain was the star performer but growth in France almost ground to a halt, according to the latest PMI (purchasing managers index) surveys from Markit. Its monthly snapshot of activity in the eurozone services sector climbed to 54.4 in August, from 54.0 in July. When the latest manufacturing data are included, the eurozone composite output index improved to 54.3, up from July\u2019s 53.9. Fears that Greece\u2019s debt crisis might see the country evicted from the eurozone receded after it agreed a third bailout, worth \u20ac86bn (\u00a363bn), with its creditors in return for further painful economic reforms. However, China\u2019s economic slowdown and stock market turmoil have raised fresh fears over the state of the global economy, with the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, warning this week that global growth will be weaker than previously expected. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \u201cAlthough global economic worries have intensified in recent weeks, the calming of Grexit fears has led to an improvement in the business environment across the eurozone ... The PMI is indicating euro area GDP growth close to 0.4% in the third quarter, a solid albeit unspectacular rate of expansion.\u201d Activity in France slowed to a seven-month low, with the final reading at 50.2, barely above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. By contrast, private sector growth in Germany hit a five-month high with a reading of 55 while Italy also registered 55, a four-year high. Its service sector grew at the fastest pace since the early days of the financial crisis. The readings point to 0.5% GDP growth in both countries in the third quarter, Markit estimates. Growth in Spain and Ireland was even stronger, with readings of 58.8 and 59.7 respectively. Williamson said: \u201cIt is Spain that remains the star performer among the largest eurozone countries, with the PMI signalling another 1.0% GDP growth spurt in the third quarter. \u201cThe worrying deterioration of growth in France is a major concern, the PMI dropping below the flash reading to signal a near-stagnation of the economy in the third quarter, but the ECB will be reassured by the ability of the eurozone economy as a whole to withstand recent headwinds.\u201d The figures come before the European Central Bank\u2019s latest monthly meeting. It could downgrade its inflation forecast and hint at future stimulus measures. Separate official data showed retail sales beat expectations by rising 0.4% in July. ING economist Teunis Brosens said: \u201cIt seems as if the eurozone economy is temporarily immune to financial turmoil and economic setbacks, either close by in Greece or far away in China. The eurozone economy just continues its recovery, albeit at its typically European, very leisurely pace. For this reason we don\u2019t expect any new fireworks from Frankfurt today.\u201d In the UK, the dominant services sector notched up the slowest growth in over two years. The PMI came in at 55.6, down from 57.4 in July and well below the most pessimistic of economists\u2019 forecasts. Manufacturing remains lacklustre, with activity stuck at 52.5. The composite index for the private sector, which includes construction, fell from 56.7 in July to 55.3, its lowest since May 2013, though still above the eurozone\u2019s 54.4. Markit said this suggested that Britain\u2019s economy would grow by 0.5% in the third quarter, down from 0.7% in the second quarter. While hiring rates picked up slightly, they remain close to a two-year low. Williamson said: \u201cEven after allowing for the usual seasonal lull in business activity, August saw an unexpectedly sharp slowing in the pace of UK economic growth, which will add to current worries among dovish policymakers at the Bank of England.\u201d",

The PMI is indicating euro area GDP growth close to 0.4% in the third quarter, a solid albeit unspectacular rate of expansion.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e228a5c65d881b4fb6c9305b62efc58bee054f7a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/3/1441273275779/c6bd3c11-797e-46b3-815e-e188f54a9a4d-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Eurozone growth\" width=\"345\" height=\"234\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eurozone growth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Markit, Eurostat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Activity in France slowed to a seven-month low, with the final reading at 50.2, barely above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. </p> <p>By contrast, private sector growth in Germany hit a five-month high with a reading of 55 while Italy also registered 55, a four-year high.

ING economist Teunis Brosens said: \u201cIt seems as if the eurozone economy is temporarily immune to financial turmoil and economic setbacks, either close by in Greece or far away in China. The eurozone economy just continues its recovery, albeit at its typically European, very leisurely pace.

While hiring rates picked up slightly, they remain close to a two-year low.</p> <p>Williamson said: \u201cEven after allowing for the usual seasonal lull in business activity, August saw an unexpectedly sharp slowing in the pace of UK economic growth, which will add to current worries among dovish policymakers at the Bank of England.\u201d</p>",

Its shares rose 7.5p, more than 4% higher, to 170p amid the takeover talk and alongside an upgrade on the shares from brokers at UBS from sell to neutral. The shares of the UK\u2019s fourth-largest food retailer were among the biggest risers in the FTSE 100 after the acquisitive South African businessman Christo Wiese appeared to raise the idea of an expansion of his Brait investment vehicle into the UK supermarket sector. Wiese has built up the supermarket giant Shoprite in his native South Africa, while in the UK Brait has taken over New Look, the fashion retailer, the gym chain Virgin Active and taken a 19% stake in grocery chain Iceland. \u201cThe UK is extremely competitive but I can assure you it is as competitive in South Africa if not more. We South Africans find it very easy to do business in the UK; it is similar and it has the same challenges,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph. But in an interview with the Guardian a week ago, Wiese appeared to play down the idea of takeovers of supermarkets, pointing instead to putting some of Brait\u2019s \u00a31bn acquisition war chest into areas such as renewable energy. He has previously been linked with BHS, the chain created by Sir Philip Green before being sold for \u00a31 to City investors through the Retail Acquisitions vehicle. Analysts at UBS upgraded their view on the shares, which were trading at 186p a month ago. While customers are indifferent to the business, the UBS analysts said: \u201cSome of the retail fixes already put in place \u2013 notably more hours in store \u2013 look to be working and we think that the focus from management will be on the basics, such as service and availability.\u201d New management was installed at Morrisons at the start of the year when Dalton Philips was fired. The turnaround team comprises former executives of Tesco \u2013 chairman Andy Higginson, chief executive David Potts and finance director Trevor Strain \u2013 who have pledged to invest \u00a31bn over three years in cutting prices. The convenience stores M Local are also being sold off. It reports it half-year results next week. Wiese has taken steps to compete with supermarkets by backing Pep &amp; Co, a clothing discounter run by former Asda boss Andy Bond. The falls in the share prices of retailers has triggered expectations of takeovers. Mike Dennis of Cantor Fitzgerald said: \u201cIn our view, the UK and European grocery industry remains in a perfect storm of price deflation, weak demand and rising costs. This could ultimately lead to several quoted grocery brands considering a take private option that would allow management more time to review, sell off and restructure their formats and space requirements.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The engine of Britain\u2019s economic growth slipped a gear in August after the services sector expanded at its slowest rate for two years. In another sign that the UK economy is losing momentum, the Markit/Cips survey of the services sector, which generates more than three-quarters of Britain\u2019s income, found a broad slackening in activity and a decline in the confidence of businesses in the outlook for the rest of the year. Coming quickly on the heels of gloomy manufacturing figures, the latest health check of the services industry was worse than analysts had expected. The Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) of services activity dropped to a 27-month low of 55.6 from 57.4 in July. Readings above 50 signal growth in activity compared with the previous month, and below 50 contraction. The consultancy Capital Economics said the slowdown was likely to be a blip before momentum picked up again in the autumn as falling oil prices lifted household disposable incomes and eased price pressures on businesses. But the fall in confidence was blamed by some analysts on the turmoil in world markets and the protracted slowdown in China, which has become a major export market for advertisers and other services firms. Without China as the motor for global trade, some economists fear the UK\u2019s recovery will falter. Chris Williamson, chief economist at the financial data provider Markit, said even after allowing for usual seasonal influences, August saw an unexpectedly sharp slowing in the pace of economic growth. \u201cThe services PMI came in well below even the most pessimistic of economists\u2019 forecasts and follows disappointing news of a stagnation in the manufacturing sector earlier in the week. Although construction industry growth remained resilient, the three PMI surveys collectively are pointing to the weakest monthly expansion since May 2013,\u201d he said. Williamson said that a slower pace of expansion across the economy would take the pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the near future. Threadneedle Street has signalled that it is ready to beginning raising rates for the first time since 2007 next February, a move many economists now believe will be delayed until at least the summer of 2016.",

    "webTitle": "Aga saga: Middleby urges shareholders to rebuff Whirlpool", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The bidding war for Aga Rangemaster, the maker of cast-iron cookers, heated up as one of its US suitors, Middleby, urged the UK company\u2019s shareholders to approve its agreed acquisition and to be \u201cwary\u201d of a rival\u2019s approach. Aga, based in Leamington Spa, agreed in July to sell itself to food services group Middleby for \u00a3129m in cash. In the last few days, another US suitor has entered the frame: Whirlpool, the world\u2019s largest appliance maker, approached Aga about a possible cash bid. The stove maker opened its books to help the US company decide whether to make a formal offer. In a statement to the London stock exchange, Middleby questioned Whirlpool\u2019s motivation, \u201cin particular why it has waited until this late stage in the process to approach AGA\u201d. It added: \u201cMiddleby urges Aga shareholders to be wary that there is no certainty Whirlpool will ultimately make any offer.\u201d The US firm noted that any offer from Whirlpool would be subject to a number of conditions, as Aga had stated, while Middleby\u2019s acquisition had \u201cno regulatory or anti-trust conditions\u201d. This means that if the takeover were approved, shareholders would be paid within 14 days of the expected effective date of 23 September. Aga\u2019s shareholders are due to meet on 8 September to vote on the acquisition. It would be the latest traditional British brand to pass into foreign ownership: Rolls-Royce cars are now made by Germany\u2019s BMW, Weetabix is owned by China\u2019s Bright Food and Baring Private Equity Asia, and Cadbury was sold to the US food company Kraft in 2010. The battle to gain control of Aga has pitted two big US appliance makers against each other. Illinois-based Middleby, founded in 1888 as a bakery supplier, makes kitchen equipment for restaurants and households and has been on an acquisition spree in recent years. Whirlpool, founded in Michigan in 1911 as Upton Machine Company, has annual sales of $20bn (\u00a313bn). Its brands in the US include Maytag, Kitchen Aid and Jenn-Air. In the UK, Whirlpool sells washing machines, dishwashers and other appliances under its own brand. Beloved of Britain\u2019s rural middle class, the Aga was actually not invented here but by the blind Nobel Prize-winning Swedish physicist Gustaf Dal\u00e9n, in 1922. He created a cast-iron cooker capable of doing different kind of cooking simultaneously, through its two large hotplates and two ovens. Agas quickly became popular in country houses after manufacturing started in Britain under licence in 1929. Aga and Rangemaster cookers sell for up to \u00a316,000. The company also owns the upmarket Fired Earth tiles and home decoration chain. It claims the oldest Aga cooker still in operation was first installed in 1932. Aga employs 2,500 people in seven countries, including more than 2,000 at its factories with the remainder in the shops. Its main factory is in the Shropshire village of Coalbrookdale, where it has been making cookers since 1946. It also manufactures at Leamington Spa, Long Eaton, in Derbyshire, and Ketley, in Shropshire, as well as in Ireland, France, Romania, and Michigan in the US.",

      "body": "<p>The bidding war for Aga Rangemaster, the maker of cast-iron cookers, heated up as one of its US suitors, Middleby, urged the UK company\u2019s shareholders to approve its agreed acquisition and to be \u201cwary\u201d of a rival\u2019s approach.</p> <p>Aga, based in Leamington Spa, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/15/aga-sold-to-us-firm-middleby-129m-pound-deal\">agreed in July to sell itself to food services group Middleby</a> for \u00a3129m in cash. In the last few days, another US suitor has entered the frame: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/01/aga-saga-rangemaster-heats-up-stove-maker-approach-second-us-suitor\">Whirlpool, the world\u2019s largest appliance maker, approached Aga about a possible cash bid</a>. The stove maker opened its books to help the US company decide whether to make a formal offer.</p> <p>In a statement to the London stock exchange, Middleby questioned Whirlpool\u2019s motivation, \u201cin particular why it has waited until this late stage in the process to approach AGA\u201d. It added: \u201cMiddleby urges Aga shareholders to be wary that there is no certainty Whirlpool will ultimately make any offer.\u201d</p> <p>The US firm noted that any offer from Whirlpool would be subject to a number of conditions, as Aga had stated, while Middleby\u2019s acquisition had \u201cno regulatory or anti-trust conditions\u201d. This means that if the takeover were approved, shareholders would be paid within 14 days of the expected effective date of 23 September.</p> <p>Aga\u2019s shareholders are due to meet on 8 September to vote on the acquisition. It would be the latest traditional British brand to pass into foreign ownership: Rolls-Royce cars are now made by Germany\u2019s BMW, Weetabix is owned by China\u2019s Bright Food and Baring Private Equity Asia, and Cadbury was sold to the US food company Kraft in 2010.</p> <p><a href=\"http:// http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/17/aga-rangemaster-shares-rise-takeover-talks-gather-steam \">The battle to gain control of Aga</a> has pitted two big US appliance makers against each other. Illinois-based Middleby, founded in 1888 as a bakery supplier, makes kitchen equipment for restaurants and households and has been on an acquisition spree in recent years. </p> <p>Whirlpool, founded in Michigan in 1911 as Upton Machine Company, has annual sales of $20bn (\u00a313bn). Its brands in the US include Maytag, Kitchen Aid and Jenn-Air. In the UK, Whirlpool sells washing machines, dishwashers and other appliances under its own brand.</p> <p>Beloved of Britain\u2019s rural middle class, the Aga was actually not invented here but by the <a href=\"http://www.agaliving.com/buying-an-aga/about-us/history\">blind Nobel Prize-winning Swedish physicist Gustaf Dal\u00e9n, in 1922</a>. He created a cast-iron cooker capable of doing different kind of cooking simultaneously, through its two large hotplates and two ovens. Agas quickly became popular in country houses after manufacturing started in Britain under licence in 1929.</p> <p>Aga and Rangemaster cookers sell for up to \u00a316,000. The company also owns the upmarket Fired Earth tiles and home decoration chain. It claims the oldest Aga cooker still in operation was first installed in 1932.</p> <p>Aga employs 2,500 people in seven countries, including more than 2,000 at its factories with the remainder in the shops. Its main factory is in the Shropshire village of Coalbrookdale, where it has been making cookers since 1946. It also manufactures at Leamington Spa, Long Eaton, in Derbyshire, and Ketley, in Shropshire, as well as in Ireland, France, Romania, and Michigan in the US.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The National Australia Bank has ruled out funding Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine, as the country\u2019s biggest proposed coal project also lost a key customer in Korean electronics giant LG. NAB, Australia\u2019s fourth largest bank, had \u201cno plans to be involved in any financing\u201d of the controversial project, the Australian Financial Review reported. Sources said the bank would not buy in even if approached by Adani, the report said. Meanwhile, Adani has lost one of its two major outside customers for the Queensland coal, with a 4m-tonne coal deal with LG lapsing in July, Fairfax Media reported. The developments represent further setbacks for Adani, which must show the project has sufficient financial backing and customers before the Queensland government will allow it to dredge in Great Barrier Reef waters to expand its coal port. LG said in a statement that a letter of intent (LOI) signed by both companies over the deal was \u201cnon-binding and is invalid as of July 21, 2015, in accordance with the expiration of the LOI\u201d. NAB publicly distanced itself from the Carmichael mine a month after the country\u2019s biggest lender, the Commonwealth Bank, parted ways with Adani as a project finance adviser. Adani now technically retains a single major outside customer for its coal, its prospective equity partner Posco, although the Korean steelmaker\u2019s staff working on the Abbot Point coal port joint venture in Brisbane have been sent home. Most of the Carmichael coal is slated for Adani\u2019s own power business in India. Adani Mining\u2019s spokesman told the AFR it had not approached NAB for funding and the company \u201cemphatically rejects every aspect of Fairfax\u2019s characterisation of either the company\u2019s position or indeed that of NAB\u201d. Adani remains focused on obtaining government approvals for its mine, rail and port developments. It has blamed delays in those approvals for having to put much of its project work, including engineering planning and project management, on ice. Adani\u2019s travails, which include having commonwealth environmental approval for its mine overturned in the federal court last month after a challenge by conservationists, have prompted attacks by the federal government and the mining lobby on the environment movement. The Greens senator Larissa Waters called on the Abbott government to \u201cscrap its plan, supported by the Palaszczuk government, to fund the Adani mine using taxpayer money\u201d through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund. The government is understood to be considering using the fund to replace money for Adani\u2019s rail line promised by the former Newman government but dumped with the election of Palaszczuk\u2019s Labor. Waters said it was \u201ceconomically and environmentally reckless to pour taxpayer money down the drain into this dying industry\u201d. The former NAB chief executive Cameron Clyne told the AFR that \u201cNAB ruling out involvement with the Adani Carmichael coal mega-mine seems proper\u201d and \u201cprudent\u201d for shareholders. \u201cYou would be hard-pressed to find a financial institution that would make a different call to NAB\u2019s today,\u201d Clyne said. \u201cThis project, by all accounts, doesn\u2019t seem to stack up economically and appears unlikely to ever turn a profit.\u201d Clyne also spoke of Australia being \u201cheavily addicted to coal\u201d as a source of energy and growth, which he labelled \u201ceconomically reckless\u201d. NAB\u2019s announcement was welcomed by conservation groups and the Wangan and Jagalingou clans, traditional owners of the mine site, who are mounting a legal challenge to its progress through the federal court. Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners family council spokesman Adrian Burragubba said they were \u201cdeeply heartened\u201d that NAB \u201cacted with moral authority and in accordance with the principles of corporate social responsibility to which it is signatory\u201d. \u201cIts decision brings this disastrous project one step closer to its demise,\u201d he said. Greenpeace campaigner Nikola Casule said NAB had \u201cdone the right thing by the reef and has become the 14th major bank to distance itself from the stranded asset that is the Carmichael mega mine\u201d. Casule said the move put the federal government on notice that the project was unviable. He called for Westpac and ANZ, the other two of Australia\u2019s big four banks, to also rule out funding the mine project. The national director of the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, Kirsty Albion, said the project had \u201cbeen opposed by Indigenous people, tourism operators, young people, bank customers and now we\u2019re seeing it opposed in the boardrooms of Australia\u2019s biggest banks\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Low growth, low wages, low exports: GDP figures are no laughing matter", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest gross domestic product (GDP) figures show just how dependent Australia is on exports, and that when they fall away, so too do any hopes of strong (or even average) economic growth. Three months ago, when the March GDP figures showed surprisingly strong growth, Joe Hockey suggested that those who believed there were \u201cdark clouds on the horizon\u201d were \u201cclowns\u201d. Well send in the clowns, because Wednesday\u2019s GDP figures showed that Australia\u2019s economy grew by a truly laughable 0.2% in the June quarter (seasonally adjusted) and just 2.0% in the past 12 months. The trend figures showed a slightly better 0.5% quarterly growth but a still very much below-average 2.2% annual growth. That marks 11 consecutive quarters where annual growth has been less than 3%, and that in the seven years since the global financial crisis hit, only five quarters have seen Australia\u2019s economy growing above average: Weak growth any way you cut it The GDP figures come out every quarter and thus when we look at annual figures, the standard process is to compare the amount of GDP in (for example) the June quarter with that in the June quarter the year before. On this measure there is no good news to be found at all. GDP is well below the average growth of 3.1% regardless of whether you use seasonally adjusted or trend figures. GDP per capita is also woeful \u2013 it grew by just 1.0% in the past 12 months and hasn\u2019t been near the 25-year average of 1.7% growth since 2012: But because the figures marked the end of the 2014-15 financial year, the ABS also provides annual growth figures. These compare the total amount of GDP in 2014-15 with that of 2013-14. On this measure, GDP growth came in at 2.4%, and not surprisingly, this was the number Joe Hockey focused on. But this figure doesn\u2019t hold much joy either. At 2.4% it is lower than the 2.5% growth achieved in both 2012-13 and 2013-14: These annual figures also show that Australia\u2019s nominal GDP \u2013 the amount of output in the economy in current dollar terms \u2013 grew by just 1.8%. That was the lowest such result since 1961-62, figures so dismal they predate decimal currency. What happened to our exports? No one was too surprised about the poor GDP figures, because the latest balance of payments figures released on Tuesday showed that Australia\u2019s current account balance (the difference between what we export and what we import) fell by 41% in the June quarter \u2013 from a deficit of $13bn to $19bn. And the GDP figures showed just how bad the export picture was. In the June quarter, exports fell by 3.3% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the worst quarterly fall since March 2011: The quarterly figures can bounce around a bit, but even the annual picture shows a sharp fall from the peaks seen in the past six to 12 months: What this meant is that in the June quarter, net exports (exports minus imports) actually reduced GDP growth by around 0.6 percentage points (seasonally adjusted). When we look at the annual picture, net exports are still contributing to growth, but the value of that contribution has sharply fallen: The big reason is the fall in prices for our exports. The ABS calculates that the average price of Australia\u2019s exports fell 8.2% over the past year. That is bad enough, but it also estimates the price of our imports rose 2.7%: When export prices fall that much, you need to really ramp up the quantity that you export to break even, and in the past quarter we were unable to. And with that went any hope of a solid growth in our economy. So if not exports, what? Where did our growth come from \u2013 all 0.2% of it? Well, as Stephen Koukoulas rather mischievously noted on Twitter, the \u201cstatistical discrepancy\u201d in the data actually accounted for 0.2% points towards GDP growth, meaning in theory it was responsible for all of the growth. But if we put that aside, the big driver was government consumption and government fixed capital formation: On the surface this would seem to be the government finally getting its infrastructure spending going, but the big driver was defence spending. There was a 41% increase in national government fixed capital expenditure on defence in the quarter. Speculation is that this is due to the launch of the HMAS Hobart, but whatever is the reason, it certainly is not spending that will improve the productive capacity of our economy, and thus will be a very short-lived bonus. Given that defence spending contributed 0.34% points to GDP growth in the June quarter, without it the economy would have gone backwards. Oh mining boom, come back, we need you. Remember when the mining industry powered our economy? Yeah good times. Alas, gone for now. In the June quarter, production in the mining industry actually detracted from GDP growth. When looking over the past 12 months, the industry remained the fourth biggest contributor to GDP growth, but it now lags well behind the contribution from the financial and insurance service industry: Housing keeps booming Of course we knew the mining boom was over, and we hoped the transition from that would be softened by improvements in other construction areas \u2013 especially housing. Well the figures shows that investment in private dwellings continues to grow solidly: The problem \u2013 as it always has been \u2013 is that it doesn\u2019t grow strongly enough to make up for the collapse in investment in the mining industry. Dwelling investment in the past year added 0.5% points to annual GDP growth, but the fall in non-dwelling construction reduced GDP growth by 1.1% points: This means that private investment continues to fall, and while there was a slight bump in public investment due to that defence spending, growth in both remains negative: And what that all adds up to is incredibly weak demand: The defence spending helped bump demand up a very little, but with overall demand growing by just 1.2% in the past year, there is pretty much no heat in the domestic economy. Household spending is keeping us going In the June quarter, household consumption grew by 0.5% \u2013 down from the 0.65% growth in the March quarter, but enough to keep annual household consumption steady at 2.5%. And that spending was a solid contributor to GDP growth: It\u2019s here that we see why the financial and insurance industry is the biggest contributor overall to GDP growth. The biggest contributor to the increase in household spending in the June quarter was insurance and other financial services. And over the past year, rents were the biggest driver of our increased spending. But tobacco certainly was not. The June quarter saw tobacco consumption fall by 12.1% over the past 12 months \u2013 the biggest such fall ever recorded: Labour productivity collapses, as do wages For the fourth straight quarter, the annual growth of nominal unit labour costs \u2013 ie the amount is costs to produce one unit of output \u2013 fell: This is a record and highlights the utter lack of wages growth and inflation in our economy. The ABS measure for prices it uses to calculate real GDP actually fell 0.4% over the past 12 months. And thus because labour costs didn\u2019t fall by as much as that, \u201creal labour costs\u201d rose. This would suggest Australia is becoming less competitive compared to other nations, but no one of any intelligence is really considering that is because of wages growth. But productivity has taken a sharp fall \u2013 mostly because surprisingly there was a solid rise in hours worked in the past quarter. It saw annual productivity growth in the past year hit zero: The five-year annual average growth is also down to 1.6% \u2013 just a touch below the long-term average of 1.7%. But it is not a good sign especially given we can no longer rely on export prices going up to fuel our standard of living. And here we end with a nice depressing note (if you aren\u2019t depressed enough). The ABS\u2019s broader measure of the change in national economic wellbeing is real net national disposable income. And here we see the fourth consecutive quarterly fall, and our national income now being 0.7% below where it was last year: Australia\u2019s economy is still slightly growing, but we sure as heck ain\u2019t growing any richer.

The trend figures showed a slightly better 0.5% quarterly growth but a still very much below-average 2.2% annual growth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2015/sep/02/economic-management-is-now-tony-abbotts-weakest-claim-to-re-election\">Economic management is now Tony Abbott's weakest claim to re-election | Stephen Koukoulas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That marks 11 consecutive quarters where annual growth has been less than 3%, and that in the seven years since the global financial crisis hit, only five quarters have seen Australia\u2019s economy growing above average:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog1\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/t0Ep1/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"allowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Weak growth any way you cut it</h2> <p>The GDP figures come out every quarter and thus when we look at annual figures, the standard process is to compare the amount of GDP in (for example) the June quarter with that in the June quarter the year before.</p> <p>On this measure there is no good news to be found at all. GDP is well below the average growth of 3.1% regardless of whether you use seasonally adjusted or trend figures.</p> <p>GDP per capita is also woeful \u2013 it grew by just 1.0% in the past 12 months and hasn\u2019t been near the 25-year average of 1.7% growth since 2012:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZqfWj/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But because the figures marked the end of the 2014-15 financial year, the ABS also provides annual growth figures. These compare the total amount of GDP in 2014-15 with that of 2013-14.</p> <p>On this measure, GDP growth came in at 2.4%, and not surprisingly, this was the number Joe Hockey focused on.</p> <p>But this figure doesn\u2019t hold much joy either. At 2.4% it is lower than the 2.5% growth achieved in both 2012-13 and 2013-14:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iLb6W/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>These annual figures also show that Australia\u2019s nominal GDP \u2013 the amount of output in the economy in current dollar terms \u2013 grew by just 1.8%. That was the lowest such result since 1961-62, figures so dismal they predate decimal currency.</p> <h2>What happened to our exports?</h2> <p>No one was too surprised about the poor GDP figures, because the latest balance of payments figures released on Tuesday showed that Australia\u2019s current account balance (the difference between what we export and what we import) fell by 41% in the June quarter \u2013 from a deficit of $13bn to $19bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/15/australias-economy-unemployment-china-coal\">Australia's economy: is the lucky country running out of luck?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the GDP figures showed just how bad the export picture was. </p> <p>In the June quarter, exports fell by 3.3% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the worst quarterly fall since March 2011:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/u0qdU/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The quarterly figures can bounce around a bit, but even the annual picture shows a sharp fall from the peaks seen in the past six to 12 months:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"34\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dXxRw/1/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>What this meant is that in the June quarter, net exports (exports minus imports) actually reduced GDP growth by around 0.6 percentage points (seasonally adjusted).</p> <p>When we look at the annual picture, net exports are still contributing to growth, but the value of that contribution has sharply fallen:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog5\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/v7soB/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The big reason is the fall in prices for our exports. The ABS calculates that the average price of Australia\u2019s exports fell 8.2% over the past year. That is bad enough, but it also estimates the price of our imports rose 2.7%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hZqwJ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\u201dmozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"o\"llowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When export prices fall that much, you need to really ramp up the quantity that you export to break even, and in the past quarter we were unable to. And with that went any hope of a solid growth in our economy.</p> <h2>So if not exports, what?</h2> <p>Where did our growth come from \u2013 all 0.2% of it? Well, as Stephen Koukoulas rather mischievously noted on Twitter, the \u201cstatistical discrepancy\u201d in the data actually accounted for 0.2% points towards GDP growth, meaning in theory it was responsible for all of the growth.</p> <p>But if we put that aside, the big driver was government consumption and government fixed capital formation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog7\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/90hDZ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>On the surface this would seem to be the government finally getting its infrastructure spending going, but the big driver was defence spending.</p> <p>There was a 41% increase in national government fixed capital expenditure on defence in the quarter. Speculation is that this is due to the launch of the HMAS Hobart, but whatever is the reason, it certainly is not spending that will improve the productive capacity of our economy, and thus will be a very short-lived bonus.</p> <p>Given that defence spending contributed 0.34% points to GDP growth in the June quarter, without it the economy would have gone backwards.</p> <h2>Oh mining boom, come back, we need you. </h2> <p>Remember when the mining industry powered our economy? Yeah good times. Alas, gone for now.</p> <p>In the June quarter, production in the mining industry actually detracted from GDP growth. When looking over the past 12 months, the industry remained the fourth biggest contributor to GDP growth, but it now lags well behind the contribution from the financial and insurance service industry:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"8\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oGW39/1/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\u201doallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"height=\"600\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Housing keeps booming</h2> <p>Of course we knew the mining boom was over, and we hoped the transition from that would be softened by improvements in other construction areas \u2013 especially housing.</p> <p>Well the figures shows that investment in private dwellings continues to grow solidly:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"9\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Wanzh/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The problem \u2013 as it always has been \u2013 is that it doesn\u2019t grow strongly enough to make up for the collapse in investment in the mining industry.</p> <p>Dwelling investment in the past year added 0.5% points to annual GDP growth, but the fall in non-dwelling construction reduced GDP growth by 1.1% points:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"10\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Wanzh/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This means that private investment continues to fall, and while there was a slight bump in public investment due to that defence spending, growth in both remains negative:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"11\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ILmw3/1/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And what that all adds up to is incredibly weak demand:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"77\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/juPmG/1/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"ozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The defence spending helped bump demand up a very little, but with overall demand growing by just 1.2% in the past year, there is pretty much no heat in the domestic economy.</p> <h2>Household spending is keeping us going</h2> <p>In the June quarter, household consumption grew by 0.5% \u2013 down from the 0.65% growth in the March quarter, but enough to keep annual household consumption steady at 2.5%. And that spending was a solid contributor to GDP growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"12\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VQgaT/1/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s here that we see why the financial and insurance industry is the biggest contributor overall to GDP growth. The biggest contributor to the increase in household spending in the June quarter was insurance and other financial services.</p> <p>And over the past year, rents were the biggest driver of our increased spending.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"18\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tVKDU/1/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"height=\"530\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But tobacco certainly was not. The June quarter saw tobacco consumption fall by 12.1% over the past 12 months \u2013 the biggest such fall ever recorded:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"25\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WxKYR/1/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\u201d mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Labour productivity collapses, as do wages </h2> <p>For the fourth straight quarter, the annual growth of nominal unit labour costs \u2013 ie the amount is costs to produce one unit of output \u2013 fell:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"13\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xcbcK/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This is a record and highlights the utter lack of wages growth and inflation in our economy.

This would suggest Australia is becoming less competitive compared to other nations, but no one of any intelligence is really considering that is because of wages growth.</p> <p>But productivity has taken a sharp fall \u2013 mostly because surprisingly there was a solid rise in hours worked in the past quarter. It saw annual productivity growth in the past year hit zero:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"15\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KjKjc/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The five-year annual average growth is also down to 1.6% \u2013 just a touch below the long-term average of 1.7%.
