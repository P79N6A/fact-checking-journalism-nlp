      "bodyText": "Mayors and local councils in England and Wales are to be given new powers to relax Sunday trading laws for high street stores to allow them to compete with large out-of-town shopping centres and online retailers. Under government plans to allow high streets to \u201cgrow and thrive\u201d, councils will be given powers to zone areas where Sunday trading laws could be relaxed. The changes would mean that a local council could declare that shops on a designated high street could be allowed to operate under more relaxed hours while out-of-town shopping centres with fewer local ties could face restrictions. The move will be announced on Wednesday as Brandon Lewis, the communities minister, and Anna Soubry, the business minister, launch a consultation process on liberalising Sunday trading laws. George Osborne announced in his July budget that he would strengthen the hand of mayors by giving them power to set Sunday trading laws in their areas. The government consultation will propose that the current law, which prevents shops that cover more than 3,000 sq ft from opening more than six hours on a Sunday, should be amended. Local councils and mayors would instead be given the power to decide which areas would be free from the restricted trading hours. Ministers expect that local leaders, who are keen to rejuvenate their high streets, would relax trading hours on high streets. This would mean that supermarkets, department stores and gardening centres could open for more than six hours on Sunday. Convenience stores are not subject to the six-hour rule. Lewis said: \u201cThis government is determined to devolve powers previously held in Whitehall to local people. That\u2019s why we want to give local leaders the power to decide whether Sunday trading is right for their area, and to give their retailers the option to stay open for longer. \u201cWe have already taken a range of measures to boost the Great British high street and now we are giving local areas another tool to encourage shoppers to the town centre and get shops to grow and thrive.\u201d The move has been welcomed by retailers who say they are losing out under the restrictive rules which date back to Sunday Trading Act of 1994. In a statement issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government the chief executive of Hillview Garden Centres Ltd Boyd J Douglas-Davies said: \u201cOur customers want to be able to shop on a Sunday at a time that suits them and their lifestyle. \u201cAt both ends of the day we have to deal with frustrated visitors at all of our centres. In the morning the \u2018early-birds\u2019 want to get on with the gardening and later in the day, visitors are forced to leave the centre at a time that feels like it is only mid-afternoon. Sunday is by far and away the busiest day of the week \u2013 this demonstrates that customers want to shop on Sundays.\u201d But James Lowman, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, whose members will now competition from larger stores, rejected the proposed change. Lowman said: \u201cThe current Sunday Trading rules are a popular compromise that provide a small but important advantage for small shops. We know from the Sunday Trading experiment during the Olympic Games that longer opening hours on a Sunday only results in trade being diverted from smaller stores to larger stores, with no overall benefit in sales to the UK economy. We will continue to fight this complicated and harmful plan, and will campaign throughout the year to ensure that our existing Sunday Trading rules are retained.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2015 to clarify that the proposals on Sunday trading apply to England and Wales.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If Warren East, the new chief executive of Rolls-Royce, wants to sleep well at night, he should probably avoid reading one of the two rotating quotations on the front of the website of ValueAct Capital, the San Francisco-based activist hedge fund that recently unveiled a stake in the British aircraft engine maker. It comes from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, and is a warning to any chief executive in charge of an under-performing company. Buffett, in a view evidently endorsed by ValueAct, says: \u201cTrue independence, meaning the willingness to challenge a forceful CEO when something is wrong or foolish,is an enormously valuable trait in a director. It is also rare. The place to look for it is among high-grade people whose interests are in line with those of rank-and-file shareholders \u2013 and in line in a very big way.\u201d Over the past 14 years Jeffrey Ubben, ValueAct\u2019s chief executive and chief investment officer, has been behind some of the world\u2019s largest corporate shakeups where he has rarely been unwilling to challenge a chief executive. He has instigated a full-scale shakeup of food and beverage group Sara Lee, offloading its tea and coffee businesses; he has helped guide financial news and data firm Thomson Corp into the arms of Reuters; and he has been involved in a management shakeup of Microsoft, where the group\u2019s input helped ease the exit of Steve Ballmer. In all, Bloomberg calculates that ValueAct has pressed for changes at 75 companies since Ubben co-founded the firm in 2000. Ubben is known as the quiet activist because of his aversion to publicity. He rarely goes in for the public slanging match that characterised, for example, the prolonged attack on Katherine Garrett-Cox\u2019s management of fund manager Alliance Trust by the activist group Elliott. Ubben\u2019s core investing principles, as outlined in a presentation to the Value Investing conference in New York in 2012, look innocent enough. Under the heading What We Like, ValueAct says: \u201cWe like the company to be business model-focused, not industry-focused, we like disciplined oligopolies; we like fee-based recurring revenue models [very appropriate for Rolls-Royce\u2019s plane engines business], and we like low-risk analysis financial statements and proven management teams.\u201d Equally important is what ValueAct doesn\u2019t like, the presentation continues. It says: \u201cDon\u2019t go looking for problems to fix; be careful of founder-led companies, pick your battles and sometimes it\u2019s easier to sell. Value destruction from poor governance can happen very quickly.\u201d There is no doubt that if the long-term gain doesn\u2019t look like coming. ValueAct will press for change quickly and aggressively unless he decides to sell early instead. Ubben is unafraid to go hostile if he has to, as he did when MSCI, the stock market indexes company, refused to put one of his representatives onto its board. In the past few days, ValueAct has made its presence felt firmly in UK boardrooms, first taking a disclosable 5%-plus stake in Rolls-Royce, and then on Monday emerging as a shareholder in the struggling Smiths Group. Despite its record of creating discord in some situations, where management has been unresponsive, both Rolls-Royce and Smiths Group believe they can have a positive rather than confrontational relationship with their new shareholder. Rolls-Royce\u2019s senior management, who have held \u201cconstructive\u201d conversations with ValueAct over the past few days, are confident that the fund is going to work alongside its new chief executive, one of whose first tasks on coming on board was to deliver a profits warning. According to sources close to the group, both management and ValueAct share the same aim, which is to cut costs in the aerospace business. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be thinking here about what experience can [ValueAct] bring to the corporate turnaround,\u201d said a source close to the group. Smiths is due to welcome in a new chief executive in September and it too is hoping for a harmonious relationship. \u201cWe welcome any input into the future running of the company in the interests of all shareholders,\u201d said a source. In 70% of situations, ValueAct has seen the share price of a company in which it has invested rise sufficiently for it to sell out at a sizeable profit. Shareholders and management at the two UK groups will be hoping for a similar outcome. ValueAct isn\u2019t the only activist investor to have been besieging UK boardrooms recently. Alliance Trust, the Dundee-based fund management group, faced a major battle with one of the most aggressive activist investors in the world, New York hedge fund Elliott Associates, earlier this year. Alliance Trust, whose chief executive is Katherine Garrett-Cox, endured a sapping campaign from Elliott over several weeks, with its investment performance, high costs and excessive executive remuneration, being attacked ahead of a shareholders\u2019 meeting in April. In the end Alliance Trust, which had been targeted by another activist fund in 2011, brokered a deal with Elliott, which is headed by Paul Singer. Sensing possible defeat, Alliance invited two of the fund\u2019s representatives onto its board and agreed that Garrett-Cox has a year to improve on her performance or face being ousted. Many saw the compromise deal as a success for Elliott, given that Garrett-Cox is now on trial in a way that she has never been before. Elliott got a lot further than it did two years earlier in the UK, when it took a 17% stake in transport group National Express and lobbied for its sale or breakup. It retreated a year later, having failed to find support from other investors for the plan. Elsewhere in Europe, the New York-based P Schoenfield Asset Management pressured the French media conglomerate Vivendi to increase a special dividend after an asset sale. Investors in UBS and John Menzies have also sought spin-offs or board changes in recent months. And a few weeks ago, Crystal Amber, a UK-based activist fund, picked up a stake in Pinewood, the film studios group, in a share issue and immediately threatened to launch a renewed attack on its chairman, Lord Grade. Crystal Amber last attacked Lord Grade in 2010, calling for his removal, but was thwarted, eventually selling its 28.3% stake.",

Hayes is the first person to be convicted by a jury of charges relating to the manipulation of Libor, which is used to set borrowing rates on $3ootn (\u00a3190tn) of financial contracts around the world. He was found guilty on eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. The 35-year-old was a former trader at Swiss bank UBS and the US bank Citigroup. Asked about the sentence, Green said: \u201cIt\u2019s part punishment, it\u2019s part deterrent.\u201d When asked whether higher ranking bankers might be pursued, Green told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cWe follow the evidence wherever it takes us, and that might be as high up the organisation as you might choose ... If there is evidence and it is in the public interest we will prosecute someone\u201d. To date 11 others are facing trial for Libor-related charges while one individual has pleaded guilty. The SFO\u2019s investigation into rigging of the global interest rate benchmark is continuing and Green did not give any timescale for when any further charges might be brought. The case is regarded as a relief for Green and the SFO after a series of high-profile problems, including the collapse of an investigation into property developers the Tchenguiz brothers. Vincent Tchenguiz received at least \u00a36m and an apology from the SFO, while Robert Tchenguiz received \u00a31.5m. The Hayes conviction \u201cmust be a considerable relief to both the SFO and its current director,\u201d Robert Rhodes, a London-based trial lawyer told Bloomberg. Had he been acquitted, Rhodes said, \u201cit would have likely raised serious questions about the judgment of those responsible for bringing prosecutions at the SFO\u201d. Mr Justice Cooke, who sentenced Hayes at Southwark crown court, said: \u201cThe conduct involved here is to be marked out as dishonest and wrong and a message sent to the world of banking accordingly. The reputation of Libor is important to the City as a financial sector and the banking institutions of the City.\u201d \u201cProbity and honesty is essential as is trust. The Libor activity of which you played a leading part put all that in jeopardy,\u201d Hayes was told.",

      "bodyText": "The London-listed drug company Shire has made a $30bn (\u00a319bn) hostile takeover bid for the rare-disease specialist Baxalta. Shire\u2019s unsolicited offer \u2013 a direct appeal to shareholders after Baxalta\u2019s board spurned its advances \u2013 comes amid a frenzy of dealmaking in the pharmaceutical industry, as companies race to discover the next generation of profitable medicines, before current pipelines run dry. Shire announced it was ready to pay $45.23 (\u00a328.96) per Baxalta share, a 36% premium on Baxalta\u2019s stock price on Monday. In a bold appeal to Baxalta\u2019s shareholders, Shire claimed that merging the two companies would create \u201cthe global leader in [treating] rare diseases\u201d with combined sales of $20bn by 2020. If Shire\u2019s approach succeeds, the merger would be one of the 20 largest pharma and biotech deals, according to Dealogic. Shire\u2019s play for Baxalta comes after it was nearly taken over itself by Illinois-based rival AbbVie in 2014. The proposed $54bn tie-up between Shire and Abbvie fell apart in the wake of a political backlash in the US against American companies moving headquarters abroad for tax reasons. On the rebound from Abbvie, Shire has gone on an acquisition spree: earlier this year it spent $5.2bn buying rare disease specialist NPS Pharma. On Monday, it announced it was spending $300m on a company developing a treatment for conjunctivitis. Analysts were braced for another deal, but the timing of Tuesday\u2019s bid was a surprise. Shire, best known for drugs to combat hyperactivity, was founded in the UK, is managed in Boston, and headquartered in Dublin, although it generates more than two thirds of sales in the US. Baxalta, which specialises in drugs to treat rare and hard-to-treat diseases of the blood and immune system, and is working on a treatment for sickle cell disease, became an independent company in July, after being spun off by larger US healthcare firm, Baxter International. Baxter retains a 19.5% stake in Baxalta, after the new company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in July. Shire brought in $5.8bn of sales in 2014 and employed 5,000 people, while Baxalta\u2019s sales totalled $6bn with a 16,000-strong workforce. Baxalta would be a major prize for Shire, as it is expected to launch around 20 new products before 2020, with growth forecast at 6-to-8% a year. Shire has been trying to coax Baxalta into merger talks since early July, but its overtures have been rebuffed, prompting Shire to make a direct appeal to shareholders. \u201cOther than a brief meeting on 10 July at which we outlined our proposal and its benefits, your lack of engagement has been surprising,\u201d the Shire chief executive, Flemming Ornskov, wrote in an open letter to his counterpart, Ludwig Hantson at Baxalta. \u201cYou have left us with no choice but to make our proposal known to your shareholders. We believe they deserve an opportunity to consider it.\u201d Baxalta did not respond to a request for comment. Shire said it had not discussed its proposal with Baxter. Shire is proposing an all-stock deal that would give it 63% of the combined group, leaving Baxalta shareholders 37%. Lisa LaMotta, a senior writer at Scrip Intelligence, a specialist news source on the pharmaceutical industry, said such all-share deals were rarely successful, as shareholders preferred a less risky mix of cash and shares. \u201cIt is going to be an uphill battle for Shire if they want to make this come through,\u201d she said. \u201cBaxalta would like to go it alone and prove themselves as a leader in speciality pharmaceuticals.\u201d LaMotta said the two firms had little overlap in their product lines and it was hard to see how Shire could contribute to Baxalta\u2019s growth in any meaningful way. Analysts at stockbroking firm Charles Stanley said the deal made \u201cstrategic sense\u201d, but warned Shire that it may need to improve its offer. \u201cWith Baxalta\u2019s board having been unwilling to engage, there is no guarantee that any transaction will proceed,\u201d said the firm. \u201cIn light of recent M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] activity in the sector we feel that in order to encourage further engagement it is likely that Shire will need to increase the attractiveness of its offer terms.\u201d Deal making in the pharmaceutical industry has reached fever pitch, as companies scramble for new discoveries and seek to reap economies of scale by becoming bigger. In the year to date, deals in the pharmaceutical and biotech sector have totalled $334bn worldwide, according to Dealogic, more than twice as many as the same period last year and five times greater than 2012. Pharma and biotech deals account for 12% of all mergers and acquisition activity this year, compared with 7% in 2014. Shares in FTSE 100 company Shire fell as much as 7.9% after the approach was revealed, but the loss was capped at 4%, at \u00a355 a share. Deal frenzy Since 2014 the pharmaceuticals has been a hive of activity for investment bankers. Here are two of the biggest deals over that period, and the two most controversial failed takeovers. Teva and Allergan Israeli-firm Teva shored up its position as the world\u2019s largest maker of generic (non-branded) medicines, when it bought Allergan\u2019s generic pharmaceuticals business for $40.5bn (\u00a326.1bn) in July 2015. Said to be the largest ever acquisition by an Israeli company, the deal is expected to bring economies of scale for Teva, an important consideration in the hyper-competitive business of making non-branded medicines. Generic drugs are less expensive than branded drugs, but the prices of some generics have soared due to a lack of competition or shortages brought on by manufacturing problems. Allergan and Actavis Dublin-based Allergan sold its generics business, after it agreed to be bought by Actavis, a US firm domiciled in Ireland, in a deal valued at $66bn. The completion of the deal in March 2015 created one of the top ten biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, known under the Allergan brand. Allergan was founded in Los Angeles in 1948 with an anti-allergy nose drop, but its bestseller is the face-freezing filler Botox, which it is seeking to develop for new purposes such as osteoporosis treatments. And two that never happened Pfizer and AstraZeneca It could have been one of the biggest-ever takeovers of a British firm, but collapsed in acrimony. In 2014 the US drugmaker Pfizer failed to secure a proposed $69bn takeover of AstraZeneca, after the British company spurned its American rival\u2019s approach. Scientists, trade unions and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic had lined up to criticise a deal they said was motivated by tax avoidance and cuts to research jobs. AstraZeneca thinks a repeat offer is unlikely: boss Pascal Soriot has said the tightening of US tax rules means US firms are less likely to attempt to takeover their foreign rivals to reduce their tax bills. AbbVie and Shire The US drugs group AbbVie was forced to abandon a proposed $54bn (\u00a334bn) takeover of Britain\u2019s Shire after the US government introduced rules to clamp down on overseas acquisitions driven by tax avoidance. The Chicago-based company had planned to shift its tax base from the US to Britain as part of the deal to cut its corporation tax rate from 22% to 13% by 2016. Shire is listed on the London stock exchange, but has its headquarters in Dublin, where it can take advantage of Ireland\u2019s low corporate tax rates. But almost three-quarters of its sales are made in the US.",

      "bodyText": "The old wisdom said hostile deals don\u2019t work in the world of cutting-edge pharmaceutical research because successful science requires willing partners. In the current bid-a-week biotech bonanza, such niceties can be thrown out of the window, it seems. Shire, the Dublin-based and London-listed outfit, has gone hostile with an all-share $30bn approach to US group Baxalta after being given the cold shoulder by a company spun out of former parent Baxter only last month. \u201cYou have left us with no choice but to make our proposal known to your shareholders,\u201d wrote Flemming Ornskov, Shire\u2019s chief executive and chief-deal-doer, to his Baxalta counterpart. No choice? In today\u2019s biotech world, that is indeed the thinking. The sector is awash with mergers and acquisitions and all are obliged to play. Yet it\u2019s hard to understand what the appeal of Shire/Baxalta is meant to be. Only nine months ago Shire was planning to sell itself to AbbVie of the US, a deal that fell apart when US authorities got tough on tax \u201cinversions\u201d. Shire can still parade its Irish low-tax status (a \u201ccompelling tax profile,\u201d it says) but Baxalta offers minimal overlap on the research front. It operates in the fields of haemophilia, immunology and oncology, none of which are Shire specialities, despite Ornskov\u2019s attempt to paint a happy picture of two companies equally focused on \u201crare diseases.\u201d Shire also argued that a combination could achieve $20bn of revenues by 2020, rather than a projected \u00a318bn independently, but there was minimal detail on how this is meant to happen. Instead, this looks to be a deal conceived by financial engineers. Shire\u2019s low tax rate is main calling-card. It may be enough to bully Baxalta\u2019s management to the negotiating table since Baxter still owns 25% of the stock and presumably separated its biotech division in the hope of seeing some action. Equally, though, one can imagine Baxalta arguing that Shire\u2019s shares, which are \u00a355 today but were \u00a336 after AbbVie departed, are an unreliable currency. Take a step a back from the deal-making, though, and there\u2019s a fundamental question beyond the tax-planning issue that will interest US watchers. Have biotech valuations reached bubble territory? That\u2019s what the doubters argue, and one can understand why. A Shire/Baxalta combo would be worth about $80bn at current share prices. That\u2019s only about $25bn shy of the value of GlaxoSmithKline, a company with greater resources in pharmaceutical research and very solid foundations in vaccines and consumer products. GSK is regarded by the stock market these days as a tired plodder struggling to protect its dividend. Yet, at these valuations, you\u2019d surely back the old giant over the deal-a-minute biotech brigade. Did RBS sale sell the taxpayer short? The best that can be said about the government\u2019s first sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares is that the deed was done reasonably close to the market price. Some 630m shares were sold at 330p, which was 2.25% below Monday\u2019s closing price. For comparison, the first batch of Lloyds Bank Group shares departed at discount of 3.1% in September 2013 and the second collection at 4.6%. But that\u2019s as far as the praise goes. A price of 330p still looks poor when one remembers that 400p was seen in the market as recently as February. Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec, is right to be \u201cperplexed\u201d by the timing. As he says, \u201clast night\u2019s disposal at 330p achieved a new 2015 low and arguably sold the taxpayer short\u201d. Quite. George Osborne announced his intention to start to selling in June and launched the process at the earliest opportunity, within days of the bank\u2019s half-year results last week. Any element of surprise was surrendered. A start had been made at some point, it might be argued, and delay might have been misinterpreted as indecision. OK, but Osborne needs to tread carefully. If he is seen to be seller of RBS at almost any price, the public purse will lose out. Osborne should also stop quoting Mark Carney\u2019s support for the policy of returning RBS to private ownership. It\u2019s nice to know the governor of the Bank of England is on-message but it is the chancellor alone who is responsible for minimising the state\u2019s losses on its RBS shares. Two ways to take away Is that the first sign of indigestion at Just Eat? There was nothing wrong with half-year numbers in which almost every key measure \u2013 orders, revenues and profits \u2013 rose by 50% or more. But the share price fell 3.4%. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re worth an astonishing \u00a32.8bn and you\u2019re rated at 70 times earnings. Investors worry whether even 50% growth will enough. Besides, one of these days, the customers make their own calculation. If takeaway joints are happy to give Just Eat an average commission of \u00a32.36 per order, will they offer a discount to punters who bypass the app?

      "bodyText": "ValueAct, a US hedge fund that agitates for change at companies, has emerged as a shareholder in British engineer Smiths Group, days after revealing it was the biggest investor in Rolls-Royce. The San Francisco-based activist investor is believed to own between 3% and 5% of Smiths. ValueAct informed Smiths in the past six months that it had bought a stake following prolonged talks with company executives. ValueAct is understood to have met Smiths\u2019 management a number of times in the last three or four years as its team analysed the company\u2019s prospects. Since revealing its stake to Smiths, the fund has not set out its intentions but it has asked further detailed questions about the sprawling structure of a company whose products range from medical equipment to electronic components and airport security scanners. A spokesman for Smiths said the company did not comment on non-disclosable shareholdings but added: \u201cWe welcome all shareholders and any active interest a shareholder wishes to take in the business. We always work in the interests of all shareholders.\u201d On Friday, ValueAct announced it held a 5.5% stake in Rolls-Royce after crossing the 5% threshold beyond which investors in public companies must reveal their holdings. The news raised the prospect of the Derby-based engine maker being broken up. ValueAct\u2019s stake in Smiths could also lead to a break-up of the sprawling business, whose products include medical equipment, electronic components and security scanners. ValueAct has not yet decided whether Smiths will be one of the core holdings on which it concentrates its attention but the medical division and J Crane, which makes seals for the energy sector, could be candidates for a sale. Smiths has twice tried to sell its medical unit. The company has been struggling with weak demand, a slump in demand from commodity customers and a cut in government spending. In response it has restructured to trim costs and streamline its operations. Smiths shares closed up 4.4% at \u00a312 on Tuesday. However, according to analysis by Thomson Reuters, the group is trading at a discount of about 17% to its intrinsic value. ValueAct\u2019s decision to invest in two venerable British engineering companies demonstrates the widening horizons of US activist investors. The funds buy stakes in companies and put pressure on management to release cash, sell off divisions or take other actions to increase shareholder returns. ValueAct has joined activist investors Harris Associates and RWC Associates as a major shareholder of Smiths. Between them, the hedge funds hold more than 10% of the shares. ValueAct manages more than $18bn (\u00a311.5bn) for wealthy individual and institutional investors and has shaken up US companies including food group Sara Lee and Microsoft. Unlike high-profile US activists such as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman, ValueAct usually exerts influence behind the scenes instead of using high-pressure public campaigns to get what it wants. Both Rolls-Royce and Smiths are going through management change after disappointing business performance. Rolls-Royce\u2019s chief executive Warren East announced a profit warning last month two days into his tenure. Smiths is waiting for the arrival of Andrew Reynolds Smith from GKN to replace current chief executive Philip Bowman, whose desire to restructure the company was thwarted by the financial crisis. Poor trading at the Smiths\u2019 detection business forced it to issue a profit warning last year.",

    "webTitle": "RBS sell-off: George Osborne defends \u00a31bn loss", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has tried to justify a \u00a31bn loss on the first sale of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland in the face of criticism from politicians and City analysts by saying it was the right thing to do for the British taxpayer. The chancellor sanctioned the first sale of the stake in RBS, announced on Monday night, to cut the taxpayer shareholding from 79% to just below 73%. Slightly more shares than expected were sold after the stock market closed on Monday, crystallising a loss for the taxpayer after \u00a345bn was ploughed into the bank to rescue it amid the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Around 60% of the shares were bought by hedge funds. The \u00a32.1bn of shares were sold at 330p \u2013 below the 337p at which they closed on Monday and less than the average 502p that the taxpayer paid for them. If all the shares were sold at this price, the loss would be \u00a315bn. The bank\u2019s shares ticked higher to close at 339p on Tuesday. UK Financial Investments, the body which looks after the taxpayer stakes in the bailed out banks, is likely to be called to give evidence to the Treasury select committee before the end of the year. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cThe sooner the banks are put back in the private sector the better. RBS is our biggest small business lender and very important to the sustainability of the recovery.\u201d Shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said the sale had been rushed, especially as the bank is awaiting a penalty in the US over the way it sold mortgage bonds before the crisis. That bill could reach as much as \u00a38bn, according to some estimates. \u201cGetting back the taxpayers\u2019 money is not an impossible objective and the chancellor is dismissing this too lightly,\u201d said Leslie. Osborne issued a statement in which he said: \u201cThis is an important first step in returning the bank to private ownership, which is the right thing to do for the taxpayer and for British businesses: it will promote financial stability, lead to a more competitive banking sector, and support the interests of the wider economy. Now is the time for RBS to rebuild itself as a commercial bank, no longer reliant on the state, but serving the working people of Britain.\u201d He did not speak publicly, leaving Treasury minister Harriett Baldwin to try to explain the sale at a time when shares were at a low for the year. Among the reasons she gave was the encouragement of Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, who wrote to the chancellor in June to encourage a sale. John Mann, the Labour MP who sits on the Treasury select committee, said that rather than use the proceeds to pay down the national debt, the government should have used it for public spending, such as infrastructure projects. \u201cIt\u2019s a political move. Osborne is trying to sell off both [RBS and Lloyds Banking Group] before the Tory leadership battle, which he will enter,\u201d said Mann, who also expressed concern about Carney\u2019s intervention in the sales process. Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at the stockbroker Investec, said he was \u201cperplexed\u201d by the timing of the sale: \u201c[Monday] night\u2019s disposal at 330p achieved a new 2015 low and arguably sold the taxpayer short.\u201d \u201cThis will likely be a subject of controversy for a while akin to the Gordon Brown sale of UK gold reserves 15 years ago,\u201d said Brenda Kelly, head analyst, at brokers London Capital Group. The Treasury published letters from UK FI and John Kingman, the second permanent secretary, who both recommended to the chancellor that the sale should begin. Kingman signed the letter in the absence of the most senior civil servant in the Treasury, Nick Macpherson. Bankers working for the government sold 5.4% of the taxpayer stake \u2013 around 630m shares \u2013 rather than the expected 5.2% but could have sold more than double that amount because of the demand from institutions. Just under half were bought by investors in the UK and around 40% by US investors. Osborne had signalled the sale after taking advice from bankers at Rothschild, who have calculated that the loss on RBS can be outweighed by profits on other bailed-out banks, such as the Lloyds Banking Group and Northern Rock. Around three-quarters of the RBS stake is earmarked for sale during the five years of this parliament. Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, said the sale was \u201can important moment\u201d for the bank \u201cand reflects the progress we are making to become a stronger, simpler and fairer bank\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is more work to be done but we\u2019re determined to build a bank that the country can be proud of.\u201d The share sale has taken place just weeks before Sir Philip Hampton, who was appointed chairman at the height of the financial crisis, leaves to chair GlaxoSmithKline. The shares were sold at a 2.3% discount on the market price, a tighter range than the 3.1% discount at which the first tranche of Lloyds Banking Group shares were sold in September 2013. The government\u2019s stake has now fallen from 42% to just under 14% following the latest disposal earlier this week.",

The bank\u2019s shares ticked higher to close at 339p on Tuesday.</p> <p>UK Financial Investments, the body which looks after the taxpayer stakes in the bailed out banks, is likely to be called to give evidence to the Treasury select committee before the end of the year.

RBS is our biggest small business lender and very important to the sustainability of the recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said the sale had been rushed, especially as the bank is awaiting a penalty in the US over the way it sold mortgage bonds before the crisis.

Now is the time for RBS to rebuild itself as a commercial bank, no longer reliant on the state, but serving the working people of Britain.\u201d</p> <p>He did not speak publicly, leaving Treasury minister Harriett Baldwin to try to explain the sale at a time when shares were at a low for the year. Among the reasons she gave was the encouragement of Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, who wrote to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/george-osborne-signals-rbs-sell-off-at-mansion-house-speech\">the chancellor in June</a> to encourage a sale.</p> <p>John Mann, the Labour MP who sits on the Treasury select committee, said that rather than use the proceeds to pay down the national debt, the government should have used it for public spending, such as infrastructure projects. \u201cIt\u2019s a political move. Osborne is trying to sell off both [RBS and Lloyds Banking Group] before the Tory leadership battle, which he will enter,\u201d said Mann, who also expressed concern about Carney\u2019s intervention in the sales process.</p> <p>Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at the stockbroker Investec, said he was \u201cperplexed\u201d by the timing of the sale: \u201c[Monday] night\u2019s disposal at 330p achieved a new 2015 low and arguably sold the taxpayer short.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis will likely be a subject of controversy for a while akin to the Gordon Brown sale of UK gold reserves 15 years ago,\u201d said Brenda Kelly, head analyst, at brokers London Capital Group.</p> <p>The Treasury published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letters-to-the-chancellor-regarding-the-decision-to-execute-an-initial-sale-of-the-governments-shares-in-rbs-group\">letters from UK FI and John Kingman, the second permanent secretary</a>, who both recommended to the chancellor that the sale should begin.

    "webTitle": "Greek bank shares slump again but creditor talks make progress - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Commission has said it believes a deal on a third Greek bailout in time for 20 August, when the country has to pay \u20ac3.2bn to the European Central Bank, is possible. Reuters has received a statement from EC spokeswoman Mina Andreeva in response to earlier comments from Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos that the talks could be concluded this week. According to the news agency, she said: The European Commission is encouraged by the progress made so far. We are moving in the right direction and intense work is continuing. The constructive collaboration with the Greek authorities should allow the negotiations on a new three-year programme to progress rapidly. [If all sides stuck to last month\u2019s summit commitment] agreement is possible in order to allow for a first disbursement under the new ESM programme in time for the payment Greece is due to make on August 20. It is an ambitious yet realistic timetable. On that note of optimism, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A day after the Athens market recorded a 16.2% collapse, the first day it had opened for five weeks, it fell back again but only by 1.22% as some signs of normality returned. Returned everywhere, that is, except to the Greek banking sector, which saw leading banks lose around 30% for the second day running on the prospect of the banks being recapitalised after savers withdrew their cash in waves this year before the introduction of capital controls. But non-financial shares gained ground and Socrates Lazaridis, chief executive of Hellenic Exchanges was quoted by Reuters as saying: The second day of trading showed clear signs we are moving towards a normalisation of the market after the long shutdown. In the rest of Europe it was a more mixed picture, with Spain and Italy seeing the most dramatic moves. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 2.05 points or 0.03% to 6686.57 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.11% to 11, 456.07 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.16% lower at 5112.14 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.02% to 23,473.25 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.02% at 11,150.5 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 10 points or 0.06%. More from Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who said he expected talks with the country\u2019s lenders about a third bailout would be completed in the next few days. After meeting representatives of the IMF, European Commission, ECB and the ESM rescue fund, he said, \u201cEverything will be concluded this week,\u201d reported Reuters. The Athens stock market has closed down 1.22%, the day after its 16.2% record fall as it reopened after a five week halt in trading. Most losses were in the banking sector as worries continued about the need to recapitalise Greece\u2019s financial institutions. After 30% declines on Monday - the largest falls allowed before limits are imposed - Greece\u2019s banks saw similar declines today. Piraeus Bank once again hit the 30% limit, while Eurobank Ergasias, Alpha Bank, National Bank of Greece and Attica Bank all lost between 26% and 29.7%. The talks on privatisation between Greece and its lenders are going better than expected, according to finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos. There were no significant disagreements, he told reporters during a break in the talks. He said (quotes courtesy Reuters): We have submitted a proposal to them. They said they would examine it and come back to us. There were small divergences in views. I don\u2019t think there will be a problem. Discussions have gone better than I expected. The European Council has approved changes to the EFSM financial assistance fund which could help Greece if it decides to ask for another bridging loan as talks on a third bailout continue. That might be needed if no agreement is reached by 20 August when a \u20ac3.2bn payment is due to the European Central Bank. The council ratified an agreement made when the EFSM provided a \u20ac7.16bn loan last month, and is designed to protect non-eurozone members in case of any default. It said: The regulation ensures that financial assistance from the EFSM to a euro area member state will only be granted if legally binding provisions are in place guaranteeing that non-euro area member states are immediately and fully compensated for any liability they may incur as a result of a failure by the beneficiary to repay the financial assistance in accordance with its terms. Greece expects to conclude a bailout deal within two weeks, before it needs to make a \u20ac3.2bn repayment to the European Central Bank Greek banking shares have lost almost 30% for the second day in a row. The Athens stock exchange has slid 2%. Oil and commodity prices have stabilised after their recent sharp falls. Brent crude is up 1.1% at $50 a barrel Chinese stock markets have bounced back after new rules on short-selling came into force The UK government has kicked off the sale of RBS, and George Osborne has defended the \u00a31bn loss to the taxpayer. London-listed drugmaker Shire has made an unsolicited $30bn bid for US group Baxtala, a recent spin-off from Baxter that specialises in haemophilia Wall Street has opened slightly lower. The Dow Jones is down 0.04% at 17589.65 while the Nasdaq has slipped 0.06% to 5112.221. In Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.05% at 11438.28, while France\u2019s CAC has shed 0.35% to 5102.35 and the FTSE 100 index in London is trading 0.1% higher at 6696.14. Returning to Greece, Athens and its lenders agreed on Monday that any pension reforms would not affect individuals who retired before the end of June 2015. On Tuesday, talks shifted onto the recapitalisation of banks and privatisation matters. Talks are taking place between Greece\u2019s finance and economy ministers and their counterparts at the troika/quartet. News of Shire\u2019s approach comes hot on the heels of its acquisition of a small New York-based biotech called Foresight Biotherapeutics, which is working on an eye drop for infectious conjunctivitis, known as pink eye. And in January, Shire bought NPS Pharma, a US firm whose main product aims to alleviate bowel disease. In the corporate world, London-listed drugmaker Shire has swooped on US group Baxalta with a hostile, all-share bid worth $30bn. Baxalta has just been spun off by Baxter and makes treatments for haemophilia. Last summer Shire agreed a $54bn takeover by US drugs group AbbVie, only to see it fall through after the Obama administration clamped down on overseas acquisitions driven by tax avoidance. Together, Shire and Baxalta, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, would have sales of $20bn in 2020. Shire, best known for its hyperactivity drugs but which now specialises in rare diseases, went public with its proposal after Baxalta rebuffed the approach. Shares in Shire fell nearly 5% on the news, making them the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 index. Shire\u2019s chief executive, Flemming Ornskov, wrote to his counterpart, Ludwig Hantson at Baxalta: Other than a brief meeting on 10 July at which we outlined our proposal and its benefits, your lack of engagement has been surprising. You have left us with no choice but to make our proposal known to your shareholders. We believe they deserve an opportunity to consider it.\u201d Professor Charles Goodhart, the respected London School of Economics economist who used to sit on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, has warned that delaying a rate hike because of economic uncertainty would be a great policy error. The downside risks associated with the Chinese stock market slide and the possibility of Greek default are the sort of things policymakers have to look through, Goodhart told Market News International after a Fathom Monetary Policy Forum event. He argued that uncertainty is always present and can always be cited as a reason for delay. One of the great errors of policymaking is the view that \u2018There are a lot of things we don\u2019t know and many of these will become apparent over the next three months, so why not wait three months until you are more certain? The reason why that is an error is because there are lots more things that become uncertain over the next three months, and so the degree of uncertainty is pretty well constant at all times. But noone sees it in that way. Goodhart recalled that when he was on the MPC, from 1997 until 2000, virtually all the BOE quarterly forecasts began by describing the economic situation as uniquely uncertain. He said policymakers had to guard against the fallacious belief that if they just wait a little longer they will be to avoid mistakes because the right course of action will become clearer. He told MNI: It won\u2019t become more obvious. You are just as likely to make mistakes if you wait.\u201d Britain\u2019s tax intake has been below Greece\u2019s, according to OECD figures for 2012. Greece\u2019s tax revenues were 33.5% of GDP, while the UK\u2019s tax revenues made up 32.9% of GDP. Greece\u2019s banking crisis has led to more people turning to plastic, Bloomberg reports. Until last month, the vast majority of Greek pensioners didn\u2019t even have a cash card, which led to the scenes in July of elderly Greeks lining up in despair outside banks, the newswire writes. In a country where cash is king and undeclared transactions still make up about a quarter of the economy, about 1 million debit cards have been issued by banks since the government closed lenders for three weeks and imposed controls on euro bills. Emergency measures that some officials warned might spur the black market are showing signs of doing the opposite. Alpha Bank issued about 220,000 cards in July, more than all of last year, as mainly pensioners realized that they had to access their money at cash machines and elsewhere, said Leonidas Kasoumis, general manager for household lending. Supermarket and gasoline sales paid by debit cards doubled in the wake of controls; usage in the countryside tripled, he said. \u201cCapital controls were a big trigger,\u201d Kasoumis said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for merchants, because cash is limited; it\u2019s good for banks because it reduces operational costs. But the best news is for the economy.\u201d The restrictions on cash were introduced in late June as banks hemorrhaged money and were kept alive by a drip-feed from the European Central Bank. Greeks can withdraw \u20ac420 ($460) a week, though there\u2019s no limit on spending with debit cards provided the transaction is within the country. You can read the full story here. Greece has the lowest number of electronic payments per head in the EU, according to ECB figures. Property prices in Greece are falling at a faster pace: the latest figures from the Bank of Greece show apartment prices dropped 5.6% year-on-year in the second quarter, following a 4.1% fall in the first quarter. Residential property prices have plunged more than 40% since 2008 when Greece slid into a deep recession. Connor Campbell at Spreadex says about the Greek government\u2019s hopes of achieving a bailout deal by 18 August: The likelihood of this being achieved should become clearer in the next few days, as the drafting of an agreement gets underway. The technical talks, which have yielded surprisingly little news beyond last week\u2019s IMF debt relief claim, conclude today, and hopefully will give way to a livening up of this already interminable August (and yes, I\u2019m away we are only four days in).\u201d Europe\u2019s main stock markets are slipping again, with weak oil prices still weighing on energy shares. A warning from German carmaker BMW about slowing sales in China helped drag the Dax in Frankfurt lower. The Athens stock exchange, which lost a record 16% on Monday, its first day of trading in five weeks, has slid a further 1.3%. Its banking index, which comprises the four main lenders, is now down 27.1%, just above the 30% daily loss limit at which trading is halted. National Bank of Greece, Greece\u2019s biggest bank, and Attica Bank are both trading 22% lower. Without the banking stocks, the Athens index would be up on the day. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 0.16% at 6678.02 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.17% at 11424.78 France\u2019s CAC down 0.5% at 5092.72 It has taken Labour a while to respond to the RBS share sale. Chris Leslie MP, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, says: George Osborne\u2019s rush to begin the sell-off of RBS has meant a loss to the taxpayer of as much as \u00a31bn. Taxpayers who bailed out RBS and who have now lost out will want to know why the Government has sold these shares at a discount and while the bank is still awaiting a US settlement for the mis-selling of subprime mortgages. Getting back the taxpayers\u2019 money is not an impossible objective and the Chancellor is dismissing this too lightly.\u201d Athens expects to conclude a bailout deal with international creditors by 18 August, with the drafting of the agreement starting on Wednesday, a government spokeswoman said. Greece faces a key deadline on 20 August when it needs to repay a \u20ac3.2bn bond held by the ECB. Olga Gerovasili told Greece\u2019s Skai TV station: The first phase of negotiations ends today and the second phase starts, which really contains the details of drafting [the deal]. If the terms of the [EU] summit are met, I think that we will have a deal by the 18th of this month.\u201d A degree of calm has returned to financial markets around the world (with the notable exception of the Athens exchange). The price of Brent crude oil is hovering around $50 a barrel, up nearly 1%. Copper has also firmed, rising to $5,240 a tonne after hitting a six-year low of $5,142 on Monday, and Chinese stocks bounced more than 3% after new rules on short-selling came into force. Investors who borrow shares must now wait one day to pay back loans, according to statements from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges issued after the close of trading on Monday. The restrictions are the government\u2019s latest measures to stem the rout, which has led to almost $4 trillion being wiped off China\u2019s stock markets. Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at JK Life Insurance, told Bloomberg News: All the government\u2019s measures including restrictions on short selling are working now. It\u2019s a rebound and given the momentum, it may last for some days.\u201d Spanish unemployment data just out shows that the number of Spaniards out of work has fallen for the sixth month in a row in July. However, nearly all the hiring is in temporary seasonal jobs. Of the 1.8m contracts created in July, more than 93% were temporary. Labour Ministry data showed the overall number of jobless fell by 74,028, or 1.8%, month-on-month to 4.05m people. The latest figures from Nationwide building society show house prices across the UK edged up by 0.4% last month, hitting a new high of \u00a3195,621. Nationwide estimates that homebuyers paid a collective \u00a3275m less in tax in the first six months of the year as a result of changes to stamp duty in December, as my colleague Hilary Osborne reports. After a fall in June which took the annual rate of price inflation to a two-year low, July\u2019s price rise pushed it back to 3.5% \u2013 a level that Nationwide\u2019s chief economist said was close to the historic pace of earnings growth. Robert Gardner said: After moderating over the past 12 months, there are tentative signs that annual house price growth may be stabilising close to the pace of earnings growth, which has historically been around 4%. This would bode well for a sustainable increase in housing market activity, though whether this will be maintained will depend on whether building activity can keep pace with increasing demand.\u201d The FTSE 100 and the German stock market are now in positive territory. The FTSE is up nearly 20 points, or 0.27%, at 6707.69, while the German Dax has edged 5 points higher to 11448.87. France\u2019s CAC is still trading down 0.4% at 5101.99. Producer prices in the eurozone slipped 0.1% in June, according to the EU\u2019s statistics office Eurostat. \u201cCan anyone, apart from some politicians, who thinks that the taxpayer will ever get all its money back for the bailing out of Royal Bank of Scotland, please raise their hand now?\u201d asks Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK. No, I didn\u2019t think so, but this still doesn\u2019t adequately explain the timing behind last night\u2019s announcement that the UK government is paring down its 78% stake in the bailed out lender by 5%, at a time when markets are fairly quiet, and volumes low. Putting to one side the fact that the UK government at the time paid over the odds for the bank, the beginning of the sale process was always going to be politically toxic. Unsurprisingly the main criticism has been that the sale is being done at a significant discount to the purchase price, but realistically that was always going to be the case, given that on an adjusted basis the peak in the share price in 2007 sits at 6,071p. The peak this year currently sits at 414p, which equates in old money to 41.4p before the 10 for 1 stock consolidation we saw in June 2012. The share price is currently sitting just above one year lows and the lows this year at 326p, but since the beginning of 2013 the share price has gone pretty much nowhere, which is a pretty poor return by anyone\u2019s standards, The recent return to profitability may have helped push forward the decision making process after the bank announced a 27% rise in net profits for Q2 last week, but the fact remains that there is billions of taxpayers\u2019 money tied up in a bank not generating a return, that could be put to better use. The banking sector does appear to be showing signs of turning itself around and freed from the dead hand of political control the bank is more likely to show signs of recovery if it is freed from this particular anchor. The bank continues to sell off assets as it continues to cut down its stake in US operation Citizens with another $2bn sale announced last week. Litigation costs are likely to continue to be a drag on profitability for some time to come, with US regulators looking into mortgage mis-selling, but the bank continues to restructure its operations with a more domestic focus and it is likely to be more successful in doing that without the UK government peering over its shoulder. The start of the disposal process may well have fired the starting gun on the re privatisation process, but the process still has a long way to go before being complete. Maybe subsequent stakes may well yield a higher return for taxpayers, but waiting and hoping for a distressed asset to come back into break even territory is no way to generate the best return. Better to free up the capital in the coming weeks and months and put it to better use.\u201d The pound has dipped, falling to $1.5583 after the weaker construction PMI. It also lost ground against the euro, to 70.38p. Traders and analysts are eagerly awaiting Thursday, when the Bank of England releases its quarterly inflation report, its interest rate decision and the minutes of its policy meeting which are expected to reveal the first split in the nine-member committee. Markets expect three members to vote for a rate rise. Stefan Friedhoff, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: This data comes as something of a surprise in a sector in which optimism currently outweighs pessimism. A few months on from the general election, the trading environment is now more settled. Meanwhile, firms have generally adapted well to the new normal. Unrealistic pricing in bidding rounds is largely a thing of the past and the reality of the current situation is being factored into contracts so there is a lower probability of mistakes being replicated. Order books and pipelines look healthy and there is every chance the sun will continue to shine on the sector even after the summer is over.\u201d Housebuilding activity grew at the slowest pace since April, underlining the challenges faces by the government in tackling Britain\u2019s chronic housing shortage. Markit senior economist Tim Moore said: Commercial activity was a key growth driver during July, which partly offset ongoing weakness in civil engineering and softer residential building trends. Survey respondents commented on a variety of growth constraints afflicting the residential building sector, including long lead-in times for new projects, scarce supplier capacity, skill shortages and stretched sub-contractor availability.\u201d Construction firms took on fewer new workers last month, but Markit said hiring is still higher than the historical average. Growth in the UK\u2019s construction industry slowed unexpectedly in July due to weaker housebuilding and civil engineering. The Markit/CIPS Uk construction purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to 57.1 after hitting a four-month high of 58.1 in June. This wrongfooted economists who had expected activity to improve to 58.4. Some non-financial stocks are rising in Athens, such as gaming group OPAP, up 3.5% and energy infrastructure group Metka, up 8.4%. The Athens bourse is now down 3.4%, dragged down by heavy losses in banking shares. Eurobank equities analyst Nick Koskoletos says: Following yesterday\u2019s massive sell-off, there was significant dislocation in share valuations which triggered investors\u2019 interest in high-quality, non-financial stocks. The recent fall in commodity prices is likely to be short-lived, believe economists at Capital Economics. \u201cWe do not expect the renewed falls in commodity prices on Monday to be the beginning of another major leg down in natural resources markets,\u201d they write. We would caution against getting too carried away by these recent developments. For a start, the Chinese PMIs were probably dragged down by temporary factors. China\u2019s major manufacturing hubs were affected by bad weather last month, while the collapse in the stock markets on the mainland probably damaged business sentiment. Note too that the official PMI was not as weak, suggesting that Markit\u2019s measure may have overdone the decline. What\u2019s more, there are already signs that the policy support implemented in recent months has begun to boost economic activity. And the authorities still have plenty more ammunition at their disposal to prevent conditions from worsening any further. The upshot is that most of the bad news from China is probably already priced into the market, suggesting that commodities are unlikely to fall much lower. We suspect that some recovery in demand will actually lift prices in the months ahead. The Footsie is now down 0.5% at 6655.09. Connor Campbell, financials analyst at Spreadex, says: Tuesday brings with it the quietest day in a week otherwise full of data, leaving the FTSE extra susceptible to any downturn in the commodity sector. So far Brent Crude and copper are tentatively in the green as they take back some of Monday\u2019s losses; this still leaves the former teetering just above $50 per barrel whilst the latter is only marginally higher than yesterday\u2019s lows. Lagging behind the commodity stocks themselves are the FTSE\u2019s weighty oil and mining firms, with BP and Shell especially looking shaky. The continuation of this commodity drag has meant the UK index underwent another lifeless open, as it continues its struggle to substantially break 6700. An expected improvement in the construction PMI is unlikely to help the FTSE out as investors focus on the commodity issues, but a strong figure could give a boost to the pound. In Athens, the main banking stocks are getting battered again: they\u2019ve lost more than 29% in early trading, close to the 30% daily limit for losses. The Greek banks index has lost 29.46%. The stock market as a whole opened 4.5% lower and is now trading 0.2% higher. Attica Bank -24.49% National Bank of Greece -29.05% Alpha Bank 29.65% Eurobank -29.7% Piraeus Bank -30% In sharp contrast to Greece, Ireland\u2019s manufacturing sector powered ahead last month. The Investec PMI showed growth of output, new orders and employment all picked up, but factory gate prices fell for the second month running. Brent crude briefly crept above $50 a barrel before dipping below again. In London, Smiths Group is the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 index after reports that the activist hedge fund ValueAct has become a shareholder in the company, which makes a range of products including airport scanners and medical devices. The news comes just days after the San Francisco-based hedge fund revealed it had become the largest investor in the aerospace group Rolls-Royce, one of Britain\u2019s biggest manufacturers. The Financial Times reported (\u00a3) that ValueAct has been building a stake in Smiths since the company appointed a new chief executive and sparked hopes for a strategic review of the sprawling business. Smiths shares are up more than 7% at \u00a312.32. Asian shares recovered somewhat on Tuesday, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei recouping earlier losses and ending the day 0.1% lower. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 3.7% while the CSI 300 index added 3.1%. Oil prices have also firmed, with Brent crude trading 0.85% higher at $49.94 a barrel while New York crude is 1% ahead at $45.68. In Europe, stock markets have opened lower, however: Germany\u2019s Dax down nearly 40 points, or 0.35% at 11404.01 France\u2019s CAC down 24 points, or 0.47%, at 5096.28 UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 34 points, or 0.5%, at 6654.21 French bank Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and German carmaker BMW are among the worst performers following second-quarter results while energy stocks are being dragged lower by weak oil prices. BMW warned about the impact of China\u2019s economic slowdown on its business. Here\u2019s our full story on RBS... and a handy timeline: Royal Bank of Scotland: from bailout to sell-off. And you can find out more about the background here: RBS sale: Fred Goodwin, the \u00a345bn bailout and years of losses. Chris Leslie, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, responded to the \u201cfire sale\u201d of RBS shares, on Monday: RBS had to be bailed out urgently, but it doesn\u2019t have to be sold off at the same speed. Labour has always supported the eventual return of RBS to the private sector but taxpayers who bailed out the bank will want their money back and will be suspicious of any fire sale. The Chancellor needs to justify his haste in selling off a chunk of RBS while the bank is still awaiting a US settlement for the mis-selling of sub-prime mortgages. Two years ago George Osborne said he would only countenance a sale of RBS when \u2018the bank is fully able to support our economy and when we get good value\u2019. Neither of these tests has yet been passed.\u201d George Osborne has kicked off the first sale of shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland since it was rescued in 2008, at a loss of \u00a31bn to the taxpayer, our City editor Jill Treanor reports. The government has sold \u00a32.1bn of RBS shares (a 5.4% stake) at 330p a share, a 2% discount. The chancellor faced criticism from Labour politicians and trade union officials that he should have waited for the bank to achieve more deep-rooted reform before embarking on a major privatisation. But George Osborne said it was the right thing to do for the British taxpayer. The chancellor sanctioned the first sale of the stake in RBS, which was announced on Monday night, in a move which cuts the taxpayer shareholding from 79% to just below 73%. Slightly more shares than expected were sold to major City investors after the stock market closed on Monday, crystallising a loss for the taxpayer after \u00a345bn was ploughed into the bank to rescue it amid the financial crisis in 2008-2009. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said: I\u2019m pleased the government has started to sell down its stake. It\u2019s an important moment and reflects the progress we are making to become a stronger, simpler and fairer bank. There is more work to be done but we\u2019re determined to build a bank the country can be proud of.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. European stock markets held up surprisingly well on Monday despite weaker Chinese data which put more pressure on commodities and the sharp sell-off on the Greek stock market when it reopened after a five-week shutdown . The Athens exchange plunged 23% before closing 16% lower, its worst performance since records began in 1985. Banking shares got hammered and closed down 30%. Sentiment was also hit by a slump in the Greek manufacturing PMI survey to a record low. Greek banks could come under further pressure, as Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: The severity of the decline suggests that any bailout is likely to come in well above the \u20ac86bn numbers being bandied about, which in turn is likely to make any discussions about debt relief even more contentious. Any increase in tensions as we get closer to the \u20ac3.2bn ECB repayment date on 20 August is likely to see Greek banks come under further pressure in the coming days. Weak Chinese manufacturing numbers triggered a sell-off in Asian stock markets and sent commodities lower on Monday. Brent crude dropped below $50 a barrel for the first time since January. Commodity prices have been suffering because China is the world\u2019s biggest consumer. European stock markets are set to open lower. FTSE100 is expected to open 23 points lower at 6,665 DAX is expected to open 38 points lower at 11,405 CAC40 is expected to open 18 points lower at 5,102 Hewson adds: The pound will be in focus once again today with the release of the latest construction PMI data for July, in the wake of yesterday\u2019s rebound in the manufacturing PMI from a two year low. Expectations are for the construction sector to improve from 58.1 to 58.6, in the process shifting the focus to this week\u2019s latest Thursday trifecta of Bank of England rate meeting, minutes and inflation report.",

Emergency measures that some officials warned might spur the black market are showing signs of doing the opposite.</p> <p>Alpha Bank issued about 220,000 cards in July, more than all of last year, as mainly pensioners realized that they had to access their money at cash machines and elsewhere, said Leonidas Kasoumis, general manager for household lending. Supermarket and gasoline sales paid by debit cards doubled in the wake of controls; usage in the countryside tripled, he said.</p> <p>\u201cCapital controls were a big trigger,\u201d Kasoumis said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for merchants, because cash is limited; it\u2019s good for banks because it reduces operational costs. But the best news is for the economy.\u201d</p> <p>The restrictions on cash were introduced in late June as banks hemorrhaged money and were kept alive by a drip-feed from the European Central Bank.

Litigation costs are likely to continue to be a drag on profitability for some time to come, with US regulators looking into mortgage mis-selling, but the bank continues to restructure its operations with a more domestic focus and it is likely to be more successful in doing that without the UK government peering over its shoulder. </p> <p>The start of the disposal process may well have fired the starting gun on the re privatisation process, but the process still has a long way to go before being complete.</p> <p>Maybe subsequent stakes may well yield a higher return for taxpayers, but waiting and hoping for a distressed asset to come back into break even territory is no way to generate the best return. </p> <p>Better to free up the capital in the coming weeks and months and put it to better use.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55c07d00e4b0412eb1bfe05f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-04T08:51:39.485Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has dipped, falling to $1.5583 after the weaker construction PMI.

Sentiment was also hit by a slump in the Greek manufacturing PMI survey to a record low.</p> <p>Greek banks could come under further pressure, as Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The severity of the decline suggests that <strong>any bailout is likely to come in well above the \u20ac86bn numbers being bandied about</strong>, which in turn is likely to make any discussions about debt relief even more contentious. Any increase in tensions as we get closer to the \u20ac3.2bn ECB repayment date on 20 August is likely to see Greek banks come under further pressure in the coming days.</p> </blockquote> <p>Weak Chinese manufacturing numbers triggered a sell-off in Asian stock markets and sent commodities lower on Monday. Brent crude dropped below $50 a barrel for the first time since January. Commodity prices have been suffering because China is the world\u2019s biggest consumer.<br></p> <p>European stock markets are set to open lower.</p> <p><strong>FTSE100</strong> is expected to open 23 points lower at 6,665</p> <p><strong>DAX</strong> is expected to open 38 points lower at 11,405</p> <p><strong>CAC40</strong> is expected to open 18 points lower at 5,102</p> <p>Hewson adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound will be in focus once again today with the release of the latest construction PMI data for July, in the wake of yesterday\u2019s rebound in the manufacturing PMI from a two year low.</p> <p>Expectations are for the construction sector to improve from 58.1 to 58.6, in the process shifting the focus to this week\u2019s latest Thursday trifecta of Bank of England rate meeting, minutes and inflation report. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-04T07:14:14.938Z\">at 8.14am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Adnams, the 143-year-old Suffolk brewer, is being forced to respond to the growing challenge of craft ales and independent brewers as the beer market becomes increasingly fickle. The company said sales of its biggest selling beer, Southwold bitter, fell during the first half of this year as drinkers tried more exotic brews. Adnams said it had responded by producing a greater variety of beers, sometimes for short periods of time. It also produces upmarket gin and vodka at a distillery opened in 2010 to tap people willing to pay more for distinctive spirits. Independent brewing has boomed as drinkers, often in their 20s, have rejected gassy, bland lagers in favour of characterful beers made with a widening array of ingredients. There are about 1,500 breweries in the UK, a number not seen since the end of the second world war. Adnams\u2019 main nod to the craft ale movement is Ghost Ship, a 4.5% citrussy pale ale. Others include Blackshore Stout and a dry hopped keg lager. It produces more beers for shorter periods of time to keep up interest and meet demand for new products. Jonathan Adnams, the company\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cOur newer beers have grown well in a fickle market and our spirits have continued their strong growth. The more traditional cask beer market is still doing quite well but all the fizz and buzz that people are writing about is around the craft sector. \u201cGhost Ship is an example of a beer that fits nicely between the more traditional draft beer and people looking for something more exciting. We have 35 different beers a year now whereas 20 years ago the number would have been nine or 10. That\u2019s an indication of the diversity in the marketplace. \u201cCustomers are looking to try new things which means they may move on from you quite quickly. It\u2019s quite a fast moving market and we have to respond to that.\u201d The company, based in Southwold, said its beer sales fell 5% in the first six months of this year \u2013 a bigger decline than the 3.6% for the wider market. Operating profit increased 12% to \u00a3962,000, helped by an increase in property sale profits to \u00a3407,000 from \u00a3107,000 a year earlier. Adnams, the great-great grandson of the brewer\u2019s co-founder, said the fall in Adnams\u2019 beer sales was due to its increased reliance on big pub groups such as JD Wetherspoon, whose orders fluctuate between reporting periods. Beer sales rose 18% in the same period a year ago. \u201cThey have big volumes but we don\u2019t always get a slot in every beer festival they do,\u201d he said.",

It also produces upmarket gin and vodka at a distillery opened in 2010 to tap people willing to pay more for distinctive spirits.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/21/trouble-brewing-how-craft-beer-fomented-a-battle-for-the-soul-of-booze\">Independent brewing has boomed</a> as drinkers, often in their 20s, have rejected gassy, bland lagers in favour of characterful beers made with a widening array of ingredients. There are about 1,500 breweries in the UK, a number not seen since the end of the second world war.</p> <p>Adnams\u2019 main nod to the craft ale movement is Ghost Ship, a 4.5% citrussy pale ale. Others include Blackshore Stout and a dry hopped keg lager. It produces more beers for shorter periods of time to keep up interest and meet demand for new products.</p> <p>Jonathan Adnams, the company\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cOur newer beers have grown well in a fickle market and our spirits have continued their strong growth. The more traditional cask beer market is still doing quite well but all the fizz and buzz that people are writing about is around the craft sector.</p> <p>\u201cGhost Ship is an example of a beer that fits nicely between the more traditional draft beer and people looking for something more exciting. We have 35 different beers a year now whereas 20 years ago the number would have been nine or 10. That\u2019s an indication of the diversity in the marketplace.</p> <p>\u201cCustomers are looking to try new things which means they may move on from you quite quickly. It\u2019s quite a fast moving market and we have to respond to that.\u201d</p> <p>The company, based in Southwold, said its beer sales fell 5% in the first six months of this year \u2013 a bigger decline than the 3.6% for the wider market. Operating profit increased 12% to \u00a3962,000, helped by an increase in property sale profits to \u00a3407,000 from \u00a3107,000 a year earlier.</p> <p>Adnams, the great-great grandson of the brewer\u2019s co-founder, said the fall in Adnams\u2019 beer sales was due to its increased reliance on big pub groups such as JD Wetherspoon, whose orders fluctuate between reporting periods. Beer sales rose 18% in the same period a year ago.</p> <p>\u201cThey have big volumes but we don\u2019t always get a slot in every beer festival they do,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Here deal represents Audi, BMW and Daimler\u2019s fightback against a tech sector encroaching on carmaker territory. Three German carmakers have put their rivalries aside by teaming up to acquire a \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32bn) mapping business from Nokia, in a bid to outsmart tech groups in the race to cash in on the driverless car revolution. However, the German trio are taking on businesses who possess considerable cash resources and who are not encumbered by the need to develop conventional vehicles at the same time. Google Google has long been a pioneer in the race towards driverless motoring, recently setting up its own car company, Google Auto LLC. The company is headed by Chris Urmson, project lead for Google\u2019s self-driving cars. The company is registered with national and international organisations as a passenger vehicle manufacturer, and was licensed last year as a carmaker in California. Documents obtained by the Guardian under a Public Records Act request in California show that Google Auto was formed as a limited liability company in late 2011. Initially, Google used it to modify and test the fleet of driverless Lexus SUVs that succeeded the company\u2019s first self-driving Prius saloons. Google Auto is named as the manufacturer of all 23 autonomous Lexus cars registered with California\u2019s department of motor vehicles, including all the vehicles involved in a recent spate of minor accidents in and around Google\u2019s home town of Mountain View. Apple The consumer electronics giant is apparently working on an electric car or vehicle-related project that could be released by 2020. The Cupertino, California-based company behind the iPhone and Mac computer, was reported earlier this year to have been on a recruitment spree, attracting key members of car manufacturers\u2019 electric and new vehicle system teams. There have also been reports of a visit by senior Apple executives to a BMW plant in Leipzig, Germany, fuelling rumours that the two groups might be about to announce a formal link-up to possibly develop futuristic cars. A report from Bloomberg indicates that Apple is targeting an electric car for release as early as 2020. Vehicles typically take seven years to develop. Tesla Perhaps the closest to being ready for going driverless is Tesla Motors, whose chief executive, tech pioneer Elon Musk, unveiled a software update last week that would allow its cars to autosteer and park. Musk said, in a series of tweets, that his company was \u201calmost ready to release highway autosteer and parallel autopark software update\u201d, a sign that the technology was nearing a state of readiness. He conceded, however, that the software still had work to do before it could decipher road markings at dusk. Tesla has for months been testing its driverless software prototypes on highways north of San Francisco.",

      "bodyText": "The focus will undoubtedly be about the dollar. Stevens move away from jawboning the currency downwards has sent the market into a mini-frenzy. After months of steady falls, the dollar has jumped more than 1%. Was US72c the bottom? We\u2019ll find out in the coming months. But thanks for joining us today. RBA keeps the cash rate at 2%. Governor Glenn Stevens seems a little more upbeat The dollar spikes nearly US1c in response \u201cAccommodative\u201d policy (ie low rates) to continue Conclusion among market watchers seems to be that RBA is more upbeat and the dollar has responded by rising strongly since 2.30pm. The local unit is now at US73.51c \u2013 a gain of nearly one cent on the last 24 hours trading. And this from The Kouk, who thinks the next move might be up... The governor\u2019s statement kept up the cut and past right through to the conclusion. A month ago this was the conclusion to the statement: The Board today judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting. Information on economic and financial conditions to be received over the period ahead will inform the Board\u2019s assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target. Here is this month\u2019s conclusion, with the difference in bold: The Board today judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting. Further information on economic and financial conditions to be received over the period ahead will inform the Board\u2019s ongoing assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target. \u201cFurther\u201d and \u201congoing\u201d. Reading the governor\u2019s statement for signs does get a bit like using tea leaves to forecast future events, but even the most ambitious fortune teller would struggle to find meaning from the addition of just those two words! One change was on the issue of the exchange rate. Last month it noted that it was \u201clikely and necessary\u201d for the dollar to fall but this month simply said it was \u201cadjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices\u201d. In the few minutes since the announcement, the value of the dollar has risen from around US$0.72990 to US$0.7330 - a rise of 0.5%, which isn\u2019t a great deal, and pretty much the usual after such announcements. And more on that housing market issue ... It notes that: Low interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending. Credit is recording moderate growth overall, with stronger borrowing by businesses and growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady over recent months. Its concerns about a housing bubble \u2013 such as they are \u2013 remain the same as they were last month, with the bank noting that \u201cdwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities\u201d. It also again notes that: The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates. So nothing new on the RBA front. On the international front the RBA notes that: The Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing its policy rate later this year, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease policy. Hence, global financial conditions remain very accommodative. Despite fluctuations in markets associated with the respective developments in China and Greece, long-term borrowing rates for most sovereigns and creditworthy private borrowers remain remarkably low. Rather wonderfully that is exactly word for word what it said last month on the same issue. Never let it be said that the RBA lets good sentences go to waste. Each statement by the RBA generally involves a fair degree of cut and paste, and this one is almost verbatim the same as last month\u2019s. But there is a slight difference in the paragraph on the domestic economy. This month it added in an new part when it noted that: While the rate of growth has been somewhat below longer-term averages, it has been associated with somewhat stronger growth of employment and a steady rate of unemployment over the past year. This is a nod to the speech by Glenn Stevens which suggests we are in a period where lower GDP growth is not leading to slower employment growth. And the usual on the housing market... \u201cThe Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market.\u201d \u201cLow interest rates are acting to support borrowing and spending.\u201d \u201cPolicy must be accommodative.\u201d Here\u2019s the statement in full. Rates on hold at 2%. But this brings with it a couple questions: 1. Is growth below average and thus the RBA should keep thinking about cutting rates? 2. If this is the new average, then does that mean the RBA is happy that monetary policy has done all it can, and there is no need to cut rates any further? It will be interesting to see if the RBA announcement addresses any of these aspects. We wait and see in a couple of minutes ... The new normal? A big question posed by the governor of the RBA, Glenn Stevens, last month was what is \u201cthe new normal\u201d? We are currently experiencing abnormally low inflation and wages growth, our economy is growing below average, and yet employment is not falling as would be expected. Stevens suggested this all may be due to statistical flubs which will be corrected in due course (always a possibility), that maybe our population growth has not been as strong as previously thought and thus we\u2019re not getting the usual benefit from such growth. Or maybe, it is that what was once normal GDP growth of 3.2% is now above average. Certainly the slow GDP per capita growth over the past 7 years would suggest things are not going along as usual: Falls in our exchange rate generally lead to rises in the cost of our imports. For now that really hasn\u2019t been that big of a deal, because there was also a big fall in the price of oil (which alas, has now stopped falling and is back rising). The rise in the price of goods and services which has a price determined on the world market (such as petrol and other imported goods) fell 0.3% in the past year: The increase in the price of \u201cnon-tradable\u201d goods and services \u2013 ie those which sees the price largely determined here in Australia, such as education, health costs, (some) food rose just 2.6%. This is well down on historical averages. And certainly nothing there would have the RBA worried about inflation getting out of control. Indeed, given the weak inflation and weak wages growth figures, the RBA probably wouldn\u2019t mind a bit more inflation. The Treasurer certainly would as stronger inflation and wage growth would see better tax revenue. Two reasons for the low dollar. Firstly iron ore and coal prices plummeted. When a third of a country\u2019s exports fall, the value of that country\u2019s currency will usually fall with it Secondly, the other big factor has been the improvement in the US economy and significantly the end of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s policy of quantitative easing \u2013 where it bought a slew of US treasury bonds (around $3.5 trillion all up). That policy devalued the worth of the US dollar. Now that it has finished, the value has improved. Since October last year the US dollar has increased in value by about 10% compared to its major trading partners. Coupled with this is that after nearly seven years, both the Fed and Bank of England are looking like raising their official interest rates. The last time the Fed cut was in December 2008 \u2013 a time so long ago Malcolm Turnbull had only just got used to being called \u201copposition leader\u201d, the most popular movie in Australia was the first Twilight film and Lady Gaga was the newest music sensation with Poker Face. In the time since the Fed last changed interest rates, the RBA has changed them 19 times! But the upshot is, if the Fed raises rates, it will have essentially the same (if not more) impact on the value of our currency as would the RBA cutting rates. So there will be little need for the RBA to worry about that when it makes up its mind in the next half hour. The dollar One reason given in the past for the need for an interest rate cut has been to get the value of our dollar down. Such a worry is well in the past now. Our dollar is worth around US$0.73 \u2013 roughly on or just a touch below the 30 year average, and 22% down on where it was in September last year: The slowing of the building approvals is happening pretty much across the country. Of the states, only Tasmania appears to be showing signs of continued vigour. The impact of the new Apra speed limits has also seen banks move to try to dampen the investor market themselves. All four of the big banks have in the past month raised the interest rates for investor housing loans by around 27 to 29 basis points. This is exactly would you would expect to see occur with such \u201cmacroprudential tools\u201d. Essentially what they hope will occur is that with a limit on investor lending, it takes some of the heat out of the property market, and allows the RBA to keep rates lower for longer. Certainly the drop in non-housing approvals is a pretty obvious result. A couple of months ago it looked like for the first time non-housing approvals would be greater than housing approvals. Now that landmark looks to be put off for a bit longer: The fall in approvals of apartments \u2013 which are basically investor led construction (you don\u2019t have many owner occupiers building an apartment block!) \u2013 comes off the back of some interesting findings regarding investor activity. Figures which showed a jump in the numbers of properties being listed for sale in Sydney and Melbourne could be a sign that investors are rushing to get out of the market. Any changes in investor habits is largely being driven by moves by the Apra to limit such lending. Last year it introduced \u201cspeed limits\u201d wherein banks should not have credit growth for investor property loans going over 10%. As Martin Farrer reported last week \u201cthe Commonwealth (10.2%), NAB (14%) and ANZ (12%) all topped the cap while Westpac, at 9.9%, just scraped below the limit\u201d. The most recent figures from the RBA show overall housing investor credit growing at 10.7% well in excess of that for owner-occupiers at 5.5% Last week also saw the release of the important building approvals data. The RBA knows its most direct impact on the economy through cutting or raising interest rates comes via the building industry \u2013 specifically the residential market. The latest figures showed a sharp drop in building approvals \u2013 falling 8.2% in seasonally adjusted terms, and 1.2% in trend terms. The drop was driven by a large fall in the number of approvals of non-house dwellings \u2013 ie flats and apartments. As I noted a couple weeks ago, there is a large amount of such buildings which have been approved but on which building has yet to begin. This has led some to worry that there is a glut of apartment buildings coming down the construction tube. The number of private sector non-house dwellings approved fell 20.8% in June. And while again those figures do bounce around a lot, the trend fall of 2.4% suggests it is not a flash in the pan occurrence: Overall private sector building approvals rose 14.5% in the past year, but this also is down on previous months and suggests a peak has occurred. Retail sales up Any hopes of a cut in rates were probably smashed with the release of the retail trade figures today. They showed total turnover increased 0.7% in June in seasonally adjusted terms. That\u2019s a pretty sizeable jump, but the seasonally adjusted figures do get a bit excitable. The trend growth of 0.3% is still nice and solid and produced a healthy annual increase of 4.7%: This month also saw the quarterly release of volume of retail sales. It showed as well solid results, with total volume of sales up 3.3% in the past year, with the best results in the household goods retailing , which was up 10.5%: That category includes electrical, computer and other assorted goods, and it certainly saw a bounce due to the release of the iphone 6 last year. The market expectations of interest rates haven\u2019t changed a great deal in the past month. But if anything the market now remains more sure that another rate cut will occur \u2013 it\u2019s just that they expect it will come later than it previously expected. A month ago the market was expecting another rate cut anytime from the start of next year on. Now that expectation has been pushed out to April 2016. Of course predictions this far out have a habit of being out by a large amount. It\u2019s worth remembering that in April this year, the market was expecting rates by now to already have been cut to 1.75%. So being wrong four months out suggests we don\u2019t place too much faith in expectations for what will occur next year. Good afternoon. Greg Jericho here. Today most economists agree with the market pricing that suggests there is only a small chance of a rate cut. The market currently is pricing in just a 9% chance of a rate cut. The decision comes after the release of the latest inflation and cost of living data late last month. The data showed that inflation remains very weak at just 1.5%, while the RBA\u2019s \u201ccore inflation\u201d measure of just 2.2% is well in the bottom half of its 2% to 3% range. But low inflation does not necessarily mean the RBA is going to pull the trigger and cut rates. The retail trade data out today shows solid growth and employment as well is holding up better than expected. Last month the RBA governor, Glenn Stevens gave an interesting speech in which he suggested that maybe we are in a period where trend economic growth will be lower than it used to be. Thus while there seems little chance of a rate cut today, we will be looking for signs that the RBA is satisfied with the lower than usual level of growth or whether it still believes there is scope for the bank to give the economy another push later on in the year. Before Greg Jericho takes us through the various factors governing today\u2019s decision \u2013 which include a look at those retail sales figures and its positive impact on the Australian dollar today, now at US72.91c \u2013 there\u2019s been an interesting note from credit agency Moody\u2019s about the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority\u2019s decision to force banks to hold more capital against their huge mortgage books. Moody\u2019s says the decision and fallout which we reported on last week will help guard against the risks facing the banks in the property market. Francesco Mirenzi, senior analyst, says: The additional capital that will be required to be held against residential mortgages will better align the banks\u2019 capital positions with the growing tail risks arising from their residential mortgage exposures during a period of high investor demand and an associated rapid acceleration in house prices in Sydney and Melbourne. The big four banks \u2013 Commonwealth, ANZ, Westpac and NAB \u2013 have all raised borrowing rates for investors on the back of the decision as they seek to pass on the cost of the tighter regulations. And Moody\u2019s notes that there could be more to come. Moody\u2019s expects further increases in capital requirements to be announced over the next 12 months, a result in turn of ongoing changes to the global capital adequacy framework for banks, as driven by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Good afternoon and welcome to the live blog on the RBA board\u2019s latest monthly meeting. The main focus is of course its decision on the cash rate at 2.30 but before then we\u2019ll set the scene. Most economists expect the board to keep the cash rate on hold at the historic low of 2% but despite two cuts already this year, there\u2019s still a case for reducing borrowing costs. Equally, strong retail sales for June suggest the economy is powering up so maybe the bias will start towards raising rates. Seems unlikely but it\u2019s going to a fascinating period for the Australian economy.",

The market currently is pricing in just a<a href=\"http://www.asx.com.au/prices/targetratetracker.htm\"> 9% chance of a rate cut</a>.</p> <p>The decision comes after the release of the latest inflation and cost of living data late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/grogonomics/2015/jul/24/australias-fluctuating-cost-of-living-offers-reserve-bank-a-rates-riddle\">last month</a>.

The retail trade data out today shows solid growth and employment as well is holding up better than expected.</p> <p>Last month the RBA governor, Glenn Stevens gave<a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-gov-2015-07-22.html\"> an interesting speech</a> in which he suggested that maybe we are in a period where trend economic growth will be lower than it used to be.</p> <p>Thus while there seems little chance of a rate cut today, we will be looking for signs that the RBA is satisfied with the lower than usual level of growth or whether it still believes there is scope for the bank to give the economy another push later on in the year.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55c02c3fe4b0412eb1bfdfdd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-04T03:19:29.105Z\">4.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics\">Greg Jericho</a> takes us through the various factors governing today\u2019s decision \u2013 which include a look at those retail sales figures and its positive impact on the <strong>Australian dollar today, now at US72.91c</strong> \u2013 there\u2019s been an interesting note from <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Higher-capital-for-residential-mortgages-are-credit-positive-for--PR_330485\">credit agency Moody\u2019s </a>about the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority\u2019s decision to force banks to hold more capital against their huge mortgage books.</p> <p>Moody\u2019s says the decision and fallout <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/31/housing-investors-face-crackdown-as-banks-exceed-regulators-lending-limit\">which we reported on last week </a>will help guard against the risks facing the banks in the property market. Francesco Mirenzi, senior analyst, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The additional capital that will be required to be held against residential mortgages will better align the banks\u2019 capital positions with the growing tail risks arising from their residential mortgage exposures during a period of high investor demand and an associated rapid acceleration in house prices in Sydney and Melbourne.</p> </blockquote> <p>The big four banks \u2013 Commonwealth, ANZ, Westpac and NAB \u2013 have all raised borrowing rates for investors on the back of the decision as they seek to pass on the cost of the tighter regulations. </p> <p>And Moody\u2019s notes that there could be more to come.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Moody\u2019s expects further increases in capital requirements to be announced over the next 12 months, a result in turn of ongoing changes to the global capital adequacy framework for banks, as driven by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/basel-iii\">Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.</a></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55c0284ae4b06ef520c3275a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-04T03:06:19.054Z\">4.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good afternoon and welcome to the live blog on the <strong>RBA board\u2019s latest monthly meeting.</strong> The main focus is of course its decision on the cash rate at 2.30 but before then we\u2019ll set the scene.</p> <p>Most economists expect the board to keep the cash rate on hold at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/05/reserve-bank-of-australia-cuts-rates-to-historic-new-low-of-2\">historic low </a>of 2% but despite two cuts already this year, there\u2019s still a case for reducing borrowing costs.
