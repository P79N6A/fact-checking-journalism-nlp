      "bodyText": "Britons who book their own holidays online are to be given the same protection if the firms they use go bust as consumers who buy package deals through a travel operator. From 2018, new legislation will mean people using websites to book flights and hotels separately do not run the risk of being stranded abroad or losing their money. Until now, the protection for holidaymakers offered by the government-backed Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence (Atol) has failed to reflect the huge changes in the travel industry, as millions more people opt to save money by booking online rather than visiting a high street travel agent. The Association of British Travel Agents holiday habits report 2016 found more than three-quarters of UK consumers now booked their vacation online. \u201cAtol was set up for good reason \u2013 we go on holiday to relax, not worry about \u2018what ifs\u2019,\u201d said the transport minister John Hayes. \u201cBut people who buy their flights and hotels separately sometimes miss out on the protection, and peace of mind, that comes with this protection. This change will make the law fit for the modern age \u2013 and better able to adapt to any future advances in the technology that people use to book their getaway.\u201d Since 1973, Atol has protected people booking package holidays in the event that the firm goes bust, with more than 20 million holidaymakers covered annually. Almost all big travel companies operating in the UK are part of the scheme, which is funded by their contribution of \u00a32.50 per passenger protected. In the event that a travel provider goes out of business, the scheme promises holidaymakers a refund or a flight home. The new legislation will ensure Atol protection covers passengers who book flights, hotels or car hire that are not sold as part of package holidays. From next year, when holidaymakers book a flight and are then directed by the airline to a separate company to book accommodation, within 24 hours the holiday will be covered. In recent years, a growing number of British holidaymakers have been unwittingly caught out by the lack of an Atol guarantee when things go wrong. The collapse last summer of LowCostHolidays left 110,000 holidaymakers out of pocket and highlighted how people were left vulnerable by booking through websites that appeared to be British but were in fact based overseas so not under the Atol umbrella. Many of those who bought expensive holidays from LowCost had been unaware that in 2013 the company, which ran glitzy TV ads, had moved its corporate base from the UK to Majorca, and with that ceased to be covered by Atol. In 2013 the Civil Aviation Authority had warned that LowCost was no longer offering protection. But at that time Irish regulators had gone much further and demanded that the company supply a bond after it moved its business to Spain so Irish holidaymakers got full refunds. In the end LowCost\u2019s administrators predicted that holidaymakers would each receive compensation of less than \u00a310. The Atol bill, which is getting its second reading in parliament on Monday is the first to be debated in the House of Commons since the Queen\u2019s speech.",

      "bodyText": "Nisa, the convenience chain that is in takeover talks with Sainsbury\u2019s, has angered several hundred head office staff by denying them annual bonuses despite hitting performance targets. Last week, 280 staff at Nisa\u2019s Scunthorpe head office were told there would be no bonus payment despite the company reporting an 18% increase in underlying profits to \u00a38.6m. The board\u2019s decision is said to have dented morale at the company, which the Guardian revealed was locked in talks with Sainsbury\u2019s over a \u00a3130m deal. With annual sales of \u00a31.25bn, Nisa has been catapulted into the limelight after Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn takeover of Booker, the wholesaler behind the Londis and Budgens chains, kickstarted consolidation in the convenience store sector. The convenience market has become a key battleground for the major supermarket chains as Britons shun the big weekly shop in favour of small top-up shops on their doorstep. Last year, Nisa staff shared a \u00a32.2m pot, although that included a \u00a3300,000 bonus for chief executive Nick Read. For the staff, in this low-wage area of the country, the prized annual bonus can be several thousand pounds, with many using the payment to fund their summer holiday. Staff complain of feeling \u201cbetrayed\u201d and demotivated at the loss of the bonus, which is paid at the discretion of the board. Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive Mike Coupe is expected to be questioned about the Nisa deal when he updates the City on first-quarter trading at Britain\u2019s second-largest supermarket group on Tuesday. Last year, Sainsbury\u2019s pulled off a major deal, acquiring Argos for \u00a31.4bn in a move to broaden its product offer. Through Nisa, the grocer would have access to 3,000 convenience stores at a time when it is struggling to acquire new sites to expand its own convenience arm. As Sainsbury\u2019s pores over Nisa\u2019s books, a big question mark hangs over a key contract to supply McColl\u2019s, the 1,375 strong convenience and newsagent chain, which is up for negotiation. Retaining the McColl\u2019s business, which accounts for more than 40% of Nisa\u2019s sales, is key to Nisa\u2019s future but is not thought to be a condition of the Sainsbury\u2019s deal. For the deal to go ahead, 75% of Nisa\u2019s 1,400 members, who each own between one and 250 shares in the group, must vote in favour of selling the business. These retailers, some of whom run small chains, have historically prized their independence as part of the Northern Independent Supermarket Association (Nisa), formed to help independents fight back against the \u201cinsurgence of the national supermarket chains\u201d. While some Nisa members have voiced their concerns about the prospect of a deal, others are eager to be part of a bigger group that is better able to strike deals with major suppliers on their behalf.",

The four are charged with offences following a five-year investigation into the events surrounding the \u00a311.8bn emergency fundraising conducted by the bank in 2008 that allowed it to avoid a bailout by the taxpayer. The decision to charge the four came after a series of postponements and amid plans in the Conservative manifesto for the Serious Fraud Office to be abolished \u2013 a threat that now appears to have been dropped after it did not feature in the Queen\u2019s speech, which sets out the government\u2019s agenda for the coming year.

      "bodyText": "Worries about the economic outlook and a squeeze on household budgets dented consumer confidence this month, according to a closely watched survey. The monthly barometer of consumer mood from the market research firm GfK dropped to its lowest level since the aftermath of last summer\u2019s EU referendum. Based on polling of 2,000 people before and after the inconclusive general election, the index hit -10 for June. That was down markedly from -5 in May and worse than forecasts for a -7 reading in a Reuters poll of economists. All measures in the survey deteriorated in June: people\u2019s view of their personal financial situation over the past year and over the coming year; their view of the general economic situation; and their appetite for making big purchases such as furniture. The report follows official figures showing that pay is falling again in real terms thanks to a combination of lacklustre wage growth and rising inflation. Inflation has been rising on the back of a weak pound since the Brexit vote, which has made imports to the UK more expensive. Joe Staton at GfK noted that the overall index was just two points above the -12 reading in July last year when confidence tumbled after the referendum. \u201cThe scores on the general economic situation looking forward and back 12 months are now particularly weak,\u201d Staton added. \u201cStrong consumer spending has propped up the economy since last June but now the twin pressures of higher prices and sluggish wage growth are squeezing household finances and adding to widespread fears of a Brexit-induced economic slowdown.\u201d The UK economy confounded gloomy forecasts for a sharp slowdown after the Brexit vote but lost momentum at the turn of the year. Economic forecasters widely expect that growth this year will be significantly lower than in 2016 as Brexit talks weigh on business confidence and higher inflation squeezes consumers. There were further signs of consumer worries in separate polling by Lloyds Bank published on Friday. It found the proportion of people feeling good about their personal finances fell last month as rising prices and slow wage growth took their toll. The proportion of consumers reporting a positive assessment of their personal financial situation dipped to 63% in May from 65% in April. The survey also showed a rise in the proportion of people feeling pessimistic about inflation after it hit a four-year high in May. The proportion of people who said they had money left over after they had covered all monthly outgoings fell to 80% in May from 84% in April. \u201cInflation continues to be front of mind when people consider the health of their personal finances. With consumers now reporting a significant impact on their disposable income, there\u2019s simply less money left over each month for buying the occasional treat,\u201d said Robin Bulloch, managing director at Lloyds. \u201cAnd while recent falls in forecourt petrol prices may provide some relief, it\u2019s the rising cost of food and drink which continues to really stretch the purse strings. With little change in these broad trends likely in the short term, households should prepare for a further squeeze on their spending power in the months ahead.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Horror stories told by central bankers will not end in an interest rate shock", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wherever investors looked last week, the picture was rosy. The eurozone, for so long the laggard in the global growth league, could be seen zipping along following first-quarter GDP growth that hit 0.6%. German business confidence hit a record high, and France and Italy finally joined the party with higher than expected output. In the US, official estimates upgraded growth for the first quarter to an annualised 1.4% from an initial estimate of 0.7%. Even Japan, the standard-bearer for more than 20 years of economic stagnation, is due to exceed expectations this year as exports soar. The post-crash years of political upheaval and the threat of nations going bankrupt are long gone. The upbeat global outlook prompted central bankers to allow talk of a subject that has always caused turmoil on global markets whenever it is mentioned, namely higher interest rates. Last week was no exception. When Bank of England governor Mark Carney discussed how business investment, productivity and wages would soon begin to rise, the pound jumped past $1.30. Investors, interpreting Carney as a not-so-secret hawk who would gladly increase the cost of credit, bought the pound in droves, pushing up its value against the dollar. Mario Draghi, the boss of the European Central Bank, spoke in a similar vein. He considered the day when the ECB might begin to withdraw some of the monetary stimulus that has done so much to keep the single currency and its member states afloat. The governor of the Bank of Canada joined the frenzy of hawkish comments in an interview that had him saying low rates had \u201cdone their job\u201d. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, in London for a speech at the Royal Academy, pledged the US central bank to raising rates in accordance with its stated policy, despite some forecasts showing that recent growth upgrades could prove to be a false dawn. Bond dealers listened to all these comments and went into meltdown. Could it be, they asked, that the years of cheap and plentiful central bank funds were coming to an end? Within minutes a bond sell-off was in full swing. Fortunately, a more considered position eventually held sway and the markets settled down. A closer look at Carney, Draghi and Yellen\u2019s comments showed that little had changed. Britain is still in the grip of uncertainty \u2013 political and economic \u2013 as the early skirmishes in a two-year battle over Brexit have clearly shown. Carney\u2019s almost academic discussion of when rates could rise was heavily caveated with doom about Brexit and its potential for harm. Draghi was essentially restating his existing position and Yellen was doing the same. To emphasise the point, Japan\u2019s central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said he would maintain Tokyo\u2019s loose monetary policy and low interest rates for the foreseeable future. And a look at the economic data shows there is a more mixed picture than the bald GDP numbers would have investors believe. As one leading economic consultancy said, as the stock- and bond-market gyrations eased, rising inflation and sluggish wage growth, among other things, means that UK growth is expected to deteriorate this year. \u201cAs with Draghi\u2019s comments, we think investors have misinterpreted Carney\u2019s message, and a rate hike this year is not the most likely outcome.\u201d Meanwhile a GfK survey of UK consumer confidence fell to within touching distance of its post-referendum low, as households face a squeeze on their real incomes. Essentially, Europe still has its problems, as the Italian bank bailouts last week illustrated. The Nordic countries have high household debt ratios and the French are only at base camp in the long climb to economic credibility. These are not overheating economies that need cooling with interest rate rises. They are economies bedevilled by the legacies of the last crisis, many of which still need to be dealt with. End of the line for heads-I-win-tails-you-lose rail franchising Whatever the fate of the east coast rail franchise, Virgin Trains has at least shown some staying power. On a line that promised easy pickings, first GNER and then National Express each lasted only 18 months before announcing they couldn\u2019t make it work. The present incumbent has managed two years before confirming it would be seeking some form of bailout, demanding that the Department for Transport renegotiate with preferential terms for the Stagecoach-Virgin partnership. The east coast line was reprivatised in 2015 after more than five years in the public sector. It had returned more than \u00a31bn in premiums to the Treasury, with dividends on top \u2013 a figure that Stagecoach confidently asserted it would trump. It may still do so. But the bulk of the promised \u00a33.3bn was due towards the end of the eight-year franchise \u2013 and it is already balking. What has reprivatisation brought? Some investment in customer service: \u00a321m spent on train interiors and ticketing innovations. But Virgin wasted no time in making passengers pay even more: its stealth rises alone doubled the average rail fare increase across Britain in 2016. Rail franchising has teetered on the brink since the fiasco that saw Virgin and Stagecoach being left to run the other London to Scotland mainline, west coast, in 2012. Genuine competition on UK railways has been the exception ever since the network was privatised. Now there is the unedifying prospect of the government funnelling more money into the pockets of two of Britain\u2019s richest men, Brian Souter and Richard Branson, who have made a fortune in dividends since privatisation. The DfT must not perpetuate the scandal of heads-I-win-tails-you-lose franchising, where business wants the taxpayer \u2013 and fare-paying passenger \u2013 to underwrite its losses. The government should not expend energy and money trying to bail out another private firm. Rather, it should call its bluff, harness the public mood, and nationalise east coast now. Doing the maths matters, even at miserably low interest Andy Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England, made an interesting observation last week. \u201cFor whatever reason,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is far less of a social stigma attached to failings in maths than there is to reading and writing. It\u2019s socially acceptable not to have a head for figures, not to have a maths brain.\u201d Haldane was speaking in his role as trustee of charity National Numeracy, and he is quite right. Indeed, it can be a badge of honour to admit that a working out a percentage is too hard. Haldane, however, demonstrated his own prowess by calculating that \u00a38,400 of savings at a 2.5% rate of interest would generate \u00a3210 in the first year. That was a hypothetical example, obviously, given that data from Moneyfacts shows a third of savings accounts now earn less than the 0.25% base rate. Even so, Haldane should keep banging on about numeracy.",

      "body": "<p>Wherever investors looked last week, the picture was rosy. The eurozone, for so long the laggard in the global growth league, could be seen zipping along following first-quarter GDP growth that hit 0.6%.</p> <p>German business confidence hit a record high, and France and Italy finally joined the party with higher than expected output. In the US, official estimates upgraded growth for the first quarter to an annualised 1.4% from an initial estimate of 0.7%. Even Japan, the standard-bearer for more than 20 years of economic stagnation, is due to exceed expectations this year as exports soar.</p> <p>The post-crash years of political upheaval and the threat of nations going bankrupt are long gone. The upbeat global outlook prompted central bankers to allow talk of a subject that has always caused turmoil on global markets whenever it is mentioned, namely higher interest rates. Last week was no exception.</p> <p>When Bank of England governor Mark Carney discussed how business investment, productivity and wages would soon begin to rise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/28/bank-of-england-deputy-interest-rate-mpc-cunliffe-mark-carney\" title=\"\">the pound jumped</a> past $1.30. Investors, interpreting Carney as a not-so-secret hawk who would gladly increase the cost of credit, bought the pound in droves, pushing up its value against the dollar.</p> <p>Mario Draghi, the boss of the European Central Bank, spoke in a similar vein. He considered the day when the ECB might begin to withdraw some of the monetary stimulus that has done so much to keep the single currency and its member states afloat.</p> <p>The governor of the Bank of Canada joined the frenzy of hawkish comments in an interview that had him saying low rates had \u201cdone their job\u201d.</p> <p>Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, in London for a speech at the Royal Academy, pledged the US central bank to raising rates in accordance with its stated policy, despite some forecasts showing that recent growth upgrades could prove to be a false dawn.</p> <p>Bond dealers listened to all these comments and went into meltdown. Could it be, they asked, that the years of cheap and plentiful central bank funds were coming to an end? Within minutes a bond sell-off was in full&#xa0;swing.</p> <p>Fortunately, a more considered position eventually held sway and the markets settled down. A closer look at Carney, Draghi and Yellen\u2019s comments showed that little had changed.</p> <p>Britain is still in the grip of uncertainty \u2013 political and economic \u2013 as the early skirmishes in a two-year battle over Brexit have clearly shown. Carney\u2019s almost academic discussion of when rates could rise was heavily caveated with doom about Brexit and its potential for harm. Draghi was essentially restating his existing position and Yellen was doing the same.</p> <p>To emphasise the point, Japan\u2019s central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said he would maintain Tokyo\u2019s loose monetary policy and low interest rates for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>And a look at the economic data shows there is a more mixed picture than the bald GDP numbers would have investors believe. As one leading economic consultancy said, as the stock- and bond-market gyrations eased, rising inflation and sluggish wage growth, among other things, means that UK growth is expected to deteriorate this year. \u201cAs with Draghi\u2019s comments, we think investors have misinterpreted Carney\u2019s message, and a rate hike this year is not the most likely outcome.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile a GfK survey of UK consumer confidence fell to within touching distance of its post-referendum low, as households face a squeeze on their real incomes.</p> <p>Essentially, Europe still has its problems, as the Italian bank bailouts last week illustrated. The Nordic countries have high household debt ratios and the French are only at base camp in the long climb to economic credibility. These are not overheating economies that need cooling with interest rate rises. They are economies bedevilled by the legacies of the last crisis, many of which still need to be dealt&#xa0;with.</p> <h2>End of the line for heads-I-win-tails-you-lose rail franchising</h2> <p>Whatever the fate of the east coast rail franchise, Virgin Trains has at least shown some staying power. On a line that promised easy pickings, first GNER and then National Express each lasted only 18 months before announcing they couldn\u2019t make it work. The present incumbent has managed two years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/28/stagecoach-says-it-has-overpaid-for-east-coast-rail-contract\" title=\"\">before confirming it would be seeking some form of bailout</a>, demanding that the Department for Transport renegotiate with preferential terms for the Stagecoach-Virgin partnership.</p> <p>The east coast line was reprivatised in 2015 after more than five years in the public sector. It had returned more than \u00a31bn in premiums to the Treasury, with dividends on top \u2013 a figure that Stagecoach confidently asserted it would trump. It may still do so. But the bulk of the promised \u00a33.3bn was due towards the end of the eight-year franchise \u2013 and it is already balking.</p> <p>What has reprivatisation brought? Some investment in customer service: \u00a321m spent on train interiors and ticketing innovations. But Virgin wasted no time in making passengers pay even more: its stealth rises alone doubled the average rail fare increase across Britain in 2016.</p> <p>Rail franchising has teetered on the brink since the fiasco that saw Virgin and Stagecoach being left to run the other London to Scotland mainline, west coast, in 2012. Genuine competition on UK railways has been the exception ever since the network was privatised.</p> <p>Now there is the unedifying prospect of the government funnelling more money into the pockets of two of Britain\u2019s richest men, Brian Souter and Richard Branson, who have made a fortune in dividends since privatisation. The DfT must not perpetuate the scandal of heads-I-win-tails-you-lose franchising, where business wants the taxpayer \u2013 and fare-paying passenger \u2013 to underwrite its losses.</p> <p>The government should not expend energy and money trying to bail out another private firm. Rather, it should call its bluff, harness the public mood, and nationalise east coast now.</p> <h2>Doing the maths matters, even at miserably low interest</h2> <p>Andy Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England, made an interesting observation last week. \u201cFor whatever reason,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is far less of a social stigma attached to failings in maths than there is to reading and writing. It\u2019s socially acceptable not to have a head for figures, not to have a maths brain.\u201d</p> <p>Haldane was speaking in his role as trustee of charity National Numeracy, and he is quite right. Indeed, it can be a badge of honour to admit that a working out a percentage is too hard. Haldane, however, demonstrated his own prowess by calculating that \u00a38,400 of savings at a 2.5% rate of interest would generate \u00a3210 in the first year. That was a hypothetical example, obviously, given that data from Moneyfacts shows a third of savings accounts now earn less than the 0.25% base rate. Even so, Haldane should keep banging on about numeracy.</p>",

The $93bn (\u00a371bn) SoftBank Vision Fund, which is backed by the state investment funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, as well as a host of technology firms including Apple and Japan\u2019s Sharp, is said to be in the talks with Deliveroo, which wants to raise funds to finance expansion. Last year, Deliveroo raised $275m from investors, taking the amount of cash raised by the delivery app, which was founded by Will Shu, a former investment banker, close to $500m. It is thought the current round of meetings with investors is looking to raise a similar amount. If Deliveroo secures the predicted injection of funds, the valuation could be as high as $1.5bn, according to Sky News. This would turn turn Shu into one of the British tech sector\u2019s wealthiest entrepreneurs. Deliveroo\u2019s plans are widely anticipated to include a stock market listing. Deliveroo could not be reached for comment.

In April it emerged that managers at Deliveroo had been given a list of dos and don\u2019ts setting out how to talk to the firm\u2019s couriers, using terms that appeared designed to fend off claims the couriers were employees. Couriers should be referred to as \u201cindependent suppliers\u201d, according to the document seen by the Guardian, and that, instead of hiring riders at a recruitment centre, senior staff should undertake \u201conboarding\u201d at a \u201csupply centre\u201d. In a key case relating to the future of the gig economy, the Central Arbitration Committee is investigating whether Deliveroo\u2019s drivers are independent contractors, as the company argues, or whether they should be classified as workers with rights to holiday pay, the national minimum wage and collective bargaining via a union. Matthew Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair, who was appointed by the prime minister last year to lead a review into the gig economy, is also due to report back.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More small energy firms could go bust this winter because of increasing price volatility driven by green energy growth and the closure of Britain\u2019s largest gas storage plant, one of the challenger suppliers has warned. David Bird, chief executive of Co-operative Energy, said that the regulator Ofgem needed to set financial stress tests for new market entrants, to reduce the risk of firms folding and customers being left in the lurch. Co-operative Energy almost doubled its customer base overnight when it was appointed to take over the 160,000 customers of GB Energy, which collapsed last November when wholesale prices spiked. It now has 410,000 customers. \u201cWith the way the whole energy mix is moving, we will see far more volatility in the [wholesale] market, and therefore I think we will see more of the small suppliers go bust,\u201d said Bird, who left the big-six firm E.ON earlier this year to join the Co-op. GB Energy ceased trading abruptly, blaming \u201cswift and significant increases in energy prices\u201d, leaving customers fearing they would lose credit on their balances. Bird said those consumers had not been negatively impacted during their switchover to the Co-op, but added: \u201cIt has revealed a lot of flaws in the process, which we\u2019re working with Ofgem to remedy.\u201d He warned that if those concerns about the supplier of last resort process were not fixed by the winter, householders could be in quite a \u201cdifferent situation\u201d to GB Energy\u2019s former customers if other firms went under. Ofgem said it was considering whether to consult on guidance for the process. Concerns over the stability of some small firms led Dermot Nolan, Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, to say in February that he would \u201creview our approach to awarding supply licences, the financial requirements on suppliers.\u201d Bird said he supported a change to the licensing conditions: \u201cThere should be some form of financial stress test; it doesn\u2019t need to be unnecessarily onerous.\u201d The chief executive\u2019s warning about energy companies going bust is supported by industry watchers. Nigel Cornwall, founder of energy analysts Cornwall, said the record number of fully licensed domestic suppliers \u2013 now up to 58 \u2013 was unlikely to last. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of people who take very quick routes into the market. An awful lot of suppliers in market, with more to follow. We would expect to see consolidation, acquisition. \u201cIf we have increasing turbulence in prices, you can expect to see more failure, in my view,\u201d he said. The acquisitions have already begun. State-owned Swedish company Vattenfall, which only recently entered the business supply market in Britain, earlier this month bought Bournemouth-based iSupply, which has 120,000 customers, to compete in the consumer market. Bird said the arrival of powerful foreign players such as Vattenfall and France\u2019s Engie highlighted the \u201cperverse\u201d fact that only suppliers with more than 250,000 customers in Britain had to pay towards fuel poverty schemes. \u201cThe big issue for me is I look at the way ECO [the Energy Company Obligation energy-efficiency scheme ] obligations and Warm Home Discount is funded. It\u2019s funded by about a dozen players in the market and there\u2019s now nearly a hundred [domestic and non-domestic suppliers],\u201d said Bird. Research by the competition watchdog has found that people who switched suppliers in the past three years \u2013 and are therefore more likely to be with a smaller supplier \u2013 tend to be younger, educated to degree level and own a property, while non-switchers are older, live in rented accommodation and are less well-off financially. Bird said: \u201cYou have almost got the people that are recipients of it [fuel poverty schemes] funding it, and that\u2019s a perverse tax. Whereas you have then got the people switching in the market, who are wealthier and more able to pay [who are not paying towards those schemes].\u201d He added: \u201cParticularly now with Engie and Vattenfall coming in, these are people that should be paying the taxes, and that is distorting the whole market.\u201d Such obligations add costs of approximately \u00a341 per customer. Engie recorded revenues of \u20ac66.6bn last year but has signed up 21,000 customers since launching in Britain last December, so does not have to pay towards the schemes. Bird said some small suppliers had told him they did not want to grow beyond 250,000 customers because, if they did, the obligations mean they would no longer be able to compete on price. The Co-op lost customers due to pricing over the winter, falling from 424,000 in 2016 to 410,000 now. The company also made a slight loss on \u00a3281m revenue last year, for the first time since it started up in 2010, as a result of investment in customer service to tackle earlier failings. Last year, Ofgem ordered the firm to pay back \u00a31.8m to customers over an IT and billing problem, and last week it came third from bottom in a customer service league table of energy suppliers. \u201cWe had problems. It\u2019s no excuse,\u201d said Bird. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident we are through that.\u201d For Bird, the future of the company hinges on staying true to the roots in its name, and supporting community-run renewable energy projects. The supplier has power-purchase agreements with more than 40 such solar and hydro projects, and is headed towards more than 60 next year. \u201cThe next step could be taking a direct stake in those projects,\u201d Bird said. \u201cI think we should look at investing in community generation. I think [energy] storage is going to be critical in future \u2013 that\u2019s the gamechanger.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Imagine, if you will, a city the size of Birmingham with a population of a million or so. Now imagine that a disaster has befallen that metropolis, a brutal war that has caused its citizens to flee with little more than the clothes on their backs. Picture the lines of refugees heading west to find a place of safety, which they eventually find across the border in Wales. There, despite severe financial constraints, the million displaced people are met with warmth and generosity. This is not a science-fiction story. Substitute South Sudan for Birmingham and Wales for Uganda and you get an inkling of what is happening in one of the poorest parts of the world\u2019s poorest continent. The number of refugees globally has not been higher since the end of the second world war and a million of them have crossed from South Sudan into Uganda, mostly into the West Nile district. In all, an estimated two million people have been displaced by the civil war and ethnic cleansing that has been raging in the world\u2019s newest country for the past four years. Approximately three quarters of South Sudan\u2019s children are out of school \u2013 the highest number in the world. Unlike many western countries, Uganda has not demonised the new arrivals. The government has given the refugees land and seeds in the belief that they will be better off making a new life for themselves than doing nothing in a camp. Around half a million of the refugees that have crossed the border into Uganda from South Sudan are children. They have been fleeing at the rate of one a minute for the past year, putting additional strain on an already stretched Ugandan education system. They are being educated in classes of up to 150, without text books and by teachers who speak a different language. Western countries, including Britain, talk persuasively about how the only real way to reduce the flow of economic migrants out of Africa is to provide them with an incentive to stay where they are. That means providing them with hope, which in turn means giving them a decent start in life through a decently funded education. Likewise, the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, expressed concern back in April that there were now two billion people living in parts of the world affected by fragility, conflict and violence. Kim predicted there would be serious consequences if the internet-fuelled aspirations of people living in developing countries were not met. The South Sudan-Uganda refugee crisis is going to show whether these fine words mean anything. It is a test for donor governments, for the World Bank, for the United Nations and for the Global Partnership for Education, the international body that has the job of providing quality schooling for poor countries. Thus far, they have not exactly covered themselves in glory. According to Save the Children, donor governments have funded just 17% of the UN appeal for the South Sudan refugee response in Uganda this year. The UN appealed for $61.6m (\u00a346.8m) for the education emergency, of which only a small fraction has been provided. As the charity notes, there has been quite a contrast between the response of the Ugandan government and that of the rest of the world. Uganda\u2019s response has been extraordinarily generous. The response of the international community has \u201cbordered on the derisory\u201d. To make matters worse, a Save the Children report adds that the funding provided has been short-term, unpredictable and focused on individual projects. \u201cThis has made it impossible for the government of Uganda, UN agencies and national and international NGOs to plan for what has all the hallmarks of a protracted and systemic crisis requiring a long-term, predictable finance to underpin a credible programme. In effect, the international community has turned its back on some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable children, leaving Uganda and host communities living in endemic poverty, to shoulder the responsibility alone.\u201d Fixing the problem would be relatively cheap: Save the Children estimates it would cost $132m a year for three and a half years to provide pre-primary, primary and secondary education for all the South Sudanese children living in Uganda. Given the numbers, this amounts to $152 per child annually \u2013 or less than $3 a week. Such a scheme would have the added benefits of employing refugee teachers from South Sudan and of strengthening the Uganda education system. At a time when aid spending is (rightly) filtered through the lens of whether it offers value for money, investing $500m in the education of South Sudanese refugee children is a colossal bargain. Long-term funding sources are available. The World Bank has a special fund, the International Development Association, that provides grants and soft loans for the least developed countries. The IDA is replenished by donors on a three-yearly basis, 47 of whom agreed to provide $25bn for the current round of funding. A further $25bn is coming from the bank\u2019s own resources, with a third $25bn being raised from the global financial market. A welcome innovation in the new IDA round was the creation of a window for financing refugees and helping host country programmes. Some $2.5bn was set aside for precisely the sort of emergency that is happening in Uganda. It is time the bank pulled its finger out. Likewise, the Global Partnership for Education has money allocated for South Sudan that is not being spent. This is hardly surprising given that half a million South Sudanese children are in Uganda and perhaps a further half a million are in other neighbouring countries. The Global Partnership for Education does not normally do cross-border funding, but these are not normal circumstances.",

      "bodyText": "As the true extent of the Brexit farce becomes more apparent, it is now open warfare between the Brexiters, while the rest of the world \u2013 with the possible exceptions of Presidents Putin and Trump \u2013 look on in sympathetic bewilderment. One of several satisfactory aspects of the election result was the way that Theresa May and her advisers at No 10 met their comeuppance over their widely leaked plans to sack the chancellor of the exchequer. Philip Hammond\u2019s sin was to let them know that the warnings of our Brussels-based ambassador Sir Ivan Rogers, whom they sacked, were prescient; that making the country poorer was neither good politics nor good economics; and that our continental partners were not going let us have our cake and eat it. The way my old friend, exit secretary David Davis, caved in to the insistence from the EU27 that this so-called negotiation be dealt with according to their timetable, not his, was no less embarrassing for being so predictable. In case anybody hasn\u2019t noticed, I ought to point out at this stage that the buzzword in Brussels and London is now \u201ctransition\u201d. The two-year timetable for Brexit is patently absurd. The debate is over how to handle the transition and how long it should be, with influential Remainers hoping that the transition will take several hundred years and that meanwhile we will remain inside the customs union and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s greatest achievement, the single market. At which point I should like to quote from a recent lecture by Sir Brian Unwin to the Norwegian parliament. Unwin is not only a former Treasury official and chairman of Customs and Excise, but was also president of the European Investment Bank. The EIB has been an unsung hero of the financing of much of the infrastructure investment in this country that our austerity-obsessed government has eschewed, and Unwin worries about what happens after the Brexit that we both still hope will not happen. But it is not just EIB investment that will be lost. A lot of investment plans are on hold, at a time when, as the City economist Andrew Smithers argues, the short-term culture of modern chief executives is already having a damaging impact on the investment that is key to productivity. The evidence for concern about Brexit-induced potential loss of trading and investment opportunities is accumulating thick and fast. I was particularly struck by Unwin\u2019s point that, if the UK is forced to follow the hard Brexiters\u2019 path towards dependence on World Trade Organisation rules, \u201cit will find itself subject to substantial tariffs on its exports to and imports from the EU and possibly no deal for finance and services at all\u201d. As Lord Adonis pointed out in the Lords debate on the Queen\u2019s speech last week, more than 60% of our trade is with the EU or with other countries with which we enjoy free or preferential access as members of the customs union and single market. Leave? What folly! The Global Policy Institute estimates that leaving could lead to a drop in national output of more than 10%. As Unwin points out: \u201cIn order to implement the tariffs the UK would also have to restore customs controls and documentation at the border.\u201d Most of these were removed when Unwin was chairman of Customs and Excise in the late 1980s, as the single market was implemented. Unwin echoes the warning of Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, about potential costs, queues and delays, citing an estimate that \u201cthis could quadruple the number of documents needing to be processed \u2013 from some 90 to 390 million\u201d. (Nothing like an assault on red tape, eh?) And why is all this nonsense happening? Largely because of the anti-Europeanism that Lord Heseltine recently described as \u201cthe cancer gnawing away at the heart of the Conservative party\u201d. Heseltine is still fighting. The former \u201cwet\u201d Tory and now Liberal Democrat Lord Dykes told me last week that he was shocked to hear Kenneth Clarke saying he had accepted that we were now leaving the EU. So was I. Which brings us back to his successor but three, Philip Hammond. Hammond frequently states that the British people (or some of them) voted to leave the EU but not to become poorer. There is a logical problem here: leaving the EU means the nation becomes poorer. Even my eccentric old Brexiter friend Lord Lawson apparently conceded this point recently to a private gathering (I am not betraying a confidence; this was reported in the Evening Standard.) So did the 37% of the electorate who voted for Brexit know what they were doing? We should be told! As the historian Sir David Cannadine recently reminded an audience at the British Academy, the problem with democracy, according to Plato, is that it elevates opinion above knowledge. Although, as Churchill said, it is better than the alternative. Can the circle be squared? We need statesmanship, or stateswomanship. It should be possible, at heads-of-government level, for the other 27 EU countries to make a minor concession on the \u201cfree movement of workers\u201d front so that parliament (sovereignty!), not the EU, would decide national immigration policy. Finally, all those Brexiters who advocate a European Free Trade Area solution ought to be aware that it was because Efta was so unsatisfactory that we joined what became the EU. As Adonis pointed out, Efta\u2019s equivalent of the European commission is called the surveillance authority. He added: \u201cI look forward to that Orwellian construct being sold to the Daily Mail.\u201d",
