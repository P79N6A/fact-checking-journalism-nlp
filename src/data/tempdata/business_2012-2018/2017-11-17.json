      "bodyText": "A downbeat end to the week for equities saw declines in most major markets. Worries about the Republican\u2019s prospects of getting their tax cut proposals left Wall Street lagging, while some downbeat results and broker downgrades undermined European shares. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 6.26 points or 0.08% at 7380.68 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.41% to 12,993.73 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.32% lower at 5319.17 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.51% to 22,092.95 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.78% at 10,010.4 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.58% to 712.46 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 82.9 points or 0.35%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Carillion is one of the day\u2019s biggest fallers following another profit warning. Jill Treanor writes: Carillion, one of the construction companies working on the HS2 London to Birmingham rail line, is racing to refinance its business after issuing its third profit warning in five months and suffering a collapse in share price. Shares in the company, which is at the heart of several major building projects in the UK, were suspended eight times on Friday after the shock update to the City that it would breach the terms on its existing lending at the end of the year. The shares crashed 60% when the stock market opened on Friday \u2013 to their lowest ever levels \u2013 and were still down nearly 40% near the end of the day\u2019s trading. At this price, about 25p, the shares are barely a tenth of the 240p level seen at the start of 2017 and values the company at just \u00a3120m. Carillion has debts of \u00a31.6bn and analysts expect the company \u2013 known for its work on expanding the main stand at Liverpool\u2019s Anfield football ground and its ongoing development of Battersea power station \u2013 to have to ask its lenders to swap their debt for shares. The company employs 30,000, two-thirds of them in the UK, and has contracts with the Highways Agency, Network Rail and the Ministry of Defence. It is building hospitals including Merseyside\u2019s Royal Liverpool and also has a support services operation which has maintenance contracts for buildings. The government, one of its major customers, said it was being kept informed. The full story is here: Meanwhile over in Athens thousands of Greeks chanting anti-austerity and anti-capitalist slogans are marching through the city centre to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Polytechnic uprising against military rule, writes Helena Smith. Greek riot police, bracing for possible violence, are out in force. Communist party members, holding red flags aloft, are leading the protest and using it to decry the\u201dbarbaric\u201d policies enforced on workers. \u201cBrussels you won\u2019t be able to disentangle yourself from the left\u201d is among the chants currently wafting over the capital. Anti-US slogans are also rife with demonstrators deploring the agreements the leftist led government recently signed with Washington during official White House talks between the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and US president Donald Trump. Global markets are shrugging their way towards the end of the week, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: The Dow Jones dipped 50-ish points after the bell, keeping the right side of 23400 as investors (very lightly) fretted over the Republicans\u2019 ability to get their tax plan through Congress. The dollar, meanwhile, could only ease, rather than eradicate, the day\u2019s losses, with the greenback down 0.1% against the pound, 0.2% against the euro and 0.5% against the yen as investors process the news that Robert Mueller subpoenaed more than a dozen of Trump\u2019s campaign officials back in October. Over in the Eurozone the euro\u2019s gains continued to cause a headache for the region\u2019s indices. The DAX slipped 0.1%, the CAC 0.4% and the IBEX 0.8%, cementing a rather miserable week for the trio. As for the FTSE, despite a relatively flaccid performance by the pound, and the reversal of early losses in the commodity sector, the UK index just couldn\u2019t get anything going this Friday. Instead it sat flat around 7390, preventing from taking off thanks, in part, to United Utilities and Severn Trent. The UK water sector was hit by a downgrade on United Utilities from HSBC analysts, who cut their recommendation from buy to hold. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $8000 after reports that a software upgrade which could split the cryptocurrency in two was going ahead. The price had fallen last week on suggestions the upgrade would be suspended. The move would mean owners of Bitcoin would in theory also hold the new spin-off, and sell it at a profit. Bitcoin has risen more than 700% this year and is on track for its best week since July. David Cheetham, chief market analyst, at XTB said: Major fundamental concerns remain as to the efficacy of Bitcoin but for now price remains in a strong uptrend and many observers experiencing FOMO (fear of missing out) are looking at any drops as buying opportunities. After showing good gains on Thursday, US markets are on the slide again. With the latest results season coming to a close and no major economic data due, investors are focused on political issues, especially concerns about the Republicans\u2019 ability to get their tax reforms through Congress. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 66 points or 0.28% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.14% lower. But the Nasdaq Composite has bucked the trend, opening broadly flat. One standout performer is retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. After more than a year of declines, it reported strong quarterly sales growth of 4% and forecast postive sales for the forthcoming holiday period. Its results were boosted by a strong performance from its surfwear brand Hollister. The company, which failed to sell its business in July, saw its shares jump 20% following the latest figures. Shares in Carillion have fallen from about 240p at the beginning of this year to 28p today: US homebuilding jumped to a one-year high in October as communities hit by hurricanes started to replace homes damaged by flooding. Housing starts jumped by 13.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million homes, the Commerce Department said. It was the highest level since October 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a smaller number, at 1.18 million homes. The increase in starts ended three consecutive monthly declines. Benchmark Brent crude oil is currently up 1.2% or 72 cents at $62.05 a barrel. But it is still on course for the first weekly loss in six, as Russia\u2019s reluctance to cut production fuels concerns of oversupply. Prices are expected to end the week 2% to 3% lower than the end of last week. Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said the rise today shouldn\u2019t be overplayed. After five days of continuous losses, an upside correction is always on the cards. Such a jump, however, will not mean a change of heart. Over in Greece, EU auditors have given a mixed verdict on the handling of the country\u2019s three bailouts. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The three financial lifelines thrown Greece in 2010, 2012 and 2015 achieved their overarching goal of averting default but were far from successful in other respects, EU auditors have concluded. Issuing their first in-depth look into the cash- for-reform programmes, the independent Luxembourg-based court of auditors said Greece\u2019s continued inability to finance itself on international markets \u201cremains a challenge.\u201d Design and implementation of economic policies was poorly judged, the watchdog claimed, with Greece\u2019s economic depression being much deeper than ever envisaged as a result of tough fiscal measures. It added: The [EU] commission did not comprehensively consider Greece\u2019s implementation capacity in the design process and thus did not adapt the scope and timing accordingly. More than \u20ac350bn has been poured into Greece by the EU and IMF to keep the country afloat. The Greek government, which is preparing to exit the country\u2019s third \u20ac86bn rescue programme in August 2018 \u2013 and is desperately trying to rally spirits ahead of that \u2013 did not comment on the report. It is far from sure if Greece will require further aid when its current programme officially expires. The FTSE 100 has reversed its earlier losses and is now up 15 points, partly because the pound\u2019s earlier gains have largely been erased. The FTSE tends to do better when the pound is weaker, because so many of the companies listed have significant overseas earnings. Here are the current scores across Europe: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,402 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 13,065 France\u2019s CAC: +0.2% at 5,345 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 22,158 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 10,058 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.1% at 384 The pound has lost some of its earlier sparkle and is now trading roughly flat against the dollar at $1.3197. It has also slipped agains the euro, down 0.2% at \u20ac1.1186. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains the gravity of the situation facing Carillion and its shareholders: Shares in Carillion have collapsed yet again as the troubled construction company stated it will breach its banking covenants. The company also lowered its profit outlook again and stated that their asset sale programme isn\u2019t going as fast as they had hoped. Things have gone from bad to worse at Carillion, and the business is in dire need to cash to keep the lights on. Even though the business has plenty of work in the pipeline, it must scramble for cash in order to keep its head above water. The UK government is one of Carillion\u2019s biggest clients and is monitoring the firm\u2019s troubles. Reuters quotes a spokeswoman at the Cabinet Office: The company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress \u201cCarillion horror show continues\u201d, is how Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, describes the latest developments at the construction firm. He adds: Some sort of recapitalisation was inevitable, but a possible debt for equity swap, with debt even higher than the group had anticipated, is probably as bad as anyone would have guessed. The group has made some progress on asset sales, and it sounds like some cost savings are being made. It\u2019s not what the group expected though, and it\u2019s clearly not enough. It\u2019s also probably irrelevant given the state of the balance sheet, with net debt already many multiples of the group\u2019s market capitalisation. Carillion shares plunged as much as 60% in early trading after the construction group involved in HS2 and Battersea Power Station issued its third profit warning of the year: The group now expects that a combination of delays to certain PPP disposals, a slippage in the commencement date of a significant project in the Middle East and lower than expected margin improvements across a small number of UK Support Services contracts, partially offset by cost savings initiatives realised in the fourth quarter, will lead to profits for the year to 31 December 2017 being materially lower than current market expectations. Shares are now down 37% at 26p. The company, which is struggling to cope with a large debt pile and badly-performing contracts, said the board expects a covenant breach at the end of December and will need to implement a recapitalisation plan. Keith Cochrane, interim chief executive, said: Whilst we continue to target cash collections, reduce costs, execute disposals and focus on delivering for our customers, it is clear that significant challenges remain and more needs to be done to reduce net debt and rebuild the balance sheet. Constructive dialogue is continuing with our financial stakeholders, and I am grateful for their support. I remain focused on addressing this issue before my successor, Andrew Davies, takes up the role on 2 April 2018. Love it or hate it, Black Friday is almost upon us. In recent years Britain has embraced the American tradition where retailers slash prices the day after Thanksgiving. British shoppers are expected to spend \u00a310.1bn in the week of Black Friday, which falls on 24 November this year. Just in case you\u2019re interested, here is a piece we\u2019ve done on some of the best deals going this year: News of Greggs controversial decision to replace the baby Jesus with a sausage roll in an advent calendar has rippled across the Atlantic: Draghi concludes by returning to one of his favourite themes, saying eurozone governments should do their bit to secure future economic stability by getting their \u201cfiscal houses in order\u201d. The ECB will do our bit, you do yours, is the message: ECB\u2019s mandate is framed in terms of price stability, as this is the best contribution that we can make to the welfare of citizens. Ensuring price stability is a precondition for the economy to be able to grow along a balanced path that can be sustained in the long run. This is the guiding principle of all our monetary policy decisions. With the recovery ongoing, now is the right moment for the euro area to address further challenges to stability. This means actively putting our fiscal houses in order and building up buffers for the future \u2013 not just waiting for growth to gradually reduce debt. It means implementing structural reforms that will allow our economies to converge and grow at higher speeds over the long term. And it means addressing the remaining gaps in the institutional architecture of our monetary union. The full text of Mario Draghi\u2019s speech is available on the ECB website: Here comes the \u201cbut\u201d part of the ECB president\u2019s speech. Mario Draghi says that despite solid growth and rising employment, inflation is not at the point where it will pick up without stimulus from the central bank. (Eurozone inflation dipped to 1.4% in October from 1.5% in September.) He says the recovery thus far has been highly dependent on the bank\u2019s support. The key quote: We are not yet at a point where the recovery of inflation can be self-sustained without our accommodative policy. A key motor of the recovery remains the very favourable financing conditions facing firms and households, which are in turn heavily contingent on our policy measures. An ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation over the medium term. The ECB announced last month that it would slow its bond-buying programme to \u20ac60bn to \u20ac30bn a month starting from January. However, it extended the support for at least another nine months to the end of September 2018, \u201cor beyond, if necessary,\u201d Draghi says. The key message here is that ECB policy is likely will remain supportive for some time to come. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Draghi is running through stats to illustrate how much the employment picture has improved in the eurozone. He says it \u201ca remarkable success story\u201d that unemployment has come down in the single currency-bloc at the same time that participation in the labour market is rising, as more women and older people enter the workforce. Consumption is being supported by a virtuous circle between rising labour income and rising employment. Employment in the euro area has reached its highest level ever, while unemployment has fallen to its lowest rate since January 2009. Importantly, this has taken place against the backdrop of a rising participation rate, which is now 2 percentage points above its pre-crisis level. This has been driven in particular by the increased entry of women into the workforce, whose participation rate has risen by 4 percentage points since 2008 and reached an all-time high. It has also been strongly driven by older people. Since the start of the crisis, the participation rate has increased by 3.6 percentage points for people aged 50-54, 13.6 percentage points for 55-59 year olds and 17.1 percentage points for 60-64 year olds. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is speaking in Frankfurt at the European Banking Congress. He begins on a positive note on the outlook for the eurozone economy: The euro area is in the midst of a solid economic expansion. GDP has risen for 18 straight quarters, with the latest data and surveys pointing to unabated growth momentum in the period ahead. From the ECB\u2019s perspective, we have increasing confidence that the recovery is robust and that this momentum will continue going forward. The FTSE is suffering from the stronger pound this morning, Spread Ex\u2019s Connor Campbell says: The pound\u2019s up 0.4% against the greenback, with the dollar losing its House tax plan-passing buzz, as Robert Mueller subpoenaed more than a dozen Trump campaign officials. Against the euro, meanwhile, sterling nudged 0.2% higher, keeping above \u20ac1.12. This meant the FTSE continued to founder around the 7380 mark, dipping 0.2% as it struggles to escape its 6-week lows. As has been the case all week, commodities are doing their part, with a smattering of red among the oil and mining stocks helping suppress appetite in the UK index. The FTSE 100 is down 17 points this morning, and the biggest faller among its major European peers: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,370 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2% at 13,074 France\u2019s CAC: -0.02% at 5,335 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.01 at 22,204 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.1% at 10,074 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.02% at 385 Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist, has been interviewed by the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott, and it\u2019s well worth a watch if you missed it: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has a spring in its step this morning, hitting a two-week high against the dollar of $1.3252. Sterling is benefitting from a sharp sell-off of the dollar triggered by reports in the US that special counsel Robert Mueller served President Trump\u2019s election campaign a subpoena in mid-October, requesting documents relating to Russia. As CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson explains, positive sentiment earlier in the day (generated by the passing of a bill in the House of Representatives aimed at cutting US company rates from 35% to 20%), quickly evaporated: The passing of yesterday\u2019s bill helped the US dollar close near its intraday peaks yesterday, while also helping push up US yields with the 2 year yield hitting its highest level since October 2008. These US dollar gains were pretty short-lived and soon gave way to selling on reports that Trump officials had been subpoenaed by special attorney Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian involvement in the Trump Presidential campaign. This sent the US dollar sharply lower against the yen, dragging on the Nikkei as well as pushing the euro above 1.1800 and the pound to a two week high above 1.3200. The pound is currently up 0.3% at $1.3229 and is up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1223. The dollar index \u2013 which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies - is down 0.2%.

      "bodyText": "Brexit Britain is proving a big visitor attraction: a record number of tourists arrived in the UK in August and they splashed out \u00a32.8bn, the highest monthly tourist spend ever. The number of visitors from the EU climbed 6% to 2.4m, helping to push the total number of overseas visitors arriving in the UK in August to 3.9m \u2013 up 5% on last year\u2019s levels. The Brexit vote, and the decline in the pound since then, has made the UK a far cheaper destination for overseas tourists, and driven a boom in bargain hunters from Europe, the US and China who want to snap up luxury leather goods and designer brands for lower prices than they can get at home. The UK countryside has not missed out either, with hotels in the Lake District enjoying a double-digit rise in bookings for July. Sites linked to popular books, films and TV programmes have also been pulling in the crowds. They include the Northern Ireland locations used in Game of Thrones, and events linked to the 20th anniversary of the first Harry Potter book and the 200th anniversary of the death of Jane Austen. However, the increase in foreign visitors in August failed to match the rise around the Easter period, when tourist numbers and the amount they spent was up 20% on the year before. The terror attacks in Manchester and London are thought to have deterred some potential overseas tourists, while the dollar has weakened from its position earlier in the year. VisitBritain, the tourism body, now forecasts that inbound visits to the UK will reach 39.7m by the end of this year, up nearly 6% on last year . They are expected to spend \u00a325.7bn, up 14% to a new high. Both numbers have been revised up since January. The tourism minister, John Glen, said: \u201cThese record-breaking figures for August reaffirm the UK\u2019s position as a global go-to destination and show the continued strength of the sector.\u201d The surge in numbers throughout the year has boosted Britain\u2019s tourism and services industries, just as uncertainty created by the EU referendum has damaged the confidence of UK consumers and businesses. The tourist boom drove strong sales for British luxury brands such as Burberry and has helped propel Bond Street in London into the top three of the world\u2019s most expensive store locations, overtaking Paris\u2019s Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. The economy has also been helped by the trend towards staycations, as the low pound has increased the cost of holidaying abroad. The VisitBritain director, Patricia Yates, said the tourist industry was expecting a bumper Christmas: \u201cWe are confident of a strong festive season and beyond as we showcase why our nations and regions should top people\u2019s list as the must-go-now destination.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Household finances are under worsening pressure, according to Nationwide building society, which reported a fall in profits and warned of tougher trading conditions ahead. Total mortgage lending slipped from \u00a317.5bn to \u00a316.7bn, largely because of a steep decline in loans for buy-to-let following the tax changes. But as lending for landlords has fallen, loans granted to first-time buyers have surged. Britain\u2019s biggest building society said it accounted for one in five of all mortgages given to first-time buyers, helping a record 39,500 young buyers on to the property ladder. However, its lending to landlords plummeted by 40% to \u00a31.7bn. Half-year profits at Nationwide fell to \u00a3588m from \u00a3615m, although the society said this was partly because of extraordinary items, and that underlying profitability was ahead. It said that future full-year profits will be in a lower range than previously thought, at \u00a3900m-\u00a31.3bn a year, partly because of the poorer outlook for the mortgage market and partly because as a mutual it wants to return gains to customers. The chief executive, Joe Garner, said that a \u201csluggish\u201d economy, partly a result of Brexit, weak wage growth and rising prices are straining its customers\u2019 finances. \u201cLooking ahead, the UK economy should continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate due to the uncertainties around Brexit. Despite the recent base rate rise, borrowing costs overall remain low. However, we know that low wage growth and inflation are putting pressure on household budgets and we remain alert to signs of financial strains on consumers,\u201d said Garner. Loan impairments \u2013 where customers have fallen behind with repayments \u2013 were up from \u00a337m to \u00a359m, but remain a tiny proportion of the society\u2019s total assets of \u00a3228bn. The society was ordered by banking regulators four years ago to plug a capital shortfall, but Garner said its capital position is now at an all-time high and significantly above other high street lenders. Once just a savings and loans provider, the society has emerged as one of the strongest players in current account banking. Garner said that over the past two years it has added 19% more current account customers, taking the total to 7.1m, and that it had taken more account switchers than the major banks combined. However, the society admitted that pricing pressures in mortgages and loans are intensely competitive, and that its market share is likely to decline over the next six months. The half-year results reveal just how dependent the society is on the London property market, although it said its exposure was in line with other lenders. It has lent nearly \u00a360bn to homeowners in the capital, compared to just \u00a316bn in the whole of Scotland and Wales, and \u00a322bn in the rest of the south east of England. Nationwide said house price growth had moderated to the 2% to 4% band in recent months, and that it expected the market to mirror the economy, \u201csluggish in the near term [but] our central expectation is that it will accelerate in the years ahead, once Brexit uncertainties recede\u201d. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The scandal at the 2 Sisters chicken factory should act as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to the UK food regulator which has presided over a system in which it is simple to \u201chide infractions,\u201d a report by a committee of MPs has found. The report, resulting from an inquiry called by the Commons\u2019 environment, food and rural affairs committee (Efra) in the wake of an undercover investigation by the Guardian and ITV News, also said that the problems identified at the site were \u201cnot a one-off\u201d at the company. MPs said they were \u201cconcerned at the apparent laxity of the oversight\u201d of the West Bromwich plant considering the history of the food processor. The report will be viewed as a scathing critique of the food safety inspection regime, which involves the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and local authorities assessing food production facilities alongside separate teams from private food standards schemes and the supermarkets. The committee recommended that these bodies should start pooling their intelligence, that the FSA\u2019s food crime unit should receive an increased budget and that compulsory CCTV monitoring of all meat-cutting plants should be considered. \u201cFor an industry which takes pride in the quality of its produce, we were surprised to hear of the apparently patchwork nature of the accreditation process,\u201d the MPs said. \u201cIt appears relatively simple for someone to game the system and hide infractions \u2013 by opting out of unannounced visits by the accreditors for example \u2013 and the lack of joined-up intelligence and knowledge-sharing seemingly presents many gaps into which misdemeanours can fall. \u201cWe trust that all accreditation firms, not just those who appeared before us, will use this incident as a wake-up call to tighten their processes and remove some of the more obvious loopholes.\u201d A spokesman for the FSA said: \u201cThe FSA welcomes the findings of the Efra select committee and will make a formal response in due course. We are continuing to investigate the allegations made by ITV and the Guardian concerning the 2 Sisters poultry plant in West Bromwich and will publish our findings when the work is completed.\u201d MPs began their inquiry after the Guardian and ITV News undercover footage showed workers altering the slaughter date of poultry processed at a plant in West Bromwich and returning chicken that had fallen on the floor to the production line. The group produces a third of all poultry products eaten in the UK and supplies supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer, Aldi and Lidl. All five began their own investigations and suspended deliveries from the factory, which was shut for five weeks to retrain staff. The site reopened at the start of this month following \u201csignificant changes\u201d at the facility and the introduction of full-time FSA officials to oversee its procedures. Of the five supermarket groups supplied by the site, only Sainsbury\u2019s is yet to recommence deliveries. The committee\u2019s report added: \u201cThe problems identified at the 2 Sisters plant at West Bromwich are not a one-off. The past record of the 2 Sisters Food Group is far from pristine and there are valid questions to be asked of its corporate governance structure. \u201cThat being the case, we are concerned at the apparent laxity of the oversight of the [West Bromwich] facility, an incredibly important part of the poultry food chain.\u201d However, the committee shied away from further direct criticism of the company saying: \u201cWe do not propose to examine in depth whether 2 Sisters has been in breach of food safety regulation or food hygiene best practice, neither will we suggest sanctions.\u201d A spokesman for 2 Sisters said: \u201cWe note the content of the report and look forward to updating the committee on progress in the new year.\u201d During the committee\u2019s hearings Ranjit Singh Boparan, the boss of 2 Sisters Food Group, apologised for the scandal but contested that altering the kill date labels was a breach of regulations, instead saying the workers were correcting erroneous slaughter dates. The worker shown changing the kill dates in the footage has been dismissed, after the company instigated disciplinary proceedings citing allegations he had breached food safety regulations. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "British shoppers are expected to spend \u00a310.1bn in the week of Black Friday, nearly 4% higher than last year as more retailers take part in the US-inspired promotional day. But the bargain fever seen in earlier years is thought unlikely to materialise as most activity will be online with experts warning that the discounts are likely to be less exciting on the day, which falls on 24 November this year. Companies are finding it harder to deliver big price cuts amid strong inflation partly resulting from the fall in the value of the pound since last year\u2019s Brexit vote, as well as rising business rates and other costs. \u201cIncreased cost prices will mean retailers are unable to offer the level of discounts advertised in 2016, meaning demand may waver as consumers feel less inclined to make bargain purchases on impulse,\u201d said Eleanor Parr at retail analysis firm GlobalData. Gary Caffell from the consumer advice sight Moneysavingexpert said it was possible to get a good deal but warned: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of duds out there so do your research. Just because something says it is 70% it doesn\u2019t mean it is a good deal. It might be cheaper down the road.\u201d Parr added that electrical products, usually the main focus of Black Friday discounts, were likely to be most affected by inflation with fashion and homewares also affected. The fashion market has also endured a tough October and the ongoing relatively warm weather is likely to encourage stores to try and use Black Friday as a way to reduce stocks of coats and other cold weather gear. Although Asda continues to play down Black Friday, with no special deals or activity planned on the day after tussles in a store three years ago, grocery discounter Lidl is joining the fray for the first time this year. Tesco is also ramping up activity with more than 700 stores participating and 187 of its largest outlets opening at 1am for bargain hunters. Amazon, which helped introduce Black Friday to the UK, kicks off its sale on Friday, but some online electrical stores \u2013 AO and rival Currys PC World \u2013 began offering discounts on Monday. Argos started on Wednesday. All are trying to avoid a big squeeze on their delivery and IT infrastructure by spreading demand over a longer period. Retailers have also invested heavily in improving their computing capabilities and delivery networks after 2015 when as many as one in five online retailer\u2019s websites crashed on Black Friday under the heavy traffic, including John Lewis, Boots and Argos. However, \u00a31.74m is expected to be spent every minute online in the UK on Black Friday, according to figures from online trade association IMRG and the couriers insurance firm Staveley Head, with \u00a3700m spent before 9am. Stavely Head predicts more than 82,000 vehicles will hit the road, with the top five delivery firms using nearly 20,000 extra vans and cars with more than 80% of Black Friday purchases delivered to homes.

      "bodyText": "The stock market, we are invited to believe, has been in a state of utter turmoil for the past few weeks. Fund managers have been hiding in bunkers, apparently, afraid to consider new investments. It\u2019s rubbish, of course, but that doesn\u2019t prevent every company that pulls its flotation, or IPO, from blaming the market. The latest is debt-collector Cabot Credit Management, a firm that buys portfolios of defaulting loans from banks, energy suppliers and retailers at a discount and then tries to collect the debts. Ken Stannard, chief executive, reports a \u201chigh level of engagement and interest\u201d from \u201ca wide array of investors\u201d but, oh dear, \u201cthe timing has been unfortunate with respect to IPO market conditions\u201d. Really? The FTSE 100 index is a mere 1.8% below its level on 20 October, the day Cabot announced its intention to float. That\u2019s nothing. A more plausible explanation for abandonment is that investors thought Cabot\u2019s owners \u2013 principally, a US debt management company called Encore and private equity firm JC Flowers \u2013 were asking too much. The reputed valuation was \u00a31bn. Investors were encouraged to question that figure by some admirably robust questioning from hedge funds. Step forward Bybrook Capital, which has been arguing loudly that the costs of chasing the debts of distressed borrowers are enormous, thus the cash flows for the collector aren\u2019t as juicy as they may appear. Bybrook may be talking its book, since it probably has short positions in other debt-collectors, but that\u2019s not a reason to ignore it. Recall that Lansdowne, another big London hedge fund, was short of Northern Rock\u2019s shares for years before the bank\u2019s collapse because it thought the business model was flawed. Cabot can hardly protest that it was friendless in the debate since it had five City firms working on its float, including the great houses of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Cabot\u2019s owners, if they wished, could also cut the price-tag to try to get the float away, just as ready-meal firm Bakkavor did last week. They didn\u2019t, which is their choice, but, please, spare us the bleat about \u201cmarket conditions\u201d. The story here seems simple: investors assessed the risks in the unlovely business of collecting debts and didn\u2019t like the price. We need to talk about Kevin They probably weren\u2019t in a mood for jokes in GKN\u2019s boardroom, but let\u2019s hope somebody used the obvious line: we need to talk about Kevin. In September, Kevin Cummings, head of the aerospace division, won the race to be GKN\u2019s next chief executive and was hailed as an \u201cexcellent\u201d successor to Nigel Stein. The promotion would take effect in January. Then came a small problem: last month\u2019s \u00a315m charge to cover a write-off of stock and receivables in an aerospace plant in Alabama. Now it\u2019s a big problem: GKN has looked at more of its US plants \u2013 making parts for Black Hawk helicopters \u2013 and confessed that a further charge of \u00a380m-\u00a3130m is needed. That sum is hard to skip over. It represents about 15% of inventories held by the aerospace division, a hefty proportion. GKN did not explain why Cummings, who had led the aerospace division since 2014, is leaving \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d, but reticence is easy to understand. Pay-off arrangements for a chief executive-designate who is ousted before he starts the job will be a legal minefield. Cummings\u2019 exit leaves GKN in a succession muddle. Anne Stevens, an ex-Ford veteran hauled from non-executive benches to be interim chief executive, is a useful stand-in. But a permanent replacement will probably come from outside and she or he will take time to arrive. In the meantime, excitable City analysts can forget any idea that GKN is about to demerge its aerospace division from its better-performing automotive business. Nothing will happen until the new boss arrives. That is probably a good thing: GKN is an engineer and there ought to be cross-over skills between cars and planes. The accounting episode puts a dent in Stein\u2019s successful leadership of GKN, but the recovery from the 2009 recession has still been impressive. Jolly good. Now, before you go, don\u2019t forget to explain to shareholders why the accounting controls in the US were so poor. Second thoughts needed over second referendum Does Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, think before he tweets? In his latest Brexit-related offering, Blankfein opined that chief executives in the UK are too afraid to say that a second referendum on leaving the European Union would be a good idea. \u201cSo much at stake, why not make sure consensus still there?\u201d he asked. It\u2019s a reasonable question, but, come on, few things are less likely to bring about a second referendum than public lobbying by the multimillionaire American boss of a US investment bank. The effort is bound to be counter-productive. Does that not cross his mind? Do none of his clever colleagues in London advise him to speak softly? Or does he just like the attention?",
