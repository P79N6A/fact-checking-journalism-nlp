The penalty, expected to be announced by the Financial Conduct Authority on Tuesday, will be the latest setback for the bank in its attempt to clean up its reputation in the wake of the 2012 Libor rigging scandal. The \u00a338m fine is the second punishment Barclays has received for breaches of client asset rules. It is bigger than the \u00a333m imposed on JP Morgan in 2010, when City regulators began focusing on client asset rules in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The unwinding of Lehman has proved more complex because its own assets were mixed up with those clients, making it more difficult to pay them back. Almost a dozen fines have been handed out for this breach of the rules, which in Barclays\u2019 case is thought to cover the period between 2007 and 2012. While this time frame predates the appointment of Antony Jenkins as chief executive, the latest punishment comes as he attempts to defend the bank against fraud charges in the US in relation to the sale of mortgage bonds and after a \u00a326m fine in May for fixing the gold price. There had been reports that the latest fine for Barclays could be as high as \u00a360m, which would have been on top of the \u00a31.1m it was fined in 2011 for failing to keep clients\u2019 money separate from its own. That penalty was levied on the investment banking arm of Barclays, which is also thought likely to receive the latest fine.

    "webTitle": "Minimum wage increase: will it really hurt the economy?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "To believe the reaction from some corners of the business world, you\u2019d think economic ruin was certain if the minimum wage was increased to \u00a38 an hour by 2020, as Labour leader Ed Miliband proposes. Let\u2019s crunch the numbers. The minimum wage will be \u00a36.50 an hour from next month. To get to \u00a38 by 2020 would require the compound annual increase to be 3.5% a year. True, that\u2019s more than twice the current level of inflation on the CPI measure. On the other hand, the economy is supposed to be so strong that the Bank of England is warming up for a rate hike. In that context, is 3.5% a year really so radical? Miliband\u2019s critics are on stronger ground in arguing that the Low Pay Commission is best left to get on with its job without interference from politicians. Each year the commission gathers evidence on what level of increase the economy can bear without destroying jobs. That is one reason why its recommendations tend to be accepted without (much) complaint from the business lobby. Yet Miliband is not the first politician to say what he thinks the commission should do. Remember this declaration in January? \u201cWhen I look at the British economy, I see the British economy expanding, I see jobs being created, I see the prospect of future jobs being created as well. I think Britain can afford a higher minimum wage.\u201d That was interpreted at the time as being support for a hike to \u00a37 an hour from October. The speaker was Chancellor George Osborne. Bramson v Electra Ding, ding! It\u2019s round two of the great Edward Bramson versus Electra Private Equity punch-up. Last week Bramson, the activist investor, threw a lot of punches but missed with his intended haymaker by failing to say how \u201cmore than\u201d \u00a31bn of value could be realised. That was a bad start for Bramson\u2019s attempt to get himself voted on to Electra\u2019s board. Now he is definitely on the back foot after the fund issued its precise point-by-point rebuttal yesterday. Far from underperforming on the FTSE 250 for seven years in a row, as Bramson\u2019s investment vehicle Sherbone had claimed, Electra says it has beaten the index in each of the last three. The dispute is technical but, to this observer, Bramson was indeed mixing annual returns and 10-year annualised returns in a spectacularly misleading manner. A commonsense view of Electra\u2019s performance is surely this: the fund aims for a 10%-15% return on equity a year and has achieved an average of 14% over the last decade. Yes, one can cut and dissect numbers over shorter periods and in different ways, but so what? Sherborne, with a 20% stake in Electra, is on stronger ground in complaining about the high fees Electra pays its investment manager, Electra Partners. Private equity managers should not be charging to sit on cash. They all do it \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t make it right. The question in front of shareholders, however, is whether Bramson, plus a sidekick from Sherborne, should be elected to the board. Electra argues their presence would be destabilising. It would, of course, but it has a point. Bramson presents himself as a cost-cutter extraordinaire, which could be a serious turn-off when Electra is pitching to buy private companies. Unless the activist can return with a clear statement of where the \u00a31bn of value is supposed to be, the shareholders should stick with the board they know when they vote on 6 October \u2013 then give the directors a hard time on fees. Addison value It is easy to understand why private equity titan Carlyle Group would wish to bank a big profit by selling Addison Lee only 18 months after buying the London minicab firm. But who would wish to buy in an age when Uber\u2019s smartphone app prowls the land? Uber has been seen primarily as a threat to London\u2019s black-cab drivers, who argue (legitimately in this column\u2019s view) that the app completely undermines well-established rules that give them a monopoly on carrying meters that calculate prices by time and distance. Yet, in the long term, Uber may offer more of a threat to the likes of Addison Lee than to the black cabs. Whatever else it might be, Uber offers a new form of competition. If it succeeds, it will do so by driving down fares. It\u2019s hard to spot the silver lining there for the established minicab operators. Carlyle paid \u00a3300m for a majority stake in Addison Lee in April last year, but the price tag is now said to be \u00a3800m. Really? An original bank The problem with \u201cchallenger\u201d banks, it is often said, is that they attract the most challenging customers \u2013 ie those who are happy to switch their current accounts for a year for \u00a3100, then depart in search of the next bung. Aldermore, coming to the stock market soon, doesn\u2019t quite fit this description, as it doesn\u2019t offer current accounts. Instead, it funds itself largely via online savings accounts for individuals and small businesses. Savers do not necessarily hang around longer, of course, but at least Aldermore\u2019s no-branches model has the virtue of simplicity. Among the crop of new banking arrivals, it looks genuinely different. That\u2019s a virtue. The puzzle is why it needs to float \u2013 the main backers seem happy to invest more.",

      "bodyText": "The City regulator is investigating a number of debt management firms and has warned the industry that it needs to do more to protect consumers in financial difficulty. The Financial Conduct Authority, which was given responsibility for the sector in April, issued its warning as it prepares to authorise up to 200 debt management firms from next month. The FCA did not specify how many firms and individuals are already under investigation when it gave its update on the status of companies that step in when customers are facing difficulty paying their bills. Two firms have already had their applications refused before the formal authorisation date and seven firms have had their bank accounts frozen to protect money from clients. Victoria Raffe, director of authorisations at the FCA, said: \u201cThese firms are advising consumers who have often reached rock bottom, so it\u2019s important that firms get it right. Many firms are falling well short of our expectations and they will need to raise their game if they want to continue operating\u201d. Debt management firms are paid a fee by customers in financial distress and act an intermediary by making payments for customers in line with their repayment plans. The regulator said it was concerned about the usefulness of advice that debt management firms give to their customers and wants to be certain that advice is not driven by bonuses or other incentives. It also wants fees charged to be clear and transparent. As it begins the process of granting formal authorisation to firms, the FCA has required seven firms to appoint \u201cskilled persons\u201d to conduct reviews of their operations. This is a formal process under the FCA rules which can be implemented by the regulator when it has concerns about operations. In May, the FCA announced that Debt Help &amp; Advice and First Step Finance had stopped trading and were in administration and urged an estimated 3,500 customers to stop payments to the Stockport-based firms. The authorisation of such firms was previously conducted by the Office of Fair Trading but under a change in the rules the FCA is now responsible for consumer credit. As a result the regulator has also taken control of regulation of pay day lenders and is proposing a cap on lending rates to try to ensure that anyone borrowing \u00a3100 will never pay back more than \u00a3200.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has suspended the head of its UK business and called in independent accountants and lawyers to investigate after discovering that its guidance to the City overstated expected first-half profits by about \u00a3250m. The supermarket group, led by chief executive Dave Lewis, has asked the accountancy firm Deloitte and legal advisers Freshfields to scrutinise the overestimate at its troubled UK food business. PwC are Tesco\u2019s usual auditors. The retailer has also contacted the Financial Conduct Authority, the City\u2019s chief regulator. Tesco shares fell almost 8% on Monday morning to an 11-year low of 212p, making them the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 index and wiping \u00a31.5bn off the retailer\u2019s market value. More than \u00a36bn has been wiped off share value since 21 July, when the previous chief executive, Phil Clark, was ousted. On 29 August, Tesco told investors to expect profits of about \u00a31.1bn for the six months to 23 August, down from \u00a31.6bn a year earlier. However, the discovery of the overstatement of revenue paid to Tesco by its suppliers means the supermarket\u2019s first-half profit will now almost halve to about \u00a3850m. Lewis, who joined three weeks ago after 27 years at Unilever, said he had never seen revenue accounted for in this way. \u201cCertainly not in my Unilever career,\u201d he said. Lewis said four top managers had stepped aside from their jobs while the investigation took place. Chris Bush, the company\u2019s UK managing director, is understood to have been replaced by Robin Terrell, Tesco\u2019s multichannel director. The overstatement was discovered when a whistleblower alerted Tesco\u2019s general counsel on Friday afternoon. Lewis said the general counsel then informed him and Tesco spent the weekend scrutinising the food business. He said the problem was not in the ordinary course of events and that rules may have been broken. \u201cWe have asked four people, senior people, to step aside. That is across commercial and business operations. \u201cWe are clear there is an issue here. We will let the investigation determine whether any rules were broken and what I need to do to address that.\u201d Analysts pressed Tesco\u2019s chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, about how the accounting problem went undiscovered until just over a week before the planned announcement of first-half results. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Broadbent\u2019s position was untenable because he had left the board without a finance director. Tesco recruited Alan Stewart from Marks &amp; Spencer as its new finance director in July, but he is not due to start until December. His predecessor, Laurie McIlwee, resigned and left the board in April, but agreed to stay on to hand over. Black said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a total failure of governance. The finance director announced he was going in April. For a period they\u2019ve been rudderless in that respect.\u201d Broadbent said McIlwee had not been involved in \u201crecent days and weeks\u201d and that the finance operation had carried on effectively without him. He declined to say when McIlwee was last in the office. He denied that the board should have been expected to spot the problem and said it had stepped up scrutiny of commercial revenue, including payments by suppliers for instore promotions. \u201cAt the end of last year after looking carefully at it, it was signed off by external auditors.\u201d While PwC remained Tesco\u2019s auditor, Deloitte had been called in to make an independent judgment, he said. The accounting problem has forced Tesco to delay its first-half results from 1 October to 23 October. It is the latest blow to Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket group,. Broadbent said Clarke was involved up until his last day on 1 September. Asked if the company will seek to reclaim bonuses from executives due to the overstatement, he said the board would take \u201call necessary actions\u201d. Last month, unveiling its second profit warning in two months, the retailer said it would be slashing its half-year dividend by 75% and that full-year profits would be \u00a32.4bn to \u00a32.5bn, down from its previous forecast of \u00a32.8bn. Last year, the group posted profits of \u00a33.3bn. Who are the suspended executives? Chris Bush, managing director, Tesco UK Bush, 47, joined the company in 1982 and spent more than a decade as UK store director before stints heading Tesco in South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. He returned to the UK as chief operating officer in 2012 and was promoted to the top job in the UK, where the company makes 70% of its sales, in January 2013. Bush says the best piece of advice he has ever been given is: \u201cFocus on doing your very best in the job you have and your career will look after itself.\u201d Carl Rogberg, UK finance director Rogberg worked for Kraft between 1992 and 2000 before co-founding the mobile payments company Mint. In 2004 he went to work for the foreign study company Education First in Hong Kong. He began his career at Tesco as international finance director for Asia in 2006, moving to Thailand to be finance director of Tesco Lotus, where he worked for Chris Bush. John Scouler, commercial director A sporadic tweeter and Newcastle United fan, Scouler joined Tesco in 2002, rising to become commercial director in Hungary before returning to the UK as director of packaged foods in 2010. In 2012 he became UK commercial director in charge of all household, healthcare, baby and beauty products as well as packaged food, beer, wine and spirits, petrol and tobacco products. In a Grocer story on his 2012 promotion, he was described as a \u201cpersuasive operator with a good understanding of the supplier side\u201d. Matt Simister, responsible for group sourcing Simister was described as a \u201cTesco rising star\u201d by Retail Week in 2012, for his work setting up the sourcing division \u201cto leverage global scale and create efficient supply chains\u201d. A business and marketing graduate from the University of Sheffield, Simister has worked as Tesco\u2019s head of meat, fish and poultry and DIY, household and home utilities. He also spent three years as head of operations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. He hit the headlines in 2013 when he blamed Tesco\u2019s customers and suppliers for wasting almost 60,000 tonnes of food a year.",

      "bodyText": "At the end of year assembly, Ashley Terron\u2019s teacher pulled him to one side in a last-ditch attempt to persuade him to stay on to do A-levels. Terron was a good pupil and his school saw a path to university ahead. The 16-year-old, however, had other ideas. Like his great-grandfather, father and older brother, he wanted to become a bricklayer. Now 22, he is officially the best young bricklayer in the world, having taken home a gold medal for the UK at last year\u2019s WorldSkills competition. Ask most British builders about the country\u2019s bricklaying excellence though, and they will probably tell you good tradespeople are as rare as their expertise. The latest figures showing rising employment and falling benefit claims in the UK also shed more light on what construction industry insiders have described as a \u201cskills timebomb\u201d. The official data showed the number of bricklayers claiming job seeker\u2019s allowance had dropped to its lowest level in at least a decade, down sharply to 1,775 in August from a peak of 15,425 in March 2009. They also showed construction wages up an annual 4% in July. That makes it one of the strongest performing sectors for pay growth, while in the wider economy wages are failing to match inflation. The numbers reflect the rise in work for an industry that shed many skilled workers during the savage recession. The economic crisis hit builders particularly hard as projects were cancelled and new work dried up. The sector lost almost 400,000 people and another 400,000 are due to retire over the next five years, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB). Now, as builders take on new work, the shortage of skilled tradespeople has allowed bricklayers and other subcontractors to ramp up their hourly rates. \u201cThere is good money for bricklaying out there to be earned,\u201d says Terron. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly one of the best times to get into it. The numbers are so low. It\u2019s three years of training and not great money, but after that it\u2019s a good career.\u201d Terron started out as an apprentice with his father, got into skills competitions and was picked out to represent the UK. He trained for more than two years for the WorldSkills contest in Leipzig, where he competed with bricklayers from 25 countries to build three complex models in 22 hours. Industry insiders hope interest in such competitions will help draw more young people into construction, and cut youth unemployment at the same time. \u201cPeople need to see training is available,\u201d says Ross Maloney, the chief executive of Find a Future, which runs the annual Skills Show event in Birmingham and manages the WorldSkills UK competitions. He believes giving young people a chance to try skilled jobs, whether it be as a confectioner or carpenter, fills a need not addressed in many schools. \u201cWe make sure there is a career path they can see,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are saying let\u2019s stop this conversation about qualifications and talk about jobs and careers.\u201d As part of that push for vocational training to gain the same attention as university degrees, the shows also run events for teachers and parents. The latest figures suggest that there is plenty more work to do. The number of apprenticeship starts in construction fell for the last full year for which numbers are available, down to 13,730 in 2012/2013 from 13,920 in 2011/12. Demand is only part of the problem. Research for the examiner City &amp; Guilds conducted last November found that more than 50% of construction businesses in the UK had no plans to take on apprentices over the coming year. Two-fifths did not employ any apprentices and 61% had not offered any unpaid work experience in the past 12 months. Steve Radley, the CITB\u2019s policy director, says employers need to capitalise on the upturn and help drive up the number of skilled workers. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious and developing skills shortage, and industry has come out of one of the most serious downturns it has seen for a century,\u201d he says. \u201cThe swing from bust to boom has been stronger than elsewhere, and industry has not traditionally planned ahead well.\u201d Radley is optimistic, however, that planning weakness could change. \u201cWe do feel like we have got a lot more visibility about infrastructure projects such as Crossrail, and that allows industry to plan ahead.\u201d Michael Osbaldeston from City &amp; Guilds puts some of the shortage of young people down to patchy careers advice in schools. \u201cIt\u2019s true that lots of people are pointed down the academic route when that is not necessarily appropriate,\u201d he says, noting that many people start apprenticeships in construction several years after school. \u201cThey need to be advised or guided to these areas earlier, like at 14 or 16,\u201d he says. It may have to be even sooner, says David McCay, a tiling lecturer at North West Regional College in Northern Ireland. McCay, who volunteers with the UK squad for skills competitions, sees a big opportunity for construction companies to attract primary school pupils, who always respond well to building demonstrations. \u201cIf you ask a primary school child: \u2018Who wants a go?\u2019 \u2013 you have 20 hands go up. If you go into secondary schools they are too cool and have inhibitions,\u201d he says. His college has no trainee bricklayers among new students this new academic year. \u201cThere is no interest in the young people in bricklaying because of parents\u2019 attitudes to the construction industry,\u201d McCay says. \u201cSchools focus on maths and literacy and that\u2019s hugely important \u2026 but they have put vocational paths to one side. Schools need to be more understanding of the trades.\u201d Terron agrees that schools need to understand the variety of routes into work. He has gone on to an assistant site management job at the housebuilder Redrow and is studying for a degree in construction project management, so when it comes to his own school he feels vindicated. The newly crowned world champion got in touch with his old teacher. \u201cI still remembered him and I had to get this off my chest \u2026 He said he felt an enormous sense of pride \u2013 and he apologised,\u201d he says.",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares suffered their biggest one day fall since early July, as <strong>Tesco</strong> issued a shock admission it had overstated its profits, and Chinese growth fears undermined commodity companies.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong>, which had edged higher at the end of last week on relief over the no vote in the Scottish referendum, went sharply into reverse, closing down 64.29 points or nearly 1% lower at 6773.63. That was the biggest one day points fall since 8 July, when the index lost 85 points.</p> <p>Tesco, down 26.6p or 11.5% at 203p, accounted for nearly 9 points of the index decline. The supermarket shook investors' nerves after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/22/tesco-investigators-overstating-profit-250m\" title=\"\">it suspended four senior executives and called in investigators in the wake of overstating profits by \u00a3250m</a>.</p> <p>Rival supermarkets were caught up in the backlash against Tesco. J Sainsbury slipped 5.5p to 278.8p and Morrisons dipped 3p to 179p. Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research said:</p> <blockquote> Markets are likely to do a read across to the other retailers in the UK. However these types of practices are most likely to occur when profits are continuously sliding down and people try to minimise the bad news. This is not the case for Sainsbury's.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares suffered their biggest one day fall since early July, as Tesco issued a shock admission it had overstated its profits, and Chinese growth fears undermined commodity companies. The FTSE 100, which had edged higher at the end of last week on relief over the no vote in the Scottish referendum, went sharply into reverse, closing down 64.29 points or nearly 1% lower at 6773.63. That was the biggest one day points fall since 8 July, when the index lost 85 points. Tesco, down 26.6p or 11.5% at 203p, accounted for nearly 9 points of the index decline. The supermarket shook investors' nerves after it suspended four senior executives and called in investigators in the wake of overstating profits by \u00a3250m. Rival supermarkets were caught up in the backlash against Tesco. J Sainsbury slipped 5.5p to 278.8p and Morrisons dipped 3p to 179p. Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein Research said: Markets are likely to do a read across to the other retailers in the UK. However these types of practices are most likely to occur when profits are continuously sliding down and people try to minimise the bad news. This is not the case for Sainsbury's. While that is arguably the case for Morrisons, they have always had a much more conservative approach to their accounts. Elsewhere, worries about a slowdown in China - a key consumer of commodities - left metal prices lower and hit the mining sector. There were concerns that Tuesday's initial manufacturing index for the month could conceivably dip below 50, signalling contraction.

The revelation of a \u00a3250m \u201coverstatement\u201d in half-year profits forecasts was understandably short on detail but any warning that relates to when income is recognised tends to be toxic for a company\u2019s reputation. For retailers that take up-front promotional payments from suppliers, this is basic accounting territory. Accounting rules allow for some interpretation but when the figure at dispute is \u00a3250m \u2013 or almost a quarter of the \u00a31.1bn of profit that Tesco was expecting to make in the first half of its financial year \u2013 it\u2019s hard to imagine a benign explanation. New chief executive Dave Lewis, fresh from Unilever, implied as much by referring to the importance of \u201cintegrity and transparency\u201d. Note, too, that the figure is an early estimate, established only through a fast and furious probe over the weekend after a whistleblower dropped the bombshell on Friday. The final outcome, once accountants Deloitte and lawyers Freshfields have finished their work, could be higher. Nor do shareholders know if the overstatement is confined to the current trading years. Has this been going on for ages? And, if Tesco\u2019s financial controls were so lax, will the full investigation uncover issues beyond the recognition of income and the allocation of costs? Four executives have been suspended and all are senior Tesco figures. Chris Bush, managing director of the UK, is the most important executive outside the boardroom.

Names such as Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Money, the RAC and shoe company Jimmy Choo are also being cited as potential floats but Aldermore reacted quickest on Monday with its plans to raise \u00a375m of new funds and sell off an existing stake in the business. City experts have said flotations had been delayed by the uncertainty caused by last week\u2019s Scottish independence referendum and unfounded fears that it would produce a vote in favour of a breakaway. Phillip Monks, the Aldermore chief executive, who along with other management owns 2% of the business, said the flotation was necessary to continue growth in lending activities such as asset finance and lending to small businesses and for home loans. \u201cWe want to be able to grow at the phenomenal rate we have been,\u201d said Monks, a former head of corporate banking at Barclays who joined Aldermore in 2009. Aldermore is often described as \u201cchallenger\u201d bank although Monks disagreed with this monicker as the bank has been in existence for five years, although said he was \u201cchallenging the incumbent\u201d in lending. \u201cWhere the focus of politicians is in terms of the retail space and freeing up the payments systems we\u2019re not involved in that,\u201d he added. Aldermore does not have any branches and largely funds its lending through online savings accounts for individuals and small businesses. The intention to float was announced alongside half-year profits which showed a rise from \u00a35.3m to \u00a318.6m. Monks said Aldermore had no intention of expanding into current accounts \u2013 a market facing an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority \u2013 and would remain focused on its existing lending operations. Existing hedge fund backers Lansdowne and Toscafund, chaired by former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, Sir George Mathewson, intend to increase their combined stake of 8.3% through the float. But AnaCap, the private equity backer, is selling down some of its holding. There will not be a dividend until at least 2017 as Monks intends to plough money back into the business. It intends to run a core-tier one-capital ratio \u2013 a key measure of financial strength \u2013 of 13%, more than the regulatory minimum. The flotation is scheduled for next month and comes after OneSavingsBank \u2013 the former Kent Reliance Building Society \u2013 announced its flotation in May and Lloyds Banking Group began the process of selling off TSB.

We estimate that WH Smith Local currently generates no earnings. However, with 15 trial stores due to be open by 2014 year-end, we demonstrate that 200 stores (compared with around 20,000 newsagents in the UK) could generate \u00a32.4m of earnings. This assumes revenue per store at an 80% discount versus a typical High Street store.  For International, we estimate that the division will generate around \u00a32m of earnings in 2014. However, with 118 stores now open we believe that earnings will grow to \u00a39m by 2017 as store productivity builds and 30-40 new stores are added each year.  Finally, we estimate that Funkypigeon will generate around \u00a32m of EBITDA in 2014, lower than market leader Moonpig (\u00a314m of EBITDA) despite having revenues of \u00a313m in 2014, around 25% of the level of Moonpig. Applying Moonpig's EBITDA margins of 26% to Funkypigeon's 2014 estimated revenue implies EBITDA of \u00a33.5m. According to press reports, Photobox, which is Moonpig's parent company, was considering an IPO that could have valued the business at \u00a3400m-\u00a3500m (source: Daily Telegraph) or a 2014 enterprise value/EBITDA of 20-25 times.

Fowler, a fashion designer, was frustrated with the industry: she felt there was a shortfall of factual data and, too often, decision-making was based on \u201cthe way the wind was blowing, rather than any real hard solid metrics\u201d, resulting in key commercial opportunities slipping by. Watts was working for a big dairy company at the time: \u201cI said to Julia, \u2018This is not how we do things in the dairy industry. We\u2019ve got a lot of metrics \u2026 we know how much milk each cow is producing.\u2019\u201d Using Fowler\u2019s understanding of the fashion world and Watts\u2019s experience as a developer, the couple co-founded Editd, a retail technology company that offers brands not just insights into how the industry is moving, but data to monitor and compare how they and their competitors are performing. If a competitor introduces a product from a brand you care about, an email pings straight into your inbox, says Watts. Stock movements are captured so that retailers have the information they need to \u201chave the right product at the right price at the right time\u201d. Editd is used mostly by retail buyers, traders and merchandisers \u2013 clients include Gap, Asos, Gilt Groupe, Harvey Nichols and Debenhams. Earlier this year Asos, one of Editd\u2019s first customers, attributed a 37% revenue increase in the last quarter of 2013 to its data insights, which helped structure Asos\u2019s pricing competitively. \u201cI wanted to build a product like this because in my [former] job we would have information about our own products \u2026 but we never knew if we were missing out on an opportunity that we\u2019d never tried,\u201d Fowler explains. They moved to the UK in 2007, to London. \u201cWe felt that London had more a cutting-edge retail environment,\u201d adds Watts. \u201cIf you think about all the value that has been created in fashion, I think London is the Silicon Valley of the world.\u201d Leaning over the laptop, they demonstrate in a few simple clicks the types of insights their customers glean from using the dashboard, which slices up the data that has been gathered using a combination of web crawlers and information provided by retailers. Adjust a few measures and you have a comparison of how much biker jackets are selling for by retailer, and how yours fares against the average price. \u201cIf you look at retailers now,\u201d says Fowler, \u201conline or in-store they\u2019re having new products delivered every week, almost every day, so the need for having better information about what you\u2019re going to order is huge.\u201d Production and manufacturing processes have been a big contributor to the change in speedy decisions and fast turnarounds. \u201cSome of our customers can now move from concept to in-store in three weeks,\u201d Fowler says. Watts chips in: \u201cLess than that [sometimes].\u201d Fowler also points to advances in technology and the uptake in digital as fuelling the need for an abundance of information in order to stay ahead of the market. She references brands that have used \u201cbuy-it-now\u201d buttons during live streams of fashion shows and the proliferation of online-only stores. And, she says, \u201cTrends will emerge from someone wearing something cool on Instagram; people will want to copy it [and] people need to bring a product to market instantly to address that demand.\u201d Editd\u2019s co-founders are flying to the US next week, to begin recruiting staff for their new New York office. Earlier this year, Editd raised $4.4m from Index Ventures and Frog Capital, and their team of 28 is about to recruit four more people.

From today, the Mint's vault service will allow anyone to trade gold and silver coins via its website. The Mint is hoping to cash in on interest in investing in gold by making it as easy as putting money in a savings account. The World Gold Council has suggested there is a potential \u00a34bn latent demand for gold investment within the UK. The Mint's trading website will provide constantly updated live prices for gold and silver. It said customers would be able to buy at the best possible price \"quickly, and securely, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year\". The Mint will also give customers a quote to buy back coins bought from its website and stored in its vaults. Consumers can buy just one silver Britannia coin, worth about \u00a319.50, but will have to store it themselves, as they would if they bought a 22-carat gold sovereign. Those wanting to keep their investment in the Mint's vaults will have to buy at least 25 gold sovereigns \u2013 worth about \u00a34,700. The mint will charge 1% of the value of your gold per year for storage, plus VAT. There is no maximum purchase limit. Shane Bissett, the Mint's director of commemorative coin and bullion, said: \"We want to help expand the bullion market in the UK, particularly as coins offer a relatively affordable introduction. The Royal Mint is responsible for manufacturing all UK coinage and has long been trusted with the currencies of other countries too, supplying to more than 60 worldwide. The quality of our bullion coins is of an extremely high standard which cannot be rivalled. We have been a highly respected and trusted source of coins for kings, queens and governments for over 1,000 years, and this proud heritage is means that we are globally recognised as a reliable source for bullion coins.\" Those looking to invest will want to keep a close eye on the gold price, which after a decade of incredible growth peaked at $1,883/ounce in August 2011. Since then the price has fallen by about a third, to $1,220/oz. Sales of Royal Mint gold bullion coins increased after they were awarded VAT-free status. Britannia, Sovereign and Lunar bullion coins are also Capital Gains Tax free for UK residents as they are still considered to be legal tender.",
