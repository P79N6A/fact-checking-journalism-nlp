    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\"It's a cathedral \u2026 an engineer's bloody dream, this place,\" said Nigel Staves, proudly pointing towards grey outlines more than 100ft above us in the cavernous dark. These are no hallowed carvings or stained glass but vents in a maze of dusty pipework where 140 tonnes of pulverised wood could be injected every hour into the huge boiler \u2013 in which we are standing. Staves, the manager at Tilbury power station on the banks of the river Thames, can make this emotional tour of the bowels of his workplace because it ceased operation a few days before. Although few in public life may have paid much heed to this giant Essex engine over the years, this is no ordinary closure. Tilbury claimed latterly to be the biggest biomass plant in the world, providing 10% of Britain's renewable power, and was a pioneer in the field of low-carbon generation. But the RWE Npower-owned electricity generator has failed to qualify for government incentives to burn wood instead of coal and has been forced into inaction. Now facing an unexpected retirement after 13 years as Tilbury's boss, to say that Staves, 63, is upset would be an understatement. \"I can't rest easy with this. It's a bit like an unexplained death in the family. It's ridiculous but it [the power station] is like a living thing to me and I can't understand the country turning its back on it,\" he said. \"I am not the greenest person \u2013 coal is king for me in many ways \u2013 but we have pioneered biomass here over the last two years and are now left with this [closure]. It's incomprehensible.\" Jackie Doyle-Price, the Conservative MP for Thurrock, is equally angry and has been fighting with the Department of Energy and Climate Change. \"There was so much excitement and pride here about all that was being done, it's like two fingers have been stuck up in our face. If we need to keep the lights on in Britain then we should be doing all we can to get new investment,\" she said. RWE is estimated to need around \u00a3450m to turn Tilbury into a full-time wood-burning plant. It made the switch from coal to biomass in 2011 but needs to make much wider changes to the plant if it is to operate for the next decade. Staves says new investors were ready alongside RWE \u2013 but only if Tilbury was eligible for the new \"contracts for difference\" subsidies that are being given to Drax in North Yorkshire and other rivals moving into biomass. This has not happened because of an over-legalistic interpretation of the new policy, says Doyle-Price, even though Tilbury was given subsidies through the renewable obligation certificate scheme in the past. A Decc spokesperson said plants which had already been receiving support as biomass conversions under one subsidy regime were not eligible to switch to the contract for difference, but added: \"The decision to close Tilbury is a commercial one taken by RWE and we respect that judgment.\" At a time when people are talking about the lights going out, the Essex plant is not the only closure in Britain. This year, RWE has shut the 2,000MW coal-fired plant at Didcot, in Oxfordshire, and the similarly sized oil-fired facility at Fawley, in Hampshire. Another of the big six energy groups, E.ON, has shut Kingsnorth, in Kent, while Scottish Power has closed Cockenzie, in East Lothian. SSE is expected to cease operations at Ferrybridge, in West Yorkshire, within 18 months. The end to coal-burning has been expected as tough new European Union anti-pollution legislation known as the Large Combustion Plant Directive would have demanded the fitting of expensive desulphurisation equipment or forced closure by 31 December 2015. Other energy generators have also closed their coal-fired plants, although many have been running their facilities flat out prior to the cut-off date \u2013 encouraged by cheap fuel imports from the US. The American shale gas revolution has forced low-priced coal out of its home market \u2013 in the process making burning gas in Britain the relatively more expensive option. That has had the unexpected result of encouraging utilities in the UK to mothball or shut down their gas-fired boilers. RWE has stalled plans to construct a new 2,400MW gas-fired plant at Willington, in Derbyshire, while Centrica and GDF Suez have both scaled back their capacity. The coal closure programme was largely expected \u2013 not so the gas \u2013 but it was meant to be substituted by \u00a3100bn of new investment in lower carbon substitutes such as nuclear and wind. The closure programme is ahead of schedule while the opening programme is at least three years behind withonshore wind projects stuck in planning, offshore wind slow to develop and atomic power more expensive than expected. RWE has been building large windfarms such as the Greater Gabbard, off Suffolk, while Drax is committed to its own \u00a3700m conversion from coal to biomass in North Yorkshire. But talks between the government and EDF over a first new atomic plant in Britain for 30 years at Hinkley Point, in Somerset, continue to drag on. All of this caused energy regulator Ofgem to warn in June that the chances of the lights going out by 2015 had risen dramatically over the course of the last year and action was needed. Yet most of the big six - fined by the regulator for mis-selling and other abuses while being pilloried by some politicians for alleged profiteering in the past - are pulling back for both internal and market reasons. A company like RWE might in the past have considered funding a new Tilbury biomass plant out of its own finances but now would need to borrow, at a time when its share price has plummeted. Fellow German utility E.ON has seen its market capitalisation fall from a peak of \u20ac105bn (\u00a390bn) a few years ago to \u20ac26bn, while EDF of France \u2013 another main player in the UK \u2013 has seen its value fall from \u20ac150bn in 2007 to barely \u20ac30bn today. The phasing out of nuclear in Germany plus the success of government-supported solar there has sent the local price of unsubsidised wholesale power plunging and badly undermined RWE and E.ON. EDF has suffered from a different set of problems with cost overruns and investments turned sour, and is tottering under more than \u00a330bn of debt. British energy policy is seen in the City as complex and unattractive to new investment. Peter Atherton, utility analyst with Liberum Capital, says the reason ministers are running round Qatar and Beijing trying to raise funds is because local investors have given coalition policies the thumbs down. \"They [ministers] should be asking themselves why this is, and changing their policies instead of trying to attract money from further afield,\" said Atherton. \"The fact is UK energy policy is not plausible. It has a trilemma of trying to provide energy security, affordability and decarbonisation all at the same time in a very short time frame. Something needs to change.\" Staves and his 200 directly employed staff are no doubt praying for Decc to come to a similar conclusion and save their low-carbon cathedral. Low-carbon options Biomass The government is supporting conversions of some, but not all, big coal plants to wood-burning such as Drax in North Yorkshire, but overall industry progress is slow. Ministers have become lukewarm about new biomass plants unless they generate heat as well as power. Wind Still seen as Britain's best bet but progress is slower than hoped. Onshore wind farms have faced growing opposition from local planners and the emphasis has moved offshore. North Sea installations are expensive and there is a desperate drive by operators to reduce costs. Solar After a bright start the solar sector has seen its subsidy levels reduced and activity has fallen. Some industrial-scale \"arrays\" continue to be built but expectations have fallen. Nuclear Negotiations continue between EDF and the government over a subsidy regime that would trigger the first newbuild in 30 years \u2013 at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Hitachi and others are still in the running for other new plants but the overall industry timetable has slipped drastically.",

    "webTitle": "Comet to make a high street comeback", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The collapsed electrical retailer Comet is to make a remarkable high street comeback, with up to 80 stores opening in the next two years. Southampton-based property tycoon Clive Coombes, who tried unsuccessfully to buy the business from administrators when it went bust in January, said his first store, renamed Meridian Comet, will open in the south-west by October. He attacked administrators Deloitte \u2013 which declined to comment \u2013 for failing to endorse his initial bids, claiming they were only interested in raising money. The resurrection of the 79-year-old retailer comes as its former private equity owner, OpCapita, was revealed to have already recouped at least \u00a354m from Comet's collapse, which left 6,600 staff unemployed after the closure of 230 stores. Retail analysts have questioned the relaunch, suggesting the new plans were deeply flawed and branding the website launched by Coombes to attract new investors \"incoherent\" and \"a joke\". Coombes wrote: \"When the liquidators where [sic] called in to take control of the ailing group he [Coombes] was disgusted not least of all at the loss of several thousand jobs, but that a business with such a healthy turnover from prime sites all over the UK, could ever run out of cash assuming that it had been run in a correct and proper manner.\" He said the administrators were \"only interested in the money they could raise by whatever method they deemed necessary\". The new venture aims to raise funds from individuals rather than through banks, with the hope of listing the business on the junior Aim stock market. Coombes said the new stores would carry minimal stock and orders would be dispatched centrally, with 60-minute free delivery slots for in-store and phone orders. There are no plans for a website. He told trade magazine Retail Week: \"Comet left a big gap in the market. Dixons is the only significant player in that market and we have identified a niche we're confident of making the most of.\" Experts and commentators were less sure of success for a new high street electrical retailer. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analyst Conlumino, said: \"All credit to someone trying to do something creative, but the truth is the electrical market has very little growth, very low margins and is extremely competitive. When Comet collapsed it was because the market was already saturated, so it doesn't need another player. \"The whole proposition doesn't stack up either. If someone came in with something innovative then maybe there is potential, but there is nothing new. \"The website comes across as a bit of a joke. He needs to show he is serious and it doesn't look very good with players like John Lewis who don't get even an apostrophe out of place. It gives the impression it is incoherent and has not been thought through.\" Since the collapse Dixons, which trades as Currys and PC World, has said it took 30% of the market share left by Comet. Matthew Rubin at retail analysts Verdict said he believes some of the plans have merit, including the sale of white goods and the offer of free delivery. But he warned that few are mourning the loss of Comet and to ignore online is doomed to failure. \"With 'old fashioned' retailing and plans to avoid the multi-channel approach altogether, Mr Coombes appears to have overlooked where real market growth is coming from.\" Meanwhile, new documents filed with Companies House show previous owners OpCapita has received \u00a354m from the collapse. OpCapita could be in line for further payouts, with \u00a329m cash yet to be distributed. The episode is under investigation by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for possible malpractice that led to the collapse, after the taxpayer was left with a \u00a323.2m redundancy bill. The government lost \u00a350m as an unsecured creditor, receiving less than 1p for every \u00a31 owed. Administrator Deloitte has been paid \u00a310m in fees, while insolvency adviser GA Europe has earned \u00a37m. Back from the brink Peter Jones, of Dragons' Den fame, ploughed \u00a35m of his \u00a3475m fortune into collapsed camera chain Jessops, relaunching 30 stores and re-employing 300 former staff members. He revamped the stores and improved the brand's online offer after some staff blamed the demise on customers flocking to online retailers such as Amazon instead. HMV was also saved from the brink by private equity firm Hilco, which slimmed down the estate to 141 stores in a \u00a350m deal after the company went bust in January.

      "body": "<p>The collapsed electrical retailer Comet is to make a remarkable high street comeback, with up to 80 stores opening in the next two years.</p> <p>Southampton-based property tycoon Clive Coombes, who tried unsuccessfully to buy the business from administrators when it went bust in January, said his first store, renamed Meridian Comet, will open in the south-west by October.</p> <p>He attacked administrators Deloitte \u2013 which declined to comment \u2013 for failing to endorse his initial bids, claiming they were only interested in raising money.</p> <p>The resurrection of the 79-year-old retailer comes as its former private equity owner, OpCapita, was revealed to have already recouped at least \u00a354m from Comet's collapse, which left 6,600 staff unemployed after the closure of 230 stores.</p> <p>Retail analysts have questioned the relaunch, suggesting the new plans were deeply flawed and branding the website launched by Coombes to attract new investors \"incoherent\" and \"a joke\".</p> <p>Coombes wrote: \"When the liquidators where [sic] called in to take control of the ailing group he [Coombes] was disgusted not least of all at the loss of several thousand jobs, but that a business with such a healthy turnover from prime sites all over the UK, could ever run out of cash assuming that it had been run in a correct and proper manner.\" He said the administrators were \"only interested in the money they could raise by whatever method they deemed necessary\".</p> <p>The new venture aims to raise funds from individuals rather than through banks, with the hope of listing the business on the junior Aim stock market.</p> <p>Coombes said the new stores would carry minimal stock and orders would be dispatched centrally, with 60-minute free delivery slots for in-store and phone orders. There are no plans for a website.</p> <p>He told trade magazine Retail Week: \"Comet left a big gap in the market. Dixons is the only significant player in that market and we have identified a niche we're confident of making the most of.\"</p> <p>Experts and commentators were less sure of success for a new high street electrical retailer. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analyst Conlumino, said: \"All credit to someone trying to do something creative, but the truth is the electrical market has very little growth, very low margins and is extremely competitive. When Comet collapsed it was because the market was already saturated, so it doesn't need another player.</p> <p>\"The whole proposition doesn't stack up either. If someone came in with something innovative then maybe there is potential, but there is nothing new.</p> <p>\"The website comes across as a bit of a joke. He needs to show he is serious and it doesn't look very good with players like John Lewis who don't get even an apostrophe out of place. It gives the impression it is incoherent and has not been thought through.\"</p> <p>Since the collapse Dixons, which trades as Currys and PC World, has said it took 30% of the market share left by Comet.</p> <p>Matthew Rubin at retail analysts Verdict said he believes some of the plans have merit, including the sale of white goods and the offer of free delivery. But he warned that few are mourning the loss of Comet and to ignore online is doomed to failure. \"With 'old fashioned' retailing and plans to avoid the multi-channel approach altogether, Mr Coombes appears to have overlooked where real market growth is coming from.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, new documents filed with Companies House show previous owners OpCapita has received \u00a354m from the collapse. OpCapita could be in line for further payouts, with \u00a329m cash yet to be distributed.</p> <p>The episode is under investigation by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for possible malpractice that led to the collapse, after the taxpayer was left with a \u00a323.2m redundancy bill. The government lost \u00a350m as an unsecured creditor, receiving less than 1p for every \u00a31 owed.</p> <p>Administrator Deloitte has been paid \u00a310m in fees, while insolvency adviser GA Europe has earned \u00a37m.</p> <h2>Back from the brink</h2> <p>Peter Jones, of Dragons' Den fame, ploughed \u00a35m of his \u00a3475m fortune into collapsed camera chain <strong>Jessops</strong>, relaunching 30 stores and re-employing 300 former staff members. He revamped the stores and improved the brand's online offer after some staff blamed the demise on customers flocking to online retailers such as Amazon instead.</p> <p><strong>HMV</strong> was also saved from the brink by private equity firm Hilco, which slimmed down the estate to 141 stores in a \u00a350m deal after the company went bust in January.

      "bodyText": "For smartphone users in China, an Apple is less tempting than Small Rice. That is the translation of Xiaomi, a mobile phone brand that is unheard of in the west but now outsells the US technology powerhouse in the Chinese market. Owners of an Apple iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy in Europe and America will soon find other brands such as Yulong and ZTE competing for their attention. Buoyed by success on the domestic stage, Chinese smartphone makers are ready to take on the technology establishment. More than a third of all smartphones are sold in China, and Xiaomi is one of five companies whose success in their domestic market has propelled them on to the international stage. China now accounts for one-fifth of the branded smartphones shipped globally, according to research firm Canalys, and the breakneck growth of its largest handset makers has begun to shake up the industry. Gartner says four of the 10 largest global makers are now Chinese. Their names \u2013 Lenovo, Yulong, Huawei and ZTE \u2013 are not well known outside China, and they are still considerably smaller than Samsung and Apple. Nonetheless, these four companies already outsell Nokia and BlackBerry. Chinese manufacturers, it seems, are no longer content with their traditional role of making phones for other firms. Instead, they are gearing up to take on the market leaders under their own name. Lenovo, which has already overtaken Hewlett-Packard as the largest seller of personal computers globally, announced this week that combined sales of its phones and tablets now outstrip sales of its traditional computers. Often mentioned as a potential buyer for its distressed Canadian rival BlackBerry, Lenovo's smartphone sales have grown 144% year on year. While the company's laptops can be found in most branches of John Lewis and Dixons, 95% of its smartphones are still in China, where it is number two behind South Korea's Samsung. However, as the PC market fades, Lenovo has made no secret of its desire to expand overseas. Its chief executive, Yang Yuanqing, espouses what he calls a \"two fist\" strategy \u2013 defending the home turf with one hand and attacking abroad with the other. Adept at facing two ways, Lenovo still relies on donkeys to deliver its products to some rural parts of China, but for a Beijing phone marketing event this month it secured an appearance on stage by the American basketball star Kobe Bryant. Lenovo's first forays into overseas smartphone sales have been in emerging markets, including Russia, India and Indonesia, and the company says it has secured a 5% share in markets that it has entered recently. \"We have very aggressive plans to explore overseas markets,\" Lenovo's mobile boss Liu Jun told China Daily this week. \"We hope the overseas market will contribute more than half of Lenovo's total smartphone revenue in the long run.\" Huawei, which ranks as the sixth largest smartphone seller worldwide, according to Canalys, has made no secret of its international expansion plans. It has located one team of handset designers in London and staged the global launch of its Ascend P6 in the capital, taking over the Roundhouse in Camden at an event attended by Carphone Warehouse founder Sir Charles Dunstone. Better known as a maker of telecoms equipment, where contracts with mobile network EE and BT have helped it become the second largest vendor after Sweden's Ericsson, phones comprise a small but growing part of its $35bn (\u00a322bn) a year in revenues. Yulong Computer Telecommunication Scientific Co, to give the company its full name, is the Chinese equivalent of BlackBerry. Founded in 1993 by chairman Guo Deying, its Coolpad smartphones have enhanced privacy settings that make them popular with government officials and businessmen. Sales of the devices have propelled it to the number four slot worldwide, but steps outside China have been tentative. Its first deal with a US network was secured last summer, with a budget 4G smartphone running on Google's Android software. Its sales topped out at 900,000. In seventh position globally is ZTE which, like its larger rival Huawei, also majors on telecoms equipment and internet devices such as household modems. F ounded in 1985, it is part-owned by the Chinese state. Its low-cost handsets are increasingly popular in the US, where it is now the fifth largest and fastest growing smartphone vendor, according to Strategy Analytics. In his regulation black T-shirt and jeans, Xiaomi's founder Lei Jun is the face of a new generation of Chinese technology entrepreneurs. His casual attire and crowd-pleasing performances at product launches have earned him the nickname, the Chinese Steve Jobs. But rather than focusing on foreign markets, Lei wants to turn Xiaomi into a software company. Its internet platform, which includes games, an online marketplace and a social messaging app, bring in just over $3m a month and Lei thinks that number could be much higher. \"Xiaomi selling mobile phones is like Amazon selling Kindles,\" he told Reuters. For Xiaomi, the smartphone is a device on which to sell more profitable wares. For other Chinese manufacturers, it is the key to a global empire.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "SSE and E.ON, two of the big six energy groups, have scrapped the practice of cold calling potential customers in the wake of a regulatory crackdown. But it comes as an expert has warned that the end of doorstep selling and multi-tariffs could be benefiting companies more than customers. There are concerns that the \"churn rate\" of energy users switching to rival providers to win more attractive deals has more than halved since companies were encouraged by the regulator, Ofgem, to halt what had been seen as predatory practices. The move by SSE came just months after it was handed a record\u00a310.5m fine by watchdog Ofgem for mis-selling, in an episode that its boss admitted made him \"ashamed\".In future only existing SSE customers or potential new ones who have agreed to a call will be contacted. Will Morris, SSE's retail managing director, said: \"Nobody likes receiving a sales call out of the blue and so we are stopping it\". EON also confirmed it would stop all unsolicited residential telephone sales calls with immediate effect. Anthony Ainsworth, Sales and Marketing Director of E.ON UK, said: \"Listening to our customers is critical to everything we do and as we've repeatedly shown, and are showing, we'll make the changes needed to constantly improve and offer the best service we can.\" E.ON will only contact residential customers and potential residential customers that have consented to be contacted. This includes not contacting former residential customers who have not given consent. The two companies' moves come after the government said last month it would take steps to make it easier for regulators to stop firms bombarding people with unsolicited calls, amid growing concern over the scale of the problem. Ministers plan to reduce the legal threshold of what is judged to be nuisance calls to allow watchdogs to investigate \"annoying\" and \"distressing\" communications as well. But Peter Atherton, a utility analyst at Liberum Capital , said power companies have privately admitted to him that the churn rate of lost customers had slumped from between 15%-20% in the last few years to around 7%. This had been attributed to the end of doorstep selling in particular which had been an effective way of attracting customers from rival firms: \"Obviously there was some mis-selling on the doorstep that needed to be stamped out but the result seems to have been that companies are finding it easier to hang on to their existing customers. So it is possible more rather than less people are on the wrong tariff.\" Atherton claims it typically cost companies \u00a350 in administrative charges every time they lost a customer and a further \u00a350 to win a new customer. This means that companies such as Centrica could be perhaps saving up to \u00a3120m a year from the slump in switching, the analyst believes. In April, SSE customers were urged to seek compensation from the company after Ofgem announced its record fine for \"prolonged and extensive\" mis-selling. Ofgem said it found \"failures at every stage of the sales process\" across telephone, in-store and doorstep selling activitiesat SSE. The company, which has 9.4 million customers in the UK, ended doorstep selling in 2011. Admitting after the fine it would take the company \"a couple of years\" to regain its customers' confidence, the chief executive Ian Marchant told the BBC he felt \"deeply ashamed that a company I've been involved in, where I've been proud to be a leader, was involved in something that it should not have been.\" Marchant took home a total of \u00a31.9m in salary and long term bonuses last year. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and industry regulator Ofcom are reviewing the effectiveness of the telephone preference service, which claims to allow consumers to opt out of unsolicited marketing calls, following criticisms that it fails to prevent cold calling. The ICO and Ofcom share responsibility for taking action against organisations that generate nuisance calls and text messages. The ICO handles nuisance calls from individuals while Ofcom covers silent and abandoned calls. Both already have powers to take action, but have to wait until a call centre making unwanted calls or texts attracts thousands of complaints, because the law requires them to prove that they are causing substantial harm or distress. Consumer group Which estimated that UK consumers received more than 700m unwanted calls in June. Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director said: \"Our research shows the energy industry is one of the main culprits for cold calling, so it's good to see a big supplier commit to ending unsolicited sales calls, and we hope other energy companies will now also stop this nuisance.\" Around 100 jobs will be affected by the closure of the SSE telesales unit. The company said it intends to redeploy 70 employees in Thatcham, Berkshire, and around 30 back office staff members in St Mellons, Cardiff, to other jobs in the company \"wherever possible\". Householders who receive unsolicited telesales calls should note the name of the company and phone back asking not to be contacted again. If the problem persists, contact the ICO on 0303 123 1113 or ico.org.uk. You can register with the telephone preference service by calling 0845 070 0707 or by visiting tpsonline.org.uk.",

      "bodyText": "A British software developer has set a record for the most money raised in a crowdfunding campaign, with its project to develop a new smartphone attracting pledges of more than $10m (\u00a36.3m). The fundraising by Canonical for its Ubuntu Edge phone has secured pledges worth $10,355,000 since opening on 22 July on the Indiegogo crowdfunding website \u2013 overtaking the previous record set by the Pebble smartwatch. The developer of Ubuntu software is hoping to deliver its first handsets in May next year, and backers paying $695 or more will be given their own devices as a reward. The company said that more than 14,500 smartphones had so far been pledged for. Backers include the media group Bloomberg, the first large company to join the campaign. It has pledged $80,000 for an enterprise package which includes 115 handsets. \"The campaign has sparked a level of interest that has surprised even us,\" Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth told the BBC, saying that it had prompted interest from some large handset makers. More than 22,000 pledges have flooded in from around the world, with the US, UK, Germany, Canada, Australia, France, Sweden and the Netherlands among the top contributing nations. However, the pledges may never be redeemed. This is because Canonical must meet its minimum fundraising goal of $32m to be allowed to claim the money, and the campaign deadline is in six days. \"We were mindful that tripling a record is always a big stretch and a big ask,\" Shuttleworth said, referring to the Pebble, which started production in January after fundraising on the US Kickstarter website. The Ubuntu campaign had already smashed the previous record set on Indiegogo: last year, Scanadu Scout used the website to raise $1.7m to develop a medical tricorder, which reads vital signs and sends them wirelessly to a smartphone. Shuttleworth founded Canonical in 2004. The South African multimillionaire made his fortune from selling his internet security software company to VeriSign for $575m in 1999, and now resides in the Isle of Man. Canonical, which employs 500 staff in 30 countries, espouses an open source ethic in making software for servers and cloud infrastructure. It was founded to create a PC operating system as an alternative to Microsoft Windows. But as the cutting edge of computing moves from the desktop to mobile devices, it has switched its attention to smartphones. Described by its maker as a \"superfone\", the Ubuntu Edge runs on both Ubuntu and Google's Android software, and can be connected to a desktop computer. The connection allows the phone to become the brain of a PC running on Ubuntu's operating system, with files stored on the handset visible on the computer screen. Bloomberg, which announced its involvement earlier this month, and has developers designing and building software for mobile devices, said Ubuntu Edge was \"an exciting prospect and one that complements our vision for open development on the mobile platform\".

      "bodyText": "We are ending a bit early today to go off and enjoy the summer weather. Thanks for all your comments and for following our coverage. Have a good weekend and see you all on Monday. US markets all open down slightly, after the largest decline on Wall Street in nearly two months yesterday. If they close down today it would be the first back-to-back weekly decline since late June. Dow Jones down 12.6 (0.08%) at 15100 S&amp;P 500 down 2.3 (0.14%) at 1659 Nasdaq down 2.1 (0.06%) at 3604 Contributor BigBlue80 points out the graph tweeted by @russian_market is from 2011 and points out emigration in Germany has actually fallen. Emigration in 2008 was 734k while it was only 679k in 2011. Over the last decade the amount of people leaving Germany has been relatively steady at 600-700k. Immigration has however increased: From 682k in 2008, 960k in 2011 and 2012 it was 1.1 million (net migration 400-500k). One US residence with no problem finding building materials is the White House, which is installing solar panels on the roof. An official told the Wall Street Journal the panels: will help demonstrate that historic buildings can incorporate solar energy and energy efficiency upgrades. US housing starts and permits for future homes rose less than expected in July, suggesting higher mortgage rates could be slowing the housing market's momentum. Housing starts increased 5.9% to 896,000 units in July and June's starts were revised up to 846,000 from 836,000. However, the rise was lower than the expected 900,000. Permits rose 2.7% in July to 943,000, slightly below the 945,000 expected. Mortgage rates have risen in anticipation at the Fed's tapering of its quantatative easing, expected to start next month. Builders have also complained that there is a shortage of labour and building materials. An interesting piece by Public Service Europe suggesting a Merkel win in the upcoming elections on September 22 will be good for business. The article says: The quarterly FT/Economist Global Business Barometer revealed that 60 per cent of 1,500 top business people polled believe the re-election of the centre-right leader would improve their confidence in Europe's economic prospects. Just 16 per cent would be less confident in the region's financial future following a Merkel victory. It quotes Merkel telling German television: I believe that in Europe at the moment we have to take care to coordinate our competitiveness more closely. We don't have to do everything in Brussels. We can also consider whether we can give something back. China and Japan have emerged as the leaders of an exodus from US Treasuries in June following the first signals from the US central bank that it could end its stimulus packages, new data shows. The two nations accounted for nearly all the record $40.8bn of net foreign selling. The sales were part of a $66.9bn of net sales by foreigners of long-term US securities in June \u2013 the fifth straight month of outflows. China, the largest foreign creditor reduced its holdings to $1.276tn and Japan reduced its holdings for the third month in a row to $1.08tn. Suggestions of a reduction to the US Fed's quantitative easing programme has pushed five-year yields to 1.53% today, from 0.65% in May. By comparison the yield on a five-year euro mid-swaps has gone to 1.19% from 0.61%. Some Asian bond issuers are now suggesting more euro-denominated bonds could be issued as a result. One banker told Reuters: \u201cThere is no talk of tapering in Europe, so interest rate volatility should be smaller than in the [US] Treasury market.\u201d Cross currency basis swaps from euros to dollars has also improved, meaning that funding in euros is becoming cheaper for the many Asian issuers that routinely swap back to dollars. Another sign of the unsteady recovery in Europe comes in the form of the car market, which recorded another mixed message. Registrations of new cars in Europe jumped 4.8% in July compared with the same month a year ago, to 1.02m vehicles. However, registrations in the first seven months of the year fell 5.2% to 7.46m. One reason for the slight year-on-year increase was an extra working day in Germany's motoring sector. While the trade surplus may have widened in June from last year, imports continue to fall. Imports to the 17 countries using the euro fell 6% on the year for a second consecutive month in June, while exports extended their fall to 3% - a second monthly drop in a row. Consumer prices fell by 0.5% on the month in July, with prices falling in all areas except services and energy costs. Today's excitement has got a bit much for Jennifer, who had to head off. Simon Neville will now be taking over the blog for the rest of the day and attempt to bring you the rest of the day's events. Eurozone inflation data is in, and was in line with expectations at 1.6% for July, making it the sixth straight month the rate has been below the ECB's 2% target. And below is a chart showing how the trade surplus has increased to \u20ac196.1bn compared with \u20ac66.1bn last year The euro area notched up a trade surplus of \u20ac16.9 bn (\u00a326.bn) in June 2013, the European Central Bank reported this morning. This reflected \u20ac11.8 bn surplus for goods, \u20ac8.7 bn services and \u20ac6.4 bn income. This was partly offset by a \u20ac10.1 bn deficit for current transfers . Figures are seasonally adjusted. Another sign of slowdown in the global economy? Maersk Line, the world's biggest container shipper, has cut its forecast in demand for containers to 2-3%, down from 2-4%. The Danish company accounts for 15% of the world's shipping container capacity. Maersk's profits still look healthy: it reported a $439m (\u00a3281m) profit for the second quarter of 2013, up from $227m a year earlier. Strange goings on on the Shanghai stock market today. The Shanghai Composite index closed 0.6% down, but not before an unexpected 6% surge in value earlier in the day. Shanghai-listed Everbright Securities suspended trading of its shares and said it was investigating a problem with its operating system. This morning, Everbright Securities strategic investment department's proprietary trading bureau had a problem when using its own arbitrage system. The company is investigating and dealing with the issue. Market watchers are blaming a lone trader with a \u201cfat finger\u201d. European markets have opened flat after yesterday's losses. UK FTSE: +0.09% at 6489 points France's Cac +0.19% at 4101 German Dax: -0.03% at 8374 Italy's FTSE MIB: - 0.01% at 17,461 Spain's Ibex: -0.01% at 8736 Investor worries over stimulus have also helped to bring down oil prices. Bloodshed in Egypt had sent the price of a barrel of Brent Crude to a four-month high of $111 on Thursday, but it has slipped back to $110. Egypt is not a major oil supplier, but investors are worried that the unrest could destablise oil transport throughout the Middle East. Egypt produces 728,000 barrels if oil a day, about 0.9% of global output, and accounts for 1.8% of the world's gas supply. BP has said their oil production in Egypt is unaffected, although Shell has closed its office for a few days. Meanwhile Tunisia, the north African country that was the cradle of the Arab Spring, has had its credit rating cut. As Fast FT reports, Standard and Poors have downgraded Tunisia's sovereign rating by two notches from BB to B. The rating agency said fears of terrorist attacks threatened Tunisia's vital tourist industry. We view the popular legitimacy of Tunisia's transitional institutions as increasingly contested, jeopardizing the approval of a new constitution, holding of elections, and implementation of growth-promoting economic reforms. Quote via Fast FT (metred paywall) Welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. European markets are expected to open lower this morning, as investors remain jittery that the US Federal Reserve will start to cut its massive stimulus programme from September. Asian markets are slightly down today, after the biggest one-day selloff in the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 since June. Investors remain fretful although members of the Fed say they are still making up their minds about cutting the $85bn bond-buying programme. A voting member of the monetary-policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, James Bullard, said yesterday that he would like to see more data before reaching a decision. As the Wall Street Journal (paywall) reports, he said: We don't have to be in a hurry to taper. But as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets observes, this is not stopping investors from selling stocks: It would appear that the weight of expectation surrounding an imminent tapering of asset purchases, along with a host of disappointing company earnings announcements, has prompted markets into thinking that a September taper is pretty much a done deal. What makes this conclusion all the more surprising is that apart from yesterday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, the economic data was by and large pretty disappointing, coming in below expectations across the board. We are also expecting European inflation data at 10am. I'll be following all the latest developments today \u2026",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone had been contracting for eighteen months since the second half of 2011. Though recent news is better, the European Central Bank projects Eurozone GDP will decline by 0.6% in 2013. The UK economy is not doing much better in terms of economic growth. Future growth is further threatened by the sharp fall in investment, especially pronounced in the UK and Southern Europe. Eurozone unemployment is horrendously high at over 19 million people, and a rate of 12%. In Spain and Greece unemployment is over 26% and youth unemployment over 50%. In the whole of the EU, 26 million people are unemployed. \"Austerians\" have argued that the policies followed were necessary to reduce the debt overhang.
