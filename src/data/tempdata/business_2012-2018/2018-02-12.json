      "bodyText": "George Christensen has put his name to a reported backbench revolt against the Turnbull government\u2019s proposed crackdown on payday lending, just a day after Scott Morrison denied he had been enlisted to water down the reform. The Nationals MP told Guardian Australia he turned to small credit lending in his 20s to pay for household goods and unexpected bills when he was \u201chocked up to the eyeballs in debt\u201d. On Friday five consumer groups wrote to parliamentarians noting the government circulated an exposure draft in October with a promise to introduce the bill by the end of 2017 but had failed to do so. On Monday the Courier-Mail reported that eight Liberal National party MPs had revolted over the payday lending bill and enlisted the treasurer to overturn cabinet\u2019s support for it. Under Labor scrutiny in question time, Morrison responded that the report was \u201centirely false\u201d. \u201cThis government is very concerned about the impacts of people on low incomes to ensure they do not get themselves into greater difficulty,\u201d he said. The reform, first unveiled in November 2016 by the minister for revenue and financial services, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, imposes a ceiling on the total payments that can be made under rent-to-buy schemes and restricts the amount rental companies and payday lenders can charge customers to 10% of their income. Christensen said the reforms were \u201cmostly OK\u201d but the 10% income credit limit \u201cwon\u2019t achieve anything for consumers but will ensure that small credit lenders across the nation go to the wall\u201d. \u201cWhere will people in desperate need then go to access finance?\u201d Christensen said that in his 20s when he was going through university on a \u201cmeagre income\u201d with a maxed-out credit card he had \u201cno other option than to go to a small credit lender\u201d. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the small credit lender I would have been stuffed \u2013 unable to pay a heap of unexpected bills and unable to buy a fridge and washing machine.\u201d Christensen said he had raised the issue with the previous minister, Michael McCormack, but not Michael Sukkar, who is now responsible. In their letter to parliamentarians, the Consumer Action Law Centre, the Financial Rights Legal Centre, Financial Counselling Australia, Choice and the Indigenous Consumer Assistance Network warned that \u201cunaffordable loans \u2026 result in people being unable to pay for basic needs or default on other necessary commitments\u201d. The letter noted that an independent review had found that all consumers would be able to access at least one $1,000 small amount credit contract during a 12-month period. The Consumer Action Law Centre director of policy, Denise Boyd, said: \u201cWe expect the government to pass the legislation as proposed and any further delay would be a terrible outcome for people experiencing financial stress who\u2019ve been lured into unaffordable loans and leases. \u201cThere is cross-party support for the reforms, which are sensible and keeps the credit for those who need it available while reducing the possible harm caused by repeat borrowing by reducing the possibility of a debt spiral.\u201d On Monday the Australian reported that the Coalition had been lobbied by the Institute of Public Affairs and the appliance rental industry body the Consumer Household Equipment Rental Providers Association over the bill. In Senate question time on Monday, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said: \u201cThe government of course recognises that small amount credit contract lenders and consumer lease providers play an important role providing credit to consumers who, in many cases, are not able to access mainstream finance. \u201cWe will ensure vulnerable consumers are afforded appropriate levels of consumer protection while continuing to allow access to small amount credit contracts and leases.\u201d Cormann said the reforms, which contain grandfathering provisions for existing contracts, \u201cwill be processed this year\u201d and apply 12 months after the passage of legislation.",

    "webTitle": "Confidential report into RBS small business scandal 'to be published'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A confidential report into Royal Bank of Scotland is set to be published by MPs after it was widely leaked, revealing details of the bank\u2019s treatment of nearly 6,000 struggling small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crash. The Commons Treasury select committee has been locked in a stand-off with the Financial Conduct Authority, which wrote the report, after giving the City watchdog until Friday to either publish it in full or share it with MPs. The FCA, which had published a redacted version, is not expected to yield to the committee\u2019s demand. But MPs are understood to be leaning towards publishing the document, a version of which has been seen by the Guardian, once they receive it. It details allegations of \u201cendemic\u201d behaviour by staff in RBS\u2019s Global Restructuring Group (GRG) division that managers should have been aware of. The division\u2019s treatment of clients led to financial distress for companies whose finances it was meant to be restructuring in a bid to help them survive, the report said. According to the report, one GRG manager was accused of threatening the boss of a company in financial difficulty with receivership. GRG staff were also alleged to have applied pressure on a businessman to increase the price he needed to pay to regain control of his company from \u00a3400,000 to \u00a32m, by using the \u201cKissinger school of negotiation\u201d. The phrase is thought to be a reference to the hardball tactics deployed by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger. When deciding what fees to charge small firms on their loans, GRG staff were told to \u201cpick a number, any number\u201d, according to the full version of the report. Portions of the report that have been leaked previously showed that staff in GRG were told to let businesses \u201chang themselves\u201d. An internal memo referred to struggling companies \u2013 many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis \u2013 as \u201cbasket cases\u201d, while staff were advised that \u201cmissed opportunities will mean missed bonuses\u201d. The FCA\u2019s investigation into GRG was prompted by allegations in 2013 from businessman Lawrence Tomlinson, who claimed that the division drove businesses into the ground for profit. The report did not find that RBS deliberately undermined companies for profit. But it says there was widespread inappropriate treatment of firms by GRG, including in one in six cases (16%) that it \u201cappears likely to have caused material financial distress\u201d. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has previously condemned the behaviour of staff within the division, including the memo advising staff to let firms \u201chang themselves\u201d, which was entitled: \u201cRope.\u201d \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the language used in this document was completely unacceptable and the bank does not condone it,\u201d he said. The bank has said that in most cases, firms did not suffer \u201cmaterial financial distress\u201d due to GRG\u2019s actions. An FCA spokesperson said: \u201cA leaked version of the report does not change the FCA\u2019s obligation to comply with the law in order to get the report published. The FCA wrote to the Treasury committee last week to set out the next steps we are taking.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Are Barclays\u2019 branches at risk over $3bn Qatar loan? | Larry Elliott", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In October 2008, almost a decade ago, the British banking system stood on the brink of collapse. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group were rescued by a government bailout, while a third bank \u2013 Barclays \u2013 avoided the need to take taxpayers\u2019 money through its own fundraising efforts in the UAE and Singapore. Part of that arrangement \u2013 a $3bn loan the UK bank made to Qatar \u2013 has now come back to haunt Barclays. Last summer, the Serious Fraud Office brought criminal charges against the bank\u2019s holding company and four former executives. Now the SFO has gone one step further and taken action against the bank\u2019s operating arm \u2013 Barclays Bank PLC. This new development matters because if the operating company were to be found guilty in a court case, the Financial Conduct Authority could strip Barclays of its banking licence. In theory, that could result in the bank\u2019s high street branches being closed. The chances of this happening, though, look infinitesimally small. For a start, the charges will be strongly contested both by the bank and the four individuals. The SFO has to prove there was something illegal about the Qatar loan. In the event of the charges being proved, a judge could fine the bank and jail the individuals for up to 10 years. It would then be up to the FCA to decide whether any further punishment was merited. In mitigation, Barclays would argue that the events of 2008 were all a long time time ago, and that it now has a completely new group of executives in control. The bank has also been trying \u2013 if not always succeeding \u2013 to patch up what were once quite fraught relations with the City\u2019s regulators. Even if the FCA is unimpressed by the passage of time argument, new ringfencing arrangements for the banks mean that the regulator could decide to remove the banking licence for the Barclay\u2019s investment banking arm and leave the retail division untouched. This would show the FCA\u2019s determination to stamp out bad behaviour but still represents the nuclear option, especially at a time when the financial sector is grappling with issues relating to Brexit. Would the watchdog really be prepared to push the button when it has alternatives \u2013 lifetime bans for individuals and huge corporate fines? Probably not. Larry Elliott Why did Warren Evans fold? How long have you got \u2026 Warren Evans stores were for first-time buyers who loved Habitat and Heals but couldn\u2019t really afford their prices. For a whole generation of young professionals in the capital in the 1980s and 1990s, its Camden bed store was a key destination for relatively cheap wooden double bed frame and futons. But now the firm, which expanded to 14 showrooms across the capital and the south, faces closure after failing to find a buyer. And its woes should give sleepless nights to anyone employed in the furniture sector. What did it for Warren Evans? Like any other retailer, sometimes it\u2019s just being out of step with fast-moving consumer tastes. There\u2019s nothing mid-century modern about a 1980s bedframe. Furniture retailing was also, for a while, resilient to online competition. But slick newcomers such as Made.com and Swoon Editions have switched us all on to web buying, even for bulky items. The mattress market has also rapidly moved online, judged by shares in Eve Sleep. It floated at 100p last May and although it sagged at first, falling to 80p last September, it has sprung to 125p this week. But this is not just a tale of online trouncing the high street. Furniture is a classic big-ticket consumer price item. When incomes are tight, as they are now, consumers can easily defer the purchase of a new sofa or bed for a year or two. Then there is the housing market. The biggest trigger for buying furniture is setting up home or moving house. But transaction activity has fallen flat, particularly in the London market, starving furniture retailers of customers. Warren Evans is the latest in a line of furniture retailers to struggle. Last year, DFS bought rivals Sofology and Dwell, as well as eight stores from Multiyork, which filed for administration in November. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 jobs are currently at risk. Another factor damaging the furniture retailers is rather less recognised. Those graduates of the 1980s and 1990s bought their own homes, usually within a decade of leaving college. Now that private renting is the most common form of tenure for 25- to 34-year-olds \u2013 and becoming the norm for older age groups too \u2013 there\u2019s a good reason they\u2019re not spending Saturdays mooching round furniture stores. They\u2019re not going to be buying their own furniture for a long time yet. Patrick Collinson",

      "body": "<p>In October 2008, almost a decade ago, the British banking system stood on the brink of collapse. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group were rescued by a government bailout, while a third bank \u2013 Barclays \u2013 avoided the need to take taxpayers\u2019 money through its own fundraising efforts in the UAE and Singapore.</p> <p>Part of that arrangement \u2013 a $3bn loan the UK bank made to Qatar \u2013 has now come back to haunt Barclays. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/sfo-charges-barclays-bank-executives-ceo-2008-qatar-fundraising\">Last summer, the Serious Fraud Office brought criminal charges against the bank\u2019s holding company and four former executives</a>. Now the SFO has gone one step further and taken action against the bank\u2019s operating arm \u2013 Barclays Bank PLC.</p> <p>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/12/barclays-bank-sfo-charges-qatar-loan\">new development matters </a>because if the operating company were to be found guilty in a court case, the Financial Conduct Authority could strip Barclays of its banking licence. In theory, that could result in the bank\u2019s high street branches being closed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/12/barclays-bank-sfo-charges-qatar-loan\">Barclays Bank charged again by SFO over Qatar loan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The chances of this happening, though, look infinitesimally small. For a start, the charges will be strongly contested both by the bank and the four individuals. The SFO has to prove there was something illegal about the Qatar loan.</p> <p>In the event of the charges being proved, a judge could fine the bank and jail the individuals for up to 10 years. It would then be up to the FCA to decide whether any further punishment was merited.</p> <p>In mitigation, Barclays would argue that the events of 2008 were all a long time time ago, and that it now has a completely new group of executives in control. The bank has also been trying \u2013 if not always succeeding \u2013 to patch up what were once quite fraught relations with the City\u2019s regulators.</p> <p>Even if the FCA is unimpressed by the passage of time argument, new ringfencing arrangements for the banks mean that the regulator could decide to remove the banking licence for the Barclay\u2019s investment banking arm and leave the retail division untouched. This would show the FCA\u2019s determination to stamp out bad behaviour but still represents the nuclear option, especially at a time when the financial sector is grappling with issues relating to Brexit.</p> <p>Would the watchdog really be prepared to push the button when it has alternatives \u2013 lifetime bans for individuals and huge corporate fines? Probably not.</p> <p><strong>Larry Elliott</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Why did Warren Evans fold? How long have you got \u2026</h2> <p>Warren Evans stores were for first-time buyers who loved Habitat and Heals but couldn\u2019t really afford their prices. For a whole generation of young professionals in the capital in the 1980s and 1990s, its Camden bed store was a key destination for relatively cheap wooden double bed frame and futons. But now the firm, which expanded to 14 showrooms across the capital and the south, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/12/warren-evans-jobs-at-risk-as-bedmaker-calls-in-administrators\">faces closure</a> after failing to find a buyer. And its woes should give sleepless nights to anyone employed in the furniture sector. <br></p> <p>What did it for Warren Evans? Like any other retailer, sometimes it\u2019s just being out of step with fast-moving consumer tastes. There\u2019s nothing mid-century modern about a 1980s bedframe. <br></p> <p>Furniture retailing was also, for a while, resilient to online competition. But slick newcomers such as Made.com and Swoon Editions have switched us all on to web buying, even for bulky items. The mattress market has also rapidly moved online, judged by shares in Eve Sleep. It floated at 100p last May and although it sagged at first, falling to 80p last September, it has sprung to 125p this week. </p> <p>But this is not just a tale of online trouncing the high street. Furniture is a classic big-ticket consumer price item. When incomes are tight, as they are now, consumers can easily defer the purchase of a new sofa or bed for a year or two. </p> <p>Then there is the housing market. The biggest trigger for buying furniture is setting up home or moving house. But transaction activity has fallen flat, particularly in the London market, starving furniture retailers of customers. </p> <p>Warren Evans is the latest in a line of furniture retailers to struggle. Last year, DFS bought rivals Sofology and Dwell, as well as eight stores from Multiyork, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/22/jobs-risk-furniture-maker-multiyork-administration\">which filed for administration in November</a>. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 jobs are currently at risk. </p> <p>Another factor damaging the furniture retailers is rather less recognised. Those graduates of the 1980s and 1990s bought their own homes, usually within a decade of leaving college. Now that private renting is the most common form of tenure for 25- to 34-year-olds \u2013 and becoming the norm for older age groups too \u2013 there\u2019s a good reason they\u2019re not spending Saturdays mooching round furniture stores. They\u2019re not going to be buying their own furniture for a long time yet.</p> <p><strong>Patrick Collinson</strong><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Unilever has threatened to withdraw its advertising from online platforms such as Facebook and Google if they fail to eradicate content which \u201ccreate division in society and promote anger and hate\u201d . Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of the sprawling multinational, whose brands include Dove, Magnum, Persil and Marmite, said that online platforms were sometimes \u201clittle better than a swamp\u201d. He told major advertising, media and tech firms gathered at a conference in California: \u201cAs one of the largest advertisers in the world, we cannot have an environment where our consumers don\u2019t trust what they see online.\u201d He added: \u201cWe cannot continue to prop up a digital supply chain \u2013 one that delivers over a quarter of our advertising to our consumers \u2013 which at times is little better than a swamp in terms of its transparency. \u201cIt is in the digital media industry\u2019s interest to listen and act on this. Before viewers stop viewing, advertisers stop advertising and publishers stop publishing.\u201d According to the analysts Pivotal, together Google and Facebook account for nearly three-quarters of all digital advertising in the US. In the UK the two have more than 60% of digital advertising and 90% of all new digital spending. Unilever\u2019s ultimatum comes as tech and social media firms are facing mounting criticism for failing to protect children and to erase fake news, hate speech and extremism. Last year Procter &amp; Gamble, the owner of brands including Pantene and Pampers, issued a similar warningbefore cutting $100m (\u00a372m) of digital ad spend without any negative impact on sales . Weed said: \u201cFake news, racism, sexism, terrorists spreading messages of hate, toxic content directed at children \u2013 parts of the internet we have ended up with is a million miles from where we thought it would take us.\u201d Unilever is the world\u2019s second biggest marketing spender, after P&amp;G, and spent \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.8bn) last year advertising its brands, which also include PG Tips, Vaseline and Bertolli. Google said in December it would hire thousands of new moderators after coming under fire for allowing child abuse videos and other offensive content to flourish on YouTube. Weed compared cleaning up the digital supply chain with efforts made by Unilever to find sustainable sources for its food ingredients and other raw materials and said the Anglo-Dutch business would no longer \u201cinvest in platforms or environments that do not protect our children or which create division in society, and promote anger or hate.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will prioritise investing only in responsible platforms that are committed to creating a positive impact in society.\u201d The company has trimmed its ad production as part of a cost-saving drive; it is making fewer TV ads and has halved the number of ad agencies it uses to 1,500. Ian Whittaker and Annick Maas, analysts at Liberum, said online advertising platforms such as Facebook and YouTube faced \u201cincreasing difficulties in persuading advertisers that their product offers a brand safe environment\u201d. \u201cMoreover, given the number of videos uploaded, there will always be an element of videos slipping through the net, which is likely to fuel further negative publicity. We therefore do not see this problem going away for the online platforms.\u201d They added: \u201cIt is clear advertisers are becoming increasingly wary of online\u2019s quality and so are unlikely to shift money aggressively from TV to online as these concerns mount.\u201d The Liberum analysts said advertisers\u2019 growing unease about tech companies\u2019 lack of content control could provide an opportunity for broadcasters to take a bigger slice of the online video advertising market. ITV has a 45% share of the UK TV ad market but only 6.5% of British online video advertising, where ad rates are much higher than in TV. Online could be a big driver of future profit growth for UK and European broadcasters, they said. How Unilever spends its advertising budget Ad agencies Unilever is halving the 3,000 ad agencies it uses globally and further cutting costs by making 30% fewer ads.

      "bodyText": "Retirement income is one of the most discussed economic topics in Australian life, and one of the biggest issues is that women generally have much less to retire on. A paper delivered to the Australian Gender Economics Workshop in Perth on Friday by the Grattan Institute\u2019s Brendan Coates asked about the best way to close the gender gap in retirement incomes. His answer highlights the distorted nature of the superannuation system and contains some broader policy implications regarding the impact of raising the superannuation guarantee from 9% to 12.5%. The problem of the gender pay gap in retirement is quite stark. Coates notes that \u201cmen\u2019s superannuation balances at retirement are on average twice as large as women\u2019s\u201d, and men also have much larger non-superannuation savings. This leaves women \u2013 particularly single women \u2013 \u201cat greater risk of poverty, housing stress and homelessness in retirement\u201d. But Coates notes that too often the analysis of the problem goes about it the wrong way \u2013 with a focus on superannuation. And yet, the reality is that while superannuation does draw much attention in the media and political debate, it is \u201cthe least important part of Australia\u2019s retirement income system, and will remain so in the foreseeable future.\u201d Coates argues that it will be \u201canother two decades before typical retirees have been contributing at least 9% of their wages to super for their entire working lives\u201d. But even younger workers who have long been paying the 9% superannuation guarantee \u201ctend to save more outside superannuation.\u201d Superannuation holdings mostly just reflect the gender pay gap. Consider a man and a woman born in 1964. They are now in the early 50s, but they have mostly likely had a very different working life: Around 80% of men born in 1964 were working full-time during the age of 30-45; by contrast only around 34% of women were employed full-time during those years. And while the situation has improved somewhat, even for those Gen Xers born in 1974, the differences in working lives are clear: As Coates notes, boosting the superannuation guarantee \u201cis unlikely to close the relative gender gap in retirement incomes because the guarantee is paid as a fixed percentage of wages, so will simply reflect the current gender gap in lifetime incomes\u201d. He also notes that boosting the superannuation guarantee impacts the pension as it suppresses the aggregate growth of wages, which in terms suppresses pension increases. As a result, Coates estimates that \u201clifting the super guarantee may help close the relative gender gap in retirement incomes since they currently save a smaller share of their income than men, but those extra savings will be largely offset by lower age pension payments\u201d. And what is more, the benefits of such a boost will largely go to the highest income earners: Coates argues that \u201chigher compulsory super contributions are ultimately funded by lower wages, which means lower living standards for workers today\u201d. Therefore, increasing the super guarantee to 12% \u201cwill hurt the living standards of low-income earners, the bulk of whom are women\u201d. Coates, however, is not arguing against the current superannuation guarantee \u2013 indeed he notes it is already doing its job. He calculates that for a median-income earner working for 40 years, and counting compulsory super contributions only, the current 9.5% guarantee and the age pension would \u201cprovide the average worker with a retirement income equal to 79% of their pre-retirement wage.\u201d Coates also argues against allowing more generous super tax concessions designed to improve the opportunity for women to \u201ccatch up\u201d\u2019 super contributions in their later working years. He notes that most of the contributions already are made by wealthy men \u2013 and any increase in the concessions would merely continue that situation: Instead, Coates suggests if the issue we are worried about is that women retire with comparatively less savings than men and are at much greater risk of absolute poverty in retirement due to their smaller retirement savings, then policies should be directed at those with lower incomes. To that end he notes that lifetime benefits of superannuation tax breaks go overwhelmingly to the wealthiest: Coates argues for limits on contributions from pre-tax income to $11,000 a year, as this would affect those unlikely to receive the pension. He also argues for a limit to life-time contributions from post-tax income to $250,000, or an annual cap on post-tax contributions of $50,000 a year and also that \u201cearnings in retirement \u2013 currently untaxed \u2013 should be taxed at 15%.\u201d He argues these three measures would reduce by around $4bn a year the amount of superannuation tax breaks that overwhelmingly go to high-income earning men. And finally, while increasing the pension would target lower-income earners, Coates argues a better way to assist women and low-income earners would be to boost rent assistance. He calculates that a targeted $500 a year boost to rent assistance for age pensioners would cost $250m a year, and would be \u201cthe most efficient way to alleviate the financial hardship among low-paid retirees\u201d. The paper on the gender gap is welcome not only for highlighting the distortions within the superannuation system \u2013 distortions which would be accentuated by raising the guarantee to 12.5% \u2013 but it also highlights that the big issue with the gender income retirement gap is the gender pay gap.",

      "bodyText": "The maker of the painkiller OxyContin is to stop promoting the drug to doctors and halve its salesforce, as it faces a growing number of lawsuits over its role in the US opioid crisis. Purdue Pharma said its remaining 200 sales representatives would no longer visit doctors\u2019 offices to promote its opioid drugs. OxyContin is Purdue\u2019s biggest-selling drug and is estimated to have generated $1.8bn of sales last year, down from $2.8bn five years earlier. The Connecticut-based company is owned by the Sackler family, whose wealth exceeds $13bn. Purdue said: \u201cWe have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers.\u201d Opioid overdoses have become the leading cause of death among the under-50s in the US. Opioids, including methadone and fentanyl, heroin and other opiates, were responsible for about 53,000 US deaths in 2016; an average of 146 a day, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the root of the deadly drug epidemic are the overprescribing of opioid painkillers for conditions ranging from severe back pain and arthritis to sports injuries. The crisis, which Donald Trump declared a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d last year \u2013 dates back to the 1990s when healthcare organisations encouraged doctors to treat postoperative pain more aggressively. Soon afterwards drug companies, led by Purdue, started marketing opioids for all kinds of chronic pain, enticing doctors with incentives and all-expenses-paid trips. Another drugmaker, Endo International, pulled its Opana ER painkiller off the market in July after the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, requested the withdrawal. Purdue and other drugmakers have been fighting a barrage of litigation by states, counties and cities that have accused them of aggressively pushing addictive painkillers. The lawsuits have accused Purdue of playing down OxyContin\u2019s addiction risk and of misleading marketing that overstated the benefits of opioids for treating chronic, rather than short-term, pain. At least 14 states are suing the company. Steve Marshall, the attorney general for Alabama, filed a lawsuit on behalf of the state last week. Purdue is also facing a federal investigation by the US attorney\u2019s office in Connecticut. Purdue has denied the allegations. It has said its drugs were approved by the FDA and account for only 2% of all opioid prescriptions. In 2007, the company and three executives pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the misbranding of OxyContin and agreed to pay $634.5m to resolve a US Justice Department investigation.",

      "bodyText": "After a week which saw some $4tn wiped off the value of global stock markets, there is a better mood among investors at the moment. European markets have moved higher, with the FTSE 100 up 1.3% , Germany\u2019s Dax 1.7% higher and France\u2019s Cac climbing 1.5%. In early trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 292 points or 1.2%, even as US bond prices continue to fall. But analysts expect continued volatilty as the week progresses, with US inflation figures on Wednesday likely to be a key indicator for the market\u2019s progress. Meanwhile the City watchdog has warned that firms need to do more to deal with the risks of computerised trading. Elsewhere Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said further rises in interest rates would be appropriate if the recovery in the global economy and an improving labour market continued to offset any Brexit weakness. Greece is considering more bond issues after successfully raising \u20ac3bn last week. And another 4,418 jobs were saved at the collapsed contractor Carillion. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The recovery in US markets seen late on Friday is continuing as Wall Street opens, despite the continuing strength of US bond yields. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 300 points or 1.25%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are both up around 1%. Here\u2019s IG\u2019s opening calls for the US markets: Shares may be moving higher in the wake of Friday\u2019s rebound on Wall Street, but US bond yields are also on the rise. Normally bond yields fall when markets rise, but 10 year US treasury yields remain at four year highs. Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, said: Have stocks and bond yields decoupled again? Friday\u2019s reversal and today\u2019s bullish follow-through in the stock markets have not been supported by rising government bond prices. As bonds have continued to sell-off, yields have pushed further higher. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has now climbed to above 2.9% for the first time since early 2014. Should yields march further higher \u2013 which is quite possible with the upcoming US inflation and retail sales data to look forward to on Wednesday \u2013 then there is a possibility the equity markets could be in for another volatile week. Indeed, we think that far too much technical damage has been incurred in the indices for the bulls to make a quick comeback and with all guns blazing...So, Friday\u2019s bounce may well prove to be a mere dead-cat bounce for stocks. Meanwhile, Greece is watching the markets carefully with an eye to launching more bond sales before its final bailout program ends in August. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After successfully raising \u20ac3bn from its sale of a seven-year bond last week, Athens is now looking to complete at least two more bond sales as part of wider steps to reinforce market access and show investors it can go it alone. The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has hinted that future issues could include a three-year bond \u2013 launched around the time of the March 4 general elections in Italy \u2013 and a ten-year bond. The government has announced plans to build a \u20ac19bn cash buffer that would allow the debt stricken country to cover debt repayments once the bailout programme expires. Market turbulence in the form of more corrections, however, could yet dash plans to create the safety net. Volatility in the wake of last week\u2019s sell-off caused the government to delay trade of the seven -year bond by 48 hours proving that while Greece has progressed both fiscally and in terms of structural reforms it is still at risk of exogenous forces. The seven-year bond was sold at a yield of 3.5% with UK investors leading the pack of more than 200 hedge funds, banks and fund managers who lodged bids. The stock market falls we have been seeing are not unusual but did take longer than expected to happen, says Richard Stammers, investment strategist at European Wealth Group. And things are likely to remain volatile, he says: We expect the short term to remain bumpy - possibly very bumpy. The definition of a correction is 10% off from the recent high and of a bear market, 20% off from the year high. So, whilst we are not in bear market territory, we need to recognise for every short term bounce there could be an equal and opposite slide back. Could we see lows of 15%? Quite possibly so, if we do, what should we do? We stand by our view that the next bear market will be triggered by an expectation of the end of the business cycle. We may now be late cycle, and the end may now be sooner than many had expected, but we don\u2019t think it is imminent. So, with the global economy broadly strong, and many companies delivering robust earnings, we think this is a buying opportunity. These periods of correction and uncertainty are not pleasant but they should not be seen as unusual. What was unusual was that it took so long to happen. Here is Reuters on the interest rate comments from Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe: Vlieghe said on Monday that a further rise in British interest rates was likely to be appropriate if a strong global economy and a labour market pick-up continued to offset Brexit headwinds. \u201cA further rise in interest rates is likely to be appropriate if all those trends continue and we are on a trajectory. It wasn\u2019t just one hike in November and then we take a very long break,\u201d he said at a panel discussion hosted by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank. The central banker also said the level of interest rates that the BoE needs to reach before it starts to reverse its quantitative easing programme could come under review. Previously the BoE has said rates would need to reach around 2 percent before it started to sell its 435 billion pounds ($603 billion) of government bonds, in order to give headroom for future rate cuts during a downturn. Vlieghe said that since then the BoE had found it could cut rates below 0.5 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s ongoing experience selling debt holdings would also influence the BoE\u2019s decision on when to start to sell assets, he said. Another 4,418 jobs at collapsed Carillion have been saved, says the Official Receiver. The staff involved are at prison facilities management, defence bases catering, and cleaning services. So far around a third of Carillion\u2019s staff have had their employment confirmed. In this latest announcement, the receiver said employment for 59 staff working on paused construction projects could not be secured and they would leave the business. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB, said: MPC voting member Gertjan Vlieghe has been speaking this morning on a panel discussing household debt in London and remarks such as \u201cthere is increased evidence that tighter labour markets are beginning to have upwards effect on wages\u201d and that \u201cif there is less credit headwind to the UK economy then we maybe ready for rate hikes\u201d are certainly erring on the side of being hawkish. The comments are even more noteworthy given that Mr Vlieghe is deemed one of the most dovish voting members. More from my colleague Richard Partington who is listening to the Bank of England\u2019s Gertjan Vlieghe speak at the Resolution Foundation\u2019s debt conference: (for disruption, read situation - the perils of autocorrect!) City firms need to do more to mitigate the risks of algorithmic trading, according to the UK\u2019s financial watchdog. Automated trading was suggested as on of the causes of the recent stock market turmoil, with computerised selling accelarating as share prices tumbled. In a new report the Financial Conduct Authority says: Automated technology brings significant benefits to investors, including increased execution speed and reduced costs. However, it can also amplify certain risks. It is essential that key oversight functions, including compliance and risk management, keep pace with technological advancements. In the absence of appropriate systems and controls, the increased speed and complexity of financial markets can turn otherwise manageable errors into extreme events with potentially wide-spread implications. As a result, algorithmic trading continues to be an area of focus for the FCA and other regulators across the globe. In general, we are encouraged that firms have taken steps to reduce risks inherent to algorithmic trading. However, further improvement is needed in a number of areas. For example, some firms lacked a suitable process to identify algorithmic trading across their business and did not have appropriate documentation in place to demonstrate suitable development and testing procedures are maintained. In these cases, firms also lacked a robust and comprehensive governance framework. Additionally, firms need to do more work to identify and reduce potential conduct risks created by their algorithmic trading strategies. This includes delivering suitable market abuse training for staff involved in the development and implementation processes. Firms also need to consider the potential impact their algorithmic trading activity (including the combined impact of multiple algorithmic strategies) may have on the fair and effective operation of financial markets. We will continue to assess whether firms have taken sufficient steps to reduce risks arising from algorithmic trading. Vlieghe says there is increased evidence that tight labour markets are beginning to have an upward effect on wages [another reason for a possible rise in rates]. He adds: The Resolution Foundation is holding a seminar on household debt at the moment, with speakers including the Bank of England\u2019s Gertjan Vlieghe: The removal of some of the market\u2019s recent complacency is no bad thing, says Joseph Amato at investment management group Neuberger Berman: Before last week, the last meaningful market correction took place in 2016, when investors were concerned about the potential for a US recession, a China hard landing and low oil prices. But weakness was short-lived and markets have generally advanced since then. The most recent pullback seems to have been triggered by the 2.9% wage inflation reading in the US and resulting fears the Fed would accelerate interest rate increases. But the loss was exacerbated by excessive investor complacency \u2013 something that has clearly been removed over the past week \u2013 as well as technical factors. This removal of complacency is a healthy development, as is the reduction in equity valuations... We do not expect an immediate resolution of market technical quirks or an end to concerns about the pace of central bank rate hikes. It is possible market volatility could have a negative impact on the real economy \u2013 undermining the so-called wealth effect and consumer confidence, and substantially widening credit spreads. However, there is little current indication anything like that is taking place. In fact, global economies continue to show exceptional strength \u2013 something that should be a key driver of markets in the coming months. Robert Lea, head of global equity research at Ashburton Investments also expects markets to climb this year, albeit at a slower rate: On balance, we still expect global equity markets to rise this year. However, we expect the rate of increase to moderate. The risk of an outright bear market remains low, as bear markets normally coincide with recessions. We see a low risk of recession currently and expect growth in the global economy to continue gathering momentum. However, we continue to think the market has under-estimated the scope for a rise in inflation this year \u2013 both in the US and globally. We also think the market has potentially misjudged the Fed\u2019s desire to normalise interest rate policy. That said, rates should likely remain low, in absolute and historical terms. The Vix volatility index, which had been pretty dormant for several months before surging last week, has slipped back this morning. It hit as high as 50 last week but is now down 10% at 26 as some calm returns. One of the sparks for the recent sell-off was the stronger than expected growth in US wages, which led to speculation that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more often than previously expected. So one of the key events this week is likely to be the latest US inflation data, which could go some way to either easing or confirming those concerns. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor: Investors are breathing a sigh of relief after the torrid times last week, with European equity markets rallying this morning. Buying the dip has been a very difficult call in recent days, with every attempt at engagement punished in subsequent market moves, so investors will be hoping that this is a genuine buying opportunity. The key event of the week is US Consumer Price data on Wednesday, with investors anxious to determine whether the inflation fears that have helped to drive recent market moves have been overdone or if these concerns are justified. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi\u2019s Derek Halpenny said: A softer print on Wednesday would go some way to easing current investor fears. Wage inflation did not emerge in 2017 and even if you believe the data last week is a sign of things to come, usual lags mean this will not be evident in consumer prices until toward year-end or even into 2019. We suspect that investors\u2019 fears over inflation should subside over the coming weeks, which will help to stabilise equity markets, long-term yields and bring levels of volatility back down. But after the scale of this equity price correction, investors are likely to remain defensive this week. Even a slight upward surprise in the inflation data could be enough to warrant a further sell-off. One of the world\u2019s biggest advertisers is warning it might take action against tech companies over online harassment, hate speech and other issues: The consumer goods multinational Unilever is threatening to withdraw its advertising from online platforms such as Facebook and Google if they fail to protect children, promote hate or create division in society. In a speech later today, Keith Weed, the Unilever chief marketing officer, will say that, as a brand-led business, Unilever \u201cneeds its consumers to have trust in our brands\u201d. Unilever is the world\u2019s second largest marketing spender, after Procter &amp; Gamble, and spent \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.8bn) last year advertising its brands, which include PG Tips, Marmite, Dove and Persil. The company has trimmed its ad production as part of a cost-saving drive; it is making fewer TV ads and has halved the number of ad agencies it uses to 1,500. Our full report is here: European markets are holding on to their early gains, and with US futures suggesting a positive open on Wall Street, there is some cautious optimism around. But Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, warned: As proven time and again, these things can turn on a dime, and it is way, way too early to treat the day\u2019s initial growth with anything but caution. Still, the FTSE climbed more than 1% after the bell, taking it towards 7170, with the CAC up 1.2% and the DAX leading the charge thanks to a near 1.7% surge, one that leaves the German index back above 12300. Importantly the Dow Jones currently looks set to follow in Europe\u2019s footsteps, with the index\u2019s futures pointing to a 170 point rise later this afternoon. The forex markets were slightly more subdued. Both the pound and euro tried to claw back some of their recent losses against the dollar; the former rose 0.2%, but is still the wrong side of $1.385, while the latter jumped 0.3% to tease $1.227. Against each other, meanwhile, there was nothing to separate the two, with sterling flat around \u20ac1.128. There isn\u2019t really that much for investors to work with this Monday, with the focus likely on Tuesday and Wednesday\u2019s potentially week-defining UK and US inflation readings. As forecast, European markets are benefitting from the rebound on Wall Street and have started the week on a brighter note after the recent turmoil. The FTSE 100 is up 0.8% while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 1% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.9%. With the prospect of rising UK interest rates, Brexit concerns, and the continuing squeeze on real wages, UK consumers appeared to have kept their money in their pockets last month, according to a Visa survey. Reuters has the details: British shoppers spent less last month than the year before, causing spending in January to fall for the first time since 2013, according to a survey which underscored many households\u2019 caution about their finances and the approach of Brexit. Visa, whose debit and credit cards are used for a third of payments in Britain, said on Monday that consumers stayed away from the traditional post-Christmas sales last month. Household spending fell by 1.2 percent in January compared with the same month in 2017, with spending in shops down by 4 percent, it said. \u201cConsumer spending entered the new year on a downbeat note, falling for the eighth time in the past nine months, as Britons continued to cut back on spending,\u201d Visa\u2019s chief commercial officer, Mark Antipof, said. A fall in car sales weighed on the overall sales figures too. But there was better news for hotels and restaurants - as well as for hair salons and sellers of beauty products, as consumers looked for small treats for themselves. Britain\u2019s economy lagged behind stronger growth in other rich nations in 2017 as higher inflation since the Brexit vote and slow wage growth pinched consumers\u2019 spending power. Annabel Fiddes, an economist at financial data firm IHS Markit which produces the survey for Visa, said concerns about Brexit were weighing on consumer confidence. But spending could pick up later this year as inflation is expected to fall back while wages rise more quickly, she added. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u2019s market turmoil, which saw Wall Street enter correction territory (losing 10% from its recent peak) and some $4trn wiped off global share values, investors will be hoping for some respite this morning. And after US markets staged a later rally on Friday and some positive moves in Asia, Europe is expected to open higher: But that does not necessarily mean everything is now hunky dory. For a start the recent rise in bond yields - one of the factors behind the sudden turn in sentiment - may not be over yet. Central banks will continue to withdraw the stimulus measures which have supported the market since the financial crisis, which in turn will put pressure on bonds. And the volatility we have seen over the past couple of weeks is also unlikely to fade quickly. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: For a market that has enjoyed steady gains and fairly low volatility over the course of the past two years the steepness of the falls speaks to a complacency that has been prevalent for a while now and which appears to have been shattered in the wake of a surge in volatility. How this plays out over the coming days depends on whether the rebound we saw on Friday can translate into some form of base for a continuation of the uptrend that has been in place for the last nine years. This may well depend on whether we see further increases in bond yields, or a rise in interest rate expectations from other central banks around the world. ..There are other concerns, US margin debt still remains near record levels and the prospect of further losses, combined with the prospect of higher rates could prompt further jitters, not to mention the untried reaction function of a whole new breed of equity investors and traders who have never experienced the type of volatility that we\u2019ve gone through over the last few days. It is true that economic fundamentals remain fairly solid but it is also important to remember that this is already probably priced into US equities already, given that we\u2019ve now seen tax reform get passed, along with a new US budget, which in itself is likely to see bond prices come under further pressure. We\u2019ve already seen a raft of US companies announce significant increases in salaries and bonuses and this was followed last week, with the news that German metal workers won a 4.3% wage rise, a trend that looks set to be replicated across the world, as governments urge employers to increase minimum salaries to more acceptable levels. And the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund is predicting that \u201ca bigger shakeout\u201d is coming. Echoing the complacency theme, Bob Prince, co-chief investment officer at the $160bn US hedge fund Bridgewater, told the Financial Times (\u00a3): There had been a lot of complacency built up in markets over a long time, so we don\u2019t think this shakeout will be over in a matter of days. We\u2019ll probably have a much bigger shakeout coming. Here\u2019s our report on his comments, with an update on Asian markets: Otherwise it\u2019s fairly quiet on the economic and corporate front, although Bank of England MPC member Jan Vlieghe is speaking later this morning.",

The government has announced plans to build a \u20ac19bn cash buffer that would allow the debt stricken country to cover debt repayments once the bailout programme expires. </p> <p>Market turbulence in the form of more corrections, however, could yet dash plans to create the safety net. Volatility in the wake of last week\u2019s sell-off caused the government to delay trade of the seven -year bond by 48 hours proving that while Greece has progressed both fiscally and in terms of structural reforms it is still at risk of exogenous forces. The seven-year bond was sold at a yield of 3.5% with UK investors leading the pack of more than 200 hedge funds, banks and fund managers who lodged bids.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd514401d1d9ec9a81489c6640f92c10e56ae626\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd514401d1d9ec9a81489c6640f92c10e56ae626/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsakalotos in his office in the finance ministry in Athens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsakalotos in his office in the finance ministry in Athens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Costas Baltas/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a817d79e4b027761ed47cd8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-12T11:44:16.963Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The stock market falls we have been seeing are not unusual but did take longer than expected to happen, says Richard Stammers, investment strategist at European Wealth Group.

The definition of a correction is 10% off from the recent high and of a bear market, 20% off from the year high. So, whilst we are not in bear market territory, we need to recognise for every short term bounce there could be an equal and opposite slide back. Could we see lows of 15%? Quite possibly so, if we do, what should we do?</p> <p>We stand by our view that the next bear market will be triggered by an expectation of the end of the business cycle. We may now be late cycle, and the end may now be sooner than many had expected, but we don\u2019t think it is imminent. So, with the global economy broadly strong, and many companies delivering robust earnings, we think this is a buying opportunity.</p> <p>These periods of correction and uncertainty are not pleasant but they should not be seen as unusual.

It is possible market volatility could have a negative impact on the real economy \u2013 undermining the so-called wealth effect and consumer confidence, and substantially widening credit spreads. However, there is little current indication anything like that is taking place. In fact, global economies continue to show exceptional strength \u2013 something that should be a key driver of markets in the coming months.</p> </blockquote> <p>Robert Lea, head of global equity research at Ashburton Investments also expects markets to climb this year, albeit at a slower rate:<em> </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On balance, we still expect global equity markets to rise this year. However, we expect the rate of increase to moderate. The risk of an outright bear market remains low, as bear markets normally coincide with recessions. We see a low risk of recession currently and expect growth in the global economy to continue gathering momentum.</p> <p>However, we continue to think the market has under-estimated the scope for a rise in inflation this year \u2013 both in the US and globally. We also think the market has potentially misjudged the Fed\u2019s desire to normalise interest rate policy. That said, rates should likely remain low, in absolute and historical terms.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a815af2e4b027761ed47bab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-12T09:16:21.591Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Vix volatility index, which had been pretty dormant for several months before surging last week, has slipped back this morning.</p> <p>It hit as high as 50 last week but is now down 10% at 26 as some calm returns.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-12T09:16:44.935Z\">at 9.16am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a815419e4b027761ed47b93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-12T08:50:20.789Z\">8.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the sparks for the recent sell-off was the stronger than expected growth in US wages, which led to speculation that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more often than previously expected.</p> <p>So one of the key events this week is likely to be the latest US inflation data, which could go some way to either easing or confirming those concerns.

For a start the recent rise in bond yields - one of the factors behind the sudden turn in sentiment - may not be over yet. Central banks will continue to withdraw the stimulus measures which have supported the market since the financial crisis, which in turn will put pressure on bonds. And the volatility we have seen over the past couple of weeks is also unlikely to fade quickly. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a market that has enjoyed steady gains and fairly low volatility over the course of the past two years the steepness of the falls speaks to a complacency that has been prevalent for a while now and which appears to have been shattered in the wake of a surge in volatility.</p> <p>How this plays out over the coming days depends on whether the rebound we saw on Friday can translate into some form of base for a continuation of the uptrend that has been in place for the last nine years. This may well depend on whether we see further increases in bond yields, or a rise in interest rate expectations from other central banks around the world.<strong> </strong></p> <p>..There are other concerns, US margin debt still remains near record levels and the prospect of further losses, combined with the prospect of higher rates could prompt further jitters, not to mention the untried reaction function of a whole new breed of equity investors and traders who have never experienced the type of volatility that we\u2019ve gone through over the last few days. </p> <p>It is true that economic fundamentals remain fairly solid but it is also important to remember that this is already probably priced into US equities already, given that we\u2019ve now seen tax reform get passed, along with a new US budget, which in itself is likely to see bond prices come under further pressure. </p> <p>We\u2019ve already seen a raft of US companies announce significant increases in salaries and bonuses and this was followed last week, with the news that German metal workers won a 4.3% wage rise, a trend that looks set to be replicated across the world, as governments urge employers to increase minimum salaries to more acceptable levels.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund is predicting that \u201ca bigger shakeout\u201d is coming. Echoing the complacency theme, Bob Prince, co-chief investment officer at the $160bn US hedge fund Bridgewater,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58ba6e12-0e74-11e8-8cb6-b9ccc4c4dbbb\"> told the Financial Times (\u00a3)</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There had been a lot of complacency built up in markets over a long time, so we don\u2019t think this shakeout will be over in a matter of days. We\u2019ll probably have a much bigger shakeout coming.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s our report on his comments, with an update on Asian markets:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/12/stock-markets-braced-for-more-losses-amid-volatility-and-inflation-fears\">'Big shakeout coming': markets stem losses as hedge fund sounds warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Otherwise it\u2019s fairly quiet on the economic and corporate front, although Bank of England MPC member Jan Vlieghe is speaking later this morning.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Staff at the ethical bedmaker Warren Evans will be hoping to learn more about their fate this week as administrators continue to seek a buyer for the London-based firm. The company, which employs 287 staff and has 14 showrooms across the capital and the south-east, appointed administrators Duff &amp; Phelps late last week, despite claiming strong pre-Christmas sales. The bedmaker, which has a manufacturing site in east London and uses timber from sustainable forests, had been seeking new investment since November last year. If administrators fail to find a last-minute buyer, the business looks set to close. \u201cWarren Evans is rightly recognised as one of the UK\u2019s leading bed, mattress and furniture retailers, but trading conditions are exceptionally challenging, with the business hit by rising manufacturing costs and the continued squeeze on consumer wallets and confidence,\u201d said joint administrator Allan Graham. \u201cOver the past year the business has been growing its market share with major investments in new product development. However, the search for a new investment partner has proved to be ultimately unsuccessful, and so the business and management were left with no option but to go into administration.\u201d Founded in 1978, the company was started by Warren Evans with a couple of hundred pounds borrowed from his sister. He opened his first showroom in 1985 and expanded steadily, carving out a reputation as a green furniture maker. It was repeatedly named as the Observer ethical retailer of the year, and a Sunday Times best green company. The company also pioneered the offer to replace a mattress up to 120 days after delivery if the customer was not happy. Customers with post-purchase problems were being told by staff over the weekend to email the company but to expect a delayed response. Warren Evans is the latest in a line of furniture retailers to struggle. Last year, DFS bought rivals Sofology and Dwell, as well as eight stores from Multiyork, which filed for administration in November. Since the start of 2018, as many as 10,000 jobs have been put under threat in the UK retail industry.",

      "body": "<p>Staff at the <a href=\"https://www.warrenevans.com/\">ethical bedmaker Warren Evans</a> will be hoping to learn more about their fate this week as administrators continue to seek a buyer for the London-based firm. </p> <p>The company, which employs 287 staff and has 14 showrooms across the capital and the south-east, appointed administrators Duff &amp; Phelps late last week, despite claiming strong pre-Christmas sales. </p> <p>The bedmaker, which has a manufacturing site in east London and uses <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-forest-products-business\">timber from sustainable forests</a>, had been seeking new investment since November last year. </p> <p>If administrators fail to find a last-minute buyer, the business looks set to close. </p> <p>\u201cWarren Evans is rightly recognised as one of the UK\u2019s leading bed, mattress and furniture retailers, but trading conditions are exceptionally challenging, with the business hit by rising manufacturing costs and the continued squeeze on consumer wallets and confidence,\u201d said joint administrator Allan Graham. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOver the past year the business has been growing its market share with major investments in new product development. However, the search for a new investment partner has proved to be ultimately unsuccessful, and so the business and management were left with no option but to go into administration.\u201d </p> <p>Founded in 1978, the company was started by Warren Evans with a couple of hundred pounds borrowed from his sister. He opened his first showroom in 1985 and expanded steadily, carving out a reputation as a green furniture maker. It was repeatedly named as the Observer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2012/may/31/photos-from-the-2012-observer-ethical-awards\">ethical retailer of the year</a>, and a Sunday Times best green company. </p> <p>The company also pioneered the offer to replace a mattress up to 120 days after delivery if the customer was not happy. Customers with post-purchase problems were being told by staff over the weekend to email the company but to expect a delayed response. </p> <p>Warren Evans is the latest in a line of furniture retailers to struggle. Last year, DFS bought rivals Sofology and Dwell, as well as eight stores from Multiyork, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/22/jobs-risk-furniture-maker-multiyork-administration\">which filed for administration in November</a>. Since the start of 2018, as many as 10,000 jobs have been put under threat in the UK retail industry.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s warning that it plans to raise interest rates from as early as May will hit millions of low-income families who have only survived financially for a decade by using cheap credit. The Resolution Foundation said almost half of low-income families were in debt distress before Threadneedle Street said last week that it needed to increase the base rate at an accelerated pace over the next two years. The Bank governor, Mark Carney, said the strength of the economy warranted higher borrowing costs. He cited rising average wages and resilient GDP growth as reasons to begin pushing interest rates from the historically low level of 0.5%. But a study by the foundation showed the proportion of households in some form of debt distress rose to 45% among the poorest fifth of working age households, with more than a third experiencing difficulty in paying for accommodation and one in six in arrears on either their mortgage or consumer debts. Households headed by someone aged 25-34 spent nearly \u00a31 in every \u00a35 of their pre-tax income on debt repayments in 2017, compared with 20p for households aged 65 and over. Levels of consumer credit have soared in recent years to more than \u00a3200bn, prompting debt charities to warn that lenders are repeating the mistakes made in the early part of the century, when households on low incomes were sold loans they could not repay. Matt Whittaker, the chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said most of the increase in consumer debt since 2014 was among middle and higher income groups and they could afford to absorb an increase in interest rates. The cost of servicing Britain\u2019s household debt is low by historical standards, he said, with repayments accounting for 7.7% of disposable income, well below the 12.3% recorded just before the financial crisis, and in line with the level seen during the mid-1990s and early 2000s. \u201cHowever, while the recent growth in debt is less of a concern, it is very worrying that almost half of low-income families are already showing signs of debt distress,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cWhile rates have been at historic lows for a decade now, many families have experienced a tight income squeeze over this period and have not been able to get back on the front foot when it comes to servicing their debts.\u201d Forecasts from the Bank of England last week showed that inflation and rising wages were likely to cancel each other out this year, leaving poor households without the benefit of rising real incomes to cope with higher interest bills. Whittaker said: \u201cPolicymakers must have regard for those low-income households who are already struggling to pay off their debts, and who could be really exposed if interest rates go up faster than currently expected.\u201d The foundation said an increase of two percentage points in mortgage rates would cause a modest increase in the \u201cat risk\u201d population of households spending 30% or more of their pre-tax income on mortgage debt servicing. Currently, 12% of mortgagor households sit above this threshold but the foundation said this figure would rise to 15% or 1.1m households. Among mortgage payers in the poorest fifth of households, 57% are already believed to be in the \u201cat risk\u201d group, rising to 59% following a two-percentage-point rise in the Bank of England base rate.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Financial markets are braced for more volatility this week amid predictions from the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund that a \u201cbig shakeout\u201d is coming. The Australian stock market was the first to test the water on Monday morning and one point was down 0.7%. But it rallied slightly in afternoon trade to close down 0.3%. Bourses elsewhere in Asia Pacific also found calmer waters. South Korea\u2019s Kospi was up 0.9% while Hong Kong put on 0.8%. The Nikkei in Japan was closed for a holiday. The FTSE100 is London is due to open up 1.25% according to futures trading, while the Dow Jones average on Wall Street is set to rise 0.7%. Last week saw $4tn wiped off the value of shares around the world and the US market entered into an official correction after falling more than 10% from its record level in January. Wall Street staged a late rally on Friday as the Dow Jones finished 330 points higher and the closely watched Vix index, or \u201cfear index\u201d, has dropped four points to 29 on Monday from 33 on Friday. But Bob Prince, co-chief investment officer at the $160bn US hedge fund Bridgewater, told the Financial Times on Monday (paywall): \u201cThere had been a lot of complacency built up in markets over a long time, so we don\u2019t think this shakeout will be over in a matter of days. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have a much bigger shakeout coming.\u201d David Bassanese, the chief economist at BetaShares Capital in Sydney, said in a note on Sunday that despite the big falls last week, the selling could continue. \u201cHistory suggests the depth of corrections \u2013 assuming the underlying bull market persists \u2013 don\u2019t usually get beyond 15%, so there\u2019s certainly some scope for market weakness before a bottom is reached,\u201d he said. Investors would be jittery about US inflation figures on Wednesday, he said. The market was forecasting a \u201cfairly benign\u201d 1.7% annual prices growth, but anything above that was likely to result in more stock losses. The fear of rising US bond yields and higher inflation thanks to higher wages is what sparked the current wave of selling on 2 February as investors digested the prospect of higher interest rates as a result. Chris Weston at online trader IG said on Monday: \u201cA massive buildup in market leverage has been partially unwound in the blink of an eye and what started as systematic funds selling out of equity and futures positions, as implied volatility headed higher, has morphed into something far more broad-based incorporating many other market participants.\u201d Craig James, CommSec\u2019s chief economist in Sydney, said the US rally on Friday gave cause for hope but traders were still likely to face continued volatility. \u201cWe may be a little bit softer at the start of trade on the back of the resources but overall I think it\u2019s going to be a choppy session,\u201d he said. \u201cThe volatility is still going to be with us for most of the week.\u201d Analysts at JP Morgan said in a note on Saturday they remained \u201cconstructive\u201d about world stock markets because sustainable topline growth driven by higher wages would underpin earnings and benefit shares. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index ended Friday down 0.9% at 5,838 points leaving it down 4.6% for the week.
