      "bodyText": "Margaret Thatcher famously opposed the sale of the Royal Mail, insisting that she was \"not prepared to have the Queen's head privatised\". So it is something of an irony that less than a year after the coalition government controversially sold off the venerable institution, the Royal Mail has decided to put Baroness Thatcher's head on a stamp for the first time. Thatcher is one of eight British prime ministers to feature on a set of stamps produced to mark the 200th anniversary of the office. Though some of the leaders have appeared before (notably Winston Churchill, who has twice been honoured with his own set) this will be the first time a whole series of stamps has been dedicated to prime ministers. The Thatcher stamp shows the \"iron lady\" in relaxed mode in a pale blue outfit gazing out towards the viewer on a first class stamp. Other 20th century PMs whose faces appear on the first class stamps include Churchill, splendid in spotted bow tie, and \u2013 providing political balance \u2013 the Labour leaders Clement Attlee and a pipe-smoking Harold Wilson. On the 97p stamps (for small items of airmail to Europe) are portraits of leaders from the 18th and 19th centuries: William Pitt the Younger, Charles Grey, Robert Peel and William Gladstone. Andrew Hammond, a spokesman for Royal Mail, said: \"As the UK is one of the oldest parliamentary democracies in the world, it is fitting that we mark eight individuals who have held the role over the centuries.\" Paul Lay, the editor of History Today magazine, said the selection was \"intriguing\". \"Some like Winston Churchill and William Gladstone need little introduction. Yet figures such as Charles Grey, though little known today, played crucial roles in some of British history's most important events, including the great reform act of 1832, which set the country on the path to mass democracy, and the abolition of slavery.\" He argued it was right, too, that Thatcher was honoured. \"Margaret Thatcher and Harold Wilson were major figures in important times and, whatever one's political views, deserve their place in the selection.\" Thatcher, who privatised British Gas, British Airways, British Telecom and dozens of other state-owned institutions in the 1980s, refused to countenance a sale of Royal Mail. The postal workers union CWU, which strongly opposed privatisation of the Royal Mail, politely declined to comment on whether its members would be happy delivering letters adorned by an image of Thatcher. Choosing who appears on stamps is a painstaking process. For almost 50 years, Royal Mail's special stamp programme has commemorated and celebrated events and anniversaries pertinent to UK heritage and life. It receives many hundreds of requests for subjects for its stamps every year from the public, collectors and organisations. In addition it tries to commemorate any major anniversaries and events. Royal Mail says it collates all the subjects and then carries out careful and extensive research to arrive at the final list of stamp subjects. The Queen approves all UK stamp designs before they are printed. The prime ministerial stamps will be available from 14 October. They can be bought individually or as a set in a presentation pack.",

      "bodyText": "The rate at which British pubs are closing down has accelerated to 31 a week and 3% of pubs in the suburbs have shut in the past six months, the real ale group Camra has warned. Campaigners are calling for an urgent change in the law to make it harder for pubs to be demolished or converted to supermarkets and convenience stores. The peak closure period was between January and June 2009 when 52 pubs ceased trading every week, and there are now 54,490 pubs left in the country. At the start of its annual Great British Beer Festival, Camra has launched a campaign calling for a planning application to be required before a pub is demolished or converted to another use. Pubs can currently be converted to a range of uses without planning permission. Camra says that in most cases communities have been powerless to save their locals. Tom Stainer, head of communications at Camra, said: \"Popular and profitable pubs are being left vulnerable by gaps in English planning legislation as pubs are increasingly being targeted by those wishing to take advantage of the absence of proper planning control. \"It is utterly perverse that developers are able to demolish or convert a pub into a convenience store or many other uses without any requirement to apply for planning permission. It is wrong that communities are left powerless when a popular local pub is threatened with demolition or conversion into a Tesco store.\" Camra is urging more than 55,000 festivalgoers to lobby their MPs to support a change to the law. It is hoping for a repeat of its successful campaign to scrap the beer duty escalator, which automatically increased taxes by 2% above inflation. Camra's week-long event features over 900 different real ales, ciders, perries and international beers across a total of 29 different bars. Nearly 50 MPs have already signed a parliamentary early day motion in support of closing the planning loopholes. Stephen Langdon, one of a group of locals trying to save the Maiden Over pub in Reading, which has been threatened with conversion to a Tesco supermarket, said:\"We found out just a couple of weeks ago that our valued local pub is shutting. My first thought on learning that Tesco were involved was that they would struggle to get planning permission for change of use. I was stunned when I learned that there was no requirement for this at all.\" Camra said pubs support more than a million jobs and each contributes an average of \u00a380,000 to its local economy each year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest mortgage lending data has added to the Bank of England's dilemma over interest rates after a sharp rise in borrowing showed the property market had regained its previous momentum. The number of mortgages increased in June by 4% on the previous month, suggesting that tighter borrowing criteria imposed by the financial regulator this year had only cooled the market for a few months. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said a survey of the biggest lenders showed that 60,500 house purchase loans, worth \u00a310bn, were taken out during the month, an increase of 5% by number and 6% by value on May's figures. Compared with June 2013, the figures were 15% and 23% higher respectively. More than half of those loans were taken out by home movers, although the number of first-time buyers showed a bigger month-on-month increase, making up slightly less than half of the total at 28,600. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said a continuing stream of positive data on the housing market would add to the pressure on the Bank to increase rates. \"A few more months of data showing the property market is booming and double-digit price growth will add to the pressure on the Bank,\" he said. Affordability tests, which force lenders to check applicants' outgoings as well as their income and to stress-test their borrowing to ensure they can afford repayments if interest rates increase, appeared to damp the market after they were imposed in April. The central bank is under pressure to increase rates in response to the booming economy and the sharp increase in the number of people in work. Rising house prices have also triggered calls for an increase from the current historic low base rate of 0.5% to deter buyers and take the heat out of the market. Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, is expected to say tomorrow following publication of the Bank's quarterly inflation report that a house price crash remains a risk to the recovery and policymakers must be vigilant to prevent prices getting out of control. Carney has previously argued that keeping house prices in check is possible using regulatory tools such as stricter affordability tests. While some surveys have indicated that more sellers are putting their homes on the market to take advantage of recent price increases, especially in the south east, which might keep the market from overheating, Carney could be faced with the prospect of intervening again with even tighter affordability tests or increasing rates. The CML figures showed the average first-time buyer borrowed 3.47 times their gross income to fund their purchase, compared to 3.46 in May, while the typical loan size increased by more than \u00a32,000 to \u00a3123,865. The typical gross income of a first-time buyer household also rose, to \u00a337,000 from \u00a336,500 in May. Paul Smee, director general of the CML, said: \"For the second month running since new FCA rules took effect, lending characteristics remain similar to the market beforehand. We now feel confident that, as we would hope, the mortgage market review [MMR] effect is more gentle dampener than hard brake.\" Investors' appetite for property continued to grow, with the CML reporting a 23% year-on-year increase in the number of buy-to-let loans. A total of 15,600 landlord mortgages were advanced, worth \u00a32.2bn. While the number of landlords remortgaging was up by 23% on June 2013, at 7,250, the number of owner-occupiers choosing to switch lenders was down by 8.2%, despite growing speculation that an interest rate rise could happen before the 2015 election. A total of 23,600 homeowners remortgaged during June. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said the figures suggested the new rules brought in with the MMR had not been detrimental to buyers. \"However, one area of the market which is subdued is remortgaging \u2013 all the more surprising when you consider the excellent rates available and the threat of an interest rate rise,\" he said. \"One can only assume that homeowners are either struggling to remortgage because of MMR or think it will be difficult, so aren't bothering to apply in the first place. \"Buy-to-let continues to grow as investors seek better returns than they can earn on cash and more certainty than the stock market. Lenders have been cutting buy-to-let rates and easing criteria in an effort to ensure lending volumes are not too dented post-MMR because buy-to-let doesn't come under its remit. Investors are benefitting from cheap mortgage rates, less strict criteria and plenty of demand from tenants looking for decent property to rent.\" The CML figures are for mortgages advanced during the month so reflect sales some weeks or even months before. The latest report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, due on Thursday, is expected to suggest house prices could fall in the coming months after the number of sellers increased to exceed the number of would-be buyer, the Times reported on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "Call that a sweetener? Carillion's attempt to entice Balfour Beatty back to the negotiating table was short on sugar. The basic terms were left unchanged but Balfour's shareholders would have been allowed to keep a final dividend, an adjustment worth only a few pennies. On the real bone of contention \u2013 should Parsons Brinckerhoff, Balfour's US-based design consultancy, be sold? Carillion stuck to its guns and argued for retention. Its only concession was that it would pay the bidding costs for the would-be purchasers it wants to disappoint. No surprise, then, that Balfour chairman Steve Marshall rejected the new approach. He and his colleagues are wedded to selling Parsons for the sake of firm proceeds today; a late change of strategy would be disruptive in a people-based business, they argue; and interested parties might disappear if asked to dance to Carillion's conditional tune. The Carillion view is that Parsons is one of the best pieces of Balfour and its earnings would come in handy \u2013 not necessarily for ever, but certainly during the upheaval of merging two companies with combined revenues of almost \u00a314bn. Both positions are respectable but they are irreconcilable. This deal looks dead in its current form. Resuscitation could only happen in two ways. Carillion could go hostile but that looks unlikely because cost savings (\u00a3100m-plus in the UK, say analysts) are easier to achieve on a friendly basis. Alternatively, Balfour investors could try to bully the company back into talks. But there's no sign of rebellion in the ranks. Maybe the fund managers are all on holiday. More likely, they take the pragmatic view that, even if Carillion now walks away, another bidder will turn up sooner or later if the Marshall plan to \"simplify and refocus\" Balfour doesn't produce quick results. What is clear is that Balfour needs a shot of something. First half pre-tax profits were just \u00a322m on revenues of \u00a34bn. Construction has always been a low-profit margin game but that's anaemic.",

      "body": "<p>Call that a sweetener? Carillion's attempt to entice Balfour Beatty back to the negotiating table was short on sugar. The basic terms were left unchanged but Balfour's shareholders would have been allowed to keep a final dividend, an adjustment worth only a few pennies.</p> <p>On the real bone of contention \u2013 should Parsons Brinckerhoff, Balfour's US-based design consultancy, be sold? Carillion stuck to its guns and argued for retention. Its only concession was that it would pay the bidding costs for the would-be purchasers it wants to disappoint.</p> <p>No surprise, then, that Balfour chairman Steve Marshall rejected the new approach. He and his colleagues are wedded to selling Parsons for the sake of firm proceeds today; a late change of strategy would be disruptive in a people-based business, they argue; and interested parties might disappear if asked to dance to Carillion's conditional tune.</p> <p>The Carillion view is that Parsons is one of the best pieces of Balfour and its earnings would come in handy \u2013 not necessarily for ever, but certainly during the upheaval of merging two companies with combined revenues of almost \u00a314bn.</p> <p>Both positions are respectable but they are irreconcilable. This deal looks dead in its current form. Resuscitation could only happen in two ways. Carillion could go hostile but that looks unlikely because cost savings (\u00a3100m-plus in the UK, say analysts) are easier to achieve on a friendly basis. Alternatively, Balfour investors could try to bully the company back into talks. But there's no sign of rebellion in the ranks. Maybe the fund managers are all on holiday. More likely, they take the pragmatic view that, even if Carillion now walks away, another bidder will turn up sooner or later if the Marshall plan to \"simplify and refocus\" Balfour doesn't produce quick results.</p> <p>What is clear is that Balfour needs a shot of something. First half pre-tax profits were just \u00a322m on revenues of \u00a34bn. Construction has always been a low-profit margin game but that's anaemic.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Of all the dangerous ways to take a selfie, whooshing across a concrete ramp on a skateboard is up there. But this is the House of Vans, a new subterranean skatepark in the bowels of Waterloo station in London. In its previous guise as the Old Vic Tunnels, the underground space was where intrepid audiences lapped up performances by the experimental theatre group Punchdrunk. Now, tattooed skateboarders with long hair and long shorts chase air on a vertiginous concrete bowl that to the uninitiated screams head injury. After the Old Vic vacated the old railway arches, the lease is understood to have become the subject of a fierce bidding war. Vans, a brand synonymous with skateboarding, is thought to have beaten off competition from Apple and Nike. It has taken over what is potentially a potent youth culture venue, next to London's biggest legal graffiti wall and the nearby undercroft skate park on the banks of the Thames, which was recently rescued from developers by the mayor of London. Although skateboarding has waxed and waned in popularity since the 1950s, skateboarding fashion has taken on a life of its own, with Vans' sales on track to hit $2bn (\u00a31.19bn) this year as more non-skaters embrace its uniform of chunky-soled trainers, T-shirts and hoodies. \"Vans is not only about skating \u2013 that is a very small segment \u2013 but it's the core and we will always protect it,\" says Karl Heinz Salzburger, who runs the international operation of the brand's US owner, VF Corporation. The venue, he says, will be an \"amazing vehicle to engage and inspire youth culture\". To judge from the skaters testing out its ramps at the opening last Thursday, that will mean 40-somethings as well as teenagers arriving on foot or on four wheels to attend concerts or film screenings under the cavernous arches. Vans was founded in 1966 by Paul Van Doren, a California entrepreneur who was quick to spot the growing popularity of skateboarding, developing trainers with distinctive thick soles that were perfect for gripping, and reinforced toes to cope with the friction as skaters honed their carving skills on pavements outside their homes. It lost its independence a decade ago when it was swallowed by the VF Corporation, which owns more than 30 clothing brands including the outdoor specialist The North Face and jeans labels Lee and Wrangler. But in recent years VF, which shortened its name from Vanity Fair after it sold off the lingerie brand of the same name, has been caught off guard by Vans' success, with demand for its products rocketing in the UK at the start of this decade. \"When we bought Vans in 2004 it was a $300m company,\" says Salzburger, a warm Italian who goes by the name of KH to his colleagues. \"It grew very nicely, but then three years ago it exploded. It grew too fast, which is a little bit unhealthy \u2013 we don't want to be a fashion brand because fashion is cyclical, it comes and goes.\" With so many brands under its belt VF is mindful of the need to protect its most successful names from overexposure. It has refused to supply The North Face, which last year turned over $2bn for the first time, to UK sportswear retailer Sports Direct due to its \"pile it high sell it cheap\" philosophy. \"Consumers don't know VF: there are no VF stores in the world or any advertising,\" says Salzburger, who admits even he hadn't heard of the company when it came knocking for The North Face, where he was chief executive of the European business, in 2000. \"We act and think by brand. Every brand has an organisation and sometimes a physical home: Vans sits in southern California, whereas The North Face is in northern California. We always plan group marketing, sales, retail and product development by brand to make sure it makes sense to its consumers wherever they are.\" Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence at the trend forecaster WGSN, seconds the strategy. \"VF understands that you can't mess with the brand, that the brand is owned by the community who use it and that they can sniff out inauthenticity,\" she says. \"It's about how skilful you are as a management house and VF have quite an enlightened way of managing brands. They are always questioning what to do and trying to innovate.\" The formula seems to work. VF, which also owns Timberland, JanSport, Eastpak and Reef, recently set a new target to increase sales from last year's $11.4bn to $17.3bn by 2017. VF's skill in fostering nascent demand for its products is perhaps most apparent in China, where it is helping to invent an outdoors culture to dress in The North Face gear, as there is no tradition of weekend yomps. Sponsorship of endurance races and expeditions up Haba mountain helped produce sales growth of more than 20% in Asia Pacific last year.",

Poundshop.com was launched by Poundland founder Steve Smith and Poundworld back in February. But the pair failed to reach a \u201cshared vision\u201d according to Poundworld\u2019s spinners, and the latter is now going to launch a rival online venture. Poundworld.com perhaps?</p> <p>It is not clear if the decision was a result of Poundshop.com seeking to extend its product range outside that of its backer and supplier Poundworld. Retail Week reported in June:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Poundland co-founder Steve Smith, who runs the online business with Poundworld, said he is looking to extend its online offer through other parties that can sell products for a pound .</p> <p>Smith said: \u201cWe\u2019d like to see a lot more products on the site. We would like to double the size of the range. We have about 1,000 lines online at the moment and we could easily have 2,000 to 3,000.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Poundshop.com was one of the first single-price point retailers to sell online. Others have struggled to make it work, as average transaction values are low. Poundshop.com has tackled this issue by imposing a minimum \u00a310 spend on orders. Retail Week wrote:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although Poundworld declined to give any sales figures for the website, Smith said Poundshop.com customers on average spend \u00a330 per transaction, above the anticipated \u00a323 at this stage.

Thanks for all your comments. It seems the UK\u2019s first online pound shop is struggling, with key partner Poundworld pulling out of the venture just six months after launch. Warning, this is about to get very confusing. Poundshop.com was launched by Poundland founder Steve Smith and Poundworld back in February. But the pair failed to reach a \u201cshared vision\u201d according to Poundworld\u2019s spinners, and the latter is now going to launch a rival online venture. Poundworld.com perhaps? It is not clear if the decision was a result of Poundshop.com seeking to extend its product range outside that of its backer and supplier Poundworld. Retail Week reported in June: Poundland co-founder Steve Smith, who runs the online business with Poundworld, said he is looking to extend its online offer through other parties that can sell products for a pound . Smith said: \u201cWe\u2019d like to see a lot more products on the site. We would like to double the size of the range. We have about 1,000 lines online at the moment and we could easily have 2,000 to 3,000.\u201d Poundshop.com was one of the first single-price point retailers to sell online. Others have struggled to make it work, as average transaction values are low. Poundshop.com has tackled this issue by imposing a minimum \u00a310 spend on orders. Retail Week wrote: Although Poundworld declined to give any sales figures for the website, Smith said Poundshop.com customers on average spend \u00a330 per transaction, above the anticipated \u00a323 at this stage. Its largest order has been \u00a3700. Smith revealed that small businesses have been placing orders, such as hairdressers purchasing shampoo in bulk.

A wry take from the Moscow Times about the joys of buckwheat, in light of Russia\u2019s ban on food from the west. The journalist writes: In fact, buckwheat \u2014 \u0433\u0440\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430 (grechka) in Russian \u2014 is not only a delicious staple of the Eastern European diet, it is highly versatile. It can be eaten for breakfast, for lunch and for dinner without ever getting monotonous. The supposed easing of tensions in Ukraine is already looking premature. Reuters quotes a NATO chief saying there is a \u201chigh probability\u201d of Russian intervention in East Ukraine. Adrian Croft writes: NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday he saw a \u201chigh probability\u201d that Russia could intervene militarily in eastern Ukraine and that NATO saw no sign that Moscow was pulling back its forces from close to the Ukrainian border. \u201cWe see the Russians developing the narrative and the pretext for such an operation under the guise of a humanitarian operation and we see a military build-up that could be used to condcut such illegal military operations in Ukraine,\u201d he said. A separate Reuters snap headline reads: Leader of East Ukraine rebels Zakharchenko says mulls counter-attack on government forces in 2-3 days. The FT has a nice take on the BuzzFeed fundraising, which valued the news site famed for its lists at $850m. Under the headline \u2018You\u2019ll never guess how much BuzzFeed raised from Horowitz\u2019, Henry Mance writes up the fundraising, in a list, of course: OK, maybe you will If you guess $50m. BuzzFeed\u2019s new investor is one of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-known venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz. This is literally what happens when you create an INSANELY DISRUPTIVE news service. 2. There\u2019s more The investment values BuzzFeed at $850m, the New York Times reported. Or $850,000,000.00. Or more than three times what Jeff Bezos paid for the Washington Post or nearly half the New York Times Company\u2019s own enterprise value. Let\u2019s all salute a start-up founded in 2006, which was reportedly worth less than $200m in January 2012. Revenues are expected to exceed $100m this year, Andreessen Horowitz said. 3. Orphaned pygmy hippos that are looking directly at you Yes, every article about BuzzFeed must mention that their LISTS ARE CHAMPAGNE FOR THE EYES. But honestly, that\u2019s cool because the site has also been hiring political reporters and is beefing up its foreign coverage.

While traders seem less concerned about the crises around the world, the situation in Iraq continues to unfold, with Iraqi prime minister Nuri al-Maliki battling to keep his job today. Follow the developments on Matthew Weaver\u2019s live blog. Markets continue to rise, as fickle traders decide not to worry about geopolitical risks. FTSE 100 up 0.8%, 55 points at 6622 Germany\u2019s DAX up 1.6% France\u2019s CAC up 0.9% Spain\u2019s IBEX up 0.7% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 0.5% There\u2019s more evidence of Angela Merkel\u2019s extraordinary staying power. The only leader, among the major eurozone countries, to survive the financial crisis, her popularity continues to rise. That contrasts sharply with the woefully unpopular French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Oil prices have eased again, after a spike on Friday as Islamic State fighters came within striking distance of Iraq\u2019s oilfields. Brent crude slipped below $105 on Monday, as traders grew less concerned about the crisis in Iraq. Carsten Fritsch, senior oil and commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt said: The oil market is not as worried now about what is happening in Iraq. the market has become more complacent about supply again. But complacency is dangerous. Given the geopolitical tensions, a spike in oil prices cannot and should not be ruled out. RBS has told Reuters that it is exploring options, including a possible sale or joint venture, for the international arm of Coutts, the Queen\u2019s bank (see below). The announcement reiterates a report in the FT in July. Martin Arnold in London and Jennifer Hughes wrote: Royal Bank of Scotland is considering selling the overseas operations of Coutts, its private banking arm, which includes the Queen among its clients, as it conducts a strategic review of its wealth management business. The private bank, founded in 1692, is being integrated with RBS\u2019s UK commercial lending division as part of a strategic overhaul of the partly state-owned group announced in February. Alison Rose, head of the new commercial and private banking division, is leading the review and is expected to announce her strategy for the business at an investor day as early as September. RBS said: \u201cWe announced in February that Coutts will sit within our commercial and private banking division, where we can better connect it with the successful entrepreneurs and growth businesses who are creating wealth. \u201cAs part of the transition and integration of this business, we have been reviewing our private banking business so that it works for the benefit of our customers.\u201d Germany and Japan\u2019s economies are losing steam, according to Paris-based think tank the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD said growth momentum in most major developed economies was stable, but Germany and Japan were flagging. Its growth indicator, designed to flag up turning points in the economic cycle, was unchanged in June at 100.5. But growth lost momentum in Germany, where the indicator dropped to 100.2 in June from 100.4 in May; and Japan, where it fell to 100.1 from 100.4 the previous month. One point worth noting about the UK\u2019s mortgage data (see below) is that it appears that the tough new rules on lending to house buyers have not put a hard brake on the market. Lenders are reporting a steady rise in first-time buyers despite the changes. The new rules - known as the Mortgage Market Review (MMR) - came into effect at the end of April. Paul Smee, director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said: For the second month running since new FCA rules took effect, lending characteristics remain similar to the market beforehand. We now feel confident that, as we would hope, the MMR effect is more gentle dampener than hard brake. Wholesale gas prices are rising, on the back of an unplanned outage at a North Sea gas field, cooler weather on the way, and concerns about the transit of gas from Russia via Ukraine. Day-ahead UK gas prices rose by 1p to 38.5p a therm. Forecasts suggest temperatures are about to fall below the seasonal average over the next two weeks, driving demand for gas. Mortgage lending rose 6% in June to \u00a317.9bn, according to Bank of England data. That\u2019s 20% higher than June last year. Lending is driven by housebuyers, rather than people remortgaging their houses, says the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Lending to first-time buyers increased 19% on June last year. The number of remortgages dropped 8% over the year, although the value was up 6%. My colleague Hilary Osborne will have more on that shortly. Royal Bank of Scotland is looking to sell the international arm of its private bank, Coutts, Reuters is reporting, citing unnamed sources. It said RBS has attracted a variety of offers form a range of bidders for Coutts International, including \u201cundisclosed Asian and North American parties for a business which manages roughly 40 billion Swiss francs in client assets\u201d. The international unit employs 1,200 staff. Reuters says its sale means RBS plans to maintain the British arm of its private bank, which counts the Queen among its clients. The energy market regulator Ofgem is feeling the heat after five former electricity and gas industry regulators said its actions contributed to the profit and price increases made by the Big Six energy firms. The regulator rejected the charges this morning. It blames the former \u2018watchdogs\u2019 for causing the current problems and says its actions had made the market simpler, fairer and clearer. Roland Gribben of the Telegraph writes: The former regulators, responsible for controlling prices and supervising the operations of gas and electricity companies after privatisation, included Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator from 1989-99, Sir Callum McCarthy (electricity) and Clare Spottiswoode, the second gas industry regulator. In a joint submission to the Competition and Markets Authority, released today, they maintain that Ofgem may have weakened competition in the market through poorly designed regulatory procedures introduced since 2008. Their submission is part of an 18-month probe into the energy market, which was, in fact, requested by Ofgem, after it decided that millions of households were paying too much for their gas and electricity because of a lack of competition across the sector. Gribben writes: In a statement Ofgem said many of the current problems with retail competition were showing before 2008 and pointed out that the regulatory and policy environment had changed significantly over the last six years. The global economic recovery has been \u201cdisappointing\u2019 and could signal lower growth in the long-run, the vice chair of the US Fed will say in Sweden today. Stanley Fischer will tell an economic conference: The global recovery has been disappointing. With few exceptions, growth in the advanced economies has underperformed expectations of growth as economies exited from recession. These disappointments in output performance have not only led to repeated downward revisions of forecasts for short-term growth, but also to a general reassessment of longer-run growth. The IMF\u2019s expectation for long-run global growth is now a full percentage point below what it was immediately before the Global Financial Crisis. This reconsideration reflects lower projected growth for both the advanced and the emerging market economies. But the economic climate in Europe remains uncertain. Italy fell back into recession last week and there are fears that sanctions between Russia and the west will hit the German economy. In terms of economic data, markets will be focused on Chinese figures out on Wednesday after last week\u2019s which shock trade data, which shoed exports to the euro area jump 14% in July. There\u2019s unemployment and average earnings data out in the UK, also on Wednesday, along with the inflation report. This will all be picked over for any clues as to when the Bank of England might raise rates from their historic low of 0.5%. Current betting is for late this year or early in 2015. The markets have opened higher, as expected. The FTSE 100 up 0.5%, or 32 points at 6599 German DAX up 1.1% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 1.2% Spain\u2019s IBEX up 1.2% France\u2019s CAC 40 up 0.6% In the UK, infrastructure company Balfour Beatty has rejected an offer to merge with Carillion in order to protect the ongoing sale of its US subsidiary. My colleague Jennifer Rankin reports: Balfour Beatty announced it had \u201clost confidence\u201d in merger talks, after Carillion badgered them not to sell its US division Parsons Brinckerhoff. Talks broke down in late July over the future of design and engineering business Parsons Brinckerhoff, after Carillion surprised Balfour with a plan to keep the company in a combined business. Carillion had been pressing Balfour to resume talks, but Balfour rejected a merger for endangering the sale of Parsons Brinckerhoff, a company it acquired in 2009, but felt had failed to perform. The company feared a failed sale \u201cwould materially impact the motivation and retention of Parsons Brinckerhoff management and employees\u201d. It looks like Amazon has fallen into another contract dispute, this time with Disney. The WSJ reports that Amazon halted preorders for some DVDs and Blu-ray discs from Disney , including popular titles such as \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\u201d. Greg Bensinger writes: The online retailer is restricting customers\u2019 ability to preorder physical copies of the films, promising to notify them when they become available. It is a tactic Amazon has used several times this year, including with Time Warner\u2019s Warner Bros. studio, before reaching a resolution earlier this year, as well as a continuing spat with Hachette Book Group. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment, but the company said early Saturday thatwithholding preorders of Hachette titles and slowing shipment of others was necessary to achieve its contract goals. \u201cHachette spent three months stonewalling and only grudgingly began to even acknowledge our concerns when we took action to reduce sales of their titles in our store,\u201d Amazon said in a letter it posted to one of its websites. In corporate news, a bidding war looks likely to break out over the company behind Penfolds Wine. Reuters is reporting that private equity giant TPG Capital Management made a $3.1bn approach for Treasury Wine Estates, following KKR and Rhone Capital\u2019s offer for the group. A week after KKR and Rhone Capital LLC proposed a A$5.20 a share offer for Treasury, the owner of the Penfolds, Lindemans and Wolf Blass brands said on Monday it received a second identical unsolicited approach from a global private equity firm which requested anonymity. But the crisis is far from over. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets notes: It remains far too early to celebrate any de-escalation between Russia and Ukraine. Only at the weekend Ukraine claimed it had thwarted a covert attempt by Russian soldiers to enter the east of the country under the guise of a humanitarian mission with the Red Cross. While Russia dismissed the claims as a \u201cfairy tale\u201d, they nonetheless speak to the concerns that Kiev has with respect to Russia\u2019s next move. Global stock markets have bounced on hopes that tensions in Ukraine are easing. Russia announced on Friday that its military exercises near Ukraine\u2019s border were over, overshadowing concerns about the US air strikes in Iraq. The S&amp;P and Dow Jones both finished the week on a high note, rising by more than 1%. Japanese stocks followed them higher, posting their largest one-day gain in four months today. The Nikkei jumped 2.4% recouping most of its losses from Friday.",

      "bodyText": "Balfour Beatty, the UK's largest construction firm, has rejected a second merger approach from its much smaller rival Carillion, saying the \u00a33bn deal would be too risky. Balfour Beatty had been under pressure from Carillion to resume talks, but remained unhappy with Carillion's plan that it should call off the sale of Parsons Brinckerhoff, its US design and engineering business. Talks between the two construction firms, which are both involved in building the east London overground train line, broke down in late July over the future of Parsons Brinckerhoff after Carillion surprised Balfour Beatty with a plan to keep the company in a combined business. Speaking after failed peacemaking talks over the weekend, Steve Marshall, executive chair of Balfour Beatty, said Carillion's renewed overture had failed to address its concerns over the deal. \"The value risk to Balfour Beatty shareholders from a failed auction or from the merger proposal failing to proceed has been largely unaddressed in this revised [Carillion] proposal,\" he said. Balfour Beatty bought Parsons Brinckerhoff in 2009 in what remains its largest acquisition to date. The UK construction company announced it was looking to sell the consulting company in May, after deciding it wanted to focus on its core construction business. As well as the disagreement over Parsons Brinckerhoff, Marshall said the Balfour Beatty board also saw substantial financial and operational risks in a merger. In a separate announcement Balfour Beatty, which built the aquatic centre at London's Olympic Park and is overhauling the Olympic stadium, reported that pre-tax profits for the first six months of 2014 had halved to \u00a322m, as it continues to grapple with problems in its UK mechanical and electrical business. Balfour Beatty, which operates in 80 countries, has been struggling since the financial crisis with a lack of work in the UK and the cancellation of major projects in Australia. The company has issued four profit warnings in two years, culminating in the ousting of chief executive Andrew McNaughton in May. While housebuilding has been booming over the last year, the large-scale engineering and construction projects that are Balfour Beatty's specialism typically lag 18 months behind an economic recovery. Marshall said Balfour Beatty had started to see \"a progressive ripple of recovery in our regional business\" and forecast an overall improvement over the next three-to-four years. However, he indicated the firm is expecting potential job losses as part of \"a managed rather than a dramatic downsizing\". Marshall did not give details on redundancies and Parsons Brinckerhoff is the only Balfour Beatty business up for sale. The Parsons Brinckerhoff deal is expected to net shareholders \u00a3200m and be completed within two months. But some analysts have questioned the decision to sell Parsons Brinckerhoff before the recruitment of a new chief executive. Anthony Codling at Jefferies, the building investment group, said the decision to sell Parsons Brinckerhoff would be \"the biggest strategic decision the company is going to make in the next five years\" and could deter potential candidates from the chief executive role. \"Are you fishing in a smaller pool of talent with those conditions. I would argue that you probably are. It is odd to make that decision when you are without a CEO.\" Parsons Brinckerhoff was described by Codling as \"the jewel in the crown\", as the consulting trade is seen as a more reliable source of income, compared with the more volatile construction business. Balfour Beatty said its order book was stable at \u00a313bn, although the reported number was 1% down on last year as a result of the strong pound. The FTSE 250 company saw its share price rise 1.4% to 240p, following the decision to call off merger talks. Marshall said the board would consider any future merger proposals, as it is legally obliged to do, but he added: \"The key thing we are going to be talking about \u2026 is the future of a standalone Balfour Beatty. We are very confident the plans we have got are going to take the company forward.\" Under UK takeover rules, Carillion has until 21 August to renew its advances. The company said on Monday it would give further consideration to its position, adding: \"There can be no certainty that any offer will be made by Carillion or as to the terms on which any such offer might be made.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ofgem has hit back at claims it may be partly to blame for high prices, after a group of former regulators said it had presided over a weakening of competition in the energy market. The energy regulator said it had introduced the \"most radical set of reforms\" to protect consumers in the retail energy market since competition began, after five former senior officials raised concerns about poorly designed regulation. The rising cost of household energy has been a political flashpoint ever since Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged at last year's party conference to freeze prices and \"reset\" the market. Competition authorities have since embarked on the largest-ever investigation of the UK energy market to check claims that the big six energy companies have been profiteering. But in a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority, which is conducting the investigation, five former energy regulators expressed concern Ofgem may have unwittingly contributed to the problem of weak competition and high prices. The submission, signed by Clare Spottiswoode, a former head of Ofgas, and Stephen Smith, who was a senior executive at Ofgem as recently as 2010, also urged the CMA to keep Ofgem staff off the investigation team to ensure impartiality. Another signatory, Stephen Littlechild, who was head of electricity regulator Offer from 1989 to 1998, told the Sunday Telegraph he believed Ofgem had inadvertently weakened competition, citing the regulator's own figures showing the profits of the big six suppliers had risen from \u00a3233m in 2009 to \u00a31.1bn in 2012. \"I am not taking a view as to whether profits are at the right level or not, all I'm saying is they have gone up consistently since Ofgem started intervening in the market,\" he said. The five signatories, who also include Eileen Marshall \u2013 who held a series of senior roles at Offer, and Sir Callum McCarthy, a former head of Ofgem, have combined experience of regulating energy markets from 1989-2010 and describe the creation of competition in the retail energy market as \"one of the great successes of energy privatisation\", which has been \"copied throughout the world\". After their intervention was made public on Monday, an Ofgem spokesman rejected claims that regulation had been lax. \"There certainly has been tight enough regulation. One of the chief examples of that is that when energy companies have broken the rules we have taken tough action against them. We have levied more than \u00a3100m in fines and redress on energy companies since April 2010, so compliance is something we take very seriously,\" he said. They added one person was seconded to the CMA investigation and that the regulator had a role to provide sector-specific expertise. \"The investigation is fully independent of Ofgem, and a completely fresh look at the market.\" One year ago Ofgem introduced measures forcing energy companies to simplify energy and gas tariffs for consumers, as part of a broader shakeup that the spokesman described as \"the most radical set of reforms that have ever been introduced in the retail market since competition began\". In 2008, following a previous investigation into the energy market, Ofgem banned differential pricing in a bid to stop customers of the same energy company paying much higher tariffs in different parts of the country. Pointing to this policy, the five ex-regulators said regulation in the domestic energy market \"started to take a radically different path in 2008\", adding that \"questions have been raised, including by some of us, as to the appropriateness and effectiveness of a number of these interventions\". The submission goes on to raise the concern that regulation could have deterred new entrants and increased costs for consumers and suppliers. Ofgem said it would \"pay close attention to the views of past energy regulators, as we do to all views and opinions that might contribute to better future performance\". The regulator added: \"Referring the energy market to the CMA will help to ensure that no stone is left unturned to make sure that competition is bearing down as hard as possible on prices.\" Ofgem has been fighting accusations that it is a toothless tiger, while firms such as British Gas and SSE face claims of profiteering in a market described as broken by business lobby groups. Figures from the Department for Energy and Climate Change published by Labour earlier this year suggested little competitive pressure on the big six. When the figures were published in March, SSE, E.ON and RWE npower held exactly the same market share in gas now as they did more than five years ago, while British Gas had seen little challenge to its market-leading position over the period.",
