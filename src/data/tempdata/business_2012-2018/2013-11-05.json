The government and Britain's largest defence contractor are preparing to announce a restructuring of BAE's yards in Portsmouth as well as at Scotstoun and Govan in Glasgow, with statements due to be made later this week. . It is understood that there will be a commitment to the future of shipbuilding on the river Clyde \u2013 a politically sensitive issue with the 2014 Scottish independence referendum looming \u2013 but there will still be job losses at the two Scottish sites, which employ 3,200 people. However, ship construction is widely expected to cease at Portsmouth naval base, where 1,200 employees have worked on building hull sections for the HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carriers. The cuts come after BAE Systems has experienced the biggest peak in UK shipbuilding since the second world war, led by the \u00a35.4bn aircraft carrier programme that that saw BAE share its allocation of the work across Portsmouth, Govan and Scotstoun.

      "body": "<p>Strange things are afoot at Ryanair. Shareholders have complained about the airline's image. Profits are set to dip for the first time in five years. The ever-rising share price has finally tumbled. And chief executive Michael O'Leary, the man the flying public most loves to hate, has embraced customer service. Investors have been posing a previously unthinkable question. Has O'Leary screwed up?</p> <p>In the wake of a second profits warning that saw about \u00a330m wiped off his own personal paper wealth in Ryanair shares, O'Leary admits he made mistakes and will be imitating easyJet in reshaping his company. There will be a year of \"evolution\" after \"running like lunatics\" for the last two decades of extraordinary growth.</p> <p>The airline is making changes, as O'Leary put it, to: \"Stop unnecessarily pissing people off.\" It is ending the scramble to board, relaxing baggage policy, toning down onboard selling and softening penalties for customer errors. But it is the apparent culture change \u2013 to \"new, cuddly Ryanair\" \u2013 that has grabbed the headlines.</p> <p>\"If I'd known it was going to generate this much free PR, I'd have done it years ago,\" says O'Leary, 52, who in a strategy based on ferocious cost control has played the jester-cum-villain throughout Ryanair's ascent.</p> <p>\"An awful lot of what I did over the years is generate lots of cheap, free publicity, because we're in the business of generating cheap, free publicity.</p> <p>\"When you're growing rapidly it's enough to be able to just open up new routes, make noise \u2013 charge you for toilets, standing room, we'll adopt any measure going as long as it generates fucking cheap publicity, banning people from charging mobile phones. Grand. We'd go at almost anything.</p> <p>\"Now we're not opening up new markets, actually that's the wrong message. Now we need to address those repeat flyers and say look, better on-time performance than ever, better customer service, we're addressing those issues you wanted to address \u2026 We're listening to you. We're responding to your needs, God help me. The Robin Hood fucking stuff does need to change. We need to move away from making noise and actually start communicating with people.\"</p> <p>For all that he courted the publicity, some of the bad press belatedly rankles. \"There's enormous imbalance in a lot of the coverage we get. Why are we carrying 81 million passengers if we're this terrible? Yes, we have the lowest fares, we have brand new aircraft, we have the most on-time flights \u2013 it sounds like kind of a fucking Mormon, Moonie session \u2013 but we do.\"</p> <p>The allegedly gentler Ryanair first emerged in July when shareholders at the annual meeting in Dublin complained that the airline's image was costing it and the chief executive admitted responsibility for a \"macho culture\" that had to change.</p> <p>Now, though, O'Leary claims the change of tack in the airline he has run since 1994 was due less to shareholder concerns than an inevitable stage in Ryanair's progress, as it awaits the first deliveries of 175 new planes from Boeing.</p> <p>\"We opened up seven new bases last year. There'll be almost no new bases this year. OK, so what makes news this year? The great thing was this focus on customer service, O'Leary's Sauline conversion, me apologising for my character flaws. The AGM: one guy asked one question: why do you fight, why are we fighting so many people?</p> <p>\"You'd swear the AGM went on for three days of interaction. But if that's the appetite in the media, for those kind of stories, we'll run with it. Ryanair on Google news \u2013 it's all fucking Damascene conversion, Sauline conversion. I guess we were torturing people for the last 20 years.\"</p> <p>Yet there will be, he insists, fundamental changes to the business model. \"It'll have to evolve, be a different Ryanair. It can't always be cheeky fucking chappie and in your face. We've been running like fucking lunatics for the last 20 years. So, a bit of pause: what needs to be addressed?\"</p> <p>\"We've had an approach to the website that it's cheap, way cheaper than the competition so people will still put up with almost any amount of irritation \u2013 17 bloody clicks to book a ticket, and yet 81million people still book a ticket. But that's not acceptable. He admits that in luring business passengers and in online booking facilities, Ryanair had slipped behind easyJet. But now? \"Anything easyJet can do, we can do better and cheaper \u2026 if we get all these issues addressed, we start taking new aircraft next September, start expanding, there will be new routes. We build a bigger, better Ryanair.\" That will include flying to more city centre airports rather than distant airfields \u2013 another advantage long claimed by easyJet.</p> <p>So did he get it wrong? \"I think I made lots of small mistakes. But we're good at actually identifying where we're going wrong and checking back. Anyone who says he doesn't make mistakes is a fool. You can't not make mistakes in this business, 'cos you're always trying things.</p> <p>\"It was easier to be dismissive of some of those things because we were growing so fast. It doesn't matter. More routes, new aircraft, low fares. Pile them high, flog 'em cheap.\"</p> <p>O'Leary, having previously derided social media, recently took enthusiastically to Twitter. \"It allows us to interact better with our customers, and understand genuinely what annoys them and what doesn't,\" he says. Barely a year ago, he notoriously dismissed the half million people on Facebook who backed a customer's complaint over a boarding pass reissue charge of several hundred euros by calling it \"her fuck-up\". Now, though, he says: \"We do need to improve. One of the things we've been very conscious of with the Spanish and some of the Italian handling agents, this kind of rubbish: the baggage fits but the wheels stick out. For fuck's sake, it gets on. Stop fighting with people over bullshit like a handle sticking out.\" Didn't those strictures come from O'Leary? \"Absolutely not. I wish I had that power to issue edicts and they were automatically followed.\"</p> <p>Yet analysts say nothing happens at Ryanair without O'Leary's stamp. Andrew Lobbenberg of HSBC says: \"It's a business run by firm edict from the top.\"</p> <p>At some level, it is clear that O'Leary, for all his talk of feedback, does not entirely accept his airline still has a problem with customer service.</p> <p>Bringing up a recent Which? survey that named Ryanair the worst brand for customer service, O'Leary fulminates: \"I think you have to have enough cop on to say look that survey's irrelevant. Yet it keeps being peddled, Ryanair's the most hated brand. What the hell are you surveying? 99% of people don't think what's my favourite brand, they look for the cheapest fares. If Which? surveys were the way forward, BA would be booming.\"</p> <p>Much customer dissatisfaction is \"apocryphal and anecdotal\", he claims, saying the airline responds to complaints in seven days. \"Things go wrong for very few people flying Ryanair. But what we do is exactly what BA do. I see far more British Airways passengers stranded at Heathrow when they had the snow last year \u2026 Does BA ferry them all to local hotels? No they don't! They're all sleeping in the terminal.\" (A BA spokesman said that in fact the airline paid in full for transfers and accommodation.)</p> <p>O'Leary adds: \"BA have warehouses all over Europe of lost bags that they can't redeliver to anybody. We don't.\" (BA: \"Absolute rubbish.\")</p> <p>Nor has O'Leary's attitude to passengers entirely changed. \"I guarantee 90% of negative feedback will come from people who are in breach of the policies they agreed to abide by. It's not that we want your money, we don't want your bloody gate bags. Show up with a 55 by 30 by 20 and you're fine, you're on. Stop whining afterwards if you show up with a suitcase that's bigger than that.\"</p> <p>While the boarding pass reissue fee will be cut to \u00a315, the \u00a370 charge for not checking in online stays: \"Because you broke the rules. If you don't turn up at the airport without a passport, why the hell do you show up without the boarding pass?\"</p> <p>O'Leary breaks off for a TV news interview, having his Remembrance Day poppy adjusted. Is this poppy-wearing part of the new O'Leary? He looks briefly, genuinely cross. \"In percentage terms far more fucking Irish guys were killed in the two world wars than English guys. I always wear them.\"</p> <p>So is O'Leary's own position in doubt? HSBC's Lobbenberg tips shares to bounce back up and rise further, saying that moves to imitate easyJet, however clumsy, are overdue and will bear fruit.</p> <p>Douglas McNeill, investment director at Charles Stanley said: \"They'll still make a half billion of euros this year in profit, they've three billion of cash in the bank and score highly on many things that customers care about.

      "bodyText": "Must-have budget fashion and bigger stores have triggered a surge in sales and profits at Primark this year. The retail chain, which is part of the Associated British Foods group, saw a 22% rise in revenues to \u00a34.27bn in the year to September, boosting underlying profits by 44% to \u00a3514m. Like-for-like sales, stripping out the impact of new store openings, rose 5%, a marked difference to the slip at bigger rival Marks &amp; Spencer, which is struggling to attract younger shoppers into its clothing aisles. \"Primark continues to take off like a rocket, but the turnaround of Marks &amp; Spencer continues to be a bit of damp squib,\" said Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst. While M&amp;S pointed to a market heavily reliant on discounting during an unseasonably warm autumn, Primark said its autumn/winter ranges were selling well with few promotions after a strong summer helped by great weather. It added that sales of the autumn/winter range in the new financial year were encouraging with strong demand particularly for slim-fitting chinos, zip hoodies and tartan fashions. Shoppers were spending even in Ireland, where M&amp;S is closing stores. George Weston, chief executive of ABF, said it was a remarkable year for the fashion retailer and prospects for the future looked good. Primark has stocked up on novelty Christmas jumpers after selling out last year but still expects its famous onesies to sell well again. Weston said sales of onesies were doing particularly well in Germany where 11 of the top 15 stores for onesie sales were located. \"We think its going to be another onesie Christmas,\" he said. Primark's performance comes despite having no online store after abandoning a test with internet fashion specialist ASOS earlier this year. Weston said the trial had proved it was very difficult to make money online at Primark's price points. He said: \"I think we can compete on the high street with others selling online. Our business model is not being undercut by cheap clothes on the internet.\" While other fashion chains are trimming their high street estates, Primark is adding more than a million square feet of selling space in the new financial year, with 13 store openings planned in time for this Christmas, including five in Spain and its first store in France, which will open in Marseille. The continued success of Primark comes despite its links to the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh in April, which killed more than 1,100 workers. A Primark supplier occupied the second floor of the eight storey building. Weston said that Primark had placed its last order with such \"multi-use\" factories and was working closely with other retailers in the Accord on Fire &amp; Building Safety in Bangladesh to ensure safety at its 80 factories there. ABF's group revenue rose 9% to \u00a313.3bn for the full year, while pre-tax profit rose 15% to \u00a3876m.",

In thousands of pages released to encourage bondholders to back the rescue package, the Co-op also admitted it is likely to design share-based bonus schemes for its bosses after its shares are floated on the stock market next year. The Co-op Group is to give up full ownership of the bank under the rescue deal. The bank also warned that it could face a significant VAT bill once the group's ownership falls to 30%. This is because it has service arrangements with the group. Because of its ethical policy, the Co-op bank has been regarded as a major competitor to the big four \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC \u2013 and a potential winner from the rapid switching service which promises to move a current account in seven working days without any errors. Euan Sutherland, the boss of the Co-op Group, has said the bank's 4.7 million customers have remained loyal since the announcement in June that it had been ordered by the Bank of England to find extra capital to bolster its financial strength. The Co-op bank lost \u00a31.4 bn in deposits from corporate customers after its credit rating was downgraded to junk status in May. The former chairman of the bank, the Rev Paul Flowers, is likely to face questions from MPs about assertions in the 2012 annual report that the bank's financial position was strong, just weeks before regulators unearthed the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall. He is due to appear before the Treasury select committee on Wednesday. The Co-op Group said it was co-operating with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the accounting body the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) which are looking at the bank's statements about its capital position in the report. The group made clear inquiries are at a preliminary stage and it is not a formal investigation. The FCA declined to elaborate, while the FRC said: \"We are making inquiries into the Co-op's financial reporting in accordance with our normal procedures. If we commence a formal investigation we always issue a press announcement.\" A group of bondholders - which hold class of bond known as upper tier 2 bonds \u2013 have come out in support of the complex rescue offer, which if it fails could force the bank into the control of the Bank of England and possibly nationalisation. Holders of 15% of such bonds have said they back the offer.",

      "bodyText": "The new boss of embattled security group G4S has accused the company's former management of \"undermining\" the firm's values and contributing to a string of high-profile debacles such as last year's notoriously mis-managed Olympics contract. The comments were made as chief executive Ashley Almanza attempted to spell out why the group should not bow to activist shareholders and split up the company. After extensive changes at the top over the past year, he said, the company would stick to its existing strategy. Almanza said: \"The company has got values. One of the reassuring things \u2026 is that the employees understand the core values and they are committed to those values. They are deeply committed to customer service, but as a whole, I don't think as a management team we always applied those values in a concentrated way \u2026 I think from time to time it has caused us to take actions that have undermined some of our core values.\" Almanza cited the debacle over last year's contract to handle security at the London games, when the army and police were drafted in to fill the gaps left by G4S's failure to provide enough security guards. The high-profile embarrassment has not been an isolated case, with other crises at the company including a current Serious Fraud Office criminal investigation into allegations of overcharging on electronic tagging contracts for offenders; a South African maximum security prison being taken over by local authorities after allegations that G4S staff \"lost effective control of the facility\"; and, most controversially, July's ruling that G4S security guards unlawfully killed Angolan deportee Jimmy Mubenga three years ago. Former chief executive Nick Buckles survived the Olympics debacle, as well as an aborted \u00a35.2bn bid for Danish cleaning company ISS in 2011, but finally left the company in May with a \u00a31.2m payoff after the company issued a profit warning. He was replaced by Almanza, who had only joined from BG Group three weeks earlier as chief financial officer. In his first five months in the role, the new chief executive said he had travelled around the world visiting distant parts of the company, which operates in more than 120 countries and has around 620,000 employees. But, despite the range of problems to have emerged at G4S, he concluded that there was no need for major changes to the business plan. \"The core strategy's unchanged. The core service lines are unchanged and our market positions are unchanged,\" he said, before adding that senior management had been overhauled and the company would now \"execute\" differently. \"We have a new chairman, we have a new chief executive and a new chief financial officer. We have three new independent directors on the board \u2013 all effectively in the last 12 months or so. So six of the 11 main board directors are new. In the executive team, we have five changes to our [11] executive committee positions.\" Almanza announced plans to sell or restructure 35 poorly performing businesses, which generated around \u00a3400m of G4S's \u00a37.3bn revenue last year and have lower profit margins than the rest of the group. Any proceeds from sales are earmarked for investment in emerging markets, which are growing more quickly. The company also revealed that it would be cutting 250-400 UK jobs, out of around 45,000, as part of a \"previously announced \u00a330-35m restructuring programme\". Cevian Capital, a \u00a35bn activist investment fund, has recently emerged as a major G4S shareholder, increasing speculation in the City that Almanza is coming under pressure to dispose of G4S's troubled cash business. That division \u2013 which provides services such as replenishing cash machines and accounts for about 18% of the group's revenues \u2013 has attracted an approach from Charterhouse Capital, although G4S quickly rejected the offer on the grounds that the price of \u00a31.55bn was too low and that the unit was strategically vital to the group and not for sale.",

We expect it to move below 7% by mid-2015, a year ahead of the Bank of England's current forecast. However, given the positive developments in the last couple of months, the Bank is likely to downgrade its unemployment forecast in its next Inflation Report due next Wednesday. This will probably be accompanied with upward revisions to growth as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers, World First, said:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The services sector is flying.&#xa0;Records in both output and employment have guided the PMI to the highest level since Tony Blair took power in the UK back in 1997, as confidence around the long-term ability for recovery continues to increase. Combined with the manufacturing figure from Friday and yesterday\u2019s 6 year record construction number, we can safely say that momentum is firmly gathering in the UK economy. The wind is very much in our sails.</p> <p>We would have to say that growth is now running at close to 5% on an annualised basis, on these initial estimates, and, at the moment, shows little sign of abating. We must now wait for the Bank of England\u2019s appraisal of this run of numbers. There will be a fair few of the economic fraternity of who will be looking forward to next week\u2019s Quarterly Inflation Report and expecting some form of outlook change from the MPC; a change that will see rates rising sooner than the 2016 expectation that was originally forecast\u2026</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andy Scott, associate director at HiFX:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following positive surprises in the manufacturing and construction sector indexes, the early indicators for the fourth quarter look like 2013 could see the economy grow at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Markit, the company that measures and releases the data for all three sectors, said that combining the three indexes points to GDP growth this quarter of 1.3%. This should serve to ease some concerns that have arisen over the past few weeks that the recovery won\u2019t be sustained. The buoyancy of the housing market where prices have been rising steadily helped by increasing mortgage approvals and the government\u2019s help to buy scheme has been what a lot of commentators have put the recovery down to but clearly it\u2019s broader based. With unemployment continuing to fall at a modest but steady pace, confidence will be maintained which should boost consumer spending and corporate investment. </p> </blockquote> <h2>And here's our full story:&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/05/service-sector-growing-at-fastest-pace-since-1997\">Service sector growing at fastest pace since 1997</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5278c878e4b08cac6a3300fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:29:47.754Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">MPs grill Wonga: Payday lenders admit making changes</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Wonga has also admitted it was forced to make changes to its sales practices following an Office of Fair Trading investigation,as the hearing before MPs continued...</strong></p> <p>It was told to highlight risk factors more prominently on its website and make clearer disclosures around APRs (percentage interest rates).</p> <p><strong>QuickQuid</strong> and <strong>Mr Lender</strong> admits that they have been ordered by the Office of Fair Trading to change their procedures on 'roll overs' where hard-pressed borrowers ask for a loan to be rolled over at the end of the term.</p> <p>In total, Mr Lender admits that it was told to make around 30 changes to its procedures.&#xa0;</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:31:44.278Z\">at 10.31am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5278c778e4b00d1cb164472b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-05T10:28:59.928Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back to parliament, and&#xa0;MPs are pressing payday lenders on how they check whether borrowers can afford a payday loan. </strong></p> <p>Adam Freeman, chief executive of Mr Lender, admits that it has no idea if a borrower is taking out new loans from Wonga or other lenders at the same time.&#xa0;</p> <p>He gives an example of a person taking home \u00a31,500 a month with \u00a3600 left after rent and other expenses.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We might then lend them \u00a3300 or \u00a3350.

Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. European markets have closed, and it has indeed been a downbeat day, not helped by the European Commission lowering its growth forecast for the eurozone, and lingering concerns about when quantitative easing will end. The closing scores were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 16.78 points or 0.25% lower at 6746.84 \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.31% at 9009.11 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.82% lower at4253.34 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended down 1.13% at 19,091.93 \u2022 Spain's Ibex lost 0.79% to 9795.7 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 0.13% or 19 points. As we head to the close, markets are still falling back. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: [In Europe] the mining sector has been the best performing sector today after Chinese HSBC services data pointed to a fairly constructive outlook for the Chinese economy in the short term. But this hasn\u2019t been enough to keep equity markets higher, as the EU downgraded its growth forecasts for the euro area in 2014, while German car maker BMW has helped drag the DAX lower after profits fell back. US markets opened lower this morning taking their lead from today\u2019s weakness in Europe as investor\u2019s exercised caution ahead of some key data later this week. It would appear that US markets are reluctant to push higher while investors absorb the different statements from various Fed policymakers, Here's a good piece by economist Shaun Richards about the challenges facing the European Central Bank as it prepares for its monthly meeting on monetary policy. He runs through the various options facing the ECB to address falling inflation, lacklustre growth and stubbornly high unemployment. We are experiencing an era where politicians mostly delegate economic policy to central banks who have emerged blinking into the light from the shadows where in my view they belong. Why have they done this? Well in a perversion of President John F Kennedy\u2019s famous statement about going to the Moon they have delegated the job because it is hard, rather than being inspired. More here: Will the European Central Bank panic on Thursday? Back in Greece...troika officials faced angry protests as they left the finance ministry after their first meeting with the Greek government, hours after coins were thrown at IMF mission chief Poul Thomsen as he arrived. There were scuffles between demonstrators and police as Thomsen and colleagues left the meeting with finance minister Yannis Stournaras. Many of the protestors were ministry cleaners who face dismissal as part of Greece's cuts to its public sector. Associated Press reports that the Troika officials had to be spirited out of the building through an emergency exit, after protesting civil servants blocked the lifts and main entrance to the ministry. They had earlier tried to disrupt the meeting by chanting anti-austerity slogans outside the room where it took place America's service sector has followed Britain's by reporting that activity picked up pace in October, although the increase wasn't as dramatic. The ISM survey of service sector activity rose to 55.4, from 54.4 in September, showing activity picked up. Firms also hired more workers. But there were also signs that last month's government shutdown did hit firms, with the new orders index dropping to its lowest level since July. (a reminder - the UK service sector PMI hit 62.5 in October, the highest level since May 1997) Date for the diary - Italian Senators will vote on November 27 on whether to expel centre-right leader Silvio Berlusconi from parliament over his conviction for tax fraud, officials said (via Reuters). Time for a round-up of the main events of the day so far. \u2022 The European Commission has lowered its growth forecast for the eurozone next year, predicting that GDP will rise by just 1.1% in 2014, not 1.2%. The EC's latest Autumn Forecasts also predicted weak growth and above-target deficits in several countries worst hit by the eurozone crisis. Commissioner Olli Rehn said Europe had begun growing again, adding it was too early to claim \"victory\" in the financial crisis. He also warned that Slovenia must work hard to clean up its banking sector, Key points from Rehn's press conference are here. The EC also predicted that inflation will remain subdued at 1.5% in 2014 and 1.4% in 2015, adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to ease monetary policy. \u2022 The OECD has also flagged up the personal harm caused by the crisis. A new report found that 'well-being' has dived by 20% in Greece and is also sharply lower in Spain and Italy. Britain, though, scored pretty highly on its measure of places to live. \u2022 Britain's service firms have posted their strongest growth in 16 years. Activity in the dominant sector rose by the highest rate since Tony and Cherie strolled through Downing Street in May 1997. City economists say it shows the UK economy is growing strongly at present. \u2022 MPs have heard that payday lenders are targeting young children with their TV adverts, and causing a sharp rise in debt problems, at a hearing into the industry. \u2022 Greece's government has begun the latest round of talks with its lenders over its bailout programme. IMF chief Poul Thomsen had coins thrown at him as he arrived at the Athens finance ministry, but was apparently unhurt. Talks will centre on the size of Greece's fiscal gap for next year, and how it will be closed. Last night, PM Antonis Samaras ruled out pay and pension cuts, or tax rises. Insiders say the Troika will also push for changes at Greece's defence industry, and could demand that two loss-making firms are closed. \u2022 Stock markets have fallen in Europe, following the EC's lowered growth forecasts. Falling operating profits at BMW and increased storm related losses at RSA Insurance also hit the main share indices. Here's some depressing lunchtime reading -- personal well-being, and trust in our elected leaders, have both slumped in those European countries hit hardest by the financial crisis. So warns the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in a new report, which found that people in struggling eurozone countries have suffered much more than others in the developed world since the financial crisis began The OECD has reported that average life satisfaction declined by more than 20% in Greece between 2007 and 2012, 12% in Spain, and 10% in Italy. However, moderate increases were recorded in Germany (+4%), along with Israel, Russia, Mexico and Sweden. Citizens in the hardest-hit euro area countries have lost trust in their governments and institutions. the OECD added (no surprise to regular reader). The percentage of people in these countries claiming to trust national government fell by 10 percentage points between 2007 and 2012. In the OECD countries as a whole, less than half of those surveyed said they trusted their governments - the lowest level recorded since 2006. OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00eda said the report should be \"a wake-up call to us all\u201d, adding: It is a reminder that the central purpose of economic policies is to improve people\u2019s lives. We need to rethink how to place people\u2019s needs at the heart of policy-making. While unemployment has clearly driven down life satisfaction, many people in work across Europe suffer from inadequate circumstances, the OECD found: Achieving the right balance between requirements and opportunities drives people\u2019s commitment at work, and is key to strengthening their capacity to cope with demanding jobs. In Europe, 50% of persons who face poor work organisation and workplace relationships report that their job impairs their health, compared with only 15% among those experiencing favourable conditions. With appropriate resources and support, even highly demanding jobs can be fulfilling. But without them, the accumulation of stress factors in the workplace frequently leads to health problems. The full report is here: How's Life 2013 Perhaps more surprisingly, the OECD has declared that the UK is a great place to live and work, despite rising inequality. It found that Britain ranks above average on jobs, earnings and housing in its Better Life Index - but below average on education, skills and income equality. Economics reporter Katie Allen explains: The UK is one of best places to live and work, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, although income inequality has risen by more than in other countries since the global financial crisis struck in 2007. The Paris-based thinktank has been seeking to measure wellbeing for the 34 nations of the OECD, based on aspects of life such as incomes, education, housing and security. It says the UK ranks above the OECD country average on environmental quality, personal security, jobs and earnings and housing among other measures. It is close to average for work-life balance, but below in education and skills. More here: UK scores highly in world quality of life rankings, says OECD Reuters is reporting that European regulators are close to fining several banks for rigging Euribor -- the rate at which banks would lend to each other in euros. Barclays will apparently avoid a fine after blowing the whistle on the issue. But JP Morgan, RBS, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, SocGen and Credit Agricole all face penalties. The first fines could be announced in December, although some banks are still fighting them. Here's the snaps: 05-Nov-2013 13:12 - EXCLUSIVE-EU ANTITRUST AUTHORITY SET TO FINE JP MORGAN, RBS AND DEUTSCHE BANK FOR SUSPECTED FIXING OF EURIBOR INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK - SOURCE 05-Nov-2013 13:12 - HSBC, SOCIETE GENERALE AND CREDIT AGRICOLE WILL ALSO BE PENALISED FOR EURIBOR RIGGING - SOURCE 05-Nov-2013 13:12 - BRITAIN'S BARCLAY'S TO AVOID FINE AFTER ALERTING EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO THE SUSPECTED WRONGDOING - SOURCE 05-Nov-2013 13:12 - FINES EXPECTED TO BE AT LOW END OF COMMISSION'S LIMIT OF UP TO 10 PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S GLOBAL REVENUE 05-Nov-2013 13:12 - SOME BANKS READY TO SETTLE, WILL RECEIVE 10 PERCENT REDUCTION IN FINE, OTHERS CHALLENGING THE PENALTIES 05-Nov-2013 13:12 - FINES LIKELY TO TOTAL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF EUROS WITH FIRST DECISION NEXT MONTH Martin Lewis's suggestion that payday loan adverts should be banned from children's programmes has received plenty of attention -- here's a selection, starting with a tweet from the MP for Worcester, Robin Walker: Greece's troika of lenders received a pretty rough welcome at the start of their talks with the Greek government over its bailout programme. One man has been detained by police after throwing coins at the head of the International Monetary Fund's delegation, Poul Thomsen. Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports that the man was immediately arrested after sending a barrage of coinage at the IMF mission chief's car as it arrived at the finance ministry this morning. He was driven to Athens' central police HQ - although it remains unclear as yet if he has been charged, Helena adds. The Kathimerini newspaper reports that Thomsen ducked as the volley came his way, and wasn't hit. Associated Press reports that a few dozen civil servants \"armed with a bullhorn\" chanted anti-austerity slogans Tuesday outside the room where the Troika officials were meeting Finance Ministry Yannis Stournaras. AP adds: Ministry officials said the protesters, who work for a Development Ministry department in the building, did not enter the room and left peacefully. European stock markets are in the red today, with traders pinning some blame on the EC's newly lowered growth forecasts. Toby Morris, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, commented: European stocks have retreated from 5 year highs after the European Commission lowered the zone\u2019s growth forecast. The zone\u2019s economy is expected to shrink by 0.4% this year before recovering to 1.1% in 2014, revised lower from 1.2%. The revision is a further reminder of the hurdles still facing a European recovery, expecting near record levels of unemployment to remain until 2015. Investors aren't too impressed by recent financial earnings either. I flagged up earlier that BMW had disappointed investors with a drop in operating profits. It's not alone -- as Reuters explains: Half way into the European earnings season, 52 percent of STOXX Europe 600 .STOXX companies have missed profit forecasts, and two thirds have missed revenue forecasts, according to data from Thomson Reuters StarMine, a sharp contrast with the second-quarter result season during which only 42 percent of companies missed profit forecasts. Insurance firm RSA is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 after warning that weather-related claims will be bigger than expected. More here: RSA Insurance shares swept away after recent storms Here's the situation: FTSE 100: down 38 points at 6725, -0.5% German DAX: down 56 points at 8980, - 0.6% French CAC: down 35 points at 4253, - 0.8% Jo Swinson MP, Minister for Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs has told MPs that the voluntary code of conduct followed by payday lenders is not being complied with. She said: One in five [of people taking out a payday loan] are not asked about affordability, rising to 60% when rolling over a loan. The industry is not taking its responsibilities anywhere near as seriously as it should be doing. The OFT says the pressure it has put on the industry has removed 19 out of 50 payday lenders, and that three firms have had their licences formally revoked. Another two, unnamed firms, are at an \"advanced stage\" of action by the OFT (via Patrick Collinson again). More key points from the parliamentary hearing into the Payday loan industry. Debt charities and advice organisations are telling MPs that the number of people coming to them with payday loan problems has \"exploded\" over the past two years. Peter Tutton, head of policy at StepChange, says: We have seen an eightfold increase in the number of people with pay day loan problems. The average debt is \u00a31,600 when the average income is \u00a31,200. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice says her figures are even higher: At Citizens Advice we have seen a 10-fold increase in people coming to us with payday loan issues. Many of them are paying off the debt by taking out further debt. Our tracker survey of 3000 people [with payday loans] shows that over 60% of these people did not have adequate affordability checks when taking out a loan, and 94% of them did not have affordability checks on rollover loans. MPs have been told that children are being 'groomed' by payday lenders, according to Martin Lewis of moneysavingexpert.com, who is calling for a complete ban on advertising of the controversial loans from children's television*. My colleague Patrick Collinson reports that Lewis told the BIS committee's inquiry into payday lenders: \"They have created the demand for pay day loans, and now they are saying it is what people want. Figures we are releasing this morning show that 14% of parents of under-10 year olds, when they tell their children they can't have a toy, they have the TV advert [for a loan] quoted back to them. We have normalised a niche form of lending.\" * UPDATE: Here's a full statement on the call for a ban from children's programmes Richard Lloyd, executive director, Which?, says its figures also show that younger adults are being drawn into payday loans: \"In total, our figures suggest that 4% of the population are taking a payday loan each month, but among 18-29 year olds it is 7%.\" And here's a chart showing the EC's latest growth forecasts by country (sorry if it's too blurry: the original is on page 12 of this pdf) Worth noting that the EC expects the UK to grow by 2.2% next year, well ahead of the eurozone forecast of +1.1%, the EU average of +1.4%, or the 1.7% growth seen in Germany. Back to the European Commission's new economic forecasts, in which it lowered its forecast for 2014 slightly to a 1.1% rise in GDP, from 1.2%. The full report can be seen here. Commissioner Olli Rehn has just held a press conference on the report (video recording here), in which he struck an upbeat tone - saying Europe had now returned to growth. The whole report is 177 pages, and packed with detail. Brussels' correspondents, though, have been chewing through it quickly and quizzing Rehn. Peter Spiegel of the FT, and Matthew Dalton of the WSJ, have tweeted the key points: Back at the parliamentary committee hearing into Wonga and its rivals.... TV money guru Martin Lewis of moneysavingexpert.com is comprehensively attacking the payday loan industry. Lewis said: If you take 100 people seeking a loan, 99 of them can find a better and cheaper alternative than a payday loan. They are not fit for purpose... there is a desert of regulation... I'm not convinced about the ethics of the business model. People think its a financial play, but this is a technology play. It allows you, while you are pissed and want to gamble at 11.30 at night, to get a loan. It just needs to be slower... the instant, hi tech nature of how they operate is very dangerous. See 10.07am and 10.28am for earlier key points from the hearing Another sign of weakness in the eurozone economy -- producer prices (a measure of what factories charge for their goods) rose by just 0.1% in September, after being flat in August. It underlines the limited inflationary pressures across the region -- which could prompt the European Central Bank to cut interest rates on Thursday. Nick Beecroft, chairman of Saxo Capital Markets, argued last night that the ECB has all the evidence it needs: The past week has brought news of dangerously low inflation in Germany. We have also learnt that German retail sales plunged in September, Eurozone unemployment edged up by 0.2 percent to 12.2 percent and the Consumer Price Index across the Eurozone is estimated to have risen by only 0.7 percent in the past year. The euro has always had the potential to become a deflationary disaster and now it looks like Japanisation is upon the continent. Zombie banks are kept alive via the pernicious LTRO Ponzi so that they can buy their national governments\u2019 bonds and labour reforms are proceeding at a snail\u2019s pace. City analysts are rather impressed by the news that UK service sector has posted its strongest growth in 16 years (details here) Nida Ali, economic advisor to the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club, said the the services sector has started the fourth quarter \"with a bang\" (makes a change from those damn fireworks): These figures beat even the most optimistic expectations, as most commentators, after strong out turns in the past couple of months, were expecting the pace of services growth to slow in October..... The strong increase in employment supports our view that the unemployment rate is on track to drop below the 7% forward guidance threshold well ahead of schedule. We expect it to move below 7% by mid-2015, a year ahead of the Bank of England's current forecast. However, given the positive developments in the last couple of months, the Bank is likely to downgrade its unemployment forecast in its next Inflation Report due next Wednesday. This will probably be accompanied with upward revisions to growth as well. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers, World First, said: The services sector is flying. Records in both output and employment have guided the PMI to the highest level since Tony Blair took power in the UK back in 1997, as confidence around the long-term ability for recovery continues to increase. Combined with the manufacturing figure from Friday and yesterday\u2019s 6 year record construction number, we can safely say that momentum is firmly gathering in the UK economy. The wind is very much in our sails. We would have to say that growth is now running at close to 5% on an annualised basis, on these initial estimates, and, at the moment, shows little sign of abating. We must now wait for the Bank of England\u2019s appraisal of this run of numbers. There will be a fair few of the economic fraternity of who will be looking forward to next week\u2019s Quarterly Inflation Report and expecting some form of outlook change from the MPC; a change that will see rates rising sooner than the 2016 expectation that was originally forecast\u2026 Andy Scott, associate director at HiFX: Following positive surprises in the manufacturing and construction sector indexes, the early indicators for the fourth quarter look like 2013 could see the economy grow at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis. Markit, the company that measures and releases the data for all three sectors, said that combining the three indexes points to GDP growth this quarter of 1.3%. This should serve to ease some concerns that have arisen over the past few weeks that the recovery won\u2019t be sustained. The buoyancy of the housing market where prices have been rising steadily helped by increasing mortgage approvals and the government\u2019s help to buy scheme has been what a lot of commentators have put the recovery down to but clearly it\u2019s broader based. With unemployment continuing to fall at a modest but steady pace, confidence will be maintained which should boost consumer spending and corporate investment. And here's our full story: Service sector growing at fastest pace since 1997 Wonga has also admitted it was forced to make changes to its sales practices following an Office of Fair Trading investigation,as the hearing before MPs continued... It was told to highlight risk factors more prominently on its website and make clearer disclosures around APRs (percentage interest rates). QuickQuid and Mr Lender admits that they have been ordered by the Office of Fair Trading to change their procedures on 'roll overs' where hard-pressed borrowers ask for a loan to be rolled over at the end of the term. In total, Mr Lender admits that it was told to make around 30 changes to its procedures. Back to parliament, and MPs are pressing payday lenders on how they check whether borrowers can afford a payday loan. Adam Freeman, chief executive of Mr Lender, admits that it has no idea if a borrower is taking out new loans from Wonga or other lenders at the same time. He gives an example of a person taking home \u00a31,500 a month with \u00a3600 left after rent and other expenses. We might then lend them \u00a3300 or \u00a3350. But we don't know if at the same time they have gone to Wonga for a loan. Wonga's head of public affaris Henry Raine says it uses 'raw data' from agency Call Credit to assess borrowers and, without explaining further, says \"we look at how people interact with the slides and the screen.\" (via Patrick Collinson - whose first report from the BIS committee is here) While Britain's service sector is booming (see here), the eurozone economy is weaker than Brussels had hoped. The European Commission has trimmed its growth forecast for 2014 to +1.1%, down from +1.2%, admitting that private demand and investment will not increase as much as it had hoped. The growth rate is expected to rise to 1.7% in 2015. It also sees little end to Europe's jobless crisis, predicting that the eurozone unemployment rate will hit 12.2% for 2013, remain there in 2014, before dipping to 11.8% in 2015. Olli Rehn, commissioner for economic affairs, commented: There are increasing signs that the European economy has reached a turning point, But it is too early to declare victory: unemployment remains at unacceptably high levels. That's why we must continue working to modernise the European economy. The EC's latest report also predicts that public debt levels across the eurozone will peak at 95.9% of GDP next year, up from 95.5% in 2015. The annual deficit for the euro area is expected to drop to 2.5% in 2014, and then to 2.4% in 2015, from 3.1% this year. But annual borrowing levels will be higher in many of the countries worst affected by the crisis -- where economies were driven into deep recessions by tough austerity policies. Here's the details: \u2022 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS FRENCH DEFICIT AT 4.1% OF GDP IN 2013, 3.8% IN 2014, 3.7% IN 2015 \u2022 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS ITALIAN DEFICIT AT 3.0% OF GDP IN 2013, 2.7% IN 2014, 2.5% IN 2015 \u2022EU COMMISSION FORECASTS SPANISH DEFICIT AT 6.8% OF GDP IN 2013, 5.9% IN 2014, 6.6% IN 2015 \u2022EU COMMISSION FORECASTS GREEK DEFICIT AT 13.5% OF GDP IN 2013, 2.0% IN 2014, 1.1% IN 2015 \u2022 EU COMMISSION FORECASTS PORTUGUESE DEFICIT AT 5.9% OF GDP IN 2013, 4.0% IN 2014, 2.5% IN 2015 \u2022EU COMMISSION FORECASTS CYPRUS DEFICIT AT 8.3% OF GDP IN 2013, 8.4% IN 2014, 6.3% IN 2015 Sony Kapoor of the ReDefine thinktank tweets that the forecasts show that European leaders should not be talking about the crisis being over, even though the risk of the euro breaking up has receded. As expected, Wonga has been defending itself before the Business, Innovation and Skills select committee (the grilling is being streamed here): My colleague Patrick Collinson has the details: Wonga's head of regulatory and public affairs, Henry Raine, told a select committee of MPs this morning that only 9% of its 1.25m customers fail to repay loans, and that the vast majority of its customers repay take moderate sized loans (\u00a3270 on average) and that only one in 15 roll over their loans. The committee hearings come after the premiere last night of Wonga's feature length film portraying happy customers. More details of the film is here.... Stella Creasy, now Labour's shadow minister for competition and consumer affairs, said this morning the film should perhaps be called \"Legal loansharking is a Wonderful Life\" (Patrick continues) She said: \u201cWonga may be able to find twelve people to say they are happy customers, I can find 1200 who are not and who are now paying the price for borrowing from these legal loan sharks. They like to claim they are different from other payday lenders, but the truth is they are all as bad as each other. That isn't my review, but the outcome of the Office of Fair Trading investigation which found the entire payday lending industry in Britain was out of control. That\u2019s why they have written to 50 legal loan sharks including Wonga about their behaviour. If Wonga really want to be transparent about how they make a million pounds a week from lending to hard pressed Brits, they should own up to being warned by the OFT and spell out what they are doing to put that right, rather than filling our cinema screens with such fiction.\u201d Over to Greece again... where our correspondent Helena Smith says behind the scenes Greek officials are expressing concerns that the country\u2019s ailing defence industries are going to be the real rubbing point when negotiations with its lenders begin at noon (see details here) While much of the saga over resumption of talks has focused on the reluctance of the government to enact any more \u201chorizontal cuts,\u201d officials privately admit that the real issue is the pressure creditors are exerting on Athens to close the country\u2019s ailing defence industries. Lenders had demanded that two notoriously loss-making armaments firms, the Hellenic Defense Systems (EAS) and the Hellenic Vehicle Industry (ELVO), as well as a mining company, LARCO, be shut down back in September \u2013 seeing the closures as \u201cprior actions\u201d that were necessary to unlock the next tranche of aid \u2013 at 1 bn euro vital to paying public sector pay checks and pensions. Apparently incensed that the government has followed through with neither action, they have signalled that the closures will be the focus of today\u2019s finance ministry talks. \u201cIt\u2019s the real sticking point because it will mean the loss of thousands of jobs,\u201d said one source at the ministry. \u201cThey basically want us to streamline EAS to the point that we only have one factory left that can produce kit for our own army but not enough to export abroad.\u201d As south east Europe\u2019s only EU member state, government officials say it is a \u201cmatter of pride\u201d that the Hellenic Defense Industry is kept alive. \u201cAs an issue it\u2019s much hotter than most people think because it\u2019s one of national pride.\u201d Stunning results from the UK service industry -- activity across the dominant sector has hit its fastest rate in 16 years. Markit reported that the monthly service sector PMI soared to 62.5 in October, up from September's 60.3, and well ahead of economists' forecasts for a fall to 59.8. Markit said it shows that UK recovery was gathering pace. We've also had strong results from the manufacturing and construction industries for last month -- showing record increases in output, employment, new business and backlogs of work. In total, it suggests that the UK economy is currently growing at a remarkably strong quarterly rate of 1.3%, Markit said, up sharply from previous quarters (UK GDP rose by 0.% in the last quarter). Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: The UK economic recovery moved up a gear again in October. Manufacturing, services and construction all continued to see very strong rates of expansion, pointing to an ongoing broad-based upturn. However it is the services sector which, due to its sheer size, is the major driving force. Service sector activity hasn't risen this strongly since May 1997..... The news sent the pound romping higher, up 0.5% or 0.7 of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.604. Such strong data may encourage the Bank of England to raise its growth forecasts -- and could also bring an interest rate rise closer. Here's some instant reaction: The full report on October's PMI report is here. Hopes that the Spanish labour market is healing have been dealt a blow this morning, with the news that the jobless total rose by 87,028 in October. Seasonal factors are to blame, as the tourism season came to a close. But the increase is worse than the 82,500 increase that some analysts expected, even though Spain's recession may be over. On a more positive note, though, the jobless total looks to be lower than a year ago: Heads-up: the parliamentary Business, Innovation and Skills committee has begun its hearing into the UK payday loans industry. It's being streamed live here: Committee chair Adrian Bailey has asked Wonga, QuickQuid and Mr Lender to explain why they have such a bad reputation..... We'll have the answers shortly. Payday lender Wonga got its retaliation in first last night, ahead of the parliamentary hearing in payday lenders which begins at 9.15am GMT (so in 15 minutes). Here's the details: Chief operating officer Niall Wass warned against \"jumping to conclusions\" about his company, which has come under fire over the way it treats customers. \"I am not sitting here today saying that everything we do is perfect; what we are trying to do is use great technology to give a really fair, transparent service to customers,\" he said in an interview with ITV News At 10. Wass challenged the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, who has criticised the payday loan companies, to use Wonga services. \"What I am asking him and others to do \u2013 go use the service, see if you think it is fair and transparent, take out \u00a330 for 10 days, pay it back after a week and then judge us by our customers,\" he said. His remarks came as Wonga made a film showing the positive experience of the \"silent majority\" of its customers, ahead of a session in the House of Commons when MPs will question payday loan companies. Representatives from Wonga, QuickQuid and Mr Lender \u2013 three of the biggest payday lending firms \u2013 will appear before the Commons Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee. MPs are expected to follow up on a damning report by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) which found \"deep-rooted\" problems in the way payday loans attract and treat customers. More here: Wonga defends its 'fair, transparent service' ahead of committee hearing Worth noting that Wonga will be represented by its top PR man -- Henry Raine, head of regulatory and public affairs, rather than CEO Errol Damelin, or Wass. Elsewhere in the corporate world, and hundreds of jobs are at risk at G4S as the security firms looks to rebuild its fortunes. CEO Ashley Almanza told reporters this morning that between 250 and 400 jobs at its 'UK cash business' will be cut over the next 18 months. He also explains that 35 G4S businesses have been identified as under-performing -- the company will now decide whether to invest in them, shake them up, or sell them off. As Reuters reports: \u2022 G4S CEO SAYS 250-400 JOBS IN UK CASH BUSINESS TO BE CUT OVER NEXT 18 MONTHS \u2022 G4S SAYS 35 BUSINESSES GLOBALLY IDENTIFIED AS UNDERPERFORMING, WILL NOW DECIDE WHETHER TO GROW, RESTRUCTURE OR EXIT THEM \u2022 G4S GFS.L CEO SAYS CONFIDENT WILL RESTORE COMPANY'S REPUTATION IN UK The shake-up comes a day after the Serious Fraud Office announced it was holding a criminal investigation into the electronic offender tagging contract run by G4S and Serco, following claims that they billed for monitoring people who were back in prison, outside the UK, or deceased. Investors in RSA Insurance are also feeling the autumnal chill this morning - its shares are down 5.5% after it warned that its losses from bad weather will be materially higher than expected. CEO Simon Lees said 2013 had been an \"exceptionally tough year for weather events\" for RSA, with hefty insurance claims from Canada and Northern Europe. Over the summer we saw the worst and the third worst natural catastrophe insurance events on record in Canada, followed by continued adverse weather across the country during the third quarter. More recently, Northern Europe suffered a severe windstorm on 27 and 28 October. Our priority has been to provide the support our customers need to get back on track as quickly as possible. Shares in German carmaker BMW have fallen by over 3% in early trading, after it reported that operating profits have dropped by 6% in the last quarter. BMW blamed the cost of new technology, and also cited the fragile European economy (where car sales have been spluttering for the last two years). BMW said: Despite some signs of stabilization on European car markets, economic conditions in many markets are likely to remain volatile and challenging in the coming months. Back in the UK, a leading think tank has warned that the British economy remains too reliant on squeezed consumers as the recovery picks up. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) sounded the alarm as it predicted the growth rate will increase to 2.0% in 2014 (up from its August forecast of 1.8%). It also reckons GDP will rise by 1.4% this year (compared with 1.2% three months ago). My colleague Katie Allen reports: \"After two years of stagnation, economic growth has returned, underpinned by an increase in consumer spending,\" the thinktank said. \"Consumer spending growth is necessary for an economic recovery in the UK, but a consumer-driven recovery will not be 'balanced', let alone one reflecting the required long-term 'rebalancing' towards an economy with greater net national saving.\" More here: UK growth to pick up in 2014 \u2013 NIESR Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras tried to calm fears over the return of the country's international lenders, in a TV appearance last night. Samaras insisted that his ministers will not be fighting the troika when talks resume today , saying: First of all let me say something - let's do away with this notion that we are in some kind of war...It is a negotiation. Samaras also argued that it was possible to close Greece's fiscal gap in 2014, and achieve its goal of a primary surplus, without even more austerity. Wages and pensions will not be cut, and tax will not rise, he pledged, adding: Society cannot take it, the economy cannot take it, and it is not even required by the country's current financial situation. The meetings between the Greek government and its lenders begin at noon local time (10am GMT), when finance minister Yannis Stournaras sits down with the mission chiefs from the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Those talks are likely to focus on the shortfall in Greece's 2014 budget. Athens says it is just \u20ac500m, but the Troika estimate it at \u20ac2.5bn. Another meeting takes place four hours later with labour minister Yiannis Vroutsis. Greek newspaper Kathimerini has the details: Labor Minister Yiannis Vroutsis is scheduled to meet the envoys at 4 p.m. for talks likely to focus on the country\u2019s problematic social security funds whose deficits have contributed to the fiscal gap. Both ministers indicated in recent days that they are bracing for extremely difficult talks. Asked by reporters on Monday night whether he would stick to Greece\u2019s estimate of next year\u2019s fiscal gap \u2013 which at 500 million euros is a fraction of the troika\u2019s 2.5-billion-euro estimate \u2013 Stournaras appeared defiant. \u201cWe have submitted a budget, a draft,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have sent data to show that this draft is realistic and we insist on this,\u201d he said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. Plenty of events to keep us busy today. The Greek government begins fresh talks with its international lenders in Athens. Top of the agenda -- the question of how much of a 'fiscal gap' Greece faces in 2014, and how this shortfall should be addressed. Prime minister Antonis Samaras pledged last night that his government and the Troika will keep working together, but this week's talks are likely to be pretty tense. More on this shortly.... Payday lenders including Wonga face a grilling at parliament, when they appear before the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee. MPs will demand answers on how they attract and treat their customers. That starts at 9.15am. We're also deep into the European earnings season, with a range of companies reporting this morning. The early signs are mixed -- Marks &amp; Spencer has reported another fall in clothing and homeware sales (down 1.3% between July and September), while Primark has posted much more impressive figures. Insurance group RSA has warned that 'severe weather events' during 2013 have been more costly than expected. Imperial Tobacco, though, has posted higher profits and hiked its dividend by 10%. Chairman Iain Napier is stepping down too. And security firm G4S is announcing its new strategy this morning, after a pretty dire 16 months that began with its failure to handle the London Olympic security contract. In the economics world, we find out how Britain's service sector performed last month at 9.30am GMT -- can it match yesterday's strong performance from the construction sector? The European Commission is also due to release updated economic growth forecasts, at 10am GMT. And central banks will also be in focus, after the Reserve Bank of Australia voted to leave interest rates unchanged early this morning. In two days time, the European Central Bank must decide whether to react to the eurozone's falling inflation and rising unemployment, and ease monetary policy. Many economists think it should -- not all are convinced it will. I'll be tracking all the main events though the day as usual.",

Social housing earnings continue to richen as competitors struggle (driving supply-chain consolidation), visibility of revenues improve (maintenance over capital) and [last year's purchase] Morrison synergies are secured. In care, the recent acquisition of ILS and contract wins should help move the group further up the acuity chain.

Among the miners, Anglo American added 41.5p to \u00a315.36, while Antofagasta was 25.5p better at 889p and Rio Tinto rose 41p to 3330.5p. Shares in pharmaceuticals group Shire hit an all time high of \u00a328.92 after news one of its drugs was successful in treating binge eating. The company said Vyvanse, used in cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had proved superior to a placebo in reducing binge eating in two late stage trials. It now plans to submit an application to US regulator the Food and Drug Administration for approval of the drug by the third quarter of next year. Shire fell back from its highs but still closed 38p better at \u00a328.58. Among the mid-caps CSR, which specialises in Bluetooth wireless technology, closed 28p lower at 518p after a weaker than expected forecast for the fourth quarter. Drax dropped 14.5p to 634p after the House of Lords passed an amendment to the Energy bill on Monday, applying emission performance standards to existing coal fired power stations as well as new ones. Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital said: The impact on Drax and the other coal power station operators is unclear and the amendment may be over turned in the Commons. But if it stands this must be a negative for Drax in particular. Mears, the social housing and care specialist, rose 4% to 438p after an in line trading update showing a \u00a33bn order pipeline. The company has also sold its mechanical and electrical business to its management for just \u00a31. Mears will receive \u00a37m if the business is subsequently sold on. Analyst Andrew Nussey at Peel Hunt issued a buy note, saying: The net impact [of the disposal] is to remove \u00a31m of losses expected to be incurred in December 2014 and a freeing up of management time to focus on the core activities. Exceptionals (non-cash) of \u00a317.5m will be incurred in 2013. Overall, we still believe the group investment case for Mears continues to strengthen. Social housing earnings continue to richen as competitors struggle (driving supply-chain consolidation), visibility of revenues improve (maintenance over capital) and [last year's purchase] Morrison synergies are secured. In care, the recent acquisition of ILS and contract wins should help move the group further up the acuity chain. The earnings visibility (15% compound annual growth rate), the potential for double-digit organic growth, the attractive returns on capital (20% plus) and the strategic options the group faces would suggest scope for outperformance. Lower down the market telecoms group Coms added 0.025p to 3.525p as it paid \u00a39.5m for the information technology and communications businesses of Aim-listed Redstone, whose clients include Cisco, IBM and Hewlett Packard. Finally LiteBulb, whose Ila safely products and Scootrix children's scooters are sold through the likes of Asda and Tesco, lost 7% to 0.765p after announcing a \u00a33m placing at 0.7p a share to fund the purchase of smaller product development company Meld. Entrepreneurs Nigel Wray and Andrew Black, co-founder of Betfair, are both backing the placing. Analysts at finnCap said: We upgrade our adjusted pretax profit for 2014 from \u00a31.5m to \u00a32.4m and introduce a 2015 forecast of \u00a33.5m. Our target price remains at 1p for now.",

After a year-long consultation, the Financial Conduct Authority has strengthened the listing regulations for major companies to give minority shareholders additional voting rights and greater influence over key decisions. But the regulator has stopped short of demanding an increase in the free float - the amount of shares available to trade - from the current 25%. The rules apply to any company where there is a controlling shareholding of 30% or more, and will include businesses such as Sports Direct International and Associated British Foods. Around 50 leading companies will be bound by the new rules. The regulator said the companies involved would have to sign an agreement to ensure they can operate independently from their majority shareholder. The agreement would give independent shareholders a veto over transactions between the business and its main investor. Independent directors would have to be approved by a vote of all investors and a separate vote of independent shareholders. The rules also give additional voting power to minority shareholders if a controlling investor attempts to cancel the company's listing or remove the rights of minority investors. There is also a requirement for greater transparency from the companies. David Lawton, the FCA's director of markets, said: \"By safeguarding minority interests from abuse by controlling shareholders, these changes will promote market integrity and empower minority shareholders to hold the companies they invest in to account.\" Investigations into alleged irregularities at both Kazakh miner ENRC and Indonesia's Bumi raised questions about the wisdom of their original flotations on the London market, given the damage and losses caused to minority investors. ENRC was controlled by its trio of founding shareholders - who are currently in the process of taking it private - while Bumi was part of the Bakrie family's empire. Richard Weaver at PWC said the City would be relieved the regulator decided not to increase the free float, adding: \"Some of the proposed rules, such as the requirement for a formal agreement with the controlling shareholder, may be little more than the codification of existing practice in many cases and hence may not be especially onerous.",

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/howslife.htm\" title=\"\">How's Life? report </a>on wellbeing from the OECD thinktank attempts to count the human cost of the global financial crisis. The wide-ranging report ranks countries on a range of criteria from housing and health to crime and social engagement.</p> <p><strong>Income inequality</strong> was highest in Chile, Mexico and the Russian Federation \u2013 and lowest in Eastern European and Nordic countries. The UK's income inequality was above the OECD average and has risen over the last 15 years.</p> <p><strong>Life satisfaction</strong> is highest in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. People in Hungary, Portugal and Greece report the lowest levels of life satisfaction. In the UK satisfaction rates are higher than before the crisis, with 64% British people declaring being very satisfied with their lives.</p> <p><strong>Life expectancy</strong> is highest in Switzerland followed by Italy, Japan and Spain.</p> <p><strong>Work-life balance</strong> is deemed worst in Turkey, by far and away the country with the highest proportion of employees working very long hours. Mexico and Israel are next and the UK is also ahead of the OECD average. In the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, very long working hours are rare.</p> <p><strong>Leisure time</strong> is highest in Norway and Denmark and lowest in France and Japan.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> is the UK's weakest area when compared with other OECD countries. The UK is only just above average for educational attainment and behind 19 other countries. It is below average for educational expectancy \u2013 the average duration of education a five-year-old can expect to get by the age of 39. Teenage students' average score in reading, mathematics and science in the UK is above average but behind 14 other countries, with Finland and Korea top. Numeracy and literacy levels among adults in the UK are below the OECD averages but ahead of those in the US.</p> <p><strong>Health</strong> was again a stand-out area for Switzerland. In 2011, the percentage of adults reporting good or very good health was 85% or more in Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, but only half as high in Korea and Portugal. Japan ranked last with only one in three respondents reporting being in \"good\" or \"very good\" health.</p> <p><strong>Employment rates</strong> increase with education but some countries do better than others on offering equal job chances. Since 2000 the employment gap between people with tertiary education and people with below upper secondary education has remained stable on average in the OECD area. But it has increased substantially in Slovenia, the UK, Sweden, Iceland and Korea.</p> <p><strong>Homicide rates</strong> are low in most countries and the OECD average is 2.23 homicides per 100,000 people. They are, however, more than twice as high in the United States and even higher in Mexico, Brazil and in the Russian Federation. Iceland, Japan and Norway are the least likely places to get murdered. Over the last 10 years Mexico's homicide rate has almost doubled.</p> <p><strong>Housing conditions</strong> vary greatly between countries. In Canada, Belgium, Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands, households report on average two or more rooms per person.

      "bodyText": "The How's Life? report on wellbeing from the OECD thinktank attempts to count the human cost of the global financial crisis. The wide-ranging report ranks countries on a range of criteria from housing and health to crime and social engagement. Income inequality was highest in Chile, Mexico and the Russian Federation \u2013 and lowest in Eastern European and Nordic countries. The UK's income inequality was above the OECD average and has risen over the last 15 years. Life satisfaction is highest in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. People in Hungary, Portugal and Greece report the lowest levels of life satisfaction. In the UK satisfaction rates are higher than before the crisis, with 64% British people declaring being very satisfied with their lives. Life expectancy is highest in Switzerland followed by Italy, Japan and Spain. Work-life balance is deemed worst in Turkey, by far and away the country with the highest proportion of employees working very long hours. Mexico and Israel are next and the UK is also ahead of the OECD average. In the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, very long working hours are rare. Leisure time is highest in Norway and Denmark and lowest in France and Japan. Education is the UK's weakest area when compared with other OECD countries. The UK is only just above average for educational attainment and behind 19 other countries. It is below average for educational expectancy \u2013 the average duration of education a five-year-old can expect to get by the age of 39. Teenage students' average score in reading, mathematics and science in the UK is above average but behind 14 other countries, with Finland and Korea top. Numeracy and literacy levels among adults in the UK are below the OECD averages but ahead of those in the US. Health was again a stand-out area for Switzerland. In 2011, the percentage of adults reporting good or very good health was 85% or more in Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, but only half as high in Korea and Portugal. Japan ranked last with only one in three respondents reporting being in \"good\" or \"very good\" health. Employment rates increase with education but some countries do better than others on offering equal job chances. Since 2000 the employment gap between people with tertiary education and people with below upper secondary education has remained stable on average in the OECD area. But it has increased substantially in Slovenia, the UK, Sweden, Iceland and Korea. Homicide rates are low in most countries and the OECD average is 2.23 homicides per 100,000 people. They are, however, more than twice as high in the United States and even higher in Mexico, Brazil and in the Russian Federation. Iceland, Japan and Norway are the least likely places to get murdered. Over the last 10 years Mexico's homicide rate has almost doubled. Housing conditions vary greatly between countries. In Canada, Belgium, Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands, households report on average two or more rooms per person. In Turkey, Hungary and Poland, however, people live in smaller houses with one room per person or less. The UK is above average on this. Social support networks appear to be weakest in Turkey, Mexico, Korea and Greece, and strongest in Iceland, Ireland, the UK and Switzerland.",

      "bodyText": "The European commission is warning that it is too early to claim victory in the euro area's fight against recession after its latest forecasts showed it would be 2015 before weak growth generated a fall in the jobless total. Although the 17-nation single currency zone started to expand in the summer after a six-quarter double-dip recession, Brussels said there will be a lag before the pickup in activity leads to a fall in unemployment. The commission trimmed its growth forecast for the euro area in 2014 from 1.2% to 1.1% and said unemployment will remain stuck at a record 12.2% next year. It added that there were encouraging signs that the recovery would continue but said the legacy of Europe's debt crisis would continue to act as a brake on growth. Only in 2015, when growth is expected to increase to 1.7%, does the commission see a dent being made in the jobless total, with unemployment predicted to drop to 11.8%. Olli Rehn, the commission's vice-president for economic and monetary affairs and the euro, said: \"There are increasing signs that the European economy has reached a turning point. The fiscal consolidation and structural reforms undertaken in Europe have created the basis for recovery. \"But it is too early to declare victory: unemployment remains at unacceptably high levels. That's why we must continue working to modernise the European economy, for sustainable growth and job creation.\" The commission, publishing forecasts three times a year for the eurozone and the EU, stresses that the return to solid growth in the countries that belong to the monetary union is set to be gradual, with big differences in economic performance across member states. Financial markets believe the combination of sluggish growth, high unemployment and the threat of deflation will prompt the European Central Bank into fresh efforts to boost activity. Of the bigger euro area countries, only Germany is forecast to grow by more than 1% in 2014. Spain is expected to expand by 0.5%, Italy by 0.7% and France by 0.9%. By contrast, the commission said the outlook for the UK \u2013 which has exceeded expectations in 2013 \u2013 was \"quite bright\". Growth of 2.2% is pencilled in for 2014, rising to 2.4% in 2015.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK has come in ahead of Germany, the United States and Japan as the best place to live and work, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, although inequality has risen faster in Britain than in other countries since the outbreak of the financial crisis. The Paris-based thinktank has measured wellbeing in 34 industrialised nations, weighing up factors including incomes, education, housing and security. It says the UK ranks above the OECD country average on measures such as environmental quality, personal security, jobs and earnings and housing. It is close to average for work-life balance, but below in education and skills. Nonetheless, that performance puts the UK alongside Switzerland, Australia, Nordic European countries, Canada and New Zealand in a clutch of highest-performing countries on the OECD's Better Life Index. The US, Ireland, Germany and France are in the group below, rated as average on the thinktank's \"traffic light\" system for how countries perform on various elements. Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Estonia, Hungary, Greece and Chile are among the countries with a relatively low performance. Overall, the survey paints a picture of substantial pain caused by the financial crisis. \"This report is a wake-up call to us all,\" said the OECD secretary general, Angel Gurr\u00eda. \"It is a reminder that the central purpose of economic policies is to improve people's lives. We need to rethink how to place people's needs at the heart of policy-making.\" The average British household was only modestly affected by the crisis, said the OECD, but many people were blighted by higher unemployment, involuntary part-time work and poverty. \"Life satisfaction and confidence in institutions declined substantially in countries severely hit by the crisis, while people reported soaring stress levels,\" the How's Life 2013 report says. \"However, there was little or no change in health outcomes for the population at large.\" There were other positive spots for the UK, ahead of its European peers. Between 2007 and 2011, household disposable income increased by about 1%; it dropped by 2% in the eurozone. However, income inequality remains a significant counterpoint to the UK's reputation as a fair place to live and work. The OECD said that income inequality increased by more than average in the UK between 2007 and 2011. It indicated that the UK also still had work to do in closing the gender gap: British women are still less likely than men to have a paid job or be elected to parliament and more likely to spend many hours performing household tasks. Its analysis of the financial crisis suggested new forms of solidarity and engagement emerged in the countries that were hardest hit. This trend was less clearcut in the UK, however. The percentage of people reporting having helped someone decreased by 3 percentage points while the share of people reporting having volunteered their time increased by 3 percentage points between 2007 and 2011. The UK also lags behind on education and job prospects. On average, the employment gap between those in OECD countries with tertiary education and those with below upper secondary education had remained stable since 2000. But in the UK, the gap had widened \"substantially\". Some eurozone countries were hit badly by a deterioration of well-being as a result of the financial crisis. Between 2007 and 2012, reported average life satisfaction declined by more than 20% in Greece, 12% in Spain, and 10% in Italy. In the UK, the percentage of British people very satisfied with their lives increased from 63% to 64% over the same period. The thinktank's research into Greece found the average Greek household had been severely affectedby the crisis, particularly when it came to household income, jobs, life satisfaction and civic engagement. From 2007 to 2011, Greece suffered the biggest drop in real household disposable income of all countries while income inequality increased rose by 2%, well above the OECD average of 1.2%. Over the same period, the percentage of Greek people declaring being very satisfied with their lives fell from 59% to 34%, the lowest share in the OECD area. The proportion of very satisfied Americans was 67% in 2011, but that marked a big decline from before the crisis when it was 78%. One of the biggest pressures on Americans was deteriorating labour markets. As budgets became increasingly strained, about 20% of US households moved in with other households, the OECD said. The report underlined the dwindling trust in governments and democracy. In the 34 OECD countries, less than half of those surveyed said they trusted their governments \u2013 the lowest level recorded since 2006. In the UK, however, trust in ruling politicians has increased. According to the OECD, the percentage of British people trusting the government increased from 36% to 47% between 2007 and 2011.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's services sector enjoyed its strongest growth since 1997 as new business flowed in at a record pace last month, according to the latest survey to suggest the recovery is strengthening. The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK services PMI beat City forecasts to jump to a headline activity reading of 62.5 in October, from 60.6 in September. The forecast was for a slight slowdown to 59.8. The index for new work was the highest since records began in 1996 and companies took on new staff at the fastest pace since 1997, according to the survey of a range of businesses in Britain's dominant service sector such as transport, IT and restaurants. The report follows upbeat news in recent days on the smaller construction and manufacturing sectors in sister PMI surveys and is likely to raise expectations that the UK economy can keep up its recent pace of growth. Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit, said the reports suggested growth would accelerate further in the final quarter of this year. \"The UK economic recovery moved up a gear again in October, with the PMIs indicating record growth of output and employment,\" he said. \"Historical comparisons of the PMI against gross domestic product suggest the latest survey data are consistent with a 1.3% quarterly rate of GDP growth, up sharply from previous quarters.\" The latest official data put GDP growth at 0.8% in the third quarter. Some economists have questioned whether that can be matched in the final months of the year, especially given the pressures on consumers from soaring bills and slow pay growth. But Markit suggested that pressures on consumers from the tough labour market were easing with the surveys signalling the private sector is creating more than 100,000 jobs per quarter. Economists said the recent run of mostly upbeat indicators would likely prompt the Bank of England to raise its outlook for growth when it publishes its latest forecasts next week. James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets, said the survey cast doubt over the Bank's outlook for unemployment. Policymakers have said that they will not raise interest rates from their record low at least until the jobless rate falls to 7%, barring various knock-out clauses being triggered. \"Taking all of the PMIs together, the composite reading is suggesting that fourth quarter GDP growth could rise as much as 1.5% - equivalent to around 6% annualised growth,\" said Knightley. \"It is difficult to believe that any other major economy will come close to that in the fourth quarter so sterling is likely to remain strong, particularly against the euro. It will also inevitably lead to further questions over whether the Bank of England seriously believes that it will be three years before the unemployment rate falls to 7%. We still think interest rates could rise in early 2015.\" But Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, questioned how much markets and policymakers should read into Tuesday's report. \"The survey feels a bit frothy,\" he said. \"No doubt conditions are robust, improving and better than thought at the start of the year. But I am a little wary that the hard data lives up to what the surveys suggest they should be doing.\" Experts have also questioned the sustainability of the UK's recovery, arguing the government's much espoused rebalancing towards manufacturing and exports is a long way off. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said on Tuesday that while it expects growth to pick up from 1.4% this year to 2% in 2014, the economy will remain over-dependent on squeezed consumers.",

      "body": "<p><strong>RSA Insurance</strong> has seen its forecasts blown away by the recent severe weather, leaving its shares floundering.</p> <p>In an earlier than expected third quarter update, the insurer said the windstorm across the UK and northern Europe would cost the company \u00a345m to \u00a365m, with the majority of this coming in Scandanavia. Floods in Canada have added to the problems, meaning weather losses in 2013 would be \"materially above planning assumptions\" and return on equity would be below 10%. Chief executive Simon Lee said:</p> <blockquote> Assuming no further major weather events in 2013, we now expect the impact of adverse weather across the group to be around 1.5% above our assumption. <br> </blockquote> <p>The news has sent RSA shares 7.2p or 5.5% lower to 121.9p, making it the biggest faller in a downbeat FTSE 100. Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes repeated his sell recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote> RSA has brought forward its third quarter management statement to today as a result of the European windstorm losses that are expected to cost around \u00a345-65m. The result of this is likely to result in a 1.5% deterioration on the Combined Operating Ratio which is now expected to be worse than the previous \"95% or better\" stated target. The 2013 expected return on equity is now expected to be below 10%. <br> We have assumed that the impact will be a \u00a355m hit to operating profit in 2013 resulting in us cutting our 2013 forecast earnings per share by 9% to 10.7p per share. We maintain our sell recommendation and 117p target price believing that the current valuation is too great. Whilst one cannot rule out a bid approach [from one of its European competitors] in our view the press rumoured 190p per share bid speculation is pure puff.  RSA being a bid target is an old chestnut but 190p per share? In our view there is more chance of Gareth Bale returning to Tottenham in January than there is of a bid of that size. </blockquote> <p>Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said the update was disappointing and said that a review of its bodily injury reserves in Ireland was \"rarely a good thing.\" He added:</p> <blockquote> The shares have performed well in recent weeks but we expect weakness this morning. We would view such weakness as a buying opportunity, highlighting the 30% premium to net asset value and the around 4.8% forward yield. <br> </blockquote> <p>Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> RSA released its [update] early in light of adverse weather losses. The announcement was due on Thursday 7 November. <br> Claims from the recent UK and European storms are estimated to \u00a345-65m. The majority of these losses were in Scandinavia. We note Willis recently estimated industry losses of $1.1bn-1.8bn.

      "bodyText": "RSA Insurance has seen its forecasts blown away by the recent severe weather, leaving its shares floundering. In an earlier than expected third quarter update, the insurer said the windstorm across the UK and northern Europe would cost the company \u00a345m to \u00a365m, with the majority of this coming in Scandanavia. Floods in Canada have added to the problems, meaning weather losses in 2013 would be \"materially above planning assumptions\" and return on equity would be below 10%. Chief executive Simon Lee said: Assuming no further major weather events in 2013, we now expect the impact of adverse weather across the group to be around 1.5% above our assumption. The news has sent RSA shares 7.2p or 5.5% lower to 121.9p, making it the biggest faller in a downbeat FTSE 100. Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes repeated his sell recommendation, saying: RSA has brought forward its third quarter management statement to today as a result of the European windstorm losses that are expected to cost around \u00a345-65m. The result of this is likely to result in a 1.5% deterioration on the Combined Operating Ratio which is now expected to be worse than the previous \"95% or better\" stated target. The 2013 expected return on equity is now expected to be below 10%. We have assumed that the impact will be a \u00a355m hit to operating profit in 2013 resulting in us cutting our 2013 forecast earnings per share by 9% to 10.7p per share. We maintain our sell recommendation and 117p target price believing that the current valuation is too great. Whilst one cannot rule out a bid approach [from one of its European competitors] in our view the press rumoured 190p per share bid speculation is pure puff. RSA being a bid target is an old chestnut but 190p per share? In our view there is more chance of Gareth Bale returning to Tottenham in January than there is of a bid of that size. Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said the update was disappointing and said that a review of its bodily injury reserves in Ireland was \"rarely a good thing.\" He added: The shares have performed well in recent weeks but we expect weakness this morning. We would view such weakness as a buying opportunity, highlighting the 30% premium to net asset value and the around 4.8% forward yield. Oriel Securities said: RSA released its [update] early in light of adverse weather losses. The announcement was due on Thursday 7 November. Claims from the recent UK and European storms are estimated to \u00a345-65m. The majority of these losses were in Scandinavia. We note Willis recently estimated industry losses of $1.1bn-1.8bn. The group has incurred further losses from previously announced July floods in Toronto estimated to be \u00a337m, further adverse weather conditions in Canada and an uptick in bodily injury claims in Irish motor. Whilst weather conditions have been tough, today's announcement will disappoint the market. The company's longer term strategy of refocusing the UK business and building up its international exposure in Canada and emerging markets, where growth prospects and margins should be higher, may see the shares react positively in the longer term. But the shares look up with events and we struggle to see any near term catalysts to drive a re-rating. Hold. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 25.50 points at 6738.12, with the fall accelerating after a stronger than expected UK service sector PMI survey, raising the prospect of an earlier than expected end to QE or even an interest rate rise. On a busy day for company results - scheduled or otherwise - Marks &amp; Spencer has added 15.9p to 503p despite a ninth consecutive quarterly fall in general merchandise, including clothing. But the update was much as expected, so the share reaction has so far been positive. Primark owner Associated British Foods fell 69p to \u00a321.86 despite reporting higher full year profits, as investors took profits and analysts pointed to a cautious outlook for the coming year. Elsewhere Imperial Tobacco added 68p to \u00a323.78 as full year operating profits rose 29% to \u00a31.95bn despite a dip in revenues. The company also announced a 10% hike in the full year dividend, and said chairman Ian Napier would step down in February.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has revealed a 9.1% fall in half-year profits as underlying sales of clothing and homewares slipped back for the ninth consecutive quarter. The 1.3% drop in underlying general merchandise sales \u2013 mainly clothing \u2013 in the six months to September looked particularly poor when set against a roaring performance from the fast-fashion chain Primark, which revealed a 3-4% uplift in underlying sales for the same period. Primark is now snapping at M&amp;S's heels with an expected \u00a35bn in clothing sales in 2014: close to, if not above, the projected clothing turnover for its older rival this year. A 1% fall in margins on sales of general merchandise at M&amp;S, as well as higher costs because of investment in overseas stores, new IT systems and distribution centres counteracted a strong performance from M&amp;S's food business and online store. While total sales rose to \u00a34.9bn in the first half, up 4% on the same period a year before, pre-tax profit fell to \u00a3261.6m from \u00a3287.3m on an underlying basis.Meanwhile, profits from international stores also fell back as M&amp;S spent nearly \u00a325m on the closure of four stores in Ireland, where trading has been poor, and invested a similar amount in opening two new stores in France. But shares in the retailer rose 4.5% to 509p, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, as investors clung on to slight signs of improvement, led by promising early signs for M&amp;S's all-important autumn/winter clothing collection. Chief executive Marc Bolland promised that M&amp;S would meet profit expectations for the year and that the company was \"well set up for the key Christmas trading period with more innovation and choice than ever before.\" The Dutchman insisted that M&amp;S's latest clothing ranges, produced under a new team led by head of general merchandise John Dixon and former Debenhams boss Belinda Earl, had sold more items at full price. Bolland said 80% of the product items from its leading ladies' range had sold out within 6 weeks. He blamed the fall in clothing and homewares profit margins on moving the autumn sale period into the first half of the financial year and the need for heavier discounting in a tough market. Bolland added, however, that recent figures indicated that M&amp;S had stopped losing market share. Bolland admitted that sales might have been better if M&amp;S had stocked more of its most sought after fashions, such as a pink coat, which sold out quickly. He said M&amp;S had bought 40% more of the 72 general merchandise items featured in its Christmas ad campaign to stop the problem recurring but he refused to say when underlying general merchandise sales might return to growth. He said: \"What we've seen is a gradual improvement and what we are looking for is a gradual improvement, step by step.\" He said consumer confidence was improving, but there was little evidence, as yet, of this translating to increased spending in the retail sector so he was cautious about trading in the run up to ChristmasHe added: \"Most important is that we are choosing the right direction and that is quality and style,\" he said. Shareholders said Bolland had a lot of ground to make up in the second half of the financial year and still had some work to do to prove that general merchandise sales performance had turned around. But they backed his strategy and were optimistic that M&amp;S would see an uplift in clothing sales this Christmas. Richard Black at Legal &amp; General said: \"There are signs that things are getting better. Some people thought the company might miss its profit forecasts but the company has done what it promised. It appears they are no longer losing market share and if general merchandise were to turn a corner it would lead to a big switch in sentiment on the stock.\" Richard Marwood, a fund manager at AXA Investment Management, said that shareholders were giving Bolland \"the benefit of the doubt\" on clothing perfomance. \"We are watching with interest. Six months ago Bolland was definitely under a lot of pressure. The better view of the new clothing collection has given him breathing space. We were never going to see financial evidence of that improvement today but people will be looking more keenly in January for more positive signs,\" he said. The new ranges, which were only in place for a few weeks of the last trading period, will get their real test in the critical Christmas quarter. Bolland's new store layout, with specific areas for coats, dresses and casual clothing, will be in all stores by March.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Construction and retailing offer contrasting perspectives on Britain's economic recovery. On the UK's building sites, things are looking up . The monthly construction industry health check from CIPS/Markit showed jobs growth and output rising at their fastest for six years. Although that may be more a reflection of the deep hole the sector plunged into during the recession, sentiment has certainly improved. The Government's Help to Buy scheme has boosted house building, but Monday's report suggests demand for commercial property is also on the up. Tuesday's report from the British Retailers Consortium is more mixed. After a strong summer, spending growth in the high street has cooled in the last couple of months. That could be because sales of new winter fashions have been hit by unseasonally warm weather, or it could be that consumers are saving up for a big splurge at Christmas. It could be that individuals are finding it hard to make the sums add up during a prolonged period when prices have been rising more quickly than wages. In all probability, the cautious mood is a combination of all three. Rising consumer spending is the reason economic activity picked up in the second and third quarters of the year. There was little boost from the other components of growth -\u2013 investment, exports and the state \u2013 so the expansion was the result of higher household spending. How is this possible when real earnings are falling? In part, spending has been encouraged by rising employment. In part, it has been aided by stronger consumer confidence, which has led to people running down the precautionary savings they built up when they were more pessimistic about the future. Clearly, consumers will be unable to continue dipping into their savings to fund their spending for ever. That's why forecasting groups such as the National Institute for Economic Research have only modest expectations for growth in 2014: a 2% increase in GDP following 1.4% in 2013. NIESR sees little prospect of stronger investment kicking in, and with the prospects for exporters decidedly mixed that means consumers will again bear the strain. Even so, the NIESR forecast looks too low. There will be some recovery in investment in response to stronger consumer spending. More significantly, perhaps, the housing market now has real momentum and that will lead to some further drop in the savings ratio to compensate for squeezed incomes.",

      "body": "<p>Construction and retailing offer contrasting perspectives on Britain's economic recovery. On the UK's building sites, things are looking up . The monthly construction industry health check from CIPS/Markit showed jobs growth and output rising at their fastest for six years. Although that may be more a reflection of the deep hole the sector plunged into during the recession, sentiment has certainly improved. The Government's Help to Buy scheme has boosted house building, but Monday's report suggests demand for commercial property is also on the up.</p> <p>Tuesday's report from the British Retailers Consortium is more mixed. After a strong summer, spending growth in the high street has cooled in the last couple of months. That could be because sales of new winter fashions have been hit by unseasonally warm weather, or it could be that consumers are saving up for a big splurge at Christmas. It could be that individuals are finding it hard to make the sums add up during a prolonged period when prices have been rising more quickly than wages. In all probability, the cautious mood is a combination of all three.</p> <p>Rising consumer spending is the reason economic activity picked up in the second and third quarters of the year. There was little boost from the other components of growth -\u2013 investment, exports and the state \u2013 so the expansion was the result of higher household spending. How is this possible when real earnings are falling? In part, spending has been encouraged by rising employment. In part, it has been aided by stronger consumer confidence, which has led to people running down the precautionary savings they built up when they were more pessimistic about the future.</p> <p>Clearly, consumers will be unable to continue dipping into their savings to fund their spending for ever. That's why forecasting groups such as the National Institute for Economic Research have only modest expectations for growth in 2014: a 2% increase in GDP following 1.4% in 2013. NIESR sees little prospect of stronger investment kicking in, and with the prospects for exporters decidedly mixed that means consumers will again bear the strain.</p> <p>Even so, the NIESR forecast looks too low. There will be some recovery in investment in response to stronger consumer spending. More significantly, perhaps, the housing market now has real momentum and that will lead to some further drop in the savings ratio to compensate for squeezed incomes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "UK growth will pick up next year but the economy will remain over-dependent on squeezed consumers, a leading thinktank has warned. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) forecasts growth will come in at 1.4% this year and quicken to 2% next year. Both those forecasts are up by 0.2 percentage points since NIESR's last outlook was published in August. The group attributed the upgrade to a better out-turn for the economy at the start of this year and in the third quarter, when official data put growth at a quarterly 0.8%. The thinktank's 2% growth forecast for next year is ahead of 1.9% from the International Monetary Fund and 1.8% predicted in March by the the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury's independent forecaster. But NIESR argued growth was not built on solid foundations. \"After two years of stagnation, economic growth has returned, underpinned by an increase in consumer spending,\" the thinktank said. \"Consumer spending growth is necessary for an economic recovery in the UK, but a consumer-driven recovery will not be 'balanced', let alone one reflecting the required long-term 'rebalancing' towards an economy with greater net national saving.\" While the Treasury is likely to welcome a forecast of accelerating growth, the report comes as a blow to chancellor George Osborne's push for the economy to wean itself off dependency on consumer spending. NIESR predicts the UK will have to wait until 2016 to see a positive contribution to growth from net trade. NIESR's view is that consumers will drive growth by running down their savings as they continue to suffer from falling real wages. Because pay growth has failed to keep pace with living costs, households have been left with dwindling disposable incomes. Simon Kirby, author of NIESR's UK outlook, expects more of the same next year. Real wages will not start growing again until 2015, he said. Even then, growth will be \"gradual\" and wages will only be rising when taken as an average across earners, meaning many will wait even longer to see their real pay grow again. \"It's going to take a number of years for real consumer wages to just get back to levels seen before 2008,\" he said. NIESR predicts real wages will only be back to their pre-recession peak in 2019 \u2013 a year after per capita GDP recovers its pre-crisis peak. It expects unemployment to fall only slowly from 7.7% now to 7.4% by the middle of next year. The Bank of England has said under its forward guidance scheme that it will not consider raising interest rates until unemployment drops to at least 7% \u2013 unless one of various knock-out clauses are triggered, such as an excessive outlook for inflation. NIESR does not see 7% being reached until 2016 but it believes the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) will raise rates in the second half of 2015, possibly using the financial stability knockout as justification. \"There has been little notice taken of the MPC's forward guidance to date \u2026 To some extent we are ignoring forward guidance as well,\" said Kirby. Those in financial markets that bet that the Bank will raise rates sooner than it has signalled took further support from a stronger-than-expected report on the construction sector. Robust business for housebuilders against the backdrop of rising housing market activity helped the overall construction sector enjoy its strongest growth for six years, according to the Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI survey. Civil engineering and commercial projects also enjoyed a boost in October helping the report's output measure rise to 59.4 from 58.9 in September, above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for the sixth straight month. It was the highest reading since September 2007 and beat the forecast of 58.9 in a Reuters poll of economists. A bright UK economic outlook helped boost output and client spending, construction companies said in the survey. They took on workers at the fastest pace for six years as a majority expected output to continue rising over the year ahead. The retail industry had a more challenging October, according to the latest British Retail Consortium report. Its monthly sales monitor with consultants KPMG said volumes were up 0.8% on a like-for-like basis from October 2012 as unseasonably warm weather saw clothing sales fall but gadgets, games and home accessories all enjoyed growth. That compared with an annual fall of 0.1% in October 2012. On a less volatile rolling three-month basis, sales growth slowed to 1.0% in August to October, the weakest pace since the start of the summer. David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG said: \"October was another difficult month for retailers reminding us that recovery is a slow, relentless slog. Whilst the summer months hinted at increased consumer confidence, retailers will struggle to maintain a sustained sales recovery until wage growth outpaces price inflation. While confidence may lead consumers to browse, it's cash that's needed in the tills.\"",
