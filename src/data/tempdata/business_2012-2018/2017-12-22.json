      "bodyText": "The retirement plans of tens of thousands of steel workers have been thrown into disarray after their pensions were pushed into the Pension Protection Fund, the government lifeboat for failed schemes. The 122,000 members of the British Steel pension scheme (BSPS) have until Friday to decide whether to stay with the scheme, join a new one with reduced benefits set up by Tata Steel, or transfer to a personal plan. Tata was forced to offload the \u00a315bn BSPS, to pave the way for a 50-50 merger of its European operations with Germany\u2019s ThyssenKrupp to create the second biggest steel producer in Europe after ArcelorMittal. It is thought more than 20,000 members had still not indicated a decision to leave by the deadline. As a result, they will default into the PPF \u2013 a move that is likely to see their retirement savings dramatically slashed. The PPF steps in to save schemes when they face collapse, meaning savers do not lose everything. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon where Tata\u2019s Port Talbot steelworks is situated, said: \u201cIt\u2019s deeply worrying that we have a huge number that have not responded. \u201cWhy was the PPF the default? Why on earth wasn\u2019t BSPS 2 the default? I have written to [the work and pensions secretary] David Gauke a few weeks ago about this and he still hasn\u2019t responded. It is still possible for the government to step in and sort this out.\u201d Allan Johnston, the chairman of the BSPS trustees, said the situation was a concern, because for around 99% of pensioners the new scheme, set up by Tata, still represents the best option. Alan Rubenstein, the chief executive of the PPF, disagreed, saying \u201cmost, but not all, BSPS pensioners would be financially no worse off or marginally better off in the new scheme\u201d. The BSPS said the deadline could not be extended because it would cost the pension scheme an additional \u00a3200m if the transfers were not completed by the end of January. Scheme trustees, union leaders and the Financial Conduct Authority, the country\u2019s main financial regulator, have all faced criticism for not providing sufficient advice and protection to members. BSPS trustees have held 40 events at 11 locations over the last five weeks in an attempt to reach out to members with advice on what to do with their pension pots, many worth as much as \u00a3300,000. The 4,500-strong British Steel Pension Members Group made a plea to staff in retirement and care homes in North Lincolnshire, close to British Steel\u2019s former Scunthorpe works, to see if residents were aware of the deadline. The pension transfer process descended into chaos as unscrupulous financial advisers, charging large fees, flooded into the steel heartlands of south Wales and the north of England in a bid to persuade workers to transfer their retirement pots. Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, said the practice had become a \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d and a \u201choney pot for scammers\u201d. \u201cTransferring out of a gold-plated final salary pension is generally a terrible idea, except in very particular circumstances,\u201d he said. The regulator is investigating 17 such firms, but MPs said the efforts to protect steelworkers was inadequate, and that the FCA should have acted sooner. \u201cThe FCA has been asleep at the wheel,\u201d Kinnock said. The aim of the joint venture with ThyssenKrupp is to create a leading European provider of flat steel, and position it as a leader in quality and technology. The new company will have annual sales of roughly \u20ac15bn and employ around 48,000 people. A source close to Tata said: \u201cThe pension is not an issue. It is a done deal. But ThyssenKrupp has got its own problems in Germany with the unions.\u201d Workers at ThyssenKrupp initially opposed the deal, fuelled by concern that more steel jobs would be lost on top of the 2,000 already announced. IG Metall, the powerful German union, demanded 10-year guarantees for jobs, plants and investments. A deal was struck on Friday between the union and management removing the final obstacle to the planned merger.",

I\u2019lll be back next week, for the final sprint to the new year. We hope you have a lovely Christmas. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The bitcoin selloff is gathering pace. It\u2019s now down around $3,000 today at $12,900 -- a bitter blow to anyone who bought at almost $20,000 this week. The selloff comes as Warren Buffett\u2019s top lieutenant, Charlie Munger, adds his voice to the chorus of warnings against digital currencies. CNBC has the details: Munger, 93, was asked for his views on cryptocurrencies during a University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business event. \u201cI think it is perfectly asinine to even pause to think about them,\u201d Munger said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad people, crazy bubble, bad idea, luring people into the concept of easy wealth without much insight or work. That\u2019s the last thing on earth you should think about \u2026 There\u2019s just a whole lot of things that aren\u2019t going to work for you. Figure out what they are and avoid them like the plague. And one of them is bitcoin. \u2026 It is total insanity.\u201d The interview was published Wednesday on the business school\u2019s YouTube channel. It is not clear when exactly the event was held, but the video has largely gone unnoticed with roughly 7,000 views as of Friday morning. Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades, says the bitcoin price action resembles Las Vegas: After a record high on Sunday where bitcoin fell just short of $20,000, it has now fallen by $3000 in just a few hours and today it\u2019s roughly valued at $13,500. It\u2019s the type of volatility we are getting used to seeing from the Cryptocurrency and it wouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, if it was to recover even by the end of the day The people selling the coin believe they are getting a good deal, and then those buying it believe they are getting it at a good price. It\u2019s continuing to fuel the unpredictability of the market and more and more people are getting involved. It\u2019s like red or black in the casino. Here\u2019s our economics editor, Larry Elliott, on today\u2019s UK GDP figures: Spending by UK households slowed to its lowest level in almost six years during 2017 as the impact of higher inflation hit living standards. The Office for National Statistics said spending in the third quarter was up by 1% on the same period in 2016 \u2013 the weakest annual growth since the first three months of 2012. In its latest update on the state of the economy, the ONS reported growth of 0.4% in the third quarter \u2013 unchanged on its previous estimates but slightly higher than the 0.3% recorded in each of the first two quarters. Revisions to previous data meant, however, that annual growth in the year to the third quarter has been adjusted up from 1.5% to 1.7%. Household spending increased 0.5% between the second and third quarters but was boosted by consumers running down their savings during a period when real incomes were squeezed by price rises running ahead of pay. Paul Hollingsworth, a UK analyst at Capital Economics, said the ONS figures revealed a more balanced growth picture, with household spending revised down but business investment revised up from 0.2% to 0.5%. \u201cThe economy looks to have maintained this pace in Q4,\u201d Hollingsworth added. \u201cThis should mean that GDP growth for 2017 as a whole should come in at about 1.8%.\u201d... Santa isn\u2019t paying an early visit to Europe\u2019s stock markets today. All the major European bourses are as red as Rudolph\u2019s nose, with Spain leading the fallers as pro-independence parties celebrate the Catalan election. But the Spanish IBEX is still only down around 1.2% - so hardly a crash. Despite today\u2019s selloff, the German, French and Italian stock markets are up over 10% this year, and Spain isn\u2019t far behind (up 8.9%). Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Catalonian regional elections may have delivered another awkward pro-independence message for PM Rajoy in Madrid, but as has been the case for the last year, if not longer, investors are happy to keep looking past geopolitical risk. Think of all we\u2019ve seen and heard. And look at where we are. A roller coaster it may have been, but we\u2019re thicker skinned for it and nursing handsome gains. Might 2018 deliver more of the same? Hopes that Britain\u2019s stock market might hit a new record high in the final session before Christmas have been dashed. The FTSE 100 has just closed down 11 points, or -0.15%, at 7592, in a rather quiet trading session. Next, the retailer, was the top risers -- suggesting traders think it may be enjoying a good festive season. David Madden of CMC Markets says that consumer stocks were in \u201chigh demand\u201d, despite this morning\u2019s concerns that households are going deeper into debt..... Bitcoin investors may be feeling blue today. The cryptocurrency has suffered a heavy selloff, shedding up to $2,000 to around $13,400 in a bout of volatile trading. This means bitcoin has lost a quarter of its value since the start of the week, amid growing signs that regulators and governments might be cracking down on digital currencies. So why the sudden selloff? Kerim Derhalli, founder and CEO of finance app Invstr, has a theory: \u201cBitcoin\u2019s meteoric price rise is mostly due to the highly illiquid nature of the current market. There are very few Bitcoin available to buy on the open, which pushes prices up. \u201cBut with illiquidity comes volatility. Even small changes to the market, in terms of either supply of Bitcoin or investor confidence, can have a big effect in prices. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet what happened here, but it is possible that someone with a large stockpile of Bitcoin made it available to the market. This increase in availability could have initially driven prices down, with other holders \u2013 especially those that bought at the top of the market \u2013 panicked into offloading as a result. Anyone who bought bitcoin at the start of 2017, for around $1,000, is still sitting on gains, of course (as long as they haven\u2019t lost the password for their bitcoin wallet). Pensions Partners\u2019 Charlie Bilello points out that bitcoin has now suffered five slumps this year. The previous four were shaken off quite quickly..... The Greek government says it will not drop its crackdown against homeowners who can\u2019t repay their debts, despite last night\u2019s explosion in Athens. Addressing parliament today the national economy ministry Dimitiris Papadimitriou said the leftist-led government was determined to tackle strategic defaulters who had deliberately elected not to pay \u201clarge loans to build villas\u201d but he insisted that no primary home was at risk of being seized. Papadimitriou says: \u201cThe government has pledged to protect primary homes and will continue to do so. \u201cNo heavily indebted household is at risk. Those who are in danger are the debtors who took out large loans to build villas.\u201d A new law would be passed tackling defaulters in the next three months, he told the House. With just 10 minutes of the trading day to go, the FTSE 100 has dropped back from its earlier record high. The index is now down 1 point at 7602.... Getting back to today\u2019s UK GDP report... here\u2019s Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG: \u201cThe final figures for the third quarter paint a picture of a significantly weaker domestic economy but a more positive exports performance. Weaker government spending and a marginal downward revision to consumer spending were offset by an upward revision to investment and a rise in exports, as companies took advantage of the weak pound and bourgeoning growth momentum in many of the UK\u2019s key trading partners. The UK\u2019s current account position improved as a result. \u201cConsumer spending was a key driver of growth in the third quarter, however the rise in spending centred on households\u2019 basic needs such as electricity, gas and fuel, as well as housing rent and transport. Spending on discretionary treats like restaurants and hotels actually declined, as a squeeze on real incomes made consumers more careful with their spending. \u201cWith consumer spending remaining under pressure next year, exporters will need to play a significant role in propelling UK economic growth, despite uncertainty over the UK\u2019s trading relationships once it leaves from the EU.\u201c The company that makes Fox\u2019s Glacier Mints has been bought by the maker of Jacob\u2019s biscuits in a \u20ac100m (\u00a389m). Ireland\u2019s Valeo Foods Group, which is already home to Rowse honey and Balconi Italian cakes, on Friday signed a deal to buy the British and Czech confectionary operations of Finland\u2019s Raisio. Included in the deal are the brands Fox\u2019s, Poppets and Pedro. Seamus Kearney, chief executive of Valeo, says: \u201cWe are very excited about the opportunities to expand and grow the acquired businesses through a combination of significant new capital and brand investment.\u201d Meanwhile, there has been major bomb blast outside Greece\u2019s appeals court just days after parliament passed tough measures penalising anti-bailout protestors who regularly gather at court hearings. Police are reporting extensive damage but no injuries. Helena Smith reports from Athens The powerful explosive device, which ripped through the court complex just meters away from Greece\u2019s police headquarters, is being linked to mounting anger over the contentious issue of property auctions. Courts are often the scene of violent protests when auctions of properties occur, with enraged owners attacking clerks and public notaries assigned to push them through. This week the leftist-led government passed legislation penalising protestors who resorted to \u201ccriminal acts\u201d of violence.\u201d \u201cIt is a miracle that no one was hurt,\u201d said a police spokesman adding that guards had been alerted to the bomb after a local leftwing newspaper received a warning call shortly before the explosion at 3 AM. Foreclosures have been demanded by Greece\u2019s bailout creditors as part of efforts to deal with the country\u2019s record stock of non-performing loans - which is the worst in the EU, at around 50% of debt. Much of the bad debt has been attributed to strategic defaulters. The explosion is not only embarrassing for authorities but will put huge pressure on the government now perceived to have reneged on earlier promises to protect the thousands of Greeks who hit by austerity are unable to honour mortgage payments. The rise in household borrowing will fuel concerns that some UK families are dangerously in debt. City fund manager Toby Nangle yesterday tweeted this chart, showing where the debt burden is falling: He\u2019s also written two interesting blog posts, showing that the key issue for policymakers is how this debt is concentrated. He imagines two fictional countries - Feudaland, where most households owe a small amount of debt to a few creditors, and Debtzania, where most households are creditors but a few are deeply in debt. In Feudaland, there is much less risk to financial stability - even though most people are borrowers. As Toby puts it: Feudaland\u2019s wealth inequality might eventually prove politically unsustainable, but it would be hard to call it financially unsustainable, even in an environment where interest rates doubled. Despite exactly the same aggregate debt-metrics, Debtzania looks much more financially fragile than Feudaland. More here: Reverse ferret on household debt and here: Household Debt in the UK Although the upward revision to UK growth is obviously welcome, it\u2019s being overshadowed by the news that Britain\u2019s households have fallen deeper into debt. Nicholas Megaw of the FT explains why it\u2019s a worry: Consumer spending has held up better than many economists had expected since last year\u2019s Brexit vote, despite rising inflation and sluggish wage growth weighing on real incomes. But Friday\u2019s data provide further evidence that consumers are increasingly taking on debt to maintain their consumption levels. Net borrowing by households increased 75 per cent quarter on quarter to \u00a32.8bn. The figures marked the first time households have been net borrowers for four successive quarters since records began in 1987. Bloomberg\u2019s Andrew Atkinson is also concerned by the squeeze on UK consumers, saying: The news on growth highlights the twin pressures facing the U.K., both of them relating to Brexit. Disposable incomes rose just 0.2 percent from a year earlier after adjusting for inflation, which has been driven higher by the fall in sterling since the vote to leave the EU. Consumer spending climbed 1 percent, the least in 5 1/2 years. The ONS also said that households have paid out more money than they received for four consecutive quarters, the first time that\u2019s happened since records began in 1987. Companies, meanwhile, remain reluctant to spend until there is greater clarity about life outside the EU. Business investment increased an annual 1.7 percent, the worst reading for more than a year. Despite it being nearly Christmas, some City experts are still on duty and reacting to this morning\u2019s updated UK GDP report. Capital Economics say Britain is on track to beat growth forecasts this year: Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, agrees that the UK has done better than feared in 2017: \u201cThe UK\u2019s performance has been rather better than the gloomy talk would suggest. Growth has come in stronger than expected a year ago and the pace of activity has edged up since July. \u201cA year ago the near-universal view was that unemployment would rise in 2017; instead it has fallen by 150,000 and the jobless rate is at a 42 year low. \u201cA whopping sterling devaluation certainly has squeezed spending power and incomes, just as you\u2019d expect, but it\u2019s also helped reboot manufacturing output. \u201cOverall, growth has slowed modestly, not collapsed. Talk of an end to UK growth has been somewhat exaggerated.\u201d Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u2019s principal economist, awards the report three Christmas tree emojis: But Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says Britain is still in the \u2018middle lane\u2019, with households squeezed by \u201chigher inflation and muted earnings growth. Furthermore, employment dipped in the third quarter. Consequently, real household disposable income rose by just 0.2% in the third quarter while the household savings ratio dipped to 5.2% in the third quarter from 5.6% in the second quarter. Jamie McGeever of Reuters isn\u2019t impressed by the upward revision to UK growth: Today\u2019s GDP report also shows that UK households are suffering from the impact of rising inflation. Household spending growth slowed to just 1.0% over the last year, the weakest pace in five years, and down from a previous estimate of +1.6%. And despite that slowdown, families were forced to dip into their savings and run up more debt, to cover the fact that wages aren\u2019t keeping pace with inflation. The Office for National Statistics says: Real household disposable income quarter on previous quarter growth was 0.2% in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2017 as a result of an increase in wages and salaries, partially offset by the rise in prices experienced by households. Real household disposable income growth in 2016 has been revised down to flat from 0.1%, as previously published. The saving ratio fell to 5.2% in Quarter 3 2017, due mainly to the growth in households\u2019 spending exceeding the growth in households\u2019 income. In the non-financial account, the net borrowing position of households increased in the latest quarter. Households have now been net borrowers for four successive quarters for the first time since records began in 1987. Today\u2019s GDP report confirms that Britain\u2019s economy has now expanded for 19 quarters in a row: Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector enjoyed the strongest growth over the last quarter, but the construction sector shrank: agriculture increased by 0.8% production increased by 1.3% construction decreased by 0.5% services increased by 0.4% Newsflash: Britain\u2019s economy has grown faster than expected over the last 12 months. The Office for National Statistics has revised up its estimate for year-on-year growth in the last quarter, to 1.7% from 1.5%. That\u2019s because the ONS now thinks the UK economy grew faster than previously thought in the six months after the Brexit vote. Business investment was stronger than first thought. It rose by 1.7% over the last 12 months, the ONS says, up from a previous estimate of 1.3% Head of National Accounts Darren Morgan says that Most of the growth came from the dominant service sector, with accounting, recruitment agencies and retailing all performing well. \u201cManufacturing also boosted growth thanks to an increase in exports and the introduction of new car models. Meanwhile, household spending and business investment both grew steadily. On a quarterly basis, UK GDP rose by 0.4% - unchanged on the previous estimate. That\u2019s slower than France, whose quarterly growth was revised up to 0.6% this morning, and Germany which expanded by a robust 0.8% in July to September. More to follow.... Spanish bond prices have hit a one-month low, as the renewed political uncertainty worries traders. This pushed the yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Spanish bonds to 1.5% - the highest level since November (yields rise when prices fall). The euro has also slipped following the Catalan election results; it\u2019s currently down 0.2% at $1.185. Jane Foley of Rabobank says financial markets had hoped that the regional election would take Catalan independence off the agenda. Clearly that\u2019s not happened, so traders are rethinking about the whole issue. As Foley puts it: The markets have to reevaluate what it means for Spain, and does it mean anything for other countries - such as the Italian election in the spring. She believes that Spain\u2019s strong growth will help to \u2018paper over the cracks\u2019 in its political system. But the Catalonia independence movement is just part of a wider issue, of nationalism and regionalism, that will continue to affect Europe in the next few years. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has shaken off worries about Catalonia, and hit a new all-time high. The blue-chip index has climbed to 7,611 points, around 5 points above last night\u2019s record close. Perhaps yesterday\u2019s \u2018Santa Rally\u2019 hasn\u2019t quite run out of steam yet. The Catalan crisis is likely to worry credit rating agencies, says Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale: Pro-independence parties got enough votes to win a slim majority in yesterday\u2019s elections, a result that is more an embarrassment for PM Rajoy than a victory for the separatists, given the small majority. Still, it lowers the chance of a rating upgrade any time soon in Spain. This chart shows how the three pro-independence parties claimed 70 of the 135 seats on offer in the Catalan election. Former first minister Carles Puigdemont\u2019 s Together for Catalonia (JxCAT) party won 34 seats - two more than rival independence party the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC). But it\u2019s not clear whether Puigdemont could be reappointed as first minister, as he faces arrest if he returns from Belgium - where he fled last month. Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence says the process of electing a new first minister will be \u201cfar from straightforward\u201d. He adds that Spanish politics looks a lot less certain: The biggest loser of Election Night was the People\u2019s Party (PP) of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which obtained only 3 seats, with Ciudadanos stealing a substantial number of voters away from Spain\u2019s ruling party. More crucially, Ciudadanos\u2019 victory in Catalonia will likely give the party of Albert Rivera additional momentum in opinion polls on the national level. This means that Rajoy \u2013 whose PP does not have a majority in the Spanish parliament \u2013 has a strong incentive to avoid an early general election. However, whether he is able to do so will depend on the negotiations on a new budget with other parties that will take place early next year, which the Catalan situation will continue to complicate. In sum, 2018 will likely be the year in which it will become clearer whether or not Rajoy can survive for a full term. Spanish banks are leading the fallers. Banco de Sabadell and CaixaBank - the two biggest banks in Catalonia - have both shed at least 3%. Spain\u2019s IBEX index had plunged by 140 points, in early trading to 10,164 points. That\u2019s a decline of almost 1.4%. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says the Catalan election results have triggered an early selloff: The calling of regional elections in Catalonia, Spain, appears to have backfired for the Spanish Government as the pro-independence parties won enough seats to form a regional coalition government. The three pro-independence parties won 70 of the 135 seats, crucially ahead of the 68 needed. However, it remains to be seen whether these three parties are able to create a government between them. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the of the word economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the final trading day before Christmas. Traditionally, a calm time in the City as traders count this year\u2019s winnings (or losses) and head to the pubs after trading ends at lunchtime. But not this year. Instead, European markets have been rattled by the news that Catalonia\u2019s pro-independence parties have retained their majority in the snap election held yesterday. Separatist parties won 70 of the 135 seats in the Barcelona parliament (even though the centre-right, pro-unionist Citizens party actually came first). This is a major embarrassment for Spain\u2019s PM, Mariano Rajoy, and a significant boost to the independence movement who are pushing for Catalonia to break away. Less than two months ago, Rajoy dissolved the previous parliament after it declared independence. This is going to spark a wave of selling in Madrid, and also weaken Spanish government bond prices. Reuters has the details: Spain\u2019s IBEX futures opened down 1.2 percent before tumbling further, last down 1.8 percent and indicating a sharp fall at the open as the country\u2019s political crisis, which has damaged the economy and caused a business exodus from Catalonia,deepened. Spanish bond yields also edged higher in early deals. Spain\u2019s 10-year borrowing costs were up 4 basis points, to 1.515%. Euro zone stocks were also set for a downbeat open with Euro STOXX 50 futures down 0.5%. This latest twist is also likely to drag Britain\u2019s FTSE down from yesterday\u2019s record high (the blue-chip index closed over 7,600 points for the first time at 7,603). It\u2019s not quite clear what will happen next in Spain, as my colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen report from Barcelona: Much will now depend on what the pro-independence parties agree. Puigdemont is facing arrest if he returns to Spain and fractures have appeared between him and Junqueras, who has appeared to take a more moderate line on independence. The vote is the latest chapter in Spain\u2019s worst political crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago. The results will be bruising for Rajoy and will do nothing to heal divisions in the region, which remains deeply and evenly divided over the independence issue. Any solution to the vexed question of Catalan sovereignty remains as elusive as ever. Also coming up today, we get a final estimate of Britain\u2019s economy performance in the third quarter of this year. These national accounts are likely to confirm that GDP rose by 0.4% in July to September, and will also show business investment and the balance of payments.

Puigdemont is facing arrest if he returns to Spain and fractures have appeared between him and Junqueras, who has appeared to take a more moderate line on independence.</p> <p>The vote is the latest chapter in Spain\u2019s worst political crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago. The results will be bruising for Rajoy and will do nothing to heal divisions in the region, which remains deeply and evenly divided over the independence issue. Any solution to the vexed question of Catalan sovereignty remains as elusive as ever.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/21/catalonia-election-set-to-give-victory-to-pro-independence-parties\">Catalan pro-independence parties keep their majority in snap poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Also coming up today</strong>, we get a final estimate of Britain\u2019s economy performance in the third quarter of this year.</p> <p>These national accounts are likely to confirm that GDP rose by 0.4% in July to September, and will also show business investment and the balance of payments.<br></p> <h2>The agenda:</h2> <ul> <li><strong>9.30am GMT:</strong> Final estimate of UK GDP for the third quarter of 2017<br></li> <li><strong>1.30pm GMT:</strong> Canadian GDP for October<br></li> <li><strong>1.30pm GMT:</strong> US durable goods and personal income figures</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-12-22T08:00:27.223Z\">at 8.00am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been decades since families gathered round record players to listen to the new pile of records stacked among the torn wrapping paper on Christmas morning. However, LPs will be crackling and popping in living rooms all over the country this year as Britons give new turntables a spin after the gadget became one of the must-have gifts of 2017. Retailers including HMV and Richer Sounds have reported bumper turntable sales this year, while John Lewis has sold out of eight of the 20 models it stocked, as millennials and fortysomethings catch the vinyl bug. Phil Jubb, purchasing director at hi-fi and TV specialist Richer Sounds, said turntable sales had increased by 70% in recent years: \u201cThis has been across the board at all prices. It goes to show that a great record player is part of any good sound system.\u201d The vinyl scene used to be dominated by male baby boomers reliving their youth through record collections skewed towards heritage rock acts such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Oasis and Radiohead. But recent research by the BPI, the UK music industry\u2019s trade body, found a broadening demographic with under 35s making nearly a quarter of all vinyl purchases and one in four records bought by women. With record players costing anything from \u00a325 to over \u00a320,000, the appetite for vinyl among teenagers and students has encouraged manufacturers to produce cheaper models, including retro suitcase style players and brightly coloured ones costing less than \u00a3100. HMV\u2019s Simon Winter said the retailer would sell close to 60,000 turntables this year, compared with 50,000 in 2016. A turntable will be the top selling product in its technology department this Christmas, ahead of both headphones and speaker docks, he added. John Lewis said its shoppers were increasingly interested in sound quality with slightly more expensive models, like those made by Japan\u2019s Audio-Technica, in demand this year. \u201cSales of turntables have been steadily rising over the past few years,\u201d said Will Jones, head of communications technology buying at John Lewis. \u201cBut we\u2019ve seen a 20% increase in sales of higher end turntables this year.\u201d In recent years vinyl sales have rocketed as the shift to consuming music via streaming services hits sales of CDs and downloads. The BPI predicts more than 4m records will be sold in the UK this year, the highest since it began collecting data in the early 1990s. Sales at this level would represent a 30% increase on 2016 and a remarkable comeback for a format that looked doomed in 2007 when just 205,000 records were sold. With CD sales now in sharp decline manufacturers are expanding their turntable ranges to cater for the different types of vinyl buyer. Last year saw the return of DJ favourite, the Technics SL-1200, which had been discontinued in 2010. The design classic is aimed at consumers who used to mix records in their bedrooms but have grown up and got more money to spend on their music set up. Mike Burn, store manager of London based hi-fi specialist Infidelity, said the company never stopped selling record players albeit only to an audiophile market where enthusiasts are willing to spend several thousand pounds on a speaker cable. \u201cYou can get into spending thousands of pounds because you can custom build them like a Rolls-Royce,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been selling record players non-stop for the last 25 years. There\u2019s a ritualistic thing about it. It\u2019s a bit more special than picking up an iPad to open a different app.\u201d The vinyl resurgence led to the reinstatement of official weekly charts dedicated to the format in 2015. This year\u2019s top selling albums will be Ed Sheeran\u2019s Divide, as well as the solo output of both Liam and Noel Gallagher, formerly of Oasis. Retailers are reporting growth across all genres as Britons use streaming services like Spotify to discover and then buy new music. However, with just over a quarter of all vinyl purchases made in December and well over 250,000 bought this week alone, the last vinyl chart before Christmas gives a sense of what tunes may be spinning while the turkey is cooking. Noel Gallagher\u2019s Who Built the Moon looks to have secured the coveted number one slot but the top 20 is nothing if not eclectic, as Fleetwood Mac\u2019s 1977 album Rumours hangs on at number three after 125 weeks on the chart, while Eminem and Pink are also battling the might of the crowd-pleasing compilation Now That\u2019s What I Call Christmas.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cHow\u2019d you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? How\u2019d you like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?\u201d For the night shift, heading home after nine hours filling shelves with Hatchimals, Play-Doh and Lego in one of toy chain The Entertainer\u2019s busiest London stores, escape \u2013 perhaps even just from the in-store music \u2013 looks an appealing prospect. Saturday promises to deliver the retailer\u2019s biggest takings of the year after a fraught Christmas trading period, as poor industry-wide sales were compounded by the woes of loss-making rival Toys R Us, which has struck an eleventh hour pension deal to avoid administration. Gary Grant, the family-run chain\u2019s managing director and founder, is not afraid to get his hands dirty and at breakfast time on Wednesday is stuffing handfuls of Beanie Boo soft toys into a display near the front of its Westfield London store ahead of the morning rush. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough year,\u201d said Grant, who fears sales in December, the most lucrative time of the year for toy chains, will fall short of last Christmas. \u201cWe had a good run until September but October was average, then November was terrible \u2013 down 9% \u2013 and unfortunately December has continued in that vein.\u201d Toy specialists have been in the eye of a storm in recent years amid intense price competition from aggressive online players such as Amazon, as well as supermarkets. Prices were pushed up by last year\u2019s Brexit blow to the pound, which increased the cost of importing goods from the far east, masking declines in the number of toys sold. While the year\u2019s hottest toys, such as Fingerlings (small animatronic monkeys which cling to your finger) and Luvabella dolls are like gold dust, The Entertainer started its clearance sale a week early to ensure it could offload other unsold toys after taking a view on the depressed pattern of trade. But while other rivals race to make up lost sales over the weekend, all 150 of The Entertainer\u2019s shops will be closed on Christmas Eve because Grant, a devout Christian, always gives his staff Sundays off \u2013 even though this year that means missing out on several million pounds worth of sales. Do staff think he\u2019s mad to stay closed? \u201cNo they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey trust me. I want my staff to have a day of rest and spend time with their families.\u201d Toys R Us\u2019s landlords have agreed to a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a restructuring plan that will result in the closure of 26 stores in the new year and reduce the size of other outlets. The retailer\u2019s US parent filed for bankruptcy protection in September and by shedding its worst stores, it is hoped the lossmaking UK chain can have a future. During this decade the number of UK toy shops has declined by nearly 6% to 1,200, according to property analyst Local Data Company. The fall is steeper than for other retail sectors such as fashion and is against a backdrop of huge online growth. Internet toy sales have increased more than 60% over the last five years and now account for 37% of the market, according to retail consultancy GlobalData. Despite such huge changes, The Entertainer has thrived by opening stores on busy high streets and in shopping centres including Westfield London in Shepherd\u2019s Bush. By comparison Toys R Us has struggled as the large out-of-town sheds that are the US brand\u2019s calling card fall out of favour. It has also been hit by the arrival of a tough new retail park competitor, Irish chain Smyths Toys, at a time when stiff online competition means parents expect a distilled version of blockbuster toy shop Hamleys from their local store. \u201cI hope when you conjure up a toy shop in your mind you see an Entertainer,\u201d said Grant. The retailer will open another 15 shops in 2018 and temporarily close Westfield London, one of its top three stores, for a \u00a3600,000 refurbishment that will include new interactive displays. \u201cI don\u2019t see Toys R Us as a toy shop. It\u2019s a large shed that sells toys. I\u2019m not sure they have the magic parents remember from their childhood toy shop.\u201d Some suppliers stopped delivering stock to Toys R Us in the autumn because they were having difficulty securing the credit insurance that would protect them if the chain failed. The powerful insurers pulled in their horns during the last consumer downturn and there are signs they are looking to do so again. \u201cWe work closely with our credit insurers because they are more powerful than our bank,\u201d explained Grant. \u201cThey have rung us in the last month asking how trading is and for more up-to-date management accounts. They are nervous, and probably not without good reason, not necessarily of the toy industry but of the whole high street.\u201d This weekend\u2019s dash to the shops will help save Christmas for some retailers, with Grant reporting a huge pickup in trade in the last 48 hours when we speak again on Friday morning. \u201cI sent a video round the shops to say life is OK, it\u2019s just not as good as we thought it was going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have had an unbelievable year but now it\u2019s just going to be very good.\u201d",

Prices were pushed up by last year\u2019s Brexit blow to the pound, which increased the cost of importing goods from the far east, masking declines in the number of toys sold.</p> <p>While the year\u2019s hottest toys, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/08/fidget-spinners-and-fingerlings-help-toy-firm-buck-downward-market-trend\">such as Fingerlings</a> (small animatronic monkeys which cling to your finger) and Luvabella dolls are like gold dust, The Entertainer started its clearance sale a week early to ensure it could offload other unsold toys after taking a view on the depressed pattern of trade. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ba999ff29ce14ac2e98665f3977c031710a73ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ba999ff29ce14ac2e98665f3977c031710a73ee/509_977_4772_2863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child plays with Fingerlings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers are keen to get their hands on the hottest toys such as Fingerlings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while other rivals race to make up lost sales over the weekend, all 150 of The Entertainer\u2019s shops will be closed on Christmas Eve because Grant, a devout Christian, always gives his staff Sundays off \u2013 even though this year that means missing out on several million pounds worth of sales.<br></p> <p>Do staff think he\u2019s mad to stay closed? \u201cNo they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey trust me.

The retailer\u2019s US parent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/19/toys-r-us-files-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us-and-canada\">filed for bankruptcy protection in September</a> and by shedding its worst stores, it is hoped the lossmaking UK chain can have a future.</p> <p>During this decade the number of UK toy shops has declined by nearly 6% to 1,200, according to property analyst Local Data Company. </p> <p>The fall is steeper than for other retail sectors such as fashion and is against a backdrop of huge online growth. Internet toy sales have increased more than 60% over the last five years and now account for 37% of the market, according to retail consultancy GlobalData.</p> <p>Despite such huge changes, The Entertainer has thrived by opening stores on busy high streets and in shopping centres including Westfield London in Shepherd\u2019s Bush. </p> <p>By comparison Toys R Us has struggled as the large out-of-town sheds that are the US brand\u2019s calling card fall out of favour. It has also been hit by the arrival of a tough new retail park competitor, Irish chain Smyths Toys, at a time when stiff online competition means parents expect a distilled version of blockbuster toy shop Hamleys from their local store.</p> <p>\u201cI hope when you conjure up a toy shop in your mind you see an Entertainer,\u201d said Grant. The retailer will open another 15 shops in 2018 and temporarily close Westfield London, one of its top three stores, for a \u00a3600,000 refurbishment that will include new interactive displays. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see Toys R Us as a toy shop. It\u2019s a large shed that sells toys. I\u2019m not sure they have the magic parents remember from their childhood toy shop.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Some suppliers stopped delivering stock to Toys R Us in the autumn because they were having difficulty securing the credit insurance that would protect them if the chain failed. The powerful insurers pulled in their horns during the last consumer downturn and there are signs they are looking to do so again.</p> <p>\u201cWe work closely with our credit insurers because they are more powerful than our bank,\u201d explained Grant. \u201cThey have rung us in the last month asking how trading is and for more up-to-date management accounts. They are nervous, and probably not without good reason, not necessarily of the toy industry but of the whole high street.\u201d</p> <p>This weekend\u2019s dash to the shops will help save Christmas for some retailers, with Grant reporting a huge pickup in trade in the last 48 hours when we speak again on Friday morning. \u201cI sent a video round the shops to say life is OK, it\u2019s just not as good as we thought it was going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have had an unbelievable year but now it\u2019s just going to be very good.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Spending by UK households slowed to its lowest level in almost six years during 2017 as the impact of higher inflation hit living standards and forced people to prioritise their basic needs. The latest official figures show that consumers spent less on restaurants and hotels in the three months ending in September, but more on food, rent, fuel bills and transport. The Office for National Statistics said household spending rose by 0.5% in the third quarter, but was just 1% higher than a year earlier \u2013 the slowest annual growth since early 2012. Living standards have been squeezed as a result of the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016. The annual inflation rate has risen from below 1% to more than 3%, while earnings have been growing at an annual rate of just over 2% despite a steady fall in unemployment to a 42-year low of 4.3%. Economists said there was some evidence from the ONS data of a rebalancing of the economy away from consumption and toward the other components of growth. Growth in business investment during the third quarter was revised up from 0.2% to 0.5%, while net trade \u2013 which measures the difference between import and export growth \u2013 ceased to be a drag on the economy. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK said: \u201cThe final figures for the third quarter paint a picture of a significantly weaker domestic economy but a more positive exports performance. Weaker government spending and a marginal downward revision to consumer spending were offset by an upward revision to investment and a rise in exports, as companies took advantage of the weak pound and bourgeoning growth momentum in many of the UK\u2019s key trading partners. \u201cConsumer spending was a key driver of growth in the third quarter, however the rise in spending centred on households\u2019 basic needs such as electricity, gas and fuel, as well as housing rent and transport. Spending on discretionary treats like restaurants and hotels actually declined, as a squeeze on real incomes made consumers more careful with their spending.\u201d In its latest update on the state of the economy, the ONS reported growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, unchanged on its previous estimates but slightly higher than the 0.3% recorded in each of the first two quarters. Revisions to previous data meant, however, that annual growth in the year to the third quarter has been adjusted up from 1.5% to 1.7%. The City is expecting the economy to expand by 0.4% in the final three months of 2017, making the UK one of the slowest growing members of the G7 group of leading industrialised nations. The eurozone grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of the year. The ONS said the 0.5% increase in household spending between the second and third quarters was the result of consumers running down their savings. Consumer spending was strong in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, growing by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2016, but has since expanded more slowly. Paul Hollingsworth, a UK analyst at Capital Economics, said the ONS figures revealed a more balanced growth picture, with household spending revised down but business investment revised up from 0.2% to 0.5%. \u201cThe economy looks to have maintained this pace in Q4,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should mean that GDP growth for 2017 as a whole should come in at about 1.8%.\u201d The ONS\u2019s head of national accounts, Darren Morgan, said: \u201cToday\u2019s unrevised third quarter figures show most of the growth came from the dominant service sector, with accounting, recruitment agencies and retailing all performing well. \u201cManufacturing also boosted growth thanks to an increase in exports and the introduction of new car models. Meanwhile, household spending and business investment both grew steadily.\u201d Britain\u2019s balance of payments deficit with the rest of the world narrowed from 5.1% of GDP in the second quarter to 4.5% in the third quarter. The improvement was mainly the result of UK investors securing higher returns on their overseas holdings than overseas investors made on their holdings in Britain.",
