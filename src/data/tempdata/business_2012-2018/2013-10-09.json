      "body": "<p>Every year, the business magazine Forbes prepares a list of the world\u2019s most powerful women. Next year, most of them will be moving down a place. Jostling Angela Merkel for the top slot will be Janet Yellen, an academic economist and expert on unemployment, Barack Obama\u2019s choice as next chairman of the US Federal Reserve.</p> <p>Yellen will be the first woman to head America\u2019s central bank in its 100-year history, and her appointment \u2013 which has to be ratified by the Senate \u2013 comes at a critical time, because the Fed's moves in the coming months and years will reverberate through economies around the world.</p> <p>Unlike the man described as the rock star of central bankers, Mark Carney of the Bank of England, Yellen is a self-effacing academic who has spent much of her career working behind the scenes at the Fed and teaching students. Her idea of fun is stamp collecting and hosting dinner parties.</p> <p>\u201cThe president could not have found a better qualified candidate for this historic nomination,\u201d said Sheila Bair, former chair of the US bank regulator. \u201cThroughout her career, Janet Yellen has demonstrated a real commitment to public service, and sincere desire for a stable financial system which fulfills the needs of the real economy.\u201d</p> <p>Yellen\u2019s most crucial dilemma will be to decide when \u2013 or how \u2013 to turn off the flood of cheap money the Fed has been pouring into the US economy \u2013 at a rate of $85bn a month \u2013 to kickstart America's recovery.&#xa0;</p> <p>When Ben Bernanke,&#xa0;the current chairman, even suggested he might be ready to start winding down the programme in May, markets from South America to southern Asia reacted violently.</p> <p>Yellen has been known as a staunch supporter of Bernanke\u2019s medicine: \u201cThe biggest thing it does is represent continuity in terms of the policies that the Fed has had in place for a while,\u201d said Karim Basta, director of economic research and chief investment strategist at the hedge fund III Associates. \u201cShe was the architect of those.\u201d</p> <p>Yellen, is currently Bernanke\u2019s No 2 and spearheaded many of the policies that have characterized Bernanke\u2019s more open approach to communication. She encouraged the Federal Reserve to set specific targets for inflation and unemployment, to hold more press conferences to explain their actions, and publish the forecasts of each voting member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors.&#xa0;</p> <p>Analysis by the Wall Street Journal shows that time and again, her forecasts were most accurate of those on the board. Yellen was not, however, Obama\u2019s first choice for the job. She won the nomination only after a long and unusually public battle that pitched her against one of the president\u2019s key advisers, former Treasury secretary Larry Summers.</p> <p>Summers withdrew from the race as it became clear that he would face serious opposition from Obama\u2019s own party, namely senators worried about the former Clinton adviser\u2019s history of helping deregulate financial markets.</p> <p>While Summers faced opposition from the left, Yellen, a Democrat, is already facing opposition from rightwing senators concerned by her continuing support of Bernanke\u2019s quantitative easing programme, which they believe undermines the dollar and risks unleashing inflation.</p> <p>Even within the White House it is unclear how much support Yellen really has. Obama aides appear to have been briefing against her in the run up to the nomination, describing her as methodical, meticulous and somewhat distant. She was not a \u201cteam player\u201d, anonymous sources suggested to media outlets.</p> <p>But if anyone is prepared for a fight, it\u2019s the diminutive Yellen. \u201cJanet is very tough \u2013 tough in her views and tough in her independence,\u201d Laura D\u2019Andrea Tyson, a friend and former Clinton administration official told USA Today.</p> <p>Yellen\u2019s career in economics began at Brown University, in Rhode Island, in 1963, she graduated from there with top honours in 1967. A Fed insider since 1977, when she was an economist with the board of governors, Yellen has consistently shown she is prepared to speak her mind. Compared to her somewhat gnomic boss, she is a model of clarity.</p> <p>Before the housing crash, when Bernanke was still dismissing signs of a price bubble, and Yellen was San Francisco Fed president, she warned fellow Fed policy makers there was \u201ca 600lb gorilla in the room, and that is the housing sector\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Every year, the business magazine Forbes prepares a list of the world\u2019s most powerful women. Next year, most of them will be moving down a place. Jostling Angela Merkel for the top slot will be Janet Yellen, an academic economist and expert on unemployment, Barack Obama\u2019s choice as next chairman of the US Federal Reserve. Yellen will be the first woman to head America\u2019s central bank in its 100-year history, and her appointment \u2013 which has to be ratified by the Senate \u2013 comes at a critical time, because the Fed's moves in the coming months and years will reverberate through economies around the world. Unlike the man described as the rock star of central bankers, Mark Carney of the Bank of England, Yellen is a self-effacing academic who has spent much of her career working behind the scenes at the Fed and teaching students. Her idea of fun is stamp collecting and hosting dinner parties. \u201cThe president could not have found a better qualified candidate for this historic nomination,\u201d said Sheila Bair, former chair of the US bank regulator. \u201cThroughout her career, Janet Yellen has demonstrated a real commitment to public service, and sincere desire for a stable financial system which fulfills the needs of the real economy.\u201d Yellen\u2019s most crucial dilemma will be to decide when \u2013 or how \u2013 to turn off the flood of cheap money the Fed has been pouring into the US economy \u2013 at a rate of $85bn a month \u2013 to kickstart America's recovery. When Ben Bernanke, the current chairman, even suggested he might be ready to start winding down the programme in May, markets from South America to southern Asia reacted violently. Yellen has been known as a staunch supporter of Bernanke\u2019s medicine: \u201cThe biggest thing it does is represent continuity in terms of the policies that the Fed has had in place for a while,\u201d said Karim Basta, director of economic research and chief investment strategist at the hedge fund III Associates. \u201cShe was the architect of those.\u201d Yellen, is currently Bernanke\u2019s No 2 and spearheaded many of the policies that have characterized Bernanke\u2019s more open approach to communication. She encouraged the Federal Reserve to set specific targets for inflation and unemployment, to hold more press conferences to explain their actions, and publish the forecasts of each voting member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors. Analysis by the Wall Street Journal shows that time and again, her forecasts were most accurate of those on the board. Yellen was not, however, Obama\u2019s first choice for the job. She won the nomination only after a long and unusually public battle that pitched her against one of the president\u2019s key advisers, former Treasury secretary Larry Summers. Summers withdrew from the race as it became clear that he would face serious opposition from Obama\u2019s own party, namely senators worried about the former Clinton adviser\u2019s history of helping deregulate financial markets. While Summers faced opposition from the left, Yellen, a Democrat, is already facing opposition from rightwing senators concerned by her continuing support of Bernanke\u2019s quantitative easing programme, which they believe undermines the dollar and risks unleashing inflation. Even within the White House it is unclear how much support Yellen really has. Obama aides appear to have been briefing against her in the run up to the nomination, describing her as methodical, meticulous and somewhat distant. She was not a \u201cteam player\u201d, anonymous sources suggested to media outlets. But if anyone is prepared for a fight, it\u2019s the diminutive Yellen. \u201cJanet is very tough \u2013 tough in her views and tough in her independence,\u201d Laura D\u2019Andrea Tyson, a friend and former Clinton administration official told USA Today. Yellen\u2019s career in economics began at Brown University, in Rhode Island, in 1963, she graduated from there with top honours in 1967. A Fed insider since 1977, when she was an economist with the board of governors, Yellen has consistently shown she is prepared to speak her mind. Compared to her somewhat gnomic boss, she is a model of clarity. Before the housing crash, when Bernanke was still dismissing signs of a price bubble, and Yellen was San Francisco Fed president, she warned fellow Fed policy makers there was \u201ca 600lb gorilla in the room, and that is the housing sector\u201d. She said the risk of a house prices crash and vast numbers of people losing their homes was causing her \u201cappreciable angst\u201d. But Yellen has acknowledged that she did little to rein in the 600lb gorilla. The San Francisco Fed oversaw the mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, once the largest sub-prime home loan lender in the US. Yellen admitted to a congressional commission investigating the financial crisis in 2010 that the Fed did not do enough to halt its excesses. The rulebook written to curb excessive risk-taking by banks were inadequate, she told the congressmen. \u201cYou could take this, rip it up, and throw it in the garbage can.\u201d While she foresaw many of the issues that would trigger the worst recession in living memory, Yellen did not force through tougher regulation. Much of Yellen\u2019s academic research \u2013 often carried out with her husband, fellow Berkeley economics professor George Akerlof, who is a Nobel prize winner \u2013 has focused on the costs and causes of unemployment. \u201cThese are not just statistics to me. We know that long-term unemployment is devastating to workers and their families,\u201d she said in a speech to a trade union in February. For Yellen, economics is not a dry subject: it is about real lives, and she believes it is worth risking a little inflation if it results in jobs. She has also analysed single motherhood, denying it is a result of welfare payments and blaming it on a decline in shotgun weddings. The economics gene has been passed to Yellen and Akerlof\u2019s son. Robert Akerlof teaches economics at Warwick University. He may well have picked up the basics at mealtimes \u2013 his mother joked in 1995 that dinner at her house meant \u201ca diet that is richer in discussions of economics and policy issues than many people would find appetising.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Janet Yellen is the right woman for the biggest job in global policymaking \u2013 but no one should underestimate how tough her task will be. One major factor in Yellen's favour is that she is not Larry Summers \u2013 the other main candidate and the showboating former Clinton adviser whose role in stoking the bonfire of banking regulations that helped cause the crisis was so cruelly exposed in the film, Inside Job. But the most important reason we should cheer her appointment is that Yellen is a formidable economist, and an impressive communicator. She has shrewdly navigated the crisis of the past five years, advocating robust, early intervention to prevent a 21st-century Great Depression, and has focused unstintingly on unemployment. Anyone in doubt should take the time to peruse some of the transcripts from the Federal open market committee's policy meetings. Unfortunately, since they're released with a super-cautious six-year time lag, we can only trace the tale up to 2007; but even from that August, when the first signs of distress were appearing in financial markets, and with many policymakers, not least in the UK, set to remain in deep denial for another year at least, Yellen was already announcing that, \"we are looking at a credit crunch \u2013 signs of it are everywhere\". By December, she was musing that, \"the risk of recession no longer seems remote\". And while some in Congress have decried her as a reckless dove who could jeopardise the Fed's focus on inflation, back in 1996, when the Greenspan Fed was still in the grip of the idea that a near-miraculous increase in productivity was allowing the economy to expand rapidly without sparking inflation, Yellen warned the chair she believed the US was \"operating in an inflationary danger zone\", saying that she would have voted for a rate rise if the option had been on the table. But as the International Monetary Fund's Olivier Blanchard warned on Tuesday, today's Fed faces a \"new and delicate\" challenge in extricating the US \u2013 and the world \u2013 from its unprecedented, $85bn-a-month policy of quantitative easing. A Yellen Fed will take a cautious approach, waiting for the hoped-for improvement in the labour market instead of sticking to a pre-set timetable. But as the IMF's Global Financial Stability Review showed on Wednesday, the consequences for the world's financial markets when tapering does get underway are unpredictable, and if Yellen and her colleagues get their timing wrong, potentially devastating.",

Stability Report</strong></a> is that interest rates could rise sharply when the task of unwinding QE begins.</p> <p>The speed of the rise in borrowing costs, not the size of it, is crucial to whether the world economy is hit by a destabilising panic.</p> <p><strong>Observer economics editor Heather Stewart explains:&#xa0;</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the US Federal Reserve starts to phase out its $85bn-a-month quantitative easing programme it could spark a rapid rise in global interest rates and \u201cfire sales\u201d of assets across the world\u2019s financial markets, according to the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>In the latest edition of its twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF said markets have become riskier over the past six months as investors have begun to adjust to the prospect of an end to QE in the US.</p> <p>Its analysts laid out a relatively benign scenario, in which market interest rates adjust gradually to a world without the flow of cheap money from the Fed.</p> <p>But they warned that there is also an \u201cadverse scenario\u201d, which would involve investors taking a $2.3tn hit amid \u201ca rapid tightening in financial conditions, potentially aggravated by reduced market liquidity and forced asset sales\u201d.</p> <p>The IMF describes the markets\u2019 so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d earlier this year, after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke mooted the idea of \u201ctapering\u201d QE, as a \u201cmini stress test\u201d, which helped to reveal how investors might respond as monetary policy returns to normal.</p> <p>Its adverse scenario involves the same increase in long-term interest rates \u2013 1 percentage point \u2013 as the benign scenario, but over a much shorter time-period.</p>

She has voted for rate hikes 20 times during her Fed career and is not so much a dove as an aggressive advocate of monetary policy. Yellen will maintain monetary easing when the economy is weak, but isn\u2019t afraid to tighten policy when the time comes.</p> <p>Yellen could be seen as a wise choice considering the markets adverse reaction to the prospect of a slowdown in QE. The Fed is in a hapless position, taper and the very recovery which had caused the policy move is at risk, but fail to taper and market bubbles continue to inflate, bringing the economy ever closer to a burst. The best advice is to proceed slowly and with caution and Yellen\u2019s will provide just that.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5255370fe4b0814d97846c9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-09T11:19:38.854Z\">12.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility's full report into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/09/us-debt-deadlock-keeps-gnawing-at-markets-live#block-525535c1e4b0099005df36d6\"><strong>its forecasting performance</strong> </a>is online here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/pubs/FER2013.pdf\"><strong>Forecast evaluation report \u2013 October 2013&#xa0;</strong></a></h2> <p>This chart (<em>on page 21</em>) shows how the UK economy's performance (second graph) failed to meet the OBS's forecast (<em>top graph</em>).

This may make it easier for Ireland to exit the bailout in 2014 and restore full economic sovereignty.</p> <p>This upbeat assessment of the economy comes as the Fine Gael-Labour coalition finalise plans for next week's 2014 budget.</p> <p>In a bid to soften up the public before budget day, further leaks of what it contains include some good news for the country's police force and pensioners. The freeze of Garda recruitment will be lifted and new officers brought in while there will no cuts to old age pensions in the budget.</p> <p>While Labour minister Joan Burton is under pressure to deliver tens of milions of cuts in the social welfare budget there is speculation that the projected \u20ac440m of cuts may be lower than that figure.</p> <p>Clearly the overall message Enda Kenny's government is trying to transmit after its surprising defeat in last Friday's referendum vote on the future of Ireland's second parliamentary chamber, is that this will be the least harshest budget over the last half decade and may signal that the economy is turning around.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p>But as this piece published by Bloomberg yesterday showed, the Irish economy has been badly hurt by the years of austerity since its bank sector blew up:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-07/steak-no-more-in-yeats-country-depicting-scant-recovery-economy.html\"><strong>Steak No More in Yeats Country Amid Scant Irish Recovery</strong></a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ObsoleteDogma/statuses/387611276928491520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Another austerity success story in Ireland!

      "bodyText": "Our story about the Royal Mail selloff is online here: Royal Mail shares: 700,000 applications made, says Vince Cable More than 700,000 people have applied for shares in Royal Mail \u2013 making it one of the country's most sought after privatisations. Vince Cable, the business secretary, said members of the public have placed orders for more than seven times the number of shares available \u2013 meaning ordinary people could have bought all of the company if 70% of the available flotation had not been reserved for City investors and pension funds. \"We haven't yet got the final figures but my very rough estimate is that we've had about 700,000 applications and it's about seven times oversubscribed,\" Cable told MPs on Wednesday. The frenzy for shares \u2013 sparked by expectations of near-instant 20-30% paper returns when trading begins on Friday \u2013 is more intense than demand for British Gas or British Telecom at the height of privatisation fever in the 1980 and 1990s. And that's a good time to stop. Here's my earlier summary &amp; reaction to Vince Cable's appearance. Coverage of all today's events, starting with the news that Janet Yellen is the next Fed chair, starts here. Back tomorrow. Thanks, and goodnight. GW Janet Yellen's appointment, to be confirmed in a couple of hour's time, has helped to push the Dow Jones up 60 points so far today. There is also currently a little optimism that Congressional leaders could make progress towards ending the government shutdown (Marketwatch has the details) Another day of losses across most of Europe's stock markets, pushed down once again by jitters over America's debt ceiling deadlock. The optimism created by Janet Yellen's appointment as Fed chair (which should be confirmed tonight) didn't last long. The FTSE 100 fell 27 points, or 0.44%, to a new three-month low. Nick Fletcher had the full story here: FTSE falters as US debt worries drag on, but builders lifted by Help to Buy I missed one point towards the end of Cable's session that could be important in future. Fortunately the Daily Telegraph's Denise Roland got it. Basically, the committee pointed out that BNP Paribas, one of the groups that helped the government set a value range for the shares, has a contract with Royal Mail. Is that a conflict of interest? Cable is going to check the precise arrangement, telling MPs that he was told \"categorically\" it was an \"independent\" valuation. And here's a video-clip of Vince Cable in action: A quick catch-up of the key points on Vince Cable's appearance before the Business, Innovation and Skills committee (highlights start here). \u2022 The sale of Royal Mail is a hit with the public. More than 700,000 people have applied to take part, at the last count, with total bids meaning it's seven-times over-subscribed. Clearly all the reports that it's seriously undervalued sent many people rushing to take part before last night's deadline. Cable's warning that it's not for \"widows and orphans\" may give some second thoughts -- or encourage them to sell quickly. That will mean more 'froth' (Cable's words) when trading begins next week. There's also going to be a political stink if, as seems certain, shares hit 400p (from a float price of probably 330p). The government can't hide behind the 'froth' defence for long...... \u2022 The government intends to make sure 'responsible' City firms get the shares. That's a fascinating suggestion -- will the Business department be sifting Good investment banks from Bad ones? And are hedge funds, say, less responsible investors than the rest? Cable, once a leading critic of City speculation, insists the shares will go to responsible investors. We'll soon see which firms meet his standards.... \u2022 MPs are very concerned that Royal Mail's property assets are undervalued, and may hold Cable accountable. There's a major discrepancy between the \u00a3787m that the assets are valued in the float document, and some of the informal valuations of London properties such as the Mount Pleasant sorting offices in the capital (could it be worth \u00a31bn?). Cable said a windfall tax wouldn't be sensible. So what will the government do if we discover that there's been a blunder? \u2022 Cable needs a better answer on workers' shares, and the three-year lock-in. There was the distinct sound of the business secretary's bails being disturbed at one point in his innings -- when Brian Binlay MPs asked if a postal worker who quit before 2017 to move house would keep his shares, but one who was fired for punching a colleague would lose them. Either the shares belong to the workers now, or they don't. \u2022 There's no guarantee that Royal Mail will maintain its universal service obligation in the long-term, or keep its tie-up with the Post Office in a decade's time. It will come down to MPs willingness, or not, to amend legislation. Oh, and there was a small demonstration outside Portcullis House during the session. The flotation can't be halted now, but unions aren't stopping their protests either: Committee chairman Adrian Bailey draws the session to a close, telling Vince Cable that MPs are not entirely satisfied. \"It's fair to say there is a degree of scepticism\", he tells the business secretary, but we will see how the process proceeds. In time, it should be clear how well the sale of Royal Mail has been handled. And that's the end of the session. Now onto pay -- does Cable expect that Royal Mail CEO Moya Greene's pay packet will rise, fall, or stay the same once Royal Mail is a private company? He replies that there's nothing in the flotation itself to mean Greene should get a remuneration boost. Next question - about the possibility that Scotland could shake-up the postal network if it votes for independence. Would there be value in relieving Royal Mail from a universal service obligation north of the border? Cable says he \"doesn't know what Mr [Alex] Salmon's intentions are towards the universal service obligation\". He then says that the cost of the USO in Scotland is \u00a3630m, if you assume that it's population density and geography is the UK average. But it probably isn't. I suspect a separate renationalised Royal Mail would have higher net costs in Scotland then the rest of the UK, but I don't have the full facts, Cable adds. The committee is very concerned that the Royal Mail is going to lobby the government to water down its service obligations. Cable says that they'll have to lobby the regulator (Ofcom) instead, and suggests that the scope for eroding the controls is pretty limited. One MPs criticises the government for putting \"enormous commercial pressure\" on Royal Mail, by opening up the market to competition. Cable says it's not the government, it's a European directive to open up postal services. Onto the universal service obligation.. and the committee remind Cable that the government briefly misled the House of Commons last month by saying that the six-day service could only be changed by primary legislation. Apparently a 'affirmative procedure' could change it. This has already been corrected on the official record, but means it would be a little easier for the commitment to be toned down (details here!). Cable replies that it would still require parliament's approval, so it's not much different. Yet the commitment to deliver a letter anywhere in the country is protected by primary legislation? Yes, says Cable, because even under a universal service obligation some services are more important than others. Cable reminds MPs that Royal Mail's management has already laid off 50,000 people in recent years. No-one could say that this isn't an aggressive, tough commercial operation. How will the government use its shareholding to keep Royal Mail behaving properly as a private firm? Cable says that the government will still have a substantial private shareholding, but adds that it doesn't expect to meddle in the company's everyday work. Could Royal Mail break its link with the Post Office? Cable says he can't see why the two would want to break up when their current partnership ends in 2022. MPs have moved onto branding. Could Royal Mail abuse its Royal tag, or rebrand to something like 'Consignia?' Cable replies that there's a deal with the Royal Family to ensure it can keep using the title. He adds that he doesn't think\" the Royal Mail trademark could leave the group, but is going to check.... Cable is now being pummelled over whether Royal Mail staff will lose their shares if they leave the company during the three-year lock-in period. He agrees that it feels unfair that someone could lose their allocation for factors out of their control. Then, after a brief consultation with his advisors, he explains that a lot of thought has gone into protecting shares given to people who lose their jobs through redundancy or disability. What about people who had to move house and give up their job? They'd still be 'good leavers', Cable suggests. But not if they punch someone, asks Conservative MP Brian Binley. Won't this mean the locked-up shares could be used as a tool to influence staff? Cable doesn't look too sure, saying: Maybe I need to do some more detailed work\u2026 The committee chairman, Adrian Bailey MP, also quizzes Cable on Royal Mail's property portfolio. Would you consider a windfall tax on Royal Mail, he asks, if it transpires that the government blundered by undervaluing its property portfolio. Cable replies that there are circumstances in which a windfall tax have some merits, and I've argued for them in the past. But not this time, it appears. It's wrong to single out one part of a company's business just because it had a good result. Cable adds that there is an issue of accountability, if a mistake has been made (indeed!) However, \"randomly imposing \"a windfall tax on certain transactions (such as a hypothetical Mount Pleasant sale) doesn't seem good. He adds that the question feels highly loaded -- implying that someone is culpable of an error. MPs are also grilling Cable on the issue of Royal Mail's property assets. They're worried that the company's properties have been seriously undervalued, particularly sites in London. In its sale prospectus, Royal Mail estimated the value of its estate, which includes more than 2,000 properties across the country, at just \u00a3787m. Yet, the Mount Pleasant sorting office in Clerkenwell, London, alone could bring in \u00a31bn, an MP points out. Cable claims that the \u00a31bn estimate is off-beam, based on similar property sales. Katy Clark MP chases the point down. Is there any mechanism to claw back money if it turns out that Royal Mail was undervalued because of the property portfolio? Cable suggests there is not as there's no suggestion that this part of the transaction should be treated out of context. Why are Royal Mail staff who get shares in the IPO forced to hold them for three years before a sale? Cable replies that there's a good reason to treat them differently - they're getting free shares. We've moved onto the issue of the free shares handed to Royal Mail staff -- \u00a32000 each. Cable says that after all the criticism from workers groups, only 371 opted out of the free share offer out of around 150,000. That suggest the float is very popular, he adds. Will staff surrender their shares if they leave before the three-year lock-in? Cable thinks not, but he'll check. Another question from Nils Pratley's list (number 1 this time). Did Lazards, the government's advisors, give their opinion on the pricing of Royal Mail shares? Cable says they did. And did they agree that should be priced at up to 330p? \"Indeed\", he adde. MPs remind Vince Cable that Panmure Gordon, the stockbrokers, reckon Royal Mail has been seriously undervalued. Cable says that he's comfortable that Panmure give a view, as \"they have a job to do\", but insists that they are an outlier by claiming Royal Mail could be worth over \u00a34bn. He's getting quite a grilling, with Katy Clark MP asking how we'll assess whether taxpayers got a good deal in a year's time: Cable's comment on ignoring 'froth' as Royal Mail shares settle at their true value didn't go down too well: Cable won't be drawn on the issue of whether the Royal Mail share price will spike when trading begins -- we need to 'totally ignore' the froth on the early days of trading. Vince Cable also suggests people may have been carried away by the talk that the Royal Mail is being undervalued. People are saying it's a cheap stock, he says. \"We don't know how it will turn out\". This isn't a widows and orphans fund. Cable also suggests that some people have been carried away with the idea that the Royal Mail IPO is a great deal. It's rather unwise that people have gone out....during the process saying it's a cheap stock and you should go and buy it. People need to be responsible, he adds. Why is the Royal Mail prospectus so big, at 440 pages? Won't it have put people off applying? Cable says that institutional investors would have been inspecting Royal Mail for some time, adding that it's a standard length document for an IPO of this type. An IPO for this sort isn't normal, an MP adds. Rebecca Harris, Conservative MP, asks Cable why the government set a minimum share allocation of \u00a3750 each for individual investors. Cable says that this was deemed sufficient to \"attract people of modest means\". He adds that this has worked \u2013 with 700,000 people applying at the last count. The flotation is around seven times oversubscribed, he adds. Retail investors will get 30% of Royal Mail shares allocated in the IPO, says Cable, with institutional investors getting 70%. Is Vince Cable really saying that the government will only allocate Royal Mail shares to institutional investors to those who you are satisfied will hold the shares for long-term benefits, not short term profits, the committee chairman asks. If so, how? Cable replies that the people managing the allocation will handle it, and are satisfied that they've had enough demand to make sure the right kind of institution get the shares. Rather than simply taking bids from the highest bidder -- hedge funds and the like. Cable adds: The aim is to place the shares with the long-term investors, the kind of people I've described. Question two comes straight out of Nils Pratley's list of questions for Vince Cable in today's Guardian! Question 4, in fact -- how can the government ensure a responsible share ownership for Royal Mail? Cable replies that if the floatation is oversubscribed (which is is), the government will be \"in a position\" to ensure that the shares go to responsible investore. We can ensure that we do get the right kind of investor community, Cable adds. We are trying to ensure a Royal Mail is owned by responsible longterm institutional investors. Vince Cable is up at the Business, Innovation and Skills committee to discuss the Royal Mail provatisation. First question, why is he allowing speculators to make a killing on the sale of a venerable institution, and paying big fees to City institutions? Especially given Cable's well-known opposition to speculators Cable says there's nothing 'short term' about floating Royal Mail. We are aiming to ensure a responsible, long-term investor base. He also claims that the fees being paid are competitive. Back to Washington briefly, where the IMF's Jose Vinals has just enthusiastically grabbed the opportunity to question the UK government's Help to Buy scheme (flags up Heather Stewart) Vinals said \"one needs to be vigilant,\" about the impact on households' and banks' balance sheets; and increasing housing supply to cool off high prices, \"may require measures beyond the programme we are discussing,\" such as alleviating planning constraints, and tax incentives to spur building. He continued: The question is, if the scheme we have increases the demand for housing but there is not a sufficient response on the supply for new housing, this may lead to even higher housing prices, which may actually reduce the affordability of housing to the population. Vince Cable's appearance to discuss the Royal Mail selloff will be streamed live here. My colleague Nils Pratley has already helped the Treasury Committee out, with a list of five questions Vince Cable must be asked this afternoon They are: 1 Do you think it would have been possible to sell the shares above the 330p maximum price in the advertised range? Given the requirement to achieve value for money for taxpayers, was this option assessed once the strength of demand from would-be buyers became clear? Was Lazards, adviser to the government, asked to give an opinion? If so, what did it say? 2 Why was the upper limit of the price range set at 330p in the first place? How was that figure established? 3 What premium above the IPO price \u2013 whether achieved after a day, a week or a month of trading \u2013 would you regard as evidence of under-pricing to the detriment of the public pursue? Would 10%, 15% or 20% qualify? 4 What did you mean when you said one consideration in the sale was \"ensuring that ownership of the Royal Mail moves smoothly to responsible investors able to take a long-term, responsible approach to owning the company?\" Have irresponsible investors been disqualified from applying for shares? If so, how? 5 About 30% of the shares on offer were initially ear-marked for private investors. Can this proportion now be increased if there is sufficient demand? Back in the UK, business secretary Vince Cable is due to give evidence on the Royal Mail privatisation at the Treasury committee shortly. Here's what's on the agenda: \u00b7 The valuation of Royal Mail, including whether or not it has been undervalued by the Government \u00b7 Details of the employee share scheme \u00b7 Protection of the universal service \u00b7 Value of Royal Mail assets, including Nine Elms in south London Here are three key graphs and chart from today's IMF Global Financial Stability Report. This shows how interest rates could spike if the Fed mishandles unwinding QE: And here's an explanation of how an asset fire sale would begin: You can read the IMF's Global Financial Stability Report online here (pdf). The key threat identified by the IMF in today's Global Financial Stability Report is that interest rates could rise sharply when the task of unwinding QE begins. The speed of the rise in borrowing costs, not the size of it, is crucial to whether the world economy is hit by a destabilising panic. Observer economics editor Heather Stewart explains: When the US Federal Reserve starts to phase out its $85bn-a-month quantitative easing programme it could spark a rapid rise in global interest rates and \u201cfire sales\u201d of assets across the world\u2019s financial markets, according to the International Monetary Fund. In the latest edition of its twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF said markets have become riskier over the past six months as investors have begun to adjust to the prospect of an end to QE in the US. Its analysts laid out a relatively benign scenario, in which market interest rates adjust gradually to a world without the flow of cheap money from the Fed. But they warned that there is also an \u201cadverse scenario\u201d, which would involve investors taking a $2.3tn hit amid \u201ca rapid tightening in financial conditions, potentially aggravated by reduced market liquidity and forced asset sales\u201d. The IMF describes the markets\u2019 so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d earlier this year, after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke mooted the idea of \u201ctapering\u201d QE, as a \u201cmini stress test\u201d, which helped to reveal how investors might respond as monetary policy returns to normal. Its adverse scenario involves the same increase in long-term interest rates \u2013 1 percentage point \u2013 as the benign scenario, but over a much shorter time-period. The IMF is also calling on Europe to crack on and implement banking union, before investors lose faith in the region's banks. In another key recommendation from the Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF said: Investors' faith in euro-area bank balance sheets must be restored ... and banking union completed. Otherwise, the euro area risks entering a lengthy, chronic phase of low growth and balance sheet strains. Banking union would mean a single agency with the power to rescue a struggling eurozone bank, or close a failing one. Over in Washington, the International Monetary Fund is warning that investors risks losing trillions of dollars if central bankers -- such as Janet Yellen -- mishandle the task of unwinding their emergency measures. In its latest Global Financial Stability Report, just released, the IMF estimate that losses could reach $2.3trn (\u00a31.44trn) if ending quantitative easing is mishandled. QE has left central bankers holding huge quantities of sovereign debt (the Bank of England has \u00a3375bn of UK gilts). The Fund reckons that, if investors are spooked by the unwinding process, interest rates on sovereign debt could spike rapidly by one percentage point, wiping $2.3trn off the value of bond portfolios. More to follow.... President Barack Obama is expected to formally announce Janet Yellen as his choice to succeed Ben Bernanke at 3pm East Coast time (or 8pm BST tonight). However, she must still be confirmed by the Senate. And as flagged up earlier, this may mean a rough ride on Capitol Hill - with Republicans in no mood to go easy on Yellen. FastFT have published a handy explainer. In short, Yellen needs to be approved by the 22-member Senate Banking Committee , and then a Senate vote. The Democrats control the Committee (with 12 seats) and have a majority in the Senate. So it's hard to see Yellen being stopped, but we may see some hardline Republican opposition, and much talk of the perils of money printing. More here: The nomination process Yellen needs to navigate Business Insider have an interesting take on Janet Yellen's appointment to Fed chief -- they've spoken to two high-school friends from Fort Hamilton High School, Brooklyn. They report that the world's most powerful central banker-in-waiting was clearly academically talented,adventuresome,\" and \"a classic '60s liberal\". Interested in a wide range of subjects, she quickly became hooked on economics at Brown University. Perhaps more alarmingly, she also edited the school newspaper. Journalism's loss, I fear.... More here: Janet Yellen's High School Friends Remember Her As Interested In Everything And Imperturbable Capital Economics reckons Janet Yellen is undoubtedly the best person to run the Federal Reserve, but fears she might wait too long before ending the era of loose monetary policy: They write: The outlook for monetary policy will be little changed when Janet Yellen replaces Ben Bernanke as Fed Chair at the end of January. At this stage, Yellen is unquestionably the best candidate. But there is a slightly bigger risk that under her stewardship, the Fed will fail to tighten monetary policy in time once the recovery gathers momentum, eventually triggering an unwanted surge in inflation. And here's the situation in Europe's stock markets, with most now up on the day. The FTSE 100 is still slightly in the red, though, having slipped to a three-month low yesterday. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says there's a \" fear-driven, risk-off mentality\" in the City. Back in the markets, Janet Yellen's imminent promotion to run the Federal Reserve continues to cheer investors. Wall Street is expected to open higher, while most European stock markets have gained ground despite those gnawing fears over the US debt ceiling standoff. As covered in our early round-up of analyst views, there's a broad consensus that Yellen won't be a radically change to Ben Bernanke. That means the punch bowl of easy monetary policy won't be swiftly swiped out of Wall Street's clutches. Seb Galy of SocGen writes: Yellen will be nominated today to be the chairman of the Fed and has the support of key Democrats for her senate confirmation. While the senate is the senior body, it doesn't necessarily mean the process will be smooth or fast. Being painted an ultra dova is not going to go down well with the tea party. For now, this nomination is boosting expectations of money printing. And Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, reckons choosing Yellen will bolster Obama's troops on Capitol Hill: Yellen was the preferred choice of Democrats in the Senate and House of Representatives and will help to unite the party in the face of the current opposition from the Republican Party.\u2028 \u2028The perception of leadership continuity and reinstating a \u201cdove\u201d as chairman will support equity markets and coax US consumers into believing all is well in America, meaning they continue to spend and cushion the economic impact of the government shutdown. She also questions whether Yellen is quite as much of a dove as painted: \u2028Although Yellen is perceived as the dovish nomination, monetary policy is not as black and white as dove and hawk. She has voted for rate hikes 20 times during her Fed career and is not so much a dove as an aggressive advocate of monetary policy. Yellen will maintain monetary easing when the economy is weak, but isn\u2019t afraid to tighten policy when the time comes. Yellen could be seen as a wise choice considering the markets adverse reaction to the prospect of a slowdown in QE. The Fed is in a hapless position, taper and the very recovery which had caused the policy move is at risk, but fail to taper and market bubbles continue to inflate, bringing the economy ever closer to a burst. The best advice is to proceed slowly and with caution and Yellen\u2019s will provide just that. The Office for Budget Responsibility's full report into its forecasting performance is online here: Forecast evaluation report \u2013 October 2013 This chart (on page 21) shows how the UK economy's performance (second graph) failed to meet the OBS's forecast (top graph). The difference was that firms spent far less on investment (the blue bit) than it expected: Ben Chu of the Independent also homed in on this point, suggesting firms' optimism may have been discouraged by the sight of austerity cutbacks: Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility has just briefed the press on its annual forecast evaluation -- in which it examines its performance at predicting the UK's economic performance. OBR chief Robert Chote blamed surprisingly weak business investment for inaccuracies in its forecasts, rather than the impact of austerity. Observer editor Heather Stewart was there, and tweeted the key points as she emerged blinking from the depths of the OBR. The cost of insuring America's debt against default has risen again this morning. The cost of buying a credit default swap to insuring a US bond for a year jumped by another 7 basis points to 60 basis points. That's the highest level since July 2011. It's also 22 basis points over the cost of buying protection for a five-year bond (usually the shorter-term protection is cheaper). This may indicate growing concern that the US could suffer a technical default (or alternatively, traders are scenting profits, calculating that CDS contracts will keep rising as Washington fails to agree a debt ceiling deal). The usual proviso applies -- US bonds are still being treated as extremely safe. Just less safe. In practice, a 60bp CDS means it costs you $60,000 to insure $10m of US bonds for a year. Been wondering why the Spanish banking sector hasn't blown up yet? London fund manager @pawelmorski has taken a look, in a new blogpost (not before time either). In it, Morski argues that Spain's bankers have done a somewhat better job then we expected a year or so ago. Despite the extensive property boom, and ear-popping plunge, the amount of aid handed to Spain to recapitalise its banks is only around 5% of GDP (so far....). More may be coming, but if so, where will the losses appear?.... He also riffs entertainingly on the hubris that created such a mess over in Ireland. Here's a flavour: The parallels between Spain and Ireland in macro terms are pretty exact, but Spain\u2019s bankers appear to have escaped the very worst of the sheer, jaw-dropping imbecility of their Irish counterparts. For my money, Anglo Republic is actually one of the very best books about the whole global crisis because it\u2019s a wonderful and highly entertaining (the bank spent \u20ac200,000 on corporate golfballs) take on just how a little success can drive people, but especially bankers, insane with greed and hubris. Clearly the Cajas especially were awful banks, but Spanish losses are not in the Irish stratosphere. Not all bubbles are created equal \u2013 and the EU can give thanks that its largest troubled economy appears to be its Korea rather than its Indonesia. The UK might also usefully reflect on how the main difference between the UK and Ireland was that sterling prevented an Irish-style property meltdown. Plenty of evidence that the Scottish banks were as rotten as their Irish counterparts. More here: Europe: Saved By The Genius Of Spanish Bankers With a week to go until its next budget, there are encouraging signs for Ireland's economy this morning. After years of damaging austerity, one of the Republic's most respected economic think tanks reckons its economy will grow by 2% this year From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: The Economic and Social Research Institute of Ireland also predicts today that growth will shoot up to 2.7% in 2014. The ESRI also believe that the country's budget deficit will come in lower next year than the 5.1 per cent of GDP imposed by the IMF, the European Central Bank and the EU in the bail out-rescue programme. This may make it easier for Ireland to exit the bailout in 2014 and restore full economic sovereignty. This upbeat assessment of the economy comes as the Fine Gael-Labour coalition finalise plans for next week's 2014 budget. In a bid to soften up the public before budget day, further leaks of what it contains include some good news for the country's police force and pensioners. The freeze of Garda recruitment will be lifted and new officers brought in while there will no cuts to old age pensions in the budget. While Labour minister Joan Burton is under pressure to deliver tens of milions of cuts in the social welfare budget there is speculation that the projected \u20ac440m of cuts may be lower than that figure. Clearly the overall message Enda Kenny's government is trying to transmit after its surprising defeat in last Friday's referendum vote on the future of Ireland's second parliamentary chamber, is that this will be the least harshest budget over the last half decade and may signal that the economy is turning around. But as this piece published by Bloomberg yesterday showed, the Irish economy has been badly hurt by the years of austerity since its bank sector blew up: Steak No More in Yeats Country Amid Scant Irish Recovery The UK government's controversial Help To Buy scheme may or may not do much for first-time buyers, but it's certainly cheering shareholders in UK housebuilders today. Shares in Persimmon have jumped over 4%, while Barratt, Taylor Wimpey and Bellway are all up over 3%, on expectations that the programme (of subsidised loans and insurance guarantees) will help drive their profits. Goldman Sachs sees better times ahead -- upgrading the sector this morning, as my colleague Nick Fletcher reports: Housebuilders lifted by Help to Buy and positive Goldman note City analysts say the surprise drop in UK factory output shows we shouldn't get carried away by the International Monetary Fund upgrading its view of the British economy yesterday. It's also worth noting that recent PMI surveys (in which Markit ask company managers how conditions look) have been rather more upbeat. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, suggests bosses may have got carried away with the good news: Industrial production has tumbled with big falls in food manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and electronic goods in August, showing a further sign that the UK\u2019s economic revival cannot be guaranteed. While the IMF may have sung the UK\u2019s praises yesterday, today\u2019s number shows that the broad based recovery that so many have been hailing has significant tasks attached. The divergence between the recent, multiyear highs on PMIs and the official data is worrying and a little difficult to explain. Could businesses be overly exuberant without cause? Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight calls the fall in industrial production and rising trade deficit a \" double dose of disappointing news\" on the UK economy: While this could be seen as somewhat of a reality check on the UK economy, not too much should be read into the marked drop in industrial output (especially) and wide trade deficit in August, it does put a dent into hopes that the economy may have grown by as much as 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. For now, we are sticking to our view that the economy grew by around 0.8% quarter-on-quarter. This graph shows how UK manufacturing output shrank unexpectedly in August: Britain's economy may not be as healthy as thought. The pound has taken a nasty tumble after new economic data showed a surprise drop in industrial output across Britain's factories in August. The Office for National Statistics reported a drop in output across the manufacturing sector, from pharmaceutical firm to makers of computers, electronic &amp; optical products; and food products, beverages &amp; tobacco goods. Output tumbled by 1.1% month-on month, which is the worst drop since September 2012. Economists had pencilled in a 0.4% rise in output, as Britain's economic recovery picked up pace. And in another blow, the UK trade deficit was bigger than expected in August -- at \u00a39.625bn, compared with forecasts of \u00a39bn. Sterling promptly dropped more than half a cent against the US dollar, from $1.6035 to $1.5975. More to follow.... In City news this morning, baking chain Greggs has reined in its expansion plans and returned to sales growth, after a tricky few months in which it posted two profit warnings due to hot weather, cold weather, and \"promiscuous shoppers\". Greggs slows sales decline as it battles to win back customers And Marston's, the pub chain, is celebrating the recent warm weather -- which drove more drinkers (and eaters) to its \"destination\" and \"premium\" pubs. Like-for-like sales are up 2.9% in the last 11 weeks. Plenty of reaction to Janet Yellen's appointment on Twitter too: Janet Yellen's appointment as Fed chief has pleased Barack Obama's Democrats, such as Tim Johnson from South Dakota who said: I commend President Obama on his selection of Dr. Yellen to be the first woman to serve as Federal Reserve Chairman. She has a depth of experience that is second to none, and I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve Chairman. In addition to having more than a decade\u2019s worth of experience working on monetary policy at the Federal Reserve, Dr. Yellen has also worked at the White House as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors and taught at some of world\u2019s most prestigious universities. I will work with Ranking Member [Mike] Crapo and the rest of the members of the Banking Committee to move her nomination forward in a timely manner. But with the parties at war on Capitol Hill, Republicans are unlikely to roll out a red carpet for Yellen. Here's Tennessee senator Bob Corker: I voted against Vice Chairman Yellen's original nomination to the Fed in 2010 because of her dovish views on monetary policy. We will closely examine her record since that time, but I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed. The news that Janet Yellen will become America's next central bank chief has attracted a lot of comment in the financial world. Analysts believe her appointment will ensure continuity at the Federal Reserve, meaning a strong focus on unemployment and no sudden change to its bond-buying programme: Here's a selection (partly from Reuters) Diane Garnick of Clear Alternatives: With the Federal Reserve facing one of the most important periods in history, Janet Yellen is a great choice. Her experience with the Council of Economic Advisors coupled with her academic prowess make her an optimal choice to guide the US economy through a period of rising rates. Many Americans remain concerned over the continuing high unemployment rate. Yellen's focus on the labor market could bring a much needed relief as tapering this year becomes rising rates in the ensuing years. Dan Fuss of Loomis Sayles: Thank God Yellen will be nominated under the current circumstances. You don't want a change at the central bank right now. And when it comes to qualifications, Janet Yellen is an outstanding person for the post. My guess is this is a good thing for the US Treasury market. The markets were acting very sick today. People were going on the sidelines, so this Yellen news is one uncertainty lifted from already nervous markets.\" Stan Shamu of IG: Reports of Janet Yellen\u2019s nomination saw the US dollar lose ground to risk currencies like the Australian dollar, the euro, and the pound. While Janet Yellen\u2019s nomination was already mostly priced into the market, it certainly does momentarily take the investment community\u2019s mind off the government shutdown. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities: While the debacle on Capitol Hill will remain up front and central to markets, there is the added bonus of digesting Yellen's nomination as the next Fed Chairman ('are you really sure that you want this poisoned chalice, Janet?' Ed.) Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac in Sydney: Markets are giving Yellen the thumbs up, counting on QE being maintained at full pace until further notice. It's a notable reaction given Yellen's nomination was so widely expected and that it comes at a time markets are already assuming the FOMC will not seriously consider a policy change at the October meeting given the fiscal standoff. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, News that Obama is set to nominate the dovish vice Chair Janet Yellen to the top job at the Fed (and in global central banking) has seen sentiment improve, on prospect of policy continuity - rates staying low for long and policy accommodative - but US political gridlock still dominant as well as the IMF cutting global growth forecasts and warning the US. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: Last night\u2019s comments by President Obama that \u201cthere is no magic bullet\u201d to resolve the budget showdown saw the biggest one day slide in the US markets for 11 months. Markets did stabilise on the news that Ben Bernanke\u2019s deputy Janet Yellen would be confirmed as his replacement as Fed chairman when he steps down in January. This choice of monetary policy dove makes it much more likely that the Fed will continue to remain accommodative into next year, though even sure won\u2019t be able to apply a band aid if Congress continues along its self-destructive path. Shares are falling again in the City, with the FTSE 100 dropping another 20-odd points in early trading. The news of Janet Yellen's appointment to the Fed is probably limiting further losses. FTSE 100: down 22 points at 6343, - 0.34% German DAX: down 13 points at 8542, -0.16% French CAC: down 9 points at 4123, - 0.24% Spanish IBEX: up 15 points at 9333, +0.17% Italian FTSE MIB: up 54 points at 18,438, +0.36% If you missed the action in Washington last night, here's our latest story by Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts: Barack Obama has warned of immediate damage to US creditworthiness if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling \u2013 even if the Treasury can find funds to avoid triggering a technical default in the bond market. With billions of dollars of payments to social security, recipients and lenders competing for possible attention if such a crisis were to occur, the president shot down new suggestions among Republicans that the administration could prioritise payments to avoid lasting damage. Dubbed the 'pay China first' strategy by some Democrat critics, the argument growing in Congress is that October 17 is not the hard and fast deadline portrayed by the White House because the US has a choice over which bills to pay first and can avoid missing market-sensitive payments. But the notion was rejected by the president on Tuesday, who told reporters that skipping any payments would alarm markets to such an extent that the cost of borrowing for the US government was bound to go up anyway. \u201cWhat I am told is: if the markets are seeing that we are not paying our bills on time, that will affect our creditworthiness \u2013 even if bondholders are paid on time,\u201d said Obama. Obama issues fresh debt limit warning to Republicans as stalemate drags on Janet Yellen will become arguably the most important person in the global financial world when she replaces Ben Bernanke as head of the Federal Reserve. She'll also be taking over at a crucial time, with the Fed pondering when to slow its huge stimulus programme (it's currently buying $85bn of US government debt and mortgage-backed bonds with newly created money each month). Our Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe writes: Yellen has been seen as one of Bernanke\u2019s key allies in the QE programme, which has split the Fed board with other members increasingly concerned about the impact of the massive bond-buying programme. Yellen\u2019s appointment also comes as Congress argues over raising the US debt ceiling. Bernanke has consistently warned that failure to raise the US borrowing limit would have a severely negative impact on the country\u2019s still-fragile economic recovery. The 67-year-old economist and Brooklyn native was appointed vice-chair of the Fed in October 2010. Previously she was president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and also served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisors from 1997 to 1999. An expert on the job markets, Yellen has been a staunch ally of Bernanke as he has tried to use low interest rates and the QE programme to reanimate the US\u2019s still lackluster job market. Here's Dom's full story on Yellen's appointment: Obama to nominate Janet Yellen as head of US Federal Reserve Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. America is dominating attention this morning, with the news overnight that Janet Yellen is going to be nominated today to replace Ben Bernanke as head of the Federal Reserve. Yellen, currently Fed vice-chair, is a popular choice with many economists and investors. Her fans hail her forecasting record, and say her dovish views -- more focused on unemployment levels than inflation rates - \u2013 are ideal for managing US monetary policy. A formal announcement is expected tonight (at 8pm BST or 3pm Eastern Time). News of Yellen's selection, which broke last night, has brought some relief to markets whose patience with the US government shutdown is running thin. Last night, President Barack Obama warned there was no \"magic bullet\" to fixing the deadlock in Washington. At a testy, lengthy, press conference he said he would only negotiate budget issues with Republicans if they agree to re-open the federal government and raise the debt limit with no conditions attached. House speaker John Boehner also refused to back down, saying politicians need to confront America's steadily rising debts before he'll agree to raise the debt ceiling. This sent the Dow Jones sliding on Wall Street last night, and there's little hope of a Yellen rally in Europe today. The US government runs out of borrowing headroom in under nine days time, and investors are now getting more edgy about what happens at one minute to midnight on October 17th. Also coming up today.... a splurge of UK economic data at 9.30am (including trade and industrial production), Mario Draghi is giving a speech, Vince Cable is appearing at the Treasury committee to discuss the Royal Mail flotation, and the International Monetary Fund will release more details of its latest assessment of the World Economy.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has handed the City regulator messages sent by one of its former traders in the latest twist in an investigation into potential manipulation of currency rates. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) began an investigation into the \u00a33tn-a-day foreign exchange market in June following allegations that traders at major banks had found ways to manipulate a closely followed currency benchmark. Swiss regulators have also begun to scrutinise the foreign exchange markets, regarded as among the most liquid in the world, sparking speculation that a number of major banks are facing questions about the way they traded leading currencies. \"It's a fact that foreign exchange manipulation was committed,\" Swiss finance minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said. The investigations are the latest attempts to clamp down on potential abuses of financial benchmarks, first highlighted by the Libor rigging scandal in June 2012 when Barclays was fined \u00a3290m for manipulating the key interest rate. RBS has also been fined for Libor rigging, as has Swiss bank UBS and more recently the broking firm Icap run by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer.

It is a word that has dominated her years at the helm of the eurozone crisis. She has heard it a lot. She does not like it. But the spending cuts, \"structural reforms\", slashed budgets, decimated public services and wrenching social and cultural upheavals imposed on Europe's fringes over the past four years to save the euro are a result of the austerity that has been the \"made in Germany\" policy response to the troubles. Merkel and her fellow leaders in northern Europe and in Brussels are already mildly sanguine that they have weathered the worst of the euro-storm. The markets are calm. The banks, whose irresponsible lending spree did much to produce the crisis in the first place, are raking in squillions, the bulk of the hundreds of billions in bailout funds lent by the eurozone since 2010. Crisis over? Not in the real economy, where it may just really be beginning. According to the detailed study being released on Thursday by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies: \"The long-term consequences of this crisis have yet to surface. The problems caused will be felt for decades \u2026 The economic crisis is creating the conditions for a widespread social crisis, whereby a growing gap in the distribution of resources (the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer) and the competition for shrinking resources could bring about growing xenophobia, discrimination, social exclusion, as well as abuse and domestic problems.\" The narrative of the crisis has been one of state bankruptcy and bailouts, of bond yields and spreads, of borrowing costs and debt sustainability, of faceless men in suits from the \"troika\" of international technocrats taking over the accounts, budgets and policies of elected governments and administering the austerity medicine. On the evidence of the Red Cross study, it might be working in the markets but not in real life. A huge proportion of Europe's young have no hope of finding a job; the middle classes are being reduced to benefit claimants; young couples are moving back in with their parents and grandparents; the soup kitchen queues are lengthening; the children of the poor are going without medicines as free health services are scrapped. \"Europe has a long record of maintaining a plausible trust in the future of its young people, even during turmoil. Not anymore,\" the study found. The European model, the social market economy or welfarist capitalism, is being radically changed as a result of the crisis and because of the policy prescriptions mainly ordered in Berlin and administered from Brussels. The German argument is that it needs radical reform in order to survive. On the evidence of the Red Cross findings, the question is whether the medicine is curing or killing. Merkel's real concern is less about safeguarding the European model than reviving European and German competitiveness in the global race for market shares. Germany's doing well but Berlin fears it will be dragged down by French or Italian feebleness, and that the austerity and the structural changes to labour markets, pension systems or health services need to be imposed to get Europe fit for future competition. The policies are exacting a very high price. The social, political, and psychological distress is growing. From fascist murders on the streets of Athens to a shrinking middle class in Germany itself, to places like Latvia, where the word doctor has almost become a term of abuse, Merkel's Europe is becoming a colder place.",

What recovery there has been since 2010 has been dominated by a jump in private consumption. The OBR's director, Robert Chote, suggested several reasons for weaker-than-expected private investment growth, including sub-par profits, and uncertainty about government policy. Lack of a recovery in business investment, which fell by 8.5% over the past year according to the latest official figures, has not just stymied forecasters, but alarmed analysts hoping for a rebalancing of the economy away from consumption, towards a Britain that can \"pay its way in the world,\" as George Osborne has put it. However, the unfavourable balance of the recovery has been better news for the Treasury's coffers, since consumer spending is likely to be taxed more heavily \u2013 through VAT, for example \u2013 than business investment, which can be offset against tax. Chote said that helped to explain why despite the OBR's 2010 forecasts being over-optimistic on the likely pace of the recovery, the deficit had come in almost as expected. The OBR director also repeated his assessment from last year, that its forecasts had not been blown off course by a larger-than-expected hit to growth from the government's deficit-cutting strategy.

    "webTitle": "IMF: Federal Reserve QE tapering could spark global rate rises", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has underlined the scale of the challenge facing Janet Yellen if she is confirmed as Federal Reserve chairman by issuing a stark warning on Wednesday that phasing out quantitative easing could spark \"fire sales\" of assets, wiping $2.3tn off bond markets. In the latest edition of its twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Report (pdf), the IMF said markets had become riskier over the past six months as investors began to adjust to the prospect of the withdrawal of the Fed's $85bn-a-month programme. Under its \"adverse scenario\", the fund warned, global interest rates would jump abruptly, causing turmoil across world financial markets. Yellen is widely seen as a monetary-policy \"dove\" who will be reluctant to rush into turning off QE, and her appointment cheered markets, which have thrived on the flow of cheap funds from the central bank's bond-buying spree. But the Fed has clearly signalled its intention to scale back the pace of its asset purchase programme once unemployment falls below 7%. The IMF regards the phasing out of QE as a positive development, reflecting the growing US recovery, but the report warns that \"managing a smooth transition could prove challenging, as investors adjust portfolios for a new regime with higher interest rates and greater volatility\". Presenting the report in Washington on Wednesday, Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, the IMF's director of monetary and capital markets, welcomed Yellen's likely appointment, saying, \"I cannot think of anybody who's better placed than Janet Yellen to lead the Fed in these challenging times\". In the report, IMF analysts lay out a relatively benign scenario in which market rates adjust gradually as the Fed withdraws its stimulus. But they warn that there is also an adverse scenario, which would involve investors taking a $2.3tn (\u00a31.4tn) hit amid \"a rapid tightening in financial conditions, potentially aggravated by reduced market liquidity and forced asset sales\". The IMF described the markets' so-called \"taper tantrum\" earlier this year, after Fed chairman Ben Bernanke mooted the idea of tapering QE, as a \"mini stress test\" that helped to reveal how investors might respond as monetary policy returns to normal. Its adverse scenario involves the same increase in long-term interest rates \u2013 one percentage point \u2013 as the benign scenario, but over a much shorter time period. Because investors have flooded into bond markets and longer-term assets since QE got under way, the losses to investors would be far larger than during other recent episodes when policymakers have been pushing up interest rates. Losses have averaged $664bn over the past three tightening cycles. Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England's executive director for markets, recently warned that central banks had inflated \"the biggest bond bubble in history\", which could jeopardise l stability if it burst. The IMF highlighted the fact that some parts of the less-regulated shadow banking sector, such as mortgage real estate investment trusts, are particularly vulnerable, because they are heavily reliant on short-term borrowing from the so-called repo markets, which can dry up in times of financial stress. \"Short-term secured funding markets are still exposed to potential runs that a rising-rate, higher-volatility environment may reveal,\" the report said. Vi\u00f1als pointed out that capital flows to emerging markets have increased by $1tn since the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008 \u2013 $500bn more than previous trends would have suggested. As the flow of cheap money is turned off, which could prompt many investors to pull their capital back home, he suggested policymakers may have to intervene in foreign exchange markets \"in order to maintain orderly conditions\". The IMF also remains concerned about the risks to financial stability in the eurozone, where many companies are still carrying heavy debt burdens. \"In the stressed economies of Italy, Portugal and Spain, heavy corporate sector debt loads and financial fragmentation remain challenging,\" the report says. Help to Buy warning The IMF's Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als has reiterated the fund's scepticism about the UK government's Help to Buy scheme. \"The question is, if the scheme we have increases the demand for housing but there is not a sufficient response on the supply for new housing, this may lead to even higher housing prices, which may actually reduce the affordability of housing to the population,\" he said, warning \"one needs to be vigilant\" about the impact on households and on banks' balance sheets. The latest part of the scheme, launched this week, is intended to underwrite \u00a3130bn of mortgage lending on deposits as low as 5%. But Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, dismissed concerns it will inflate a housing bubble, saying critics ignore areas of the country where house prices are not rising fast.",

Meanwhile Goldman raised its earnings forecasts for the UK housing stocks to 26% above concensus and said it expected a recovery to come by 2016 rather than its previous estimate of 2020. It said: Partly stimulated by the Help To Buy shared equity scheme, lead indicators such as UK mortgage approvals and RICS survey data strongly indicate a rebound in activity. Moreover, forward sales for UK housebuilders are currently tracking up around 50%, further supporting our view of a meaningful transactions recovery from 2014 onwards from depressed levels. We accelerate our view of UK housing market recovery, increasing our view of transaction growth to 15% per annum (2014-2016) from 10%/10%/6%, and house price inflation to 6% per annum from 4% per annum over the same period. It added Taylor Wimpey to its conviction buy list and upgraded Bovis and Barratt from neutral to buy. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 18.01 points at 6347.82 as the worries about the US debt crisis were somewhat assuaged by news that President Obama was to nominate the dovish Janet Yellen as the successor to Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve chairman. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: The US political fiscal standoff is trumping even news of continuity at the Fed with Obama nominating dovish vice-chair Yellen for the hot seat, likely meaning rates lower, and tapering held back, for longer. [Tuesday's] IMF growth forecast cuts are also adding to gloom, even if Alcoa kicked off the US third quarter earnings season on the front foot. Vedanta Resources is leading the fallers, down 37p to \u00a310.33 despite an in line production update, as Morgan Stanley moved from equal weight to underweight.",

But this represented a better result than the 2.1% decline in like-for-like sales for the year so far. Greggs' chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said he was encouraged by the improvement in performance. Whiteside, who was drafted in from Punch Taverns in February, has embarked on a turnaround plan to brighten up the bakeries and broaden the range with a move into new products, such as pizza. \"We are encouraged by the recent improvement in like-for-like performance, although with consumer disposable incomes still under pressure we remain cautious,\" he said. \"Cost inflation is in line with our expectations and the group's cash position remains strong. Our overall outlook for the full year is unchanged.\" Greggs has abandoned plans to increase its total number of stores: in the latest quarter it closed almost as many stores as it opened, with 20 new shops appearing and 17 being shut down. The company said it expected to refit 215 shops by the end of the year, around 12% of its entire estate of 1,700 bakeries. The company has issued two profit warnings this year, the most recent in August, and at various times has attributed its problems to cold weather, hot weather, tough conditions on the high street and \"promiscuous shoppers\".

Ginia's lawyers dismissed her siblings\u2019 objections to their mother\u2019s proposal, saying they had no reason other than that it was \"unappealing\". \"It's difficult to see how any genuine objections could be raised,\" her lawyers told the court. Ginia\u2019s lawyers argued it would take control of the trust out of the hands of warring siblings to appoint a \"genuinely independent\" trustee. Hancock and Bianca's lawyer said the pair could not possibly agree to appointing an independent trustee when they had \"no idea\" who it would be. Mining magnate Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest was drawn into the family feud on Tuesday when it was revealed in court he had filed an affidavit supporting the appointment of Hancock as trustee. The hearing continues.",
