The items will then be refurbished and sold on, or recycled for parts. UK householders are estimated to have around \u00a31bn worth of electrical and electronic equipment in their homes which is no longer used, and two-thirds of those surveyed by Wrap said they would be willing to trade in their tech products with a reputable retailer.

      "bodyText": "Small-business leaders have called for an alternative to Operation Stack \u2013 the system for letting lorries queue on the M20 in Kent when cross-Channel traffic is disrupted \u2013 saying it is hurting the economy. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) appealed to the government as Kent police kept the coastbound M20 closed between junctions 8 and 9 to accommodate lorries delayed by disruption caused by migrants trying to enter the Channel tunnel from France. The FSB said Stack, which occupies varying amounts of one or both carriageways, depending on the volume of queuing traffic, had now been in force for five of the past six weeks, amid strikes by French workers and incursions from migrants seeking to reach Britain. John Allan, the FSB\u2019s chairman, said the disruption from Stack had seen meetings cancelled, deliveries hampered, and staff delayed going to and from work. \u201cBusinesses have run out of patience, with the sense of exasperation and the strength of feeling among small firms at an all-time high,\u201d he said. \u201cWe appreciate that not all events, such as strike action in France, are within the government\u2019s direct control. But these extreme traffic delays have been a persistent issue for some years with little progress at either local or national level to deliver a fit-for-purpose, permanent solution.\u201d The organisation, which has about 200,000 members, has written to the government seeking a more permanent solution for what to do about freight traffic amid such disruption. Operation Stack, it said, began as a temporary solution in 1988. \u201cIt is simply unacceptable that a workable solution has not been planned and implemented in the intervening years,\u201d the group said in a statement. The FSB said it did not propose a particular solution to the issue but would be happy to liaise with ministers to find one. In the meantime, the group is backing plans by Highways England to introduce a contraflow system, allowing traffic to stay moving in both directions on the M20, even when Stack is in place. Allan said: \u201cIn the longer term, we simply cannot afford or allow such a major piece of our transport infrastructure to be continually disrupted for long periods of time.\u201d The FSB\u2019s comments came as Eurotunnel services returned to normal after long delays left British holidaymakers seething on one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. The Channel tunnel operator apologised to passengers on Saturday after thousands waited for up to five hours when migrants disrupted services in Calais. The company said it has cleared all of its backlog and that services from both the English and French sides are now running normally, with up to four departures an hour. John Keefe, a spokesman for Eurotunnel, said \u201cmigrant activity\u201d on Saturday night was minimal because of less freight traffic travelling from France \u2013 allowing services to return to normal. Speaking on Sunday, he said: \u201cEverything is going fine. Our services are running normally and to time, so we are getting through the traffic. We had delays yesterday morning, but managed to get all the traffic away despite the migrant activity in France. \u201cNow we have got no problems and our services are running well. We found a way of managing the migrant crisis and have got all the holiday traffic away on time for the beginning of the holidays.\u201d Keefe said Eurotunnel has spent \u20ac150m (\u00a3106m) since 2000 on security, an average of \u20ac10m (\u00a37m) a year. But the company has already spent \u20ac13m (\u00a39.2m) on security in the first six months of this year, he added.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest snapshot of economic growth this week will heat up the debate about when the Bank of England will raise UK interest rates for the first time since the depths of financial crisis. Economists predict official figures on Tuesday will show GDP growth bounced back in the second quarter after a new-year slowdown. Alongside fading worries about the Greek debt crisis and signs of rising living standards, any such recovery in headline growth could fan expectations that the Bank\u2019s policymakers are readying to raise interest rates, perhaps even before the end of the year. The data is expected to show the economy expanded by 0.7% between April and June, according to the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll. That would be close to the pace of growth at the end of last year and markedly higher than first-quarter growth of 0.4%. The GDP estimate from the Office for National Statistics will garner even more attention than usual given recent comments by the Bank governor, Mark Carney, that a hike in borrowing costs may be \u201cmoving closer\u201d after more than six years of record low interest rates at 0.5%. James Knightley, senior economist at ING, is expecting a strong rebound from the sluggish opening months of 2015. \u201cWe forecast 0.7%, which is above trend and is likely to keep the relatively hawkish rhetoric coming out of the Bank of England,\u201d he said. Recent business surveys have suggested household spending remains the main engine of growth despite the government\u2019s long-standing vow to rebalance the economy towards more manufacturing and exports. A rise in sterling against other big currencies has made UK goods more expensive overseas and has led a drop in exports, according to manufacturers. Chris Hare, economist at Investec, expects that to be reflected in the latest GDP figures with manufacturing and the construction sector shrinking in the second quarter. But oil and gas production were likely to have joined the services sector in helping push up growth. \u201cServices output should do most of the legwork,\u201d said Hare. \u201cThe GDP print is likely to point to a two speed economy, with services buoyed by solid domestic demand, while manufacturers suffer from the strong pound.\u201d Economists are divided over the extent to which households can continue to power the recovery, especially with another round of government cuts on the way. One consumer survey released on Monday signals UK positivity about job prospects and personal finances are both at their highest levels since before 2008 financial crisis. Market research company Nielsen said its measure of consumer confidence was up for the sixth successive quarter. \u201cConsumers in the UK are feeling ever more confident. Wage inflation is starting to outstrip price inflation for the first time in years, while mortgage rates are at historically low levels and unemployment has generally been falling,\u201d said Nielsen\u2019s UK &amp; Ireland managing director, Steve Smith. But other indicators have painted a gloomier picture. Last month there was a surprise drop in retail sales, despite falling prices, and the latest unemployment figures showed the jobless rate rising for the first time in two years. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has warned raising rates too soon could derail the recovery and last week he reiterated his worries. \u201cFor me, the combination of a still-healing economy, very low price pressures and a wobbly world means that there is no rush to move rates from where they are right now,\u201d he told BBC\u2019s Newsnight recently. The outlook for consumer spending has been cast into further doubt by chancellor George Osborne\u2019s plans for another round of spending cuts unveiled last week. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly some evidence that consumers may be starting to feel a little more nervous about their financial situation,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial information company Markit, whose latest household finances survey flagged up a number of worries among Britons. So while there are expectations that one or more of the Bank\u2019s nine rate-setters may start voting for a rise as soon as next week\u2019s meeting, their colleagues are likely take longer to be convinced. The earliest point analysts expect an interest rate hike is the turn of the year and financial markets are pricing in a move around February. Beyond that, rates look likely to climb only slowly. \u201cThe tightening of monetary policy is likely to be very gradual given the need to offset the severity of the fiscal squeeze,\u201d said Andrew Goodwin, UK economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics.",

Last month there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/23/uk-retail-sales-fall-despite-drop-in-prices\">a surprise drop in retail sales</a>, despite falling prices, and the latest unemployment figures showed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/15/britains-average-pay-rises-but-so-does-unemployment\">the jobless rate rising for the first time in two years</a>.</p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/interest-rates-rise-could-derail-recovery-bank-of-england-economist-warns\">warned raising rates too soon could derail the recovery</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/25/shareholders-receive-too-much-money-from-business-says-chief-economist\">last week he reiterated his worries</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, the combination of a still-healing economy, very low price pressures and a wobbly world means that there is no rush to move rates from where they are right now,\u201d he told BBC\u2019s Newsnight recently.<br></p> <p>The outlook for consumer spending has been cast into further doubt by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/21/spending-review-george-osborne-20bn-savings-clear-deficit\">chancellor George Osborne\u2019s plans for another round of spending cuts unveiled last week</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s certainly some evidence that consumers may be starting to feel a little more nervous about their financial situation,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial information company Markit, whose latest <a href=\"http://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/PressRelease.mvc/59ae717470a24098ad36ac8913e725ee\">household finances survey</a> flagged up a number of worries among Britons.<br></p> <p>So while there are expectations that one or more of the Bank\u2019s nine rate-setters may start voting for a rise as soon as next week\u2019s meeting, their colleagues are likely take longer to be convinced. The earliest point analysts expect an interest rate hike is the turn of the year and financial markets are pricing in a move around February. Beyond that, rates look likely to climb only slowly.</p> <p>\u201cThe tightening of monetary policy is likely to be very gradual given the need to offset the severity of the fiscal squeeze,\u201d said Andrew Goodwin, UK economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics.<br></p>",

Shell is also to reports its figures this week as is Centrica, which will unveil a small fall in group interim earnings, but a large increase in the profits from its British Gas domestic supply subsidiary.

At BP, underlying profits are expected to have fallen to $1.6bn over the latest three months compared with $3.6bn during the same period of 2014 and $2.6bn during the first quarter of 2015. Bob Dudley, its chief executive, will say that earlier moves to trim exploration spending and sell off assets has left BP better placed than many to weather a storm which has hit the entire industry.

Centrica, a North Sea operator but also a big six domestic energy supplier through its British Gas, is also expected to report a small fall in profits but a big shakeup.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Time to look at national insurance, the ultimate stealth tax", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyd George introduced it. Labour made it the bedrock of its post-war state pension scheme. Nigel Lawson toyed with the idea of abolishing it only to go cool on the idea. What is it? It is national insurance, the little brother to income tax and now the subject of a new review commissioned by George Osborne. National insurance contributions are the ultimate stealth tax. They raise a lot of money for the exchequer while being far less politically charged. Osborne expects to net \u00a3115bn from NICs in the current financial year, almost the same as from VAT and around two-thirds of what he will get from income tax (\u00a3170bn). But whereas no chancellor since Denis Healey in the 1970s has dared raise the basic rate of income tax, when Gordon Brown wanted to raise serious amounts of cash in order to fund higher health spending in 2002 it was to NICs that he turned. There was a reason for this: NICs are less visible and can be raised without nearly so much political grief. The public believes that NICs are somehow ring-fenced, that the money paid by employees and employers goes into a fund that pays for the NHS and for pensions. This, though, has not been the case for a very long time. As the review of the tax system conducted by the nobel prize winner Sir James Mirrlees noted: \u201cNational Insurance is not a true social insurance scheme; it is just another tax on earnings, and the current scheme invites politicians to play games with NICs without acknowledging that these are essentially part of the taxation of labour income. The two systems need to be merged.\u201d Let\u2019s be clear. Osborne is not proposing the immediate merging of NICs and income tax. Instead, he has asked the Office of Tax Simplification (OTS), to see whether the two could remain separate but be better aligned. This is undoubtedly a more cautious approach to reform, but in the long term it could reach the same conclusion: full merger. Despite the considerable difficulties involved, this would be welcome. It is not hard to see why the chancellor is adopting a softly-softly approach. Income tax is based on yearly earnings, NICs on weekly earnings. Pensioners do not pay NICs, and nor do the under 16s. They are collected using separate computer systems, and the recent problems with government IT projects does not exactly inspire confidence that the two could be merged with ease. There are also concerns, especially on the left, that merging tax and NICs would mean the link between contributions and benefits would be severed once and for all. Once people no longer thought they were personally benefitting from the contributions they had made over the years, it would - so the argument goes - make it easier for a tax-cutting party to shrink the size of the state. Finally, there would be losers as well as winners from any change, and the likeliest losers would be pensioners, who also happen to be the segment of the population most likely to vote. All these are important concerns. It is also not hard to see why Osborne wants the OTS to have another look at this issue. Businesses, particularly small businesses, find the tax system complex and expensive to administer. They would make considerable savings from a single earnings tax and that would translate into higher profits and more jobs. John Whiting, director of the OTS says that his organisation\u2019s polls of business have highlighted concerns about the complexity of the system. What\u2019s more, Osborne\u2019s political narrative for this parliament is that the Conservatives are the party of working people. The rise in the minimum wage (the so-called \u2018national living wage\u2019) and the increase in the personal allowance in the budget were designed to drive home this point. The impact of these changes was blunted by the decision to make tax credits less generous, a move that will take money away from the working families the chancellor says he wants to support. But a decision to merge tax and NICs would provide a fresh opportunity to drive home his political point. A full merger of income tax and national insurance would involve raising the threshold at which employees start paying NICs (currently \u00a38,060 a year for someone who works full time for a year) to the personal income tax allowance (currently \u00a310,600). This would mean those on low incomes paying less tax and getting the full benefit of Osborne\u2019s plan to raise the personal allowance to \u00a312,500 by the end of the parliament. The gap between the starting point for paying NICs and paying income tax has widened in recent years, because Osborne has used his budgets to deliver above-inflation increases in the personal allowance. Assuming that the chancellor wanted to make merger revenue neutral, the main beneficiaries would be younger workers on lower incomes, who would gain at the expense of older, better paid workers and pensioners. This would help redress some of the inter-generational imbalance in the tax and benefits system. Change would probably happen in three distinct stages. In the first stage, Whiting will look at ways of better aligning income tax and national insurance. That means seeing whether it is possible for NICs and income tax to be levied over the same time period and on the same things, perhaps exempting pensioner incomes. In the second stage, the chancellor would start to make the two indistinguishable by having the same starting point for paying NICs and income tax. The final stage would involve a single earnings tax that would amalgamate income tax and national insurance based on (at present) tax bands of 20%, 40% and 45%. Sure, there are obvious drawbacks, of which the most obvious is the likely backlash from pensioners. You can imagine Treasury officials telling the chancellor, in best Yes Minister fashion, that he is being awfully \u201ccourageous\u201d in risking so many votes. But as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted, the barriers do not seem insurmountable. There could be an enhanced personal allowance for pensioners or the state pension could be exempted from income tax altogether. Entitlements could be linked to years of residency or citizenship. Osborne\u2019s predecessors concluded that reform is more trouble than it is worth and he may well do the same. The chancellor has so far done little to make the tax system less complex; he has been a tinkerer rather than a reformer. It would be a real coup if he was to be able to achieve what Lawson, who was a genuine tax reformer, failed to do in the 1980s. If Osborne does get cold feet, Labour - struggling as it is to make any impact with voters - should seize the opportunity. Done properly, merger of tax and national insurance would increase employment while making the system simpler, fairer and more transparent. It is long overdue.",

      "body": "<p> </p> <p>Lloyd George introduced it. Labour made it the bedrock of its post-war state pension scheme. Nigel Lawson toyed with the idea of abolishing it only to go cool on the idea. What is it? It is national insurance, the little brother to income tax and now the subject of a new review commissioned by George Osborne.</p> <p>National insurance contributions are the ultimate stealth tax. They raise a lot of money for the exchequer while being far less politically charged. Osborne expects to net \u00a3115bn from NICs in the current financial year, almost the same as from VAT and around two-thirds of what he will get from income tax (\u00a3170bn).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/28/the-uncertain-relationship-between-national-insurance-and-income-tax\">The uncertain relationship between national insurance and income tax | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But whereas no chancellor since Denis Healey in the 1970s has dared raise the basic rate of income tax, when Gordon Brown wanted to raise serious amounts of cash in order to fund higher health spending in 2002 it was to NICs that he turned. </p> <p>There was a reason for this: NICs are less visible and can be raised without nearly so much political grief. The public believes that NICs are somehow ring-fenced, that the money paid by employees and employers goes into a fund that pays for the NHS and for pensions. This, though, has not been the case for a very long time.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/nov/10/uk-tax-system-mirrlees-review\">review of the tax system</a> conducted by the nobel prize winner Sir James Mirrlees noted: \u201cNational Insurance is not a true social insurance scheme; it is just another tax on earnings, and the current scheme invites politicians to play games with NICs without acknowledging that these are essentially part of the taxation of labour income. The two systems need to be merged.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear. Osborne is not proposing the immediate merging of NICs and income tax. Instead, he has asked <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-tax-simplification\">the Office of Tax Simplification (OTS)</a>, to see whether the two could remain separate but be better aligned. This is undoubtedly a more cautious approach to reform, but in the long term it could reach the same conclusion: full merger. Despite the considerable difficulties involved, this would be welcome.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why the chancellor is adopting a softly-softly approach. Income tax is based on yearly earnings, NICs on weekly earnings. Pensioners do not pay NICs, and nor do the under 16s. They are collected using separate computer systems, and the recent problems with government IT projects does not exactly inspire confidence that the two could be merged with ease.</p> <p>There are also concerns, especially on the left, that merging tax and NICs would mean the link between contributions and benefits would be severed once and for all. Once people no longer thought they were personally benefitting from the contributions they had made over the years, it would - so the argument goes - make it easier for a tax-cutting party to shrink the size of the state.</p> <p>Finally, there would be losers as well as winners from any change, and the likeliest losers would be pensioners, who also happen to be the segment of the population most likely to vote. All these are important concerns.</p> <p>It is also not hard to see why Osborne wants the OTS to have another look at this issue. Businesses, particularly small businesses, find the tax system complex and expensive to administer. They would make considerable savings from a single earnings tax and that would translate into higher profits and more jobs. John Whiting, director of the OTS says that his organisation\u2019s polls of business have highlighted concerns about the complexity of the system.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, Osborne\u2019s political narrative for this parliament is that the Conservatives are the party of working people. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-uk-gdp-other-rich-nations-george-osborne\">The rise in the minimum wage</a> (the so-called \u2018national living wage\u2019) and the increase in the personal allowance in the budget were designed to drive home this point.<br></p> <p>The impact of these changes was blunted by the decision to make tax credits less generous, a move that will take money away from the working families the chancellor says he wants to support. But a decision to merge tax and NICs would provide a fresh opportunity to drive home his political point.</p> <p>A full merger of income tax and national insurance would involve raising the threshold at which employees start paying NICs (currently \u00a38,060 a year for someone who works full time for a year) to the personal income tax allowance (currently \u00a310,600). This would mean those on low incomes paying less tax and getting the full benefit of Osborne\u2019s plan to raise the personal allowance to \u00a312,500 by the end of the parliament.</p> <p>The gap between the starting point for paying NICs and paying income tax has widened in recent years, because Osborne has used his budgets to deliver above-inflation increases in the personal allowance. Assuming that the chancellor wanted to make merger revenue neutral, the main beneficiaries would be younger workers on lower incomes, who would gain at the expense of older, better paid workers and pensioners. This would help redress some of the inter-generational imbalance in the tax and benefits system.</p> <p>Change would probably happen in three distinct stages.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s time to break free of the \u201ctyranny\u201d of \u201cquarterly capitalism\u201d, Hillary Clinton proclaimed in an economic stump speech on Friday afternoon at New York University. Translation? The Democratic Party\u2019s front-running presidential candidate is taking aim at Wall Street \u2013 sort of. Clinton is no Bernie Sanders, nor Elizabeth Warren, for that matter. For some she is, in fact, just a little too close to the money men. So perhaps unsurprisingly, instead of offering a wide-ranging critique of US capitalism, Clinton is taking aim at a very specific Wall Street ritual: the corporate earnings report. What makes her comments timely as well as interesting is the fact that they were delivered smack dab in the middle of the second quarter\u2019s \u201cearnings season\u201d \u2013 the six-week period during which the vast majority of publicly traded companies tell us how much money they made during the period from 1 April until 30 June, and analysts and traders rush to compare those figures to forecasts. When the numbers measure up \u2013 or even better, exceed \u2013 the forecasts, it\u2019s known as a \u201cbeat\u201d, and Good Things Happen. Just look at what happened to Google earlier this month when it delivered better-than-expected results, including an 11% jump in advertising revenue. The company\u2019s stock set off for the stratosphere, soaring 16.3%. That wasn\u2019t just Google\u2019s single best day in its own history as a public company, but the biggest one-day gain recorded by any public company, ever, as the total value of Google (the number of shares multiplied by the stock price) increased by a record $66.9bn to $478bn. It\u2019s as if Google gave birth to several giant new businesses overnight. Then there\u2019s Amazon, which also startled investors by reporting better-than-expected revenues and by announcing that it had actually made money instead of reporting a loss for the quarter. The stock soared 18%; now Amazon is worth more than Walmart. But if you disappoint, prepare to be punished; Wall Street is unforgiving. Only in the rather bizarre world of earnings season could a 38% gain in profitability and a 35% increase in iPhone sales be dubbed a \u201cdisappointment\u201d by analysts. But that\u2019s just what happened, in large part because some had expectations that were even higher, and because the company hinted that the current quarter could prove more lackluster. In a flash, $60bn evaporated from the value of the company\u2019s market capitalization. Ouch. Trying to deliver quarterly results that are on target, or a \u201cbeat\u201d, has long since become a game. Entire teams of analysts are devoted to tracking the process. So, for instance, as I write this, I can tell you that Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S calculates that of the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 index, 186, or 37%, have so far announced their results. Of those, 74% have beaten estimates, while 18% have reported earnings that were worse than analysts had anticipated. In a typical quarter (since 1994), 63% of companies beat estimates; in the last four quarters, 70% have beaten estimates. But remember that I described this as a game? Heading into reporting season, companies will deliver hints to analysts \u2013 hey, your earnings estimate for us is too high; you might want to trim it a bit. They\u2019ll do that throughout the quarter, going back and forth, until by the time the quarter is over, and the earnings are announced, what appears to be a \u201cbeat\u201d is actually a figure that is lower than the original forecast. In other words, if analysts hadn\u2019t cut their estimates, that beat would have been a \u201cmiss\u201d. Only if you\u2019ve been following the process, and have access to the fluctuating estimates \u2013 only if you\u2019re an insider \u2013 do you know whether a beat is really a beat, and whether to react with exuberance and excitement. Then, too, what\u2019s happening on the bottom line often isn\u2019t the full story. Consider toymaker Mattel Corp, which analysts were expecting to report a loss of 4 cents a share. When it actually reported a profit of a penny a share, that should have been good news, right? Wrong. That\u2019s still worse than the company\u2019s profits a year ago, and it was accompanied by an unexpected dip in revenues. When Hillary Clinton takes aim at \u201cquarterly capitalism\u201d, it\u2019s stuff like that she is thinking of. Well, that, and the antics that go on behind the scenes in corner offices in order for chief financial officers to deliver on the expectations of analysts and the investors who await each quarterly earnings season announcement anxiously. The critique is an old one, dating back decades. The demand to manage earnings on a quarterly basis frustrates CEOs themselves, many of whom loathe having to ensure their earnings are squarely on target or incur the wrath of activist investors like Carl Icahn or David Einhorn, who are capable of making their lives a living hell. And it is a real conundrum. On the one hand, CEOs and their chief financial officers are responsible to their investors; their job is to maximize profits. That\u2019s their fiduciary duty. So an investor who sees a company passing up an opportunity to make money this summer, and hears the CEO arguing next earnings season that he made that choice in order to invest in something that will (hopefully) produce even larger rewards in, say, 2017, might justifiably be annoyed. Many CEOs see that as too risky; they\u2019d like to keep their jobs and keep investors pacified, thank you very much. There\u2019s an equally valid argument that by taking those risks (and deferring today\u2019s profits), CEOs are doing their investors, and the economy as a whole, a greater disservice. It\u2019s worth noting, incidentally, that two of the companies that have delivered blockbuster \u201cpositive surprises\u201d so far this earnings season, Google and Amazon, are both headed by management teams with the ability or willingness to defy Wall Street and march to the sound of their own drummer. Google\u2019s co-founders still control the lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s voting stock, meaning that they can afford to shrug off grumpy investors, to some extent. Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos has made it clear that he\u2019ll tolerate large losses if that\u2019s what it takes to boost revenues and market share \u2013 and if investors don\u2019t share his vision, they don\u2019t have to stick around. Clinton argues that companies that become obsessed with \u201cquarterly capitalism\u201d risk throwing the whole system out of balance by focusing only on the short term. Her admittedly wonkish speech criticized \u201chit and run\u201d activist shareholders and the \u201cculture of short-term speculation\u201d, even if it was short of specifics on how to address those particular features of Wall Street. But we don\u2019t have to wait for Clinton \u2013 or any other politico \u2013 to lead the way. We can choose how we react to earnings releases, or fail to do so, for instance. Corporate earnings news does matter, but the noise that surrounds it rarely does. Forget about the \u201cbeats\u201d and \u201cmisses\u201d and focus on the context. What is intriguing about Amazon\u2019s announcement is the fact that the dramatic gain came from the company\u2019s cloud business, rather than the core retail operations with which we\u2019re all familiar. That might give you a lot of food for thought about what this means for other companies offering clients infrastructure web services platforms in the cloud, including Google, Microsoft and even Alibaba. Mattel\u2019s announcement got me thinking about the fact that companies are having to struggle to post higher profits \u2013 this could end up being the 16th quarter in a row in which earnings grow at a faster rate than revenues, Thomson Reuters has warned. That means the pressure will be on businesses to keep cutting costs to deliver the earnings that investors expect \u2013 including salaries and jobs. Then, too, it\u2019s always good to monitor earnings announcements for what companies say about what they see coming next. What\u2019s happening in China? Will oil prices bounce back to life? Are they worried about Greece or do they see it as a sideshow? CEOs and their chief financial honchos usually have a conference call with analysts after the release of earnings and that\u2019s when the analysts will grill them about what\u2019s going to happen next. One earnings season is now history, and Wall Street is looking ahead for clues about the next. If you really want to play the insider\u2019s game, so should you, by reading the (publicly available) transcripts. Wall Street may still write the rules of the earnings season game, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t tilt the boards a little bit in our favor, whether by figuring out what\u2019s going on or finding a way to play on our own terms.",

The <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/24/9031597/hillary-clinton-quarterly-capitalism\">demand to manage earnings on a quarterly basis</a> frustrates CEOs themselves, many of whom loathe having to ensure their earnings are squarely on target or incur the wrath of activist investors like Carl Icahn or David Einhorn, who are capable of making their lives a living hell. </p> <p>And it is a real conundrum. On the one hand, CEOs and their chief financial officers are responsible to their investors; their job is to maximize profits. That\u2019s their fiduciary duty. So an investor who sees a company passing up an opportunity to make money this summer, and hears the CEO arguing next earnings season that he made that choice in order to invest in something that will (hopefully) produce even larger rewards in, say, 2017, might justifiably be annoyed. Many CEOs see that as too risky; they\u2019d like to keep their jobs and keep investors pacified, thank you very much. There\u2019s an equally valid argument that by taking those risks (and deferring today\u2019s profits), CEOs are doing their investors, and the economy as a whole, a greater disservice. </p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting, incidentally, that two of the companies that have delivered blockbuster \u201cpositive surprises\u201d so far this earnings season, Google and Amazon, are both headed by management teams with the ability or willingness to defy Wall Street and march to the sound of their own drummer. Google\u2019s co-founders still control the lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s voting stock, meaning that they can afford to shrug off grumpy investors, to some extent. Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos has made it clear that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/1318819/amazon-shareholders-really-annoyed-jeff-bezos/\">he\u2019ll tolerate large losses</a> if that\u2019s what it takes to boost revenues and market share \u2013 and if investors don\u2019t share his vision, they don\u2019t have to stick around.</p> <p>Clinton argues that companies that become obsessed with \u201cquarterly capitalism\u201d risk throwing the whole system out of balance by focusing only on the short term. Her admittedly wonkish speech criticized \u201chit and run\u201d activist shareholders and the \u201cculture of short-term speculation\u201d, even if it was short of specifics on how to address those particular features of Wall Street.</p> <p>But we don\u2019t have to wait for Clinton \u2013 or any other politico \u2013 to lead the way. We can choose how we react to earnings releases, or fail to do so, for instance.</p> <p>Corporate earnings news does matter, but the noise that surrounds it rarely does. Forget about the \u201cbeats\u201d and \u201cmisses\u201d and focus on the context. What is intriguing about Amazon\u2019s announcement is the fact that the dramatic gain came from <a href=\"http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/183317/amazon-web-services-the-key-to-amazons-earnings-beat\">the company\u2019s cloud business</a>, rather than the core retail operations with which we\u2019re all familiar. That might give you a lot of food for thought about what this means for other companies offering clients infrastructure web services platforms in the cloud, including Google, Microsoft and even Alibaba. Mattel\u2019s announcement got me thinking about the fact that companies are having to struggle to post higher profits \u2013 this could end up being the 16th quarter in a row in which earnings grow at a faster rate than revenues, Thomson Reuters has warned. That means the pressure will be on businesses to keep cutting costs to deliver the earnings that investors expect \u2013 including salaries and jobs.</p> <p>Then, too, it\u2019s always good to monitor earnings announcements for what companies say about what they see coming next. What\u2019s happening in China? Will oil prices bounce back to life? Are they worried about Greece or do they see it as a sideshow? CEOs and their chief financial honchos usually have a conference call with analysts after the release of earnings and that\u2019s when the analysts will grill them about what\u2019s going to happen next. One earnings season is now history, and Wall Street is looking ahead for clues about the next. If you really want to play the insider\u2019s game, so should you, by reading the (publicly available) transcripts.</p> <p>Wall Street may still write the rules of the earnings season game, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t tilt the boards a little bit in our favor, whether by figuring out what\u2019s going on or finding a way to play on our own terms.</p>",

These blackouts prompted Cape Town native Charlotte Slingsby to seek out a solution after her family home was found to be unsuitable for solar panels. The result was Moya (wind in the Xhosa language), a new energy generation system: sheets of plastic have wave-like filaments attached that capture tiny amounts of wind energy that can then be stored in a battery. \u201cWe need an independent solution for today,\u201d Slingsby said. \u201cYou see a city which functions on electricity which just falls apart, from the most basic things like opening a door [or] an electric gate. You can\u2019t even take your car out of the garage.\u201d She cites serious examples, such as people on life support machines who depend on a reliable electricity supply for survival. In a security-conscious society like South Africa, the shutdown of alarm systems at night can also be an invitation to criminals. \u201cIt is quite terrifying and it is those day to day things that you forget about. Every part of your day changes,\u201d she said. Moya was developed during a two-year postgraduate course in innovation design engineering that Slingsby recently completed at the Royal College of Art (RCA) and Imperial College London. The system is aimed at accumulating small pieces of energy into a larger mass, in a similar way to drops of rain gathering together to eventually form a stream. \u201cI thought \u2018ow do you come up with a new type of material- one that can accumulate all of those abundant but lower grade forms of energy?\u2019\u201d The plastic sheets have slivers of bendable filaments that stand up and are moved by gusts of air. The filaments, which are encased in plastic, work using the piezoelectric effect \u2013 the ability of some materials to generate a charge in response to pressure. In this case, when the filaments are moved by gusts of wind, tiny pieces of energy are created. For her prototype, Slingsby used a flexible film of polyvinylidene fluoride. \u201cThey have the ability to transform strain or bending energy into electrical energy,\u201d she said. This energy is then passed on to a capacitor \u2013 a device used to store an electrical charge \u2013 and then eventually on to a battery. Like the rain over a mountain, \u201cthousands of tiny drops need to be accumulated to have enough energy to bring itself to the rivers and eventually to the sea\u201d. From tests she has carried out on wind tunnels, Slingsby has calculated that her prototype Moya system can generate about 10% of the energy per sq metre that a solar panel can. But the advantageof her sheets is that they can be installed in areas where solar panels cannot, such as under bridges. \u201cIt is reduced in efficiency but it is looking at a new type of material which has the ability to go in far more locations. It is all about accessibility to captured energy.\u201d One possible location for the panels is on the London underground. \u201cEvery tube is stopping and starting all the time and as it stops you can actually line the section of tunnel where it is slowing down, which almost assists the breaking through the added drag, and absorbs this wasted energy,\u201d Slingsby said. In theory, the sheets can be mounted anywhere, she said, including on the side of a skyscraper, but light would still be able to get through. It will be some time before the system makes it that far. Slingsby said it could take between five and 10 years \u2013 after significant amount of research \u2013 to get to a marketable product. Among the problems she faces is encouraging people to accept another form of energy generation. \u201cWhat has to be understood is that in the future, whatever energy we are able to absorb freely is actually really valuable and there is going to be lots of different methods with different environments no matter how you look at it,\u201d she said. Power to the people The energy crisis which has hit South Africa has sparked often daily blackouts and has hit growth projections for the country. The blackouts are known as \u201cload shedding\u2019, where there is not enough power to cover the whole area resulting in sections being shut off. South Africa\u2019s president, Jacob Zuma, blamed the poor infrastructure on apartheid, saying the system had been built to service only the white population. About 11 million people have power now in South Africa, twice the number in 1994. The problems have also been blamed on poor management and lack of investment.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s growth rate returned to Mach 2 speed in the spring and early summer. That\u2019s the consensus among City analysts ahead of official figures out this week, handing George Osborne another golden arrow with which to shoot down his critics. It is the re-emergence of the big-spending consumer (who snaps up a new bed and sofa while ordering a case of wine) that is likely to have prevented the UK economy from repeating the lacklustre growth rate of 0.4% seen in the first three months of the year. Most analysts expect the Office for National Statistics to report on Tuesday that GDP jumped by 0.7% for the three months to the end of June. That\u2019s an annualised GDP increase of 2.8%, which is enough to put supersonic Britain streets ahead of its developed-world rivals. Yet a peek beneath the data reveals a picture that Osborne and the interest-rate-setters in Threadneedle Street ignore at their peril. Based on what we already know from the official figures and those published for individual industry sectors, the main boost to the second quarter figures will come from the very same source of weakness in the first quarter \u2013 the North Sea. Last year saw a dive in North Sea oil and gas production as operators reacted to the dramatic fall in crude oil prices. In recent months, rigs taken out of action for maintenance have come back on stream, encouraged by a moderate recovery in prices (though they are falling again now, along with other commodities) and a more generous tax regime announced by Osborne in the March budget. The result was an enormous 9% increase in output between the first and second quarters. Making matters worse, manufacturing is in the doldrums. Since last summer, growth has slowed to a point where output was actually lower than the year before (down 0.4% from May 2014 to May 2015). Great hopes for pharmaceuticals makers, specialist textiles and machinery manufacture have been dashed. Mining and quarrying is in decline and metal smelting has all but disappeared. Filling some of the void are the stellar motor and aerospace industries, which prevent Britain\u2019s manufacturing from being limited to the output of a few niche products. The services sector is also doing its bit: from hotels and leisure to the health sector and online shopping, businesses are expanding and taking on more workers. They are even reporting skills shortages despite there still being more than 1.8 million unemployed. Pay has also rebounded and, according to official figures, wage growth is averaging 3.2% while inflation remains flat, giving workers a welcome income boost. So that\u2019s a dose of good news at least. Is it enough to warrant a smile on Tory faces? Bank of England policymakers seem to think so. They are preparing to raise interest rates in the expectation that higher real wages will send inflation rocketing. But those among the nine monetary policy committee members who prefer to ignore weaknesses in the UK\u2019s growth story are likely to be embarrassed. If rates go up in November or possibly next February, the betting must be that they will soon come down again. With higher interest rates must come a higher pound. It is already strong against the euro; if there is another surge on the foreign exchange markets, billions of pounds\u2019 worth of exports could be priced out by cheaper competition. Much of this loss will be felt by manufacturers. GDP will suffer. More importantly for the MPC\u2019s inflation-watchers, a higher pound will make imports cheaper and bring down prices, which resurrects the threat of deflation and thus the need for an interest rate cut. The embarrassment of cutting back rates after a bold rise is something the Swedes and Canadians know all about. Their central bankers tried it and \u2013 in the case of Sweden \u2013 now have negative interest rates for their trouble. So surely it would be better for the MPC to hold fire. Then the UK\u2019s still-weak economic recovery can keep climbing. Tories need to get climate change story straight Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, is a true Janus: the Roman god famous for facing in two directions at the same time. In her first major speech on global warming on Friday, Rudd insisted climate change was a dangerous threat she took most seriously and which would be tackled for the sake of families and businesses alike. But this was the same Rudd who earlier in the week had overseen the scrapping of the Green Deal scheme to make homes more energy efficient and the end of certain solar subsidies. She has already scrapped financial aid for onshore wind \u2013 the cheapest of all renewable energy technologies \u2013 and has overseen the lowering of taxes on polluting companies while ending tax breaks on cleaner cars. Most of these measures, argues Rudd, can be taken because the subsidy schemes are not working properly or because wind and solar are so successful they don\u2019t need support anymore. She also claims to be standing up for \u201chard-working families\u201d by cutting energy bills. Rudd also wants to see free-market solutions, not state or consumer-funded ones \u2013 although different rules seem to apply to nuclear power. But many see an ideological cuts agenda barely concealed behind consumer-champion rhetoric. It is true the Conservatives publicly promised to be the \u201cgreenest government ever\u201d, but privately admitted it wanted rid of \u201cthe green crap\u201d . The real truth is that tackling global warming costs money, even if more of the cost comes via the taxpayer than through higher energy bills. But we need to pay now rather than leave subsequent generations to face the devastating and much more costly impact later on. Global warming is a threat that has not been and cannot be tackled by any pure free-market solution. It cannot be driven by companies worried about three-monthly financial cycles, or be achieved in a world where fossil fuels do not pay for the damage they cause. For a party that claims to support business and the commercial imperative, it is also astonishing to see the rug being pulled from under the renewable energy industry just as this job-creating sector really takes off. Should Hornby be derailed? A parliamentary commission into who was to blame for the near-collapse of HBOS in 2008 said the bank\u2019s chief executive Andy Hornby had \u201cproved unable or unwilling to change course\u201d to save it from bankruptcy. It is not yet known what a report by the City regulators into the debacle will conclude, as it is long-delayed and no publication date is in sight. But shareholders have always maintained that there should never again be a place for Hornby on the board of a listed company. Since 2011 he has been chief executive of bookmaker Gala Coral. While it was privately owned, that was no problem. On Friday it merged with Ladbrokes to become a market-listed business. Hornby will not be on the main board, but will be chief operating officer. It is now up to City shareholders to decide if he should be given a second chance.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s growth rate returned to Mach 2 speed in the spring and early summer. That\u2019s the consensus among City analysts ahead of official figures out this week, handing George Osborne another golden arrow with which to shoot down his critics.</p> <p>It is the re-emergence of the big-spending consumer (who snaps up a new bed and sofa while ordering a case of wine) that is likely to have prevented the UK economy from repeating the lacklustre growth rate of 0.4% seen in the first three months of the year.</p> <p>Most analysts expect the Office for National Statistics to report on Tuesday that GDP jumped by 0.7% for the three months to the end of June. That\u2019s an annualised GDP increase of 2.8%, which is enough to put supersonic Britain streets ahead of its developed-world rivals.</p> <p>Yet a peek beneath the data reveals a picture that Osborne and the interest-rate-setters in Threadneedle Street ignore at their peril.</p> <p>Based on what we already know from the official figures and those published for individual industry sectors, the main boost to the second quarter figures will come from the very same source of weakness in the first quarter \u2013 the North Sea.</p> <p>Last year saw a dive in North Sea oil and gas production as operators reacted to the dramatic fall in crude oil prices. In recent months, rigs taken out of action for maintenance have come back on stream, encouraged by a moderate recovery in prices (though they are falling again now, along with other commodities) and a more generous tax regime announced by Osborne in the March budget. The result was an enormous 9% increase in output between the first and second quarters.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>If rates go up in November or possibly next February, the betting must be that they will soon come down again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Making matters worse, manufacturing is in the doldrums. Since last summer, growth has slowed to a point where output was actually lower than the year before (<a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/iop/index-of-production/may-2015/stb-iop-may-2015.html#tab-Production-and-sectors-supplemetary-analysis\" title=\"\">down 0.4% from May 2014 to May 2015</a>). Great hopes for pharmaceuticals makers, specialist textiles and machinery manufacture have been dashed. Mining and quarrying is in decline and metal smelting has all but disappeared.</p> <p>Filling some of the void are the stellar motor and aerospace industries, which prevent Britain\u2019s manufacturing from being limited to the output of a few niche products. The services sector is also doing its bit: from hotels and leisure to the health sector and online shopping, businesses are expanding and taking on more workers. They are even reporting skills shortages despite there still being more than 1.8 million unemployed. Pay has also rebounded and, according to official figures, wage growth is averaging 3.2% while inflation remains flat, giving workers a welcome income boost. So that\u2019s a dose of good news at least.</p> <p>Is it enough to warrant a smile on Tory faces? Bank of England policymakers seem to think so. They are preparing to raise interest rates in the expectation that higher real wages will send inflation rocketing. But those among the nine monetary policy committee members who prefer to ignore weaknesses in the UK\u2019s growth story are likely to be embarrassed. If rates go up in November or possibly next February, the betting must be that they will soon come down again.</p> <p>With higher interest rates must come a higher pound. It is already strong against the euro; if there is another surge on the foreign exchange markets, billions of pounds\u2019 worth of exports could be priced out by cheaper competition. Much of this loss will be felt by manufacturers. GDP will suffer.</p> <p>More importantly for the MPC\u2019s inflation-watchers, a higher pound will make imports cheaper and bring down prices, which resurrects the threat of deflation and thus the need for an interest rate cut.</p> <p>The embarrassment of cutting back rates after a bold rise is something the Swedes and Canadians know all about. Their central bankers tried it and \u2013 in the case of Sweden \u2013 now have negative interest rates for their trouble. So surely it would be better for the MPC&#xa0;to hold fire. Then the UK\u2019s still-weak economic recovery can keep climbing.</p> <h2>Tories need to get climate change story straight</h2> <p>Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, is a true Janus: the Roman god famous for facing in two directions at the same time. In her first major speech on global warming on Friday, Rudd insisted climate change was a dangerous threat she took most seriously and which would be tackled for the sake of families and businesses alike.</p> <p>But this was the same Rudd who earlier in the week had overseen the scrapping of the Green Deal scheme to make homes more energy efficient and the end of certain solar subsidies.</p> <p>She has already scrapped financial aid for onshore wind \u2013 the cheapest of all renewable energy technologies \u2013 and has overseen the lowering of taxes on polluting companies while ending tax breaks on cleaner cars.</p> <p>Most of these measures, argues Rudd, can be taken because the subsidy schemes are not working properly or because wind and solar are so successful they don\u2019t need support anymore.</p> <p>She also claims to be standing up for \u201chard-working families\u201d by cutting energy bills.

      "bodyText": "Of all the results announcements in the City this week, the one you really don\u2019t want to be involved with will be hosted by the leisure group Merlin Entertainments. That\u2019s not because the numbers might be disappointing (and they probably will be) but because the company is the owner of Alton Towers, the theme park where last month\u2019s horrific rollercoaster accident left four people seriously injured. To be scrupulously fair to the company, it did immediately take \u201cfull responsibility to those who had been injured in the accident\u201d and confirmed it would \u201censure that compensation will be provided to them\u201d \u2013 but to City ears that just adds to the sense that spreadsheets now need to be tweaked. In a research note, Barclays says: \u201cWe estimate that the incident on the Smiler rollercoaster will have negatively impacted performance from 1) park closure for five days; 2) slower volumes following reopening and more promotional activity; 3) some impact at Chessington and Thorpe Park due to other ride closures\u201d, while UBS foresees the potential for the shares to fall (and then for someone else to cash in). \u201cIf the valuation becomes more attractive we could potentially become more positive on the shares,\u201d the Swiss bank says, before considering \u201cusing any weakness as a buying opportunity\u201d. Pharma\u2019s legal headaches In the world of pharmaceuticals, it\u2019s all about the pipeline \u2013 and this week gives an excellent chance to ask how efficiently it\u2019s working, with results from the UK\u2019s two big drugs groups. In one sense, the answer will be \u201cas brilliantly as ever\u201d, as the top minds in both GSK and AstraZeneca retain a trail of blockbuster legal battles, requiring millions of pounds to cure. Just under a year ago GSK paid a \u00a3301m fine to the Chinese government after it got caught (in its words) offering \u201cmoney or property to non-government personnel in order to obtain improper commercial gains\u201d. Undeterred, that still leaves five full pages of its annual report to deal with other legal matters, including the ongoing investigation by the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office, plus another being conducted by America\u2019s department of justice, which is examining the whole industry under its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That one also affects AstraZeneca, whose own investigation into what its people have been up to has unearthed \u201cindications of inappropriate conduct in certain countries\u201d. Still, expect the City to ignore all that this week, and focus on the pipeline for products. Greggs on a roll The most important City news of last week was, of course, provided by Jake Gyllenhaal, the film actor who made his name in some critically acclaimed cowboy movie (City Slickers?). In an interview with Magic FM, he mused: \u201cI eat Greggs, Greggs baguettes \u2013 that\u2019s what I eat when I\u2019m in London.\u201d Obviously, the latest edition of Hardens\u2019 Best London Restaurants is being pulped as we write, while you\u2019ll be astonished to discover that the bakery chain is reporting interim results this week, which will presumably involve a presentation on the sales of steak bakes from Leonardo DiCaprio, before Dame Judy Dench breaks off from munching a jam doughnut to dissect the group\u2019s earnings per share. Still, despite Greggs\u2019s diligent PR efforts since the Gyllenhaal plug, one wonders if there might be some sort of Hollywood in-joke here? Strangely, the actor has form when it comes to sandwiches, what with snaps of him seemingly laughing at his butties going viral on the internet, plus a bizarre appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, when he performed a song called Gonna Eat That Talkin\u2019 Sandwich and told his host: \u201cMy favourite sandwich is a Primanti Brothers\u2019 sandwich, it has the french fries in the sandwich and coleslaw.\u201d",
