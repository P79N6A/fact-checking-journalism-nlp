      "bodyText": "The UK's largest retailer, Tesco, is to ban sweets and chocolates from its checkouts after a survey of customers showed overwhelming support for the move. Research for Tesco found that 65% of shoppers wanted confectionery removed from checkouts to help them make healthier choices when shopping. Even more (67%) said it would help them choose healthier options for their children. Tesco removed sweets and chocolates from checkouts at its 740 larger Tesco stores 20 years ago, but they will now be removed from checkouts at all stores, including 1,800 Tesco Metro and Express convenience stores in Britain and Ireland. The retailer committed to removing them by the end of December 2014, but has brought forward the move after surveying its customers. Its chief executive, Philip Clarke, said the decision followed a commitment to make soft drinks, sandwiches and ready meals healthier by changing the recipes to reduce their sugar, salt and fat content. \"We all know how easy it is to be tempted by sugary snacks at the checkout, and we want to help our customers lead healthier lives,\" Clarke said. Tesco was the first British supermarket to remove sweets and chocolates from checkouts at larger stores, in 1994. The retailer will now test a variety of healthier products at checkouts before implementing the full change across all stores. In January, Lidl banned confectionery from the checkout at all 600 of its British stores after surveying parents. It replaced racks of sweets with dried and fresh fruit, oatcakes and juices. Health campaigners and parents' groups welcomed Tesco's move. Katie O'Donovan of Mumsnet said: \"Popping into a shop with a small child in tow can sometimes feel like navigating an assault course. If you've made it to the checkout in one piece it can be really frustrating to then be faced with an unhealthy array of sweets designed to tempt your child. It's really positive to see a supermarket responding to the views of their customers and trying to make life that little bit easier.\" Ben Reynolds of the food and health charity Sustain agreed. \"Parents will be delighted to hear that they will no longer be pestered for fatty, salty and sugary snacks while queuing at the checkout in their local Tesco. We hope that other supermarkets will now follow Lidl and Tesco's lead, and realise that taking action to improve children's health is not something to fear.\" Tesco was among those criticised in research published in January which found that convenience stores run by big supermarket chains involved in the government's responsibility deal on nutrition were exposing children to displays of sweets and snack food at the checkout. Researchers from Sheffield University visited the smaller stores of Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco in the city and discovered what harassed parents often complain of \u2013 that the queue for the checkout often passes shelves laden with chocolate bars, drinks and sweet snacks at children's eye level.",

      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s closed part of its corporate headquarters on Wednesday in response to a mass protest by workers and activists that campaigners say ended in more than 100 arrests. Over 2,000 people calling for a hike in the minimum wage and the right to form a union without retaliation descended on the fast food giant\u2019s suburban Chicago headquarters in what is believed to be the largest demonstration McDonald\u2019s has ever faced. Chanting, \u201cHey McDonald\u2019s You Can\u2019t Hide, We Can See Your Greedy Side,\u201d and \u201cNo Big Macs, No Fries, Make our Wage Supersize,\u201d protesters blocked the entrance to McDonald\u2019s campus in Oakbrook, some 20 miles outside Chicago. A short walk from Hamburger University, McDonald\u2019s training center, the protesters were confronted by a phalanx of police officers in riot gear. After they sat down the police issued two orders to disperse and arrests began. Police said 101 McDonald's workers and 38 community supporters were arrested. McDonald\u2019s workers, church leaders and Service Employees International Union president Mary Kay Henry were among those arrested. Some 500 fast-food workers from three dozen cities as well as local church groups, union activists and community groups were present at the demonstration. It came a day before the fast food company\u2019s annual meeting when dissident shareholders intend to vote against CEO Donald Thompson\u2019s $9.5m pay package. Protesters also plan to picket that meeting, from which media have been excluded. Activists said the company feared a \"public relations minefield\" and had sent workers home in order to derail the protest. Protesters moved their demonstration to another nearby McDonald\u2019s corporate facility. A McDonald's spokeswoman said the company had taken the decision to close the a building on its campus that holds 2,000 staff after consultation with police. The building was close to a busy intersection and the company was concerned about the disruption the protesters could cause to traffic. She said staff continued to work from home. Restaurant and retail workers are calling for a minimum wage of $15 per hour. The latest protest is one of a series aimed at fueling a national debate on income inequality and comes after a report from the Demos thinktank showed that fast-food companies had the largest gap between the pay of CEOs and workers of any industry. The report found that the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio for the fast-food industry was more than 1,000-to-one in 2013. Amanda Wenninghoff, 28, has been working for McDonald\u2019s in Kansas City for 10 years and travelled to Chicago to call for a wage rise. She earns $8 an hour and said she hadn\u2019t had a wage raise since 2003. \u201cI have lived in my car with my kids because I haven\u2019t had the wages to support a place for us to live,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI have friends who need life-saving surgery they can\u2019t afford.\u201d She said McDonald\u2019s offered health insurance, but it would cost $400 a month for her alone \u2013about half her monthly salary. \u201cIt would be impossible for me to get by without government assistance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe least they can do is pay us enough money so we can afford to live instead of putting it on the taxpayers.\u201d McDonald\u2019s worker Ashona Osborne, 24, travelled from Pittsburgh to protest. She makes $7.25 an hour and said her wages had been cut since she had started to protest. \u201cI need better support for me and my family,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just McDonald\u2019s, I have been working on minimum wage since I was 16 and it\u2019s very, very difficult. I have decide which priority to take care of, which bill can I pay.\u201d She said Thompson $9.5m pay package worked out at about $6,600 an hour. \u201cHe makes more money than me on the way to work,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. They can afford to give me more money. If it weren\u2019t for us workers there would be no McDonald\u2019s, no Burger King, no Wendy\u2019s.\u201d On Thursday, shareholder activist Change to Win Investment Group (Ctw) is organising a vote against Thompson, who took over as CEO in 2012. It follows similar protests against CEO pay at other restaurant groups including Domino\u2019s and Chipotle. Earlier this month, 77% of Chipotle shareholders voted against the compensation packages of co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran, worth $25.1m and $24.4m respectively in 2013. The vote, which is non-binding and was also organised by CtW, has prompted a review of compensation at the company. The pressure for change comes as President Obama has pushed Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour from the current $7.25. The move is being challenged by Republicans and by lobbyists for the restaurant industry who claim it will cost jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates that there are 3.5m fast-food and counter workers in the US, and they earn a median hourly wage of $8.83 \u2013 almost $18,400 per year based on a 40-hour work week without vacation. Earlier this year the Congressional Budget Office said a hike in the minimum wage to $10.10 would cost 500,000 jobs by 2016 but boost earnings for about 16.5 million low-wage workers. The National Restaurant Association said the report was proof that a wage hike was detrimental for the economy. \u201cThe restaurant industry provides real pathways to the middle class and beyond, and dramatic increases in the minimum wage will only hinder our ability to provide stepping stones for those who need it most,\u201d the association said in a statement.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "AstraZeneca directors unmoved by shareholder calls to reopen Pfizer talks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca's directors remained defiant on Wednesday night in the face of calls from one of the drugs company's biggest shareholders to reopen talks with its unwanted suitor, the US-based Pfizer group. With less than five days left until the 5pm deadline on Monday when Pfizer has to table a firm offer or walk away for six months, AXA Investment Managers and Legal &amp; General expressed disappointment with AstraZeneca's refusal to negotiate with its US rival. While Astra's management were hoping that their rejection of Pfizer's increased \u00a355-a-share bid proposal, tabled on Sunday, would end the US group's ambitions, some investors in the Anglo-Swedish company remain keen for a deal to be agreed. Even though one key investor, Threadneedle Asset Management, threw its weight behind the Astra board, most of the focus in the City was on a report in the Wall Street Journal saying that Legal &amp; General, AstraZeneca's sixth-largest shareholder with 3.4% of the UK firm, had written to AstraZeneca demanding they go back to the negotiating table. Legal &amp; General refused to deny the report. Pfizer cannot raise its offer under UK takeover rules before Monday and has ruled out going hostile. But it is understood to be working behind the scenes to get investors to express their anger. AstraZeneca shares rose 2.6% to \u00a344.20 amid hopes a deal could still happen this year, while investment bank UBS raised AstraZeneca's standalone value to \u00a350 a share. Jim Stride, head of UK equities at AXA Investment Managers, which holds a 0.89% stake in AstraZeneca, said the board was \"arguably wrong and acted too hastily to dismiss the latest proposal from Pfizer\". He added: \"It is the view of AXA IM UK that the board of AstraZeneca should not prevent an offer from Pfizer of \u00a355 per share from being put to the shareholders of the company. Many shareholders \u2013 but not necessarily all \u2013 will find this an attractive offer.\" Other parts of the AXA insurance group, which own at least another 3% of AstraZeneca, could share Stride's views, but the insurer refused to comment. Stride's statement came after Threadneedle Asset Management, with a 1.5% stake in AstraZeneca, publicly backed the board. \"We feel the full implications of the proposed acquisition have not been sufficiently understood and addressed by Pfizer. The company has made notable progress under Pascal Soriot and is a strong, standalone UK business with a good product pipeline.\" Sweden's Investor AB, with a 4.1% stake, Aberdeen Asset Management, M&amp;G, Fidelity and Neil Woodford, the influential City investor who controls a \u00a3350m stake on behalf of St James's Place, have all voiced support of AstraZeneca. Together they control more than 10% of AstraZeneca shares. Among the \"rebels\", Schroders, which is AstraZeneca's 12th-biggest shareholder, Schafer Cullen Capital Management, a New York-based investment firm that controls a 1.5% stake on behalf of clients, and Jupiter Asset Management have all expressed disappointment at AstraZeneca's refusal to negotiate. Those who have spoken out against the board control about 7% of AstraZeneca shares, but have not mounted a coordinated action. One suggestion circulating was that they could call an extraordinary general meeting to put Pfizer's offer to a vote. The support of just 5% of holders of AstraZeneca stock is needed to call an extraordinary general meeting, but it could not take place before next Monday's deadline. If an EGM was held after the deadline, shareholders could force AstraZeneca to reopen talks with Pfizer in late August after the obligatory three-month cooling-off period. Shareholders angry at AstraZeneca's refusal to engage further with Pfizer have so far outlined no specific proposals that would enable a deal to happen within the takeover rules. But one possibility put forward by analysts is that AstraZeneca could recommend the \u00a355-a-share proposal on the understanding that it would pay a big special dividend, agreed with Pfizer, when the deal completed. Such a plan would in effect increase the payout to shareholders \u2013 but it would probably be in breach of UK takeover rules. AstraZeneca has been clear in its rejection of Pfizer's offer and a U-turn by the board appears very unlikely. As part of its defence strategy Astra Zeneca has talked up its pipeline of potential cancer treatments and predicted a 75% jump in annual revenues to more than $45bn by 2023. However, Pfizer's former top scientist John LaMattina, who spent 30 years at the New York drugmaker, questioned AstraZeneca's ability to meet its targets. \"Ironically, to reach his sales target, Soriot himself may need to do a merger,\" he said. Unions representing workers at AstraZeneca's sites in Macclesfield backed the company's rejection of the Pfizer bid and called for a meeting with Soriot to discuss job prospects. They said: \"Union representatives call on the board to face down pressure from all quarters to get into negotiations with Pfizer for an agreed bid and to brace to fight any hostile bid.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 22 May",

      "body": "<p>AstraZeneca's directors remained defiant on Wednesday night in the face of calls from one of the drugs company's biggest shareholders to reopen talks with its unwanted suitor, the US-based Pfizer group.</p> <p>With less than five days left until the 5pm deadline on Monday when Pfizer has to table a firm offer or walk away for six months, AXA Investment Managers and Legal &amp; General expressed disappointment with AstraZeneca's refusal to negotiate with its US rival.</p> <p>While Astra's management were hoping that their rejection of Pfizer's increased \u00a355-a-share bid proposal, tabled on Sunday, would end the US group's ambitions, some investors in the Anglo-Swedish company remain keen for a deal to be agreed.</p> <p>Even though one key investor, Threadneedle Asset Management, threw its weight behind the Astra board, most of the focus in the City was on a report in the Wall Street Journal saying that Legal &amp; General, AstraZeneca's sixth-largest shareholder with 3.4% of the UK firm, had written to AstraZeneca demanding they go back to the negotiating table. Legal &amp; General refused to deny the report.</p> <p>Pfizer cannot raise its offer under UK takeover rules before Monday and has ruled out going hostile. But it is understood to be working behind the scenes to get investors to express their anger.</p> <p>AstraZeneca shares rose 2.6% to \u00a344.20 amid hopes a deal could still happen this year, while investment bank UBS raised AstraZeneca's standalone value to \u00a350 a share.</p> <p>Jim Stride, head of UK equities at AXA Investment Managers, which holds a 0.89% stake in AstraZeneca, said the board was \"arguably wrong and acted too hastily to dismiss the latest proposal from Pfizer\". He added: \"It is the view of AXA IM UK that the board of AstraZeneca should not prevent an offer from Pfizer of \u00a355 per share from being put to the shareholders of the company. Many shareholders \u2013 but not necessarily all \u2013 will find this an attractive offer.\"</p> <p>Other parts of the AXA insurance group, which own at least another 3% of AstraZeneca, could share Stride's views, but the insurer refused to comment.</p> <p>Stride's statement came after Threadneedle Asset Management, with a 1.5% stake in AstraZeneca, publicly backed the board. \"We feel the full implications of the proposed acquisition have not been sufficiently understood and addressed by Pfizer. The company has made notable progress under Pascal Soriot and is a strong, standalone UK business with a good product pipeline.\"</p> <p>Sweden's Investor AB, with a 4.1% stake, Aberdeen Asset Management, M&amp;G, Fidelity and Neil Woodford, the influential City investor who controls a \u00a3350m stake on behalf of St James's Place, have all voiced support of AstraZeneca. Together they control more than 10% of AstraZeneca shares.</p> <p>Among the \"rebels\", Schroders, which is AstraZeneca's 12th-biggest shareholder, Schafer Cullen Capital Management, a New York-based investment firm that controls a 1.5% stake on behalf of clients, and Jupiter Asset Management have all expressed disappointment at AstraZeneca's refusal to negotiate. Those who have spoken out against the board control about 7% of AstraZeneca shares, but have not mounted a coordinated action.</p> <p>One suggestion circulating was that they could call an extraordinary general meeting to put Pfizer's offer to a vote. The support of just 5% of holders of AstraZeneca stock is needed to call an extraordinary general meeting, but it could not take place before next Monday's deadline.</p> <p>If an EGM was held after the deadline, shareholders could force AstraZeneca to reopen talks with Pfizer in late August after the obligatory three-month cooling-off period.</p> <p>Shareholders angry at AstraZeneca's refusal to engage further with Pfizer have so far outlined no specific proposals that would enable a deal to happen within the takeover rules.</p> <p>But one possibility put forward by analysts is that AstraZeneca could recommend the \u00a355-a-share proposal on the understanding that it would pay a big special dividend, agreed with Pfizer, when the deal completed.</p> <p>Such a plan would in effect increase the payout to shareholders \u2013 but it would probably be in breach of UK takeover rules. AstraZeneca has been clear in its rejection of Pfizer's offer and a U-turn by the board appears very unlikely.</p> <p>As part of its defence strategy Astra Zeneca has talked up its pipeline of potential cancer treatments and predicted a 75% jump in annual revenues to more than $45bn by 2023.

    "webTitle": "Retail sales up 6.9% in April, making early rate rise likely", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Retailers enjoyed their best month for a decade in April, with sales up 6.9% on the same month a year ago, providing further evidence of recovery and raising the prospects for an early interest-rate rise. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the volume of sales rose 1.3% on March levels, boosted by spending during Easter in the shops and online last month. The housing market, which had showed some signs of slowing in February and March, regained its previous momentum in April as buyers increased their borrowing, undeterred by tighter restrictions on mortgage loans put in place by the City's consumer watchdog. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said gross mortgage lending amounted to \u00a316.6bn last month, up 8% on March and more than a third higher than the same time last year. Investors reacted to the news, which comes ahead of revised GDP figures that are expected to confirm the UK as the fastest growing of the major developed nations, by pushing the pound higher against the dollar and the euro. But the resurgence in high street spending and stronger-than-expected housebuying activity immediately sparked concerns that the Bank of England will be forced to raise interest rates to prevent the economy overheating. The Bank has come under intense pressure from some City institutions to raise rates since the economy began to recover early last year. Until recently the Bank's monetary policy committee, which sets interest-rate policy, has insisted that rates needed to stay at historic lows until unemployment fell to nearer its long-term average and wages increased consistently above inflation. Economists had expected the Bank to begin raising rates early next year. However, the minutes of the MPC's meeting earlier this month revealed the first signs of a split among policymakers as disagreements flared over the strength of the recovery and when to lift rates back to more normal levels. A speech by outgoing deputy governor Charlie Bean earlier this week added to the tension when he said regulatory tools designed to calm the housing market may not work and the central bank may be unable to resist rasing rates to prevent a bubble. Carney said in a recent TV interview that the housing market posed the biggest threat to the long term health of the economy. Several MPC members have voiced concerns that forecasts of a moderation in consumer spending and housebuying could prove too pessimistic. Figures from financial data provider Markit appeared to justify their position, showing that households were more confident in April about the outlook for their finances than at any time in the past five years. The survey found that more households no longer fear redundancy and more expect their incomes to rise than since 2009. Economists said rising confidence and a bounce back from poor weather in March pushed retail sales in the latest quarter \u2013 considered a better guide to the underlying trend than one month's figures \u2013 up 1.8% on the previous three months. Both the annual and the quarterly increases were the highest since the spring of 2004. The ONS said there had been an across-the-board increase in sales last month, with food stores posting their strongest annual growth rates in 12 years. Supermarket price wars are believed to have been a factor in the 6.3% rise in sales in the year to April. After a weak March, spending online bounced back in April, the ONS, said, rising by 2.6% on the month to a level 13.3% higher than in April 2013. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, said: \"The UK economy is motoring, fuelled, for now, by consumption, and the Bank's rate-setters are shifting their views in response. \"The minutes of the BoE's latest rate setting meeting, in early May, had a less dovish tone, which contrasts with Mark Carney's dovish words after last week's Inflation Report. \"These data support our forecasts for above-consensus growth and a first rate hike coming in Q1 2015. We see a 35% chance that the BoE hikes in Q4 2014.\" \"The boost in consumer spending came despite a continued squeeze on real incomes caused by wages struggling to keep pace with prices. Howard Archer, UK economist with IHS Global Insight, said: \"Retail sales were mightily impressive in April, even allowing for a major boost coming from the later Easter this year. This bodes very well for GDP growth in the second quarter.\" Archer said he expected earnings to start to outstrip prices over the next few months. \"The strong housing market is also supportive to retail sales,\" he added.",

About 180 jobs are going from Warrington \u2013 which will close \u2013 with 120 moving to Speke, Liverpool. In total 645 jobs are going across several areas, although 65 will be created. \"This is the third tranche of job losses since the beginning of the year and is in danger of sending staff morale to an all-time low,\" said Rob MacGregor, of Unite. \"The closure of the Warrington centre will hit the local economy and risks damaging customer service,\" he added. Officials at the Accord union said there was \"no end in sight\" for job cuts. A Lloyds spokesperson said: \"Telephone banking call volumes are falling as digital banking continues to grow, and we are refocusing the business to reflect these changes in our customers' habits, while ensuring we maintain our high standards for those who wish to continue using our telephone banking systems by bringing our telephone banking colleagues together at fewer, more specialised sites.\"",

As Giorgos Kaminis and Gabriel Sakellarides, the two candidates for the Athens mayoralty prepare to face each other in a live debate this evening, it is Golden Dawn, the far right party which has blossomed with the country\u2019s economic crisis, that is dominating events. The extremist group\u2019s surprisingly strong performance in the first round of last Sunday\u2019s local and regional elections \u2013 at 16.1 % its own candidate for mayor Ilias Kasidiaris more than doubled the party\u2019s 6.9% showing in national elections in 2012 \u2013 has sparked concerns across the political spectrum. Deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos, who heads the coalition government\u2019s junior partner, Pasok, called the showing \u201cdeeply worrying.\u201d \u201cThe big democratic question is the high percentages of Golden Dawn in the municipality of Athens and the Attica prefecture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the urgent duty of all citizens and social forces that believe in democracy and human rights to forcefully fight the fascist-ization of political life.\u201d</p> <p>But political expediency, ahead of Sunday\u2019s runoff local ballot, has resulted in what today\u2019s centre-left Ta Nea described as \u201csurreptitious flirting\u201d with Golden Dawn. Sakellarides, candidate for the vehemently anti-austerity radical left Syriza party in the race for Athens\u2019 Town Hall, has (in a first for the left) gone out of his way to distinguish those who voted for Golden Dawn from the party itself. \u201cWe are not opening up to neo-Nazis \u2026 the 16 % of Athenians who voted for Kasidiaris are not neo-Nazis\u201d he said before appealing to them to \u201cchange their mind\u201d about how they would \u201cprotest about the situation we are living today.\u201d </p> <p>Analysts are now in no doubt that it is the economy that poses the greatest challenge for the government. Despite the encouraging signs Greece has shown of late \u2013 its return to international markets, its improved fiscal figures and attraction of record numbers of tourists \u2013 Golden Dawn has capitalized on the seething resentment and rage of those now wanting to punish a system seen as the genesis of everything that is wrong with Greece. </p> <p>The middle class, which has been brought to its knees by the collapse of small and medium sized businesses, a barrage of taxes and the highest unemployment rate in the EU, has moved shockingly towards Golden Dawn with the governing centre right New Democracy party losing most to the extremists. Despite the imprisonment of a third of its leaders - and a judicial investigation that has focused on its underground activities as a criminal organization \u2013 the neo-fascists took around 9 % nationwide in Sunday\u2019s poll. More shocking still, the group attracted large levels of support in bourgeois areas of the capital such as Kolonaki where backing for the party reached 13.7 %. \u201cGolden Dawn\u2019s appeal is no longer based on the anti-immigrant vote, it\u2019s all about the economy,\u201d said the political commentator Giorgos Kyrtsos, a New Democracy candidate in the upcoming euro elections. \u201cIf there is not a dynamic development of the economy in the next four to five months, after the tourist season, we will be in big, big trouble.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-de7104b0-6afa-4c8a-b72b-90f7ace25584\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/21/1400680422161/5c844b25-b574-44bc-88e6-a96bd80c79ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Posters for the Syriza party in Athens ahead of the European Parliament elections on Thursday and local and regional votes on Sunday.

Consequently, we remain cautious on the strength of the upturn in consumer spending, with household deleveraging and subdued real disposable income growth set to continue to act as restraining factors. </p> <p>So while it is encouraging to see confidence continuing to move in the right direction, this is unlikely to stop the ECB from implementing further easing measures next month. The country breakdown is not yet available for May, but the confidence recovery in the Eurozone has not been confined to Northern European countries. Sentiment in most Southern European countries has also recovered strongly, despite the ongoing high unemployment backdrop.</p> </blockquote> <p>Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Encouraging news for eurozone growth prospects with consumer confidence extending its upward trend in May and rising markedly to be at its highest level since October 2007. This suggests that the Ukraine/Russia crisis has still not worried consumers unduly, although it does appear to have impacted on business confidence in some countries, notably Germany. </p> <p>While the ECB will be encouraged by the marked rise in eurozone consumer confidence in May and may well see it as indicating that modest eurozone recovery remains intact despite disappointing GDP growth of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, it is does not make it any less likely that the ECB will cut all of its interest rates at its June meeting (including taking the deposit rate into negative territory), very possibly as part of a package of stimulative measures aimed at preventing prolonged very low eurozone consumer price inflation and softening the euro.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-537cb1ece4b09fa89997d1c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-21T14:04:04.625Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Back with the eurozone, and consumer confidence for May rose to its highest level in six and a half years.</b></p> <p>The European Commission's first estimate showed a figure of -7.1 points compared to April's revised -8.6 and expectations of an improvement to -8.2.</p> <p>For the whole of the EU, consumer confidence improved by 1.6 points to -4.1.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-537cac5de4b05a73eaef3037\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-21T13:40:16.570Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Axa Investment Managers has become the latest to come out against AstraZeneca's rejection of the \u00a355 a share Pfizer bid.</b></p> <p>Axa owns 4.5% and is the third biggest shareholder in Astra.

On that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Even since European Central Bank president Mario Draghi's press conference earlier this month, there has been much speculation that the central bank will move in June to tackle low inflation, perhaps by cutting interest rates or even some form of quantitative easing. But Bundesbank president and ECB governing council member Jens Weidmann has said it is not clear whether the bank will actually have to act in June. In an interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung due to be published tomorrow (via Reuters) he said the ECB's loose monetary policy stance was appropriate to support the recovery but the risks should be borne in mind. He said: The interest rate policy is the core of our monetary policy instruments. A central banker's attention would certainly focus first on this, if in the end it became necessary to act. But so far it is not clear whether we will have to act at all. Unions representing AstraZeneca's sites in Macclesfield have backed the company's rejection of the Pfizer bid and called for a meeting with chief executive Pascal Soriot to discuss job prospects. A statement from the GMB and Unite shop stewards said: Union representatives expressed full support the AstraZeneca board decision to reject the Pfizer bid. Union representatives call on the board to face down pressure from all quarters to get into negotiations with Pfizer for an agreed bid and to brace to fight any hostile bid. Union representatives are seeking a meeting with Pascal Soriot....to follow up on evidence he gave to the BIS Committee in Parliament on 13 May on job prospects in Astra Zeneca. Oops. AXA Group may own a large chunk of AstraZeneca but AXA Investment Managers - which earlier came out against the board - only has a 0.89% holding. It has just issued a \"clarification\" as follows: In response to a number of enquiries, we would like to emphasise that today\u2019s statement represents the views of AXA Investment Managers UK, which has a 0.89% holding in AstraZeneca. AXA IM UK is part of AXA Group, which in aggregate has a larger holding in AstraZeneca; however this statement has been issued on behalf of AXA IM UK only. Back with AstraZeneca, and here's someone backing the board against the Pfizer bid. Jill Treanor writes: Jeremy Whitley, head of UK and European equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, is supportive of the approach taking by the AstraZeneca board. However he does not rule out Pfizer coming back in the future and makes clear that the Astra board is now under pressure to deliver on its promises.\"We think the Astra board have done a very good job to get the best value they can,\" Whitley said. \"Deep down do we think this is very best offer? [If not] we can be patient\". \"The pressure is now on the AstraZeneca board to deliver,\" he said, adding that the board of the pharmaceuticals company was best placed to put a valuation on its drugs pipeline. The company has used its prediction of $45bn of annual revenues by 2023 as key reason to fend off Pfizer's approach. Over to Greece where the political temperature is rising ahead of a second round of local European elections this weekend. Helena Smith reports: Greece heads to elections this weekend in brittle mood. As Giorgos Kaminis and Gabriel Sakellarides, the two candidates for the Athens mayoralty prepare to face each other in a live debate this evening, it is Golden Dawn, the far right party which has blossomed with the country\u2019s economic crisis, that is dominating events. The extremist group\u2019s surprisingly strong performance in the first round of last Sunday\u2019s local and regional elections \u2013 at 16.1 % its own candidate for mayor Ilias Kasidiaris more than doubled the party\u2019s 6.9% showing in national elections in 2012 \u2013 has sparked concerns across the political spectrum. Deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos, who heads the coalition government\u2019s junior partner, Pasok, called the showing \u201cdeeply worrying.\u201d \u201cThe big democratic question is the high percentages of Golden Dawn in the municipality of Athens and the Attica prefecture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the urgent duty of all citizens and social forces that believe in democracy and human rights to forcefully fight the fascist-ization of political life.\u201d But political expediency, ahead of Sunday\u2019s runoff local ballot, has resulted in what today\u2019s centre-left Ta Nea described as \u201csurreptitious flirting\u201d with Golden Dawn. Sakellarides, candidate for the vehemently anti-austerity radical left Syriza party in the race for Athens\u2019 Town Hall, has (in a first for the left) gone out of his way to distinguish those who voted for Golden Dawn from the party itself. \u201cWe are not opening up to neo-Nazis \u2026 the 16 % of Athenians who voted for Kasidiaris are not neo-Nazis\u201d he said before appealing to them to \u201cchange their mind\u201d about how they would \u201cprotest about the situation we are living today.\u201d Analysts are now in no doubt that it is the economy that poses the greatest challenge for the government. Despite the encouraging signs Greece has shown of late \u2013 its return to international markets, its improved fiscal figures and attraction of record numbers of tourists \u2013 Golden Dawn has capitalized on the seething resentment and rage of those now wanting to punish a system seen as the genesis of everything that is wrong with Greece. The middle class, which has been brought to its knees by the collapse of small and medium sized businesses, a barrage of taxes and the highest unemployment rate in the EU, has moved shockingly towards Golden Dawn with the governing centre right New Democracy party losing most to the extremists. Despite the imprisonment of a third of its leaders - and a judicial investigation that has focused on its underground activities as a criminal organization \u2013 the neo-fascists took around 9 % nationwide in Sunday\u2019s poll. More shocking still, the group attracted large levels of support in bourgeois areas of the capital such as Kolonaki where backing for the party reached 13.7 %. \u201cGolden Dawn\u2019s appeal is no longer based on the anti-immigrant vote, it\u2019s all about the economy,\u201d said the political commentator Giorgos Kyrtsos, a New Democracy candidate in the upcoming euro elections. \u201cIf there is not a dynamic development of the economy in the next four to five months, after the tourist season, we will be in big, big trouble.\u201d The stronger than expected eurozone consumer confidence figures will not necessarily stop the European Central Bank from acting next month, perhaps with an interest rate cut, analysts reckon. Martin van Vliet at ING said: The further brightening in consumers\u2019 economic mood bodes well for consumer spending growth in the second quarter \u2013 and will undoubtedly be greeted with enthusiasm in Brussels ahead of this week's European parliamentary elections. However, consumer spending across the eurozone, albeit improving, has consistently lagged the recovery in consumer confidence in recent quarters. Consequently, we remain cautious on the strength of the upturn in consumer spending, with household deleveraging and subdued real disposable income growth set to continue to act as restraining factors. So while it is encouraging to see confidence continuing to move in the right direction, this is unlikely to stop the ECB from implementing further easing measures next month. The country breakdown is not yet available for May, but the confidence recovery in the Eurozone has not been confined to Northern European countries. Sentiment in most Southern European countries has also recovered strongly, despite the ongoing high unemployment backdrop. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: Encouraging news for eurozone growth prospects with consumer confidence extending its upward trend in May and rising markedly to be at its highest level since October 2007. This suggests that the Ukraine/Russia crisis has still not worried consumers unduly, although it does appear to have impacted on business confidence in some countries, notably Germany. While the ECB will be encouraged by the marked rise in eurozone consumer confidence in May and may well see it as indicating that modest eurozone recovery remains intact despite disappointing GDP growth of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, it is does not make it any less likely that the ECB will cut all of its interest rates at its June meeting (including taking the deposit rate into negative territory), very possibly as part of a package of stimulative measures aimed at preventing prolonged very low eurozone consumer price inflation and softening the euro. Back with the eurozone, and consumer confidence for May rose to its highest level in six and a half years. The European Commission's first estimate showed a figure of -7.1 points compared to April's revised -8.6 and expectations of an improvement to -8.2. For the whole of the EU, consumer confidence improved by 1.6 points to -4.1. Axa Investment Managers has become the latest to come out against AstraZeneca's rejection of the \u00a355 a share Pfizer bid. Axa owns 4.5% and is the third biggest shareholder in Astra. Jim Stride, director and head of UK equities, said: AXA Investment Managers UK, acting in accordance with its fiduciary duty to clients, has met with the management teams of Pfizer and AstraZeneca in the recent past. We have also engaged in ongoing written and verbal communication. It is the view of AXA IM UK that the board of AstraZeneca should not prevent an offer from Pfizer of \u00a355 per share from being put to the shareholders of the company. Many shareholders \u2013 but not necessarily all \u2013 will find this an attractive offer. Accordingly we believe that the board was arguably wrong and acted too hastily to dismiss the latest proposal from Pfizer. Saga has cut its flotation price range following the closure of the retail offer on Tuesday. The company, which provides insurance and holidays for the over-50s, said the range would now be 185p to 245p a share, compared to the original top end of 245p. This is apparently to support \"a strong debut.\" Adam Jepsen, Director, Capital Spreads, said: Capital Spreads earlier this week reported a fall in the grey market price for Saga. Director Adam Jepsen said: We have seen a fairly significant fall on our grey market \u2013 Saga has gone from a valuation of \u00a33.25bn to around \u00a32.4bn in the space of a week. This is not so much a reflection of concerns over Saga\u2019s attractiveness as an investment, but more an issue around the number of shares on offer. Based on the 1.07bn shares due to be issued, according to the listing documents, and on the assumption that all shares are equal, on Capital Spreads\u2019 current spread the share price would be between 210p and 238p at the end of the first day\u2019s trading. Reuters has polled City economists and found that the \"vast majority\" believe the European Central Bank will cut its headline borrowing rate to a new record low of 0.1% at its June meeting. Most also expect the ECB will impose negative interest rates on European banks, by cutting its deposit rate from 0.0% to -0.1%.

Nick Fletcher has the controls...) Another day, another recall at General Motors. Associated Press is reporting that GM has added 218,000 subcompact cars to its growing list of recalled vehicles -- to fix a glitch that could lead to a fire. The new recall covers certain Chevrolet Aveo cars from the 2004 through 2008 model years. GM says the daytime running light module in the dashboard center stack can overheat, melt and cause fires. Yesterday, GM recalled 2.4 million vehicles -- today's news means the number of cars called back to have problems fixed has hit 13.8 million in 2014 alone. Today could be dubbed Minutes Wednesday - with the US Federal Reserve releasing the notes from its own monetary policy committee meeting later today (7pm UK time, or 2pm New York). The FOMC minutes will give fesh insight into when US borrowing costs might rise. Analysts at RANsquawk reckon we'll hear that \"a range of views\" were expressed (rather like at the Bank of England). Their video preview explains all: After almost a year, Mark Carney's honeymoon at the Bank of England is well and truly over, with senior policymakers prepared to disagree over how to tackle monetary policy. The minutes of this month's meeting show MPC members had the resolve to express \"a variety of views on the appropriate path of monetary policy\". Writing in the Times (\u00a3, sorry), Phillip Aldrick argues that Carney is now in new territory. Dissent is back at the Bank: A ten-month unconditional love-in with the new Bank of England governor appears to have been all Britain\u2019s independent rate-setters could stomach. The unity of the nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee is finally beginning to crack. But as he concludes, argument is a good thing: The fact that there is a real debate once again over the most critical policy instrument in the UK should be celebrated. Reminder, the minutes are online here (pdf). MPC members are now freer to think for themselves because the UK unemployment rate has fallen below 7%. That's the level Carney identified as a threshold last August in his first stab at forward guidance (now torn up and replaced with a woollier policy based on guessing how much slack remains in the labour market). Here's economics editor Larry Elliott's take on this morning's strong retail sales figure: Britain's retailers are enjoying their best trading conditions for a decade after low interest rates, rising confidence, a booming housing market and a late Easter boosted spending in the shops and online last month.... UK retailers buoyed by best trading conditions in a decade The cutbacks in Britain's banking sector continues --with Lloyds eliminating another 645 roles in the UK and closing its Warrington telephone banking centre. The Unite union warns that staff morale could hit an 'all-time low', as this is the third round of job losses in 2014. It urges Lloyds to avoid compulsory job losses. Unite national officer Rob MacGregor warned that Lloyds customers could also suffer from the cuts: \u201cThe closure of the Warrington centre will hit the local economy and risks damaging customer service. \u201cLloyds staff have worked hard since it was bailed out by the taxpayer to make the bank a success. Their reward has been continual uncertainty and attacks on their pensions. \u201cLloyds needs to give its workforce stability and guarantees of no compulsory redundancies. Only then will the bank be able to live up to its motto to \u2018Make Britain Prosper\u2019.\u201d The Wall Street Journal has now published the story about how Legal &amp; General has written to AstraZeneca to call for fresh talks with Pfizer (as flagged at 11.31am). Legal &amp; General Urges AstraZeneca to Engage With Pfizer AstraZeneca sixth-largest investor, Legal &amp; General Group PLC, is urging the U.K. drug giant's board to reverse its rejection of a $120 billion takeover offer from Pfizer and engage in talks, two people familiar with the situation said. The investment arm of the U.K. insurer, which holds a 3.5% stake in AstraZeneca, has written to the company's board asking it to engage in talks with Pfizer, one of the people said. Legal &amp; General declined to comment. AstraZeneca declined to comment on individual shareholder interactions but said it is continuing to engage in general with its investors. Legal &amp; General joins AXA, Schroders, and Jupiter Fund Management as large AstraZeneca investors that have publicly expressed disappointment at its rejection of the offer. Combined, they hold around 7% of the stock. More here. Astra shares are currently 1.5% higher, at \u00a343.77. After years of relative tedium, the Bank of England's monthly monetary policy committee meetings are going to be a lot more exciting as pressure grows to raise rates. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, says there are \"emerging signs of disagreement in April\u2019s meeting\" in today's BoE minutes. \u201cThe debate on interest rates looks set to become more heated. According to the latest minutes of the MPC, while the Committee remained unanimous in favour of keeping policy of hold, there were a variety of views on the appropriate path of monetary policy. For some members the decision to keep rates unchanged was becoming \u2018more balanced\u2019. That said, with prospects for inflation looking very benign and the economy, in our view, possessing a significant amount of spare capacity, we still think that a rate rise will not happen until well into 2015.\" AstraZeneca shares have leading the FTSE 100 risers, gaining 1.8% this morning to \u00a343.83. The trigger appears to be a report that one of Astra's biggest shareholders, Legal &amp; General, has written to the company's board urging them to re-open talks with Pfizer over its \u00a355 per share offer. It's being attributed to Dow Jones Newswires - I've not managed to find it myself, yet, I'm afraid. We just spoke to L&amp;G and they declined to comment.... (as reported at 10.40am, Threadneedle Asset Management have told us they support Astra's board today) There's masses of reaction to the surge in UK retail sales last month, and the evidence that some Bank of England policymakers are inching towards raising interest rates. Many experts are pondering what its means for borrowing costs - when will rates be risen above the 0.5% record low? Heres some of the best comment out there: James Knightley of ING: With the growth story broadening out we are getting closer to a rate rise from the Bank of England. Our house view remains that the first hike will probably come in February, but given the strength in growth, employment and asset prices the risks are skewed towards a slightly earlier move. If we see wages growth pick up \u2013 note the impending 3% rise in national minimum wage and the increase in reported pay awards \u2013 then we would be more inclined to bring it forward. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank says today' minutes are 'less dovish', and could herald a rate rise before Christmas Retail sales posted an exceptionally strong 6.9% yoy growth rate in April. That was obviously distorted by the timing of Easter, so the growth rate will drop back sharply next month. But the reading was way ahead of consensus expectations. These data support our forecasts for above consensus growth and a first rate hike coming in the first quarter of 2015. We see a 35% chance that the BoE hikes in the fourth quarter of 2014. The UK economy is motoring, fuelled for now by consumption, and the BoE rate setters are shifting their views in response. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, agrees we could see an interest rate rise before Christmas. Here's why: UK Retail Sales have yet again beaten expectations with a month-on-month jump of 1.3%, far exceeding the forecast of 0.4%. All stores except petrol stations have seen an increase in sales with April \u201914 showing an increase of 6.9% from April \u201913. With UK house prices continuing to rise and CPI starting to accelerate, the MPC may be forced to bring forward an interest rate rise to Q4 2014. February 2015 is a popular bet: Analysts at Abshire-Smith say: Traders have been betting that the BoE will be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected, as the economic growth begins to pick up pace and to cool a potential property bubble. But Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons it's \"far from clear\" when rates will rise. One reson - the committee is changing this summer (when Nemat Shafik and Kristin Forbes join the MPC) The outlook for monetary policy is starting to look a lot more uncertain, with the minutes of the May MPC meeting indicating that opinions within the committee are diverging on about exactly when monetary policy should start to be gradually tightened. There are clear indications in the May minutes that some of the more hawkish MPC members are starting to get twitchy. The longer-term message from the Bank of England remains that when interest rates do start to rise, the increases will be gradual and limited, but when exactly the first increase comes is far from clear. As recriminations fly over Pfizer's failing bid for AstraZeneca, one of the UK drugs firm's larger shareholders has told the Guardian that they still support Astra's top management. Iain Richards, head of responsible investment at Threadneedle Asset Management, said: \"As long-term shareholders we continue to be supportive of the AstraZeneca board\". Threadneedle has a 1.5% stake in the company - making it Astra's 15th-largest shareholder. Last night, AstraZeneca issued a statement to the City insisting that Pfizer's \u00a355 per share 'final' offer cannot be raised again, with or without Astra's approval. Yesterday, Schroders expressed 'disappointment' with both companies, but other shareholders -- such as Neil Woodford -- have backed Astra. There's still talk of rebellion in the air, though.... (with thanks to City editor Jill Treanor) Britain's retailers have just enjoyed their strongest quarterly growth in a decade, according to the detail in today's retail sales figures. The amount of goods purchased increasing by 1.8% in the three months to April, on a rolling 3-month to 3-month basis. That's the highest reading since March 2004 and was the 14th consecutive month of three-month-on-three month growth in the quantity of goods bought. That driven by the 6.9% annual surge in April (as flagged at 9.39am). The ONS said that all stores, apart from petrol stations, enjoyed a rise in sales volumes. Notably the food sector posted its strongest year-on-year growth since January 2002, increasing by 6.3%. Feedback from food store retailers suggested that a better than expected Easter and better weather conditions helped to boost sales. Analysts at Berenberg reckon that today's minutes play a different tune than the Bank of England governor sang at the quarterly inflation report last week: Last Wednesday, governor Mark Carney played down the idea of a rate-rise before next May's election. Today's Bank of England minutes show that some members of its rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee are looking at the strong recovery and wondering if it's nearly time to raise interest rates. The minutes of May's meeting of the MPC are online here. They explain that the decision over whether to raise borrowing costs is becoming \"more balanced\" for some of the nine-strong committee. The Bank's view is that rates will only rise \"gradually and to a level materially below its pre-crisis average\". Some on the committee are wondering whether, in that case, they should start raising them sooner rather than later. Others are more focused on whether an early rate rise would cause long-term damage to the economy. As the minutes put it: It could be argued that the more gradual the intended rise in Bank Rate, the earlier it might be necessary to start tightening policy. Against that, if productive potential were in part related to the level of demand, then the earlier policy was tightened the greater the risk of incurring a substantial cost in foregone output. Committee members placed different weights on these considerations and this was reflected in a variety of views on the appropriate path of monetary policy. The Committee would continue to refine its views as the economy evolved, and for some members the monetary policy decision was becoming more balanced. However, the MPC remained united - saying that while there are no other inflationary pressures to worry about, they will wait to see \"more evidence of slack* reducing\" before raising rates. * - spare capacity in the labour market This chart shows how the pound just jumped against the US dollar, driven by the jump in retail sales, and the news that some Bank of England policymakers are moving closer to voting to raise interest rates. UK retail sales have surged in April, and by more than expected, in another signal that the British economy remains strong. Retail sales volumes jumped by 1.3% last month alone, twice as much as economists had forecast, driven by robust food sales over the Easter holidays. That means sales volumes were 6.9% higher than in April 2012. The late Easter (it fell in March last year) was expected to push up demand at retailers - but not by this much... The pound has jumped, hitting a two-week high of $1.6922 against the US dollar. And it hit a new 16-month high against the euro, of 81.03p. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted 9-0 to leave interest rates at their record low of 0.5% at this month's meeting, minutes just released show. But some members believed the decision on when to raise rates is \"becoming more balanced\" - a sign that some MPC members are turning more hawkish about the need to raise borrowing costs. More to follow! The dividend paid to SSE shareholders has been rising steadily over the last 15 years, flags up Emily Gosden of the Telegraph. Indeed. it's more than tripled -- from 25.7p in 1999 to 86.7p for last year. And she's not convinced by the argument that last winter's price hike didn't help drive profits up: Nearly time for the latest Bank of England minutes, and the retail sales figures for April, at 9.30am. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale reckons retail sales picked up last month, partly due to the Easter holidays: The late timing of Easter caused UK retail sales to be weak in March. So a rebound in April is likely. We're looking for a 0.6% bounce and for a lack of thrills from the MPC Minutes. Shares in French bank BNP Paribas have slipped 2% this morning, on reports that it's about to feel the full wrath of US regulators. Bloomberg is reporting that US authorities are planning to impose $5bn in fines, and a temporary ban on transferring money in and out of America, for violating US sanctions. The bank had previously said it expected a fine of at least $1bn, with analysts pencilling in a $3bn penalty. A block on money transfers, if only temporary, could have serious consequences for BNPP. \u201cWhen your client has to go to a rival bank to get the most basic banking service, even for a few months, you\u2019ll lose them,\u201d Fred Cannon, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, told Bloomberg. Back on SSE's results, and the Press Association has focused on the drop in retail profits at the energy supplier: Energy giant SSE today said annual profits from its energy supply arm fell by nearly a third and are unlikely to recover for two years after it announced a price freeze. Operating profits from the business dropped by 32.2% to \u00a3246 million though the wider group saw adjusted pre-tax profits rise 9.6% to \u00a31.55 billion. SSE said its energy supply arm was hit by lower use of energy by customers during a mild winter and a higher cost of gas. The group pledged earlier this year to freeze household gas and electricity tariffs until January 2016, but said this did not impact on the latest annual figures, for the year to the end of March. SSE made the promise a day before regulator Ofgem announced plans to refer the energy sector for a full-scale competition probe. Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said the pledge had been \"hugely popular\". \"It remains the only such commitment available to customers and will mean we take a hit on retail profits over the next couple of years,\" he added. It's the end of an era at Carpetright. The UK flooring firm's (very) long-serving executive chairman, Lord Harris, is stepping down this summer, after more than half a century in carpet retailing. Lord Harris explains it is time to step aside: \"I will be 72 this year and shareholders will be aware that I have been planning a managed hand-over of my responsibilities for some time. Wilf Walsh, the former CEO of Coral, is taking over. But Martin Harris, Lord Harris's son, is stepping down as Group Development Director to pursue other interests, having once looked like the heir apparent at the company.... Heads-up for eurozone crisis watchers - the FT's Peter Spiegel is about to discuss his brilliant series on how the euro was saved, on Radio 4. You'll be able to hear it later on iPlayer (could be tricky if you're not in the UK, though).. SSE's 9.6% jump in profits (despite that drop in retail earnings) haven't caused any alarm in the City -- where shares have dipped just 0.3%, or 6p, to \u00a315.60. And Burberry's record profits have also gone down well - shares are up 0.6% Burberry's new boss, Christopher Bailey, has begun his stint at the top of the fashion industry by reporting record profits for the last year, up 8% rise in line with expectations. But Burberry also warned (again) that adverse currency movements are going to wipe millions of pounds off its revenues this year. If the pound remains at its current level against the yen, Burberry's licensing revenue will be reduced by about \u00a310m, it predicted. Sterling has gained 10% against the yen since last May, but broadly flat this year. Bailey, who also remains as Burberry's chief creative officer, also warned of \"macroeconomic uncertainties\", but remains upbeat: As we enter a new chapter, our teams are united and energised by the opportunities ahead - from unlocking Japan, to accelerating Beauty and further integrating the physical and digital to deliver distinctive experiences. SSE has hiked the dividend it pays to shareholders by 3.0% -- part of its policy to raise dividends at least as fast as inflation. But it warned that future earnings face several risks, including: the possibility of a freeze on retail energy prices being legislated upon in Great Britain after the 2015 general election; ....as the Labour party has pledged if it forms the next government. SSE's chairman Lord Smith insists that his company is part of the solution, not the problem, in the energy sector - after growing profits by almost 10% in the last year: \"SSE is listening to and helping customers with the longest ever household energy price freeze in the Great Britain market;we have well-defined plans for net investment of around \u00a35.5bn over the next four years in maintaining, upgrading and building the electricity assets customers depend on; and we are committed to giving investors a fair return through an annual dividend that at least keeps pace with inflation. \"The issues facing the energy sector are very challenging. Nevertheless, customers, investors, regulators, politicians and SSE all want the same thing: an energy market that works for customers, and is trusted and seen to do so. We believe SSE is not part of the problem but part of the solution to meeting the energy needs of customers in Great Britain and Ireland.\" Energy firm SSE has reignited the debate over the state of Britain's energy sector by posting a 9.6% surge in profits for the last financial year. SSE, one of Britain's \"Big Six\" suppliers, made adjusted pre-tax profits of\u00a31.55bn for the year to 31 March compared with \u00a31.4bn a year earlier. Operatinng profits at its wholesale division jumped almost 25%, while retail operating profits actually fell by 28.6%. SSE blamed the \"relatively mild winter in 2013/14\" for its fall in retail profits; temperatures were warmer, and snowfalls were largely confined to the Scottish mountains. But the company, which recently froze its prices until 2016, also shed around 370,000 customers last year. The total number of accounts fell to 9.1 million, from 9.47 million a year ago. And has the Telegraph points out, these figures show the energy sector remains a profitable place to operate: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Coming up today -- the minutes of the Bank of England's last monetary policy meeting will show whether any rate-setters are considering raising interest rates, in the face of a growing economy and hefty house price rises in London. In the corporate world, we're getting results from energy firm SSE and fashion house Burberry, how under the control of Chris Bailey (who picked up a \u00a37.6m golden hello last week). We'll be mopping up reaction to a big speech by the Greek prime minister last night, in which he claimed the country will have clawed its way back to its pre-crisis level by the end of the decade. Not everyone's convinced: And speaking of the eurozone, former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi held a jaw-dropping interview with Newsnight last night - in which he denied insulting Angela Merkel and defended his various legal charges (and convictions). Berlusconi also blasted the radical Italian politician Beppe Grillo, claiming he had \"things in common with Robespierre, Stalin and Pol Pot\". Paxman, interviewing Berlusconi, looked quite bewildered by it all... I'll be tracking all the key developments through the day...",

McFarlane, a former banker who also chairs Aviva, has brought in Warwick Brady, easyJet's chief operating officer; Drummond Hall, senior independent director at WH Smith; and Imelda Walsh, who chairs the remuneration committees at William Hill, Mitchells &amp; Butlers and Mothercare. They will replace Sievwright, Begg and Colin Hood on the board next month. The board has been under pressure over FirstGroup's performance, which McFarlane said had disappointed shareholders. Thomas Sandell, a US activist investor, has accused directors of being complacent in rejecting his calls to break up the company. McFarlane said he thought FirstGroup's strategy was broadly correct but that selling businesses was an option to get the group to a stronger financial position. Chief executive Tim O'Toole said he understood why his chairman, who ousted Andrew Moss as Aviva's chief executive, had criticised FirstGroup's past performance. \"I'm working very well with John. John is very keen to be candid with the market and to set expectations at the right level. I accept his candour. I think it is very helpful and it helps in dealing with the City. \"John is pointing out that we are trying to be prudent in our approach and not let shareholder payouts get out of line with the trajectory of the business. That was his view, that in the past that had been a problem and he isn't going to go there again.\" Asked if he thought his job was in jeopardy after nearly four years at the helm, the former boss of London Underground said: \"I've been open about the challenges FirstGroup has faced to rebuild First Student and the UK bus operation and I'm anxious to complete the challenge.\" FirstGroup's plans were further derailed in 2012 when the UK government revoked a decision to award it the lucrative contract to run the west coast mainline rail franchise between London and Scotland after a botched bidding process. O'Toole said the group was working on an attractive bid for the east coast rail franchise. FirstGroup shares fell 0.9% to 133.4p.",

      "bodyText": "Lord Harris of Peckham is to step down as chairman of Carpetright, the chain he founded from a single store in east London in 1988. Harris, who is 72, will hand over running the struggling business to new chief executive Wilf Walsh in July. He will retire from the board at September's annual general meeting but will stay on as an adviser to Walsh. Harris has been executive chairman of Carpetright since November when former chief executive Darren Shapland left after a profit warning. He was chief executive for 24 years until 2011 after building the flooring group into one of Britain's biggest retailers. His family owns about 20% of the company. Harris said. \"It's been a long while. I was asked to come back and I've enjoyed what I've done. We said we were looking for a new chief executive and we didn't know how long it would take and we've found the right person. \"Wilf has asked me to be an adviser to them one, two or three days a week so I'm not leaving completely. I'm a hands-on person and my best job is not as chairman.\" Walsh joins from Fortuna Entertainment, a betting group in central Europe, where he is chairman. His previous jobs include eight years as managing director of Coral, the bookmaker, and six years running HMV's German business. When Harris resumed running Carpetright he pledged to get a grip on the business and turn around its loss-making Dutch division. A succession of profit warnings followed as the business in the Netherlands struggled and the group failed to benefit from the resurgent UK housing market. Carpetright was also forced to adjust its pricing policies after the Office for Trading criticised it and other floor and furniture sellers for misleading consumers. Harris said Carpetright was now turning the corner and that store revamps in the UK were paying off. \"I think it's in a good state. We've done 260 of our stores and they are looking good. The market is slightly improving. Europe has been our problem and we have put a new managing director out there. He's doing a great job and you will see a much better result in the next 12 months.\" Harris, whose family's estimated wealth is \u00a3160m, made his first fortune in the carpet business when he sold Harris Queensway in 1988, reaping \u00a369m. He is a regular donor to the Conservative party and has spent millions of pounds to support education projects in the UK, including the Harris Federation, which operates 27 primary and secondary schools in and around London. After selling Harris Queensway, he opened the first branch of Carpetright in Canning Town, London. By the end of 1990 Carpetright had 71 stores and in 1993 the company floated on the stock market. In 2002, Harris expanded in the Netherlands and Belgium because they were similar markets to the UK. But the Dutch business has weighed Carpetright down after the bursting of one of Europe's biggest real estate bubbles. Some analysts also say that the core UK business needs an overhaul because it has too much retail space for the size of the market. Carpetright is looking for a new chairman. If a replacement is not found by September's AGM its deputy chairman, Baroness Noakes, will stand in. Harris said he would be paid as an adviser to Walsh but that the amount had not been agreed. \"I've never been a person who has robbed the company of money and I'm not going to start now,\" he said. Harris's son Martin, who is group development director, will also leave the company in September after 23 years. Chief operating officer Graham Harris, who is not a relation of Lord Harris, has left after seven months because his job will be redundant once Walsh joins. Carpetright's financial year ended on 26 April and it is due to post full-year results on 24 June.",

      "bodyText": "Burberry's new chief executive Christopher Bailey promised to lead the company in \"my own way\", as the British luxury brand reported record results. The 158-year old company best known for its camel-coloured trenchcoats and check pattern said revenues were up 17% to \u00a32.3bn, in a year when it continued to open new shops, including its first dedicated makeup and perfume shop in London. Adjusted profits rose 8% to \u00a3461m. Burberry said it was looking to Japan, the world's second largest luxury goods market, and its growing beauty business to further boost its business. The FTSE-100-listed company also announced that easyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall will join its board as a non-executive director from 1 September. Bailey, who took over as chief executive on 1 May, and continues in his role as Burberry's chief designer, said the group had shown \"outstanding brand momentum during the year\". In a nod to investor concerns about combining two jobs and his limited boardroom experience, he acknowledged \"my new role is an unconventional role and my background is not one of a traditional CEO\". Dressed in an open-necked shirt without a tie while speaking to an audience of investors, he said: \"I will lead Burberry in my own way.\" In a speech more evocative of the boardroom than the catwalk he spoke of \"underpenetrated markets\" \u2013 Burberry would like to sell more menswear \u2013 as well as \"currency headwinds\". The latter point reflects the problem fluctuating exchange rates pose for the international business: Wednesday's reported profits could have been \u00a350m lower if based on current rates. But the company declined to answer questions on Bailey's pay package, following a Guardian report that he had been handed a golden hello in shares worth up to \u00a37.6m. Bailey's pay package is worth up to \u00a38.1m a year, including a \u00a3440,000 cash allowance for clothing and other items, which is \u00a354,000 more than his predecessor Angela Ahrendts received. Shareholders often protest about big rewards for internal promotions, but Burberry's chief financial officer Carol Fairweather said the chief executive's pay was a matter for Burberry's remuneration committee: \"It is not for me to comment on Christopher's pay; that is a conversation for the Rem Co.\" Fairweather said there would be \"absolutely no change in strategy\" under Bailey, who had been instrumental in setting the company's direction in his past six years as chief creative officer and in 13 years at the company. Burberry has been preparing to scale up its presence in Japan for five years to take advantage of the world's second-largest luxury goods market behind the US The company said that its four shops and 10 concessions in Japan had shown the strongest comparative sales across the group in the past two years. \"Our peers generate 10% of their global revenue in Japan while we are scarcely playing there,\" said Pascal Perrier, Burberry's Asia Pacific chief executive. The group also plans to expand its beauty business and confirmed that it was hoping to enter the \u00a326bn skincare market by late 2015. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said the company appeared to be moving in the right direction following a profits warning in its last financial year. \"It is still to some extent a jam tomorrow stock. We are still waiting to see whether the prospects for the company for next year come good.\"",

Oriel Securities analyst Chris Wickham issued a buy note: This is a good set of numbers and with a strong start to the second half, we are comfortable with a forecast at the top of the company's full year guidance range of \u00a3148m to \u00a3156m. While the tax charge may be half a point higher than envisaged, earnings per share growth close to 20% is still possible in 2014. Trading at discounts to its chief UK soft drinks peers and the international group, Britvic's shares should clearly be bought.",

The gains come after a well received analyst day on Tuesday where the company - which reported disappointing first quarter results last month due to lower than expected royalty revenues - gave a positive outlook for the rest of the year. Analysts at Credit Suisse said:</p> <blockquote> At its analyst day in London, Arm maintained its near term and long term targets: <br> i) around 19% growth in royalties for 2014 (same as last three years' average) with pick up in the second half after weakness in the first quarter;  ii) smartphone/tablet royalties to grow in the range of 15%-25% over the next 5 years;  iii) around 15 percentage points of outperformance in royalty growth versus semi industry revenues (similar to last 5 years);  iv) licensing revenue to grow at around 10% compound annual growth rate over time (but higher near term). Overall we continue to believe that Arm can deliver 17%/14% compound annual growth rate for top-line over 2013-2016, with earnings per share growing at 23% compound annual growth rate, and hence reiterate our outperform rating. </blockquote> <p>Jefferies analyst Lee Simpson said:</p> <blockquote> Arm's analyst day saw the firm focus on three key areas - mobile, embedded and networking/servers - with the silicon total available market for each estimated at $20bn by 2018. Arm sees market share grow materially in the last two and expect the use of ARMv8 to be almost ubiquitous in handsets by 2018. We see the Computex Fair in Taipei (3 to 6 June) as the next share catalyst. <br> Addressing the 4bn without a smartphone in the next 5 years. Arm talks about the cascade of functions from high-end handsets to mid-to-low end as an on-going design dynamic \u2013 in this way much of what is seen in the high-end processing today could be bettered by the low-end in 2018.  Royalties outperformance to continue. The semi industry typically grows at 3%-5% compound annual growth rate (dollar sales). This has slowed to about 1.5% in recent years as spending recovery from the credit crunch low has yet to grow back to historical levels. Arm's dollar-royalty compound annual growth rate meanwhile has been 17%, which points to a 15% points outperformance. The firm remains confident that given (i) rising royalty rates (ARMv8 rises in mix), (ii) growth in end markets (e.g. smartphone unit growth of around 10%) and (iii) market share gains in new end markets (e.g. rising to around 10% by the end of 2014 in networking) that this level of outperformance in royalties can continue. We estimate a processor division royalties compound annual growth of around 17% this year. This should grow faster next year as v8 in smartphones becomes more widespread. </blockquote> <p>Deutsche Bank however kept its hold rating:</p> <blockquote> [Arm's share] valuation has become somewhat less demanding. Yet, it remains at the higher end of the... range it traded until mid 2012, before management raised its royalty outperformance target to 15%-20%. With management now toning down the royalty outperformance message again and little near-term positive catalysts ahead, we retain hold. <br> </blockquote> <p>And Liberum, a consistent seller of the shares, has not changed its recommendation:</p> <blockquote> At ARM's investor day yesterday management presented a bullish outlook for the company's future market share in network infrastructure (ex-servers). From a share of about 5% in 2013, it targets a penetration of over 30% by 2018, with 60% penetration in mobile infrastructure. On an overall basis Arm expects to grow its volume market share of the overall semiconductor market from the 35% achieved in 2013. This in turn, is expected to result in its royalty revenue growing at about 15 percentage points ahead of the industry. We continue to be more cautious on Arm's royalty progression over the next five years, mainly due to the on-going mix shift in the smartphone and tablet markets towards the low end, and the relatively small contributions expected from new product segments. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has slipped 4.83 points to 6797.17, with <strong>Morrisons</strong> leading the way lower.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The row over high energy prices was reignited on Wednesday after Britain's second largest supplier reported annual profits of more than \u00a31.5bn. SSE said the 9.6% year-on-year increase had largely come from its wholesale not its retail business but critics described the figures as a \"kick in the teeth\" for consumers. And there was embarrassment for energy regulator with figures showing that SSE's electricity transmission business which is overseen by Ofgem recorded an almost 50% rise in profits to \u00a3137m. The company, formerly Scottish &amp; Southern Energy, raised prices last November by more than 8% allowing it to record profits of \u00a3300m in its retail business, down 28%, as it lost more than 350,000 of its 9.4 million customers. Alistair Phillips-Davies, SSE chief executive, put the \u00a31.55bn group profits down to significant investment in gas production and electricity networks, and said it was doing all it could to hold retail prices. \"We introduced our price freeze right at the end of the last financial year and it has been hugely popular. It remains the only such commitment available to all customers and will mean we take a hit on retail profits over the next couple of years.\" The energy company has frozen prices to households until 2016 which, it said, would knock \u00a3100m off future earnings but has continued to reward investors with a 3% rise in the dividend for the year ending 31 March, 2014. Critics were quick to attack the company. \"SSE's announcement of a \u00a31.55bn profit is a kick in the teeth for consumers when their prices went up by 8.2% last year. So we're stunned that they've announced a massive profits increase of 9.6% after losing 370,000 customers in the past year,\" said Jonathan Senior, head of research at collective switching and low energy campaign, ThisIsTheBigDeal.com. \"When SSE announced a price freeze in March, we said it was cynical to offer a freeze when prices are unaffordable. We stand by that. And in light of today's announcement, we're calling on SSE to put the customer first and turn their profit windfall into a price cut.\" Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, said the SSE figures showed the energy companies had increased their profits on the back of spiralling bills and a cost of living crisis for hard-pressed consumers. \"SSE has already said it will freeze prices until 2016. Today's profits show it can afford to freeze them until 2017 \u2013 and if SSE can do it, so can the other energy companies.\" The annual figures from SSE show that its \"upstream\" business has seen a one-off gain of \u00a390m profit from the purchase of a North Sea gas field. Without that extra money the wholesale operation would have reported flat earnings, said the company. SSE was keen to point out that it invested \u00a31.58bn over the last 12 months on upgrading the country's energy infrastructure, more than it reaped in profits. This week a report commissioned from accountant, PwC, showed that overall SSE had contributed through tax and other benefits more than \u00a39.1bn to the UK economy over the last 12 months. But these arguments did little to dent the anger from the critics. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said he welcomed the certainty offered by SSE's energy price freeze at a time when many suppliers were basing bill increases on rising wholesale prices. \"Now, with healthy group profits and wholesale gas prices falling, we expect SSE to promise not just to shield people from price increases but to fairly pass on lower costs to their customers.\" And another group, Fuel Poverty Action, said reporting huge profits at a time when millions were struggling to pay their bills showed expressions of regret about past price rises were nothing but hot air. \"It's time to acknowledge that the big six will always put their lust for profit first and that until we have a not-for-profit, renewable energy system owned by the public and by communities the likes of SSE will continue to make a killing.\"",
