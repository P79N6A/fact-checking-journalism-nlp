      "bodyText": "How would you like to earn a return of up to 6% on your cash while at the same time providing families in countries such as Kenya with \u201clife-changing\u201d access to clean, affordable solar energy? Energise Africa is a new ethical investment scheme which aims to raise \u00a320m to provide a brighter future for more than 110,000 families and small businesses in sub-Saharan Africa over the next three years. Investors will find some reassurance that it is supported by UK aid money from the Department for International Development (DfID). And what is also notable is that, unusually, some of the investments on offer benefit from what is known as \u201cfirst loss cover\u201d \u2013 which means that if the worst were to happen, and the company was unable to pay back what it owed, individual investors would be prioritised ahead of DfID, thereby providing an extra level of protection. With a minimum investment of \u00a350, it is a potentially straightforward and accessible way for people to make sure their money is doing some good. However, this is not risk-free, and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there was some kind of disaster/crisis/bankruptcy, you could lose some or all your capital, and you would not be able to get redress from the UK\u2019s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, so you need to go into this with your eyes open. Currently 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live without access to electricity. For example, in Uganda, the figure is just 7% of rural families. Many use traditional energy sources such as kerosene lamps, candles and batteries for their energy needs \u2013 but these can be extremely hazardous, as well as costly. Lamps and candles have been responsible for many house fires, while soot and fumes can cause health problems. Having a solar system can transform people\u2019s lives in so many ways \u2013 allowing children to read and study in the evening, enabling families to charge their mobile phones, or enabling a stallholder to install a fridge so they can sell cold drinks. Energise Africa is an initiative that provides working capital to businesses that sell solar home systems, the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform. It was \u201csoft launched\u201d in the summer and is also being backed by Virgin Unite, the non-profit foundation of the Virgin Group. So what\u2019s the deal? This involves investing in unsecured bonds that are not listed on a public market in return for an expected 4% to 6% annual return. Basically, you are lending money to businesses that sell small solar systems to families throughout sub-Saharan Africa. UK investors can deposit small or large sums in one or more projects, and the term of the investment is typically either two or three years. Once the project is fully funded, the money is transferred to the solar business. Every six months investors will receive both interest and a capital repayment from their chosen business. The loans provided to the businesses are then used to buy solar home systems, which are then sold to African families via a financing plan. Typically, a family makes monthly payments over 12 to 24 months, and then owns the system outright. At the time of writing there were two projects open for investment, both of them featured on the Lendahand.co.uk website and benefiting from match funding. One, from Dutch firm SolarWorks!, is looking to raise \u00a390,000, and is a three-year bond where the expected interest rate is 6% a year. This project aims to provide clean energy to 1,000 families in Mozambique, and there is the added advantage of \u00a345,000 of first-loss cover from DfID. \u201cIn the unlikely event that SolarWorks! Trading BV was unable to make all of its bond repayments, the crowd would be prioritised ahead of repayment to UK aid,\u201d says the Lendahand site. The other project is a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 5% a year but no first loss cover. The company behind this is a UK one, Azuri, which has its HQ in Cambridge, and has set an investment target of \u00a3200,000. It says every \u00a3100 invested will allow Azuri to make a solar home system available to a rural family in Tanzania that would otherwise be out of their financial reach. This project benefits from match funding to the tune of an upfront \u00a3100,000 of DfID aid money. In June, Lisa Ashford, a director at Lendahand Ethex, travelled to Mpigi in Uganda, where she met families and visited schools, orphanages and businesses, all whom were now using solar. She says one of the most striking things was the demand for education. \u201cThe desire to study hard and succeed was very apparent across the classes we visited at Lumuza school. The children were still doing prep in the evening under the solar lights across the classrooms. Without the solar I\u2019m not sure how they would have all have managed to work so hard.\u201d The team also met Patience, who runs a small local store that provides her with income to look after her young family. Since getting solar, she has installed fridges, so she can sell cold drinks and refrigerated food without high bills or power cuts. Those who sign up will be able to benefit from tax-free returns by holding their investment within an \u201cinnovative finance\u201d Isa \u2013 the new account for debt-based crowd funding and peer-to-peer loans. But it\u2019s vital to read up on the risks, which could include everything from potential political instability in the country concerned to a natural disaster such as a flood or famine. \u2022 Fancy earning a potential 15% a year from turning whisky into motor fuel? It sounds fanciful to say the least, but this is a genuine investment offer, with multimillion-pound backing from the Scottish government. But that sky-high rate gives you an indication that this is a whole lot riskier than putting your money into a savings account, with no compensation if things go wrong, so this definitely isn\u2019t the place to stash your entire life savings. A Scottish startup, Celtic Renewables Ltd, has secured planning permission to build a plant at Grangemouth that will produce biobutanol, a sustainable biofuel made using whisky residue that, according to the firm, is a direct replacement for petrol and diesel. The plant will cost just over \u00a320m to build, almost half of which is coming from the Scottish government in the form of a \u00a39m grant. The firm is looking to raise up to \u00a34.375m via a two-year investment available via the ethical investment platform Abundance. It is offering 15% interest a year, with the capital and interest paid at maturity in December 2019. Those who invest would be buying debentures, which are like IOUs issued by companies. However, the offer document outlines five pages of risks - for example, debentures are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service. \u201cPart or all of your original invested capital may be at risk,\u201d and returns are not guaranteed.",

      "bodyText": "Poundland faces potential difficulties with suppliers after an insurance company reduced its cover on credit for those selling goods to the cut price chain. The credit insurer Atradius reduced its cover relating to stock sold to Poundland earlier this week, according to the trade journal The Grocer, after an accounting scandal hit the British chain\u2019s South African parent company Steinhoff. Poundland said it did not expect any problems with stocks in the run-up to Christmas and that it was \u201cprofitable, cash generating and trading very strongly\u201d. \u201cWe are having a great Christmas and the behaviour of this credit insurer is irrational,\u201d a spokesman for the company said. \u201cWe are working to make sure suppliers have the full facts about the strong trading of the business.\u201d Industry insiders said Poundland was likely to be well set for Christmas and that many large brands the group stocked would not be reliant on cover by Atradius or other credit insurers. With a week of the Christmas trading season to go, Poundland\u2019s stocks will all be in place. One supplier told The Grocer that he would not be able to deliver more stock to Poundland because his business had a policy not to ship to a retailer which did not have full credit insurance cover. But one industry expert told the Guardian: \u201cIt will be more of an issue in the new year.\u201d Suppliers rely on credit insurers as they often deliver goods at least a month before they receive payment. Without cover, they have to shoulder the risk if the retailer they sell to goes bust. There is no suggestion that Poundland is in financial difficulties. The credit insurance issue arose after Steinhoff revealed last week that it was under criminal and tax investigations relating to a $7bn (\u00a35.3bn) hole in its accounts. Steinhoff\u2019s shares have dived more than 80% since the news. Its chief executive, Markus Jooste, resigned last week and its chairman, Christo Wiese, who is a major shareholder, resigned on Friday. PricewaterhouseCoopers is investigating the accounting irregularities, linked to Steinhoff\u2019s assets outside South Africa. The company, which owns retailers around the world including Harveys and Benson for Beds in the UK and Conforama in France, has said it will sell \u20ac1bn of assets to shore up its balance sheet. Some commentators believe Poundland, which Steinhoff bought just over a year ago, could go on the block. The company is set to meet its bankers on 19 December in a bid to find a way out of the crisis and refinance the debt, which has fuelled its purchase of assets including Poundland. Atradius declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Household names such as Flora and I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter have been sold by consumer goods giant Unilever to private equity house KKR in a \u00a36bn deal. Unilever put the unit up for sale in April in a bid to rejuvenate its business, sparking a bidding war among buyout firms. Bloomberg calculations showed it was the biggest-leveraged buyout in Europe announced this year. The operation employs 2,300 people around the world and also owns the brands ProActiv, Becel, Blue Band, Rama and Country Crock. It represents about 7% of Unilever\u2019s global business, which will continue to own hundreds of brands, including soap powder Persil, food product Knorr, Lipton tea and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice-cream. The sell-off was announced as part of an effort to overhaul the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company in the wake of the unwanted \u00a3115bn takeover bid from Kraft Heinz. That bid, one of the largest in corporate history, was dropped in February after Unilever made it clear it did not want to sell.

It\u2019s just greed. Nobody needs that sort of money.\u201d On Persimmon\u2019s half-built Bluebell Gardens estate in the Yorkshire market town of Morley, residents were similarly unimpressed. \u201cIn my personal point of view I don\u2019t think anyone is worth that sort of money,\u201d said Dave Tate, who moved into his new-build townhouse in July. \u201cPeople at that level negotiate their own contracts \u2013 his contact will have targets and he\u2019s done the job \u2013 but it\u2019s the people who do the work for him, the ones who are told: \u2018Do this, big lad\u2019 \u2013 they won\u2019t see any of that bonus.\u201d Tate, a 47-year-old Highways England worker, said he had experienced a few problems with the \u00a3190,000 Housing Association property, which he rents, including damp affecting the brickwork. Is he happy with the house? \u201cYes and no. There\u2019s certain things we\u2019ve had issues with but all new houses have issues.\u201d Stylish new houses ranging from \u00a3170,950 to \u00a3300,000 began springing up on the estate, five miles south of Leeds, last year as Persimmon cashed in on the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme. A steady stream of young couples arrived at the estate\u2019s marketing suite on Friday afternoon, while outside a constant sound of drilling reverberated from the building site where more homes are shooting up. On Layburn Avenue, one homeowner said she had lived in her semi-detached house for just three months after purchasing it under help to buy. \u201cWe are happy here but the quality is very low,\u201d she said, declining to give her name. \u201cWe\u2019ve been complaining about the plumbing \u2013 it\u2019s very close to the electric and it\u2019s a danger \u2013 but we\u2019re still waiting for them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s hope the penny now drops for Jeff Fairburn, Persimmon\u2019s chief executive and a man looking to scoop a bonus currently worth around \u00a3110m. The moral to be drawn from the resignation of the chairman, Nicholas Wrigley, should be simple: you don\u2019t deserve the full whack, so best to forfeit a good chunk or make a hefty donation to charity. Wrigley\u2019s resignation, note, was not forced by Persimmon\u2019s shareholders. Most fund managers don\u2019t care about Fairburn\u2019s good fortune because it comes with a share price that has performed spectacularly well since the incentive scheme was put in place in 2012. Instead, Wrigley is embarrassed by the sheer size of the sums and his central role in making them possible. He \u2013 and the pay committee chair, Jonathan Davie, who is also going \u2013 should have put a cap on rewards. They failed to do so. They are resigning because they made a shocking error, or \u201comission\u201d as they call it. But their resignations may also be designed to encourage Fairburn to do the right thing. The same applies to the group managing director, Dave Jenkinson, and finance director, Mike Killoran. Together, the trio could be entitled to about \u00a3200m at the current share price, the fattest helpings from a scheme worth roughly \u00a3500m between Persimmon\u2019s top 150 managers. The first slug of shares becomes due on 31 December and outrage over these rewards, which have plainly been inflated by the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme, has been rising all year. Yet, two weeks from the trigger date for the first payments, the silence of the executives is deafening. After Wrigley\u2019s resignation, that position looks untenable. Fairburn &amp; co might protest that giving to charity ought to be a private matter but, come on, Persimmon is a member of the FTSE 100 index and has a reputation to maintain. A \u201cnone of your business\u201d stance is not going to work. The departing Wrigley clearly sees the point. The housebuilding sector is at the centre of a political storm to the point where the chancellor has ordered an inquiry into allegations of \u201clandbanking\u201d, or the hoarding of the land to benefit from rising prices. Firms, including Persimmon, protest their innocence but the whole industry has an image problem when there is an affordability crisis in housing. Mega-million payouts to lucky managers look appalling. The incentive scheme itself was a creation of the times. Housebuilders\u2019 share prices had been clobbered by the financial crash and recession. Investors wanted hard promises that firms could escape the traditional boom-to-bust cycle. Wrigley\u2019s idea \u2013 encouraged by shareholders \u2013 was to set up a 10-year scheme that would be valuable to managers only if cash was returned to shareholders without piling up debt. The plan has worked in the sense that Persimmon has returned \u00a31.5bn so far, with more to follow. The share price has quadrupled. But it\u2019s obvious to everybody that management skill has been only one factor in the success. Aside from help to buy, the revival of the mortgage market, with the encouragement of the Bank of England, has worked wonders for all housebuilders. That is the luck element \u2013 and the reason why rewards should have been capped. Persimmon, for what it is worth, is a well-run company that has accelerated its building programme faster than most big rivals. Nor has it milked London\u2019s house price boom. The York-based firm operates mostly outside the south-east and the average selling price of its houses is about \u00a3210,000. But those qualities don\u2019t justify a \u00a3110m payout for the boss. While Persimmon\u2019s shares have had a storming run, so have those of most competitors, including those who didn\u2019t adopt a souped-up bonus culture. In retrospect, the cash-return goals were also too soft. It is odds-on that Persimmon will hit its supposedly stretching 2021 targets next year. In other words, the rewards for executives have been massively inflated by lottery-like features. From a legal perspective, Persimmon can do nothing. Fairburn &amp; co must decide how greedy they wish to be. This article was amended on 18 December 2017 to correct a claim that Persimmon did not operate in south-east England. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "body": "<p>Let\u2019s hope the penny now drops for Jeff Fairburn, Persimmon\u2019s chief executive and a man looking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/15/persimmon-chair-resigns-chief-executive-obscene-bonus\">scoop a bonus currently worth around \u00a3110m</a>.</p> <p>The moral to be drawn from the resignation of the chairman, Nicholas Wrigley, should be simple: you don\u2019t deserve the full whack, so best to forfeit a good chunk or make a hefty donation to charity.</p> <p>Wrigley\u2019s resignation, note, was not forced by Persimmon\u2019s shareholders. Most fund managers don\u2019t care about Fairburn\u2019s good fortune because it comes with a share price that has performed spectacularly well since the incentive scheme was put in place in 2012.</p> <p>Instead, Wrigley is embarrassed by the sheer size of the sums and his central role in making them possible. He \u2013 and the pay committee chair, Jonathan Davie, who is also going \u2013 should have put a cap on rewards. They failed to do so. They are resigning because they made a shocking error, or \u201comission\u201d as they call it.</p> <p>But their resignations may also be designed to encourage Fairburn to do the right thing. The same applies to the group managing director, Dave Jenkinson, and finance director, Mike Killoran. Together, the trio could be entitled to about \u00a3200m at the current share price, the fattest helpings from a scheme worth roughly \u00a3500m between Persimmon\u2019s top 150 managers.</p> <p>The first slug of shares becomes due on 31 December and outrage over these rewards, which have plainly been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2017/oct/21/help-to-buy-property-new-build-price-rise\">inflated by the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme</a>, has been rising all year. Yet, two weeks from the trigger date for the first payments, the silence of the executives is deafening.</p> <p>After Wrigley\u2019s resignation, that position looks untenable. Fairburn &amp; co might protest that giving to charity ought to be a private matter but, come on, Persimmon is a member of the FTSE 100 index and has a reputation to maintain. A \u201cnone of your business\u201d stance is not going to work.</p> <p>The departing Wrigley clearly sees the point. The housebuilding sector is at the centre of a political storm to the point where the chancellor has ordered an inquiry into allegations of \u201clandbanking\u201d, or the hoarding of the land to benefit from rising prices.</p> <p>Firms, including Persimmon, protest their innocence but the whole industry has an image problem when there is an affordability crisis in housing. Mega-million payouts to lucky managers look appalling.</p> <p>The incentive scheme itself was a creation of the times. Housebuilders\u2019 share prices had been clobbered by the financial crash and recession. Investors wanted hard promises that firms could escape the traditional boom-to-bust cycle. Wrigley\u2019s idea \u2013 encouraged by shareholders \u2013 was to set up a 10-year scheme that would be valuable to managers only if cash was returned to shareholders without piling up debt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2017/oct/21/help-to-buy-property-new-build-price-rise\">Help to buy has mostly helped housebuilders boost profits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The plan has worked in the sense that Persimmon has returned \u00a31.5bn so far, with more to follow. The share price has quadrupled. But it\u2019s obvious to everybody that management skill has been only one factor in the success. Aside from help to buy, the revival of the mortgage market, with the encouragement of the Bank of England, has worked wonders for all housebuilders. That is the luck element \u2013 and the reason why rewards should have been capped.</p> <p>Persimmon, for what it is worth, is a well-run company that has accelerated its building programme faster than most big rivals. Nor has it milked London\u2019s house price boom. The York-based firm operates mostly outside the south-east and the average selling price of its houses is about \u00a3210,000.</p> <p>But those qualities don\u2019t justify a \u00a3110m payout for the boss. While Persimmon\u2019s shares have had a storming run, so have those of most competitors, including those who didn\u2019t adopt a souped-up bonus culture. In retrospect, the cash-return goals were also too soft. It is odds-on that Persimmon will hit its supposedly stretching 2021 targets next year. </p> <p>In other words, the rewards for executives have been massively inflated by lottery-like features. From a legal perspective, Persimmon can do nothing. Fairburn &amp; co must decide how greedy they wish to be.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 18 December 2017 to correct a claim that Persimmon did not operate in south-east England.</li> </ul> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chair of housebuilding firm Persimmon has resigned over his role in orchestrating a \u00a3100m-plus bonus for the company\u2019s chief executive, as critics accused the firm of benefiting from the taxpayer-backed help-to-buy scheme. The huge share award worth around \u00a3110m was attacked by politicians, charities and corporate governance experts, who described it as \u201cobscene\u201d, \u201ccorporate looting\u201d and a reward based on \u201ctaxpayer subsidies\u201d. Persimmon is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government\u2019s help-to-buy programme, which has lifted sales and boosted house prices across the UK. Nicholas Wrigley, the company\u2019s chair and a former banker, said he regretted not capping the company\u2019s bonus scheme and was leaving \u201cin recognition of this omission\u201d. The scheme, believed to be Britain\u2019s most generous ever bonus payout, will give more than \u00a3500m to 150 senior staff, including the award to the chief executive, Jeff Fairburn. The Guardian understands Wrigley had put pressure on Fairburn to donate some of his bonus to charity, although Persimmon declined to comment. The payouts, in company shares that can then be cashed in, are linked to the FTSE 100 company\u2019s dividend payments and stock market performance, which has been significantly boosted by the help-to-buy scheme. Under help to buy, the Treasury provides a loan worth 20% of the value of a property, although the buyer must also provide a 5% deposit from their own funds. The programme has provided a significant boost to property developers\u2019 sales since George Osborne introduced it in 2013. Persimmon\u2019s share price has more than doubled since help to buy launched in April 2013. About half of Persimmon homes sold last year were to help-to-buy recipients, meaning government money helped finance the sales. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, told the Guardian that the \u201cscale of this bonus is obscene\u201d and built on a \u201cgovernment subsidy\u201d. \u201cIt is reminiscent of the worst excesses of corporate greed that helped to create the financial crisis, when short-termism was heavily incentivised and long-term planning ignored,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is also a perverse situation where a corporate fortune has been built on what is essentially a government subsidy in help to buy. This situation shows just why help to buy is so flawed: it fuels demand rather than supply, putting house prices even further out of reach of young people, while adding zeros to the bank balances of housebuilding executives.\u201d Fairburn is due to collect the first \u00a350m worth of bonus shares on 31 December. The scheme, which is based on the level of dividend returned to shareholders, was meant to take 10 years to pay out, but the company has accelerated dividend payments. This means Fairburn, other executives and more than 100 middle managers are likely to collect all of the bonus shares by July 2018, far ahead of the 2021 schedule. Fairburn\u2019s tranche of shares was worth \u00a3128m based on Friday night\u2019s closing share price, but he is likely to take home about \u00a3110m once he has paid the option prices on the shares. John Hunter, the chair of the UK Shareholder Association, which represents small investors, said the bonus scheme was \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d and was based solely on the dividend payments. \u201cAny bloody fool can pay dividends \u2013 it\u2019s just paying them their own money. The scheme is doing the opposite of what it is meant to do \u2013 incentivise performance and retention,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cHow does this incentivise people when they\u2019re all sitting on fortunes? If you\u2019re a manager and you\u2019re getting millions you would retire on the spot.\u201d Hunter said Persimmon had defended the scheme, which was approved by 85% of investors in 2012, as a reflection of the company\u2019s strong performance and the billions of pounds it had returned to investors through dividends. \u201cIt has done brilliantly well \u2013 with our money,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp to buy has been almost a licence to print money \u2013 our money. These bonuses are being subsided by us.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t blame directors for putting their hands in an open cookie jar \u2013 they are only human. The question here is how this scheme ever got approved.\u201d Jonathan Davie, Persimmon\u2019s senior independent director and chair of the remuneration committee, which sets company pay, also resigned on Thursday. \u201cNicholas and Jonathan recognise that the 2012 LTIP [long-term incentive plan] could have included a cap,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIn recognition of this omission, they have therefore tendered their resignations.\u201d Davie resigned with immediate effect. Wrigley will stay on until his successor has been appointed. \u201cSince 2012, when the capital return plan strategy was launched and the 2012 LTIP was approved by shareholders, the company has made substantial cash returns to shareholders at the same time as increasing the size of the business and delivering significant shareholder value,\u201d Persimmon said in a statement to the stock market. \u201cPersimmon has delivered an increase in the number of new homes supplied of over 65%, invested \u00a32.9bn in new land, returned 485p per share (\u00a31.5bn) in cash and increased the proposed capital return by 49% to 925p per share, about \u00a32.85bn.\u201d Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), one of the company\u2019s shareholders, said Fairburn should volunteer to forego some of the bonus or make a sizeable donation to charity. \u201cWhilst we hold the remaining senior management team in high regard, we would ask that the CEO and the remaining members of the pay committee acknowledge their errors and correct them,\u201d Ashley Hamilton Claxton, RLAM\u2019s head of responsible investment, said. \u201cOne of the options the CEO could consider would be taking a voluntary reduction, or donating some of the money.\u201d Garry White, the chief investment commentator at the stockbroker Charles Stanley, said: \u201cThe size of these bonuses means management could easily be accused of corporate looting, so shareholders have every right to be unimpressed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Almost a decade of improvements in household finances has started to be unpicked in the year since the EU referendum, according to the Bank of England. Findings from a biannual study for Threadneedle Street of more than 6,000 UK households found an increase in people reporting high mortgage debt when considering their income, while there were also worrying increases in repayments and in costs for renters. The survey, carried out by the research firm NMG Consulting on behalf of the Bank in September, found the highest percentage of households reporting mortgage debts of more than four times their earnings than at any time since 2013. It also said the proportion with debt repayments representing more than 40% of income had risen over the past year \u2013 although remaining below historic levels. The increase was described by the report as a \u201cslight deterioration\u201d in the health of households\u2019 finances, although it added that the trend for stronger balance sheets since the credit crunch in 2008 was coming to an end. This could fuel growing concerns over the strength of household finances over the coming years. The survey also found that for the first time in the past three years, the balance of households expecting an improvement in their financial position had turned negative. \u201cThe responses to a question on expectations about the general economic situation have declined sharply since the EU referendum result,\u201d the report added. The findings are important for the Bank because they will help to shed light on the health of household finances just before its monetary policy committee increased the cost of borrowing for the first time in a decade. The survey said last month\u2019s interest rate hike \u2013 from 0.25% to 0.5% \u2013 would have a \u201climited impact\u201d on households with high debt repayments compared to their income. Only around 2.5% of homes with a mortgage would need to take action by spending less or working more, it said. The figures also come amid a boom in the usage of personal loans, credit cards and car finance, with a growth rate outstripping the rise in earnings by almost five times. Bank of England data shows personal debts have risen to levels unseen since the financial crisis, reaching more than \u00a3200bn. The report found that average borrowing on consumer credit was about \u00a38,000 \u2013 broadly flat versus aggregate trends. However, it cautioned that the latest survey data did not appear to pick up the continuing trend in the official data \u2013 which shows an annual growth rate of almost 10%. There was some positive feedback from the report, showing consumer expectations for rising wages are beginning to return to their pre-referendum levels. The Bank has been watching for rising pay levels to justify its rate hike, believing that higher wages tend to spark a spiral of increasing prices. The Office for National Statistics also reported a slight pick-up in earnings growth earlier this week, but the 2.3% annual increase in the three months to October was lower than the 2.6% recorded in the same period of 2016 \u2013 while pay still trails well behind inflation for an eighth month. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "body": "<p>Almost a decade of improvements in household finances has started to be unpicked in the year since the EU referendum, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a>. </p> <p>Findings from a biannual study for Threadneedle Street of more than 6,000 UK households found an increase in people reporting high mortgage debt when considering their income, while there were also worrying increases in repayments and in costs for renters. </p> <p>The survey, carried out by the research firm NMG Consulting on behalf of the Bank in September, found the highest percentage of households reporting mortgage debts of more than four times their earnings than at any time since 2013. It also said the proportion with debt repayments representing more than 40% of income had risen over the past year \u2013 although remaining below historic levels.</p> <p>The increase was described by the report as a \u201cslight deterioration\u201d in the health of households\u2019 finances, although it added that the trend for stronger balance sheets since the credit crunch in 2008 was coming to an end. This could fuel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/26/philip-hammond-could-be-putting-the-uk-on-course-for-another-recession\">growing concerns over the strength of household finances</a> over the coming years.<br></p> <p>The survey also found that for the first time in the past three years, the balance of households expecting an improvement in their financial position had turned negative. \u201cThe responses to a question on expectations about the general economic situation have declined sharply since the EU referendum result,\u201d the report added. </p> <p>The findings are important for the Bank because they will help to shed light on the health of household finances just before its monetary policy committee increased the cost of borrowing for the first time in a decade. </p> <p>The survey said last month\u2019s interest rate hike \u2013 from 0.25% to 0.5% \u2013 would have a \u201climited impact\u201d on households with high debt repayments compared to their income.

      "bodyText": "Barely had the results of the EU referendum sunk in when a doctored photo of the famous banner that hangs from Madrid\u2019s Cibeles palace began doing the rounds on social media. The \u201crefugees welcome\u201d sign that adorns the offices of the city council had been mischievously prefixed with a single word: British. Eighteen months on, despite enduring bafflement over the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU, the Spanish capital is getting down to business. Refugees are welcome, and so are the companies and revenues that London is set to lose over the coming years. There is no overt glee in Madrid, no licking of lips or cooking up of slogans based on dubious stereotypes, but there is a growing acknowledgement that some of the City of London\u2019s losses could be this city\u2019s gains. \u201cWe think Brexit isn\u2019t good for either party,\u201d said Enrique L\u00f3pez Gal\u00e1n, an economic and business development adviser for Madrid\u2019s city council. \u201cThe idea that a load of businesses are going to leave England will depend on whether a hard or soft Brexit is negotiated.\u201d In the meantime, the council is making plans. It will open an office in February in central Madrid where an English-speaking team of experts will work to attract foreign investment, and it is also in the process of hiring a promoter to drum up business in London. \u201cLooking at the way the negotiations are going, it looks like the businesses that are going to be most affected are service industries, the ones that need authorisation or a deal to operate in the European economic area, so financial services; aeronautic businesses,\u201d said L\u00f3pez Gal\u00e1n. Adam Austerfield, the director of the global markets team at LSE Enterprise and national vice-president of the British Chambers of Commerce in Spain, believes some Spanish financial services firms concerned over passporting rights may relocate some of their operations from the UK to Madrid. He says it is doubtful, however, that the Spanish capital will pose a threat to Paris and Frankfurt when it comes to luring financial services from London and that its main competitors will be Amsterdam, Dublin, Rome, Milan and Berlin. \u201cEven Dublin and Amsterdam will only pick up some parts and mainly for fiscal reasons rather than domestic markets,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile Madrid will probably reabsorb some financial services from existing investors in the UK, it\u2019s unlikely to be a scaled-up operation or even continental HQ of the big investment banks such as JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley, for example.\u201d Spain\u2019s growth rate \u2013 and the part played in it by Madrid, which generates almost 20% of the country\u2019s GDP \u2013 has made it an attractive destination for investors, as have its competitive tax rates. The city has one unassailable advantage over all it competitors. \u201cYou also need to look at Spain as a platform to Latin America,\u201d said Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez, KPMG\u2019s partner responsible for Brexit. \u201cMadrid is the region that has the best access to Latin America.\u201d The city council also likes to trumpet Operation Chamart\u00edn \u2013 a long-trailed, multibillion-euro scheme to redevelop part of northern Madrid and create a new financial district. \u201cOperation Chamart\u00edn, the most important urban project in Europe, is an enormous and really important attraction,\u201d said Luis Cueto, the chief of staff to Madrid\u2019s mayor, Manuela Carmena, and the official responsible for promoting the city abroad. \u201cBusinesses can relocate to existing offices or even construct their own buildings. Lots of companies want an emblematic display of their presence.\u201d Others are more sceptical about Madrid\u2019s post-Brexit offer. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement about this, but I have my doubts that the level of excitement is going to be matched by reality,\u201d said Federico Steinberg, a senior analyst at Spain\u2019s Elcano Royal Institute. \u201cBasically, there\u2019s this narrative that goes: \u2018Madrid is a great place to live\u2019, and that\u2019s actually true. Whenever expats are asked where they\u2019d like to live, Madrid tends to come up because of the quality of life, the weather and the food.\u201d Quality of life may not be enough, however, especially as office space remains a problem and the Operation Chamart\u00edn development will take a while to build, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one constraint. Then people argue that the tax treatment and labour market regulations could be improved if you really want to bring more people onboard,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cIn practical terms, I think that means there are other cities that are probably as qualified or even better qualified. English is an issue, so Ireland is obviously better prepared in that sense, and then you\u2019ve got Frankfurt for the financial system, or Amsterdam. You\u2019re closer to the action than in Madrid.\u201d Cueto agrees that Madrid\u2019s pitch needs to extend well beyond what he calls the city\u2019s \u201clegendary quality of life\u201d. While it may be true, he thinks it is not overly relevant. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to earn money and my business is going to prosper, does it matter if it\u2019s cold? You\u2019re not going to move just to suit your employees better.\u201d There was, he said, a far more basic, weighty matter at the heart of the Brexit gold rush. \u201cThe most important thing when companies make decisions about moving is the tax issue, and that\u2019s not something the city has much say on, as local taxes are very small and are irrelevant for big companies. That\u2019s up to the state.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "BP returns to solar power with $200m stake in Lightsource", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP has paid $200m (\u00a3149m) for a 43% stake in Europe\u2019s biggest solar developer, marking its return to the sector from which it withdrew six years ago. The investment in the London-based Lightsource marks a turnaround for the British oil firm, which rebranded as Beyond Petroleum in 2000 but shut its alternative energy headquarters nine years later. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be coming back to solar, but in a new and very different way,\u201d said BP\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley. Dev Sanyal, the firm\u2019s chief executive for alternative energy, said BP was returning to solar because the sector had matured and the model had shifted from manufacturing panels to developing solar farms. \u201c[Solar] is really an important part of the overall energy mix. It will constitute around 10% of global power in the next 20 years and is growing around 15% per annum. We like the fundamentals of the industry and we like the fundamentals of the company,\u201d he said. The solar firm will be renamed Lightsource BP and BP will take two seats on the company\u2019s board. Nick Boyle, founder and chief executive of Lightsource, said in many countries solar had moved from relying on government support to being able to compete on its own. \u201cIn the last couple of years, we\u2019ve hit that interesting inflection point where unsubsidised solar has become a direct competitor and something that actually beat other forms of electricity generation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas before the market was very different and needed support, now we are in a completely new world.\u201d The company will focus on building solar projects in the US, India, Europe and the Middle East. While the $200m stake is a small fraction of BP\u2019s $15bn-17bn total spend this year, Sanyal said it was a substantial investment.

      "bodyText": "EC president Jean-Claude Juncker is not the only one to warn that difficult times lie ahead for the Brexit talks. Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a new report: The agreement in principle on the terms of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union is positive to the extent further delays would have reduced the time available to avert a \u201cno- deal\u201d scenario on 29 March 2019... However, the forthcoming trade talks will likely be difficult and there is a significant possibility of further deadlocks before a final agreement is reached. \u201cThe broad agreement between the EU and UK allows talks to start in early-2018 on arrangements during the transition period,\u201d said Colin Ellis, a Moody\u2019s Managing Director and co-author of the report. \u201cHowever, the agreement between the EU and the UK on \u2018phase one\u2019 withdrawal issues does not actually resolve many details, for instance around the Irish border, and nor does it imply that future discussions will go smoothly. It\u2019s primarily a political device to allow talks to progress.\u201d The risk of further deadlocks in talks is substantial and the uncertainty concerning the terms of UK\u2019s future long-term relationship with the EU will prevail beyond a transition deal until a conclusive final agreement is reached. This will continue to hamper corporate investment and curtail the operating environment for UK issuers, particularly for those which are highly regulated by EU frameworks. The initiation of talks on transitional arrangements in early-2018 is consistent with Moody\u2019s base case of a manageable impact of Brexit for rated UK companies, given that further delays would have reduced the time available to avert a \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario. As outlined previously, if there is no deal, Moody\u2019s would likely see disruptions to trade and a further fall in sterling, which would severely affect sectors that are heavily dependent on imports and goods flows from and with the EU, including food retailers and ports, highly regulated by current EU frameworks, in particular the UK airport and aviation sector. The uncertainties over the outlook have helped push sterling even lower. The pound is currently down 0.63% against the dollar at $1.3348. The FTSE 100 is benefitting from the fall in sterling, up 0.23% at 7465. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Some weaker than expected US data. The New York Federal Reserves Empire current business conditions index fell from 19.4 in November to 18 in December, lower than the expected 18.6. The six month index came in at 46.6, down from 49.9 last month. Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here. The fall in the pound has, conversely and not surprisingly, helped push the FTSE 100 higher. The index has reversed its early losses, up 0.13%, thanks to the number of overseas earners which benefit from a weaker sterling. The pound continues to slide after its early gains. It is now down 0.26% against the dollar at $1.3394, its low of the day. Against the euro it has now dropped 0.39% to \u20ac1.1350. The currency has been hit by EC president Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s comments about the difficulty of the next stage of negotiations. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: The pound went from wary to worried this Friday, as investors fretted over the Brexit difficulties that lie ahead. Time to think it the last thing sterling needs at the moment. Whenever UK investors have a spare second, thoughts tend to turn to the loud tick of the Brexit bomb. And even with the progress seen in the last couple of weeks \u2013 and the ...EU formally agreeing to move on to the next phase of negotiations this Friday \u2013 there\u2019s still not a lot for the pound to actually be thankful for. In the retail world, another worrying sign for high street stores, this time from H&amp;M. Its shares have tumbled after a disappointing trading update. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: High Street retailer H&amp;M has seen almost a sixth of its market valuation wiped off after the Swedish clothing retailer lost more ground to rival Zara. H&amp;M reported the biggest drop in quarterly sales in more than ten years this morning with fewer customers visiting stores and the news has caused the firm to reign in expansion plans and now possibly even consider closures. The plight is a familiar tale amongst bricks-and-mortar retailers who have struggled of late on both sides of the Atlantic due to the growth seen in e-commerce. Rival Inditex, the owner of the Zara brand, has expanded aggressively into the space and reported a double-digit rebound in revenue growth for November and early December. Italian banks are coming under pressure on continuing worries about bad loans, as well as the uncertainty created by next year\u2019s general election. The Italian bank index is currently down 1.6% to its lowest level since the end of June. Here\u2019s our full story on the Persimmon executive departures: The chair of Persimmon has resigned over his role in orchestrating a \u00a3128m bonus for the housebuilder\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Fairburn, that will begin paying out on New Year\u2019s Eve. Nicholas Wrigley, the company\u2019s chair and a former banker, said he regretted not capping the bonus scheme and was leaving \u201cin recognition of this omission\u201d. The Guardian understands that Wrigley had put pressure on Fairburn to donate of some of his bonus to charity, although Persimmon declined to comment. The bonus scheme \u2013 believed to be the most generous ever in the UK \u2013 is due to start paying out more than \u00a3800m to 150 senior staff on 31 December. The payouts are linked to the company\u2019s stock market performance, which has been massively boosted by the government\u2019s help to buy scheme. Persimmon\u2019s share price has more than doubled since George Osborne introduced help to buy in 2013. About half of Persimmon homes sold last year were to help to buy recipients, meaning that government money helped finance the sale. The pay deal, which was put in place in 2012, has been widely criticised by politicians, charities and corporate governance experts the Guardian had contacted this week. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the \u201cscale of this bonus is obscene\u201d and built on a \u201cgovernment subsidy\u201d. The full story is here: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Brexit is back on the cards as a core driver of markets sentiment today, with EU leaders expected to push negotiations into their second stage today. Interestingly, while the EU leaders have lauded Theresa May\u2019s recent efforts, the fact that parliament could now vote down a final bill highlights that any back door concessions from May could come back to bite her. Despite the desire to kick-off trade negotiations in December, it is clear that those in the EU see March as the likeliest month to commence talks. With timelines already tight, the slower progression will heap further pressure on negotiations as they seek to obtain a transitional deal ahead of the March 2019 deadline. And here\u2019s our live blog of the EU summit: Here is European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker earlier (see below): Back with Brexit, and Kallum Pickering, senior UK Economist at Berenberg, has been looking at the possible outcomes to the talks: \u25cf Round one over, two more ahead: Nine months after the UK started the Brexit proceedings, the terms of divorce are broadly settled. The UK and the EU will now move on to negotiations for a transition period and future UK-EU trade. These must be completed by October 2018 to give the EU27 six months to ratify any deal. In this report, we consider the key issues for the upcoming negotiations and the likely scenarios for future UK-EU trade. \u25cf A future trade deal rests on the Irish border question: The UK\u2019s aim to leave the customs union seems to contradict the need to preserve the status quo in Ireland. But as part of the mutually agreed divorce, the UK has pledged to prioritise the status quo in Ireland over leaving the single market and the customs union. While this provides the grounds for a potentially (very) soft Brexit, it also crosses key red lines of the Brexiteers. This contradiction will come to a head in the UK debate before the UK and the EU can settle on a framework deal for future trade. The potential outcomes can be grouped into four Brexit scenarios \u25cf Soft Brexit (30% chance): As two-thirds of the members of the UK parliament are pro-EU, such a deal would probably get a majority backing in parliament. If faced with a choice between no more than a basic free trade arrangement covering only goods and a comprehensive \u201cNorway-minus\u201d deal, the UK could go for the later. \u25cf Semi-soft Brexit (45%): This is the most likely scenario. The UK stays close enough to EU rules for many goods and some services to avoid a hard border in Ireland. UK remainers could support a deal that keeps the UK partly aligned with the EU while the Brexiteers could back such an agreement as it would offer the UK some room to pursue its non-EU ambitions. The UK and the EU could probably find a solution the Irish question \u2013 possibly a bespoke customs arrangement. \u25cf No deal \u2013 hard Brexit (20%): With so many interests \u2013 and careers \u2013 at stake, the risk that talks could fail at any point remains a serious one. \u25cf No Brexit (only 5% probability): The only possible route to a reversal of Brexit would be through fresh elections that ended up with either Labour, or some Labour-led coalition with the pro-EU Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, going for a second referendum that reversed the result of the first. More on the US tax reforms. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, said: European equity markets are slightly softer as investors mull the possibility that the US tax reform bill may get derailed at the last minute. The anticipation of US tax reform has fuelled the US equity rally and given financials a major boost, so the stakes are high. The Republicans can afford a draw in the Senate, as Vice-President Mike Pence casts the deciding vote, but this deal is a key risk for markets, and its defeat, while unlikely, could cause carnage. The pound has lost its early gains, slipping back against both the dollar and euro. Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite said EU leaders would agree to move forward onto trade in the Brexit negotiations, which are expected to start in March. But European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker the second phase of talks would be harder than the first, which were already \u201cvery difficult.\u201d So some of the shine has come off sterling. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Dependent on whether its announced in time, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how much the pound moves on the expected formal confirmation from EU leaders that they\u2019re ready to move on to the next stage of negotiations with the UK. And while the fact that it is almost a given at this point might dampen the sterling\u2019s enthusiasm, considering it\u2019s rocky December form the currency shouldn\u2019t turn its nose up at any good news, however predictable. Regardless it does seem like the pound is waiting for something. Against the dollar it has trickled into the red, but is still holding around $1.343, while against the euro it is effectively unchanged just below the \u20ac1.14 mark. Housebuilder Persimmon is in the middle of a pay row, and now some of its top executives are stepping down. PA reports: The chairman of Persimmon is to quit the housebuilder following concerns over excessive executive pay at the firm. Persimmon announced on Friday that Nicholas Wrigley intends to resign and also revealed that remuneration committee chair Jonathan Davie has left the group. It follows investor consternation over a long term incentive plan introduced in 2012, which could see the management share 600 million depending on profit and housebuilding targets. Chief executive Jeff Fairburn is in line for the biggest payout, which is set to top 100 million. Announcing Mr Wrigley and Mr Davie\u2019s departures, Persimmon admitted that the generous pay out plan presided over by the duo \u201ccould have included a cap\u201d. Persimmon said: \u201cThe company introduced a Long Term Incentive Plan in 2012 (2012 LTIP). \u201cThe board believes that the introduction of the 2012 LTIP has been a significant factor in the Company\u2019s outstanding performance over this period, led by a strong and talented Executive team. \u201cNevertheless, Nicholas and Jonathan recognise that the 2012 LTIP could have included a cap. In recognition of this omission, they have therefore tendered their resignations.\u201d But Persimmon went on to say that since the award scheme was launched, the company has made \u201csubstantial cash returns to shareholders at the same time as increasing the size of the business and delivering significant value\u201d. It added that Persimmon has delivered an increase in the number of new homes supplied and invested 2.9 billion in new land. Ryanair appears to be offering the olive branch to pilots in an effort to avert a pre-Christmas strike. The low cost airline has written to pilot unions in Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal inviting them to talks to recognise the union. In return it has called on the unions to call off a strike planned for next Wednesday, December 20. This would be the first time it would recognise pilot unions in its 32-year history. As expected, markets have made a downbeat start in Europe. The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.16% to 7436 in early trading. Meanwhile Germany\u2019s Dax has opened down 0.26%, France\u2019s Cac is off 0.39%, Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.22% lower and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has fallen 0.5%. Wall Street fell back on Thursday on continuing doubts about the Republican tax plan, and whether it will ever get passed. Florida senator Marco Rubio said he would not vote for the package unless there were changes to child tax credits. With only a slim majority in the Senate, the long awaited reforms seem to have hit another hurdle. Some kind of compromise plan is expected to be released today, in expectation of final votes early next week. London Capital\u2019s Jasper Lawler again: Republicans can\u2019t afford to lose more than two votes, or the bill won\u2019t get the necessary approval. Adding to tension, several Republican Senators are experiencing health problems, which could also prevent them voting. Following Rubio\u2019s comment US indices took a turn for the worse. Investors have been watching the twists and turns of this bill with great focus, because of its expected impact on big firms. At the moment the futures are suggesting the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which dropped 76 points yesterday - should recover around 43 points at the open today. Many of today\u2019s front pages are dominated by one story in particular, and that\u2019s the Disney/Fox deal: Here is our story on the deal: And Nils Pratley\u2019s view: The strengthening of sterling is likely to see the FTSE 100 - which is chock full of overseas earners who benefit from a weaker pound - slip back in early trading. Here are the opening forecasts from IG: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. After yesterday\u2019s central bank excitement (or snoozefest at Michael Hewson at CMC Markets described it), the focus is back on Brexit. The pound is edging higher on hopes that EU leaders will agree that sufficient progress has been made in the first set of negotiations to move the talks on, despite Theresa May\u2019s defeat in parliament on Wednesday night. Sterling is currently up 0.08% against the dollar at $1.3441 having earlier touched \u20ac1.3447, and 0.09% higher against the euro at \u20ac1.1404. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: After central bank mania over the last few days, Brexit developments will once again be the main focus as Theresa May continues meetings in Brussels. In the previous session, she won the backing of EU leaders who warned MP\u2019s in Westminster, over striking down a Brexit deal at the last minute. The warning came after Theresa May suffered her first defeat in the Commons, weakening her political position considerably and giving Parliament the right to vote on any final Brexit bill. The pound has traded higher versus the dollar for the past two consecutive sessions and has also kicked off Friday on the front foot. With few other distraction Brexit headlines and possibly a little Friday fatigue could drive trading. Here is our latest story on the EU meeting: Otherwise there is little on the economic agenda as we wind down towards the weekend. On the corporate front, Trinity Mirror has issued a trading update showing a 9% fall in like for like quarterly revenue but analyst Gareth Davies at Numis said there were no major surprises in the statement: Trinity Mirror has released a trading update that ultimately confirms confidence in achieving results for the year that are in line with expectations... Momentum on digital display and transactional revenues remains very encouraging. Discussions with Northern &amp; Shell [about the acquisition of its publishing assets including Express Newspapera] are on-going, with management noting good progress. Elsewhere BT has announced a deal with Sky to supply their most popular channels, including sport, to each others channels.",

The UK and the EU will now move on to negotiations for a transition period and future UK-EU trade. These must be completed by October 2018 to give the EU27 six months to ratify any deal. In this report, we consider the key issues for the upcoming negotiations and the likely scenarios for future UK-EU trade.</p> <p> \u25cf <strong>A future trade deal rests on the Irish border question: </strong>The UK\u2019s aim to leave the customs union seems to contradict the need to preserve the status quo in Ireland. But as part of the mutually agreed divorce, the UK has pledged to prioritise the status quo in Ireland over leaving the single market and the customs union. While this provides the grounds for a potentially (very) soft Brexit, it also crosses key red lines of the Brexiteers. This contradiction will come to a head in the UK debate before the UK and the EU can settle on a framework deal for future trade.</p> <p><strong>The potential outcomes can be grouped into four Brexit scenarios </strong></p> <p> \u25cf <strong>Soft Brexit (30% chance): </strong>As two-thirds of the members of the UK parliament are pro-EU, such a deal would probably get a majority backing in parliament. If faced with a choice between no more than a basic free trade arrangement covering only goods and a comprehensive \u201cNorway-minus\u201d deal, the UK could go for the later. </p> <p> \u25cf <strong>Semi-soft Brexit (45%): </strong>This is the most likely scenario. The UK stays close enough to EU rules for many goods and some services to avoid a hard border in Ireland. UK remainers could support a deal that keeps the UK partly aligned with the EU while the Brexiteers could back such an agreement as it would offer the UK some room to pursue its non-EU ambitions. The UK and the EU could probably find a solution the Irish question \u2013 possibly a bespoke customs arrangement. </p> <p> \u25cf <strong>No deal \u2013 hard Brexit (20%): </strong>With so many interests \u2013 and careers \u2013 at stake, the risk that talks could fail at any point remains a serious one. </p> <p> \u25cf <strong>No Brexit (only 5% probability): </strong>The only possible route to a reversal of Brexit would be through fresh elections that ended up with either Labour, or some Labour-led coalition with the pro-EU Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, going for a second referendum that reversed the result of the first.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a33904924e47405c4d74c8a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-15T09:05:38.043Z\">9.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the US tax reforms. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European equity markets are slightly softer as investors mull the possibility that the US tax reform bill may get derailed at the last minute. The anticipation of US tax reform has fuelled the US equity rally and given financials a major boost, so the stakes are high. The Republicans can afford a draw in the Senate, as Vice-President Mike Pence casts the deciding vote, but this deal is a key risk for markets, and its defeat, while unlikely, could cause carnage. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a3387bb32ead406c9717666\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-12-15T08:35:42.757Z\">8.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has lost its early gains, slipping back against both the dollar and euro. </p> <p>Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite said EU leaders would agree to move forward onto trade in the Brexit negotiations, which are expected to start in March.</p> <p>But European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker the second phase of talks would be harder than the first, which were already \u201cvery difficult.\u201d So some of the shine has come off sterling. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dependent on whether its announced in time, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how much the pound moves on the expected formal confirmation from EU leaders that they\u2019re ready to move on to the next stage of negotiations with the UK.

Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After central bank mania over the last few days, Brexit developments will once again be the main focus as Theresa May continues meetings in Brussels. In the previous session, she won the backing of EU leaders who warned MP\u2019s in Westminster, over striking down a Brexit deal at the last minute. The warning came after Theresa May suffered her first defeat in the Commons, weakening her political position considerably and giving Parliament the right to vote on any final Brexit bill.</p> <p>The pound has traded higher versus the dollar for the past two consecutive sessions and has also kicked off Friday on the front foot. With few other distraction Brexit headlines and possibly a little Friday fatigue could drive trading.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is our latest story on the EU meeting:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/14/austrian-leader-christian-kern-hopes-brexit-reversed-after-commons-setback\">Theresa May tells EU: I\u2019m still in control despite Commons loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Otherwise there is little on the economic agenda as we wind down towards the weekend.

The deal marks the end of nearly a decade-long dispute over carrying each other\u2019s channels, as the two companies wrangled over commercial terms. It means Sky customers will be able to watch BT channels with sport, including Champions League, Premiership rugby and Premier League matches it does not currently air without a separate subscription. The deal will give BT TV a much needed boost \u2013 new quarterly subscriber numbers have dropped to record low of about 8,000 \u2013 with prime Sky content including all Premier League football matches to be made available. BT subscribers will also get access to Sky Atlantic, which airs programmes such as Game of Thrones, Billions, Riviera and Fortitude. They will also get Sky\u2019s entertainment channels including Sky Living, Sky One and Sky Cinema by adding the Now TV streaming service to BT set top boxes from 2019. BT will sell Now TV subscription passes, which allows customers to watch Sky programmes without a monthly subscription. BT and Sky have been at loggerheads for years over the issue of channel carriage, most acrimoniously over access to Sky\u2019s prime sports channels which had been the subject of a protracted legal battle which BT lost. BT stands to gain the most from the deal, with just 1.7 million TV customers and anaemic growth it needed to supercharge its content. Sky will gain access to pay-TV fans. Analysts believe it could affect the scale of bidding when the Premier League TV rights auction begins in February. The channel deals mean that Sky and BT customers can gain access to all Premier League matches without being forced to choose to buy TV packages from either or both.
