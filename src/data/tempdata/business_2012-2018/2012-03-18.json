    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It's probably just as well for George Osborne that budget speeches rarely linger long in the memory, because this time last year the chancellor was boasting about how his package of measures would put \"fuel in the tank of the economy\". Fuel laced with sugar, it transpires. Unlike in the US, where there are clear signs of economic recovery, Britain has gone sideways since the spring of 2011 and there is no great confidence in the Treasury or the Bank of England that it will do much better in 2012. For Labour, the lesson from what has been happening on the other side of the Atlantic could not be plainer. Over there, Barack Obama has resisted pressure from Tea Party Republicans to slash the budget deficit and has been rewarded for his bravery. Over here, the government \u2013 in the words of the oft-repeated opposition mantra \u2013 has cut too far too fast and strangled the recovery at birth. To simplify, Osborne's critics say that Keynesian economics is alive and well on the other side of the pond but has run smack up against Treasury orthodoxy in the UK, with the same baleful consequences as in the 1920s and early 1930s. Labour has great fun twitting Liberal Democrats about how their connivance in attempts to balance the budget is a repudiation of everything their great hero stood for. The core Keynesian case, as explained in the general theory, goes something like this. Aggregate spending in the economy is made up of two big elements \u2013 consumption, which is driven by income, and investment, which depends on the \"animal spirits\" of entrepreneurs. As some of Keynes's critics have noted, there was no place in it for overseas trade. Keynes said that the key relationship was between investment and national income; the economy would expand and unemployment would fall if businesses were persuaded that it was a time to spend more on plant, machinery and innovation. In normal circumstances, policy makers could achieve this end by tinkering with the cost of borrowing, because when interest rates were low there was less incentive for businesses to hold on to their cash. There were, however, times when firms would be determined to hoard their money no matter how low interest rates were driven. The solution then was what Keynes called \"a somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment\": the state stepping in to do the spending not forthcoming from the private sector because the animal spirits of entrepreneurs were low. Applying this model to the Britain of today is relatively simple. Weak real income growth and the desire to rebuild savings means that consumption growth cannot drive economic recovery, while the reluctance of banks to lend coupled with low animal spirits means private investment is not responding to ultra-loose monetary policy. Aggregate spending, therefore, can only be maintained through fiscal policy. Moreover, if the government seeks to cut budget deficits at this time it risks a Japan-style \"lost decade\". It does, indeed, seem likely that Keynes would be critical of Osborne's austerity plan (and even more disturbed at the self-flagellatory fiscal policy in the eurozone). He would have been particularly unimpressed by the bogus argument that if the private sector is paying off its debts then the public sector should be belt-tightening as well. Keynes, the founder of modern macro-economics, would have argued that this was the sort of balanced-budget strategy tried when tax receipts plummeted in the wake of the Wall Street Crash; the consequence was an even lower level of aggregate demand and a deeper slump. Keynes's advice to Osborne would be: look after employment and the deficit will look after itself. The chancellor's retort would be that he is trying to boost employment, but relying on monetary policy rather than fiscal policy to do the job. Osborne calls himself a budgetary conservative and a monetary activist, by which he means that tackling the budget deficit provides the space for the Bank of England to keep interest rates low, both directly through bank rate and indirectly through quantitative easing. Spending a bit more or announcing unfunded tax breaks would, the chancellor argues, risk alarming the financial markets, which set the interest rates on government bonds through their daily activities. Higher interest rates on bonds feed through into dearer mortgages and overdrafts. Osborne's Keynesian critics need to take this argument seriously, not least because Keynes himself was a strong advocate of monetary policy and saw the socialising of investment only as a last resort. This is a point well made by the monetarist economist Tim Congdon, who argues in his book of essays (Money in a Free Society: Encounter Books) that Keynes himself was not entirely convinced there was ever a point when monetary policy became ineffective \u2013 the so-called liquidity trap. Keynes, according to Congdon, was actually a monetarist before it became fashionable. This might be pushing it a bit, but it is worth noting that Keynes was something of an inflation hawk, thought budgets should be in surplus in the good times to balance the deficits in the bad times, and policy makers should pull all the available monetary levers first. There are, therefore, economists who believe that the real lesson from the US is that central banks need to adopt aggressive and \u2013 if needs be \u2013 unorthodox monetary policy to fight deep-seated recessionary forces. Graham Turner, of the consultancy GFC Economics has nothing but praise for the Federal Reserve's Operation Twist, intervention in the market for Treasury bills designed to cut borrowing costs by reducing interest rates on long-date bonds. Writing in the March 2012 Economic Journal, Roger Farmer of UCLA says the correct Keynesian response today is for government share buying programmes rather than fiscal expansion. All of which takes us back to Wednesday and the contents of Osborne's red box. The risk is of the UK getting stuck in low growth, high unemployment equilibrium, with an over-restrictive fiscal policy making it harder for monetary policy (interest rates, QE and the exchange rate) to gain real traction in an economy still suffering the after-effects of a severe financial shock. As such, Osborne's priorities should be to keep monetary policy loose, to engender confidence, to provide a modest fiscal boost and to ensure that any budget giveaways go to those with the highest propensity to spend rather than save. That, in case you are wondering, means the poor, not the rich.",

They were prosecutors from a tiny, debt-laden island in the Atlantic: Iceland.</p> <p>The focus of their attention is credit default swap (CDS) contracts entered into in London in relation to Kaupthing, then a struggling Icelandic bank run by executive chairman Sigurdur Einarsson from offices in Hanover Street, Mayfair.</p> <p>Said to be advising Kaupthing on its CDSs at the time were London-based credit market experts at Deutsche Bank. Millen and her ex-husband Kevin Stanford, unwittingly embroiled in the affair, were major UK-based customers of the bank. Further, in 2008 the wider Kaupthing banking group's liquidity was greatly helped by billions of pounds of deposits by UK retail savers with online bank account Kaupthing Edge. These savings accounts were ultimately guaranteed by UK taxpayers.</p> <p>Why then, you might ask, are the UK authorities not investigating? The answer is that both the FSA and SFO have indeed examined the case \u2013 very closely, in fact \u2013 but, after a lot of hand-wringing, have ruled out a criminal prosecution. The reason given is that it would be costly and \"untriable\" in front of a jury in a British court because of the complex financial instruments involved. The FSA, meanwhile, is limited by the fact that the multitrillion-pound market in CDS trades falls outside its power to prosecute for market abuse.</p> <p>So all UK criminal investigations into a suspected \u20ac500m scandal at the heart of the City, involving some of the most controversial financial instruments invented in recent years, have been ditched because the British framework for dealing with financial fraud cannot cope.</p> <p>We know some of the details of the suspected fraud from a 2,300-page report into the banking crisis commissioned by the Icelandic parliament. Published in 2010, it said: \"In the fall of 2008, Kaupthing \u2026 loaned its key clients roughly \u20ac500m for the purpose of [entering into] credit default swaps on Kaupthing itself. The clients themselves took no risks but they would have made substantial profits if the bank would have withstood \u2026 difficulties.\"</p> <p>The report went on to note that on the other end of at least some of the contracts were Deutsche Bank or its clients. Einarsson has suggested the CDS trades were Deutsche Bank's idea \u2013 something the German bank is understood to deny strongly.</p> <p>Whatever the truth, the fact that UK authorities admit they are defeated by the complexity of this case is a damning indictment of their statutory powers, and the scant resources devoted to upholding the integrity of the London financial markets.</p> <p>Take a look at the prospects for the bodies responsible for policing the City in future, and the situation only looks more alarming. Martin Wheatley, chief executive designate of the FSA's successor, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has made clear that while he wants the FCA to keep up a stream of criminal and disciplinary cases, he believes more resources should be focused on supervision that will prevent large consumer losses.</p> <p>Meanwhile, SFO director Richard Alderman will step down next month. His four-year tenure has been marked by a purge of senior staff and a 40% budget cut. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jul/24/financial-fraud-sfo-overseas-bribery?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">If it survives at all, in two years' time the SFO will have to scrape by on less than \u00a330m.</a> His successor David Green's main claim to fame is folding his last employer, the Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office, into the Crown Prosecution Service. It remains to be seen whether a similar fate awaits the SFO.</p> <p>Sadly, it seems that the coalition's bold commitment to \"take white-collar crime seriously\" with the creation of a new super-agency \u2013 merging the functions of the SFO, FSA and Office of Fair Trading \u2013 has fizzled out. Never have the words of Lord Roskill's report, which 25 years ago led to the setting-up of the SFO, rung more true. Writing in the wake of scandals in the Lloyd's insurance market, he said: \"The public no longer believes that the legal system \u2026 is capable of bringing the perpetrators of serious frauds expeditiously and effectively to book. The overwhelming weight of the evidence laid before [my committee] suggests that the public is right. While petty frauds, clumsily committed, are likely to be detected and punished, it is all too likely that the largest and most cleverly executed crimes escape unpunished.\"</p> <h2>More trouble coming down the conveyor belt at Tesco</h2> <p>Not so long ago, there looked to be five candidates at Tesco to succeed Sir Terry Leahy as chief executive. Philip Clarke got the gig and, one year on, three internal rivals have left or will do so \u2013 Andrew Higginson, David Potts and Richard Brasher. The last named was head of the UK business but Clarke has decided he wants day-to-day control of the UK stores himself, explaining there can only be one captain of the ship.</p> <p>But what if Clarke's exercise in micromanagement backfires? What if sales in the UK stores continue to disappoint, despite the heavy investment that Clarke plans to unleash? What if shareholders decided a new captain is required? Where would they turn?</p> <p>Tesco's cupboard of alternative bosses suddenly looks bare. Tim Mason, 53, who joined the board as long ago as 1995, is the last man standing among the high-fliers of the Leahy regime. He was the long shot among the five candidates because he is known primarily these days as the executive struggling to put a lid on the \u00a3700m or so of losses at Fresh &amp; Easy, Tesco's US startup. But he is also deputy chief executive and group marketing director, so presumably would be first in line in an emergency.</p> <p>After Mason, though, there isn't a single executive whom the City would recognise as a credible successor. Strange as it sounds, Tesco would perhaps have to look outside its own walls for a chief executive, were Clarke to fail. That would be a first.</p> <p>Management turnover was perhaps inevitable after Leahy, who did the job for 13 years. We have seen the same plot at many other companies \u2013 disappointed candidates are inclined to leave; the new boss tends to want to stamp his authority on the company.</p> <p>If Tesco made a mistake, it is perhaps in the chairman's job. Sir Richard Broadbent has only been in place since July 2011 \u2013 that's no time at all to establish a presence as the keeper of the company flame in what could prove a tumultuous time. The Tesco boardroom looks an unpredictable place.</p>",

While petty frauds, clumsily committed, are likely to be detected and punished, it is all too likely that the largest and most cleverly executed crimes escape unpunished.\" More trouble coming down the conveyor belt at Tesco Not so long ago, there looked to be five candidates at Tesco to succeed Sir Terry Leahy as chief executive. Philip Clarke got the gig and, one year on, three internal rivals have left or will do so \u2013 Andrew Higginson, David Potts and Richard Brasher. The last named was head of the UK business but Clarke has decided he wants day-to-day control of the UK stores himself, explaining there can only be one captain of the ship. But what if Clarke's exercise in micromanagement backfires? What if sales in the UK stores continue to disappoint, despite the heavy investment that Clarke plans to unleash? What if shareholders decided a new captain is required? Where would they turn? Tesco's cupboard of alternative bosses suddenly looks bare. Tim Mason, 53, who joined the board as long ago as 1995, is the last man standing among the high-fliers of the Leahy regime. He was the long shot among the five candidates because he is known primarily these days as the executive struggling to put a lid on the \u00a3700m or so of losses at Fresh &amp; Easy, Tesco's US startup. But he is also deputy chief executive and group marketing director, so presumably would be first in line in an emergency. After Mason, though, there isn't a single executive whom the City would recognise as a credible successor. Strange as it sounds, Tesco would perhaps have to look outside its own walls for a chief executive, were Clarke to fail. That would be a first. Management turnover was perhaps inevitable after Leahy, who did the job for 13 years. We have seen the same plot at many other companies \u2013 disappointed candidates are inclined to leave; the new boss tends to want to stamp his authority on the company. If Tesco made a mistake, it is perhaps in the chairman's job. Sir Richard Broadbent has only been in place since July 2011 \u2013 that's no time at all to establish a presence as the keeper of the company flame in what could prove a tumultuous time. The Tesco boardroom looks an unpredictable place.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stepping off the District line from her Putney constituency at Westminster, transport secretary Justine Greening can hardly have failed to notice the tube station's escalators and barriers festooned in the purple regalia of a single campaign: Heathrow's continued push to build a third runway. Later this month, the government is due to publish a paper setting out whether, and how, air travel can grow. Details are likely to be few: noise and pollution will continue to be bad, \"sustainable\" aviation an aspiration. Given the coalition agreement that rules out such a runway (and any airport expansion in the south-east), the maths of marginal London constituencies and David Cameron's fading but not forgotten environmental claims, the room for manoeuvre is small. But there is one possible path \u2013 and BAA, the owner of Heathrow, is lobbying to nudge the government along it. A government consultation on capacity also being launched will pose the questions BAA wants to answer. Is there a need for more airports to meet anticipated future demand? Specifically, what are the options for \"hub\" capacity \u2013 a genus of airport that BAA insists is in a different league to Gatwick, Stansted or Manchester, and exists only in its native habitat of the M4 corridor? The orthodoxy about hubs such as Heathrow is that only a sufficiently huge airport can provide enough transfer passengers to make both connecting and long-haul routes viable, allowing the UK to be linked to fast-growing emerging markets such as China and India. Despite officially ruling out Heathrow expansion, noises emanating from the Department for Transport suggest BAA's claims won't go entirely unheard. Greening campaigned against the runway as a local MP \u2013 in fact, she was an activist running street stalls in Putney before she took up the cudgels as a prospective parliamentary candidate. The prospects of her signing off a bigger Heathrow are zero. But this a long game, and none of the previous five transport secretaries lasted more than 18 months. Lately, Greening has spoken of \"steps we can take to make the most out of existing capacity\" at Heathrow and \"maintaining competitive edge\". One apparent compromise could be getting more planes in and out under \"mixed mode\" \u2013 using both runways as air traffic controllers see fit. Let them freely manage take-off and landings and you could straighten the flight paths, reduce stacking and use less fuel. Some think even an anodyne question in the consultation asking how to make \"more efficient use of the existing capacity\" could set off a whole new battle. According to Hacan, the local Heathrow anti-noise campaign group, the rules that stipulate alternating flight patterns give residents a few hours of respite. Director John Stewart said: \"If you take that away, you could generate revolution in Richmond. It could be even more controversial than a third runway.\" Environmentalists are not the only ones to query the hub argument: plenty within the industry do too. The government has reiterated that regional airports have a big part to play. Stansted has space to grow; Luton has unveiled proposals to double its capacity to 18 million passengers a year. Birmingham International, with an imminent runway extension and a barely used pier fit for long-haul Airbus A380s, claims to be another answer to capacity constraints, especially once high-speed rail slashes journey times. EasyJet says the hub argument is \"overstated: the vast majority of passengers flying in and out of Britain's airports prefer simple point-to-point flights\". However, BAA claims that jobs and growth will be lost because new routes miss out Heathrow \u2013 a view likely to find favour with the London business groups, many Tory MPs and unions that back it. Airlines too have been vocal in their support for BAA, pointing to emerging markets Heathrow cannot serve. Richard Branson of Virgin \u2013 65% of whose fleet is at Heathrow \u2013 last week denounced a \"cowardly\" decision to halt the airport's growth. Willie Walsh of IAG, British Airway's parent airline, told the British Chambers of Commerce that anyone trying to do business with Guangzhou should start from Frankfurt rather than the capital of a country with \"no aviation policy to speak of\". Both airlines have ordered Dreamliners, the Boeing 787 said to make substantially less noise, for service by 2013-15. Capacity is not the airline bosses' only bugbear: they're even more vocal on taxation, decrying both Britain's air passenger duty and Europe's nascent emissions trading scheme as damaging to the nation. The recently unveiled sustainable aviation \"roadmap\" purports to show how ever more flights can be reconciled with halving emissions by 2050 \u2013 albeit with a large dose of good faith and by trading an awful lot of carbon permits. The framework the government now sets will have to weigh up whether Britain, and its biggest airport, really does need more flights \u2013 or if, as environmentalists say, this is the same old cry of an industry that refuses to accept its demands will never be met.",

      "bodyText": "Perhaps it's inevitable that in times of austerity, politics is fought out on ever-narrowing turf. But the discussion in the runup to this week's budget has been a particularly impoverished one. In theory, coalition government should lead to more open debate, with a wider range of views being aired in public. In practice, it has caused the pre-budget discussions that once took place behind closed doors in Whitehall to burst out into the open \u2013 at least in part so that Lib Dem ministers can salve their consciences by saying that even if they didn't get their way, they were on the side of the righteous. Any principled consideration of how best to allocate scarce resources, or shift the tax system to benefit those most in need \u2013 who, incidentally, would be most likely to spend any extra pennies they get, boosting economic demand \u2013 has been drowned out. Instead, debate in the runup to the budget has degenerated into a depressing series of tit-for-tat trade-offs \u2013 I'll swap your tycoon tax (or mansion tax, delete as appropriate) for my 50p top tax rate; give us a bonfire of labour regulations, and we'll swallow a tax raid on pension contributions. Vince Cable's mansion tax, for example, could have formed part of a sensible wider debate about how to shift the burden of taxation from earned income onto unearned assets such as property. Detached from its context and used as a bargaining chip, it became far too easy to dismiss as the politics of envy. Similarly, the decision about whether to leave the 50p top tax rate in place should have been based on the evidence about how much revenue it has raised, and whether there has been what the tax geeks euphemistically call a \"behavioural response\" \u2013 a surge in tax-dodging behaviour to get around the new rules, or an exodus of wealth-creating entrepreneurs. Instead, George Osborne appears to have been willing to trade off scrapping one of the few policies that gestured towards the rich paying their way after the crisis against sundry other political demands from the Lib Dems. It has nothing to do with what's good for the country, everything to do with pleasing key political constituencies. Gordon Brown's budgetary decision-making was hardly a model of healthy political debate. He was notoriously prone to keep as much as possible close to his chest until the last moment \u2013 an approach that conveniently overlapped with his inability to make firm decisions until the presses were rolling on the red book. That's no longer possible in these days of independent forecasting: Robert Chote's team over at the Office for Budget Responsibility needs to have plenty of notice of whatever the Treasury is planning so it can tot up the impact on the public finances. But the paucity of discussion in recent weeks springs from something deeper than the need to sketch the outlines of the so-called \"budget judgment\" early. Both parties in the coalition have nailed themselves to a central plank of economic policy: cutting the deficit \u2013 the one guiding principle on which they found they could zealously agree when they were locked in negotiations almost two years ago. Yet thus far at least, the one strategy central to the coalition agreement is failing on its own terms. The recovery has stalled. More than a million young people are out of work. The private sector remains too nervous to invest. Cable's anxieties about how growth can be restored, aired in a letter leaked earlier this month, have been widely echoed among the business community, including most recently by BA boss Willie Walsh at Thursday's British Chambers of Commerce conference. But the lack of a coherent approach to implementing the government's growth policies is just one aspect of the intellectual impasse that has characterised coalition policymaking in the past 12 months. There can be little overarching rationale for bolting a new mansion tax onto the Heath Robinson assemblage of existing property taxes \u2013 council tax, stamp duty, capital gains on second home sales. Yet it seems to be beyond the political reach of the coalition to carry out a more radical rethink. Equally, at a time when the frozen banking system is one of the key impediments to recovery, it's absurd to be negotiating with the high street lenders about using government guarantees to offer marginally cheaper loans \u2013 so-called credit easing \u2013 when the taxpayer owns a large chunk of the banking sector. Cable was absolutely right in his letter to suggest that the government \"recognise that RBS will not return to the market in its current shape and use its time as ward of state to carve out of it a British business bank with a clean balance sheet and a mandate to expand lending rapidly to sound businesses\". But such imaginative ideas don't pass muster in the governing \"quad\" of Osborne, David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander \u2013 ultra-cautious on everything but cutting and burning. Rebuilding the economy during the longest depression since the 1930s has been reduced to tactical horse-trading. The Lib Dems' great hope was that a spell in a crisis coalition would burnish their credentials as a serious governing party. Instead, as the public are battered by library closures, school cutbacks and unemployment, with no sign of recovery in sight, they will surely, rightly, conclude that the one idea around which the government coalesced has failed.",

      "bodyText": "Government plans for big food firms to help fight obesity have suffered a setback because many companies are ignoring its plea to cut the amount of fat, salt or sugar in their products. Coca-Cola, Kellogg, Danone and other major food and drink producers have shunned health secretary Andrew Lansley's appeal to make their products less energy-dense to help meet his target of people in England consuming 5bn fewer calories a day. Sainsbury, Kraft Foods, Nestl\u00e9, Tate &amp; Lyle and Unilever have also declined to sign up to a joint pledge on calorie reduction. Some firms fear that, unless all food producers undertake reformulation of their products simultaneously, those which do might see consumers rejecting their products in favour of tastier unchanged alternatives. But Pepsico, whose core brands are Walkers, Quaker, Tropicana and Pepsi, will be signing up. The non-co-operation of most companies casts serious doubt over the future of Lansley's controversial Public Health Responsibility Deal. It has been criticised for letting food firms dodge their public health responsibilities too easily by agreeing to make voluntary pledges of only limited action in return for a promise that ministers will not legislate to impose tougher rules. Last October, when launching the coalition's \"call to action\" on obesity, Lansley stressed that he was \"now challenging business to help us make even greater progress. Reducing the number of calories we consume is essential. It can happen if we continue action to reduce calories in everyday foods and drinks, and if all of us who are overweight take simple steps to reduce our calorie intake,\" he said. The pledge involves firms agreeing to implement one or more of a \"menu of options\", including \"recipe/menu changes to decrease energy density\", such as \"fat and sugar reduced in products, or substituted with other lower calorie ingredients\"; smaller portion sizes; low-calorie options, such as 99-calorie chocolate bars; and making crisps and pre-cooked chips by using \"baking\" technology rather than by traditional deep frying. The Department of Health (DH) hoped to hold a high-profile event last week to mark the Responsibility Deal's first year and announce a host of big food manufacturers as \"momentum-building exemplars\" that would implement the calorie reduction pledge. That has been delayed until later this week while further negotiations continue. But at a recent meeting of the Responsibility Deal Food Network, in which firms and the DH discuss pledges, some producers voiced fears that reformulating their products could put them at a commercial disadvantage. Professor Susan Jebb, the government's adviser on obesity, had written to firms that \"the calorie reduction pledge presents a major opportunity for the food and drink industry to play its part in supporting the population in achieving a healthier weight\". \"The food industry says it wants to become part of the solution, rather than just part of the problem,\" said Jack Winkler, a professor of nutrition policy and expert on the food industry. \"The government offered them an opportunity to do so. But it looks like many of the big players have turned it down. \"If it turns out to be true that many of the biggest food companies have refused to sign up to the 'calorie reduction' deal, that would be evasive irresponsibility by the industry, a failure for the government and a catastrophe for public health.\" Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: \"This is a huge embarrassment for the government and a big setback for the fight against obesity.\" Only legislation would ensure foods became healthier, Fry added. A spokeswoman fot the DH said: \"We have had growing business interest in the calorie reduction pledge and will announce an update on this shortly. We will continue to work hard to work with even more businesses, sign them up to more pledges and get bigger results.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In Britain's longest running comedy show, Last of the Summer Wine, life in the picturesque Yorkshire town of Holmfirth revolved around lost ferrets and wrinkled stockings. But the nostalgic comedy has been replaced by a gritty modern drama as locals fight over Tesco's plans to build a superstore it is feared could put one of the country's oldest independent retail co-operatives out of business. Mark Lewis, chairman of the Wooldale Co-Operative Society, founded in 1886, said that last year the group made a \"tiny\" profit out its three stores which were an important community service. \"Our role is to keep the village's heart beating,\" said Lewis. \"It is very difficult to see how we could survive this.\" With its honey-coloured sandstone buildings and narrow cobbled streets, Holmfirth is a must for visitors to the Peak District. Tourism brings coachloads of Last of the Summer Wine fans and is one of the reasons why it still has a bustling high street complete with butcher, baker and greengrocer. It is Tesco's second go at getting approval for a store in Holmfirth as a previous planning application for an even larger store was withdrawn in the face of fierce opposition two years ago. The retailer's renewed ambitions have split the community with an angry debate raging in the letters page of the local Huddersfield Examiner. On one side is \"Keep Holmfirth Special\" whose campaigners argue planting a supermarket on the town's outskirts will destroy the fabric of the community. The other, equally vociferous, group \"Holme Valley Voices\" argues residents, many of whom commute to work in cities such as Manchester, already drive elsewhere to buy their groceries. Tesco has been pulling out the stops to woo locals and, to the horror of some, recently sought the vicar's permission to mingle with the congregation during the ritual post-Sunday service coffee. The retail giant also funded a mailshot by the pro-store group. Holmfirth's only supermarket of any size is one owned by the large Co-operative Group. Lewis says Wooldale lost 20% of its turnover when the rival Co-op opened. If Tesco were to land a similar blow, it might have to rely on volunteers to stay in business. Tesco predicts the new store will have annual sales of \u00a326m compared with Wooldale's takings of \u00a32m. The latter has resisted folding into the larger Co-op group \u2013 as other societies have done \u2013 as a means of survival because \"they haven't got a good track record of keeping mall village stores open\", explained Lewis. The cameras stopped rolling on Last of the Summer Wine two years ago and the town has sought to move on with music and arts events. There are also other signs of progress. Planners have already given the go ahead to a branch of Lidl, which has been met with more enthusiasm as it is on a smaller scale. Tensions in Holmfirth come amid a growing debate around the future of the UK's high street, where one in seven shops now lies empty. There has been a similar row recently in Hay-on-Wye over a supermarket development. Last year a government-sponsored review by retail expert Mary Portas concluded the situation had reached \"crisis point\". Expansion of the major grocers is considered one of the biggest factors behind the decline of high streets, with the country's 8,000 supermarkets now accounting for 97% of grocery sales and a growing percentage of non-food sales. Tesco admits the store would suck nearly \u00a33.6m of business out of the town centre. Most of that would come from the main Co-op store but some \u00a3340,000 would disappear from the small businesses nearby. Tesco, however, concludes the store would not have a \"significant adverse\" impact on the town centre. The recession and internet shopping means major supermarkets are being forced to fight harder than ever for custom. At the same time large out-of-town stores are proving less of a magnet to consumers. This industry tension saw Tesco's UK head Richard Brasher sensationally quit the business last week after a row over how to revive flagging sales. \"It seems that the strategic thinking in a number of supermarkets is that building big out-of-town sheds is not the way forward now, yet the machine is ploughing on with planning applications,\" said Holmfirth campaigner Margaret Dale. A spokesman for Tesco said: \"Holmfirth is a vibrant town but many families still travel to Huddersfield and elsewhere to get their weekly shop. They tell us a new Tesco would be a real boost, saving them time by helping them shop closer to home.\"",

Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tesco admits the store would suck nearly \u00a33.6m of business out of the town centre. Most of that would come from the main Co-op store but some \u00a3340,000 would disappear from the small businesses nearby. Tesco, however, concludes the store would not have a \"significant adverse\" impact on the town centre.</p> <p>The recession and internet shopping means major supermarkets are being forced to fight harder than ever for custom. At the same time large out-of-town stores are proving less of a magnet to consumers. This industry tension saw Tesco's UK head Richard Brasher sensationally quit the business last week after a row over how to revive flagging sales.</p> <p>\"It seems that the strategic thinking in a number of supermarkets is that building big out-of-town sheds is not the way forward now, yet the machine is ploughing on with planning applications,\" said Holmfirth campaigner Margaret Dale.</p> <p>A spokesman for Tesco said: \"Holmfirth is a vibrant town but many families still travel to Huddersfield and elsewhere to get their weekly shop. They tell us a new Tesco would be a real boost, saving them time by helping them shop closer to home.\"</p>",
