      "bodyText": "When the New York Philharmonic needed cuckoo and nightingale sounds for a performance of Haydn's Toy Symphony, it was a whistle factory in Birmingham that took the call. Acme Whistles dispatched the various bird call whistles from its factory in Birmingham's jewellery quarter. It was one of the more unusual deliveries from what has become a multimillion-pound US order book for the manufacturer \u2013 which, like others in the UK, is looking across the Atlantic for export orders. The Boy Scouts of America, New York Police Department and American football umpires all deploy whistles from Acme. The Beach Boys used Acme sirens for some of their more whimsical sounds, such as in the Brian Wilson song Heroes and Villains. An army of American pet owners use its \"silent\" dog whistle and US exports make up more than a quarter of the company's annual sales of \u00a39m. Like the owners of many UK business, Acme boss Simon Topman sees transatlantic trade growing as the US economy picks up while many European markets remain mired in recession. \"I think the US market will get back to growth and we will enjoy our little bit of that growth and be happy bunnies,\" he says. \"I can't see any prospect of real growth in Europe for many years.\" Founded in the 1870s, Acme made the first Metropolitan police whistle in 1883, and now manufactures 83 kinds of whistle, exporting to 119 countries. Like most UK exporters looking beyond Europe, it sells to the fast-growing Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 it makes mountains of samba whistles for the Rio carnival). But its biggest market remains the US. \"It is the biggest collection of rich people in the world,\" says Topman, walking around the warren of rooms that has housed Acme for a century. \"Yes, Brazil is coming up. Yes India is coming up. But India has about 200 million rich people \u2013 that's nothing like as big as America.\" The latest official trade data confirms a trend Topman and other manufacturers know well. Exports of goods to non-EU countries rose by 10% in March to \u00a313.1bn, overtaking those to the EU, which stagnated at \u00a312.6bn. Exports to the US did especially well, up 21% on the month before. Monthly trade data can be erratic, but longer-term figures show an even more dramatic shift away from Europe. In 2002, around 62% of the UK's exports went to the rest of the EU. In 2012 that had dropped to 51%. Business groups expect exports to the US to grow in terms of goods and of harder-to-measure services, such as banking and insurance. Rachel Pettigrew, senior economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF says exporters are looking to the US as a market that historically leads recoveries: \"Anecdotally, the prospects of exports to US markets look much more positive \u2026 and the US, when it comes out of recession, does tend to pick up more quickly.\" The EEF forecasts that the eurozone economy \u2013 already in its longest recession since the single currency launched in 1999 \u2013 will shrink again this year while the US will grow by 2.5%. The eurozone is the only area in the world where more members see business falling rather than growing. In the US, manufacturers are seeing solid demand in many sub-sectors, particularly aerospace, mechanical equipment and transport. The US push to be a net exporter of energy is driving up demand for oil exploration and extraction equipment, and that, too, is benefiting UK firms, according to Steve Brittan, managing director of BSA Machine Tools, also in Birmingham. More than 50% of his company's exports are oil-related, such as the lathes it sells to companies in Houston. Brittan concedes that there are plenty of competitors around the world making lathes, including in the US, but says British manufacturers have a particularly good reputation. \"We have great technology here, and lots of things have been invented and discovered here, from the internet to DNA. We are well-respected.\" Topman at Acme Whistles tells a similar story: \"In Thailand some whistles are selling at a tenth of our price but they are still buying ours. The reason is quality.\" He also puts the company's export growth down to its new inventions, which have included the first lifejacket whistle, developed in the 1940s, and the \"world's most powerful whistle\", used by officials at the London 2012 Olympics. \"We are the guys who made whistles for the Titanic in 1912, but we are also the guys who made the Tornado 2000 that was used in the Olympics in 2012,\" says Topman, sitting in a room lined with glass cabinets full of his products. A few minutes down the road, at Birmingham's ICC conference centre, businesspeople from both sides of the Atlantic are looking to reap the benefits of growing UK-US trade at this year's British American Business Council (BABC) conference. For David Allen, over from the Cleveland chapter of the BABC, there are financial incentives to trading with the UK, such as low corporation tax relative to much of the rest of Europe, but also less tangible reasons: \"I think there is definitely a kinship that we feel to the UK that we don't feel to anyone else.\" It is a kinship that many US businesses say prompts them to choose the UK as a way into the wider European market. But how the special relationship will fare as the UK continues to question its position within Europe is a hot topic. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, warned delegates last week that this was an \"unnecessary distraction\": \"The recent tussle presents an inward-looking picture of British politics. For those of us in the business world, it feels like a diversion from what we should be doing in Europe, which is restoring growth through trade deals, and championing the reforms that we want to see.\" The deal Cridland and other business leaders want is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a proposed free trade pact that seeks to eliminate or minimise barriers everywhere, from automotive to pharmaceuticals industries, services, agriculture and investment. David Cameron used his trip to the US last week to emphasise the potential gains the government sees from a free trade area \u2013 as much as \u00a310bn to the UK economy and \u00a363bn to US GDP. Negotiations on such a deal will kick off next month when President Barack Obama is in Northern Ireland for the G8. But John Longworth, director general of British Chambers of Commerce, says the government could do more: \"There was some \u00a3667bn of public sector spending last year and \u00a3300m was spent on trade support.\" UK Trade and Industry, the government's trade promotion body, argues that it still helped nearly 3,000 UK firms do business in the US last year, and was involved in bringing around 200 investment projects to the UK. But Longworth says exporters in Germany, France and Italy get more government help. \"Small and medium-sized businesses are the engine of the economy, the future corporates, and if we are going to have an economic future we need to get these businesses exporting. But to do that you need quite a bit of hand-holding.\" California dream come true Joe Frankel's eco-friendly packaging business has come full circle. Frankel was working in California in 2006 and recalls his wife returning from a San Francisco farmers' market with a yogurt and \"a lovely spoon\" that reminded him of his grandmother's tableware. It was also the first fully biodegradable spoon he'd seen. He later quit his job as a researcher at Edinburgh university to launch a compostable tableware business, Vegware, which expects global turnover of \u00a39m in 2013. Vegware now exports more than 250 compostable products \u2013 napkins, cups and plates as well as spoons \u2013 to the US, California included. Frankel started running the business full-time in 2008 \u2013 just as the global economy tipped into its worst recession in 70 years. The first few years were full of hairy moments, not least because the company's bold plan for growth meant two years of debt. He says he was inspired by California's \"have-a-go attitude\" to creating a perfect business, rather than the more British approach of incremental growth that shuns losses. The business swung into profit in 2012 and now wants to expand. Based in Edinburgh, Vegware has sister companies in Connecticut, Cape Town and Sydney \u2013 a common language and similar eating habits helped it tap these markets. Frankel says the US is not just \"an enormous market\", but has much in common with the UK, right down to favouring similar-sized cups for its caffeine fixes. Jennifer Rankin World-beating bhangra Ninder Johal never doubted that Indian dance music could be sold to the world.But record companies used to laugh. \"Here is a chap who looks like he is from India, but has a strange Birmingham accent and is peddling music no one can understand,\" he says. The music industry wasn't laughing when a track from Johal's record label became a global smash hit. Bhangra classic Mundian To Bach Ke (Beware of the Boys) remixed by Panjabi MC with a sample from Knight Rider, went to No 1 in nine European countries and made the top 10 in the US. The catchy tune is a cascade of notes played on a tumbi, an Indian stringed instrument, combined with synthesiser beats, and was used in the trailer for the 2012 comedy film The Dictator starring Sacha Baron Cohen. This gave the company its US break. Another of his tracks features on a game for the Xbox 360 console from Microsoft. Johal's Nachural Group had already diversified into events management, but with cuts to the UK public sector depressing demand for conferences, he was looking out for new opportunities. The entrepreneur, who plays the tabla (drums) in his own band, decided to branch out into manufacturing club-quality speakers and audio equipment in the Black Country. \"We know the eurozone is at best flat and at worst in a recession,\" Johal says. \"We have decided to pick on growing economies, where the competition is not as entrenched or mature, and British brands are valued.\" His plans must be music to the ears of David Cameron, and Johal was one of a group of entrepreneurs who met the prime minister and business secretary Vince Cable recently to press for more support for small businesses with big export plans. Selling abroad is key to his business, he says. \"Our proudest moment is selling bhangra music back to the Indians.\" Jennifer Rankin",

We now expect positive results from the FCA's labours at the end of the summer.</p> <p>It is worth spelling out that manipulation of the oil market, which could have meant petrol prices have been far too high, would have a significant impact on the gas price too. Most of the long-term gas contracts that energy companies have needed in the past to allow them to supply UK domestic and commercial customers have been tied to oil prices.</p> <p>That historical link, which was largely used for convenience \u2013 and because no one knew how to price gas because there were so few trades \u2013 has been gradually breaking down.</p> <p>Ironically, the way it has been broken down is by relying on benchmark figures provided by price reporting agencies (PRAs) such as Platts and ICIS Heren, whose methodologies are now under fire almost daily.</p> <p>Platts, along with Norwegian oil and gas group Statoil, were also subject to the uncompromising actions of competition investigators. Statoil, BP and Shell are not just petrol providers \u2013 they are major gas traders and wholesale suppliers too.</p> <p>Domestic providers such as British Gas, through its parent group Centrica, also have big trading arms that buy and sell in the wholesale market, partly just to make money.</p> <p>All these firms tend to be extremely cagey about exactly how many staff they employ in such operations, and are reluctant to provide details of how financially successful they are, aware that such \"speculation\" is considered a dirty word in public circles.</p> <p>The energy companies also use the trading markets for hedging their holdings in the physical market. And it is not just power companies that speculate \u2013 the banks are big players too. Barclays has recently been threatened with fines of nearly \u00a3300m for allegedly distorting Californian energy markets, a charge it denies.</p> <p>The whole issue of potential rigging of energy markets really hit the public domain last November when our sister paper, the <em>Guardian</em>, published the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/12/libor-like-manipulation-gas-markets\" title=\"\">claims of a whistleblower</a> \u2013 Seth Freedman, who had been working for ICIS \u2013 that traders had been trying to influence the wholesale gas market on 28 September 2012 \u2013 a key date, as it marks the end of the gas financial year.</p> <p>That story triggered inquiries by the FCA and Ofgem, both into the market trading itself and into the PRAs that collect market data and then set prices. Now everyone in the industry is suddenly appearing to be wise after the event.</p> <p>Robert Campbell, a former price reporter at another PRA, Argus \u2013 he is now a staffer at Thomson Reuters, which also competes with Platts and others on providing energy news and data \u2013 said this a few days ago in a little-noticed commentary: \"The vulnerability of physical crude price assessments to manipulation is an open secret within the oil industry. The surprise is that it took regulators so long to open a formal probe.\"</p> <h2>Wage lag holds back recovery</h2> <p>The British consumer's confidence remains fragile. Who says so? Phil Clarke, the chief executive of Tesco, marking the publication of the supermarket's quarterly snapshot of how its customers are feeling. The mood is a bit less downbeat than it was at the end of 2012, but, Clarke says, consumers are adapting to a \"new normal\" of low growth.</p> <p>The detail of the survey shows why a spending spree this summer looks unlikely. Two out of five Tesco customers say their household finances have worsened over the past few months, with the main sources of pressure reported as being bills, food prices and travel costs.</p> <p>Discretionary spending power continues to be squeezed because a larger chunk of household income is going on fuel, grocery bills and simply getting to work. Within the last six months, 30% of those customers questioned by Tesco said they had dipped in to their savings to cover their&#xa0;spending, while 27% of respondents said that they had cut back on essentials.</p> <p>The survey was only started in 2010, so it doesn't have that much of a track record. But the message \u2013 that consumer confidence is only marginally higher than it was when the coalition government came to office in the spring of 2010 \u2013 is consistent with an economy struggling to get out of&#xa0;first gear.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why this is. As last week's data on the labour market showed, average earnings were only 0.4% higher in the three months to March than a year earlier \u2013 the lowest rate of growth since the depths of the slump in 2009.</p> <p>Wages are simply not keeping up with prices, which were up 2.8% in the year to April, and that is why consumers are finding life tough. Things may improve on the inflation front, starting this week, but only gradually. It will take time for wages to grow more rapidly than prices, but until real incomes do pick up the economy will remain weak.</p> <h2>At last, the AGM avenger</h2> <p>Anyone attending an annual general meeting will know they are a stage for small investors to vent their anger at company bosses for poor performance and shockingly high pay packets.</p> <p>These are the shareholders who do not get private audiences with directors in the way the big City institutions do, so hundreds of them take the opportunity for the annual face-off with board members \u2013 often with a free lunch thrown in.</p> <p>But AGMs should not just be an arena for small investors. Anyone with savings in an investment or pension fund should expect the institution to which they entrust their money to turn up at these events too. All too often they do not: and even if they do, they rarely raise their hands to speak. So three cheers for Guy Jubb of Standard Life Investments.

While the Office of Fair Trading gave the petrol companies a clean bill of health after a cursory examination barely four months ago, the competition authorities in Brussels have just knocked down the corporate doors in their first move on alleged market manipulation. The Serious Fraud Office in London is now trying to get in on the act by saying it is considering whether to act against BP, Shell and others named in the commission's probe, which is reviewing trading going back 10 years. Meanwhile Ofgem, the energy regulator, is still limping along trying to review alleged manipulation of the gas market \u2013 although, fortunately, the Financial Conduct Authority has ramped up its own more sophisticated \"review\" of the same facts. We now expect positive results from the FCA's labours at the end of the summer. It is worth spelling out that manipulation of the oil market, which could have meant petrol prices have been far too high, would have a significant impact on the gas price too. Most of the long-term gas contracts that energy companies have needed in the past to allow them to supply UK domestic and commercial customers have been tied to oil prices. That historical link, which was largely used for convenience \u2013 and because no one knew how to price gas because there were so few trades \u2013 has been gradually breaking down. Ironically, the way it has been broken down is by relying on benchmark figures provided by price reporting agencies (PRAs) such as Platts and ICIS Heren, whose methodologies are now under fire almost daily. Platts, along with Norwegian oil and gas group Statoil, were also subject to the uncompromising actions of competition investigators. Statoil, BP and Shell are not just petrol providers \u2013 they are major gas traders and wholesale suppliers too. Domestic providers such as British Gas, through its parent group Centrica, also have big trading arms that buy and sell in the wholesale market, partly just to make money. All these firms tend to be extremely cagey about exactly how many staff they employ in such operations, and are reluctant to provide details of how financially successful they are, aware that such \"speculation\" is considered a dirty word in public circles. The energy companies also use the trading markets for hedging their holdings in the physical market. And it is not just power companies that speculate \u2013 the banks are big players too. Barclays has recently been threatened with fines of nearly \u00a3300m for allegedly distorting Californian energy markets, a charge it denies. The whole issue of potential rigging of energy markets really hit the public domain last November when our sister paper, the Guardian, published the claims of a whistleblower \u2013 Seth Freedman, who had been working for ICIS \u2013 that traders had been trying to influence the wholesale gas market on 28 September 2012 \u2013 a key date, as it marks the end of the gas financial year. That story triggered inquiries by the FCA and Ofgem, both into the market trading itself and into the PRAs that collect market data and then set prices. Now everyone in the industry is suddenly appearing to be wise after the event. Robert Campbell, a former price reporter at another PRA, Argus \u2013 he is now a staffer at Thomson Reuters, which also competes with Platts and others on providing energy news and data \u2013 said this a few days ago in a little-noticed commentary: \"The vulnerability of physical crude price assessments to manipulation is an open secret within the oil industry. The surprise is that it took regulators so long to open a formal probe.\" Wage lag holds back recovery The British consumer's confidence remains fragile. Who says so? Phil Clarke, the chief executive of Tesco, marking the publication of the supermarket's quarterly snapshot of how its customers are feeling. The mood is a bit less downbeat than it was at the end of 2012, but, Clarke says, consumers are adapting to a \"new normal\" of low growth. The detail of the survey shows why a spending spree this summer looks unlikely. Two out of five Tesco customers say their household finances have worsened over the past few months, with the main sources of pressure reported as being bills, food prices and travel costs. Discretionary spending power continues to be squeezed because a larger chunk of household income is going on fuel, grocery bills and simply getting to work. Within the last six months, 30% of those customers questioned by Tesco said they had dipped in to their savings to cover their spending, while 27% of respondents said that they had cut back on essentials. The survey was only started in 2010, so it doesn't have that much of a track record. But the message \u2013 that consumer confidence is only marginally higher than it was when the coalition government came to office in the spring of 2010 \u2013 is consistent with an economy struggling to get out of first gear. It is not hard to see why this is. As last week's data on the labour market showed, average earnings were only 0.4% higher in the three months to March than a year earlier \u2013 the lowest rate of growth since the depths of the slump in 2009. Wages are simply not keeping up with prices, which were up 2.8% in the year to April, and that is why consumers are finding life tough. Things may improve on the inflation front, starting this week, but only gradually. It will take time for wages to grow more rapidly than prices, but until real incomes do pick up the economy will remain weak. At last, the AGM avenger Anyone attending an annual general meeting will know they are a stage for small investors to vent their anger at company bosses for poor performance and shockingly high pay packets. These are the shareholders who do not get private audiences with directors in the way the big City institutions do, so hundreds of them take the opportunity for the annual face-off with board members \u2013 often with a free lunch thrown in. But AGMs should not just be an arena for small investors. Anyone with savings in an investment or pension fund should expect the institution to which they entrust their money to turn up at these events too. All too often they do not: and even if they do, they rarely raise their hands to speak. So three cheers for Guy Jubb of Standard Life Investments. He has travelled from Edinburgh to London to publicly berate bosses at the AGMs of BP and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance in recent weeks. His rivals should be ashamed.",

He always wanted more. Hence the expression \"a sop to Cerberus\", meaning a futile gift of a morsel that only leaves the hound baying for more. I am not suggesting for one moment that Ukip or the Tory party are dogs. But the expression \"a sop to Cerberus\" \u2013 much favoured by my classics master in days gone by \u2013 does keep coming to mind, with our beleaguered prime minister in the increasingly frustrating position of delivering the sops. Mythical history does not relate whether there are also pigeons at the gates of Hades. But if there are, my old friend Lord Lawson has certainly thrown a cat among them with his Ukip-style call for us to leave the European Union altogether \u2013 he who himself lives a fair proportion of the year in la belle France. Lawson likes the way of life in France. So do many of us, who seize every opportunity to relish it \u2013 unlike, it seems from recent opinion polls, the French themselves, who are not as content as we thought. It was admiration for the standards of the French and other European health systems that prompted New Labour to devote a fair proportion of the budget to modernising our own NHS. Further back, envy of what was perceived as superior economic performance was one of the main reasons why our nation applied to join what was then the Common Market. Whether they vote Conservative, Labour or otherwise, the British people are fundamentally conservative. In the 1975 referendum they always seemed likely to vote to stay in, rather than take a leap outside. And, whatever the opinion polls show now, I suspect that if this new proposed referendum ever takes place, there will once again be a vote for staying in. But what a lot of time would be wasted meanwhile! As older readers will know, I have always regarded the EU, for all its irritations, as what the authors of 1066 and All That would have described as a Good Thing. But the eurozone was a step too far, and it is to the credit of John Major that we \"opted out\" and to the credit of Gordon Brown that Tony Blair's pressure to join was resisted. The ultimate irony was the spectacle last week of David Cameron, in his capacity as this year's chairman of the G8, representing the EU in early discussions with President Obama about a proposed free trade area with the US, while back home his MPs and even ministers were calling for our complete withdrawal from the EU. As the president reminded Cameron, it is in the UK's best interests to remain in the EU. He could have added that membership of the EU and exemption from the eurozone gives us the best combination. Freedom from the constraints of the single currency has enabled us to secure a devaluation that, according to the latest estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility, produced a gain in net trade (exports minus imports) equivalent to 2% of GDP between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2010. Recent figures have not been so good, but have been distorted by the vagaries of production of North Sea oil. The governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, pointed out last week that since 2007 and the devaluation, the trade deficit (excluding North Sea oil) has averaged 1.5% of GDP compared with 3% before. Such exchange rate adjustments have not been available to the suffering southern states of the eurozone vis-a-vis super-competitive Germany. Nor, for that matter, have they been available to France. Moreover, the weaker eurozone economies have been further debilitated by austerity programmes that derive partly from the Teutonic belief that suffering does lesser economies good and partly from the way the bond markets panicked until Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to keep the show on the road. The bond markets have now woken up to the deficiencies of the austerity model. The fundamental flaws of the way the policy operates in the eurozone are well explained in the latest weekly comment from Russell Jones and John Llewellyn of Llewellyn Consulting. Coming from analysts who, unusually for this country, have been broadly friendly towards the eurozone project, their questioning of the long-term sustainability of the eurozone, on account of the asymmetrical way the rules operate, ought to be taken seriously in Berlin and Frankfurt. What makes the British economic situation so frustrating is that we are not subject to the deflationary bias of the eurozone: George Osborne and his pals have simply imposed one of their own, inventing imaginary threats from the bond markets. The cuts in social security have been especially severe for the poorest in our society. Yet, as the Child Poverty Action Group points out, the poorest spend a larger proportion of their income than other groups, and the cuts have multiplier effects that hardly encourage that elusive recovery. The cuts are not only damaging in themselves: they are what Tim Nicholls of CPAG calls a \"fiscal hindrance\" to economic recovery.

It may not be firing on all cylinders but the economy is expanding and jobs are being created.

There are three main reasons why the US has outpaced Europe in the early stages of what has proved to be a prolonged period of rehab: economic structure, policy decisions and culture. Starting with structure, America is a true single market and Europe is not. Rich states such as New York subsidise poor states in the south without the bitterness that surrounds fiscal transfers from, say, Germany to Greece. Moreover, labour-market mobility means that workers who lose their jobs in one part of the US head off to a state where prospects are brighter.

    "webTitle": "Ed Miliband vows to curb corporate tax avoidance", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ed Miliband has vowed to rip up the rule book as prime minister and go it alone if there is no international consensus to tackle multinationals engaging in massive tax avoidance. In an interview with the Observer, the Labour leader urged David Cameron to find agreement at the G8 summit of leaders next month around an ambitious agenda forcing corporate giants to pay their fair share. He said that, if Cameron fails, he himself as prime minister would unilaterally act to make multinationals operating in the UK more transparent about the money they make here, the movement of cash around their corporate structures, and the justifications for the tax they pay. He would also increase the resources of HM Revenue and Customs to strike at tax cheats. Miliband, who will speak at a Google event in Hertfordshire on Wednesday, said he believed some multinationals, including the internet giant, were not living up to their responsibilities to society. Google was accused by MPs last week of being devious, calculating and unethical after it emerged that it paid just \u00a33.4m in tax on \u00a33.2bn of sales taken from UK customers last year as the sales were technically \"closed\" in low-tax Ireland. Miliband said: \"Now, what is the politicians' responsibility: change the law. But it is also to talk about the kind of society we want to create and what the responsibilities of a company like Google are. I don't think they are living up to their responsibilities at the moment, and I will be very clear about that on Wednesday. \"It is part of a culture of irresponsibility. If everyone approaches their tax affairs as some of these companies have approached their tax affairs we wouldn't have a health service, we wouldn't have an education system. And actually the point I will make at Google is that will undermine Google.\" Meanwhile Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, writing in the Observer, has given his first reaction to last week's criticism of his company by MPs on the public accounts committee. He says tax avoidance is rightly a \"hot topic\" in difficult economic times and urges genuine reform, but adds: \"Politicians \u2013 not companies \u2013 set the rules.\" But, in a major policy announcement, Miliband says a Labour government would engender a more responsible capitalism in the UK by changing those rules with or without international agreement. Miliband would: \u25a0 Pursue a new global system where multinationals must publish their revenues, profits and other key corporate information useful to revenue authorities in each country in which they operate. \u25a0 Force multinationals to publish such information in the UK even if international agreement cannot be found on the issue, as they do in Denmark. \u25a0 Make it a legal requirement for multinationals operating in the UK to disclose details of any tax avoidance schemes they are using globally. \u25a0 Seek reforms to \"transfer pricing\" rules to stop companies from shuffling money to other parts of their firm based in tax havens in return for spurious services. \u25a0 Open up the ownership of companies sited in Britain's tax havens to the UK revenue authorities, but also seek to allow developing countries access to such information. Miliband said the government was \"dragging its feet\" on the issue of tax avoidance. \"They have got to act. If they don't act, we will act in government. This is an absolutely massive and serious issue. \"I think it is a pro-business agenda to say that people should pay their fair share at the top. The head of a big British retailer came to me recently who was outraged by some of the things going on. He was saying he pays his taxes. The business world feels strongly about this. \"This has an impact on people in their daily lives. The less the big companies pay their fair share of tax, the higher tax others will have to pay, the worse the services they will receive.\"",

Google was accused by MPs last week of being devious, calculating and unethical after it emerged that it paid just \u00a33.4m in tax on \u00a33.2bn of sales taken from UK customers last year as the sales were technically \"closed\" in low-tax Ireland.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"Now, what is the politicians' responsibility: change the law. But it is also to talk about the kind of society we want to create and what the responsibilities of a company like Google are. I don't think they are living up to their responsibilities at the moment, and I will be very clear about that on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"It is part of a culture of irresponsibility. If everyone approaches their tax affairs as some of these companies have approached their tax affairs we wouldn't have a health service, we wouldn't have an education system. And actually the point I will make at Google is that will undermine Google.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/18/google-tax-reform-eric-schmidt\" title=\"\">writing in the <em>Observer</em></a>, has given his first reaction to last week's criticism of his company by MPs on the public accounts committee. He says tax avoidance is rightly a \"hot topic\" in difficult economic times and urges genuine reform, but adds: \"Politicians \u2013 not companies \u2013 set the rules.\"</p> <p>But, in a major policy announcement, Miliband says a Labour government would engender a more responsible capitalism in the UK by changing those rules with or without international agreement. Miliband would:</p> <p>\u25a0 Pursue a new global system where multinationals must publish their revenues, profits and other key corporate information useful to revenue authorities in each country in which they operate.</p> <p>\u25a0 Force multinationals to publish such information in the UK even if international agreement cannot be found on the issue, as they do in Denmark.</p> <p>\u25a0 Make it a legal requirement for multinationals operating in the UK to disclose details of any tax avoidance schemes they are using globally.</p> <p>\u25a0 Seek reforms to \"transfer pricing\" rules to stop companies from shuffling money to other parts of their firm based in tax havens in return for spurious services.</p> <p>\u25a0 Open up the ownership of companies sited in Britain's tax havens to the UK revenue authorities, but also seek to allow developing countries access to such information.</p> <p>Miliband said the government was \"dragging its feet\" on the issue of tax avoidance. \"They have got to act. If they don't act, we will act in government. This is an absolutely massive and serious issue.</p> <p>\"I think it is a pro-business agenda to say that people should pay their fair share at the top. The head of a big British retailer came to me recently who was outraged by some of the things going on. He was saying he pays his taxes. The business world feels strongly about this.</p> <p>\"This has an impact on people in their daily lives. The less the big companies pay their fair share of tax, the higher tax others will have to pay, the worse the services they will receive.\"</p>",
